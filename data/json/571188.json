Terrible to below average service at best, the place simply REEKED to high heaven of mold or mildew and that doesn't even include the fact that the stench from the smokers floors seeped to every corner of the hotel. Carpets were just freakin' filthy, there were black mildew stains on the ceiling of the shower, the toilet was almost falling out of place, wallpaper was peeling, air conditioner didn't work properly (our clothes and magazines/books actually became MORE wet in the room than they did in the car), bathroom vent fan was blown, etc, etc... The \"double\" room was so small that I could almost do a standing broad jump from the door to the window, I was actually impressed that they could fit two double beds in there. Even the cheapest of double rooms I've stayed at before have had space for a table and two chairs, this place only had one chair stuffed into a corner and that was only there to cover up an unfinished wall panel. If the normal status of the hotel is this bad, then please DO NOT try to get ice from any of the machines (even if you can find one that works), there is no doubt what-so-ever that the machine is filled with bacteria and filth and doesn't meet health standards. I've stayed in so many hotels over my life that I can't even count, but if you listen to the folks that say that this place is \"perfect for R&R\" or a \"great value\" or \"perfect for family\" then you are being misled by folks who simply don't know any better.

I would say this is an average/decent hotel. Cleanliness is #1 to me. Our room was VERY clean & the bathroom was spotless and completely remodeled which was really nice!! The rooms are small but we had \"communication rooms\" that were joined together by a decent size hallway, closet and bathroom. This made for more room for our toddler to run around in!! The lobby & entrance is very clean & nicely remodeled. The front porch was nice to sit at in the evenings & it wasn't \"packed with smokers\" like other reviews have stated (I'm a non-smoker myself). The AC's worked great & our rooms stayed very cool. The hallways are worn-down BUT it seems that PP is slowly remodeling everything & with a large hotel that takes time. I peeked in other rooms on the 3rd floor while walking by & they were remodeled as well with new baths & also looked very clean. The Pool & Hot Tubs were sparkling!!

We agree with erica2483 from Jersey Shore PA and Brianaaly from Lanham, MD. You get what you pay for. Yes, parking in the hotel parking lot is not always available but you walk out on the boardwalk and to the beach, so why are you complaining about walking a block to park. Sure your vehicle is not close but still a block isn't that far. The rooms are cleaned daily by people that we and other guest trust. They don't move your belongings to make a bed or vacuum, we know this to be true for we have a few pieces of medical equipment and they're not touched. Fact is, the bed is not made if you leave things on it. The staff, what can we say, Jackie, Adam, Jill, Christina, Rick, etc...even Tom the handy man, all are friendly and go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant as possible. I know I have missed some people but they will have to forgive us. Even DAKOTA the bird is a fixture here. So why make other peoples lives miserable because you are unhappy and like to complain, just go to another hotel.

It's also VERY family friendly (which is actually a negative for us with no kids but I can see where it's a positive for others). Even though it clearly stated everywhere not to jump in the pool, the kids are constantly doing it. They also have a very convenient location on the boardwalk. The front porch area was also nice. CONS: THE ROOM - especially the bathroom. Our bathroom had mold on the ceiling. The floor was squishy and so discolored with mold. The mirror had ?rust? spot or some other spots. The heat lamp was very rusted. Overall the room was very old, very small, smelled very must. The carpets in the rooms and hallways are disgusting!!! They haven't been washed in ages (if ever).

Wanting to stay right on the boards we selected this hotel based on location, price and availability. The lobby, front deck and pool area are not too bad but as for the room (242), we would have better off staying in the car. For starters, the moldy smell was unbelievable and only got worse when we tried to warm the room up so we resigned ourselves to keeping the AC as cold as it would go. The carpet was of the sort where we pretty much wore shoes or at least socks the entire time for fear of putting bare feet on it. Next, as other reviews have pointed out, the closet is worthless for anything longer than tee shirts owing to the mini fridge being located in there. On to the bath room. The shelf as others also pointed out is just a few inches wide and ours leaned forward so that items often fell off. The mirror is located above this and was so high that I could only see my shoulders and above being 5'6\" My wife being a little shorter found it absolutely usless. Now for the totally unbelievable part, I am sure we have all been in hotels and even home where the hot and cold faucets have been reversed, but have you ever been in a place where the hot water line was connected to the toilet? Let me say we were not impressed with having our butts steamed when using the toilet and kept the lid closed with a towel draped over it when not in use to try and keep the humidity down. The shower had next to no water pressure but we didn't stay in any longer than we needed to anyway because the bottom of the tub flexed so much we both afraid of falling through. Another really icky item was the black mold ringing the room where the wall met the ceiling as well as a thin black line around the center of the room where it looks like there was mold coming through the wall paper seam. On the way out we were chatting with a customer who said she had stayed there 30 years ago. I asked how it was then and her reply was \"the same\". To be fair, I had seen the place from the outside many times and certainly was not expecting it to be 5 star resort, but this was crazy bad. I mean Bates Motel bad. Anyone who is giving this 5 stars or claiming this is a great place to stay is either an employee making a bogus review or some college kid who is out partying all night and just needs a place to pass out. Trust me, I have stayed in many, many places and this was the second most icky but that place was only $49 a night, not $159.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lanham, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBest place in OC\u201d", "Author": "BrianaAlyse", "ReviewID": "UR116623069", "Content": "First Ide like to say Ive been going to Ocean City for 15 years at least twice every year so Ive had my share of experiences...

I was very surprised at how nice and clean the place was. We got there early and they immediately checked us in and had the room and a parking permit ready. There are two sets of elevators and carts to help bring your bags up. Theres also a really nice set of swinging chairs by the pool/bar entrance. Also alot of fully stocked vending snack and bev. machines. So the room was pretty nice. Brand new bathroom with large tub and wide spray shower. Also a mini fridge. In the room we stayed in there were two beds fitting two people in each comfortably. The only thing was that there was no closet or drawrs to put clothes in so we had to live out of our bags, which was OK with us. There wasn't any noise or anything from the bar or boardwalk we slept like baby's. The cleaning service was great..for some reason we'd always run into them in the hall so we just told them if we needed new sheets or more towels. The location was GREAT! Its right on 2ND st. on the boardwalk (by the large gallery store) It was a short walk to the dough roller hooters and other food places and its a closedrive to all the fun places in OC. theres also a large deck with chairs for people watching. During the stay I developed a very soar throat so I tryed out the small coffee stand directly outside of the hotel on the deck. The lady with long dreads who runs it is great :) she knew exactly what I needed for my throat..just tell her what you like/need and she'll have some thing for you! They have two parking lots, the first one is right by the hotel but its veryy cramped (we actually backed up into the wall bc it was so close), the other parking lot is about a block away and is where we left our car the majority of the trip.

Yes, the rooms are small and the building is old, so the rooms do smell a little musty but it's nothing you can't deal with. The bathroom is tiny, but clean and the water temps do fluctuate quite a bit but it's a small price to pay for the great location, prices and service. Beds were clean and comfy, they provided brand new fluffy pillows our first day here and the AC is great! We were scared that we would have bad serive since we booked online and others had bad experiences but instead they upgraded our room to an ocean view on the 4th floor and were very welcoming. Room service is extremely friendly and helpful and did everything they could to help us out. Vending machines are CHEAP! $1 soda bottles and waters throughout the hotel and cheap energy drinks and gatorades which came in handy for us. The only complaint I had was that there was really nowhere to hang wet bathing suits and towels to dry. Pool and pool bar are really cute and so much fun. They have poolside service and the carribean bar is such a fun atmosphere. They were very strict about ID-ing, so we didn't have to deal with any obnoxious teens around the pool area. Dakota, the pool bird is an awesome addition and they tested the pool and hot tub levels every few hours. Drinks are awesome, decently priced at $6 for mixed drinks, food is great and bartenders and waitresses are very friendly. We spent the majority of our vacation pool side and couldn't have been happier. You do have to get there before 12 to get a chair though. Location is awesome, smack dab in the middle of the boardwalk. Ocean area is very clean and wasnt too crowded.

We almost had a third person coming and we were lucky they didnt come down. The bathroom was tiny, about just enough space for it to be usable. The room also had a musky smell too it, but it was clearly because its an older hotel. Outside of that though, the room was very clean, and didnt look old. I noticed that they gave you full cable access as well, including pay channels at no extra cost, we didnt watch much tv while there but I did notice. The staff was extremely friendly, on July 4th weekend you would expect the opposite because the hotel was extremely busy, down from front desk, to maintenance, to maids, to the service at the pool bar. At one point the pepsi machine outside was giving out the wrong sodas and I told the staff and she kindly refunded me the money and then put a sign outside, its not much but again the manner in which this was done was pleasent, for all she knew I might have been lying. The best feature about the hotel is there pool and outdoor bar area, its huge, their pool is big, as well as their main bar which has a decent selection of food as well, their service was kind and had a fun, happy, attitude. They also had live music every night we were there and over the weekend they had live music from noon to midnight. Most of the bands were very good and they had a wide variety of music played. The pool bar is open to the public as well, but the pool and 3 jacuzzis are hotel guest only and they were extremely good at keeping anyone who wasnt from the hotel out, I was actually amazed at how well they were doing recognizing who they had to confirm as a guest. Their is also a buffet restaurant the Paul Revere in the lower level of hotel that is pretty good, and for only $13 a adult, I beleive it was only open early afternoon till the evening but it was extremely busy but they did well getting people in and out. There was another restaurant bar on the boardwalk side of the building but I am not sure if its part of the hotel itself. But that is 3 choices to eat immediately accessible to eat right from your hotel. They also have a smoothie bar on the boardwalk side, as well as a large sitting area on the boardwalk, you can drink out there as well if you want because it is still part of the hotel. Its also probably one of the best areas and hotel to watch the fire works from during 4th of July. Last the parrot, Dakoda, makes for a little entertainment when he is in the lobby or around the pool bar area. Sometimes he'll greet you. All and all if you are looking for a decently priced hotel, arent traveling with that many people, want to be on the boardwalk, arent going to spend too much time in your room, I would recomend this place.

Plus, we still talk about the grossness. I spent my summers in college working at Paul Revere's below The Plim, as we affectionately called it. If anyone would look for the silver lining in this place, it is me. I just cannot find it, though. The place was DISGUSTING. I went in 2008 with my three girlfriends. A the time, we were in our late 20's and our hotel standards were pretty low. All we wanted was a clean place to crash at night. When we first walked to our room, the smell of the place was overwhelming. We felt like we were back in college. The halls smelled stale and so many of the guests left their doors wide open while they lounged around the rooms. I know this is no fault of the hotel, but it was just...weird. We could look in and see people still in bed in their undies! Our room - WOW! The wallpaper was coming off. There were stains all over the place - the mattresses, carpeting, walls, ceiling. It was disgusting. None of us walked in our bare feet. We had to brush our teeth in the tub because the sink would clog up and would not drain for hours. We were even apprehensive about taking showers there because the shower was just so gross. I know we went out a few nights with our sunscreen still on from the day because it just wasn't worth it to shower. You felt dirtier afterwards. We did buy some Lysol and clean the room ourselves the best that we could (door knobs, light switches, TV remote, alarm clock, etc.) and put up the sign asking housekeeping to not come in. You may find this extreme, but it was THAT bad. We did enjoy the staff at the desk, but we also struck up conversations with them about people we knew from our days at the Smorg (Paul Revere's). They were very sweet to us. We also LOVE the pool bar. The four of us spent many hours lounging by the pool, drinking froofy drinks and having good conversation. The location IS prime right there on 2nd and Boards. Unfortunately, the location and the pool bar, which is open to the public, are not enough for me to ever take my family there. I'd take the bus over staying at the Plim. Also, please keep in mind that this place is NOT cheap and it is suppose to be good for families.

We didn't care because we left in the morning for the beach and then went out at night. The weather was spectacular all weekend long. The air conditioner, TV, and small fridge worked great. We made our reservations just 48 hours before we checked in, so we had to stay on the smoking floor. However, our room really didn't smell bad. And we brought a scented candle, as reviewers below recommended, as well as our own towels. The staff was very responsive and friendly all weekend. The pool is incredible, but it does get packed if you get there in the afternoon. There are two poolside bars with food and the hotel had really good bands playing poolside till 11PM both nights. Frankly, you really don't need to leave the hotel for food and entertainment. There are two restaurants on site, including the \"Mug & Mallet.\" But we nonetheless walked just a few blocks to the bayside Marina Deck restaurant for lunch one day and dinner another day. The hotel's location makes it very easy to get to great places to eat, dance, etc. The Plim Plaza has a terrific front deck with comfortable chairs. Great for people watching. The hotel lobby was very clean and comfortable, with complimentary coffee all day. I think it had WIFI too. And you only walk about 20 feet from the hotel to hit the beach. The beach was crowded, but great fun. All in all, we had a wonderful time at the Plim Plaza.

Cleaning was hit&mis with some days better than others but staff willing to do whatever asked. Smell is musty and old but then it's an old motel at the beach-like another said, bring a candle. Fridge, TV, A/C, etc all worked. Besides the rooms &hallways, the rest of the hotel is open, clean and airy. Attractive expansive lobby with tables and comfy furniture for lounging, eating, watching (2)tv or gathering with other guests. Drawing card for us is the long porch and deck full of rocking chairs facing the boardwalk for sun or rain. Parking area is free, cramped & usually filled but 2 blocks away they have overflow and we never had any trouble there. This trip showed signs of some renovations. Staff was always helpful and friendly but could get short when busy. All 3 hottubs were down our first day but were fixed & filled same day and then like before quickly filled with kids. I think it should be parent required so more adults could actually use them. Pool always seemed clean and inviting, expect kid play. Caribbean rooftop outside bar has friendly fun staff, good sandwich/snack fare and drinks with a terrific variety of entertainment on weekends, which is how we first discovered the place while staying elsewhere. The bird gets moved around to its perch near the bar or inside lobby but has never been agressive unless someone is stupid enough to try to touch and even then it pecks and stops, not attacking. Lobby has microwave, coffee/tea available 24/7. Ask @desk for hot choc. No continental breakfast which was surprising. The Phillips buffet is dark inside, reasonable priced $13apprx but like most buffets variety is offset with bland taste. Desserts were good. Mug&Mallet has more variety and good food reasonable price. Plentiful restaurants of all tastes/price ranges within driving or walking range-ask at the desk they're very helpful. Also, there appears to be 'regulars' that have been going there for decades who also regroup after Labor Day for a greatly reduced 2nd season trip price of Guest Appreciation Days. They're more than willing to share the best/cheapest/etc eating places around town. In summary, It's an older place and the rooms size and oldness are its worst features but still ok. You don't need to stay in the room-even if grounded by weather the porch and lobby are available. The rest is updated, clean, open and nice.

We have stayed at the Plim Plaza for summer vacations several years in a row. The Plim Plaza is an older Hotel, right on the beach and boardwalk. The location is fantastic. The Boardwalk is right there and you can walk to everything. From the Oceanfront rooms you can see the religious sand sculptures on the beach. The Plim Plaza is the ONLY Boardwalk Hotel that I know of where you can get an oceanfront room in July or August for under $200 that has a Pool, hot tubs, Pool bar and daily/nightly entertainment. Sure, the rooms are small, but what are you going to Ocean City for??? To sit in a Hotel room day and night?? The Pool bar is great and somewhat of a night spot for the younger crowd. I have dined at the Paul Revere Buffet Restaurant and found it to be fine. There is also another Restaurant called The Mug and Mallet. The Gourmet Coffee Bar located on the porch is great, but it should be open longer. The big wide porch is so nice in the morning, sipping some hot coffee and watching the sunrise. (For all you early risers!) As for the Parrot in the lobby, if you are dumb enough to stick your fingers/arm in a cage, then you deserve anything you get!

I observed a couple of people that made a waitress and the guy with the straw hat that handles the bird and cleans up around the pool aware of the feces in the pool. The straw hat guy left and did nothing. The waitress thought it was funny and told other staff members which also got a laugh. Needless to say we didn't take a swim.

We didn't pay for it, so we didn't mind as much. Had I paid, I'd have been dissapointed. The first problem with this hotel is the parking. They say it has four parking lots on the web site, but they don't tell you the other three are a couple blocks away and you have to cross the busy highway. The parking that is right at the building is very limited and on a first come first serve basis. You can pull up and drop off your luggage, but you have to wait in line and it's very cramped. It's very inconvenient that your car is two or more blocks away from the hotel. With the rooms being smaller than normal, there is no room for beach chairs or surf boards in your room. Who wants to walk two blocks each way before and after they go to the beach with beach gear. Ocean City streets are not a thrill to cross any way. The hallways in this hotel are in need of new wallpaper and are very musty with carpet stains. If you didn't go any farther than the hall, you would swear this hotel was a dump. Thankfully the rooms are better than the halls. The hotel room is small. It's the smallest i've ever been in. It would be ok for a couple, but we had our two children with us and it was to close of quarters for four days. Granted, you may spend a lot of time out on the beach or shopping, but if it rains your in for a long haul if you have to be cramped up in one of these rooms. The room was clean, but not clean enough that you would feel comfortable without shoes on your feet. This was hard for us because we had a three year old who kept trying to sit on the floor. The wallpaper was torn in some spots and very dingy. The bathroom looked very clean. I have seen other reviews that said the maid service was poor, but it was very good for us. The building is made of wood and I wasn't real comfortable knowing that if it caught fire it would go up quickly. The rooms have no balconies so if the hall is blocked by fire on an upper floor you'd be toast. The pool and bar area is nice but no one is there to keep pool goers under control. The water was also freezing cold. I'm not being picky either. You know when its to cold enough that the kids don't want to stay in......it's pretty cold. We did not try the hot tubs because they were always crowded. The lobby is very nice and we all enjoyed the birds. They even have a talking parrot that was a blast to listen to. The porch area is nice with rocking chairs for watching the boardwalk.

I dont stay at the Plim for it's poshness. I stay there because it represents an excellent value for what you need at the beach. I emphasize need, not want.

The pool is huge for being in the city. Poolside tikibar/grill service, Need I say any more?. Live entertainment daily. Rooms are a little smallish and the Hotel has a little age on it. It is one of the oldest on the beach besides the Atlantic Hotel which is ancient. Periodic remodelings keep it fresh though. I like to think that staying at the Plim is like deluxe camping.
