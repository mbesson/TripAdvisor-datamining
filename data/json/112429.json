I must say I had no significant complaint at all with this hotel during the entire week staying there. The worst I can come up with is hearing the neighbors thru the adjoining door occasionally. The best included the cleanliness, the attention to detail with lighting and electrical outlets, the comfortable furniture, the robes, the great shower, the refrigerator, the windows can open, the wide and well lit hallways (although too warm) and of course an excellent king bed. The restaurant was always convenient for a quick happy hour and even allowed me to take a drink or a dessert upstairs; the concierge went out to the store to deliver me a Sunday NY Times newspaper. There is a great coffee shop across the street and the stunning Paramount Theater down the block. Of course, walking downtown was easy.

May be just a problem with that room and wasn't a big issue only being there for the one night. The room-service was way overpriced for mediocre food though.

Then, when I went down to the restaurant to have breakfast, we were seated at a table and our assigned server (who we didn't know was our server at the time) walked past us a few times before even saying hello. After he did come over, the service was still not good. My food had something wrong with it and I wanted to say something but again, he just kept walking past us, conveniently behind the sushi bar thing so he didn't have to make eye contact. Whether this was a conscious decision or not, I couldn't tell.

Two blocks away from all the shopping,Nordstrom, Barnes and Noble, West lake center and the monorail 3 blocks down. Pike Place market is about 6 blocks down on the same street. Don't know the concierges name, it would be the older man in the morning but he had great recommendations for restaurants, each one excellent and was so knowledgeable about the city and when was the best times to go to events.

Pros: - the room was cute, small, comfy bed. - The price was a bit less than other hotels in the area, but not by much. The decor is funky modern, which is nice. - Waffle weave robe was nice, though it was balled up on the top shelf of the closet. Cons: - my room was very dark, even with the lights on. I kept getting surprised at how bright and beautiful it was outside because from my room it looked very, very dark and overcast at all times. Part of that is the huge hotel next door with a giant concrete side facing the Paramount. But even the lighting was dim, making it very hard to see anything at all like a book before bed, or a smudge of something on your face in the mirror. - front desk staff was indifferent and only gave what I would consider \"key\" information when asked directly. I had to ask about the credit card hold (my room was paid for by my employer, so when they asked to run my credit card for \"incidentals\" I was curious what those might be...) and their answers were very brief. \"Incidentals\". \"Anything you might use\" \"It's just a deposit\". Answers like that, no eye contact, no real interest in communication. - the layout of the room and bathroom I found a bit odd. The sink was outside the bathroom proper, which is completely fine and nice, but the bathroom itself was absolutely tiny and once again VERY dimly lit. Close the shower curtain and it's nearly dark in the shower with the lights fully ON. I hated that. The vent in the bathroom is also just a passive vent (there's no exhaust fan!!) and smack staring you in the face like a giant hole in the wall when you're showering. I'm not sure it did vent the place at all, considering the spots of mildew on the wallpaper, and it was creepy to have to stare into the black hole vent while showering. And also ineffective for anything else you might want in an exhaust fan in a bathroom, if you get my drift. - the coffee 'station' was located under the tv, though the water and outlet would have to come from the sink that had plenty of underneath storage. Not sure why they made it that way. In-room coffee was cheap stuff, tea was \"lipton\" and there was a single powdered creamer and no sugar or sweetener or stirrer. Weird - this is Seattle, surely there must be some coffee pride here! - there was a small fridge but no microwave. Odd. If I had leftovers I'd want to zap them warm at least. But no. - the restaurant attached to the hotel was tasty but expensive, and the bathroom was oddly located out of the restaurant, through the hotel lobby, up the elevator and on the second floor of the hotel. So anyone getting tipsy (or worse) at the bar will eventually be in the elevator with you going up, drunkenly commenting on the oddness of the bathroom placement. That was an elevator experience I could have done without. Overall I wasn't overwhelmed with the Paramount experience.

The room renovation last year gave the rooms a very modern, clean, and comfortable look and feel. The use of top sheets as opposed to duvets gives you an extremely clean feeling, and the beds are some of the most comfortable beds I've slept in. There aren't really very many views to be had from the rooms- at best you will get an east facing view towards the highway- all other rooms look towards the other taller hotels and offices in the area. Even with the windows open, there is hardly any noise from the streets. With the windows closed, the rooms are dead silent. The minifridges the rooms is very convenient if you have medications or just like to have your own cold drinks. The valet parking is $27/night- comparable to all the other hotels in the area- and even the open lot across the street is $25/24 hrs for self-park. Just one beef with the valet- the main lot they use is about 10 mins away from the hotel, so there can be a bit of a wait to get your car back if check-out time is busy. The front desk staff are all friendly and polite- ask for Mike- he's very helpful in helping you locate obscure restaurants, clubs, and other tourist traps in the city. The Dragonfish Cafe has a funky asian-fusion theme. The staff are very friendly and professional and exude a relaxed vibe... perhaps a bit too relaxed; this restaurant doesn't make much effort to sell its services and can be a little slow at times. Excellent martinis.... but again, the staff need to be a bit more dilligent in watching for empty drink glasses- with the excellent food and drinks, the restaurant could probably make more money if their staff had a better sales/service ethic. The hotel's proximity (200yds/200m) from The Paramount Theatre make it an ideal location to stay if you want to see a show- in fact, it was Mike who recommended I see \"Wicked\". With his enthusiasm for his job, makes me wonder if he's getting sales commission! The wireless internet is $9.95/day, which is annoying when most places provide free internet. You can use the computers in the lobby business centre for free though. A swimming pool and jacuzzi tub would give this hotel a comfortable place to relax and make it more of a destination rather than just a nice place to sleep in between trips out on the town. Promixity to the Washington State Convention Centre, prime downtown shopping, Pike Place Market, the monorail to the Space Needle, and the closest hotel to Seattle's gay district on up Pine Street (15 min walk away) make this hotel a well rounded property for just about anybody on a trip to Seattle for both business, tourism, and nightlife. Overall, given the quality of the rooms, the service, the location, and the price....

The bathroom was of an adequate size with good water pressure and plentiful hot water. Much has been written by prior travelers of the excellent hotel service. I cannot agree. We took the airporter bus to a dropoff a block and a half from the hotel and carried our bag to the hotel. No big probem. The bellman is located inside the hotel itself and so didn't see us until we were virtually at the check-in desk. He inquired if we needed assistance and indeed provided gracious and helpful assistance. The check-in was perfunctory, polite and correct ... nothing more. As my wife's back condition required that she use a portable heating pad we came downstairs after checking into the room and inquired about the availability of a microwave to warm the heating pad. (The room has a small fridge and coffe maker but no microwave.) The bellman was very helpful. He told us the only microwaves were in the staff break room, and personally went with us to help us warm the heating pad. When we later returned from dinner we asked the same bellman to again assist us with the microwave. He shamefacedly told us he could not do so, as he had been instructed by management not to allow such assistance. (He later admitted he had been chewed out by management!) He told us to go to the hotel's attached restaurant, Dragonfish, and they would assist us. We were told by the restaurant manager, very brusquely, that they would not allow us to use the microwave, as only food could go into the microwave. (On many subsequent trips to restaurants in Seattle, and elsewhere, we were never turned down by another restaurant.) Perhaps this rejection was a small thing, given the other qualities of the hotel, but it left a bad taste in our mouth, particularly as the bellman was reprimanded for doing a small task that greatly aided a hotel guest.
