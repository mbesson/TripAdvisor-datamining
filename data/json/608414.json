It remains a favorite of mine, as I like the KuDamm zone very much - much more than Berlin-Mitte. Here there are a lot of trees and flowers, and restaurants and shops are all around you and the S-Bahn at Savigny-Platz or the U-Bahn or Buses at Bahnohof Zoo are only eight minutes away by foot. This time we stayed for five nights and rooms and service are of the same good quality. Now you have good WiFi connection in your room - free. The only handicap worth mentioning is that the elevator stops only between two floors - you have always to go a flight of stairs up or down to your room, what can be a nuisance if you have any mobility problems.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location, great value\u201d", "Author": "Navajorug", "ReviewID": "UR72433856", "Content": "My son and I stayed at Hotel Carmer 16 for 4 nights in July, 2010, as part of a 3-week vacation in Europe celebrating his high school graduation. This hotel was one of the best places we stayed during that 3 weeks. The rooms were large, well-furnished and comfortable. Ours looked out onto Carmerstrasse, which was nice in itself. The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant, but with easy access to the Zoo/Tiergarten U-bahn, S-bahn and bus station, so all of Berlin was easily and quickly accessible to us. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. We found them knowledgeable and interesting as people as well. Everyone was highly fluent in English, very helpful since my German is what I remember from 4 years in high school 35 years ago. The staff loaded us up with information, maps, brochures, and when needed could sell us transit cards, making it easy to use Berlin's excellent public transit. A special word about breakfast: it's great. Smoked salmon on rolls, fresh fruit and vegetables, but American eggs and bacon too for those who need them. Several mornings I took my pot of coffee out to the sidewalk while my son slept late, and sipped there as the world passed by. The hotel is not air conditioned. It was hot while we were there. We received fans when we checked in, and used them in the room. The heat was the only drawback of our stay.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cQuaint and Convenient!\u201d", "Author": "ASale", "ReviewID": "UR71513303", "Content": "Wonderful hotel within walking distance of the main bahnhof, Only 5 minute walk to Savignyplatz passing several great cafes a long the way.
