The room was not very large but certainly not tight even by American standards. The bathroom was beautiful and the shower was fantastic! There was a deep tub that was a welcome relaxation after walking all over the city for sightseeing. I thought that the continental breakfast was perfect, with a large selection of bread, pastries, yogurts and cereals, coffee, tea and juice, so that I could have something different everyday and they would deliver it to your room if you preferred. You could also order eggs and such which I think was included but I never did because everything else was so good.

I was very happy to be able to chat with my family back home from the comfort of my hotel room. The service was good. After having read many reviews before my trip, I was expecting exceptional service, and it was just good. The front desk staff seemed to be appreciative that I spoke in French, although I did hear them speaking very good English to other guests. One front desk clerk came up to my room to help me figure out the television; the problem ended up being that the remote wasn't working properly, so he came up because the instructions he was giving over the phone weren't working. While he was helpful, he seemed slightly irritated to be called away from his post. There was also a false fire alarm during my stay, and I had to translate for some confused guests in the lobby as to what was going on since the front desk clerk was otherwise occupied. A few things to note: 1) the hallway lights seem to be on motion sensors, so it can be dark when you get out of the elevator. I think this was a great idea, but I could see how it could be disconcerting if you weren't aware of it at first. 2) The toilet was separate from the sink/bathtub area. Everytime I used the washroom, I would have to go around to the bathroom so I could wash my hands. Seems it would make more sense to have a sink in with the toilet if you're going to separate them.

The breakfast was great and the breakfast room never felt crowded. We would eat breakfast between 8-9am, so I'm not sure if it gets crowded later. The staff was very helpful and made dinner reservations for us for three of the nights we were there. On our first day, we asked if we could drink a bottle of wine we bought in the courtyard and the response was \"Of course!\" They gave us a bottle of opener along with several glasses. My mom had brought a travel steamer that didn't work, so she put it in the trash in the room. When we came back to the hotel that evening, they kept the steamer and asked if we had meant to throw it out. I thought it was a sign of good service that they would check with us. We had a suite, which was really just a bedroom and a sitting area (with a fold-out couch) which was adequate for us. Rooms are smaller in Europe than the U.S. and I suspect most travelers already know this. There were many restaurants right near the hotel which was nice after a day of site-seeing on foot!

So until we can be together in a few months we decided to take our honeymoon 3 months after our wedding in order to maintain our ongoing lifestyle of not being together more than 3 months despite living 10,000 miles apart. So naturally I chose Paris to celebrate our honeymoon in and wanted a quaint Parisian hotel with a great location, staff and still enjoy the romantic ambience that was important to us for this special time. We were certainly not disappointed by 2 of the 3, however we did have an issue with one of the staff members. I won't bore anyone with the details because despite the rude behavior from the evening clerk the Manager, Joya I believe was her name, more than made up for this with a sincere apology and a bottle of champagne and a box of La Maisson (I think) chocolates that are simply the best I have ever eaten, although my wife hid them after I had 4 or 5 so they were the best 4 or 5 chocolates I have ever eaten! We had issues with the air conditioner and the CNN channel kept going out but we were there for Paris and not for TV so small issue but anytime I mentioned anything to the remainder of the staff it was handled right away with a smile and a sense of urgency and when you stay at a high end hotel honestly this is what you should expect. This hotel is perfectly positioned between all the places you want to be so the location is great. The rooms in paris are generally small and do not expect to find workout facilities and swimming pools. The breakfast was decent but after 9 days I wanted something different of course. It seemed like they could have changed up the muffin selection or donut selection just for a few days ughhhhhhh. The price is steep, especially with the devalued dollar, but if you are travelling to Paris just enjoy it and worry about the cost later or else you will truly not experience all there is to experience.

As a father travelling with 2 teenage children I wanted a hotel within walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower and the Louvre museum. The added bonus was that its a 10 minute walk to the 'Pont de l'Alma' metro stop for a half hour's journey to Chateau de Versailles and less than 10 minutes walk to avenue des Champs Elysees. A supermarket is 200m away and the charming and quiet side streets offer a large variety of restaurants for an afternoon drink or evening meal. I wanted an archetypal Parisienne hotel with classic decor as opposed to a modern steel and concrete skyscraper and also needed a triple room and the Chambiges Elysses offered this facility. The hotel doesn't provide a restaurant service, which suits my style of travelling as I like to explore and experience local restaurants. However, a continental breakfast buffet is provided which was exemplary and even a fussy, vegetarian, teenage daughter managed to fill up with the choices offered. The staff speak fluent English although I tried my best conversational French which seemed to get me by. A taxi service to the airport was offered twice, which was thoughtful, although I had already booked return tickets on Air France's Les Cars to CDG. Service 2 runs from exit 34 at CDG's arrivals terminal 1 and terminates at the Arc de Triomphe and is only some 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The journey itself is some 45 minutes to an hour depending on traffic and costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac24 return and runs every half hour from 6am to 11pm.

We were immediately warmly welcomed despite our inability to speak French and given our room without delay despite it being several hours before check in. When you get to your floor (there are only six, with six rooms each) the lights came on by motion sensor revealing the gorgeous woodwork that continues into the room. You leave your key in a slot inside the door to power all of the lights in the room and then simply take it out when you leave. Our room was beautiful with high ceiling crown mouldings, big floor to ceiling windows that opened into a courtyard with a garden and tables below, lovely coordinating walpaper, bed coverings, carpets and upholsteries, faux finished painted ceilings and more beautiful woodwork everywhere. Our bed was so comfortable that it was hard to get out of it. The bathroom had a large shower with great water pressure, towel warmer, shaving mirror, gorgeous stone and woodwork and private toilet area with its own door and telephone. The room also had a flat screen TV with lots of channels (at least one english speaking), a small safe, electric tea kettle, and free wifi, which is rare. As we began to explore the area we realized that the location of the hotel was equally wonderful, with the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees, the Louvre and the Arc D'Triomphe all within easy walking distance. It wasn't much more of a stretch to get to Notre Dame from the Louvre either. The streets immediately surrounding the hotel have wonderful shops and restaurants with sidewalk dining, and the Rue de Chambiges itself was a joy to come back to again and again, as it seemed to be the most quiet and peaceful of all of them, noticeable as soon as we turned the corner each time. The breakfast was quite nice, running from 7 - 11 am and consisting of a huge variety of wonderful cheeses and breads, meats, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, cereals, coffee, tea, juices and pastries. There are several rooms to eat in, all adjacent to each other and each cozy and private, including the garden courtyard. When we checked out we still had a full day in Paris before getting on a train that night and the Hotel staff easily and kindly agreed to keep our bags at the hotel all day for us while we continued to enjoy the city.

However, from our experience, it would seem that some of these members were looking through rose coloured glasses, this could easily be from having been so overwhelemed by the outstanding beauty of Paris, its buildings, statues, avenues, parks etc. Our experience of this hotel started with the elderly man on reception making a very caustic and sarcatsic remark about our surname, when we corrected him he just laughed it off. Even though we had made the booking well in advance and had also, a week before our arrival, checked to see if our reservation was in order, it took them some considrable time to find the folder containing our booking, again, no apology. If you are in any way claustrophobic don't go anywhere near this hotel, you get out of the lift (tiny & very hot) and end up in exceedingly narrow, very dark (no windows anywhere) corridors and are followed around by automatic emergency lights, flicking on and off as you progress, there is hardly room to carry your case along. The room was of a satisfactory size but with very dismal wallpaper and depressing curtains with a lot of dark wood everwhere, again, dingy. Also, if you don't like to by cramped and squeezed up while having your breakfast, don't try here, the tables must have come from a cocktail bar somewhere, there is absolutely nowhere to put your cups and plates. The food selection is most disappointing, and the area where you have to serve yourself just about allows one person in at a time. If the door is left open to the tiny patio area, then the eating area becomes full of smoke from the guests out there. The coffee was poor and not hot. On the TV, if you are English speaking, you can only get BBC World News 24 hours a day. There are many, many satellite programmes for free in English available all over the world. They offer a coffee/tea making facility, however, you are only supplied with one ration of tea/coffee on arrival, if you are staying more than one night you have to keep going down to reception to ask for refills and this proceedure can take time while to porter goes to find it in the kitchens. Do not be mislead by the hotel's hyp that the Champs Elysees is just round the corner, it is NOT nor is the Eiffel Tower, they are a considerable walk away, more deception! When we booked we asked for a quite, non-smoking room as high as possible, we got ... a smoking room, ashtrays everywhere, double bed, 1st, floor right oposite a bar/restaurant which kept us awake every night until 3am., when we complained about this the management of the hotel told us \"it has nothing to do with the hotel, it is not our problem\", it is their problem, the hotel is situated in a residential zone with a police station right next door, the management should have made an official complaint to the police and had the bar close down at a reasonable hour, A total disrespect for the hotel guests. We found that the majority of the staff had a superiority complex and enjoyed talking down their noses at the guest (especially those who were not French). It is, in our considered opinion, a hotel that is highly overpriced with an owner/management team who are perfectly happy to con their unsuspecting guests. It also does not deserve the 4 stars they display and to that end we are going to write to the French Minister of Tourism, M. Herv\u00c3\u00a9 Novelli to ask him to have the establishment re-assessed, 3 stars would be more than enough! Perhaps this will force the management in to providing better facilities, staff and honesty. Another annoying and deceiptful trick of the hotel was that, on arrival at CDG airport in Paris, we took a 'taxi parisien' to the hotel (by the way we did not find one taxi driver in Paris who knew or could find the hotel - watch out for high taxi fares while they try to get you there), the cost from airport to hotel was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac34.50, so, a full 24 hours before our departure from the hotel we asked the reception to order a 'taxi parisen' to take us back to the airport. We waited in the lobby and were informed, more or less on time, that the taxi was here, we went out to find a minbus waiting, in good faith we got in but it was only some minutes later we realised it did not have a meter, so when we arrived at the airport we had a demand for double the cost ie. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70, we tried to get the price reduced but were told that he had a good commission to pay the hotel and that was why the price was so high........... so yet another con trick by the Hotel Chambiges Elysees.

We checked in at 10pm with no issues, the reception clerk was very helpful and suggested places to eat in the late evening. He spoke excellent English despite my attempts to use school boy French. The room was small but beautifully decorated, and felt very Parisian. The bathroom was clean, with all the expected amenities for a short stay. (No probelms with hot water at all, despite having 2 showers and a bath some days!). The bed was comfortable and there was a mini bar with coffee making facilities. TV provided a range of French channels, BBC World and NBC in English. It was quiet, but our view was of the internal courtyard, not great but the location made up for it. The continental breakfast (buffet) included and was adequate, providing the usual mix of ham and cheese, croissants, rolls, fruit, yogurt and fruit juices. On the last day we were late to breakfast and they had run out of croissants. We asked the waiter for more and he went to the shop especially to pick up a fresh batch! The location is what really makes this hotel. On our first night there - it was late and we went for a little stroll to find something to eat. A 5 minute walk around a few corners and we had a magnificent view of The Eiffel Tower at night! This was totally unexpected - we never realised how close to it the hotel was. There was a charming little restaurant on the corner of this street with an amazing view of this great landmark. It was called \"Chez Francis\". The food here was of good quality and has a real French feel to it - Unlike many of the places on The Champs Elysees which we found to be over priced and very touristy. On the second night we went to a trendier place full of a younger crowd called Libresens. We decided to order cocktails; a black Russian and a Mojhito. The obviously experienced bar man suggested I tried something a little more exciting - he seemed to know what he was doing, so I agreed. He made probably one of the best cocktails I had ever tasted (a Gin MaiThai). My partner decided to stick with his very boozy black Russian. The food here was again good and this place had a really nice vibe about it. It was contemporary and was a welcomed break from Paris' sometimes stuffy and uptight surroundings. Everything was a stones throw away. In the space of 3 days we were able to visit The Eifflel Tower, The Arc de Triomphe, The Louvre, The Pompidou Centre and Montmartre. The Metro is one of the most time efficient ways for getting around and costs peanuts. Our hotel was a sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of Paris' busy streets. It exceeded our expectations in every way and is excellent value for money. A well priced boutique hotel that we would definitely recommend.

The hotel is located in a very elegant area with many boutiques near it and the avenue Champs Elysees only 10 minutes on foot. The rooms were spaceful and very clean. There was no problem with the heat and the bathroom had all the necessary equipment for a short stay. The most enjoyable of all was the privacy in the room as no noise existed. We really enjoyed our sleep as the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast was very tasteful and we found fresh products. The X-Mas decoration should have been more satisfied as no decoration existed besides the x-mas tree. The receptionists were very friendly and very helpful, especially the women... I recommned Chambiges Elysees because it is a hotel that provides all the necessary things that a guest expects by a 4 star hotel.
