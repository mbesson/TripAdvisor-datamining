The hotel is in the middle of nowhere and a good 30-40 min drive to the Tronchetto port where you catch the 20min water bus to Venice St Marco. Cosmos/group tour folks - if you are on a tight budget, save some money by avoiding other optionals/buying water at supermarkets instead of at the tourists sights but you MUST do the Venice optional night tour. If you don't , you are stuck in a highway motel - the Mira Poppi - with nothing to do but watch TV. Optional takes you into the city by night when it is quieter, no rush of tourists and is really quite romantic. They take you there by bus and then boat and same for coming back. We left at 6pm and reached venice by 7pm, then left at 11pm from Venice and came back by midnight. If you try and do it on your own it can be a big pain and even a tad scary cos of the location (very industrial) and unlike Rome no one speaks a word of English on the mainland(Tronchetto and Mira) - even cops won't be able to help you with directions if you can't speak Italian. They want to help but won't be able to, also Tronchetto is quite isolated (we spotted no one other than our group and another plus 1 sole person manning the vaporetto/waterbus stop ticket counter) so if you plan to do the evening thing on your own be sure your maps, money and knowledge of italian are in place!

Before we left the US, I read reviews on all the hotels that Cosmos booked for our trip. All were great except Hotel Poppi. I was very scared. I almost considered booking anther hotel while we were in Venice just to avoid Poppi. I am so glad that I didn't. The staff at Hotel Poppi was extrodinary. When we arrived (before we even got to our room) we asked for assistance finding a family in Chioggia that helped my parents adjust to Italy. The gentleman at the front desk pulled out a phone book and attempted to help me find my long lost family. I speak no Italian so finding an Italian family would be difficult for me to say the least. This gentleman at Hotel Poppi called several families to see if they were the one's I knew. We had no luck. I didn't figure that I would be able to find my family but I still wanted to find our apartment. Next up, getting to Chioggia. I was told there was a bus that traveled from Venice to Chioggia. Hotel Poppi sells tickets into Venice but not to Chioggia. The gentleman at the front desk said that he would find out where we could buy tickets and let us know. My husband and I went upstairs and less than 15 minutes later our room phone rang. We could get tickets just around the corner and the bus would be in front of the hotel in less than 10 minutes. We had to rush if we would make it in time. When we got downstairs, the man at the desk had his personal vehicle pulled up front to drive us to get tickets. He helped us buy them and then dropped us off at the bus stop. We missed the bus by 30 seconds. It was actually for the best. Just to finish off the story. We made it to Chioggia and found my old apartment. Oddly enough, my italian family still lived in the same apartment building. Remember I don't speak Italian. Missing the first bus paid off because a woman was entering the apartment building that spoke english and helped me find my long lost family. Other than my wedding day, this was the best moment in my life. I finally had the chance to meet my italian Grandmother, Aunts, Uncles, and Cousins. Without Hotel Poppi I am not sure that my dream would have come true. Thank you so much!!! Don't believe all the bad posts on this website. I will return to Italy and I will return to Hotel Poppi.

So i can't understand people saying location can be a trouble: for me not at all. We did eat 2nd night there and there was a nice buffet as well as buffet breakfast has been served in the morning. We found the room was clean and nice staff. We definetely loved that Hotel and we think has been one of the best we have been during the Tour.", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cHotel Staff are theives!! avoid at all cost! stay away! to far from Veince\u201d", "Author": "flowerbrdg", "ReviewID": "UR10826972", "Content": "The Hotel Poppi's staff are theives!!

If your tour group goes here find another hotel to stay in, or just don't go on this tour. First of all the hotel is in the middle of nowhere and far, i mean far from Vience and when the cleaning lady cleans the rooms she goes to every room on the floor and opens every door wide open while she cleans the other rooms. I actually forgot something one day so i had to go back to the hotel to get it and when i arrived there every room was open I could have walked in and out of multiple rooms and nobody would have known. Please, Please, please contact me with questions about this hotel I am so infuriated with this hotel that they actually stole my things and refuse to acknowledge it that I want everyone to know.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merseyside", "Title": "\u201c\"Goodnight and thank you!\"\u201d", "Author": "PeanutDotJU", "ReviewID": "UR8508154", "Content": "We spent our first night of an Archer's tour at the Hotel Poppi. As other reviewers have commented, the hotel was in an isolated location situated on a motorway. As we arrived on a Sunday afternoon, not even the supermarket on the adjacent complex was open. This meant that the only place we could obtain food and drink from was the hotel, giving it a monopoly and allowing them to charge extortionate prices. Due to the circumstances we had to rely on the hotel bar for lunch and this consisted of dry, unappetising sandwiches at 5 Euros each (when even in the centre of Venice we paid no more than 3!). To make matters worse, in the evening the bar was closed at 9.45 with \"Thank you and goodnight.\" As there was nothing else to do and it was afterall the first night of our holidays, we sat outside and chatted only to be eaten alive by mosquitos!! I'm sure we made a more tasty snack than the sandwiches!! Apart from the above, it is a modern hotel and the food served at the evening meal was acceptable.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cnothing wrong with the poppi just the whingers\u201d", "Author": "getaboutalotwales", "ReviewID": "UR8458753", "Content": "stayed at the \"poppi\" whilst on cosmos italian masterpiece tour.The poppi is a modern hotel along side a motorway to venice.It is true to say there is some traffic noise in the front of the hotel.I was concerned about stayed here having being put off by some of the petty whinging reviews.However,i found reception helpful friendly and efficient.Forty two of us arrived at the same time and were soon in our rooms our cases were delivered shortly after.I dined at the hotel and found the staff v/friendly and the food above average.Bar was excellent too.It was a 20minute local bus ride to venice (cheap too)and as venice is an island everyone has to get a boat to venice centre this is not anything to do with the poppi.The bus stop was next to the hotel.Would stay at the poppi anytime.", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, UK", "Title": "\u201cAlmost near Venice\u201d", "Author": "jaxxman", "ReviewID": "UR8452947", "Content": "A comfortable stay on tour, even if the room and bathroom were a little small.

The hotel is in the middle of nowhere. It could have been in Planet Pluto. While the location is bad enough, what was worse is the reception staff. You politely ask them where are the good restaurants located in San Marco and they tell you a coffee costs more than a day's wages from where you come from! Where does he think I come from? Can you believe this? I couldn't myself. A fellow Cosmos traveller heard the same words and he couldn't believe what he heard too. The dinner and breakfast in the hotel which was served to all the tour groups was like school canteen food or worse. So, if you are looking for 1. a hotel in no man's land 2. rude and condescending staff 3. lousy food, yep, you've found the right place to enjoy your Venetian Night.
