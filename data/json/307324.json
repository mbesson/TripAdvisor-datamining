Travelers on their initial visits to Japan will benefit from many signs being written in both Japanese and Englieh, not the case in many other areas of Japan. Shomben Yokocho (a small warren of old classic Japanese cookery and shopping) is near Shinjuku station as is Shinjuku Eastmouth high street shopping area and Kabukicho Red Light district. (For those of you well traveled, Kabukicho is not like an informative walk through the Amsterdam red-light district- it is seedy and overrun with agressive barkers and Central European and Asian street sex workers.) The hotel itself is clean, but could use a refresh. The rooms are nice, small as expected and seem locked in a mid-80s decor. There is a decent selection of restaruants (sushi bar is top notch and top dollar) and a liquor bar but don't confuse the liquor bar with anything exciting- it's a dim, leather padded haunt for business types and their wives/significant others. Take the walk or a taxi down to Times Square and find yourself a barstool or decent restaurant and watch japan go by, much more fun! The beds are comfortable (make sure to reserve non-smoking in advance if you want it, there are still a lot of smoking rooms in Japan) and the bathrooms are bright with lots of amenities and the usual deep Japanese bathtub.Departing from the airport the bus ride can be a walk outside to the bus and get on immediately 1.5 hour affair or, as in maddeningly typical, you just missed the last bus, wait 45 mins for another and then 2 hrs in traffic. The bus does take you door to door though. There is the train which is a predictable 90+ mins but you must change trains in Tokyo. If you have a lot of luggage go with the bus- trains can be very crowded after you get off the Narita-Tokyo express. Don't even think about a taxi- US 250-300.00 are the norm for this trip. Note: PLAN AHEAD for your trip back to Narita- reserve your train or bus ticket early and contemplate the possibility of 2hrs to get to Narita.", "Date": "Dec 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR873677133", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "kvf1"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel This hotel exceeded my expectations.

Like last time, we used points to upgrade to a club room, and really the Regency Club is the highlight of the hotel. The club is open to those staying in the Club rooms and consists of 3 or 4 interlinked lounges, all tastefuly decorated. They serve a generous breakfast, mostly continental style but also including some hot dishes, smoked salmon etc, and cocktails every evening between 6 and 8, with a really good range of drinks. It became a really pleasant start to the evening to sit in the lounge with a couple of drinks, overlooking the lights of Shinjuku, especially considering the prices in the hotel bar! Also worth knowing is that Hyatt Gold passport members get entry to the healthclub and pool free, otherwise like most Japanese hotels there is a hefty charge, around 2500 Yen!This a very pleasant hotel and the staff particularly are excellent, consistently polite, helpful and friendly. My only slight niggles are in the rooms themselves- even the club room we had is starting to look a little bit dated, as the room could be a little dark and the bathroom is nothing special.

I had a good stay there, the room was a good size, the food was good and the staff couldn't do enough for you. The hotel is situated in the business area of Shinjuku sandwiched between the government Building and several other tall buildings, and a small park. There is a complementary shuttle bus to Shinjuku station that operates every 20 minutes or you can walk there in about 10 minutes. In August I'd recommend the air-conditioned bus as it is so hot and sticky.Before my trip I registered with the Hyatt gold passport loyalty reward scheme, having done this and despite not having stayed in a Hyatt before I was put into a Hyatt gold passport room on check in. This membership also entitled me to free use of the pool and gym. The room I was in was very spacious for a Japanese hotel, I had a Super king size bed a couple of lounging chairs a small table and a desk to work at. There is also free Internet in the rooms. The bathroom was well equipped and had a shower adequate for my height, which I have struggled with in the past in East Asian hotels.The hotel is quite large and as such has several restaurants and a bar. The staff at the restaurants were always extremely welcoming and friendly. The breakfast buffet was of a high quality with a varied and plentiful choice of food.The main restaurant has great service; you could be in and out in 30minutes, which is great if you are eating on your own. I didn't feel rushed though. Hidden away under the building adjoined to the hotel is AM/PM convenience shop. This sells hot/cold snacks and beer if you don't fancy eating restaurant food again.

Great Hotel! One of the best and most convenient perks of this hotel was their shuttle service from Shinjuku Station which is one of if not the busiest station in Tokyo. You can pretty much get anywhere from this station. We did find it a little bit difficult to find the bus stop of the shuttle so here's a few tips; From Shinjuku station, make your way to Okakyu Department store which is on the West Exit. Once you exit, you'll see another department store called Keio across the road. You'll find the bus stop infront of the street level entrance. The shuttle to the hotel leaves Shinjuku station every 20mins (10, 30, 50 every hour up from 8:10am - 9:50pm). Make sure you're on time!!

Check in was relatively smooth and friendly. I was even upgraded from a standard King room to a View King. The rooms are indeed a bit dated and do need renovation. I would assume the Hyatt group/management do realize this already. The room feels like it's right out of the Eighties...although the complimentary Internet in the View King rooms are a nice touch (at last-free internet in the room). The lobby itself is quite a large space and the check in counters, concierge counter, cashier, and so forth do remind me of some Hyatt properties that go for a smooth but simple elegance. I would however say that the elevators seriously need some maintenance. I did want to try their rooftop pool at their Health Club called Joule but unfortunately had little time in Tokyo.I had dinner at omborato on the third floor. No special design or theme in the restaurant but the service and food was fairly average for 5,000 yen in a hotel.Overall, I can't fault the Hyatt too much - but I can't say that it was a great stay. I picked this property because I was expecting a modern Hyatt property. Another reason why I picked this property was because for 26,000 yen - it was a fairly affordable sum for one night. The Grand Hyatt and the Park Hyatt is at least double that amount.

I complained at check out, and although sincere with their apologies, stating they are working on the air conditioning, no rebate or consideration was given.

This is a very good 4-star hotel, and pretty good value for Tokyo. Don't be put off by how ugly it looks from outside. Inside, it's very early-80s in style with enormous chandeliers and marble floors, but it's been very well maintained, and the guest rooms are stylish enough. The guest rooms are a decent size, and very clean, but the bathrooms are a little old fashioned. We found the mattresses very comfortable. We stayed in one of the Regency Club rooms on the 6th floor. This gives you access to the lounge on the 9th floor, which serves tea/snacks all day long, cocktails in the evening and quite a good continental breakfast in the mornings. I tihnk it is actually worth paying a bit extra for the lounge - it's well staffed, unlike some other hotel lounges, and it's quite relaxing.The pool, on the top floor, is great. It's not very big, but then not many people seem to use it. Lovely views. The gym is small - a few treadmills and two cross-trainers, and then a couple of resistance machines and only 40kg of free weights. But it's fine for a hotel gym. Staff were very polite and generally helpful. The gym staff seemed a bit dozy, but on the whole, the service is very good. The hotel is very well located - it is only 5 minutes walk from Shinjuku station, despite what some others have said. All you need to do it take one of the West exits from Shinjuku station and it should be pretty obvious - there are signposts to the High Rise/Skyscraper district everywhere. It's also good because the hotel is one that the airport bus calls at. This is by far the most convenient way to get here from the airport - don't bother with the train.

If I was rating this hotel on service it would receive 5 stars. 2. The rooms are fairly large (typical US hotel size)3. If you join the Hyatt Gold Passport club, you will get free access to the pool as well as a free semi-continental breakfast each morning.4. We are happy with the location.5. Some US TV channels. Bad:1. The rooms have no individual climate control. Our room is so hot that we can never look out the window because it is wet with condensation. When we asked about this we learned that the hotel has central climate control and right now that control is set on heat. This means if I set the thermometer in my room to 68 degree air conditioning, I get hot air. They suggested we turn it off and they brought us a fan.2. The beds are very hardIt looks like the good outweighs the bad, but what I value in a hotel room is simply a good night's sleep (couldn't care less about status or quality of the food, etc).

This is my second time to stay at this hotel. I stayed 5 nights in Century Hyatt from 1 Jan. The reasons I booked this hotel were - No rooms available in Shinjuku during New Year - My husband is the Gold Passport Member - His company has an attractive corporate rate (17500 yen plus 13% per night)I contact their world-wide reservation hotline to book the room directly. They are so helpful and professional. The operator sent the message to the hotel to reconfirm the rate, especially on the 1st of Jan (most of the 5 star hotels would charge a ad-hot rate on 31 Dec and 1 Jan) and put us on the waiting list on 1 Jan. When I called them next day, everything was confirmed.Staffs of reception and concierge are excellent and I could not pick any mistakes from their services.  We stayed at the room of Gold Passport Level and had a pretty good view. Bathroom was refurbished, clean and neat. HOWEVER, we found some problems in the room :-Temperature of room is HOT AND DRY. I tried to adjust and temperature to 19 Degree (and of course it was not actural 19 Degree !), and put a large and wet bath towel on the cabinet every night when we're back , but it did not help! - Mattress was a nightmare ! We thought we were sleeping on a tight and hard steeling web - it killed our backs! It was not a proper mattress at all. We hesisted to request to change the room as we thought they were the same quality of beds. Hotel is not at the centre of Shinjuku, so if you're planning to have a crazy shopping especially during early Jan and early July (Semiannual Sale in Japan), you need to carry all your shopping bags, walk from the station to hotel for about 10 to 15 min at least, or take a shuttle bus at the front Odakyu Dept Store (Annex Building) (fortunately it has some space for the luggage but you need to queue up and wait it for every 20 min). The only concern of both ways back to hotel is about the weather - freezing in Winter and metting in Summer. For the Gold Passport Member of Hyatt Group, the hotel provides a breakfast room with pastry, coffee or tea.

Our son was able to make run around for his daily morning exercise. ;-) The bathroom is well stock w toiletries (like any 5-star hotels), clean and relatively spacious too. But the real reason why we gave it a five star is because of its service. We needed to get diapers for our son and the hotel staff went out of their way to locate it for us. Also, the concierge was helpful and able to provide us with very useful information, i.e the fastest route to a tourist attraction, opening hours, where to purchase the entrance tickets. Every morning, before we set off, we'll head to the concierge for all the information we needed to plan and get to our attractions of the day.

When we arrived, we found the hotel to be striking (the lobby chandeliers are RIDICULOUS!), the staff friendly and able to speak the needed English (as did most people in Tokyo, it seems), and the rooms clean, comfy, and welcoming. We stayed here a week and then, after going to Kyoto for a week, stayed here the night prior to our flight out of Narita. The first time we sprung for the View room, but the second time we didn't. Both rooms had great views and were equally sizable. While the hotel has a shuttle to and from Shinjuku Station, we never took it; it only takes about 5 or so minutes on foot, so we saw no need. A word to the wise: It took us a few days to realize that there was a subway station significantly closer to us than Shinjuku. When returning to the hotel, transfer at Shinjuku for the Oedo Line, going one stop to Tocho-mae. Since the Japanese trains are like clockwork, it'll only add like 3 minutes to the trip (which you save by having to walk less than a minute to the hotel).
