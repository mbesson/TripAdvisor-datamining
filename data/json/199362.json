The hotel is quite convenient for the airport (Tegel), is near an underground station and the Opera. Parking is available if required. My room was large enough for a night and was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was good by the standard of smallish hotels, including bacon, egg and sausages and fruit as well as te usual muesli and rolls. The staff are friendly. As in many German hotels the wireless internet is not free but that doesn't bother me as I have my own connection. The underground runs beneath the hotel and I heard the rumbling even though I was on the fourth floor. This doesn't bother me either but it may disturb some people. All in all, excellent value for money (68 EUR including breakfast) and I shall be going there again.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Strongsville, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWonderful location for moderate price\u201d", "Author": "maestrolms", "ReviewID": "UR52179911", "Content": "This medium-sized hotel is located very near the Deutches Oper house, and right across from a convenient U-Bahn (subway) station. The large Zoologischer Garten station, with U-Bahn, S-Bahn (commuter rail) and surface bus terminals, is only two stops away, and offers a convenient location to start an exploration of the whole city Berlin public transport is very extensive, and cheap if you purchase multi-day tickets. My single room was rather small, but completely adequate. Since it was on the top (6th) floor, it was far enough from the street to minimize the traffic noise. The bathroom was small but very modern and clean. The reception staff were very helpful and courteous, especially Hanne, who was in charge during the day. My original plan was to stay for six nights, but they were having problems with their Internet supplier, and could only offer me the use of a computer in the lobby, so I chose to move after three nights to another hotel which offered free WiFi. I did not have breakfast at the hotel, but it looked pretty complete, but cost 14 Euros. There was a wonderful small supermarket only a block away, so I was able to stock up and save. There are several restaurants nearby. The location of the hotel made it a wonderful value for me, and the price was very reasonable.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Garndolbenmaen", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "cofi59", "ReviewID": "UR21687923", "Content": "A lovely hotel. Easy to find using the excellent underground system. The exit from the station was just outside the main doors of the hotel.

There was a great supermarket within 100 yards which was great for snacks and wine etc. We went on a fantastic walking tour with INSIDER TOURS with Mark from New Zealand who was a fantastic knowledgeable guide.

We found that if we had a sumptuous breakfast, some snacks through the day kept us going till dinner. There are a couple of restaurants near the hotel but they are a bit pricey.

I wanted a clean and relatively inexpensive hotel within easy reach of Berlin's excellent public transit system. That's what this hotel offers. Hotel an der Oper is not glitzy - but I didn't want to pay for glitz. I simply wanted a decent room in which to leave my things and to sleep at night. The U-Bahn stop is located at the other end of the block - a two minute walk away. ( You can purchase your ticket at the hotel's front desk.) From here you'll be at any major point of interest within a short time. My room was adequately comfortable. The breakfast buffet was comparable to most other German hotels.

Their lift was out of order so they decided to book us into a room on the 6th floor because according to both receptionists (and I PERFECTLY understood their little 'joke' when they spoke in German) \"he (my boyfriend) ist eine grose\" ('he is so fat) followed by something resembling 'he could do with the excersise'. If I hadnt been so tired I would've reciprocated in a less humourous manner (and Im being kind here cos I want this to be published). We stayed 5 nights but only had cleaning twice but we didnt complain. That is until on our final night we were publicly approached as we passed reception and were loudly tolt off that we were to be charged \u20ac60 for 'soiling' the bed. Yes, really. When she explained this in detail she described how \"sometimes when a man wants to love a woman that these things happen.\" \"I personally check every room every day\" she said. Well if she did then why hadnt our 4-day-old room not been cleaned? Almost an hour went by of her contradicting herself and in the end we gave up - you just wouldnt get anywhere with her. Then she said she wouldnt charge but that remains to be seen on next months credit card bill. So basically, if you have any hormones in your body, if you have a PULSE, dont stay here unless you're a member of TrueLoveWaits. Even then you really COULDNT wait unless you ask for the 3 pricey porno channels to be disconnected... Besides all, we took one look at breakfast and ran - olives and pate, anyone? No reception 'area' to hang out in, no bar (and the mini bar in room is EXTORTION and if you try find even the same water to replace locally you wont), my guess is that she really checks the rooms to see whats been drank so the bill goes 'ching'. The area feels very isolated - a two mile long road with nothing apart from dodgy (and I MEAN DODGY) cafes, rug shops, estate agents and car dealers. No views, nothing, only the sound of the underground...even 6 floors up. The beds were two singles pushed together, so I dont know how she thought we got 'up to' anything, what with the grand canyon forming the great divide between us hahahaha! Id originally booked a place on Kurfurstendamm and when we passed it one night I was nearly in tears - it has everything going for it, even the Hard Rock Cafe.
