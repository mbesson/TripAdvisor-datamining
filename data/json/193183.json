The bathroom was barely large enough to shower in, the bed covers appeared to be soiled and when attempting to sleep all we heard was an irate neighbour yelling for about 4 hours during the night.

The bathroom was disgusting. The floor tiles were pretty filthy and streaked black around the toilet and the shower was hideous. Strange clumps of miscellaneous grot clung to the edges of the shower tray. The plug was blocked and didn't even pretend to drain, at all. However, the TV worked fine and the window opened. The electronic lock worked first time on the door (amazing!) and there was tea and coffee in the room.

They told me that it \"very much depends on the customer\" and clearly considered me to be out of order for not simply paying twice. After I pointed out that I actually live in the area and would not be on the next plane to somewhere far away like the majority of their guests, they finally calmed down enough to let me check in. They have me Room 101. Literally. The room was DISGUSTING. It was tiny and smelled like something had died under the bed.

Firstly the room we stayed which should of been for my self and 2 children was smaller than my box room you literally had to climb over the bed to move, this is where i booked also for my baby although there was no cot and no room for a cot when i asked reception about this there answer was well we never charged you for the baby!!!! although it did cost us \u00c2\u00a3400 for 2 nights i also asked for my room to be changed as i was not happy in fact i felt like crying as it felt like i had walked back into the 80s not only that it was filthy and you had to shut the bathroom door to be able to move in the bathroom which was like a cupboard!!!! they said they could not change the room and could not reimburse our money, so my dad furious at this point asked to see the manager to be told he would not be in till monday our day of departure, had my daughter not been with us we would of left but she was so excited to see the sights of london we stayed, all i can say is i am still itching 4 days later from sleeping in the beds, the breakfast was the worst breakfast i have ever tasted all warmed straight from the fridge so on the second day we went out for breakfast!!!

Door room card key took four attempts with me running up and down the stairs to get it re-coded. Finally the receptionist had to come up and use another card. Rooms very small (small for even London standards) Generally maintance and cleanliness very poor. Random items left on stairs, Doors propped open with fire extinguishers. Room condition just as bad. Toilet bowl stained water did not drain out of sink, shower head provided but no where to hang it on the wall. Water pressue very low so I doubt shower would have worked anyway. Bed mattress very used and bumpy and not sure if any creppy crawley in the bed as well so tried to sleep on top of the covers. Personally on the night I stayed found outside noise interupted sleep which ended up being approx 2 hrs as hotel noise started 5.30 am A College of mine was in another room which he had to move ot of during the night as he heard something scratching under the bed.

It is just 100m from Paddington station on the Circle line which can take you to all the sights in London and there is also the first bus stop of many bus lines so you are the only passenger on the stop and you can take a place right in front of the upper window and have a sightseening tour nearly for free. Yes, it is a little bit noisy place because the hotel stands on the crossroad and above the tube line (so you can hear it while passing under :) but it is not so bed. I think it is a good offer for that money. And if you just want to have a bed and breakfast it is a great place to stay over night.
