This is a fantastic place to stay. The rooms are comfortable, nicely appointed and very clean. The staff at check in made me feel welcomed are was pleasant everytime I spoke to them. The common areas of this hotel are very clean also. Several places nearby to eat dinner in the area.

I usually have great luck with the Candleood chain. Irving, TX and Temple, TX are awesome, but this one in Memphis made me think I was in an old Holiday Inn. First off, the room was filthy when I got there, and it had been cleaned...! Food drippings from a spoon were all over the stove/cooktop. The fake wood floor had not even been swept, let alone mopped. Pieces of food and paper scraps all along the edge of the kitchen floor.. The carpet had not been vaccumed. The back door of the building had a place for your keycard, but the door was never locked the entire time I was there..! Some security.!!! The keys quit working before 10 AM the second day, and I still had another night to go. The refrigerator had not been wiped out or sterilized.....something sticky and red was on one of thw wire shelves. The ice cube dispenser was full of ice cubes...usually at all hotels the ice catcher is emptied after each guest. 3 or 4 large bags of trash sat by the trash can by the elevator ALL weekend. I met a man in the hallway by the fitness room and he did not even say \"Good Morning\" on Monday morning...I found out he was the manager....!!! I guess it's time to head back to the Residence Inn chain...where I'm not afraid to walk across the floor barefoot.....", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lunenburg, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cNEVER stay there again, poor desk clerk.\u201d", "Author": "rte2mittons", "ReviewID": "UR70621755", "Content": "We reserved 5 rooms for our family reunion/vacation. Talked in LENGTH when booked them to make sure we could ALL be on the same floor. Was disappointed because they did not have the 1 bedroom suites with the couch that pulls out in the livingroom, but ALWAYS had good experiences @ other Candlewood Suites, so decided to stay anyways. Hotel clerk, ASHLEY, was an IDIOT, had NO CLUE AT ALL what was going on at any time & on the 3rd when we checked in the manager WAS NOT HELPFUL & SLIGHTLY RUDE too!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED in our experience there. We'd ask simple questions such as about the local fireworks & ASHLEY had NO clue. Not to mention they had to move 1 set of our family 3 times!!!! Each room that was given to them was DIRTY & not even done up yet. Mind you too, that 1st set of family members did not arrive until 6:30p.m!!! The floor was dirty in our room too & the other family members complained too. Also both mornings our breakfast selections in EVERY room was messed up 1 way or another. I will NEVER stay @ this place again & I WILL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW, NOT TO STAY HERE EITHER IN MEMPHIS!!!!", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hot springs village", "Title": "\u201cMostly a great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "marcia2465", "ReviewID": "UR67419207", "Content": "This is an extended stay hotel, so no daily housekeeping. They could do a better job of keeping the common areas clean. The room was very clean, however. One thing I didn't like is no lamp on one side of the bed so both people could not read in bed. A little crowded for an extended stay but we were there for four nights and it was OK. Bathroom is roomy but bedroom a little small. The best thing was the continental breakfast brought to your door at the time you select. Much better than the traditional continental breakfast in the lobby.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value- Great Stay!\u201d", "Author": "poofbear", "ReviewID": "UR65681190", "Content": "Very nice hotel at a very reasonable price!

The room had a full kitchen and a huge bathroom, Really COMFY BED, a flatscreen TV , Free internet and phone, Free breakfast SERVED IN YOUR ROOM WHEN YOU WANT IT !!!!! Free LAUNDRY area,Free OUTDOOR GRILL, FREE COFFEE ANYTIME with your own coffee maker. This hotel is LOCATED IN HEART OF EVERYTHING!! from FedEx world headquarters across the street.to Southwind Golf complex across the street, walking distance to anything you want from Target and shopping to any resturant you can think of, this is great my we needed cold medication and umbrellas to snacks a minute away. Even if you need your car serviced . the area is really safe and clean. It is located to all major highways. I almost cried when i had to leave.

I arrived at night and felt perfectly safe. It was in a nice area, although a little difficult to find. My GPS did find it pretty easily, though. The price I paid was well worth the time it took to find it. In the morning, I realized that it was located near some very nice homes, restaurants and shopping areas. The front desk at check in was sufficient. They have a business center with computers/fax machine and free wifi. They have a \"Candlewood Cupboard\" which is basically like a little convenience store stocked with convenience items, candy, drinks and microwaveable foods which is open late. We found it to be well stocked and moderately priced. My children loved it and I was thrilled that I didn't have to order greasy pizza or go out again. They did have fruit, cheese and some other relatively healthy options as well. Our room was on the third floor and was very clean and well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable and had very nice linens. It had a good sized flat screen tv and a small efficiency type kitchen. I'm not sure if our room was handicapped accessible or if all the rooms are this way, but the doors were very large and the entrance to the bathroom very spacious. It was a nice feature for bringing a luggage cart in and out. The room was a one queen studio and was quite spacious all around. There was a reclining chair that my 6 year old slept in. She said it was quite comfortable! I found the hotel to be very quiet, however I suspect that the hotel was at low occupancy the night I was there (on a Monday night) and it did seem that the walls were quite thin. I think if the hotel were full it might be very loud. I was very paranoid that my energetic kids were keeping some weary business traveler awake! All in All this hotel was great and we are staying there again on our way home. This hotel is obviously set up to cater particularly to the long term guest and business traveler, but we found it to be very accomodating to a family with young children and a pet for a one night stay. Upon check out I was very impressed with the level of service. The maintenance manager as well as general manager were at the front desk and both wished us well and welcomed us back again. The front desk clerk was also great.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Candlewood Suites Memphis", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55197-d1138079-Reviews-Candlewood_Suites_Memphis-Memphis_Tennessee.html", "Price": "$81 - $99*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7950 Centennial Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Memphis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">38125</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1138079", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ae/11/ae11cde50f9511a2346061906bdb756a7large.jpg"}}
