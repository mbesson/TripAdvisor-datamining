The house is a renovated Ottoman-era residence, and there are only ten rooms (the owner lives in the house). I liked the location, but I would not go there for a first visit to Istanbul. Kurucesme is an upscale part of the city (the Ferrari garage is across the street of the hotel), with very few foreign tourists, a lovely view of the Bosphorus, some good fish restaurants and private yachts moored in front of a small park. It is far from Sultanahmet, but it is a good base to visit the villages along the Bosphorus, and it is a few bus stops away from the Dolmabahce Palace, Yildiz Park, Istanbul Modern and the boat to the Princes' Islands. The rooms are all very large and very comfortable (first time I have had music in the toilet!). The 'garden' is small and close to a road, so I recommend a room with full Bosphorus view or 'garden' / Bosphorus view (room 101). The rooms are serviced from a desk on the first floor, and this works well (I loved the huge basket with fresh fruit and the platter with dried fruit after checking in). The Caudalie Spa is one of the best city spas I have seen, and the staff there is also excellent. The spa is open to outsiders (members, day pass), and the staff in the fitness area did not speak much English. I had a very good massage in the traditional hammam. The major weaknesses of the hotel are the restaurant and noisy events. Because the restaurant is used for events, it does not really function for the hotel guests at many times. The same is true for the bar next to the restaurant. The waiting staff do not speak English and seem only concerned with the events, not with the hotel guests. Breakfast was a disaster: slow and unprofessional service, very basic Turkish-style breakfast. There was a party one day with loud music until midnight. When you pay about 1000 euro per night, all this is a major disappointment. Despite this, and the fact that the rates are crazy by Turkish standards, Les Ottomans is a special treat if you want to experience Istanbul in a private palace on the Bosphorus.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Casablanca, Morocco", "Title": "\u201cThanks for making our stay special...\u201d", "Author": "boutchou72", "ReviewID": "UR80294119", "Content": "Hotel les Ottomans is a fantastic place to stay in Istanbul.

Seriously funny. If it didn't cost so much you would actually be in stitches laughing at just how absurd it it. The entrance foyer is just lined with photographs of the owner fresh from an Essex spray tanning salon with every Turkish soap opera star imaginable. The place is so self-indulgent by the owner it made me feel like I was at a car crash with Planet Holywood and the Michael Jackson Estate. We ate dinner in the restaurant. I ordered tenderloin with foie gras and potato gratin. It came as an incinerated piece of steak, french fries and without the foie gras. That was 77TL. I asked for the menu from 4 waiters to check that the menu description was accurate and I hadn't ordered the petrol station special. I was right. When I questioned it, the waiter said it was perfect and pointed at the french fries and said \"potato\" and then waved at the steak and said \"fois gras on top\". Needless to say, I said \"rubbish\" and sent it back. All of a sudden my meal was returned to me with a whole foie on top .... bone cold. And, let's just say there was nothing tender about the tenderloin. The hotel website indicates it is close to Old Town, Topkapi Palace, Sultanahmet and Hagia Sophia. I am sure it is not far by super-charged jet boat, but with a driver you're looking at an hour each way. Please, please, please ... just go there as it should be on the tourist map as somewhere truly comical. Don't stay or eat, maybe just a gin and tonic on the terrace ... but go. TOO FUNNY.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Old Greenwich, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing....\u201d", "Author": "cocochest", "ReviewID": "UR64847230", "Content": "If you're traveling to Istanbul to visit the City this is NOT the place you want to stay unless you're prepared to spend almost an hour, each way, each day to get to the \"Old City\"/Sultanahment area. We just returned from a four day stay and to say we were disappointed is a bit of an understatement. The hotel itself is situated right on the Bosphorus near the towns of Ortakoy and Bebek which are the hip and happening, young, rich Eurostyle set. Fancy cars, fancy boats and expensive restaurants. If you didn't know you were in Turkey you could have easily guess the French of Italian Riviera. EVERYWHERE you go you have to take a taxi unless you use the uber-expensive VIP service which comes with a Bentley, driver and \"attendant\" with an earpiece looking like he's taking care of someone very important. A bit too \"over the top\" for us! Rooms are very large HOWEVER do not stay in a room with a \"garden\" view. There is no garden you're viewing..you're overlooking the entrance of the hotel which is about 50 feet away from the very busy road which you'll hear ALL night long. Lots of fancy accoutrements in the rooms - electronic shades, electronic temperature, TV, etc. We could not get the overhead rain shower to work until the last day of the stay because communications were a bit difficult. So...we settled for the Waterpik-like portable unadjustable shower stick that managed to hit you directly in the back of the neck. The service was very helpful but the English was quite spotty so oftentimes it took 2-3 different people before we could get someone to help us. It appeared to be an \"events\" type hotel and not one at all used to helping people that are there to sightsee and visit the town. The hotel only has 10 rooms and we were the only non-business types there. It felt like it was closed down and the place was a summer, on the Bosphorus hot-spot - the pool wasn't open and the sitting areas outside weren't really open. We didn't eat there because we don't really like eating in a place where we'd be the only ones dining. We did have breakfast one morning and it was quite good but took a long time to arrive. The one room service breakfast came 25 minutes after the time we requested it. All in all...for US$900 a night this was totally not worth the money....location left a LOT to be desired and we felt like we were the people that showed up at a party...uninvited.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cincredible hotel that creates a magical experience for guests\u201d", "Author": "lt17", "ReviewID": "UR10078011", "Content": "staying at this hotel is so amazing that you will not want to leave to explore the rest of istanbul! expect champagne and canapes upon arrival with a staff who caters to your every need and whim - each room has a remote which is used to control the tv, the ac, the black out curtains, the windows and the lighting - the rooms are very tastefully decorated with very rich and lavish colors - the spa is of the most highest quality, with a beautiful turkish hamman and indoor and outdoor pools - the spa even has a shower with lights and aromatheraphy to replicate being in a rain forest, a thunder storm and a mountain setting! each morning a breakfast is delivered to your room at your requested time with the freshest ingredients - the service, the food, the room and the staff all come together to make this boutique hotel experience a truly magical one!", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cThe ultimate luxury experience\u201d", "Author": "Dollitas", "ReviewID": "UR7487670", "Content": "This place is magic!

Champagne' caviar served in our room, the bar, breakfast and the spa was included in the room rate! Our room was a beautiful suite viewing the Bosphorus, MAGICAL!!! The 2400 m2 Caudalie Spa is unique, the massages so delightful, the service uncomparable. We were supposed to stay 2 nights but we extended 3 more nights: Dining at Les Ottomans is incredible, their Australian Executive Chef offers a delicious international Menu but you may also try the Ottoman Menu to discover the amazing Ottoman and turkish cuisine!!!! As a Jazz music 'connaisseur' we spend our evening's at the Q Jazz Club' the New-Yorker singer Hazel Paige showed amazing performances every nights...
