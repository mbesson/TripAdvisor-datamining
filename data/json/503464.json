First was in March in the Suite room and the second stay was a month or two after in the studio. One of the many reasons why I chose to stay here for the 2nd time was because of my daughter of 5 y/0. She was happy and contented, feeling at home as we can bring take away from any restaurant nearby and eat in as if we were at home and she could play to her delight. She loved going down to toast her bread in the morning as breakfast is served at the lobby, family style. Jia was inviting due to the location (nearby restaurants and shopping - SOGO, and many other shops were a stone's throw away) and cozy touch. Although the rooms were good, we find it a bit too dark and the bathrooms were too crowded. Although bed is comfortable, it is too small. The concept of having free flowing breakfast, fruits, snack and drinks is great and enticing. Since it is located in the busy area of CWB, naturally there was no view from the window which is understandable. Although staff looked nice, they were not the typical very warm and friendly type unless you start a conversation running perhaps. They are not bashful but just ok and efficient. I've recommend this hotel to my friends and would not hesitate to come back if the price is right.

The room included a kitchenette, lounge and dining area and there was ample space for the three of us. It was more like an apartment than a hotel room.

I stayed at the Jia earlier this year - when it was still the Jia - and still remember it very clearly. Just as the name suggests (Jia is home in Mandarin) the rooms are more like your downtown pied-a-terre than a faceless hotel. It isn't the easiest place to find - as the external signage is very subtle - but the location is great - just minutes walk from the shops and metro at Causeway bay, and even better, just across the road from the fabulous Din Tai Fung dumpling restaurant. The rooms are a little bigger than usual hotel rooms, and ours had a small living room area and kitchen. Yes the sofa cushions could have done with a wash and yes the blinds in the shower were past their best, but it felt comfortable - a pleasant place to retreat from the frenetic energy of downtown HK. It also felt quite cosy - somewhere that deviated from the blandness of so many hotels. What contributed to the relaxed feel was the laid back lobby area where wine was available for guests to help themselves for much of the day. Breakfast worked on the same principle - you just help yourself to the coffee, rolls, fruit etc in the small kitchen.

On both visits I was on my own and travelling for pleasure. On the positive side, the Jia is nicely located in Causeway Bay, near both trams and trains (though taxis are soooo inexpensive in HK, I only occasionally used either). The rooms are very comfortable and have many useful amenities: iPod dock, dvd players (with movies at reception), kitchenette, separate lounge space. The decor is fairly classic Philippe Starck with clean lines, troll stools and lots of white and silver (with a touch of yellow). When the hotel first opened, I'm sure the rooms were stunning and an excellent value. There is a nice terrace (with laundry facilities), a pleasant bar, and a restaurant on site. As a single woman, I felt perfectly safe at all times both in the hotel and in the surrounding neighborhood. So far so good. On the less positive side, the problem with minimalist, clean, white rooms is it takes a lot of effort to keep them looking so pristine, and the Jia is definitely now showing a fair amount of wear and tear. In the 18 months since I last visited, the hotel and my room definitely looked a bit less fresh. Secondly, there are only two small lifts servicing the whole hotel, and I found at certain peak periods the wait to get up/down was frustratingly long (especially when the lift would just pass your floor altogether without stopping). Finally, the breakfast is fine but uninspiring. Everything is laid out nicely enough in the lobby, but it does seem a bit crowded at times (you can end up eating your food in your lap), and the food on offer is fairly pedestrian i.e. muffins, yoghurt, juice and coffee. The queue for the coffee maker was also a bit trying at times. Would I return again? Maybe. I like the rooms, and if I were assured of getting one that didn't look too worn and could get a good price, I would visit again. But for the price I paid on the last visit, I'm not sure the value proposition is quite as good as it used to be (higher price for more worn hotel). Still, all in all, a good boutique-y hotel experience. Just work to get a good price on the room so as to get your money's worth.

The taxi driver was typically grouchy and was nagging bout us having to stop at the side of the road opposite the hotel etc, but beneath all that he came down (still nagging) took out 2 strollers, crossed the st and helped us! Reception staff were great throughout, courteous and informative. The room size is definitely a plus, similar to buying a one room studios apartment,a small kitchen area, a big work desk with lots of sockets, a sofa, a daybed in the hall,and a little hidden corner with another daybed( where I positioned the baby cot and slept with the baby) and a proper dining table for 4. And then there is the room with a queen sized bed. Lots of closet area. Decently cleaned rooms everyday, replenishment of amentities were excellent. A little complain though..the shower does need some tweaking.head was very small and you do have to do some jumping jacks when the water turns hot and cold at its own will. My baby wasn't trilled, he was screaming at bath time at all times even though I brought an inflatable tub for him. I would also say the lightning is pretty dim, romantic for couples but maybe a little dark for children who may find it too \"moody\". But it wasn't a major thing, my 4year old loves it with or without the lights. The space was great for her. We were fortunate enough to get a room which other reviewers have experienced (dirty linen, dirty walls,etc) ours was well maintained and we left we made sure it looked the same. The mini bar at the lobby was great with bottled water,juices and coffee available all day and cakes at certain hrs.breakfast was great for us, fresh fruits and pastries and breads. Always fresh. Laundry service on the rooftop area is great. Was surprised its free. With detergent and softener provided. That you very much JIa, that is great service and it didn't cost an arm or leg at all. My daughter wanted my husband to buy one room from JIa to make it her holiday home.Ha! Traffic noise can be pretty loud if you have a sleeping baby, it is in the midst of the city..especially on weekends when drivers get impatient and vent their frustrations with the honk. We were staying on the 22 floor, there are 23 floors. But you can't beat the noise youngest from places like new York where you hear sirens every few minutes, it eventually becomes part of the room.. So it was ok. Food and shopping is not a problem at all. Great DIn Tai FUng is just across the streets andnlotsbof little shops for local food. Small night market just next to the hotel. Lazy to go out? Just order a takeout. Easy. All in all, it was a great place for us, to stay, to relax and even to play. And yes we will come back again.

Overall, it was a wonderful room, location, and value, and I would definitely stay again on a future trip to Hong Kong. ROOM: We booked a suite, since we had a long stay and wanted space to work and relax. The suite was perfect for two. It's laid out like an apartment and feels very spacious, with the added benefit of Philippe Starck decor. There is a huge living space with a desk, comfortable living room, and even a full dining set and kitchenette. There's tons of closet space, too, and a clean, comfortable bedroom. If you have a long stay, it's nice to be able to relax in your room, keep breakfast in the kitchen, order delivery and watch a movie, etc. BATHROOM: The bathroom was a Westernized bathroom, all white marble with a glass-enclosed shower (no tub). There's a decent amount of storage space in the medicine cabinet and on the sink, though only one person can fit in the bathroom at a time. Also, the hot water was very limited, but wasn't a major problem. HOUSEKEEPING/STAFF: The housekeeping did a good job. The bathroom was clean enough, but could have used a bleach job, and we had to pile the towels up outside the bathroom to get them replaced every day, but I had no real complaints. The laundry prices were reasonable and they did a fine job. The staff was friendly and helpful with getting us a taxi to the airport. AMENITIES: The Jia offers a great free \"mini bar\" in the hotel lobby, with soft drinks, coffee, tea, and water bottles available all day/night, as well as continental breakfast, a tea-time snack, and evening wine. We usually missed breakfast, but the spread included fresh fruit and pastries. The hotel has an on-site fitness room, which is small but has all you need. LOCATION: If you want to be on Hong Kong island, the location cannot be beat. It's two blocks from the Causeway Bay subway stop, and you can always get a taxi nearby. If you like to walk, you can walk almost anywhere, from the Mid-Levels and Hollywood Road, to Pacific Place in Admiralty, to the Convention Center in Wan Chai. There are a lot of great dining and shopping options close by in Times Square, too. VALUE: Overall, it's excellent value for Hong Kong, where hotels can be small and expensive.

On subsequent days, I asked about certain meeting locations as I wanted to take a taxi and sometimes, the staff would offer to help hail a taxi, but sometimes they just said \"go in this direction etc\". This was an issue as JIA was located at the cross-junction of two narrow and busy streets, and it was extremely to get a taxi on your own, if a staff didn't get one of you. The hotel is about 15mins walk both from Times Square and Sogo. And there are many food places along Jardine's Bazaar, which is diagonally across the hotel. I went there for local breakfast everyday, as the continental breakfast in the hotel was kinda limited. There is also a Din Tai Fung Chinese restaurant right beside the hotel, if you are too lazy to walk around for dinner. The room is quirkly and funky, as you would expect from a Starck design.

One two slice toaster and one coffee machine serving tens of guests. And oh yes - we ate on the lobby floor because there aren't enough seats. I reckon Mr Stark would be having kittens at the impracticality of it all. By the time I'd got a bit of toast cooked the breakfast \"service\" was shut down. I expressed my disgust to the manager who said she's never heard of problems with room smells before (Strange - I've just read a similar complaint here on tripadvisor) She took $400Hk off the room cost but we were still charged tax on the original $1795.

Yes the rooms are compact, but they are cleverly laid out. This is Asia, where floor space is at a premium. If you want a bigger room, that's a worry. Hong Kong is such an amazing place you should not want to sit in your room! The bed was heavenly comfortable (that might also have something to do with my beautiful companion!), the home theatre system was a nice touch and the toiletries (which are constantly replenished) luxurious. The friendly staff were always there to help navigate around the city, suggest and book restaurants (note, Hutong at 1 Peking Road for incredible views and authentic top class Chinese, Dragon-I for the best in stylish clubbing and Top Deck at Jumbo for the best sundowner in town). The hotel is undoubtedly situated in the best part of the city; right in the middle of Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island and 3 mins walk to the MTR. There are amazing local eateries on the strip to the underground and lots of boutique style shopping around the side streets. Make time for G.O.D and certainly have brunch in their cafe next door (Habitu), when you need a change from noodles and dim sum. Jia is home from home but also cool enough to feel like you are staying somewhere special.

As good as I have had in any tapas bar around the world!! - Sometimes the breakfast area at the hotel is quite busy and taking things back to your room is tricky.

There's a lot to like about this small (50-some studio and suite apartments) boutique hotel, and if you're an independent traveler seeking style, comfort, and value in an HK hotel, I highly recommend the Jia. Hotel: Jia occupies a typically slender, nondescript high-rise building in Causeway Bay. While its residential-flat origins are apparent, the building's makeover works very well, from the cozy and functional lobby area to the two efficient lifts servicing the 20 floors. Rooms: I've stayed in both basic room types -- studio and suite -- and I come firmly down on the side of fellow travellers who found the rooms spacious and well thought out. Both formats make excellent use of space, and the Starck-designed furnishings and decor, while not high-end, are attractive and grow on one with successive stays at the Jia. The studio, at about 34 sq. m., is fine for the single traveller. The suite, double the size of the studio, basically adds space to the open living/dining/kitchen area while maintaining the same intimate sleeping and bathroom areas. Bathrooms in both layouts are done in a very smart grey-and-white marble; if you want a full bath, however, stay elsewhere. I was fine with the large walk-in shower, and the rest of the bathroom -- especially the clear-glass sink and bevel-mirrored medicine cabinet -- is visually and functionally appealing. Both layouts include a kitchenette; I don't cook when I travel, especially to HK, but it's a good touch to have basic kitchen amenities for urban-hipster families who may be more cooking-inclined than I. As others have noted, the windows in Jia's rooms are one feature that didn't get upgraded in the building's transformation from flats to \"boutique\" accommodations. They're single-paned, but I found the noise from the street, particularly on the higher floors on which I've stayed, minimal. Jia provides blinds, shears, and blackout curtains on all room windows; and these effectively reduce most street noise. The rooms' lighting and other electronic features (TV/DVD, A/C) take a bit of time to become user-friendly, but everything works well and looks good. One minor nitpick: the smallish (but high-quality) flat-screen TV is fixed in place: it faces the living/sitting area rather than the sleeping area, and it can't be swivelled to face the bed. No matter; one shouldn't be watching much TV while visiting HK, anyway. Quick note on the A/C: My stays at Jia have all coincided with warm or hot weather in HK, and the A/C (just one unit, even in the suites, if I remember correctly) is excellent: it has a high-power setting, which quickly cools the room to the point where it can be chilly. I like that, and I even like the continuous ventilation sounds of the A/C when it's on: good white noise while sleeping. Again, though, some travellers might find the A/C a bit too efficient, but it's a high-tech unit that probably heats the room as well in colder seasons. Two other nice Jia room touches: free local calls and internet service. Lobby/refreshments/front desk: Much happens in Jia's small lobby. The tiny reception desk, which is always staffed by at least one black-clad person, can get overwhelmed if more than a few people are simultaneously checking in our out or looking for transportation or restaurant-reservation assistance. But the property is small enough that this is not a big problem. The lobby has more Starck furniture, some comfortable, some not. There is a long, narrow table with high stools; this is the best bet for properly consuming Jia's complimentary continental breakfast (good if limited selection of fruits, breads, yoghurts, and beverages). I've not availed myself of Jia's complimentary happy-hour wine bar, but the small lobby refrigerator is always stocked with free soft drinks. (I think the San Pellegrino is a particularly welcome feature.) Restaurant/bar/dining: I've not yet eaten at Opia, Jia's hightly rated restaurant, but I plan to rectify that oversight during my next stay. Opia and the adjacent bar are, of course, very stylish, and the bar has a good snack/light-food menu as well. Location: Depending on what's important to you, Jia's location is either so-so or great. For me, it's the latter: the hotel is just one block away from the MTR, which will get you anywhere you need to go in HK. For getting to Central or other HK Island spots, Jia's Causeway Bay location is a very convenient and cheap starting point for HK's plentiful taxis. Causeway Bay is also a lively and interesting neighborhood, with lots of shopping, dining, and (local) people-watching possibilities. And, again, it's only a very short taxi, MTR, or Star Ferry ride to other interesting parts of HK. Reservations/booking: This is the one area where I hope to see improvement by Jia. Until a few months ago, one could not reserve Jia rooms directly from the website; one either had to call or e-mail the hotel. While Jia's website now features (ihotelier-provided) online booking capability, the website is not secure (at least in all of the different web browsers -- IE, Safari, Firefox -- I have tried), so I have either used Expedia or direct contact to make reservations at Jia. A warning if you use Expedia, as I did for my last stay: Jia apparently doesn't receive confirmation of Expedia or other travel-agency reservations until a minimum of 24 hours after the booking is made. I found this out the hard way during my last stay, when I arrived at Jia at 2 a.m. only to find that the hotel had no record of my booking -- two nights in a suite -- which I'd made just the day before. The receptionist explained the booking-delay possibility and then added that the hotel was pretty much full for the weekend. He did find an available room, but no suite was available that first night, so I ended up taking an available studio. By way of apology, the receptionist offered a complimentary limo from the hotel to HKIA for my departure, which I found a more-than-satisfactory response to the problem. Bottom line, I suppose, is to double-check with Jia before arrival, whatever the means of booking one uses. Value: For such a cute, hip property, Jia also represents a rare lodging value in HK. Whether booking directly with the hotel or via an online travel service such as Expedia or Orbitz, Jia's promotional rates make the rooms something of a bargain. Often, the difference in price between a studio and a suite is fairly small: I've seen as little as HKD 400, which makes the suite (at 700 sq. m.) probably the best suite bargain of any decent-or-better hotel property in HK. When I first stayed at Jia, in the summer of 2007, I booked a studio for one night at HKD 1,600 and was given a suite for that price. Even without an upgrade, that rate struck me as a good value; getting a suite for that price -- very nice. Finally, it's worth checking Jia's website at least several times before you book, as rates seem to be carefully calibrated to occupancy rates (both actual and antcipated), and you may see a drop in price from one day to the next. Conclusion: Overall, I rate Jia as an excellent accommodation option in HK. It's probably more suited to younger, urban-oriented travelers, but it represents a stylish, comfortable value for pretty much anyone.

The studio suites are small but I'm a solo traveller so it suited me. If you're a couple or a family, go for a larger size apartment or suite. The interiors are nice, diaphanous net to the bedroom area, really comfortable bed, wardrobes that light up when you open them, marble lined bathroom. And the house service was brilliant, ecah day I returned to an immaculately clean room. The reception staff were friendly and helpful too. They gave me the tip I was looking for - I'm a fanatical runner and Victoria Park is nearby but go early! Hong Kong gets busy as soon as it gets remotely light and the park becomes full - there is a small 600m track but if you want a good hours burn, do 8 circuits round the park itself but be careful of the bumping into the tai chi crowds. Back to JIA and location. I'm not a big foodie so I ate in my room but it's well located for foodie types who want to hang out at traditional/local food places in Jardine's Bazzaar or go more central. The best supermarket is in Times Square on the basement level (go down the circular staircase in the main department store). Transport is the MTR and there's a station 2 mins walk away and negotiating it all is so easy - get yourself an Octopus card from the station and you're away! My only complaints are that there is NO SOUNDPROOFING inside or out so if my neighbour was on the phone near my wall, I could hear him. The traffic noise is constant pretty much too and I could smell all the various cooking smells from the street outside. It got a bit chilly too but there is a heater and I am someone prone to feeling the slightest cold. I agree if you're a first timer and want a bit of pampering, then perhaps it's not for you but if you want to run around and explore and have a nice clean comfortable base to come back to (oh, with flat screen TV with pretty much all the main cable channels), then JIA is perfect", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "moscow", "Title": "\u201coverhyped\u201d", "Author": "akotova", "ReviewID": "UR12398766", "Content": "It's not a hotel .

I was almost reluctant to write a review for Tripadvisor as I liked the feeling that we had discovered a little gem and don't want too many people to find out about it - but fair's fair, I probably wouldnt' have booked to stay there without reading other people's reviews on here! I totally loved Jia - it was so refreshing not to be in a standard hotel room in a city - we booked a studio room and was expecting it to be much smaller than it was - it actually worked out to be quite spacious by the time they had fitted in a study area, living area, kitchenette and sleeping area - very clever use of space. We really felt like we were staying in a very cool studio flat rather than a hotel. It was also VERY cool - very stylish. I loved the lobby with its quirky designer furniture and all the little designer touches around the hotel and rooms (the light fittings, mirrors etc). The location was great, a 2mins walk to Causeway Bay MTR station which is only 3 stops from central. A taxi home from Lan Kwai Fong took only 10mins and was pretty cheap. We got back from a bar in Tsim Sha Tsui in 30mins door to door, using the MTR. (My top tip - if you get the Airport Express train into town from the airport, there is a free shuttle bus that takes you to major hotels - one of them is the Regal Hong Kong which is just opposite the Jia) The staff were really friendly and helpful, flagged down a taxi for us to get to the Airport Express station, helped me with my luggage, showed us round. Continental breakfast was included and is help-yourself in the lobby. Cable internet access was included in the room and they provided adapter and necessary cabling. The bar was very cool although it's a shame they don't have a no-smoking policy as we had to leave one night as it was sooo smoky in there, quite unpleasant.

It was definitely spacious and a good value compared with booking two traditional hotel rooms in Hong Kong of this property class. A few comments: 1) The hotel is in a very central location in HK (Causeway Bay), meaning it is close to a lot of public transportation and shopping, but it's not really a \"tourist\" area. The hotel, given it's more service apartment-oriented hospitality does not have a big concierge team to speak of. I would definitely recommend this place more for folks who are not visiting Hong Kong for the first time. 2) Related to the first point, the hotel is located at the corner of two very busy streets that DO NOT ALLOW CARS TO STOP between the hours of 7am to 7pm. The hotel (which used to be a serviced apartment complex) does NOT have a driveway, which means if you are arriving during the day, with any sort of luggage, you will need to have your car stop about a block away on a side street and get someone to help you move your bags in. Again, back to my first point about how this is better for a non first time visitor because you will be more likely to take advantage of the vast public transportation options as opposed to taking cabs all the time. 3) The hotel has a great \"mini bar\" in the lobby that provide free non-alcoholic beverages all day. Continental breakfast, tea time snacks, and wine hour is also provided at various times of day. This was a great plus. 4) For folks with families, i definitely recommend the penthouse suites. They have full dining rooms and kitchens and even a washer and dryer, which is wonderful for extended stays. 5) Opia, the restaurant there was fairly decent if a bit on the pricey side. Overall, being a HK expat, I think I would stay at the hotel again given it's convenient location and home-like amenities. However, if you're looking for tradition 5-star pampering and hotel amenities, I would recommend other places such as the Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons.", "Date": "October 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cA little NY in HKK at Jia Boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "sylviaNyc", "ReviewID": "UR8697090", "Content": "Jia Boutique hotel is a fantastic alternative to giant luxury hotels in Hong Kong, it is modern, small, stylish(Philippe Starck design) and personable.

Jia is in a great location. It's in the heart of Causeway Bay, which is a full of shops and restaurants (some high-end places, some chains, some curios) that stay open late into the night. It's right near the MTR, which can take you to Kowloon or Central in one or two stops. The price was also pretty reasonable - we booked the suite on Expedia for not much more than $200 US a night. As for the hotel itself, we were very happy with the space. The lobby is fancy but not over-the-top, and purposefully lacks all of the bells and whistles of a big chain hotel. Our suite felt like a trendy apartment in NYC, complete with plasma TV in the living room, great sound system, small kitchen, sitting area, spacious marble bathroom, and tiny but functional bedroom. Everything was very clean and sharp. The hotel provides a continental breakfast in the lobby and we we brought up lots of good fruit, cereal and coffee both mornings and ate at the kitchen table, just like we would at home. They also leavel snacks, juice and coffee/tea in the lobby so you can help yourself when you please without dealing with room service.

We stayed in a studio, which was tiny but very cleverly designed and very comfortable. My only note is that for a fairly recent hotel I was surprised that the marble in the bathroom was rusted. But this certainly did not detract from the amenity of the room. It was very comfortable and quiet. Staff were excellent, as one expects in HK. We ate at one of the hotel's two restaurants and it was fine. The free breakfast and afternoon wine at the large communal table in the lobby is a nice touch and does make you feel a bit more like you are in a home than a hotel. It also gives you an opportunity for fun people watching - the hotel's guests seemed to primairly be well-heeled young people when we were there. The hotel's best point, though, has to be its location. We'd previously stayed in Kowloon and Central and they're fun, but Causeway Bay literally bustles all night long.

Particularly after work hours, the hotel's neighborhood teems with HK shoppers. We found a Citibank ATM a block away, which was useful. One reviewer wrote in Sept. 2005 that \"the hotel is relatively new so a lot of cab drivers don't know where it is.\" Well, one year later our taxi driver hadn't heard about the hotel either. After you check in the hotel gives you a handy card with directions and locations written in Chinese to help you find your way back. It would be useful if they provided a scanned copy of that card on their website so you could print it out before your arrival. (Hotels and ryokans often do that in Japan, which helps out taxi drivers there.) THE ROOM Despite the heat and humidity outdoors (it was August), our room maintained a decent temperature (which we adjusted as necessary). Our queen-sized bed was firm but not uncomfortably so, and the quilt was pretty warm, so we actually turned up the air conditioning to avoid feeling overheated in the middle of the night. We were on the fifth floor and did hear light traffic noise below us on occasion but it didn't bother us enough to consider changing rooms. The important thing is that during the evening, the streets seemed quiet enough for us to get plenty of sleep. (It might be a different story if I tried to catch some shut-eye during the middle of the day.) Our room was small (about 450 sq. ft.) but with the desk, cabinets, and shelves recessed in the walls, the floor space was big enough to walk around without bumping into everything. The only problem was finding room to place our two suitcases; but that's a problem with all small hotels. The bathroom is all marble and indirect lighting (not the best for applying makeup or shaving) but the shower pressure was strong and the robes quite delightful. The LG flat-screen TV was a nice touch, as was the DVD/CD unit. The front desk offered English-language DVDs for borrowing, and the selection wasn't half-bad: a mixture of mainstream and art-house movies. Hong Kong television (or at least the room's cable TV) is pretty good anyway, and a lot of it is in English, so we didn't miss out on our entertainment needs. THE KITCHEN Other reviewers have commented on the free beverages available in the lobby -- there was free water in the room too. We loved our little kitchen. Take-out from Y's restaurant next door was delivered within 30 minutes and they didn't charge the typical arm-and-leg prices that hotels charge for room service. Y's range of Asian, Indian, American food was pretty impressive: coconut grilled stingray, wonton soup, spicy green mango salad, roasted Mediterranean vegetables, beef or veggie burger, wasabi beer battered fish with dashi chips, pizza, fried rice, green chicken curry, etc. We ate the food on the hotel's wonderful, square-shaped china dishes. They packed a lot into that kitchenette: two-burner electric stove, microwave oven, and a set of dishes, glasses, wine glasses, silverware, bowls, etc. for (in our case) two people. We stored leftovers in the small fridge and then reheated them later. It was somewhat challenging to balance the dishes on our laps or the small coffee tables in front of the couch, but we managed. BREAKFAST The complimentary breakfast was pretty good for \"continental breakfast\" fare, although after a few days, the same starts to get old -- but that can happen anywhere if they don't change what they offer. Still, they had a good selection of yogurt, fruit (strawberries, apples, bananas, kiwi, grapefruit -- not sure how I'd have eaten a grapefruit), cereal, toast, juice, and jam. Lots of coffee and hot water for tea, too. Hard-boiled eggs would be a nice addition to the menu, if only to provide some protein amid all the usual carbs. Free newspapers (International Herald-Tribune plus some Chinese papers) were an added bonus. Even though this did not bother us personally, the breakfast serving area in the lobby is quite cramped. I don't know how a dozen guests would be able to navigate that area at once, let alone find a place to sit down to eat breakfast. By luck we pretty much had the place to ourselves, besides a couple other guests. Once or twice we carried food to our rooms for variety's sake (trays would have helped, as carrying plates and cups/glasses into the elevator invites certain disaster). We were usually out when they had their free afternoon wine service in the lobby but a couple times we were there to enjoy the wine, which was actually quite good. SERVICE The customer service was excellent. We asked them many questions about where to eat, how to get to places, etc. and they always answered us with a smile and a determination to provide us with the most complete, helpful information. The staff was always impeccably dressed too (uniforms designed by Shanghai Tang, our Frommer's Guide informed us). We had informed them beforehand of our early arrival (8 AM) and they were very accommodating. A room was available immediately. When we left six days later, they held our luggage for several hours after check-out until we departed Hong Kong later that day. ONLY COMPLAINT This is fairly minor but the lobby's background music became tiring after a while because it was so repetitive. It's a very hip, modern collage of techno lounge music (probably not the most precise description) and they play it seemingly 24/7. The same tunes, and loudly. (You can play the same music in the room too, thanks to the CD they provide, available for purchase.) It's OK stuff, but it would have been nice to enjoy a morning of quietude now and then. There was a table in a small side room to sit down at and watch TV but the lobby's soundtrack overpowered the broadcast. At first we were pretty impressed by these decorative trappings, but after a few days they started to give us the feeling of perpetually being on stage.

Do go to Disneyland - small but perfectly formed and in a beautiful setting. We found this hotel via the excellent Tablet Hotels website (--) highly recommend it for more of the same.", "Date": "April 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "South America", "Title": "\u201cOverrated\u201d", "Author": "Nessie_the_Monster", "ReviewID": "UR4992867", "Content": "Rooms are too small, breakfast is boring, location is so-so and for the same rate you can get much better options.", "Date": "April 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cFabulous dahhlings\u201d", "Author": "JJ-travels", "ReviewID": "UR4981549", "Content": "Beautiful lobby, beautiful rooms, great amenities, could plug our ipod into the tv/ surround sound system and chill out. Loved the free soft drinks all day plus cocktail hour - free wine - always good! Staff extremely friendly, couldn't ask for more. Our room on 9th floor was a bit noisy from buses etc below and they changed us to a quieter higher floor with no quibbles at all. Room service from the ground floor restaurant was great and i think their food was better (and much cheaper) than the rated ozzy chef, ? restaurant (cant remember name) on the 1st floor. we would definately come back here again.", "Date": "April 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Monica", "Title": "\u201cBest Deal in Town!!!\u201d", "Author": "g1wzwnd", "ReviewID": "UR4396579", "Content": "We had a perfect experience at this hotel. First of all the price was right, we paid about $190 US per night. The hotel is brand new, the staff was very nice and spoke good english, the room was great with plasma TV, fridge and an excelent shower. Breakfast in the morning was great and you can take water, soda and juices to your room for free. Room service was also very nice and the limo to the airport (brand new Mercedes) was worth the $90. We wanted to stay at the Penninsula however this hotel was very nice and highly recommended. We also book two tours with them which were great and cheap and allows you to see HK from a nice van. The only thing that needs improvement is the bed which was too hard for my taste. enjoy your stay.", "Date": "January 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cWho needs the Peninsula !?\u201d", "Author": "MrJ", "ReviewID": "UR4335381", "Content": "Hong Kong is the classic ex-pat kind of city that believes style has to equal a fair dollop of chintz and gold. If it were not for the Felix Bar at the top of the Peninsula I can't think of a reason to pay it a visit (and actually even the bar is not that great compared to Aqua). So pushing the grand old dames of so called class and grandeur aside....I was overjoyed to fall upon Hotel JIA. Philippe Starcks involvement is obvious from the lobby entrance to the finishing touches in the rooms. Although totally unimpressive from the outside, the location is superb and therefore the price excellent. Our room was large, sexy and not a sign of chintz in sight. The hotels restaurant also happens to be one of THE hippest and coolest bars/eateries to hang out in. Being a resident also gives you access to the 'VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO' Kee Club (HK's version of Soho House) so the benefits are abound. Breakfast is served in a rather haphazard way in the lobby but unless you need a traditional english fry up or have a demand for specific eggs because you come from Florida and are on a bizarre diet your trainer has concocted, then muffins, tea, fruit and juice will do just fine! The staff were lovely, the vibe was fab - give it a go. If you like any Starck hotel, you will love this. If you want a view, oldey-worldy HK charm and a taxi-rank awaiting your command outside...forget it.", "Date": "January 10, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "J Plus Boutique Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d503464-Reviews-J_Plus_Boutique_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$194 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.1-5 Irving Street, Causeway Bay</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> (Formerly Jia Boutique Hotel)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "503464", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/83/73/11/j-plus-boutique-hotel.jpg"}}
