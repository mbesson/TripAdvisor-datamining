We stayed for one week at Emine Sultan Hotel, so we can only refer to this part. It is situated in a rather quiet street just 5 minutes by foot from the Hippodrom/Blue Mosque. They arranged bustransfer from and to the airport as well as a Bosporus boattrip, which we heartly enjoyed and specially recommend. The rooms are clean and neat in ottoman style. Our room had a magnificent view over the Marmara Sea to the asian districts of the city. The room itself was equipped with a double bed and was in good condition; the bathroom had seen some time but was clean and comfy. Only minor shortcomming was the tripping noise from the stairway and the level above, due to the sultanahmed type construction of the building. But as the hotel features only 10 rooms there was not that much traffic and therefore you can get along with that. The breakfast room also features a 180\u00c2\u00b0 view of marmara sea and part of the busporus as well as the blue mosque. Breakfast buffet is of turkish style (Cheese, B\u00c3\u00b6rek, Wineleafes and fresh cakes etc.) and delicious. Most of the food is homemade by a especially friendly and polite lady, who also serves the breakfast. After breakfast time tea is provided in the breakfast room for the rest of the day. There's a terrace at the rooftop which is also a nice place to relax. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpfull. The whole hotel features a cosy atmosphere and the staff is eager to make you feel at home.

The Suites is a small (4 room) sister hotel to the main Emine Sultan located at what seemed like the edge of the tourist district. It is not a hotel as such but more a small guest house. We stayed in the top floor room which was lovely with a balcony facing the sea and a Jacuzzi in the room which was a great surprise. The room was clean and well serviced with a fridge, air conditioning, large flat screen TV, good shower and even a hairdryer which was useful. What I would say to balance this is however is that the service was not good. A few things to mention; there was a small Hamam and Sauna in the hotel which was never introduced so we never had the chance to use it. The breakfast service was variable and seemed to struggle in particular when all the rooms were full, the food on offer was tasty if slightly repetitive, but coffee often short and more not forthcoming. The hotel was also locked up when we came home one day which was disappointing. Most importantly however the hostess was very pushy about organised events in particular a boat trip and some sort of Turkish dancing night the former very overpriced and the later of no interest to us. These events were mentioned repeatedly for the first four days of the trip (to the point where we were dreading it) and when it became clear that we were not going to be taking up either offer service took a nose dive. This culminated in a very bad atmosphere particularly when it came to settling up and leaving. We had to walk up the road to use the credit card facility in another building which is not out of the ordinary but was clearly highly inconvenient for our host. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid this left me with a bad taste after out most enjoyable stay in Istanbul. All in all it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lovely little guest house but maybe its best to go on the 25 Euro boat trip it might work out better for you this way!", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellingham, WA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service\u201d", "Author": "comcox", "ReviewID": "UR118851058", "Content": "We were booked for two nights at Emine Sultan Hotel at the end of our trip to Turkey. As our shuttle van wound it's way into the tiny streets off the highway from the airport our first night, I wondered where exactly we were going. There were just a few small hotels, a couple of private dwellings and lots of quiet so I wondered how far away from things we were. However, the light of the next day and a very short walk brought me right to the famed Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, and Hagia Sophia--you couldn't imagine a more perfect location. From our second floor window (Room 203) we could look out on the ships passing through the Bosphorus. The room with two twin beds was snug and since my main chore for this stay was to reorganize all our suitcases before flying home it was a tight space. But there was a nice homey feel to the room. On the rooftop is a terrace where breakfast is served--a buffet with a fairly good selection of items including cocoa (a first on our whole trip). The lobby is quite elegant and includes a computer for free guest use. There is an elevator but it's one person plus one suitcase size so it took us more than one trip. The staff are quite wonderful and speak excellent English. When our shuttle van to the airport did not show up as scheduled on departure morning, the desk man called around to find us alternate transportation and said he would pay the driver and then bill our tour company himself. A block away is a main street that has cafes and shops. A great place to eat is the cafe attached to the Abella Hotel which offers meals throughout the day.

The sheets and towels were fresh every day, but not of the quality of the 5 star hotels. The room was actually pretty! - Good solid blinds shutout the sun and the view from neighbouring hotels, when needed. - The stairs were easier and quicker to take than the tiny elevator. - There was some noise transfer from activities on the stairs and landing. - The food and food choices were simple and adequate. The breakfast area had a nice view and became a social area for hotel residents to touch bases and share their experiences from the day before. - Only hotel to give us a complementary bottle of 'welcome' wine. Water on first day also free. - Several mosques in the immediate area, so at 6:15 am you get several versions of the call to prayer. We actually enjoyed this part of our experience. - Location is great. Very short walk to the Calvary Bazaar, Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Haghia Sophia Basilica, Topkapi Palace, underground cistern, and the shops/restaurants of the Sultanahmet. With a little more energy you are quickly at the 300 year old 'New Mosque', Egyptian Spice Bazaar, Grand Bazaar, and Galata Bridge. The owner and staff were very friendly and helpful.

We are fortunate enough to travel for 3-4 months of every year and always stay in small well-priced accommodation wherever we go in the World (even some homestays), never in big impersonal hotels. For seasoned travellers there are some key points to selecting a place to stay, and most of the reviews here don't really cover these succinctly enough. So here goes (Emine Sultan comments in brackets): Airport transfers provided (very good indeed and reasonably priced too) Free WIFI throughout that works well (excellent, also a free internet computer in reception) Good breakfast (more than adequate) Coffee/tea making (available free all day together with snacks, juices & fruit in b'fast room- excellent) Quiet for sleeping (you can't get away from the early morning mosque call anywhere in Istanbul! Otherwise adequate....providing the others on your tiny 3-room floor are considerate when coming and going...which our American neighbours were not at times) Comfortable beds (sadly no, three of the four of us on this trip still have bad backs from the over-firm mattresses) Room of adequate size (again sadly no, and the bathrooms are miniscule.....however having peeked into a corner bedroom when being cleaned this certainly appeared larger....request one of these in advance if staying here) Fridge in room (yes- great) Bar (no) Views (good from higher floor rooms, and excellent from the little rooftop terrace) Location (not bad, a bit off the beaten track, but still in the old quarter. Akbiyik Caddesi is full of restaurants, bars and places to stay if you want to be closer to night spots and the sights) Friendly & helpful staff (OK, but the place is generally very quiet and low-key) Hope these specifics help others. This has to be one of the tiniest places we've stayed in. There are many other similar Ottoman-style places to stay scattered all around these streets which all appear to be very similar. One last thing: beware 'bumping'. We were told on arrival that we could only stay for 3 of the 4 nights we were booked, as they had overbooked, and that we would have to be moved somewhere else for the last night. We politely pointed out we would not be moving anywhere and that it was their problem to resolve.

We were not disappointed. From our earliest emails with Ozen, to the easily arranged ride from the airport, to the actual stay and departure, everything was as we had hoped. The Emine Sultan is a charming boutique hotel with a very helpful staff. We stayed in the 4th floor room adjacent to the breakfast room. While it was somewhat small, with creative organizing, it was still fine even though we had 4 suitcases with us (we'd been on a 2 week cruise). Managing all 4 suitcases in the small elevator was challenging, though, but again, possible. The bathroom was fine too, although it had a small tub/shower combo which really wouldn't have worked well for an adult bath. But it was terrific for sitting in and soaking tired feet while enjoying a glass of wine from the complimentary bottle provided at check-in! Even though our days were mostly rainy during our time in Istanbul, from our window, we got the view of the Blue Mosque to the left and the Sea of Marmara to the right. As far as outside sound, we didn't really experience what we characterize as noise, but then we don't expect total dead silence in a city or even want that. We both expected and appreciated the beauty of hearing the call to prayer early in the morning. Breakfast was good - it had cereal, some omelet, hardboiled eggs, fresh tomatoes, olives, really good feta cheese, cold cuts, pastries, etc. There was also fruit and of course juices and coffee or tea. We thought this hotel was very well located. Pretty well everything a visitor wants to see is within fairly easy walking distance, but for those of us who like to wear heels, beware. As in most other older cities, heels don't work well on cobblestones (wet or otherwise) or uneven hilly pavement. The Blue Mosque is just a few minutes away and the Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace not much further. This is a great area for exploring with its surprises around every corner, not to mention all the cats for those of us missing our pets at home. There are lots of food choices close by in various price ranges and the hotel gave us good suggestions. If you haven't chosen anything otherwise, pretty well every restaurant will have a menu outside with someone giving you a business card so you don't forget them. Make sure you try the freshly squeezed pomegranate juiceoffered from many stands; it was one of the food highlights of our stay and so much better than in the bottles we buy at home at the store. Staying at the Emine Sultan contributed so much to our enjoyment of our first trip to Istanbul - it is welcoming, comfortable, safe, clean, good value, and truly charming.

The view from the terrace is of the Bosphorus and the Blue Mosque - especially stunning at night. The area feels quite safe, though single ladies shouldn't venture out too late at night - a pair of us went for a nargileh at about 10pm to 11pm and it was very quiet, though the streets were well lit. Service: Pre-arrival communication was very friendly and prompt. Check in was smooth, half a bottle of wine and free bottles of water were available in the fridge. What distinguishes the Emine is the service and the smiles - especially Akhan who fixed us up a cup of tea at 8pm our first night after we came back with aching feet, having explored the Grand Bazaar. The hotel felt like a home - we spent ages larking about in the dining room, taking photos, sipping tea, chilling out. The room: We stayed in a 3-bedder and although the room was small-ish, it was perfectly adequate for us. After all, we weren't visting Istanbul just to stay in our rooms and watch the flat screen plasma tv! The room was clean, with floral bedspreads, wonderful wooden window blinds and some white roller blinds. They mostly face East, so if light is a problem, bring an eye mask. The hotel rooms were not built for noise insulation (remember it is a converted old house) and you can hear other guests and the lift. Bring ear plugs to solve problem - we hardly even heard the morning call to prayer, our sleep was so deep. The bathroom was a little musty, but very clean. The hotel provides bath towels, slippers (a nice touch!) and face towels. Breakfast: Breakfast was a cold Turkish breakfast - much much better than many a cold breakfast provided at hotels in Europe. The spread included boiled eggs, pastries, borek, dolmades, cereals, fresh yoghurt, a basket of fresh breads, about 8 different types of home made jams (We tried them all!), soft cheese, cold meat, and sweet pastries. Jars of turkish delight, apricots and cookies were also available. There was also coffee, tea, Nesquik for kids, Turkish tea, apple tea - a more than adequate breakfast. Overall: The Emine Sultan is a boutique hotel that represents excellent value for money, (EUR105 for a three bedder per night) is located right in the heart of Sultanahmet (walking distance to the Big Three: Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya & Topkapi) and has exceptional service.

We took the overnight train from Greece to Turkey, and were told to call the hotel for a pickup when we arrived at the train station. We stepped off the train at around11am, and called the hotel. We were told we would be picked up shortly and to just wait inside. Just a short time later, our driver arrived and quickly showed us to the hotel's van. As soon as we got in, we knew we had made the right choice. The van was beautiful, plush, and actually had turkish carpets on the floor! We sat back and enjoyed a luxurious ride to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, Hakan was quick to make us feel at home. While our room was being readied (we were there before check in but, no problem) we were invited to sit in the lobby area. This is a lovely seating area, very cozy and well appointed. We were served chai and our host chatted with us until our bags were settled into our room. We were shown up the elevator to our room, which was a pleasant surprise also. The room was larger than we expected, and had a refrigertor, tv, and three windows that looked out over the harbor. Every day a large bottle of water was delivered to our refrigerator,and we were given a welcome bottle of wine to begin our stay. We were already very happy about our choice, when we were invited to go \"upstairs\" for a beer to unwind before heading out to explore. So up we went to the rooftop restaurant, where breakfast is served each morning. What a view of the sea and Blue Mosque. Breakfast is plentiful and varied and included. Coffee, tea, cheeses, meats, hard boiled eggs, olives, tomatoes, breads and the best little cookies! Then we went up one more floor to a rooftop garden terrace, where you can enjoy your snack and the views. The location is fantastic, just a short walk to the Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sofia, and of course, the Grand Bazaar. We walked everywhere, it was close enough to all the sights to be able to go out early, come back to the hotel in late afternoon, and go back out for the evening festivities. We were there during Ramadan, and every night there is a celebration around the Blue Mosque and along the Hippodrome, so this location was the best. Whenever we had questions about things to see, or places to go, the staff was more than helpful and very friendly. In fact, we sometimes met them out in the evening and were introduced to their friends also enjoying the evenings in Istanbul.

We wanted to do a day trip to Gallipoli and we were given 3 significantly different prices (1 lower price before we arrived, 1 higher price + offer for a very expensive private tour upon check-in). We ended up booking with another agent who was cheaper. The breakfast was fine, pretty standard, nothing extraordinary. There was a bit of a mosquito problem which was odd in the middle of winter.

It took some doing, I considered what they had to say and then decided that some people are probably not happy anywhere. If you are in any doubt then read the positive reviews - they really are accurate. I stayed here for 4 nights in December with my wife and two friends. The hotel owner had arranged transfers for us from the airport and, on arrival at the hotel we were offered drinks. Being tired and not thinking straight, two of us asked if they had a beer and Hakan on reception didn't bat an eyelid. What we realised shortly afterwards was he had to run out to a nearby shop to buy two bottles of beer for us (at no charge) - and that just typifies the level of service they offer you throughout your stay. Nothing is too much trouble. The reality is that this is a small hotel in the old part of Istanbul that prides itself on it's level of service and cleanliness. There isn't a luxurious bar area and the breakfast may seem limited (however it is more than adequate and the fresh breads and home made jams are excellent) but at 85 euros a night what do you want? The rooms are spacious for two people and are cleaned to a high level each day with clean towels provided. Water is provided in the fridge when you arrive along with a complimentary half bottle of wine - I've stayed in more expensive so called luxury hotels that don't do that. So, you may be woken fairly early in the morning by the call to prayers from the nearby minarets but we are the visitors to their city and it was a small price to pay for such atmosphere. Tea and coffee is available all day in the fourth floor breakfast area with stunning views over the Sea of Marmara and the entrance to the Bosphorous. As we were leaving Ozen, the owner, suggested we check in on line for our flights. I was going to use the terminal for guests in the lobby but instead she took me to her office to use her computer because the printer would be quicker for us. Small touches all the time that grow to give you a very satisfying experience of staying in Istanbul.

Certainly a person you should take advice from. In one instance I wanted to visit a hamam (Tyrkish Bath) but didn't fancy some of the more touristic places. Burhan then arranged for my visit to his personal hamam - if you ever dreamt of a tyrkish bath - don't miss it!

He works the day shift, and on one of our nights, he worked 36 hours straight. But I don't see anyone here talking about him so maybe his name is Burhan, not sure. Anyway, Ozen also told us about a non-touristy hamam and when I asked her how much cash we should bring, she offered to lend us money. What kind of hotel does that? We've only stayed in big chain hotels such as Holiday Inn and Sheraton so this type of personal attention was very shocking (in a good way). Also, one of the mornings, we were sleeping past 10am when the front desk called us to remind us to have breakfast. That was a bit odd, but still speaks to the amount of personal attention you get here. And when we were leaving, we took a shuttle to the airport for 8 euros (4 per person), but we only had 50-euro bills. Teddy Bear did not have change and said it was okay, the hotel would not charge us. I gave him all I had - about 3-4 euros in coins, and a few US dollar bills. The only negative part (which isn't the fault of the hotel) was that the \"non-touristy\" hamam still treated us like tourists. Ozen told us to bring our own towel, shampoo, and slippers so that they can't charge us extra, and said we would spend 40 YTL/person, max. When we got there, however, we were only shown 2 options: 40 YTL for bath, 50 YTL for bath, massage, and tip. And the ride back that we were promised was a bit more harrowing, as the hamam employees expected us to walk back, when we had just arrived in Istanbul a few hours prior. After calling the hotel (hotel told us to call them if there was a problem), they put us in a taxi, which dropped us off near the Blue Mosque because I don't think the driver knew where the hotel was. But we had no idea where we were, and wandered around until we found a restaurant owner who was willing to call the hotel for us. A few minutes later, we saw Hakkan running towards us to get us.

If you have read the other reviews, you know about Ozen, who runs the hotel with unbelievable passion and charming personality. This is the real deal -- authentic and sincere in every way. This is not the Four Seasons Lite. If you want a ritzy and secluded enclave w/ all the trimmings of a resort, I can't say Emine Sultan is for you. That being said, their 10 rooms are beautifully appointed, and ours overlooked the Sea of Marmara, w/ mosque minarets in the foreground. The Blue Mosque is a stone's throw from the hotel and hovers over it in the coolest way. In general, hard to beat the location if you're interested in seeing Istanbul's many sights. But back to the main attraction -- Ozen and her supporting players. My wife (we were on our honeymoon) and I had come from Santorini and Crete in Greece, and despite how amazing that was, as we flew home, we couldn't stop talking about our new friends in Istanbul. Sitting in the lobby of the hotel is as fun/relaxing/entertaining as anything else in Turkey. Burhan and Erhan (\"Teddy Bear\") took outrageous steps to show us the city and explain things to us. They are truly special people, and I almost hesitate to describe all that they did for us, for fear of overpromising the same services to other guests.

I'm guessing that the reason we had only a so-so experience at this hotel is because while we were there, the owner, Ozen was absent. Perhaps the staff needs her presence to keep up standards. The hotel is in a very good location, only a few minutes walk to many major attractions. Be warned that many taxi drivers do not know where this hotel is located, so plan on walking. If you do have to take a taxi in Istanbul, be resigned to the fact that you will be cheated one way or another, and don't fall for the common scam where you give the driver a large note for payment, such as 50 lira, and he hides it or drops it on the floor and insists that you only gave him a 5 lira note. Get out of the cab before paying and make sure the driver acknowledges how much you are paying before giving him the fare. When we were shown to our room, the staff gave us no information about anything (such as how to use the safe in the closet or information about local attractions) except for the breakfast hours. Our room had 2 twin beds, which were hard as rocks. There was no top sheet on the bed, just a very heavy and lumpy comforter covered with a duvet. We had a view of the Bosphorus from our windows. Unfortunately, the windows aren't sealed very well, and not only let in cold air, but also smoke from the fireplaces of nearby houses and a lot of street noise. We could also clearly hear guests checking in next door in the early morning hours as well as the conversations they had in their room. Bring ear plugs. The bath was small, but adequate. We were served nothing like the breakfasts raved about in many reviews here - certainly no fresh pastries or cakes, and nothing like the photos on the hotel's web site. Just a basket of bread slices (no toaster), cold cereal, and assorted meats and cheeses which appeared to be the same trays set out all week. Coffee (very weak), tea, 2 juices and milk were also available. The woman working in the breakfast room was very nice, but did not speak English. Some of the staff had limited or no English skills as well. On our last night, the glass soap dish over the sink just fell off the wall, shattering into many pieces on the floor. I went down to the desk to ask for a clean up and the desk clerk could not understand what I needed. The free WIFI was nice, but it didn't always work properly.

On various different aspects of the hotel: Cleanliness - it is extremely clean. I simply cannot believe reviews that say that the hotel is dirty. It makes no sense for the management to clean one room or most of the rooms but not all of them. Location - good. It's a five to ten minute walk to the Blue Mosque and add another couple of minutes for the Sultanahmet tram station. Part of the way is uphill. The area behind the Blue Mosque is residential, as is much of Istanbul. There will be locals around and children playing in the streets - indeed, isn't that part of the charm? Cats - Cats are very popular in Muslim culture (and dogs are considered not so good). You will see lots of cats and they do mate every now and then, as do humans. It is, at least so far, the only way of keeping the species going. Breakfast - Tea, coffee (in pot, not Turkish), eggs, bread, cake, fruit conserve, honeycomb, yoghurt, butter, sliced meat, sausages, olives, various cheeses, cornflakes, Turkish delights, fruit, tomato, cucumber, omelette and freshly squeezed juice (both if you ask), non-fresh juices. That's about all I remember for now. Produce is fresh. It is a sufficient breakfast but if you expect a feast you may be disappointed. Prayer calls - it is part of the experience of travelling in another country with another dominant religion. The experience, even if it's being woken up at 5am, is culturally enriching. Travelling is more than \"doing\" the sites, taking the pictures so that you can say \"been there, done that\" to your jealous friends. So if tourists are to be disturbed by prayer calls, rethink destination - one is likely to have the same problem wherever one stays in a Muslim country. Staff - Ozen sat down and had coffee with me and helped me plan my first couple of days, which was nice of her as I didn't do my homework. Whether she can do that for everyone I know not, but I think she tries. Bottom line - I don't travel just to make friends with hotel staff, so as long as they are reasonably helpful and nice then that is enough for me. Staff here definitely passed this test. Noise - didn't really notice the traffic but sometimes tour buses do pass through on the next street. Hotel itself is built in wood so it will be more noisy. View - spectacular. Blinds - not so good as don't block out the sun. Shower - excellent. If problems identified by earlier travellers did indeed exist (e.g. no explanations about the mini-bar, telephone service) the management has made an effort to correct them.

Great water pressure \u00c4\u00b1n the shower (and no shortage of hot water!). There was always a bottle or two of free water in the minifridge everyday. They were replaced as we used them.

If you ask, you can even have a delicious omelette made. The hotel's location couldn't be better. It is a short walk from the Blue Mosque, Ayasofia, and the Arasta Bazaar. There are lots of excellent retaurants and cafes nearby as well.

The only downside is that the windows were quite thin and didn't offer great soundproofing, and we were woken up at 5 every morning for the morning call to prayer, but considering the amount of mosques in the city I'm not sure you could get away from it in any hotel. Breakfast was nice, it had many cheeses to try, olives, cereals, bread and boiled egg. Ozen (one of the owners) mother made us turkish coffee to try, which was quite nice! Ozen and her father run the hotel, and they are both very friendly and informative! I feel that their presence adds to the charm of this small hotel. It's in a great location, about 5 minutes from the Hagia Sofia and Blue Mosque, and about a 25 minute drive from the airport in light traffic. Also, they have free internet acess in the reception. If I went to Istanbul again, I would definetly go back to this hotel!", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, But be wary of all the gushing reviews\u201d", "Author": "spank_inferno", "ReviewID": "UR26519599", "Content": "My wife and I have just returned from a 2 night stay in the Emine Sultan where we had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is located amongst some narrow streets in the heart of the Sultanamat district of the city. It is in residential area with a few kids (and many cats) about. The hotel is a small 4 storey building. Just inside the entrance there is a courtesy laptop for going online with a pretty good connection speed. The staff were very nice. Ozan is a lovely woman and alongside her brother and father they run the place. The rooms are nice, nothing fancy & quite clean. Bathrooms are also good, with hot water available and good shower preassure.. As a previous reviewer mentioned, The mini bar situation was never explained so we didnt use it. The room had 20inch flat screen with about 60 channels. Unfortunately the only english language ones are BBC news, BBC Prime & CNN. Breakfast: Modest fare it has to be said. There is quite limited choice but the house keeper did make us a turkish coffee which was nice of her. The stay: As mentioned, though in the heart of the old city, this area is a warren of small residential streets. The hotel has very poor noise insulation. So be warned if you are a light sleeper. I was woken on the first night by some neighbourhood cats \"expressing their intimacy\" outside. Traffic noise was also very noticable. The floors are wooden also so there isnt a lot of internal sound insulation either. Considering its very close proximity to the sights of instanbul I would still consider this hotel good value. Other reviewers throw the \"5-dots\" review like confetti, but I want to give as rounded review as possible. The staff are lovely and helpfull but the hotel has its weakpoints as I mentioned above. Therefore though competent it cannot be considered a top hotel. Personally we loved our stay, But I can see where some guests might feel dissapointed.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cO.k., but doesn't live up to the reviews\u201d", "Author": "gracie-boo", "ReviewID": "UR26468630", "Content": "I have to be honest. I really wanted to love the Emine Sultan, but I just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I usually rely on Tripadvisor reviews when visiting a new city, and I carefully read through the Istanbul Hotel recommendations, and emailed several hotels before choosing the Emine Sultan. I liked the tone of the owner/manager, Ozen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emails; she sounded friendly and extremely helpful, so we chose the Emine Sultan on that basis. We took a prearranged shuttle from the airport to the hotel (20 Euros), and check-in was efficient and easy. There are narrow stairs you may use to get to your room, or the hotel has a very small elevator. We had room 203, which did have a view of the Bosporus, over the rooftops. The room was very clean, with two twin beds, a flat screen TV, wardrobe and small table. I was very impressed with the water pressure in the shower; it was great, and there was always plenty of hot water. There was a small refrigerator under the TV; it was filled with soft drinks, beer and water, but I have no idea how the mini bar worked, as this was never explained to us. We just bought our water elsewhere and stored it in the refrigerator. We were not given any information about the hotel by the staff at the desk, except that breakfast would be served between the hours of 8-10. No one told us where the guest accessible computer was located (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the lobby, where many times, the desk clerk was using it), and I did not even know there was a rooftop terrace, until we accidentally stumbled onto it the last day of our stay. We never saw the owner/manager, Ozen, our entire visit. I am not sure where she was. It does seem to me though, that perhaps many of the Emine Sultan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s glowing reviews have something to do with her personality/helpfulness, etc., and not with the hotel itself. I did not ask for help with any sort of plans, such as dining recommendations, tours, etc. from the front desk, so I cannot comment upon the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helpfulness. They did offer the use of an umbrella when it was raining, but we had brought our own. In reading other reviews of the Emine Sultan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast offerings, I am wondering if we stayed at the same place. We did not ever see any cake or cookies or any other pastries offered at breakfast. For the first five mornings we were there, there was an orange flavored loaf bread which is the only pastry type food I saw. There was always a counter with three types of juices and most times a container of milk. Coffee, hot water and tea were also provided. There is tip box on the drink counter. Sometimes, there was also a bowl of fruit, such as apples. Another counter always had an assortment of cheeses, which looked increasingly weary as the week went on, olives, a couple different types of sliced meats, tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced French type bread, and some green peppers which were never touched. Jams and usually butter were also prprovided. I was very, very tired of the same offerings by the sixth day, and even though I am not usually a breakfast eater, longed for a toaster and some bread. The location is good and we walked everywhere in Sultanhamet, and never took the public transportation. Just had one very unpleasant experience with a taxi; highly recommend you avoid them at all costs, unless you are well versed on all the very many ways they can try to scam you. I advise you to bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper; the street outside has trucks going by with slamming doors and loud noises all night long. I am a very heavy sleeper, and it even bothered me. One night, I was awakened at 1:00 am, by the arrival of some new guests in the room next door. Even the hotel staff who accompanied them to their room, stood outside talking very loudly in the hallway for at least 15 minutes. Very inconsiderate. I never knew how to phone the front desk, but I did email the hotel using my phone to complain about the noise, but I never received any response. A note about the WIFI coverage; during our stay, it was very erratic, and often times would not be accessible for hours at a time. After these guests checked in, I could hear everything through the walls of their room. Unfortunately, they were night owls who liked to bang around and watch TV until the wee hours of the morning. Payback came the next morning as the call to prayer at 6:15 am woke them up. You will be able to hear this call from at least three different mosques, so if this bothers you, again, bring ear plugs. Check out was again efficient, but the desk clerk seemed confused as to what our room cost, and had to call someone to find out what the rate was (85 Euro per night). He was able to split the charge so we each paid half, which was helpful and convenient for us. The Emine Sultan was not a bad place to stay; the location was convenient and the rooms clean. I guess just expected more from reading all the over-the-top reviews and feel somewhat disappointed. Would I stay here again if I went back to Istanbul?

The hotel is recently renovated and our double room (202) was spotlessly clean and exactly as shown on the hotels website (including the view of the Bosphorus). It was also big enough to accommodate the extra bed for our eight year old (at no extra charge) without being particularly cramped. There is free WLAN access throughout the hotel and a computer for guest use located in reception. We paid 70 Euros a night and while larger, more expensive hotels may match or exceed the facilities and location they are unlikely to be as accommodating or easy to deal with as the Emine Sultan.
