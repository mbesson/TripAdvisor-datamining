It has a big 32\u2019 LCD TV. Room is reasonably big while Bathroom does not have a bath tub. The room also has got a very small window and of course there is no balcony (I guess it is with Suites only). If you love to look out of your room, pls ask for rooms with double window when you reserve. WiFi Internet access is free and that is a big plus. Big windows would have earned rooms 1 more star from me. It does have a mini refrigerator as well. Iron and ironing board, travel adaptors are available upon request. Late check out/ early check in are allowed subject to availability at no extra cost Restaurant: Does not have any of its own. But they do serve breakfast for free. Limited items but taste is good and breakfast is sufficient. As for lunch/ dinner, there is a French restaurant (Picotin) in the same campus, most haunted by locals, so one can try that (min S$60 for 3 course meal) . Else, about 300 meters away you have plenty of restaurants/ bars (including 2 Indian restaurants) on sixth avenue. Room Rates: Reasonably priced. But do try to call hotel for discounts before booking. (Rack rates are much higher than what you book at) Proximity: No MRT nearby but there is one coming up in year 2014. Bus stop is 250 meters away from where you can find buses to nearest MRT or even Orchard Road. Interestingly the place has direct link by bus to major shopping areas besides Orchard like Boon Lay, Bukit Timah, Clementi besides those who have work in NUS Kent Bridge, there is a direct connection too. There is a supermarket (Cold Storage) nearby as well. In the hotel compound, there is a famous but expensive Spa as well. If going by taxi, please tell driver that you have to go near horsecity opposite sixth avenue on Bukit Timah Road because this place/ hotel is not well known among the cabbies. Verdict: The hotel is in a compound where besides hotel there is a Montessori, a French restaurant, a Spa besides a horse turf and a dog compound. At the rate being offered and the access to various places, I have all praise for this hotel. A hotel that could have completed the 5 star rating if limitations are addressed. Plus: Rooms, location, internet access (if it works) Minus: Maintenance staff works at their own leisure. I could not access internet at one point in time and it made me call them almost 6 times and they took 5 days to correct the problem. Upon check out when I asked for discount on account of internet issue, I was told that since it was for free so no discounts. I hope someday they should not come n say \u201ctoday no breakfast\u201d and since it is also for free so hardly as a guest we can do \uf04a. No choice in cable channels. No Hindi channel. Paid parking at S$1/hr during day time & half after that. Verdict: Dont choose just because it has got good reviews. It is near to no tourist spot and the price you pay for it, can get you a descent accommodation in the city. I choose it because it has direct access to NUS. Choose this only if you feel like staying in a resort.

It was my wife's first visit to Singapore and I had reservations about booking a hotel so far from Orchard road or a MRT station. It turned out to be a pretty good place to stay for the price charged. Where shall I start? Ok, this hotel is pretty far from where the action is in Singapore. Every day, we had to take a cab from the front of the hotel to the nearest MRT station (about a good five mile drive). Funny thing is, the taxi drivers do not know about this hotel, although they know about the old \"horse track\". If they don't know the exact location, just tell that that is by the old race track by Bukit Timah Road and they will know where to go. One way fare to and from the MRT station is about $5 to $7 SGD, which is VERY reasonable if you factor in the US$ exchange rate. Back to the hotel review... the staff go out of their way to make you happy. When our cab arrived at the hotel from the airport, the bell boy walked all the way to the cab (a good 30 meters) to get our bags. The concierge was very courteous, although their comprehension of conversational English can be improved. On the last day, the wake-up call was on the dot. We got a Grandeur room and it was fantastic. The room was on the ground floor, and is isolated from the rest of the building as it is at the tip of a \"transept\" that crosses the main building, akin to a European cathedral, for lack of a better description. The room thus juts into a lush green backyard lawn, away from the rest of the building. A nice tall window in the room gives you a generous view of the well manicured lawn and the tropical trees that occasionally have wild monkeys lounging lazily on the branches. At night, you can hear crickets chirping outside and there is a quiet ambiance in the entire compound. The interior decor of the room itself is modern yet restrained. Don't expect the ultra-modern furnishings from Orchard Road type boutique hotels. There is a flat screen TV that dominates the central wall and a nice desk in front of a large mirror. The bed is soft and gives you a quiet night's respite from a whole day of tourist activities. There is WIFI connection and it is FREE. There is also a nice closet with a mini safe for your passports and spare cash. If there is a complaint, that would be the size of the safe as it could have been bigger to accommodate a moderately sized laptop computer. There is a dead-bolt and a chain on the door to provide a good measure of security; not that the hotel is in a \"bad\" area, the whole place is smack in a upper middle class residential neighborhood and is VERY safe. The bathroom is perhaps the biggest detractor. There isn't a bath tub. You have a stand-up shower, similar to a high school locker room's. Soap (hair and body) is squirted from a dispenser similar to what you'd find in public bathrooms. On the other hand, everything is kept extremely CLEAN. Room service does a good job making sure that you find your room spotlessly clean every day and this is highly commendable! The air conditioning is god sent and provides a night of cool dry air for people not used to the humid tropical climate. The TV have many local stations and select cable stations including the Discovery Channel with shows you'd never find in the USA (we are so sick of watching yet another Orange County Choppers show back in the \"states\" and the TV programming is a welcome change.) Breakfast is unforgettable. Anyone who stayed at Rider's Lodge before can attest to the sound of dogs from the training compound right next to the hotel. The food is average, and I don't expect much from complimentary breakfast stuff anyway! For better food, a short walk down the street will take you to the local food court at the bottom of Giant Turf City. For first timers to Singapore, this short walk will give you a taste of what to expect out of the climate. Overall, a very good value for the price. Much better than many hotels I have stayed at in the same price range in the USA.

The taxi will charge this amount, if you call it inside. I would recommend to ask the taxi to wait out and ask the hotel staff to help you to move the luggage. Staff is pretty polite, they helped with electrical adaptors, any transportation needs. The nearest bus stop is 5 minutes away walking.

I was at once impressed and welcomed by the peaceful landscape and the clean lines of the lodge itself. Unlike the common hotel experience, the lobby is more like a comfortable lounge area, with a reception desk where you are seated while checking in. The reception staff are welcoming, courteous and efficient. I had planned on their standard room, but was upgraded to a \"Grandeur\" room at a special rate (S $140 nett). Now compare this to the economy room I stayed in for my first night. That room, in Chinatown, had no window at all. The room had a full-sized bed, but that was about all. As you get out of bed there is just barely room to stand without bumping the wall. Upgrade to a room with a window, but about the same size, is S $125. Internet is available in the lobby only at S $8 per day. At Rider's Lodge, for S $140 nett, I stayed in a spacious room, spotlessly clean, large desk/table with 3'x3' mirror, 32\" lcd tv, 2 comfortable chairs, 2 nightstands with lamps on either side of a kingsize bed with 4 pillows. There is a nice sized closet with an electronic safe for small valuables. The bathroom is spacious enough, good pressure in the shower with electric heater. As the other reviewer commented, the toilet seat is similar to those found in hospitals, but so what? It is comfortable enough, the plumbing was efficient, and there is a personal spray device beside the toilet. And full-length bathrobes are provided. The room has a small mini-bar, apparently for convenience rather than indulgence. Tiger beer is the strongest alcoholic drink provided, but there is a moderate selection of soft drinks, water and snacks. As to location, it's true that it is not really convenient to buses or the mrt. However, this is offset by it's central location. Taxis are readily available by flagging them at the gate or by calling direct. Because of the location, anywhere in Singapore is a relatively low fare. Zoo is $10.20 each way. Lucky Plaza about $7. When that price is offset by 2 or more travellers, and the convenience or door to door comfort, it's really a bargain. I will admit the food at the lodge is not great. Breakfast is adequate if you stick to cereal, toast and juice. If you require more than that I hope you like Indian style dishes,,, I do not but of course that is personal taste only. If you are looking for room service, the alternative here is better than the room service provided by all but the best hotels. Looking on the internet with the fasr, free wifi internet service provided by the lodge, you find that there are dozens of restaurants, providing every style of food imaginable, at the same prices you would pay to eat in at the restaurant. Some deliver for free, some have a small delivery charge, which is always less than it would cost to go there and return. My experience was that the delivery speed and quality of the food equaled or exceeded that of most hotel room service. In summary, I believe this is a largely undiscovered gem of a hotel at a very reasonable price and in a great location. It's not an Oberoi (Bombay) or a Stakis (Scotland), but if you're looking for a quiet peaceful setting (even including the dog training facility next door), wonderful view, clean, spacious room with modern facilities, convenient location, then I highly recommend the Rider's Lodge.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz County, CA", "Title": "\u201cPeace and Tranguility\u201d", "Author": "TashaCat9", "ReviewID": "UR27262637", "Content": "I hope not everyone believe the one review that was rather unfairly written. I almost did. It was once again the time for my annual visit to Singapore. The hotel that I used to frequent during my annual visits was being bought over to make way, for yet another housing project, typical of the Singapore scene. A friend did a search and recommended Rider\u2019s Lodge Hotel. Basing on her recommendation I confirmed my reservation for a stay of 22 days. A day before I was about to leave for Singapore, out of curiosity I decided to check out Rider\u2019s Lodge Hotel reviews on the internet. There were some nice ones, but what struck me was this one review that almost made me cancel the bookings. I went \u2026\u2019Wow\u2019\u2026.what did I get myself into, Twenty -Two days is a long time to be stuck in a place like that. Due to the time difference there was nothing I could do at that juncture. I decided I give it a one night stay and if it was that bad I can always find another hotel, when I am in Singapore. I arrived approximately 2.30am at hotel car-park, within less then a few seconds a porter was there to carry my luggage and less then 5 minutes, my registration of my stay was done. I found the room simply decorated but cosy and vey clean, bathroom was nice too and it touches me to see the little personnel toiletries provided. I like the air condition system because I could adjust accordingly to what temperature I wanted. The mini fridge kept my wine that I bought, cool and chilled Breakfast was included in the hotel package and it was very substantial. Food from room service was fine , it came serve on a plate with necessary utensils brought to me by one of the staff, like any other hotel do. Just across the car park, less then a minute walk was a nice restaurant, that serves breakfast, lunches and dinners and beautiful wine. I did the lunch and dinner there, food was good. The hotel it self as a unique look, the surroundings give a sense of peace and tranquility. The staff and management were absolutely marvelous. Courteous, polite and thoughtful, always a smile and so willing to help. I tried that one night and I stayed for the duration of 22 very pleasant days. I will definitely be coming back there again. I have also recommended some companies in Singapore for their overseas associates and etc. Suan Smith (Mrs) California, USA March 31st 2009", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGood Quiet Place to Escape the Bustle of the City\u201d", "Author": "matilda_chew", "ReviewID": "UR23968380", "Content": "My partner and I had booked a Grandeur room for a night for my birthday. The lodge's in a nice location...just a short 5mins' walk from Dunearn Rd, yet in a quiet corner, so much so that it seems like we were in another place other than the ever busy and bustling Singapore! Our room was nicely furnished and spacious, with a good selection of channels on the TV. The room was clean and well-lit, unlike some of the hotels we've tried for similar prices here! The only drawback would be the very limited selection during breakfast, which we presumed had to be catered from outside, since the lodge doesn't have its own kitchen. Overall an enjoyable stay...with polite staff and a nicely maintained garden. I'd even enjoyed having the sounds of the dogs from the nearby dog training school going on at various points, and didn't find that a nuisance/ hindrance to my rest at all. The lodge is also quite exclusive, having not many rooms, and coupled with the location, it's a nice lil' place to escape the stifles of the Singaporean life minus the overseas expenses. Its decor is conventional, yet maintains the old-world loveliness of its original structure, and what the place was used for in the past.
