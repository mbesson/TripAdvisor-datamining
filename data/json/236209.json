The rules of the hotel permit ANY visitors (though this was not the case 5 years ago). A friend of mine from back in the USA is studying in Barcelona and she was not allowed to come in with us. Also, they will ask you to leave the lobby area after a relatively short time (we were told by one concierge that there is a FIVE MINUTE LIMIT IN THE LOBBY?!?!) Considering that it is the only place we were able to get wifi and communicate with the world we left behind, this seemed ridiculous. The walls are boring and white (though they finally put up some paintings in the lobby be the time we left). The one photo/drawing in our room was not quite pleasant, and the overall experience was not very impressive. The location is great, but for the money you can certainly live better in Barcelona....

A troupe of drummers came marching through the narrow streets, with a large crowd following behind. We stopped to watch, and could not help but be swept up in the moment. The beat was mesmerizing. Later, back in our room, we heard the drumming approaching again. We stepped out onto our tiny balcony, and were entertained for the next hour by an amazing procession of dragons and drummers.

The bathroom was also small, but included all of the amenities. The breakfast was OK, nothing special. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful.

The church of Santa Maria del Pi was right outside of our room. We were within easy walking distance to Las Ramblas and the Barcelona Cathedral, and a Metro stop was nearby. This is definitely a no frills hotel, but IMHO well worth the money. Would definitely stay here again, and plan our stay around the festival.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cJardi Hotel would make a fabulous youth hostel\u201d", "Author": "StevieDG", "ReviewID": "UR86587623", "Content": "We had high expectations of the Jardi. I blame the website. The history page and exterior shots elude to a comfy, historic boutique hotel in the heart of town. And indeed, the hotel is very old. Its just that the present owners ripped out all of the history and charm, leaving a promising exterior and an interior that is combination youth hostel and high school cafeteria. We *tried* our best to like it. But it was simply charmless. Furthering the youth hostel ambiance is the lack of any service whatsoever. You can get breakfast but that's really it. There is no lunch or dinner or restaurant. To do laundry you have to take your load down a small nearby alley to a laundry service. And while the student staff are all very kind indeed, the night manager is a gruff old fellah who seems to resent guests interrupting his nightly TV. We stayed in three different rooms. The highly priced terrace suite (and we can also blame the names for assuming the rooms are big) was just smaller than a Japanese love hotel room. The exterior suite was big enough for a double bed with a second single bed tucked in the corner, which would be good for a small family or a couple with a drunk friend. The interior rooms and singles rival cells in the Hanoi Hilton, without the room service. I will say its clean. The linoleum floors shine with spray cleaner. And the walls are adorned with 1 enlarged photo in each room, some with the digital camera date still emblazoned. We can consider the only amenities the towels, since a deposit is required for a TV remote or use of the in room safe. Positives? To kill the pain of the rooms and the charmless interior, and to win back my family's graces, we spent much of our time outside the hotel. And this is where the real win is-- the location is in the heart of the gothic quarter. Cafes, bars, and restaurants abound, as do many small shops and historic streets. Yet the beauty of the neighborhood does not compensate for what is really a misleading hotel. Were it billed as a youth hostel and were the rooms 30 euros cheaper, it would be a great deal and travellers' expectations would be met. If you are looking for the real thing though, a boutique hotel in the old quarter of Barcelona, you'll need to have a look at the Banys Oriental which was what the Jardi pretends to be. One final note: the owners of the hotel are delightful. I had to restrain myself from asking \"why, why did you rip the soul out of this hotel and turn it into an IKEA showroom without furniture?\" I suppose the answer is because they can.", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Donaldsonville, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201ceconomical but so convenient\u201d", "Author": "sanji404", "ReviewID": "UR83256713", "Content": "Hotel Jardi is in a great location.

The a.c. was great and could be moderated to your liking. The t.v. had music channels and a safe was provided with a 20 euro deposit that you received upon checking out. Keep in mind that all of the other hotels we visited did not have a safe. Location: You couldn't ask for better. You will be in the center of it all. You are within a minute of the center of Las Ramblas. There are always people around and it is very safe. Hospitality: All staff are English speaking and exceptionally helpful. Services: There is a shuttle that will take you to and from the airport, similar prices if not better than a taxi, and way more reliable. We only took it to the airport and had a comfortable and safe ride from Tony. Tony was extremely knowledgeable about Barcelona and surrounding areas, friendly and fun to ride with. Contact the hotel about this service! The hotel offers discounted prices on tour buses that go around the city (amongst other services). Definitely inquire about this! VERY FAST WIFI THAT IS FREE! Things you should know before you go: There is one small flight of stairs before you reach reception. If you lack the strength to carry your bags up, ask the service desk for help (as other people may have complained about this). There is a laundry service close by, inquire by the front desk.

Third, the location is really perfect, center of the old city where most cars are not allowed, easily walkable to most sites, very close to the Metro and many bus routes, two blocks from La Rambla, four blocks from the Cathedral, tons of restaurants, bars and shops, situated on three adjoining lovely plazas with outdoor restaurant and bar seating, an art fair on Saturdays, a market in the afternoon and evenings, occasional special events coming through. It was possibly best hotel all around for the money we've ever been. We didn't get the breakfast so I can't comment on that, but I would guess it is not as good as those at a three star hotel.

Then water flowing in the room next door - perhaps a shower...but the icing on the cake was hearing every word in reception as if the person was in the room. Someone asking for directions, saying good-night etc.. Never before have I stayed in a place with sound proofing as basic as this, or should I say non-existent. After finally managing to get to sleep I was woken up by the wake up call for someone next door at 6.30am (see what I mean about basic). Of course then the chairs at the restaurant downstairs started up again and that was it in terms of sleep at this joint. Bang on 11am the manager rung to say we needed to come out, just as we were leaving the room. I've travelled around the world and would rate this as a definite no-go.

So, based on reviews on Trip Advisor and in a recent travel supplement review, we booked into the Hotel Jardi. In short, we got exactly what we had been led to expect from this hotel. The best thing about the hotel is its location and eternally pleasant staff. The hotel is on the lovely Plaza Sant Josef Oriol and although I would not agree with other reviewers who claim the location is quiet, it is not on a main road and it is probably a lot quieter than many other parts of the city. The plaza was charming with plenty options for breakfast within a stone\u2019s throw of base. The hotel offers good value (we paid just less than \u00a3300 for four nights in an external larger double room with a balcony). Now, don\u2019t expect to have space to practice your salsa in these \u2018large\u2019 rooms and the balcony is crowded with two people standing on it, but the location is great, the views are lovely and there is a nice \u2018feel\u2019 about the place.

I would probably suggest that you don\u2019t have breakfast at the hotel \u2013 why would you with so many wonderful options within a five minute walk. Yes, the little square is lovely but why not walk five minutes to the Boqueria Market just across the Ramblas from the hotel and dine like a king with the locals?

Then, here comes the stairs ...and it was not fun, especially if you're lugging off several pieces of luggages!!! Nobody was there to help you either! PROS - The major asset of this hotel is its location. We had a room with balcony facing the courtyard and it was worth paying the extra 6 euros per night to get this room. We watched the hustle and bustle of activities going on at Plaza del Pi from our balcony. It's close proximity to La Rambla and to the Liceu Metro Station is a BIG PLUS. We walk up and down La Rambla, from the Colon statue to Plaza Catalunya. La Boqueria Market is about 5 minutes from the hotel as well. There is also a huge supermarket along La Rambla that have very reasonable prices. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They offer breakfast on site though we never ate there as there are several other places to eat nearby. The cleaning staff cleaned our room on a daily basis. CONS - Our room was VERY spartan. We have the standard double room, and having just stayed in a timeshare facility in Italy prior to coming here....we wanted to turn around and move to a different hotel. The bathroom was very small, especially the shower. My husband feels claustrophobic everytime he takes a shower. For the price that we paid for this hotel, especially since its during the holidays...I could say that it's worth it.

In reading other negative reviews, I feel like we stayed at another hotel! Maybe it's best to stick to rooms on the upper floors? Our room was actually a triple, but there were just two of us in a double bed. When I booked the room originally, they didn't have a room with a double bed and exterior view available. So, I booked an exterior view room with two twin beds. However, about a week after I booked, they called and said they had a better room available and did I want it, which I thought was great customer service! Front desk staff was very nice, and the location is just fantastic. We took the metro very little as so much was within walking distance!", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "uribes", "ReviewID": "UR7641581", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during our trip around Spain. I have to admit that even tough the location of the hotel is excellent, the hotel was not good at all. I had asked for a room with a balcony and a view. They gave us a room in the first floor behind the kitchen overlooking a small plaza. The view was great but we felt the noise from the kitchen and the flushing of toilets all night long. The room also has a strange smell. Since it was on the first floor we could not leave the balcony door open at night for security reasons so we had to use the A/C which was old and noisy. We asked the front desk for a room change but they were not nice at all at the point to not even consider switching us. I had made the reservations with 2-3 months in advance but they did not care. The bathroom was small and the shower door broke. The bed and towels were also bad quality. I would never stay in this hotel again. If this is the only one around for your budget, make sure to ask for a room in the top floors and with a view to the plaza but consider a different hotel first.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New England", "Title": "\u201cgood value, great location\u201d", "Author": "guilford104", "ReviewID": "UR7431907", "Content": "The Hotel Jardi is very basic but clean and very well located.

The location, off Las Ramblas is good and the hotel is right on a lovely little square not far from the Cathedral. There are no bell hops and even though there is a small elevator you still have to get the luggage up to the reception level which is a long flight of stairs. Our room had a small balcony overlooking the square. This is a no frills place but well run and clean. Not for older travellers I would say, the elevator sometimes does not run well and it has 5 floors of rooms.

Near an old church (bells arent loud) & other stores, cafes. Area is safe, off near the main street. Entrance is a bit haphazard as there are steps to climb w/ your heavy luggage. Stairs to elevator even more difficult. Elevator a bit thin but I fit in. Rooms are spacious, a bit cold though as there was no heating in room but extra blankets provided. Walls gruffy & snuffy but not that bad. Floor needs to get a warm carpet but other than that it was a nice place to get back to at night. Bathroom clean & maintained, shower nice. Staff is composed of friendly foreign students who really try to help you w/ city places, maps, sites, etc. (One of them was smoking which was a minus). No noise at all from guests at night or from street. Window is sound resistant, great view of church square w/ cafes. Town market nearby. Metro in vicinity.

We had asked for an external room, but this was not available on the first night. The internal room was clean, but small and definitely nothing to write home about. The external room we had on the second night was lovely. It overlooked the beautiful square and we could look down on the umbrellas and the art display on show on the weekend. The basilica in the square was beautiful and we went to a live performance by a well known Spanish guitarist on the Sunday night. The atmosphere was priceless.

The hotel was very clean but very very small. The location to La Rambla was terrific, a 2 minute walk. Our room was on the 5th floor across from the elevator. This was no problem as it was off season and very quiet. I would imagine that during the \"In\" season it would be not the greatest room to have because of the additional noise from the elevator. We had a small double bed. After we got our 3 suitcases in there was hardly any room to move around. We had a bath with a shower. There was no hairdryer. (I bring my own always) However, they would rent you one for 10E. There was a safe in the teeny closet which also had a fee. There were french doors that opened onto a small square that included a church. Not really any cars. However, the noise that came up from this square ALL night long kept us up most of the night. It was just awful. To get to the lobby of the hotel you have to climb up 24 stairs and carrying 2 carryons and 1 large suitcase was quite the hassle after our cab let us off on La Rambla. We had to walk to the hotel which was only like one block. This was no problem. But the stairs were. Then after checking in, you had to walk up 6/7 more stairs to the tiny elevator. (I am thinking that most elevators in Europe are tiny) There was room for 1 person and 2 carryons/or just two people and no luggage. We had breakfast in the morning at the hotel. Toast, croissant, jam, orange juice(not fresh) and a cup of coffee each. It was 5.50E/person. Since we wanted to do a few minutes of shopping this was the best bet and it was pretty decent. The people in the lobby were very very helpful and friendly. They called a cab for us in the morning and it came right to the door! We were surprised since the night before the driver left us off on La Ramble. Again taking the suitcases down those stairs was a hassle. Would I stay there again, Yes but unless I had a bigger room, only for one night. Ours was a Standard Exterior room for 86E/night NOT including breakfast.", "Date": "November 25, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "el Jardi - Hostal", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d236209-Reviews-El_Jardi_Hostal-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$112 - $145*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Placa Sant Josep Oriol 1</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Barri G&ograve;tic</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "236209", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f1/ca/88/view-of-the-main-facade.jpg"}}
