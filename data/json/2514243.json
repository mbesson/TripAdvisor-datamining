I had a couple of special needs, including having a package delivered to the hotel room, and they called immediately after it showed up and offered to deliver it to my room for me. Given the price, it was a good value. I don't expect 100% of everything I could want for what I paid. The beds were comfortable, and the bathroom and whatnot were always clean. Given the usual size of NYC hotel rooms, this one was actually bigger than average for similar star ratings. There was a \"sleep\" aromatherapy thing that you can apply to the pillow on the bed which was actually helpful. The area was quiet--almost no street noise. Excellent water pressure and heat in the shower. Some things to consider that you should know, but are relatively minor given the price: 1. I'm a girl, and no conditioner in the room. Seems like they could have just provided a small thing of conditioner. Bad hair days in NYC as a result--BYO conditioner. 2. The walls had black scuff marks and some repaired areas of wallpaper. 3. The TV made a horrible shrill sound on some channels. They only had some basic stations (no A&E, History Channel, Comedy Central, Pay-Per-View, etc), and half had the sound. I didn't tell anyone about this, but I bet they would have given me another room if I'd have asked. 4. It's a longer-than-average walk to the nearest (A-C-E) subway, perhaps 10-15 mins. For me, not a big deal. 5. There's a dicey-looking mission with homeless-looking people across the street, but not a lot of people hanging around. 6. No great restaurants or coffee shops or anything right there, have to walk a few blocks. 7. No complimentary breakfast, but there's a coffee maker in the room.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "altoona pa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, value for $, Professional Staff\u201d", "Author": "russellsq", "ReviewID": "UR127095923", "Content": "I have just returned from a two day trip to NYC with my Drama students.

What makes this more surprising is that my husband *called the week before* to confirm, and everything was in order. Partially his fault was that he didn't get an email confirmation or reservation number; apparently, the Gem does not give out such things, so don't be surprised if your plans are changed for you. The nice man at the desk when we checked in said that if there weren't any available rooms for our third day, they would help us with alternate accommodations. When my husband called on Day Two to check on the room status, he was treated very rudely and basically told tough luck, it's your problem, we're tossing you out and find your own new accommodations for tomorrow. Klassy. While I did a thorough bedbug check before we settled in for our truncated stay and everythign checked out fine, the water makes a racket when you turn it on, and when we tried to turn on the heat, it smelled like scorched iron, and then the smoke detector went off. There are no blankets on the bed, so we were pretty cold. The walls are pretty thin, and I could hear every whine of the toddler staying down the hall.

But, beyond that, this 39-room little hotel near Hell's Kitchen isn't all that precious. Here's what shines about the Gem: - good proximity to Times Square and other touristy hot spots - the neighborhood is pretty safe (I went for a late-night stroll and never felt unsafe) - rooms are standard size for NYC (about 150 sq ft) with air conditioning - Wi-Fi is free (slow, but FREE!) and so is the cable TV - the front entrance is inviting with a small terrace-look-alike appeal - rooms have coffee makers with Wolfgang Puck coffee, an iron, and a desk with ample outlets to recharge all your devices ...AND HERE'S WHAT DOESN'T SHINE - my room was dirty, plain and simple (no signs of bed bugs, though!). The bed sheets had some stains on the duvet cover and the bathroom wasn't sufficiently cleaned (found an old receipt from a previous traveler on the floor, tiles and grout in the tub were stained and looked a bit moldy, and the toilet had a dirt ring around the bowl). Thank God I always travel with Clorox wipes. - the room was also a bit worn looking (scratched and peeling wallpaper) with loose fixtures - the air conditioner was very noisy and ran non-stop (it did the job, though) - the staff failed to refresh the room (i.e. clean the bathroom, restock towels, change sheets and all that jazz) during my two-night stay - the \"complimentary\" toiletries were used (the seal was broken on the mouthwash and there was a lovely strand of hair stuck to it. mmm...feel the minty freshness!) Overall, my stay wasn't awful; but it wasn't great, either. If you're seeking a safe place to sleep that's close to the tourist spots and gives you some cool air and a cup of coffee in the morning, the Gem might be right for you. If, like me, you hope for just a little more (like a clean, quiet room, with service and some nearby food options), you might try the competitor up the street. Sorry Gem.

I'd have to say that it's the best rate that I've ever seen for a NYC 3 star hotel but my main concern was that I didn't want any bed bugs. In the first room (604), we did an inspection and I think I found a bed bug nit on the bedspread. In retrospect, the carpet was really worn, the room was well used, and it was very tiny with a king size bed in it, oh, and the AC didn't work very well. The mattress had a cover over it and could not be inspected. We requested another room, the lady at the front was very nice but was reluctant about giving us another room. She said that she would have to check with her manager since we had the special rate since there were no more rooms with a king size bed. We were contemplating whether to drive back to Connecticut or to stay in another hotel. She then gave us another room with double beds. It was much larger and immaculately clean compared to the first room. We did an inspection and did not find anything. The bathroom was super clean and had some of the extras like lotion and mouthwash. The carpet wasn't worn and the room was much much nicer...especially for NYC. In conclusion, the mixed reviews that you are seeing about this hotel....DEPENDS ON THE ROOM THAT YOU GET! The second room that we stayed in was ROOM 201. One other thing that was worth noting, the gentleman that worked on the night shift was very helpful in finding a place for us to eat. It was raining outside and he offered to lend us his umbrella.

I can honestly say (and this is my fault) that on check in I don't frequently read the entire 'fine print' I made a reservation - saw the price that I booked for and would believe that is what it should be. That is not the case here at the GEM. One of the more entertaining room charges that is purportedly on the 'reservation card at check in' is a $2 charge for the room safe w/ltd warranty. I have never had a hotel where I stayed charge for this outside of the room rate - in reality I have never used the room safe. $2 is not a large amount but the principal is that this is not a charge that should exist. This hotel seems to have shifted from having mini-bars (which would not fit in the room anyway) to charging for items in the room that are not requested or would generally never be considered something that you should have to verify there is or is not a charge for.

The neighborhood that the GEM is in is not horrible, but it's not fantastic either. I never felt unsafe returning to the hotel even very late at night -- but I'm a tall guy with a confident walk, you're experience may vary. It's just about 3 blocks away from Penn Station but you do have to cross the entrance / exit from the Lincoln tunnel to get there. There are signals though so it's not like you are running across an open highway (there are also ways to get around this by going a block out of your way in either direction). Though it's close to Penn Station - I didn't find it to be a horrible walk up to Times Square (about 6 blocks up and 3 over) or over to Herald Square where the Macy*s is. The rooms were not huge (most in NYC are not), but they were comfortable. Had a very nice size king bed with room to walk-around both sides, a desk and small wardrobe. If someone was sitting at the desk it would be very difficult to walk between bed & desk. The bathroom was a decent size and included basic amenities (soap, shampoo, body wash). The room and bathroom were both very clean. The free high-speed internet was a plus -- they have both wireless and wired. I had trouble connecting to the wireless at first and it could be a little spotty at times, but never had trouble with the wired ethernet as a backup. The room also included an in-room safe, iron & coffee maker. The only of which I used was the iron, but there was no ironing board. I didn't feel like calling the front desk, so I just made due on the desk the one time I ironed. The staff was what I would expect from a mid-priced hotel -- not over the top, but not lacking in service either. Every time I came in I was greeted with a hello. My room key did de-magnetize twice and both times they immediately re-magnetized it for me. Other than that not much interaction with the staff. The cleaning staff did a great job - I actually only saw them in the hall one day (I think everyone else on the floor had checked out and they were getting an early start), but my room was always cleaned and made up by the afternoon.

This hotel is an uncomfortable distance (in psychological terms) from the outskirts of Chelsea and the OK areas of 36th and 6,7,8th Aves in Midtown.

I was also concerned about security- no doorman, no key card entry to the hotel OR the elevators OR the stairways. I felt so sorry for the the family with 3 children checking in behind us- international travelers, struggling to push and pull their bags thru the door with no offers of assistance, and probably no choice but to stay here for at least this one night.

They are billed as a \"Botique Hotel\" and certainly fit the bill as much as a chain can be considered a \"Botique\". The place is very bare bones and minimal, yet very stylish and modern. They just give you the very basics of what you need and not much else, but the price reflects that. So it's hard to complain. There are 10 floors and approximately 4 small rooms/floor. It's not the kind of place I'd spend a whole week because it's rather small, has limited storage, and very few of the \"extras\" you'd need for an extended stay. But for staying a night or two in NYC when you just need a place to sleep and shower it does just fine. I forgot to take photos this time, but as of today the photos the hotel has provided on various travel websites are fairly accurate. You just have to take a close look at them to see how small the space really is and understand that the photos really show the WHOLE room. There's not much cropped out! BATHROOM: Clean, basic, and modern. It was pretty much a standard hotel sized bathroom, even though the main room was small. BEDS: Two double beds. Very comfortable, leaning towards the soft side of hotel beds. Sheets were clean and more modern/stylish than you'd find in most chain hotels. BILLING: Reserved via choicehotels.com only a few days ahead of time. The front desk had no problems getting us checked in, and the taxes/surcharges only added up to another 16% of the cost of the room itself. BREAKFAST: There is free coffee/tea in the room, but i never looked for a continental breakfast. There were vending machines in the basement with the ice/water machine. CLEANING: The room was as clean as it gets. While the building is obviously old, it seems that the entire interior is brand new. CLIMATE CONTROL: There was a brand new heater/air conditioning unit that was very quiet and easily adjustable. ELEVATORS: One main, new looking elevator in the lobby. It worked just fine and was fairly large. FRONT DESK: The front desk was helpful and competent. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a room to be cleaned. They may have had the smallest, most basic lobby i've ever seen in my life. But if you're looking for water fountains and gold trim you're not going to get it in a hotel with sub-$200 rates! GYM: None. HOT TUB: None. INTERNET: Didn't try it. I was too busy enjoying the city. LOCATION: On the west-side on 36th very close to the corner of 10th. It's a much more sparsely populated and quiet area than most of Manhattan, as it borders on more of an industrial zone. However, it's only a few blocks to Times Square, Penn Station, and Madison Square Garden. It's a block from the entrace to the Lincoln Tunnel. It was nice to be so close to everything, yet just off the \"beaten path\" in a calmer area. There's a gas station on the corner (one of the few in Manhattan) and a few other random bodegas and restaurants nearby. NOISE: It's NYC, there's always going to be some noise, but there was nothing excessive. Lots of trucks roll down 10th avenue at night, but they mostly just blended into the background. PARKING: None. It's best to find a park & ride outside the city and take a train in. Penn Station is just 2 short blocks and then 2 long blocks away. POOL: None. RECREATION: None. RESTAURANT: None, but it's New York. I'm sure you can find something to eat. For the less adventurous, I did notice a McDonald's on 10th, just a short walk from the hotel. ROOM: The room was small and there wasn't much room around the beds. I'll admit, for 3 people, it was a bit cramped. If you like your space I'd limit occupancy to 2 or find another, bigger, hotel. There was limited storage, just one small wardrobe with 2 drawers underneath, a small nightstand, alarm clock/ipod player, desk, desk chair, and flat screen TV. Again, the decor was very modern. SHUTTLE: None. STORE: None on site, a gas station on the corner, several bodegas nearby. SUPPLIES: Standard Soap, Shampoo, Conditioner, Mouthwash & Towels. ===== ===== ===== RATING NOTE: My ratings are generally based on value vs money. Thus, sometimes a simple hotel will receive a 4 or 5, while a fancy hotel can rank a 1 or 2 if I don't feel it was worth the cost. Also, a hotel can do everything right and still only rank as a 4, unless there's something really exceptional about it. 5 = Hotel gets everything right, and goes above and beyond. 4 = Hotel gets everything right. 3 = Hotel is acceptable value for money spent. 2 = Hotel isn't worth the money spent. 1 = Hotel should pay ME to stay there.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, VA", "Title": "\u201cGirls Weekend\u201d", "Author": "VAOldGirl", "ReviewID": "UR22750957", "Content": "The Gem Hotel is in a great location if you plan to journey uptown and downtown during your stay.

Arrival: I walked from Port Authority Bus terminal down 9th avenue to 36th, maybe 15 min walk with my medium-size backpack. Friendly little grocery around 9th and 36ish on left-hand side, handy for juice, water, fruit. Neigbourhood cons: certainly a working neighborhood, bustling, small, noisy, dusty, gritty, few fancy stores - but as a solo middle-age female traveller, I felt very safe during the day - lots of pedestrian-car traffic, altho at night I'd probably take taxis if going to plays. Still worthwhile to walk around and get a feel for the working pulse of this area on top of the Garment district. Wished I'd taken some time to just sit in one of the litte Italian cafes on 9th but at the end of a long day just too tired. My feeling is this area will undergo gentrification eventually as the city seems to be in a frenzy of construction. Hotel: First, let me qualify that I am a city dweller used to noise so that doesn't bother me much. I look for cleanliness, sleep-worthiness, air conditioning (a must!) and easy access to sites I want to visit. With that in mind, this little place suited my needs more than perfectly and had many nice touches. Entry is back a bit from the street (I expected to see the canopy jutting out) so don't worry - it is there. Pleasant entry and lobby. Highlights: very very clean small air-conditioned bedroom (803-nil view if that matters to you) and spotless bathroom; stylish attractive minimalist black-white decor with just a splash of red, comfortable kingsize bed and simple white linens - lots of lovely squishy pillows. A quiet, cool pleasant retreat after the non-stop city bustle and heat. Flatscreen great (I want one now). Nice luxury touch were the bathrobes. A very handy iron, ice bucket, small safe - didn't use, coffee-tea maker, 2 phones & clock radios. No in room tourist info, not a big deal as some of that was downstairs. The interior and exterior noise level minimal so that was no bother, altho the room fan is quite loud (you can always turn it off). Shiny-white bathroom great , showers were bliss after a day inhaling city grit; the Natura products are very nice - lots of clean towels (and how nicely presented - someone has a touch of style). A morning paper there for your reading pleasure in the morning. Staff: all very friendly and accommodating from deskfront to cleaning staff. Very pleasant to deal with. Access to sightseeing-city transport:: Excellent. I found city blocks quite short but do get a metro card, I just about died in the heat walking from The Museum of Natural History back to the hotel - way too far! Basically - I loved it, for a single it really was a delightful gem, more than exceeding my expectations. Highly recommended and I'd definitely, definitely stay there again. .", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cThe Gem is a gem...\u201d", "Author": "pdonov54", "ReviewID": "UR19485227", "Content": "A great place to stay.

I apologize that this was so long winded, but the details are important. I want to make sure that no one else gets treatment like we did. The hotel was wonderful, but I\u2019m not sure it was worth all the stress it has caused. Our original plans had us staying in this hotel for 4 days, because of an amazing rate we had found through Hotels.com, and then switching to a different hotel for the remaining 5 days of our trip. Therein started the money problems. I received a letter from the Gem Hotel two weeks before our check-in date saying that the pricing we had been quoted was incorrect, and would not be honored. I of course panicked as there was no way I would be able to find another hotel anywhere near our price range on such short notice (we were staying over the 4th of July weekend). I was greatly relieved when the manager offered me a rate that was acceptable for both of us. At this time I informed the manager (Javier) that although the first day of our reservation was the 2nd we would not actually be arriving in New York until early on the 3rd, but I wanted to ensure that we would be able to check in as soon as we got to the hotel since we were traveling across the country. He said he would make a note of this and everything would be fine. Javier then informed me that he would be canceling my reservation with Hotels.com, and booking the reservation with the hotel directly in order to give me the correct rate; my refund was supposed to be in my account by the end of the week, it was not. Frantic (keep in mind we\u2019re now 1 week away from our check-in date) I called for Javier, left several messages, and 4 days later received a returned call. Javier eased my worries by saying that he did cancel the reservation with Hotels.com, and my reservation with the hotel still stood. At this time I again reiterated that we would be checking in early on the 3rd (I was so paranoid about being stranded with no hotel) and he said that he did have this noted. He also said he would contact Hotels.com to find out about my refund, and would call me back. This first phone call was the ONLY one that Javier made to me; every other time we spoke was because I called him. The day we left for New York I still did not have my refund, but I figured since I was going directly to the hotel we could sort things out there. We got to the hotel tried to check in, and was told no, that we did not have a reservation because we did not check in on the 2nd, and there were notes that said I had to check in on the 2nd or my reservation would be canceled. After explaining everything to Vanessa, she booked our room at the promised price. The hotel itself was wonderful. The room small, but I expected that. The AC was great, loved the flat screen TV on the wall, the bed was comfy, the water pressure not so great, but I learned why on one of our tour buses. The location was perfect, we walked practically everywhere! We in fact loved it so much that we decided to stay in the hotel for the entire duration of our vacation. We made another reservation with Margarita (I\u2019m spelling it wrong and I am so sorry on that) she quoted us the rate that was more than what we were paying for the first 4 nights, but again we loved it so much that it was worth it. When we checked in with Vanessa for the remainder of our stay, she confirmed the same rates that Margarita had given us (and kept us in the same room so we didn\u2019t have to pack again, to unpack, thank you for that!). During all of this I had still not received my refund that had been promised by Javier, I had even spoken with him directly, he said he would call me back, and he did not, ever. Come check out day of our wonderful New York vacation, and the amount they try to charge us is $300 more than what we had been quoted. We were told that we had no choice, they had to charge the amount due, even if it was incorrect and deal with the manager directly (knowing how well this has worked out in the past, since I still do not have a refund at this time, we try to find another way) the clerk (sadly I did not get his name, but I really want to say Scott) says that if we come back to speak to the person who made the reservation something can be done at that time. So we wait, come back to the hotel to speak with the person, and she says that she can\u2019t do anything and we have to speak to Javier. We leave, frustrated beyond belief. Our trip ended on such an unhappy note, it did not ruin it by any means, but it left a sour taste in my mouth. We get back home, Margarita calls me, tells me that Javier approved the refund of the difference of what we were told, and what we were charged, and we should see the credit by the end of the week. Friday rolls around, no refund. The following Monday we call, speak to Javier, who tries to say that he will issue the refund, but it will only be $75 because of taxes, and things. Did you ever hear of taxes being $225? For the 5 days the taxes only came out to $76! So here we are 6 weeks after the fiasco started with the incorrect rates published at hotels.com (and every other booking website available, because trust me, I checked them all before booking) and still no refund.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aguadilla, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cThey could not have been Beter!\u201d", "Author": "crubinan", "ReviewID": "UR17881205", "Content": "Loved my stay.
