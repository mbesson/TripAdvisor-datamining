Room was very basic, though we did request a first floor room (and got it). Could hear the people above 'moving furniture'! We were a bit disappointed initially to find the bed was really saggy with springs that made sleeping uncomfortable. To her credit, the Irish owner Clodagh was very grateful to us for bringing this to her attention and promised to replace it as soon as possible, which she did. She left a beautiful vase of tulips in the room to say sorry. Making up the room was forgotten on several occasions. Take your own shower gel as this is not provided (would it cost much to include this?). Breakfast was plentiful in buffet style - salami, boiled eggs, cheese, ham, breads, fruit juice, tea, coffee, fresh fruit, in a pleasant airy room. Staff were wonderfully courteous and helpful. We both felt safe in the hotel and the district in which it was situated. Tram 1 to town and central station stops right outside station - very handy. Best buy is a 24 hr ticket 7.50 Euro (can also get a 48 hr version). Supermarket under hotel very useful as others have pointed out.

I didn't realize the shared bathroom is basically one bathroom, shared with another room, which is this case was 3 guys. I thought it would be bigger with a few stalls and showers. But no. Even at least 2 of each would have been helpful, but then I guess they'd have to put all males and females in the sharing rooms. Made it a little hard to get in there to shower in the morning. We ran out of toilet paper the second day, fortunately my travel mate had a roll. We didn't leave it in there, don't know what those guys did. The bathroom got kind of gross by the second day or so, and the staff didn't really tidy it up and the paper was never refilled. Definitely remember shower shoes. The drain in the shower was slow. No wastebasket in there. The room itself was small but had what you needed. Not the cleanest but I've seen worse. Not too bad for the money. We faced out on the street. It was kind of noisy but really not too bad. You could hear the tram running but it wasn't a really populated area so not too much people noise. The tram flashes lights with the overhead cables sparking, so that might be a problem for some. My travel buddy mentioned this but it didn't bother me. The tram is right in front of the hotel so that is very convenient. Quick to get around in this city. It's great that this is above a little grocery. Very convenient, stop in and pick up some bottled water and snacks. Also, they put on a tiny surcharge for plastic water bottles for the deposit. It's like 50 cents. Cashier explained to me when I looked confused as to why it cost more than the sign on the shelf said. There's a machine towards the back of the store where you can bring back the empties and get your refund. It won't take crushed bottles though, as I found out. Breakfast is good, it's better to get there on the early side. Breads, sliced cheese and ham, boiled eggs, jams, cereal, coffee, juice. It's a small space when many people are trying to get food, and things run out, though the staff was very busily trying to keep up replacement. Staff pretty friendly, nice enough. It was a pretty good deal overall and if I went back to Amsterdam, I think I might stay here again if I didn't want to try out another section of town.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest Amsterdam budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "3180256", "ReviewID": "UR121514637", "Content": "Tv in room, balcony, smoker friendly, really polite staff, great location next to vondelpark. 1min walk to Leidseplein, 3min walk to museums.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cCheapest Decent Place\u201d", "Author": "chidem", "ReviewID": "UR120981887", "Content": "We have been to Abba 3 times for now and never got disappointed.

It is also located right across the street from a tram station, which makes traveling simple and easy. The nightlife area, Leidseplein, is only a 10 minute walk away. All other locations are a quick tram right away as well. The best part of Hotel Abba would have to be its staff. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, even giving advice and warnings about how much is too much to pay for certain items. My only complain?

We found the hotel very easily as we got tram 1 from Central Station and it stops right outside the front door (the stop after Leidesplein). We had arrived early and hoped to leave our bags in their luggage room until our room was ready, but we were told it was and we could check in then (about 11am) rather than at 3pm, which was great. Our room (#77) was on the second floor and faced the courtyard so was nice and quiet. (Some overlook the main road at the front and are noisier.) It had two twin beds in it, and private ensuite facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was basically a small cupboard with a toilet and shower in it, plus a wash basin in the bedroom itself. The bathroom smelt quite damp but there was no sign of this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was all very clean, just a bit short of space if you need to get dressed in there! The only drawback was that no towels were provided. Had we known this, we would have brought some but there is no mention on the website or the site we booked through. Having paid far less in other cities and always had towels provided, it just hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crossed my mind that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide them.

Even so, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something I had planned to spend my holiday money on!) The hotel is on the first, second and third floors of the building, and the stairs are very steep and curved, so you need to take care, especially if you have luggage to carry up (as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no lift). Having said that, I read about them on here beforehand and they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as I expected! On the ground floor is an Albert Heijn supermarket, which was brilliant, especially the bakery. (We got things to take out for a packed lunch, and drinks for our room.) Breakfast is a typical continental affair served from 8-10am, but everything is fresh and kept well topped up so there is plenty for everyone. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-service so you can have whatever you want. The breakfast room is bright and sunny with window boxes overlooking the street on the first floor. Also on the first floor is a lounge and smoking room. The resident cat also likes to sleep in that room, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very friendly! It seems that most places in Amsterdam have a resident cat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hotels, bars, coffeeshops*\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 - to help with any mouse problem I guess? (*They must have some of the most chilled cats in the world! ;o) ) There was also a TV in our room (although you have to pay a 10\u00e2\u201a\u00ac deposit for the remote control at reception if you want it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it works fine without). The beds were nice and clean, really bouncy and comfy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we slept soundly. We also had a private balcony with doors both to our room and further doors to the outside, which was handy when it rained. Even though it was May, it was quite cold but the radiators could be turned o/off as we needed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was great for drying our clothes overnight after we got soaked! The staff are helpful and friendly. There was a problem with their credit card machine so we had to pay cash, but there is a cash machine on the ground floor in the supermarket, and a bank just along the road. One evening I managed to lose the key to my case, but only realised this when I got back to my room. Luckily the finial on the end of the bed (bed post) came to my rescue and I managed to break the padlock with it!! So all in all, no major complaints at all. We had been surprised how expensive rooms are in Amsterdam, but given that, this seems pretty good value. Positives: Comfy beds, quiet rooms, good breakfast. Negatives: No towels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or warning about this.

This is the second time I stayed here and also the only place I have ever stayed in Amsterdam so I have nothing to compare it with, but it is more than a good value. Hotel rooms in Amsterdam aren't cheap, however the rates at Hotel Abba are more than fair. I believe I paid 35 euros a night! It certainly isn't fancy, but a great place to crash after a wild day in the Dam. Way better than any hostel, that's for sure. Fairly quiet and a great location. A lot of people like to stay in the Centrum, but the area the hotel is in is pretty nice as well considering it is just a 5 minute walk to the popular Leidseplein area and about a 2 minute walk from Vondelpark. The street it's located on (Overtoom) is a major road so it's easy to access public transportation (tram line 1 stops literally right in front of the hotel). One complaint I here a lot is how steep the stairs are. No kidding?! It's Amsterdam - every place has incredibly steep and narrow stairs so if this is an issue for you (health-wise are just plain laziness) than you don't want to stay here as there is no elevator. The rooms are fairly small, but the do have a TV which is nice at the end of the day. The hotel also has rooms that face an inner courtyard (as opposed to facing the busy Overtoom street) so if you have a choice those rooms are more quiet. They also serve breakfast, which while very basic (bread, sliced meats and cheeses, juice, coffee, etc) is a nice touch as the same breakfast in Amsterdam would run at least $10 so over two weeks I probably saved over $100 easily. Staff is very friendly and helpful as well. The hotel is smoker friendly, which in Amsterdam means more than just cigarettes! To be honest, I never smelled marijuana once though. You are allowed to smoke in your room though, so if you're a prude who doesn't like people who smoke marijuana, than you might not want to stay here - be forewarned. They do ask you to open a window though so as not to set off the smoke detectors. The inner courtyard rooms do have a balcony though, so it's nice to sit out there and smoke a fatty. They do offer wireless Internet, but you have to pay. It was 3 euros an hour, or you could buy a 5 hour card. There isn't a whole heck of a lot of free wireless in Amsterdam. All in all, a great value for the money. Nice location, smoker friendly, breakfast included.

Common bathroom and shower was clean and I never had a problem there. Hotel Abba does have a free breakfast every morning, but I never did end up going down and eating breakfast. Also, a grocery store entrance is located about 5 feet from the hotel's entrance which is very convenient if you don't want to go far (although there is other food on Overtoom) or the weather is bad. I walked throughout my stay in Amsterdam but I do know trams run up and down Overtoom and there is a stop right in front of the hotel.

Fortunately, there is an ATM right by the hotel so you dont have to walk around Amsterdam with a wad of cash. All in all, a decent one star.", "Date": "April 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bavaria, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat low budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Olli85", "ReviewID": "UR4587244", "Content": "We arrived at the central station and went into the the tourist information center.

It was our 6-7th visit in Amsterdam, but first in this hotel. There were some things that we liked but unfortunately the majority of things we didn't like. Obviously, the positive thing was the price. The breakfast was also okey (the same as in any other hotel). TV set in the room was also an advantage. The location of the hotel was also quite good - it's not the strict city center itself but you can get almost anywhere on foot in a short time. Now the negative sides of Abba Hotel. The main problem was the walls: they were so thin that you could virtually hear what the neighbors were wispering. And if you'll have so much bad luck as we had, i.e. having very noisy neighbors, it'd be even impossible to sleep. Next thing - keys. To get to your room you need 3 keys. It is good for security reasons but there was a constant problem with opening the doors, the keys were getting stuck all the time. And after several attempts to get them out it started to be quite frustrating. Another problem: bathroom. It was a shared bathroom (for 2 rooms)& leaving aside a huge fungi on the ceiling, there was a patch of pubic hair on the tiles uncleaned for the entire time we've spent in that hotel!!! Last but not least, to get to the breakfast room, you had to go out on the street and go there using another entrance to the hotel. NOT pleasant in winter time.
