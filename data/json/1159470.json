{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Modern hotel in good location The Waldorf Suite Firenze is in a great location by the trian station and near many of the tourist sites. The rooms are very modern and are suites - some with two separate rooms; others with two sleeping areas separated by double doors. If you are traveling with people, work with the hotel on getting a room to meet your needs. There is a small kitchenette available too. When we were visiting, there was quite a bit of construction going on outside, so it was noisy but tolerable. The bathrooms were fantastic and much larger than normal Italian hotels. We were pleased with the hotel and it met our needs. It was a good home base for our daily activities in Florence.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR882130411", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kank15"}, {"Content": "it's fine We had a long weekend there  it was fine. We had a city view room  because the breakfast room wasn't in operation we had free room service every morning (the other option was to go to the BH Ambasciatori hotel next door, which they also own). It was great, we ate at the big table in the lounge room with a great view over the roof tops to the Duomo  Campanile. The suite itself was large  clean, spacious lounge  seperate bedroom with lots of storage + 2 bathrooms, one with shower  one with shower over nice bath tub. It was clean, simple  modern.

It is situated opposite the main entrance to Firenze SMN railway station. We were a little worried about the noise, but this was never an issue. We had rooms at the back overlooking the bus station. It was pretty quiet from mid evening to about 8 in the morning, and even then the double glazing on the windows provided good sound proofing. When we arrived we had been allocated the wrong sort of room. This was corrected quickly and without argument. The new room (a small suite) had a broken window lock. We reported this and were told it would be fixed whilst we were out at dinner. It wasn't, but it was fixed whilst we ate breakfast the next morning. The staff were helpful throughout our stay, although it shouldn't really be necessary to have to deal with such simple errors and problems in a 4 star hotel. The accommodation was modern and clean. and the hotel is generally in good condition. The quality of the room servicing was also generally good, although after our second night the cleaner decided to turn our twin beds into a double, presumably to save on bed making effort? The location in Florence is good. The hotel is away from the congested centre of town, but you can walk to the Uffizi in about 15 minutes. There are simple but adequate traditional restaurants within close walking distance, and a supermarket less than 100 metres away. Breakfast was good, and although the room used is small, the staff are efficient and you can have a good meal from a good selection. If we visited Florence again, we would choose Waldorf Suites again.", "Date": "Nov 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR851784253", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LawrenceUk"}, {"Content": "Beware.... bed bugs This hotel is located on top of a bus station, with buses running from 6AM to 9PM.

The bathrooms (2) where great one had a jacuzzi and the other one had a great shower. We spent our last night in Italy here and it was relaxing and the only room where we could not hear our neighbors. I would stay here if the hotel stays the same price. Good value for the money, the door said the room rate was 785 euros but we paid only a percentage of that. If this hotel is under 200 euros it is worth it. Downside is that it took us an hour to find in traffic. There is no sign for the hotel and in the middle of a contruction site. If your taking a cab it should not be a problem but if you are driving it is difficult.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR348519064", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BCorr"}, {"Content": "don't come near to this hotell!!!!! we have orderd a Non Refundable room, when we came to the hotel, they make up with some lies, and told us that they don't have rooms and that we have to go to another hotel.we told them that we have orderd it a month ago!!

When we went to check in we were told that we had to stay in a room for the first night, but they would switch us to a suite the next.The room was clean, but the shower was broken. When it was fixed and used it, we found that the water drained so slowly it flooded out of the shower into the bathroom and almost into the bedroom itself. When we got switched to the suite we also found that one of the showers in there was broken. The other shower cubicle door was off its runners. The views out of the window in both the room and the suite were of the bus station. This also meant that loud announcements could clearly be heard from the early morning. Breakfast was okay with a selection of pastries, bread and ham. Staff were very helpful and polite. Overall the stay was okay, but I definitely do not think that it was the 4* experience it should have been.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR911295957", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Yen_8"}, {"Content": "Nice facilities... but felt a bit lonely! The hotel is situated in a modern shop/office block opposite Florence's main train station, Santa Maria Novella (love the name!). Not all that easy to find because it doesn't actually LOOK like a hotel - you enter through a glass door next to a shop, and walk to the end of the corridor where you will find the reception desk. There is nothing there apart from the reception desk - no lobby, no bar, no public area of any kind.My accommodation (a two-room suite) was immaculate - modern furniture, a spacious and well-appointed bathrrom, everything spotlessly clean and well-maintained. My only gripe is that the kitchenette was locked away in a cupboard to which I was not given a key - I don't know if they would have given me the key on request, I didn't bother asking as I was only there for one night.As a place to rest my head the hotel was perfect... but it had a bit of a lonely feel about it due to the lack of public areas (there was a breakfast room, but it was on an upper floor and people didn't tend to hang about there).", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR566363741", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Aviatrix"}, {"Content": "An ideal base for a trip to Florence This hotel is centrally located, right next to the station, which shouldn't put you off, as its not a bad area. Central Florence is very small, and every part can easily be reached on foot from this hotel. It is even possible to come back for a siesta without taking too much time out of your day. The main selling point is that the rooms are all suites, huge, and well appointed. The bathrooms are great, and the decor was done to a high standard, tasteful if a little corporate. As a base for our 4 day trip it was great to have a bit of space, enough to spend an evening in without feeling cramped.Staff were very helpful, booking tickets for the Uffizi and the Accademia, meaning we didn't have to join the enormous queues. Breakfast was very nice, although the hotel does not serve any other meals. On their website, they mention that the rooms have a small kitchen, but don't reveal that one needs to pay EUR 50 cleaning charge to use it. This wasn't really a problem for us though, as we weren't planning to cook. We found a good deal online, and felt that we got great value. Overall an excellent base for a stay in Florence.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR628223490", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Chatto123"}, {"Content": "Totaler Reinfall!   showReview(20773964, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR747298442", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Bianca_hainlein"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d1159470-r23270310-Waldorf_Suite_Firenze-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "1159470", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
