I understand it's a vintage, antique style hotel, but the room was dark, dingy, dirty, stinky, and just overall gross!!!!!! I was only there 1 night and I could barely even sleep. I felt like something was watching me and weird shadows that both and me my bf saw...not sure if this place is haunted or not, but after reading more about it, it was many different hotels and an apartment before the remodel! Creepy!!! The worst part was the next morning, after a night of terrible sleep, the toilet backed up and had feces in it-DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's a fine edifice, certainly, but that's about as good as it gets, apart from the many wonderful pictures of Hollywood Greats from the golden days on the walls of the upstairs corridors. The hotel itself is situated in what is virtually a 100% Hispanic part of LA, and it was difficult to shake off the feeling that, if you're Caucasian, you're only tolerated. The subway is a brisk 30 minute walk away and. from there, you're in Hollywood and the Sunset Strip in less than 10 minutes. The buses take for ever, though. It wasn't much to pay for a hotel room relatively close to Hollywood. However, the carpets are dirty, the rooms (well, mine anyway) shabby and sparsely furnished although, in fairness, the bedding was clean and turned down every day. There are no brochures or leaflets in either the foyer or the rooms to help you decide where best to visit, which should tell you everything you need to know about the general attitude towards guests which, going by my experience, is: you represent income, you're only passing through, and we are not remotely interested whether you come back or not. Fact: the staff were awful. Apart from one young man they were uniformly unfriendly, unsmiling and made not a single effort to make my week's stay a pleasant one. No-one could be bothered to make conversation once, not even to ask if I was enjoying my visit to LA. I'm staggered to read glowing reports on the hotel, and particularly its staff, from supposedly other 'correspondents'. Frankly, I strongly suspect they are posted by the hotel or others with a vested interest. I stayed a week because I had paid in advance. One or two nights will be tolerable - but don't expect hospitality - it's non-existent.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cBED BUGS!!!

We got to Hollywood in the afternoon of April 11th. We decided to check around the neighborhoods of the hotel before we checked in to see if there was anywhere close we could grab dinner and a few drinks. No where close by that seemed safe and sanitary. Therefore, we chose to stay in the hotel that night. On a side night, the parking area was safe and very accessible. The room seemed okay and did have a flat screen tv. When we took showers we realized the towels were dirty and stained so asked housekeeping for a fresh set. Our room had been on the side of the street. This meant we didn't sleep past 7am because traffic was so loud with constant big trucks and ambulances flying by. When we checked out the desk clerk didn't even go as far as saying \"hello\" to us or \"thanks for staying here.\" We decided it was $57/night so whatever. We returned home and nine days later (which was two days before I wrote this review) I woke up with 18 bug bites on my body. I freaked out and googled any possible causes. I read online that it generally takes 9 days for bed bug bites to appear on your body. I then read the reviews of previous guests and read that they also had experienced bed bugs!! I freaked out and sanitized my whole apartment, including washing the clothes i took on my trip three times. I also had more bite marks appear yesterday, which was the 9th night from staying there the last night we did (April 12th). I have yet to actually find that any of the bed bugs had joined me on our travels back. Regardless, I have done everything possible (without calling an exterminator) to prevent these bugs from taking over my apartment). I will be sure to comment back in case I do. Moral of the story, BED BUGS possibilities are not worth the STRESS, ANXIETY, and UGLY BITE MARKS that you may receive from saving a couple bucks to stay at the \"Historic\" (aka old furniture infested with bed bugs) hotel.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYou can't beat the price!!\u201d", "Author": "PollyTiger", "ReviewID": "UR128308553", "Content": "Ok it's cheap accomodaion and not in walking distance but for my partner and I it was brilliant.

We checked in around 11pm and the (young) man at the front desk was great- efficient, a bit friendly but not fake, and accommodating. My husband smokes once in a while and we were considering getting a smoking room but I didn't want to sleep in a stinky ashtray. The clerk offered to show us the room so we ran up the three flights of stairs (there were a few other customers in line behind us and no elevator), I smelled the room, it was fine, we ran back down and we got the room. The room definitely felt like a small efficiency studio where B actors once lived, which means it was pretty large for a hotel room. The bed was fine, tv good, mini-fridge convenient, the toiletries in the bathroom much appreciated and free parking in the back a nice bonus. We may have heard noises from the adjacent rooms but nothing major. We had a view of the automobile repair shop across the street but in the morning we noticed a small peek-a-boo view of the Hollywood sign. There's in room coffee, a vending machine in the \"lobby\" but no ice. If you are a tourist who likes walking (some bus lines nearby and a couple of eateries but more options are available if you walk 1/2 a mile in any direction), or have a car, this might be a good budget option for you.

This hotel has bed bugs, and they admitted they\u2019ve had problems in the past but have always addressed them right away. We moved out of our first room (no bed bugs) due to the noise. The person at the front desk moved us to room 205, and we immediately checked for bed bugs under the sheets. We didn\u2019t find any, but we did see that there was a plastic covering around the mattress--evidence that they\u2019ve had a bed bug problem in the room before. After our first night in the new room we woke up with a ton of bites. Later that day we were watching a movie on the bedspread and I saw a bed bug crawling on one of us. It was a classic bed bug, gorged in blood. We squished it and immediately showed the person at the front desk. He apologized profusely and instantly refunded our money for the rest of our stay, and we got the heck out of there for another hotel. What I would have written had there been no bed bugs: Before you book your hotel here, you need to have the appropriate expectations of what you\u2019re getting. What you will get is: cheap accomodations akin to a college dorm room or hostel; hairdryer only upon request; shabby bed spread but generally clean sheets that may have a few spots; stained desk chair seat; generally old decor and furnishings; stark white tile bathroom that\u2019s a little grungy but still \u2018clean\u2019; no central heat--they have a plug-in heater in every room; nice flat screen TV; internet that can be spotty. If you go in with these expectations, and the fact that you\u2019re only paying something like $65/night for Los Angeles, then you will be fine. I would recommend requesting a room facing the parking lot, since the windows are extremely thin and if you get a room facing the road you will hear loud traffic all night.

Of course, there are some downsides too, as with all places. No elevator, small bathroom and thin walls but these are all honestly very bearable & after a day, you won't even think about it.

It's about 40 minutes by foot from Hollywood and Highland (the downtown Hollywood area - Graumann's, Walk of Fame, etc) and the walk is not through the safest neighbourhoods.

The stay in the hotel (particularly in the morning) was perforated with conversations and furniture movement in the hallways by the staff. A smell of paint lingered as they redecorated. On our second day the maid forgot to even tend to the room. In the late afternoon/early evening someone came by to drop off new towels, with no mention of why the room was un-made. Ten minutes later another set of towels were offered, again no mention. When it was obvious nothing would be done and the facilities needing restocking we complained to the desk clerk. He was almost insistent that it was our fault for having the \"do not disturb\" sign up - even though we didn't have a \"do not disturb\" sign in the room and had been out all day. Overall we weren't impressed. The wireless internet is only ok and the cable tv is good - when it works (although this might be a complaint against the cable company, not the hotel). For what we paid it was average. In our next hotel (Anaheim) we paid less and got better.

I mean, how good can a $50 a night room in Hollywood be? But after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did. Here are my impressions, and responses to some of the negative comments I've read from others: Location- It's very centrally located. If you're a tourist, you're only a few minutes from lots of main attractions. To those who complained because they didn't have a rental car...are you crazy? It's LA for heaven's sake, you're GOING to need a car! I rented one for 5 days for $108, and that was at an expensive airport location. Use a little of the TONS of money you're saving by staying here and rent a car! As for neighborhood safety, I am a female traveling alone and I felt very safe. You just have to use common sense like in any big city. Restaurants- To those who said there's nowhere close to eat, I just don't get it. In addition to the Italian place already mentioned, there are 2 excellent Mexican restaurants within 2 blocks. And if you have a car, there are literally dozens of restaurants within a 3 minute drive. Be adventurous, people! Building- VERY cool, especially from the outside as you can see. All the old Hollywood pics are fun. The view of the Hollywood sign is great. As others have said, there is no elevator. I could care less, personally. I stayed on the top (3rd) floor and welcomed the run up the stairs after dinner! It's not luxurious, but still nice and not run-down feeling. Amenities- Free parking! If you've spent any time in LA you know this is HUGE! And free wi-fi! Mine worked perfectly in room 315, not sure why others had problems. There are fridges in the rooms, another great perk. No restaurant or room service. No ice machines, just snack and drink machine in lobby. Basic cable. Rooms- Somewhat sparse but quite comfortable, medium-sized room. The bedspreads and curtains were a little threadbare, as others have noted, and the sheets and towles were not the highest quality, but they were snowy white and spotlessly clean. I received clean towels and linens each day. I slept well on my bed. No outlet in the bathroom, but it was not a problem for me. I always had a place to plug in my laptop and phone charger, too. The only furniture was bed, nightstand, desk w/chair, and TV cabinet/dresser combo. Fine for just one but might need more seating for 2. Large closet with hangers. WIndow A/C, portable heater (I didn't need either). I was on the street side of building and loved it for the view of the hills, H'wood sign, and street action, but if traffic noise bothers you get one in back for sure. Bathroom had good water pressure and was very clean. Staff- I had limited interaction but they seemed very friendly and helpful. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for bargain shoppers, adventurers, and city-lovers. It's not for the lazy, disabled (lack of elevator), unimaginative or spoiled. I was amazed at the excellent value. I don't think I would have been any happier at most of the places that charge triple what it cost to stay here. I will DEFINITELY return, and send my friends here.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cgreat deal\u201d", "Author": "sha598", "ReviewID": "UR104162943", "Content": "I was wary based on both other reviews and because I know there are several run down motels in the area, but this place was great for the price.

There was a very old elevator from years ago that is not used now. Once in the room at first glance it looks OK. We had a king bed. It was fairly comfortable. The closet was only about 1 foot wide but was enough for hanging clothes. It could not hold the luggage. There was a fridge and portable heater if it got cold. The curtains and bedspread are old so we took the bedspread off the bed and put it in the drawer. The skirt around the bottom of the bed was ripped and needed to be thrown out. The towles in the bathroom were old and small. They did supply the regular shampoo and soap. The tub was the original and had been resurfaced. The water pressure in the shower was fine. Very small bathroom but it worked. There was no electrical outlet in it. Back into the main part of the room I think there was only 2 electrical outlets total. One had a power cord and had the fridge and other things plugged into it. We plugged our laptop into it but had to be careful not to trip over the cord. The table you are suppose to put the laptop on was on the other side of the room and the cord did not reach. Actually the table was so close to the bed you could not put a chair at the table anyway. Oh yeah, did I mention there was not a chair anyway. There is no phone in the room. The only place to sit was on the bed. We used the place just to sleep anyway. We would walk up Melrose to Western and go right to Hollywood in about 15 minutes. The area is very seedy but Very convenient. Since we found there were really no decent places to eat near the hotel we ate before returning to the hotel. It is not a place I would like to have a toddler crawling around on the carpets.

There's a tv with loads of channels, a fridge and a coffee machine. I was at the back on the car park side (room next to the stairs on the first floor) but it was very quiet at night and I got a great nights sleep. For $49 per room this is well worth the stay, it's a bargain and much better than you would expect. The Italian a few doors down by the way is amazing and cheap ($18 for a main) and it must be good coz Tony Bennett was sat behind us. Otherwise, there is not much in dining terms around.

With $49/night, parking overnight is also included (free of charge).

The room was gorgeous! Huge tv, fridge, lovely ensuite. Couldnt fault it in the slightest! Location was ok, we were only there for two nights and spent most of our time in Hollywood. We walked alot (45mins to the chinese theater), but if i was going back to LA Id look abit more into public transport as distances are deceiving when walking!

Based in Melrose Avenue there are several main bus routes which can take you to West Hollywood, Downtown and Venice Beach. The rooms in the hotel were what you pay for a king size bed, plazma cable tv, big closet, bathroom (which includes bath, sink & shower), empty mini fridge to fill at your leisure, air con, and a hot water kettle with complementary tea & coffee. There is no room service available as there is no kitchen/dining area within the hotel but they do offer a room service menu where you can order delivery service from some of the local food outlets. The rooms are made up daily and one thing I thought was very good was the at the back of the do not distrub sign there was a sign for the maid to come in & make up your room ASAP which meant your room was priority. The staff were not overly friendly nor ignorant when asked a question by myself or my girlfriend they were always happy to help, and not rude but at the same time they seldom said hello when you walked in after your day or night out which would suit some people perfectly. Overall I would definately stay in this hotel especially if I were driving as the only thing the location lacked was a good bus route directly into Hollywood and some proper restaurants within walking distance and the only thing the hotel lacked was a swimming pool & dining area and one of the main things there is NO lift in the hotel but the staff were happy to lug our suitcase up the 3 flights of stairs", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London UK", "Title": "\u201cA superb low cost hotel with easy access to the sights of LA\u201d", "Author": "J0hnlav", "ReviewID": "UR78725136", "Content": "We had a very happy stay at the HOLLYWOOD HISTORIC HOTEL.

From what I understand, this hotel was recently remodeled by new owners, and they did a great job of turning this old place into a truly historic hotel that I'd love to stay at again. Pros: Clean and nicely decorated with old movie star photographs down every hall. Wonderful service. Everyone at this hotel is helpful and courteous. Good room for the price. A little small, but it's more cozy than anything else. Nice TV and a fridge. Free parking and they have a guard outside at night to protect your car. Gas station right across the street (fairly cheap too). Cons: West Hollywood is a little sketchy place, but I felt very safe at the HHH and had no serious problems or concerns. It is an older hotel, so you probably won't want to stay hear if you don't like that sort of quaint charm. Walls are somewhat thin. Plumbing can be loud, especially from the rooms above you.
