Hotel San Giovanni was a great location at a great price. As other hotels said, this is a no-frills place. Breakfast is not included, but that is not a big deal because there are plenty of shops around. And of course, since you are in Florence, you aren't staying in your room much anyway!The view from our room was fabulous - you could see the Duomo! The ceiling was high which made the room feel large and airy. Our bathroom was across the hall but we had a sink in our room. Three of us (twenty-something girls) stayed in one room and there was plenty of room for our stuff and even a small table. The sheets were clean - our only complaint would be the quality of the towels provided. I'd bring my own in the future.Everything in Florence is in walking distance from the hotel, including lots of restaurants. There is no internet access here, but there are many internet cafes close to the hotel as well.", "Date": "Apr 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR318416542", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lallamarquez"}, {"Content": "Great location, average hotel       Procession going by below our hotel room window", "Date": "Nov 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR580755846", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SuzanneD_001"}, {"Content": "I got bedbug bites here!!!

I had a problem with another hotel keeping my drivers license and if not for San Giovanni, I would never have gotten it back.It is NOT Ramada Inn or Best Western or room service w/ a view -- This is a trip to Europe, not the 50 states of the U.S. There is a bit of funk to the rooms, but some of them have ceiling frescoes and the place is very clean.
