That said, let me start by saying that I am also basing this review on value. W hotels are supposedly the chic, upscale Starwood brand (more hipster, less expensive than the St. Regis). This hotel had a fun clientele, and a buzzy downstairs, but the rooms were kind of awful. The bathroom was dated. I am sure it was cute in 1980 (or whenever it was built) to have the peek a boo bathroom, but it just feels tired and looks even worse. It's no more luxurious than a Holiday Inn. The bed was fine (not sure if it was the Heavenly Bed), but it was just a very basic room (with a good view if you go high enough). For some reason, they put a very shaggy/hairy cube on the bed spread. I am not sure what one is supposed to do with this cube as it provides no function and it is full of dust. The whole room felt like it was stuck in another time period. On a much better note, the staff was top-drawer. Very pleasant overall and they will run up a coffee maker to your room with a smile.

The location was good, only about 5 or 10 minutes walk from Michigan Ave, and right next to Navy Pier. The Acura shuttle was a nice service, they took us to Shedd Aquarium, strollers and all, free of charge. That saved 1 way's cab fare, and we decided to walk along the lake shore on the return trip (took about 45 minutes). The rooms were nice and well maintained, and beds were comfortable. They're not huge rooms, but fine for a big city and big enough for us. There is a shutter between the room and bathroom (Westin Ft Lauderdale Beach Resort is the same way), which I guess bothers some people but I thought was fine. It does allow more noise out of the bathroom than normal, and I'm sure some people find that awkward, but with my kids there's no such thing as privacy anyway. The staff was friendly and promptly accomodated my requests. My only issue was I requested a few things via the W Hotels iPhone App, and after waiting an hour didn't recieve anything. I talked to the front desk and had my requested items in under 5 minutes, so probably the app isn't ironed out yet, not a hotel problem.

Room was nice, view of the Lake and Navy Pier was awesome. Was originally put in a room by the elevator and it was very loud. There was no problem at all in switching rooms. Beds were very comfortable. They have a great, cool-looking bar. Courtesy car to take us to dinner was convenient (no return ride is available though). It's obviously sponsored by Acura because they run an Acura commercial while you are riding and have a Acura questionnaire for you to complete. It saved us a taxi fare though! And to be honest, I would now consider Acura when we are ready to purchase a new car...loved the car! Cookies and hot apple cider in lobby were a nice touch. All staff were kind, courteous and helpful. My only reasons for \"very good\" vs \"excellent\" are: 1) They have a \"window\" with shutters that opens up from the bedroom to the bathroom and a sliding door to the bathroom. It is a nice touch that helps to open up the room more. However, it does limit your bathroom privacy because they don't shut tight and you can easily hear any sound coming from the bathroom and the bed is right on the other side of the shutter. If I was sharing a room with a non-family member, especially if sharing with a business associate, it might be a bit awkward. 2) The comforters on the beds are not inviting.

The W line also is typically modern and trendy - we're more old-world romantic, and not usually dressed like we're heading for a photo-shoot. We recently stayed at the W Chicago Lakeshore on a business trip for my husband/vacation, and we can say that this W is still modern and trendy, but very comfortable and a place we'd most certainly stay again. The hotel staff was amazing and never once did anyone make us feel awkward about having our son with us - they actually helped very often with making traveling with him a little easier (a few names that we collected that were exceptionally helpful: Nicholas Baes, Amy Miller, Robert Shumate, Ashley Sarpong). Our room was a great size, nice view of the city, quiet, clean ... only complaint would be the lack of soundproofing/privacy with the bathroom. Because of the wooden shutter-covered opening and thin wooden sliding door (we could easily have a conversation from the room into the bathroom with shutters and door closed), showers in the morning woke my son up. I would believe that people with allergy sensitivities or general frangrance issues could be bothered by the various scents of the shampoo, soaps ... one is a bit lime-like, another earthy, and one smelled like bubble gum to me :o) We don't usually have our room refreshed as my son's toys take over our room, and it's just easier so he can nap whenever, but housekeeping was kind and helpful whenever we needed assistance. Location is very nice - view of lake is gorgeous, walk to Navy Pier and little beach and park by lake is short (did need stroller, though) and lovely, and walking to restaurants, shopping, touristy areas is reasonable.

I stayed in this property 11/27 & 28, 1970 (don''t ask how I remember,) when it was the Lake Tower Inn. Then I stayed a couple of times in the mid-1990's when it was a Days Inn. Now, it's the \"W.\" I'm sure the decorations and layout are very \"New York.\" Don't get me wrong, the bed was great, furniture & decorations were lovely. But get this: There's an open window from the bathroom into the bedroom. Yes, there's a set of shutters you can close, and there's a louvered sliding wood door to the bathroom. But I'd say there's not much \"audio\" privacy, if you get my drift. The bathroom...I'm sure it's very cosmopolitan. The shower stall has a half-wall that's glass, and there's no shower door. The \"rain\" showerhead is very nice. But I'm tall, and that shower is probably only 7 feet tall, so when I washed my hair, I banged my hands on the shower head the first time. Minor problem. Towels were big...but some softener in the laundry would have gone a long way toward \"luxury.\" Parking...it's valet. That's your choice. $55 a night. So when we returned from visiting on Saturday evening about 10:30, there wasn't anyone there for valet. Well, Saturday night...surely they'd cut back on staff, after all it's late Saturday night...who would still be out at 10:30pm in the city of Chicago? Sigh. I parked it myself. Then, they were disturbed with me on Sunday morning because I'd done that. Ok...this is what says Day's Inn. The place has been remodeled and redcorated. Quite nice. But the walls on either side are still \"Days Inn thin.\" We had a \"city view\" room. Read that: our room faced another building, not the lake. The wind was off the lake, yet it was breezy coming into the room. Days Inn all over again. For $270 a night, I'd expected more. And attention to minor things would have bumped the rating, because it really IS well decorated and pretty.

Normally this would not be a problem, until I saw the price for parking at the W Chicago Lakeshore - $55 per night! Insane! Add to that the valets did not provide a permanent car tag for the stay. Upon each arrival, we had to get a new tag, provide our name, etc. and were reminded of the fee with large numbers printed on the face of the tag - $55 - as if we did not remember. The room left me puzzled. I have never experienced a bathroom quite so.....open. A window from the bathroom that opens into the bedroom? Really? What exactly is the point? The shower itself also had no door - or curtain, or anything else to prevent the water from spilling out onto the floor. Each day, the shower was the most unpleasant, cold experience of my life.

The location was ok for walking so if you do not need to leave the immediate area, skip the rental car and save the $55. On another note, Wave, the restaurant was pretty good. The first night there our food was phenomenal. We treated daughter and her bf to dinner another night and it was only average that night. So, hit or miss. But the decor was a hit with 20-somethings. IMPORTANT NOTE: when using the public restroom in the lobby - there are 2 way mirrors. YOU CAN SEE INTO THE MENS ROOM AND THEY CAN SEE YOU. Only at the sink, but somewhat disturbing all the same.

This hotel could improve its overall ratings by hiring a staff that doesn't take 30 minutes to deliver one (free) DVD. While my family was pleasantly surprised to find a huge DVD library free of charge for our use (besides the $25 refundable safety deposit), it took forever to have one unfriendly staff member deliver the DVD (this was after I volunteered to come down and get it myself). I know this sounds very particular, and to be honest it wasn't a big deal- until a couple other small things like this happened. BEWARE, the parking comes with a hefty price tag of $50 per 24hrs, nearly as much as our room which was $70 per night. I would recommend parking elsewhere and walking to the hotel instead of overpaying to park. (or just take the train) Anyways, the stay was very nice- if you like modern design. Our room had a view of Ontario St. which was pretty cool because we could see all the way down the road. The workout room and pool areas were AMAZING- the pool had a view of Navy Pier while the workout area was split into a weigh-lifting section and another section with more cardio-based equipment such as bikes, tredmills, etc. Each of the machines was in superior shape and had its own tv- so if you plan on working out be sure to bring headphones! Being from Texas, the walk from The W to Michican Ave and other major attractions (besides Navy Pier) nearly froze me to death, so if you have small kids this may be of concern.

After booking hotel, three weeks later we got an email for a special New Years Rate, and I had to push to get them to accept a rebooking, then had to push again upon arrival, and then the front help keeps stating that she does not know what this thing is is \"whatever\" about the whole issue. Positives - Great view of Navy Pier (hope fireworks are great tonight!) Bliss products in bathroom and I asked for, and got a bit more. Comfy bed, but really high, and heavy duvet kept slipping down and off. Ample elevators, never a long wait, but lively music for early morning! All musicians performing in this city tonight must be here. Ojays, Big Gigantic and others, so I am excited for some after party fun in the hotel! (New Year tonight). The steak - anything on the menu with steak is the same (bar menu night is same as steak and eggs, served the same way on a stick) and delicious so I am cool with it. They try their best to please, so if you want to pretend to be a rock star, come and drop it like it's hot, because if you really had money, you wouldn't be in this place. The staff is truly kind and try their best (eager) to do what they can. This one good looking \"bell-hop\" porter who I keep seeing is just so genuine. He always strikes up a nice bit of banter and has a kind heart. More negative- Bathrooms have plantation shutters, so you better be comfortable with the bathroom noises of your bed mate and not be embarrassed when you make them! Shower head is rain one, but if you angle it at all, the proof of no water pressure is that it just drizzles out; also there is no door and no lip to the floor, so it is impossible to keep the main floor dry. Only one bathrobe with two guests. Acura car service ends at 7 so forget using it for dinner time. Today is NYE, and they are done even earlier, so why bother?! Bottom line - not coming back unless there is a fabulous deal. Great view, but little other reason to come here. I HATE the nickel and diming.

Our remote to the tv was not working and they quickly replaced it we didnt have to wait hours for them to come up and give us a new one.

There were 7 people in front of me one day and a cab pulling up maybe every 3 minutes. It took forever.

There is the freeway that goes along the lake right there, but I'm still surprised that that would be an issue. The room itself was nice, although not as spacious as the rooms at the City Center W. The bed was higher up though, which I liked. I was able to shift the couch/chair thing so I could do yoga next to the bed. I always like that at Ws they have the TV guide on the TV so you don't have to scroll through each channel. Service was good, although I saw a note in the room saying you could cancel your newspaper if you didn't want it - I did that for the remainder of the stay (just one call), but they only canceled it for the next day, then the final two days I got the paper. Just seems like a waste.

We stayed at the W Hotel in Lakeshore and we left there with a very good impression. It was my second time in chicago and I had previously stayed at The Affinia which is also a nice hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, we were checked in by Annie. She deserves a special mention. Her customer service was top notch. She enrolled me into the Starwood Preferred Guests loyalty program and was just very friendly. Her customer service alone is a reason for me to stay here again. The room we had was a good size and had beautiful views of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier. The hotel has a great spa called bliss and a nice gym. One real positive is the complimentary taxi which is run by a car company whose name I can't remember, but it was great. You just book a time and the car is waiting for you. There was a couple of negatives: WIFI should be free! I often stay at Radisson Hotels and as long as you are a member of their loyalty program, the WIFI is free..A hotel of the calibre of the W should not be charging their customers to use the internet in their rooms. The other negative was the bar...I expected it to be more lively. I think the hotel can do a bit more about that. The W hotel in London is an example. Apart from that, we really enjoyed our stay here.

I am in a wheelchair. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at hundreds of hotels around the world. They ranged from one in WV where trees (and not small trees)were growing through the cracks of the asphalt in the parking lot and there were paper towels in place of real towels in the bathroom (I kid you not) to luxury suites at some of the finest hotels in the world so this review (my first) doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come from an inexperienced traveler. My wife accompanied me. We had spent the better part of the afternoon getting to our local airport and flying to Chicago. When we arrived at the hotel, we were hungry and exhausted; all we wanted to do was eat and go to bed. We checked in and asked the receptionist if the restaurant was accessible by wheelchair since we saw several steps leading down to it. He said that there was a ramp right next to the steps that we could use. We intended on eating as soon as we freshened up. Our first glitch occurred when we tried to get up to the room. The elevators required a key card to work. We tried several elevators but none of them liked our card so we had to wait for another guest to come and her card worked. This was merely a brief annoyance since the card worked fine on the door to our room. Getting into the room with someone in a wheelchair was challenging since the heavy door doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay open (as they often do on accessible rooms) and my wife weighs about a hundred pounds. Once we got inside, I went into the bathroom first. There was a rack with towels on it right in front of the toilet so I had to move it. This is probably an easy task for someone who is not disabled but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a chore for someone in a wheelchair. I moved it next to the tub/shower. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right a tub with a shower in it in an accessible room just like a regular room, impossible for a person in a wheelchair to use. No shower for me in the morning. The description did say that it was a combined shower and bath but I had something far different in mind. My wife went in next so I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d watch some TV while I waited. There was a chaise with a TV facing it on the far side of the room. I attempted to get over to it but, I was blocked by a desk chair. I found that if I put all the way against the desk, I could squeeze by. However, getting between the bed and the chaise was impossible (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the chaise could be moved but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move it) so I angled the TV toward the bed planning to watch it from there. I made my way back to the other side. The bed was so high that there was no way that I was getting on it. Later that night, I had to fall back on it and my wife had to swing my feet around onto it. Absurd! Anyway, I resigned myself to watching TV from my wheelchair. Luckily, the remote was on the bedside table on that side. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. My guess is that the extreme angle was beyond it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s limits. I stared at the wall. We went down to the restaurant and took the ramp as instructed. When we got to the bottom, we were faced with more steps but not another ramp. Fortunately, the table next to us was free and we had a very enjoyable meal. It was superb \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Get the tuna appetizer. It was only after that that we found out there was a wheelchair lift that I could have used but we were never told about it. Back upstairs to our room after waiting for another guest with a working key card. I normally undress and dress by sitting on the edge of the bed. This was impossible due to the height of the bed. My wife had to undress me and dress me again the next morning. If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been alone, I would have been totally screwed. As far as I can tell, they took a regular room, put a bunch of hand rails in the bathroom, and called it accessible. This is a cruel joke to those of us who are handicapped.

The hotel is stunning, but it is not at the best location. The room was amazing! We were in room 1900 which had a lake view. The room has beautiful furnishings and was very comfortable. It was probably 1 of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in. They had a dreamy lounge chair which my husband fell asleep in. Our room had a King bed in it and was spaced comfortably. However, I could see how things could be tight if there were 2 beds in the room instead of 1. The bathroom was modern, clean and fresh. The staff was friendly enough. It wasn't above and beyond service like I would expect at a hotel like this, but we didn't have any negative experiences. The lobby is very nice and open. The conference rooms are a nice size and can be transformed to accommodate lots of different things. I was kind of freaked out by the lobby bathrooms. The mens and womens bathrooms are next to each other. For some reason, the hotel put in a 2 way mirror in the mens room. So they can see into the sink area of the womens bathroom, but the women can't see into the mens. The only way you know is a sign above the sink that states \"You are not the only one checking you out.\" So really you could be in there doing your makeup and not know that some guy is staring at you. My husband thought it was the coolest thing. The location is somewhat lacking. It is close to Navy Pier, but you need to go under the highway to get there. And it is on the other side of the river from downtown and Grant Park. So you would really have to take a taxi to get most places. Bottom line is that if you are looking for a fancy hotel, don't mind walking a lot or taking a cab and are hoping to run into some celebrities, this is the hotel for you.

Like some other reviewers mentioned, it is obvious that this hotel was at one point an older, less nice hotel. The ceilings of the rooms are low and they have old-school POPCORN ceilings. I felt like I was in someone's basement den circa 1987. It was NOT a hipster retro design decision; rather it was a sign of a cheap renovation. Also, this is more of a general complaint about Starwood properties, but it happened to us at the W Lakeshore too, and it really irks me: at the check-in desk, there is always a designated line for Starwood Gold and Platinum members. Presumably this is so these members can go straight to that desk and be helped without waiting in line. Without fail, whenever we have gone to this line, the check-in attendants have continued to take the next guest in their general line without so much as acknowledging us standing at their preferred guest line. We usually end up waiting LONGER to be helped in this line. What is the point?? A few words of praise, though: as I said before, we did really like the lobby bar. The prices were reasonable, the service was good, and it is a chill and comfortable atmosphere. We got a few apps too, and they were tasty. The gym was pretty comprehensive for a hotel. We had a lakeview room, and the views from that side of the hotel are pretty fabulous.

The person who checked me in was able to consolidate my reservations and put me in the same room for both of my nights. Since I was using my Starwood Points, I only got a room with a city view so she put me in a higher floor (31st, there were 33 floors in the hotel) so I can at least see some stuff out the window and not just another building, and she also offered me late checkout, which I took. In addition, I was able to get a ride to the nearest L train station going to ORD from the complimentary Acura hotel vehicles, with barely any notice - about an hour before I needed the ride. The Whenever Wherever rep was also able to print my boarding pass for my flight. I know that's what they are there for, but it made my trip much less stressful knowing they will be able to take care of my needs during my stay there. The bartender on the top floor was very nice as well, I came in there and it was deserted! He was nice enough to talk to me & keep me company until more people came in. The hotel is in a great location, its not right downtown, but its across from the lake, and on my floor, you have a great view of the Navy Pier! The bar on the 33rd floor has awesome views as well. It is walking distance to Millennium Park as well and stores on Michigan Ave. If you're not into walking so much, there are cabs right across the way from the hotel all the time you can hop in to. The beds are very comfortable, and that was the biggest draw, for me, to the W Hotels. I slept like a baby both nights I was there. The only weird thing was, there's no door to the shower, and the wall is made of glass AND there's a window in the bathroom looking out to the bed. (see the pictures!)

For example, we mentioned that we had stopped in Chicago for only a couple of days because my son wanted to get home to his dog. Later, we were pulled aside and he was offered a chance to play with the hotel's dog. Also, we tried to book theatre tickets, but the timing didn't fit with our schedule. That evening we were offered a selection of musicals to watch on DVD in our room. The valet even left a cold water for each of us in the car whenever it was brought to us. Everyone knew our name and they all went out of their way to make our stay excellent. As for the room, it goes without saying that it was well appointed. The decor was a little quirky, but fun. There was a kaleidoscope on the desk and a big fuzzy cube pillow and other unexpected touches. The room was very comfortable and the Bliss products are awesome. Overall, the hotel has a youthful, cool contemporary vibe. We enjoyed it all. Oh, and if you don't mind the mild sales pitch, use the Acura Experience -- free transportation around downtown in an Acura MDX. It's a kind of a strange arrangement, but everyone gets what they want -- Acura a chance to show off their car, The W a likely product placement fee, and I got free transportation in a clean car and skipped the dirty taxis with the wild drivers.

We required an ADA accessible suite which was located by itself on the 7th floor so we weren't able to acquire a connecting or adjacent room. We had an additional room on a higher floor. The suite was a large two room area complete with a 1/2 bath for guests visiting (so the BR area wasn't invaded at all by visitors). We spent most of our time in the suite since we had several visitors join us to watch the Air & Water show. The suite had a great view of the passing jets and aircraft throughout the day but we weren't close enough to take in the \"water\" part of the show. There was a 7th floor outside deck for guests to view the show but rather than pay the $25 per head admission to stand with alot of people on a smallish deck area. We chose to remain in the private confines of the suite (that offered an equally great view without the very loud noise of the jets). During the summer, Navy Pier hosts a fireworks show on Wednesday and Saturday evenings. It's a spectacular view from any lakeview room! We breakfasted at the street level Wave restaurant out on the terrace. Beautiful weather and fantastic people watching as we enjoyed our juice, coffee and breakfast. In the evening we chose to again sit out on the terrace for cocktails and light dining. To our grandchildren's delight, Lake Shore Drive was entertaining with cool cars, motorcycles, double deck tour buses and the horse and carriages driving by. The Magnificent Mile is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The riverwalk is a nice walk away too.There is a small beach right across from the hotel and Navy Pier is very close as well. Rush Street is nearby but I'm not certain how far as we didn't adventure out much since this was a quick overnight stay and specifically for the Air & Water show. The location of the W Hotel provides great access to many great sights, restaurants and shopping. We didn't have an opportunity to visit the Whiskey Sky (Rande Gerber) on the 33rd floor, but we did take the kids to the pool for a quick dip (the pool was pretty yucky in my opinion). There is also the well renown Bliss Spa located on the 8th floor that offers a huge range of treatments. By the way, the bathroom amenities in all rooms are the Bliss product line (one of my favorite body butter products!)

From the hotel room, you wouldn't have any idea about the age of the building - everything was clean, modern, and state-of-the-art.

This property is in probably one of the worst conditions I have seen, especially considering it is a \"W\". Very sad to see that is has been allowed to get so run down. With that said, the view is fantastic and the People are Phenomenal! I am leading a long term project in Chicago and collectively we have had over 100 traveling team members staying in various properties around the city. While I have choices and even other choices with a view of the lake, I have chosen to stay at the W, every week, now for the past year, PRIMARILY because of the PEOPLE!!! The phenomenal W Lakeshore Team!! Your valuable team has truly made the W Lakeshore, my home away from home! I know I should be submitting a separate entry for every person listed below; however, my time is extremely limited and these acknowledgements are a result of many nights and many experiences at your hotel. It would be difficult to isolate each one and remember the specific dates in a separate note, but believe me, they are all real experiences and are memorable moments I have carried with me each week I walk back into your W Lakeshore hotel, just like tonight. I trust that this note will result in equal recognition to each of the staff named herein who have made my experience at the W Lakeshore memorable and easier to be away from home. If possible, would appreciate a confirmation as such. - Linda ONeal: Truly one of a kind, sincere, genuine and acts with pride as if an \"owner\" of your property - you are lucky to have Linda! She has gone out of her way to take special effort to care for my team members and I, in sickness and in health. AND our spouses when they visited us on the weekends we had to stay over. Always greeting our team by name. Truly a role model and mentor for others! A phenomenal lady! - Danyel Davis: very hard worker, both gracious and thoughtful; Always greeting our team and our families by name with a smile and willingness to help make our stay at the W Lakeshore, the best it can be, given our crazy week after week travel schedules. A true role model for others on your W team! - Romon Gomez : Talk about family....my husband, Gary, came into town to visit and went to a cubs game while I was working. The weather was unexpectedly extremely cold that afternoon and Ramon brought his personal overcoat for Gary to wear to the game.........unbelievable!! A true testament to how much your staff at the W Lakeshore Care about your patrons. Always smiling! Always greeting by name and even from afar as we are walking through the lobby. Genuine! Precious Asset to your W Lakeshore. - Donnel Clayton: The most professional and considerate! I see him everyday! always consistently pleasant and went out of his way to help the team get taxi's in bad weather) - Roger Moore: The best smile ever! Roger has been one of the bellman who has picked up my bags and stored them every week for the past year. always prompt, positive and a bright smile to start the day!) - Arlene Hampshire - The pleasant voice on Thursday or Friday mornings when I am checking out for the week. She was instrumental in helping me quickly locate my blackberry that I left in the room when I checked out one Thursday. She went above and beyond to contact security. - Renee ____________do not have Renee's last name, but would like her recognized as well. She and Arlene are phenomenal! You need more like them answering the W/W line. It was either Arlene or Renee can't remember exactly which one, but know it was one of them who took my call after I left the hotel one morning during this past year and thought I left the iron plugged in. I called and they immediately followed through to get someone to check the room. - Darrius Doss - security: so very helpful in locating my blackberry in my room and returning to front desk for colleague to pick up - Dwayne Campbell - security: Dwayne and Darrius worked together to find and return my blackberry. They backed each other up at shift change and it was like clock work!! a matter of less than 45 minutes, all was coordinated and blackberry was at front desk ready for pick up. - Steven Carter: Always a smile on his face! Greeting by name every time he is there when I come in from a challenging long day on the project site. Haven't seen Steven for a few weeks but know that you need more like Steven!! - Alex Turan: I frequently see Alex when I am getting out of my taxi in the evenings. Always smiling and always greeting by name. Haven't seen Alex for a few weeks but also know you need more like Alex!! - Uriah ________: I do not know Uriah's last name but wanted to also acknowledge his excellent customer service. Over the course of the year he has from time to time, picked up my luggage at the end of the week and stored it over the weekend. Always prompt, greeting by name, efficient, pleasant smile and professional! - Daniel Martin: Smiling Dan! Can't tell you how much I have interacted with Dan at the front desk. Works so hard and so many days, but you could never tell it by the way he treats others. He is always pleasant; always smiling; and always looking for ways to make your stay less conflicting. Goes out of his way to ensure follow through on requests made. A superior manager! - Jackie _______: do not have her last name but she is always saying good morning to me from the front desk. Always pleasant! Always smiling! What a great way to start your day when you are day-after-day, at a hotel without your family versus your own home. Jackie is a true role model for others!! - Ashely Seaverson: Ashely is often at the front desk when I check in for the week. Always smiling, inspite of the craziness in the lobby and always greeting by name. very professional and pleasant. You are lucky to have her at the W Lakeshore - Ashley Sarpong: I do not recall ever meeting this Ashley, but I have to say, that she has been instrumental when I have had issues with the room (stale, moldy smells, plumbing problems, blind problems). Can't tell you how many times, there have been issues and she just happened to be on the other end of the phone on W/W line when I phoned to express my concern and ask for assistance. Very patient and helpful! Excellent follow through! - Kevin Carlin: I finally met Kevin a few weeks ago; although I have exchanged emails with him almost weekly over the past year. Talk about genuine commitment to excellence! His follow through and confirmation feedback is phenomenal. His efforts have been key to many positive experiences at the W lakeshore, inspite of the constructional/cosmetic issues of the property. In addition, Kevin has gone above and beyond to help ensure pleasant experiences at other starwood properties when my husband and I were able to get away for a couple of weekends. Excellent customer service!!! You are lucky to have Kevin at the W Lakeshore - Michael_________: not sure what Michael's last name is but he often delivers the coffee/tea service to my room to use for the week. He is always prompt and pleasant. Always greeting by name with a big smile! - Rachel__________: not sure what Rachel's last name is but she sometimes delivers the coffee/tea service to my room for the week and is also extremely pleasant and genuinely willing to follow through to ensure my stay at the W Lakeshore is enjoyable. - Housekeeping staff: I know of two Maria's, (do not have last names) that I have interacted with that have been most pleasant and efficient in their duties. Unfortunately, these are the only staff names I have in housekeeping but if at all possible, I would like for someone to go through my stays and see who have been assigned to my rooms and provide acknowledgements for a \"consistent\" job well done! These valuable employees often go unrecognized because you never see them, but the work they do is instrumental in the overall experience at the W Lakeshore. Can someone please provide confirmation of the staff that are ultimately recognized for their efforts. I Do Not want to submit this recognition note without getting confirmation that these folks will also receive recognition. Such hard workers and all putting their special touch on making the room sparkle as much as possible, given the current construction condition. - Cynthia Destafano: I have never met Cynthia but know she is most effective at her job. Many of the individuals acknowledged above are mentored by her. To me, it is most important to acknowledge those leaders behind the scenes who make a difference by the way they mentor their team! Thank you Cynthia! - Heather Steenage Hart: I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge Heather. I have also never met Heather, although I feel I have just through my interactions with her phenomenal team at the W Lakeshore. This property truly is in such bad need of repair which is acknowledged by all. Staying here now one year and still have another year to go on this engagement, I can tell you honestly that I would not be staying at the W Lakeshore if it weren't for the W Lakeshore Team! I attribute this exceptional, consistent behavior to Heather, a most effective and clearly a respected leader by her team!! I know I have probably left some individuals out and for that I apologize in advance. I have stayed at the W Lakeshore for over a year now and my formal feedback is way past due and should have been submitted every month. Every month, I would have ackowledged these same individuals. I would sincerely appreciate it if each of these individuals could be acknowledged and equally recognized for their valuable contribution to your W Lakeshore hotel and the Exceptional, Consistent, Customer Service experience shared!! Thank you again to the W Lakeshore Team for making this weekly experience feel like my home away from home!

The W Lakeshore is right across the street from the Navy Pier (on the other side of the Lake Shore Drive highway but there's an easy underground tunnel to walk through) area where there's lots of people watching to do at anytime of day. I've stayed at a few W hotels and this one was quite similar to the others and was what I expected. Hip, sleek, trendy and pretty lively in the lobby and bar areas. Too bad there's only an indoor pool. We had beautiful weather while there so we didn't want to swim indoors. It's an easy walk to the Magnificent Mile/Michigan Avenue, to the river, to the touristy sites.

The room was also standard W, but had WAY too much of a fragrance sprayed through the room. Since I was on such a high floor i couldn't open the windows to air it out, so I had to leave the door open. I was informed that it was their 'signature scent' they spray after cleaning the room. I asked them to please refrain from using it during the rest of my stay and they did. I also had problems with the a/c in the room and they were fixed immediately. Upon checking out I found that they had charged me separate internet access for my ipad and laptop, which isn't expressly stated when you sign on. They did end up refunding some of those charges, though. So, overall a nice hotel, it is a W so expect a lively bar and club scene. A nice treat to stay while traveling for work, but i'm not sure i would stay here on my own dime...only because it is geared more towards a party atmosphere and I just don't relax as well there.

First, physical attributes. 1. The Living Room was pretty cool. Although the space is somewhat limited, the use of the space is done well. The design, furniture and layout are lovely and intuitive. The decor is as trendy as you'd expect from the brand. The apples and cookies are a nice touch. 2. The room was better than I expected given how inexpensive a rate I booked. I had a room with two double beds (was traveling with my brother) and I'd say it was just less than 400 square feet. Probably the standard room, but the city view was nice (see attached photo), the washroom was very nicely appointed with Bliss amenities and the room didn't have the \"just on the edge of needing an overhaul\" look that so many hotels have. I felt very comfortable in the room. 3. Sleep quality: the beds/mattresses are first rate. Pillows were great for me but I could see how they might be a bit thick for some. Hotels usually have thinner options if you call. 4. Pool and Fitness Center (what W calls \"wet\" and \"sweat\" respectively) were done well. The indoor pool was much larger than I thought it would be but seemed a bit bare-- kind of austere. There was a menu placed next to a lounge chair if you felt like a snack whilst swimming. The fitness center had great, modern gear and had a wonderful aroma about it. The television signal going into the fitness center was weak, but no big deal. I wasn't there to watch TV. Plenty of towels, apples and nice Bliss wet-wipes aplenty. 5. Restaurant: We only ate at \"wave\" for breakfast, and I was very pleased. My sourdough French toast was wonderful and covered with loads of fresh berries. My brother's omelet was delicious. The food arrived much quicker than I thought it would and was quite reasonably priced given the urban markups prevalent. My French toast was about $12 if I remember correctly. Service was good. The staff is very friendly-- the gentleman (I wish I remembered his name!) who was refilling our water made extra effort to make friendly, unobtrusive conversation about my laptop, of which type he also owned, as I Facebooked while waiting for food to arrive. Those were the only physical aspects of the hotel we experienced. Although we took a peek at Whiskey Sky, we didn't go in; neither did we even take a look at Bliss spa. On a side note: the location is great for families. You are right next to Navy Pier and about 4 blocks from the fantastic shopping of Michigan Avenue. Now for the best part: the service! 1. Arrival: We were greeted by the staff on the front drive and welcomed at the front desk by a very helpful young lady named Bridget. She was kind enough to put us in a very high floor and wished my brother a happy graduation-- I had called ahead to notify them of the surprise nature of the stay. Believe me, those kinds of personal touches, even when requested in advance, can be very difficult for staff to follow through on simply because they are so busy. I appreciated the effort. Bridget offered us bag assistance and we declined since we were traveling so lightly. 2. Concierge: I really, really wish I remembered the name of the fabulous concierge who assisted us Monday night, the 30th. I called to ask if Gino's East takes reservations. They do not, she said, but offered to give me a preferred seating voucher. She helped set us up with a ride in the Acura Experience. This was the highlight of our trip-- we were driven in style to the restaurant, dropped off like VIPs, found the wait staff to whom we showed our voucher, literally WHISKED to the front of the line and were seated immediately, then given free garlic bread, all because we were referred by the W! My brother was blown away. That made our trip. **Remember that the Acura Experience will only give you rides TO somewhere, not pick you up. Bring cab fare or be prepared to walk back. They also only give rides until 8:00 PM. Reserve a ride as soon as you know when/where you want to go. We got a time roughly close to when we wanted to leave but I got the impression that if we had asked sooner, we would have been able to book sooner. 3. Whatever/Whenever: these folks were great. After Gino's East (which is unbelievable, you have to go, but go to the Superior Street location), we had leftover and nowhere in the room to place it. I called Whatever/Whenever and was assured a fridge would be sent right up. 15 minutes later, voila! Mini-fridge in the room. Awesome follow-through. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I was looking to treat my little brother to a graduation present/experience and the W delivered. What was best was that it didn't seem like they had to try that hard to make \"extraordinary\" happen for us. What I mean by that is that they just did what they normally do--provided great personalization, follow-through and service. I can tell when excellent is the norm and when it is the exception.

The rooms are tired and the bathroom could give the bath tub the miss. But then, why did I enjoy my stay? Simply put - the service, the food and the \"whatever whenever\" experience. I can forgive everything else just because of the wonderful interaction with the people running this property- may it be the \"ambassadors\" at the door or the Managers. To me that's what branded hotels are all about. The Food and Beverage at the W (where ever I have stayed) has never been a disappointment and this property too lives up to the standards. The Coffee mornings are a treat - specially sitting outside the living room over seeing Lake Michigan. Conveniently located - withing walking distance of Michigan Ave. and Navy Pier - are a definite plus.

They helped us find restaurants, bars, drivers and boat tours. They went above and beyond. The wake-up calls were great because they let you \"snooze\" and would call back 15 minutes later!! Nice touch to ensure we wake up! Room serveice is 24-hours a day which is nice for late night food. We ordered food at 3 AM on night and it was very quick. The bar upstairs was super fun at night and ever the \"lobby\" bar had a DJ and was really fun. I would say that this hotel is more geared toward adults who want to have fun. I owuldn't suggest familes especially since the bathrooms don't have much privacy. Overall we liked it and would return but I'm giving it 4 out of 5 only because i didn't LOVE the location when trying to walk. The traffic on Lakeshore was always bad so it took a while to get out of that area. Plus it was raining when we were ther so walking distances wasn't ideal. In summer the location would be better since it's on Lakeshore and the lake view is amazing!

I really wanted to introduce Chicago to my husband for his birthday. Well, let's just say it did not go smoothly. First of all, the hotel seems to be in a huge need of a maintenance facelift. The lobby appears to be small and cluttered, the room is an OK size, however doesn't offer as much as a coffemaker! When we arrived, half of the lightbulbs in the room were out, and the toilet wouldn't flush, unless you held the handle down for a while. The furniture looked scratched and worn......Not a big deal. and we were only staying for 2 nights, so we never called front desk........however it never happened to me in other Chicago hotels (similarly priced). Secondly, I booked through Travelzoo, 4 months in advance, and it clearly stated in my promotion e-mail that there is a bonus parking rate of $30, instead of regular $53. When we arrived, the front desk clerk claimed that there is nothing in my confirnation e-mail to prove discounted parking. Well, I managed to find the original promotional e-mail from Travelzoo (back from January 2011), and went downstairs to show it to the manager. Her only response was: \"They (Travelzoo) misleaded you, and this is not the parking rate we offer with your room rate\". Well, that's great - I would've never booked your hotel, if I knew the parking is $53!!!??? There were plenty of others, centrally located, with free parking offer!! The only reason I booked yours was because I wanted my husband to enjoy the lake view on his birthday! After some back and forth communication, the manager agreed to dicount ONE night to Travelzoo promotion rate. Very gracious indeed - but that is not what I subscribed for...... Well, later in the day we went to check out the pool, which was also one of the main reasons I booked this hotel - my husband enjoys swimming and I wanted him to have it all on his birthday. The hotel included sauna and whirlpool in their website description, however all they had was a fairly small pool - no hot tub, no sauna, no lockers either!! The only place you could change in the health center facility was a single M/F bathroom :) To top it off, the pool area was full of families enjoying alcoholoc beverages on the premises (I don't have anything against a little relaxation, just don't feel it belongs to public areas:) Needless to say, we left and never came back. Later that night my husband decided to go outside for a late night cigar, and I joined him. When we were returning back to our room, a person emerged in front of us, demanding our room keys!! Seriously??!!! I realize they care about safety and security of their guests, however their elevators are already programmed to work only when the valid room key is inserted into the elevator slot! I stayed in many hotels in US, both for business and pleasure, some of them in best room Guidelines (50 character maximum) Chicago, and was never treated like that! So much for Midwestern hospitality I bragged to my husband about all these years! :) Just a quick highlight - on the way to the jazz club we were heading that night we got lost and ended up in the foyer of the hotel I stayed last time I visited Chicago (a few months ago) - Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. The hotel concierge was polite ans gracious, gave us the precize directions, needless to say never asked us for room cards, or anything like that. Well, the bottom line is - if you want a quality stay - book anywhere else. This hotel does not have neither capability nor integrity, that come with the deal. The bottom line - if you can book anywhere else for the same price - run and run fast! If this is the best price you can get - prepare to be (unpleasantly) surprised.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe W Lakeshore is not what it markets itself as.\u201d", "Author": "thomjohnson42", "ReviewID": "UR105473223", "Content": "My wife, myself, and our friend all booked one room for the week we were visiting Chicago in mid April 2011. We're all mid 20's and often frequent bars and clubs, so a hotel attempting to turn it's lobby into a \"sexy\" night club with very adult themed bathrooms and suggestive signage on the mirrors seemed to be more akin to our tastes than say a Hilton or The Peninsula while being affordable as well. The rooms were nice enough, location was incredible, short distance to a starbucks, walking distance from nearly everything in the river north neighborhoods and 5 blocks from a train station. Room service was well done and our belongings were often straightened up in a very care-taken pattern and our privacy was well respected (except for the morning when room service entered our room while we were all still asleep at 7 am). We were left to ourselves most of the week which is what we wanted, but when we did interact with the staff, most of it was awful. The concierge is only interested in suggesting businesses that offer some sort of kick-back to the hotel. After being told on our first day to check out Yolk for breakfast after check-in and walking there to discover a 30 minute wait and rude staff as well, we walked two more blocks and were sat at West Egg Cafe immediately and had one of the best breakfasts we had the entire trip. A few days later after asking again for a good Chicago pizza & pasta place that wasn't too expensive, and being sent to Rosebud which was $30 a plate, we used google on our phone and found the famous Gino's East merely half the distance to the hotel than we were told to walk and again felt more comfortable there than at home. They have no interest in suggesting what's right for an individual, only for their networking and feedback. The complimentary Acura dropoff service was fantastic and those drivers were some of the nicest service we had form the hotel all week, unfortunately they were Acura employees and not affiliated with The W at all. As for the pool, if you want to go for a late night dip after a few drinks in their dimly lit, provocative bar (which takes up more half of the downstairs lobby, oh, and half of the upstairs rooftop view as well... and is called Whiskey Sky) and enjoy a view of lake michigan while relaxing... good luck finding your way through the screaming children. In the 7 nights we were at The W not a SINGLE one was free of a swarm of 7-9 year old children screaming and splashing about until the pool closed at 11 pm. I know they can't control who stays at the hotel and everyone has a right to all the amenities, but when we question the desk whether there was any time we could use the pool without being harassed by babies, we were simply sent away with a shrug. We even asked if it was at all possible to keep the pool open for private use simply 30 minutes after hours and were told that was impossible. Don't offer \"Whenever/Whatever\" service if you're not able to deliver. Bottom line is we booked The W under the expectation of a somewhat professional adult atmosphere and were left to a week of self-indulgent, paper-thin customer service, hiding behind a mock-up of class and arrogance, surrounded by the exact type of travelers we wanted to avoid and only felt comfortable in Chicago outside of our hotel.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cEverything You'd Expect From a \"W\"\u201d", "Author": "GoinAwol", "ReviewID": "UR105469110", "Content": "Everything is exactly what you'd expect from a great property like Starwood's W.

However, this W was a location where we wanted to stay, and we are loyal to the Starwood brand. We stayed 2 nights---Sat. & Sun. nights. We anticipated some noise, and we were not disappointed. This hotel had both pluses & minuses. Pluses: great location and excellent housekeeping. This hotel is very clean, and we appreciated that. Minuses: noisy, service not great. Saturday night, there was a lot of noise during the night as people returned from their evening out, and talked loudly in the hallway. Sunday night, the hotel seemed nearly empty, so it was much quieter. The worse noise, however, was in our room. Although the thermostat was on the wall, the blower for the air handling system was one of those boxes under the window. It was VERY noisy, and not particularly effective, as the room was drafty throughout the weekend. Even with earplugs, the roar of the fan bothered me. Finally, the service was hit and miss. A room service order came incomplete. Check-in was particularly annoying. The young lady working at the Starwood Preferred Check-in line waved us up to the counter, but then continued to handle a phone call plus another customer's question while we stood there. When she FINALLY was free to wait on us, my husband politely asked for an upgrade since he is \"silver\" level with Starwood. She said she would see if one was available, and then just gave us our reserved level with no explanation. One might expect her to say something like, \"So sorry, we are full tonight\" (unlikely, since we made our reservation 2 days before), or \"We are full tonight, but could upgrade you tomorrow night.\". We both observed that she was clueless, and did not pursue an upgrade. The whole check experience was annoying. We appreciated the free morning coffee. Finally, I assume this is part of the \"W\" brand, but we found the names of things----extra roll of toilet paper called \"Back-up Plan\", exercise room called \"Sweat\", concierge called \"Anytime - Anywhere\", just a bit \"twee\".

Unlike most Ws, the lobby was bright and well-lit due to the large glass windows overlooking the lake. For my money, Lake Michigan is not all that scenic but the lake view (a block away near Navy Pier) is a feature of this property. The downside to this location is the total lack of drive-in space for picking up and dropping off passengers and the frenzied valet scene. Barely 3 cars can fit in this area and you will be rushed out by the attendants to find your way amongst a maze of one-way streets. NOTE: You can only drive in heading south on a frontage road that parallels Lake Shore Drive. When I checked in, I was given an upgraded room (I'm SPG Platinum) on the top floor but found that there was a disco bar on that floor and the room was near an elevator, so I asked for a different room. The clerk was outstanding. She found us a suite on the same floor as the gym (8th floor?) that was the only guest room on the floor and was at the opposite side of the building from the gym. She even walked us up to the room so we could inspect it. There were conference rooms on that floor, so be aware that if those are busy, this location may not be as quiet as our stay. The bar on the top floor was pitch dark and had minimal seating. SPG, please stop making Ws so damn dark. It's not relaxing or trendy, it's depressing and annoying. When checking out, we found that we were charged for internet service (it's supposed to be free for Platinum guests) and for parking on a night that we didn't even have a car. This took several calls to accounting to fix after the fact.

Truly wonderful. Unfortunately, the service in the hotel was nowhere near as good. When we arrrived at the hotel, there was utter chaos in the lobby. There were so many people waiting (to check in? out?) and kids running every which way, no one even greeted us or offered to help with our bags. This is a vast departure from other W experiences I have had. After this we had to wait 20 minutes on line to even attempt to check-in and even though there was a Gold/Platinum SPG line, there was no preference given to elite members. There was an average wait of 5+ minutes (each way) to take the elevator. Particularly in the evening, there was a line stretching out the front door of the hotel, and not a single W employee was in site to guide traffic or assist with the elevators (though the need for such support was clear) and it took 20 minutes of waiting in a hot sweaty queue. We (and many other guests I'm sure) almost missed the fireworks due to this lack of operations management. I realize the hotel was busy with the holiday weekend, but there's only a certain extent to waiting/delays/mismanagement before it becomes unacceptable. On the evening of July 4th, we had to wait an average of 3-4 minutes for someone at the front desk or whatever/whenever to even answer the phone. Also-- there was no corkscrew in our room (crazy when 3 types of beverages requiring one are sold in the minibar) and it took 2 calls and 45 minutes to get one. Later, room service took an hour. Crazy! Finally there were a few issues with the room that made it apparent that housekeeping was not giving their full attention-- the main light in the room (large floor lamp) wasn't working, the TV in the bedroom had its volume limited to about half of the maximum which would be fine except for the fact that the A/C unit was about as twice as loud as that (so impossible to hear TV). The batteries in the bathroom scales were also dead. And the thermostats in the room were completely wacky-- no matter how high we made the temperature, the compressor/AC kept coming on until we were about frozen out. In sum, while our suite was wonderful, the service we experienced was not up to SPG or W Hotel standards.

I am sad to report that the W Chicago Lakeshore is in need for an important service and maintenance makeover and a subtle review of certain other aspects would do it well. This was not my first stay at this hotel (it was the third) although after experimenting around, I decided to go back for another try since my past stays had been very good. I. Location The location of the W Chicago Lakeshore is one of the main reasons to stay there. Only 3 blocks away from Michigan Ave., two blocks away from the river and with everything else in even shorter walking distance, from the Navy Pier, the AMC theaters, the Northwestern hospital/shool, the Playboy headquarters, but above-all being water front to Lake Michigan .The views are remarkable. Be sure to book a room facing the lake from levels 15 and up, the views are really worth it. II. Check-in/Check-out Check-in and check-out services were flawless and the staff at the front desk appears as very weel trained, friendly and accomodating. III. Cleanliness When I went up to my room, I found a baby crib right outside of my room door, which I had to slighltly move to go in and later found out that it had been probably used in the same room that I was using, as I found about 5 baby toy cars behind the television desk. I felt that this was a sign of lack of care from the room cleaning department, but the real shocker came when I was working on the desk and dropped a pen. As I looked under the desk to find the pen, I also found a couple of very old french fries or other similar food item on the floor, which clearly was not mine (I never ate in the room). My conclusion is that there is a severe lack of control and attention to detail in the rrom cleaning service. I felt nauseaous for a bit, but then regained control. ;-) I complained at the front desk and I that I received was a \"sorry sir\", but no further apology, explanation or, even better, SPG reward points for noticing and, more importantly, informing them so that they can improve their service. IV. Internet and telephone I found that although the cable connection to the Internet service worked fine (not very fast, but decent Ethernet), the wireless (wifi) service in the rooms is useless While the wifi signal is strong enough on the hallways, it is simply not strong enough to reach into the rooms. Three collegaues and I attempted to log-in using our iPads, laptops and Blackberries from the rooms, but all found the same problem. When you complain in the hotel, you are appropriately re-routed to an outsourced service company, that \"pretends\" to verify the problem only to tell you that the routers are up and running and that the problem resides in your device, despite us telling them that we tried with 7 different devices in different rooms and that the devices could not be the problem. They did not care further and just left us with the problem by literally saying \"sorry\" (again) there is nothing we can do about this (well, they should!). I asked for a room change so that i could use the wifi service, but still in the other room (as expected) the service did not work. If you need to rely ona wifi connection to work, think of another place to stay. The telephone on the work desk was also not in good working condition. I tried to join a few conference calls using it, but the amount of noise was too much and I ended up using the wireless telephone on the bedside table, which is more uncomfortable to use for long calls and also has some interference noise. The speakerphone on the desk phone did not work. All in all, the business functionality at this hotel was very limited for me. Shabby, I would say. V. Television A big Kudos for the quality of the television and movie services in the hotel. The selection and definition were excellent. VI. Restaurant I have always thought that some W-hotel restaurants lack identity and charm and this is a perfect example. The complicated sharing-style menu is not only ackward and unpractical, but also greatly lacks in taste and coherence. I shared 3 dinners with colleagues and we all agreed that, for the price, there are so many better options (even at other hotel's restaurants and cafeterias) than the \"Wave\" restaurant. The only convenience of eating there is having your room a few steps away... To top it off, when I was walking out of the hotel one morning, a man approached me with a flyer indicating that the kitchen at the hotel had been found in severe violation of health codes....mmmm.... VII. Room amenities The room amenities shocked me as very lacking. My door was missing the mandatory escape route plan during my whole stay (thank God there was no fire or emergency during my stay...). The curtain covering the clothing area was dirty. There was only one magazine (Michigan Avenue) in the room and not the standard Conde Nast, Time Out or other travel magazines. No in-room dining menu. On hotel-amenities menu/directory, no Spa-menu....mmm is the hotel cutting corners here? No soap bar for the shower.... even more mmmm. At times I felt in a motel and at times the views to Lake Michigan reminded me where I was... VIII. Room maintenance Some parts of the room showed lack of attention to maintenance, from the dirty curtain and lack of escape route plan to the faulty phones, but also, some parts of the wooden wall next to the bed were severely scratched and portions of the wall covering were falling off next to the ceiling. The light in the magnifying mirror on the bathroom did not work, and yes, I did plug it in...., no \"do not disturb\" hanger in my room (I had to ask a cleaning lady for one and she, rapidly, took one that was hanging outside another room and handed it to me (I just hope that the other guest was not disturbed,as he had wished)... IX. Bar Sad, sad,scene. The once lively bar on the 33rd floor now reminded me of a dark room for mobsters or junkies looking to hide from some one. 4 patrons the most I could count. This entire floor has sooo much potential with those views and location. The hotel management should really get around to making it THE place to be in this part of town... X. Acura service The Acure service, which I have used at many W hotels, was flawless. Not only was the car in perfect condition, but the driver was also very helpful in explaining the features and found interest in us as guests. CONCLUSION All in all, my stay at this hotel has taught me that even the best can fail. The W Chicago Lakeshore failed to deliver a good experience on many fronts to me and my colleagues this time. I did alert hotel employees about each adn every of my complaints witha \"sorry\" in return...well yeah, sorry to have stayed there this time... The result will most probably be that I will stay somewhere else during my next Chicago stay. The rest of my colleagues that did not stay at the W this time stayed at other hotels and the comments were mixed, however, I am sad to say that the W experiece was the worst of the bunch this time. I continue to be a fan of the W concept and of many other Starwood brands, but for now: Starwood, a review visit is in order for this hotel, seriously.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Maine", "Title": "\u201cGirlfriend Getaway\u201d", "Author": "TJM0121", "ReviewID": "UR85218698", "Content": "From the moment we arrived (it was very early and they had a room ready for us)--until the moment we left, it was nothing but an absolute awesome experience.

I actually live in Chicago, but as there was a music festival right downtown and I had some free nights through an SPG promotion, my wife and I thought it would be fun to stay at the W Lakeshore during the music festival. The first night was fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as a SPG Platinum member I was given a room on one of the top floors with a spectacular view. The second night, however, was a different story. My wife decided to return to the hotel earlier than I, as I was staying out late to see another band perform. She returned to a dark hotel room to have someone jump out of our bed and scream \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What the **** are you doing? Get the **** out of our room!!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Before she could leave the person physically pushed her out the door. According to her, it was the single most horrifying experience of her life. She was in total shock. She tried calling me, but unfortunately the music venue I was at had poor reception. After collecting herself she went to the front desk to explain that inexplicably some people were in our room. The front desk shocked her with their response. We had been checked out of the room because, according to this person, state law required luggage to be in the room for them to charge us for the room. Since the cleaning personnel saw no luggage in our room, we were checked out. Since we live in the city anyway we only had brought with us a single bag and had returned home that afternoon. The front desk person went on to tell her that the place was totally booked and there were no available rooms. My wife went home. By the time I found out I was furious, but it was late and my wife was shaken up and wanted me to come home. I figured it would be best to deal with the manager the next day. When I phoned the following day, all I could get was the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voicemail. So I instead called the SPG Platinum Desk and explained the situation to them. They were shocked and claimed they had never heard of such a policy of checking people out automatically if no luggage were in the room. I explained I wanted to know why our keys still worked if they checked us out and pointed out that my wife was put in a potentially dangerous position by the hotel with how this was handled. I went on to ask why they made no attempt to contact me to notify me I was being checked out by the hotel even though they clearly had my phone and email available. The Platinum Desk told me they were filing a complaint and the GM of the hotel would contact me within 48 hours. Here was the response I received: Good evening, I received your file from Starwood Corporate and I apologize about your experience last night. As you stated, we had your reservation through today but when my Style team serviced the room, there were no signs of any guest staying in the room. I personally inspected the room around 10pm and the room was still vacant. At that point it is Starwood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy that we must check out any vacant room even if their reservation is through the following day. The only way the hotel can leave a room registered is if we were informed there would be someone taking over the room or if there are physical signs of someone occupying the room. Again, I am very sorry that you and your friend had to experience this late last night. I would love to personally WOW you on your next visit to the W Lakeshore, so once you have made your plans and reservations please contact me and I will make sure you have a wonderful experience. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Warm regards, Grant Grant Bruce |Welcome Desk Manager W Chicago Lake Shore 644 North Lake Shore Drive |Chicago| IL 60611 t: 312.943.9200 |f: 312.255.4499 [email]grant.bruce@whotels.com[/email] I replied that I had no plans to stay at their hotel again. I said I would like an explanation as to why I was never contacted to be told I was being checked out. I also said I would like to know why, if we were checked out, our key still worked for the room placing us in an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous situation. The following day I received this email from the General Manager: Well Hello There, Thanks for visiting us at the W Chicago - Lakeshore. We miss you already. How was your escape? Did you experience Whatever/Whenever service? Why not whisper how your escape was to us? We would love to hear from you! Email me your thoughts on your visit and how we can grant your wishes in the future at [email]GMHeather.Steenge@whotels.com[/email] Warmest wishes, Heather Steenge-Hart, General Manager I sent Heather my issues with our stay and the same questions I had sent to Grant. I never received any response from either Heather the General Manager or Grant the Welcome Desk Manager. I think for the W to give any guest this treatment is absolutely detestable. And the fact that I am at the highest level of their customer loyalty program (Platinum) says that this status counts for nothing when it comes to common courtesy and respect. I should also point out that the W Lakeshore never credited back the free night that they took away from me by selling the room to someone else the second night of my reservation. When I realized the night had never been credited back to my account I had to again call the SPG Platinum desk and explain the situation to them before I was finally credited back the free night.

Had never stayed at a W property before so open to the experience since I had perceived it as hip, cool, enjoyable, stylish, high quality in rooms and services. Read the mixed reviews on TA. But, because they were more positive than negative, I decided to give it a try. I used Starwood points for my two night stay, btw. Check in was well handled at the desk. I paid $20 additional to have a Lake view and a higher floor. Biggest disappointment was the room itself. Dirty windows which made the Lake view less enjoyable. Room, overall, was average. One can tell that the hotel is just \"turning\" in the sense that in a little more time, it will look dated and tired and will need a refresh. Room was clean but just not \"top quality\". Many have mentioned the bathroom with the \"shutters\" that lead into the bedroom area. Certainly, limits privacy which I didn't like. Room size was average to smaller and, with two beds, it was difficult to move around easily. Did enjoy the free coffee in the morning and did always receive prompt service from all staff. All staff, as well, were friendly and accommodating. Did not have any food and beverage. Location was great. The hotel caters to the \"young and hip\" crowd and those of us in Brooks Brothers or past 40 in age (like me) were out of place in the lobby bar and in the top floor lounge. I am a Park Hyatt or Four Seasons type of traveler so maybe I should have known better. All in all, the experience was OK but not worth a second visit. If I had had to actually pay for the room, I would have been a bit angry but since I was using points, I put up with what I needed to put up with. Would I recommend it to the rest of TA travelers?

I do not recommend a standard room for families that want a rollaway. Even with 2 people, it is tight for a longer stay.

We were greeted as soon as we walked in a escorted to the reception desk. Check in was a breeze. Next to the counter is a little kiosk, which you can print your boarding pass. The room was a little small, but was typical for a W. As another review mentioned, the bathroom doors/shutters give you little \"privacy\", this i believe is typical of W as well. Bathroom was well stocked with Bliss products. Each room has a DVD player and LCD TV. Beds were adequate, as is the HVAC. it does work off a sensor, as mentioned in another review. It was never a problem for us. Room also has a speaker/alarm clock system for ipods/iphones. Hotel also has a pool and fitness center, which I did not use. And a Bliss spa on premise. Lastly, W has a courtesy Acura service, which will take you anywhere in a 5 mile radius. This was VERY convenient and allows you to save on cabs. The only problem would be returning to the hotel, if you go farther. We even took it after we checked out, to the Clark/Lake \"L\" station, to get to O'Hare.

They bought a baby sterilizer for me prior to our arrival so that I could easily sterilze my son's bottles and brought a microwave to the room to heat his bottles for him. When we first arrived we were assigned to a city view room with 2 queen beds, but asked if we could switch to a lake view with one king size. This meant there was more floorspace for the baby to crawl around and more spacious for his crib. The staff were only too please to move us and move all our things.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll start with the facilities. (1) The bathroom in apparently every guest room has an insubstantial wooden sliding screen for a door and a large window with flimsy wooden shutters that open directly into the bedroom. In other words, the bathroom is completely acoustically transparent to the bedroom. Even if you are happy sharing a bed with someone, you will need to steel yourself to hear every last bit of noise they generate in the bathroom. (2) To conserve energy, the heating and air conditioning unit is on a motion sensor: as confirmed by the staff, when there is no motion in the room for some period of time, the hvac shuts down. When I visited in July, this meant waking up in a sauna at least twice per night and frantically waving my arms until the air conditioner turned back on. (3) The latch on the room door would not catch without tightly pulling it closed, a problem that the staff said occurred in most rooms every summer when the humidity rose. (4) The business center did not have a single working computer when I needed to print a report for work. (5) Finally, the entire hallway (27th floor) reeked of mildew. Now, the staff. (6) Our room was not ready when we arrived at 4pm, and the reception staff really did not seem to care. (7) They did offer to call us when a room was ready, but they never did call and we ended up wasting an extra hour waiting after the room was in fact ready. (8) The housekeeping department, which seems to prefer to be called the Style Department, made the bed with a duvet cover that was, to put it delicately, soiled by a prior (male) guest. (9) Not a single staff member with whom we interacted seemed to have the slightest interest in their jobs or our stay, and we are platinum Starwood members.

We got to the hotel pretty early (about 10:30 AM) on Saturday, so we didn't expect to be able to check in, but we wanted to leave our suitcases and go wander and grab a bite to eat. The staff was very nice and helpful. They took our luggage at the door (we dropped our mom off at the hotel and then went to find a cheaper self-park lot rather than the $47/night valet). They let us pre check-in, basically assigning us to a room that was being cleaned, and said they would call when it was ready, which would be no more than 2 hours. They gave us a few suggestions for places to eat. We left and during brunch, less than an hour later, they called to let us know our room was ready. The room was average sized with pretty modern, purple decor. Very clean. I was happy to see that they had a recycle bin along with trash cans in the room. The bathroom was fairly large for a hotel bathroom with a window that you could open into the bedroom part. I read in some of the reviews on here that people didn't like this window and the sliding door to the bathroom, but we didn't have a problem with it. We didn't feel that we lacked privacy at all. The location is excellent. It's on the corner of Lake Shore and Ontario. Navy Pier and the beach are pretty much across the street. Michigan Avenue shopping is within about a 10-15 minute walk. There are all kinds of restaurants nearby. They also had a nice service with an Acura dealership that gave guests free rides to anywhere within a certain number of miles (5 miles, I think). That really came in handy and saved us some money on cab fare. You do have to book your ride in advance, though. If you can't get a ride with them, there seemed to be a cab right outside the door constantly. As I mentioned before, the staff was super nice. We did not encounter one unfriendly person. The man who brought our suitcases to the room was very welcoming and helpful. The couple of times that we called the front desk for something the person was pleasant and greeted us by name when they answered. We had a problem with the safe in our room and they had someone up to fix it in about 5 minutes. The housekeeping staff always smiled and said hello when you passed them in the halls. They had someone standing at the door all the time to greet guests and help with any questions. I had read about the music in the lobby, but I was surprised to see that there was DJ playing the music. I had been thinking there was just a loud cd playing or something. It was a little loud, but not annoying, and we had no problems with noisy guests or anything like that. I was actually surprised at how quiet our halls were at night considering that it seemed to be a younger crowd staying there. There appeared to be a few weddings, and bachelor/bachelorette parties staying there. They're also very pet-friendly. We didn't have any pets with us, but I did see a few well-behaved dogs and the room service menu has a separate menu to order your dog a burger or steak. We're all dog lovers, so we found it amusing and good to know in case we ever did want to bring one of our dogs. There did not appear to be any size restrictions either, considering that we were greeted by a very friendly 130 lb chocolate labrador when we got on the elevator once. The only thing that would have made it better was if there was free internet access in the room.

The room was small, dark and it faced the wall of a building, that was our view. The bathroom was not private it had a window open to the bedroom with shutters, poor design. I immediately called downstairs and told the mgr. that we were leaving since there was no other rooms available. The mgr. told me we would not get a credit for the room. I contacted the general mgr. by e mail, as I was told at the front desk they were sure she would take care of the problem. I was also told that they did in fact have plenty of rooms, just not a different kind of room. Heather, the GM never responded to me, how rude. I then took my complaint up with my credit card company. The letter I recieved from my cc company said that Heather's comment was that there was no mgr. named Bill that I spoke with and their policy did not allow any credit even though I was only in their hotel for 10 mins. We were not given credit, thus we were charged for something we did not get. I find the W hotel to be nothing more than modern day bandits.

DO NOT STAY HERE, fellow travellers. BAD experience. A hotel that tries to be hip and cool and instead is loud and obnoxious (there is a reason this place is ranked near bottom at #98). First problem was walking into lobby Friday night - as loud as a nightclub. Sounded like a party going on in the lobby (!). Who wants that after a long flight? Decor/ambience was nice and modern - too bad the people made it seem so awful. In the elevator, got stuck with drunk club kids whooping it up heading up to the rooftop bar (horrible repetitive techno music blaring over elevator speakers, too). Checked into room - decor was nice, larger than average room. Had a nice lake view room (had to pay $50 per night beyond Priceline rate, btw) for a total of $165 night. No complaints. Bit pricey compared to other options - Swisshotel and Hyatt were less. Upon coming back at night, we got denied entry to the rooftop bar (private party). Then upon going back to our room on 27th floor, some drunk people were partying in the hallway (!) and we could hear neighbors talking through paper thin walls. We complained to management - they did nothing, as far as we could tell. Next morning, the room service people banged on our door at 8:30am and woke us up. We told them to go away and they came back again at 9:15am. We complained to management about having our sleep disturbed and they seemed oblivious - as if this is how all hotels operate? Never in my entire hotel life has room service tried to clean a room at 8:30am in the morning. Poor management decisions by W staff here. Ruined our entire stay. End result, $500 in hotel money down the drain. I will never stay at another W (Starwood) hotel ever again. Too many other better options in Chicago - Sofitel, Swisshotel, Hyatt.

My purse was tucked between my feet under the chair/table, and at some point during the meal, it was stolen.

Pretty ridiculous, right? This is the sort of thing that takes practice. The hotel management was unhelpful to the point of being actively combative when I reported the theft. I immediately filed a police report and was met with rudeness and a complete lack of assistance from any of the hotel management. The security guard especially was purposefully rude, and when I complained about the treatment, as the victim of a crime, to the manager, all he would say was, \"I have no control over the behavior of the security team.\" Um, you are the manager of the hotel, and that does not make any sense. We eventually got the security manager of the W City Center on the phone, who apologized profusely and began to actually help us, including taking down a description of the suspect from the people who had sat across from me and letting me know how to file a formal complaint with the hotel, which the hotel manager had completely neglected to do. Even in a less trying situation, this customer service would have been unacceptable, but after being robbed in the hotel, in what now turns out to be a repeated occurrence, it became downright offensive. It's too bad, because I had been a big fan of W properties, but I would never, ever come back to this restaurant OR hotel again. Potential future visitors, consider this your official warning.

Initially was very impressed. We checked in mid-day and both my colleague and I immediately were able to go to our rooms (early). Trendy vibe the moment you walk through the door. Through some promotion I don't recall, I'm currently Starwood Gold, so was upgraded to a spectacular view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier on the 24th floor and given 4pm checkout on the day of departure, which was nice with a late flight. Room had flat-screen TV, two double beds, well-equipped bathroom with nifty Bliss amenities (and there's a Bliss spa on premises). There is an odd window in the bathroom with shutters that can open and close. I didn't mind it, but can see where it might freak out traditionalists. iPod docking station on the nightstand has become an expected but welcome amenity in this class of hotel. Weird traditional analog bedside clock was very hard to see if you woke up in the middle of the night. Closet space is strange because clothing storage is in drawers undeneath the closet so you have to awkwardly bend down to get your clothes. Not a deal breaker but if I had a bad back, would be annoyed. I missed some small amenities like an in-room coffeemaker and a stand for my suitcase for packing/unpacking. Everything's very design-y and trendy and theme-y. The extra roll of toilet paper in the bathroom had a cover titled \"Backup Plan,\" the newspaper was presented every day in a grey bag titled \"News\" that hung on the doorknob,even the bathmat had the word \"Step\" inscribed on it. Little details were fun; guess these are a W signature but I don't stay at a lot of them. Had best intentions of working out so I did visit the pool and gym area, which seemed well equipped. The pool is indoors but there is an outdoor deck which would be fun in the summer months. Loved the treadmills facing the lake. Sadly, business and sleep took priority and I never made it there to actually work out. Had a great ahi tuna sandwich for lunch at the lobby bar and our group even briefly checked out Whiskey Sky, the rooftop bar, which wasn't as exciting as we'd hoped - very small and the view was better from my room. We had the chance to try their Acura \"Wherever Whenever\" service where their driver will take you anywhere you need to go within 5 miles of the hotel - much more pleasant and fun than a regular taxi cab. Service starts at noon so not great for early morning business meetings, but a really fun perk. So I was feeling great about the place initially, but the love affair ended abruptly when after a grueling 12 hour work day, I came back to my room to find that they'd checked me out. All my things were still there, untouched, but a friend came to visit and texted me to tell me the front desk told her I'd checked out. A half-hour ordeal ensued with a manager (Sasha) who insisted my reservation was only for one night (though I had an itinerary and materials given me at check-in that clearly stated two nights) and suggested that somehow I had made the mistake. \"No, there's nothing noted here in the change log, it always was for just one night...\" she kept saying over and over again. Wish she'd spent less energy insisting I was wrong and more energy trying to fix it. I was finally checked in again, but the next day the bill slipped under my door was wrong on so many counts that I had to go to the front desk again to fix it. Wound up with two separate bills, one for each night, which should be fun for submitting expenses. Parking was a breathtaking $48, so I was glad I didn't have a rental car, internet access was $40 for 3 days, and they charged me $2.29 access for calling the airline's 800 number. Be aware. Would I stay there again? Sure. But I'd make them print out proof of my check-out date and rate the moment I checked in. I would skip the internet access and stick to the cell phone for all my calls, even 800 numbers.

The room was a good size and well furnished with a really comfy bed; although if you're not into contemporary design you might not be so keen.

A fruit bowl at the pool side was a nice addition too. The staff were friendly, and we didn't encounter any problems with service. When phoning down, we did tend to get transferred around quite a lot though; a problem I also encountered when phoning ahead of our trip. The hotel is a good looking place and well designed, but let down a bit by the fact that you have to negotiate a busy setting down area on the way in - an addition to a relaxed atmosphere this does not make. The W hotels make a bit of noise about the munchie boxes they have in their rooms, which are really just snack bars and definately not free so do not be fooled. Ours didn't have a price list, and some of the packets had been opened; not cool. The hotel is fairly central, and just across the road from Navy Pier. It's a good few blocks to anything much else though, which is why I wasn't so impressed with it's location. It's got a good bar up on the twenty something-th floor, but be warned; it's coooold. From chatting to the girl behind the bar, I got the impression it was always like that. Perhaps a busy friday night would warm it up.

The next morning we called down to Whenever/Whatever for a coffee maker to be sent up, and it promptly arrived. The lady was kind enough to set it up and start it for us. I was glad to move to the Sheraton Towers after checking out of there, not that the W was bad...it just didn't wow me like usual. I blame it on being W'd out for a bit...am taking a break from them. Likes: location, Acura Experience, pool, staff Dislikes: City view smoking room, amount of people that I don't think were guest floating around, paying for internet (and no, I won't walking to the lobby to get it for free...bring it to me), my overuse of the W brand at the moment (and being tired from too much work travel) Overall: It's great for younger travelers, you can walk most places you'll want to go, and you can easily cab it anywhere else. If you don't know who is on MTV, you probably shouldn't stay at a W. You will just complain afterward. Otherwise, I'll likely stay there in the future, but I will upgrade to a suite.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cLove the \"W\"!\u201d", "Author": "GypsyGirl21", "ReviewID": "UR45588671", "Content": "Stayed here for a night during a business trip.

Upon checkin we were not able to receive our key. Our trip was pre-paid for by my father-in-law as a birthday gift and our names were not on the reservation. His name was the only name on the reservation, due to a hotel error. Due to \"security reasons\" we could not check in until he contacted the hotel to give approval. Understandable to an extent, but again our names were not on the reservation due to a booking mistake. I was ok with this mistake when the lady at the desk bought us drinks while we waited to get a hold of my father-in-law (who is a lawyer who happened to be stuck in court). After enjoying a few drinks at the bar I walked through the lobby to find a bathroom and all of our bags (which had been unloaded out of my car by valet) were sitting in the middle of the lobby completely unattended. It was check-in time and there were at least 100 people in the lobby. Any number of things could have been stolen! I alerted the front desk of this and they asked me what I wanted them to do. The girl at the desk talked to me like I was not a real guest and stomped over to her manager and clearly seemed like I was asking her to do something out of the question. Her manager also acted like I was being out of line for asking for my bags to be stored. 3 hours later we were able to check into the room and waited over an hour to get our bags delivered to the room. At the end of our stay we ended up paying $48 a day for parking even though when we booked the room there was a promotion for free parking during our stay. The front desk asked me to \"prove it,\" in exact words. Shouldn't they have record of their promotions that they advertise. Should the guest really need documentation? Again our trip was a gift we did not have any confirmation information with us, but the reason why we picked the hotel was because of the free parking promotion. On the website that we booked the room with it still lists the promotion which is still valid for a few more weeks!!!!! Overall totally incompetent snobby front desk and management that think that since they work somewhere nice means they can be snobs. News flash, our stay at their hotel cost more than their monthly paycheck! Our waitress was nice and the man who delivered our bags to our room was also nice, but they were the only exceptions!

The bride had made \"welcome gifts\" for her wedding party that were to be placed in their rooms upon check-in. The hotel stated they would be happy to deliver, but there would be a $4 charge per item. No problem. However, while in the lobby, the bride noticed a man checking out that had, not one, but two of her welcome gifts! He was NOT a member of the wedding party! But she was sure charged for delivery! During booking, the mother of the bride had booked 2 Acura's for transportation purposes to the wedding. This too was confirmed by the hotel in an email. The day of the wedding, we called to confirm our Acura reservation and was told \"we don't have you down and we can't help you at this time.\" We then asked if they could call and get us 4 van taxi's for 5:00 as the wedding was to start at 5:30. They stated they would call right away. We went downstairs...no van taxis. Upon questioning the front desk we were told, \"uh, well, we called. Sorry....\" OH MY GOD!!!! The hotel is quite beautiful but the service STINKS!!! They don't even try to fix what is \"broken\". They act as though they could care less if you are happy or not.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vibe - Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "nycadman", "ReviewID": "UR31961184", "Content": "Vibe of hotel is great.

The best part of the hotel is its location which is only an 8-10 minute walk to all the attractions on Michagan Blvd or the Navy Pier. They also have a free shuttle that will take you anywhere within 5-miles. I found that that saved a lot of cab fare. The negatives are that you can hear people when they are walking/talking down the hallways (Although this usually only happened during hours when you would expect people to be awake. I was at the hotel for 5 nights and it only happened a few tiems.) I was never awakened in the middle of the night. I could hear the TV and people talking in the rooms next to me a few times during the day but it didn't happen at night so it wasn't disturbing. The curtain shades don't do a great job of keeping out the light and I found that it a little annoying in the morning when the sun came in through the sides of the \"Block-out\" blinds.

The open shutter's from the bathroom to the bedroom are fine if you are alone as I am on this trip; however, would be a little uncomfortable if you are staying with someone as there is little privacy afforded when the shutters are closed.

First of, this hotel did not disappoint whatsoever. We found a great deal online to stay here and let's just say we either got really lucky or there was a fluke in the system. It's our first time to stay at a W hotel and we would definitely stay here again. I'm not sure if I'd pay for the normal price because it's a bit steep but if we find the same deal again or WHEN I become a multi-millionaire then definitely I would pick this hotel and location again. Things I liked about this hotel: 1) Location - You're right in front of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier which is about a 5 min walk from the hotel. Michigan ave (or the Magnificent Mile) is about 5 or 6 blocks from the hotel. 2) Acura service - we didn't find out about this service until our 4th night there but Acura partnered with the W hotel to take guest from the hotel to anywhere within the city for FREE. You just have to fill in a marketing survey once and you can pretty much reserve as many times for them to drop you off at any location. Only thing is they don't do pick-ups so you either walk or take a cab back to your hotel. 3) Great lobby - we got here on a Thursday and left on the following Thursday. The whole time we were there there was always something happening down at the lobby bar (even on a Monday). It seems to be the place where guests and locals hang out. It was a fun place to sit and hang around. 4) Staff and Concierge - The staff was very friendly and attentive. When we checked in, the lady at the desk gave us a free upgrade (17th floor lakeview). The W truly lives by the Whatever Whenever motto. They brought us everything we asked for at whatever hour (band aids at 8am, delivery menu's at 1am, whatever) and didn't expect a tip. At times, they dropped it off so quickly that I didn't even have a chance to tip. When I did, they were very appreciative. Things I didn't like about this hotel: 1) Pricey cocktail drinks - it's like ordering drinks in L.A. granted their mojito is one of the best I've ever tasted and they're actually known for making good mojito's. I think it cost $11 for one. 2) Whiskey Blue was fairly small and didn't have a DJ. More like a lounge. Chicago by far has the best eating places that can be found in any one city. Every place we went to...granted there was a lot of research done in our part...was phenomenal. One thing I would definitely miss about Chicago is the food. And we didn't even have the chance to try them all. Well, maybe next time. Great eating places that is a must try: 1) Gino's East - definitely worth the 45-50 minute wait for your deep dish. We got the meaty legend. Love the New York style pizza and this one was pretty close. I've seen that they have several locations...not really sure which one was the original but we went to the one on the corner of Ontario and Wells. Don't forget to bring a marker as they allow you to tag their walls. 2) Al's Italian beef - one of the best...if not the best Italian beef that's out there. Definitely need to get it w/ hot peppers and dipped in the sauce. They even deliver!!! 3) Ditka's - I'm pretty sure everything in the menu is good but the one we tried was the pork chop and NY strip steak. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The Mac n cheese w/ bacon is an absolute must. Trust me. 4) Silver Palm - we saw \"No Reservations\" w/ Anthony Bourdain. If you've seen the Chicago show then you know which one I'm talking about. A little scared that it was all hype but the three little pigs sandwich was amazing. One piece of advice, make sure to ask for the gruyere cheese (our mindless waitress forgot to mention they offer it w/ gruyere and cheddar cheese) so we got the cheddar thinking it only comes with one kind. Oh and the onion rings were awesome too. 5) Le Bouchon - Located in Wicker Park/Bucktown. If you love French food you definitely have to go to this place. It is a hidden gem in a somewhat residential neighborhood. The place is very tiny and was always packed (We got there an hour before our reservation thinking we could be seated early but to no luck). So make sure to make reservations. Really good price. Three-course menu is about $25! On Tues, all items are available for the prix-fixe. The boudin noir is excellent. Things to see: 1) Art Institute - Probably one of the best condensed collections of famous paintings we've seen so far. We've been to Metropolitan Museum in NY, Louvre Museum and Musee d'Orsay in Paris, and Getty Museum in L.A. But the Art Institute in Chicago was astounding. You must try to get here early as we got here late in the afternoon and there was not enough time to browse around and really appreciate the art. Definitely a must see. 2) The Signature Room (Hancock Tower) - we wanted to see the city landscape and this is one of the best places to see it. You can also see the city view up in the Sears tower but you have to pay a fee to go to the observation deck (I think it's $15/person?? not sure) So instead of paying $15 to get a 10-15 min view why not put it towards food and cocktail where you can sit down and enjoy the view for 45 min. or more? Women, the view from the restrooms may be the best. Other tips when visiting Chicago: 1) Taxi cabs - before going to Chicago we read in one of the guide books that the cab fare cost about $40-$50 from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare to downtown, which we found reasonable since it's a 30 min. drive there. We could have taken the El train but with our big luggage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s during rush hour??? Not sure if it was a good idea. Our cab driver seemed nice and was telling us there were two ways to get there. The short route or the long route. Logically we chose the short route but he told us that even though it was shorter in route it will take longer because of traffic. So we opted for the best route he recommends. Well, when we got to the hotel our bill ended up being $80!!! We were shock at the cost and he reasoned the additional cost was for toll charges and blah blah blah. Well, we found later on that we pretty much had been duped. The concierge told us the cost should've been around $40 and there were no toll charges to be charge. He said that the cab drivers in Chicago own their cabs so whatever money they make goes entirely to them. And any additional charge is all up to their discretion. Best bet is to find out the cost for shuttles (make sure it's a flat rate) coz you don't want to be stuck in a traffic w/ the meter running. Or better yet make sure to pick Midway as your airport as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 15 min. from downtown. We took the El train back to O'Hare around 5:30 in the morning. Definitely worth it coz the train was free and clear. 2) Do take the El train to go around the city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it only cost $5.75/person for a one day unlimited ride pass. It's definitely great if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning to venture out of downtown. Things we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like about Chicago: 1) Poor transit layout. Not as effective as other cities like New York, London, and Paris. Very few trains run east/west. 2) People were not as friendly as we thought they would be.

I've stayed at this hotel twice in the last two months, and I can say with certainty that all of the shimmery, velvety, meant-to-wow appointments in the lobby don't mean jack. The hotel is nothing special. If you can afford the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever, Whenever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd celebrity milk baths and bottles of Cristal in your fancy-smancy suite, then maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be better, but most of you will have an experience more like mine, checking into one of their regular rooms. On both of my trips, we pulled into the parking area and were not greeted, or welcomed. No one offered to help with bags. The lobby is nifty (though as someone else noted, some people may not like it at all - my mother, for instance, would squirm in a place that tries so hard to scream its \"coolness\"). Check in was efficient for both of my stays. We had a lake view room. The view of the lake and pier is nice, but there is something that looks like a water treatment plant taking up a lot of the view. There are issues with the room themselves too. It's your basic hotel room - entry with alcove closet (with no door) and no floor, so no where to store shoes really. There is a mini-bar, bathroom, and bed (s) with a desk across from it. There is the ubiquitous chair and tiny table, and that's that. As many have noted, there is an odd pass-through with shutters in the wall between the bathroom and rest of the room. The first time I stayed at this hotel, the shutters were broken, and would not stay closed. The second time I stayed here the shutters worked fine but the entire room steamed up the one time someone was able to take a shower that actually included hot water. The appointments in the room are Ikea like \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inexpensive, but trendy, minimal and contemporary. But, add a flowery bedspread and take away the decorative pillow, and you could be in any motel/hotel anywhere. What they describe as a chaise is actually an armless chair. Sounds carry in the room, and listening to others using the toilet is not my idea of a good time. Speaking of noise, the walls seem very thin; sound carried from housekeepers in the hall, the people having sex next door, televisions and CD players. It was loud unless I turned my own TV on. There is no microwave in the room or coffeemaker (though you can get a coffee maker if you ask for it). When I did, I was sent one cup and nothing to stir with. I found the bathroom items to be OK in quality but small in size. They really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold enough for more than one person. The way they promote their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sinkside six spa experience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, you really expect more. And that sums up what the real problem is with this place. They have clever marketers who know how to give everything a sheen of nice, making it all sound lux, but its lipstick on a pig. Useless. A good example is the bathrobe they leave in rooms. ONE bathrobe. Nice, but I wonder how many people feel irritated at having to call housekeeping to request a second one (for a tip). Better hotels think ahead about the things that really matter and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inconvenience their guests nearly as much as W. The beds are OK. I found them rather hard though I appreciated the abundance of pillows. They are mattresses set on boxes, constructed from what looks like plywood painted brown. Use care when approaching the bed since the frame goes all the way to the floor. We jammed our toes painfully into the side of the beds more times than I can count. Turns out there are reasons most beds have legs and a space underneath. Our window blinds broke in the down position, the chain coming off the track. The tub stopper completely came out of the tub when I tried to lift it out to drain water. Grout spilled from the tile into the tub whenever the shower was used. I noticed scuffs and wear and tear in almost everything in the room, though not horribly so. This place needs to pay more attention to the details that really matter. The local WGN TV channel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come in right, The repairman we called to try and fix it so we could watch a local hockey game said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been broken for years and gave us some lame excuse about why. Thing is, I live in the Chicago area, also have Dishnetwork and my reception is just peachy. We were offered a free movie to make up for the trouble (which was nice) but it was on our bill when we checked out. So, a freebie turned into another issue to deal with, another hassle. Someone mentioned how neat it was to come into the room for the first time to the CD playing, and that IS a nice touch, but not one they do for everyone. In both my stays, I was met with silence. Only one of the rooms even had the CD laying there. The music was awful too, very dance, frantic beat type stuff that I imagine someone in W Marketing loves and thinks really sets their tone. It just made me antsy and irritated. Contrasting this is another hotel I love (The Metro in Milwaukee) that also has a signature CD that they actually do have playing in every room upon check-in. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jazzy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cool. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the kind of thing anyone would find enjoyment in and most of all it complements the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and vibe so well that you truly do feel instantly transported to some chic yet soothing place. W\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s music is bad disco at best and only made me wince. W Lakeshore also has a problem with their hot water. On both stays, at some point, they ran out of hot water so we had chilly showers (not fun in Chicago when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in single digits outside). The pool wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open on one of my stays and we were not notified when we made the reservation or upon check in. When we complained to the manager, explaining that the entire reason for that trip was to give our daughter her birthday wish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c time in a pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were told that some people had been given passes to the health club down the street. They must have been madder than I was, for no one made me such an offer. About the hot water in the room, she claimed engineering had checked and it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Only after telling her how horrible I thought her attitude was did she even offer anything to compensate for our miserable stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she said if we ever came back that she would inspect our room personally. Gee, thanks. If she actually did that for our second stay, I have no clue, but she missed the broken blinds and tub stopper, and forgot to turn that CD on. My second stay was more of the same. This time we ate at WAVE, the restaurant. Very nice d\u00c3\u00a9cor, again, and the food was OK until we found something floating in my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beer, and I found a bone in my duck croquettes. Service was slow and inattentive. The small plate concept leads to a lot of dishes when tables are not cleared. So I ended up eating with my elbows lifted to avoid dragging my sleeves through old dishes. Oh, and parking is $48 (robbery). The coordination between parking and the front desk isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very good. On my first visit, they hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put the parking on the bill, so my husband had to run back inside, wait in line and handle it himself. Taxes are insane too. Bottom-line - stay here only if you are concerned mostly with how things look on the outside.

I will admit that as a guest we have due diligence to make ourselves aware of that cost, but as a former Front Office Manager of another hotel, I certainly ensured that my staff would confirm guests had a vehicle parked and that the guest was aware of the charge. Regardless, at check in we were handed our goody bag. Five minutes after we arrived to our room, the chocolates arrived, and five hours later we had to ask about our champagne. Whiskey Sky was overpriced. Wave was great for people watching - though we felt ignored in the afternoon. And then there was the afternoon manager, I can only assume - as it was sometimes hard to determine who was an employee and who was not. - who was flitting about the lobby smacking her gum, certainly not saying hello to her guests. The room itself was very sexy - dark, romantic, comfortable. Bathroom needed some minor maintanence - one tile on the floor was very loose, with broken grout. Wallpaper near the door starting to curl, stand for the sink needs to be restained and sealed, as it is starting to show some wear. Minor stuff, but things that do need to be attended to. No coffee maker in the room, so if you care to have the morning cup o'joe and don't want to pay the super high room service charge, go down to the lobby - another thing that the front desk agent did not disclose.

Although I read a lot of poor reviews when doing my online research I still chose the W for various reasons. Fortunately, I realize a majority of those who post here are completely disgruntled and need a place to vent.. and typically 90% of those who are disgruntled are normally hard to please anyhow. I have high-end taste but also realize the W is NOT the Waldorf Astoria. The W Lakeshore is a boutique hotel...meaning it is NOT your standard Holiday Inn, Marriott, etc. The decor is considered somewhere between modern and \"zen-ish\". Although the lobby area is a little congested, we knew we didn't plan on staying in the lobby all night anyhow... ;) A few days before we arrived - I received a \"welcome email\". The email suggests if you have any \"wish\" to make your trip even more joyful, to please contact the \"Whatever/Whenever\" desk. I thought it would be nice to have a bottle of wine delivered to the room while we were getting ready for dinner to \"unwind\". I received a response the same day indicating we were upgraded to lake view accomodations and would have a complimentary bottle of wine awaiting us at 5pm. (WHICH WE DID!) Acura also has a program with the W - which provides complimentary car service to any place you want to go. We were picked up at 7pm by a driver in an amazing Acura MDX. We felt like we were being chauffered in luxury (and we WERE compared to the taxi service!). The following morning we decided we wanted a later check out then 1pm (their standard checkout time) and they graciously honored us a 3pm checkout with no issues at all. The W was VERY accomodating. As long as you check your attitude at the door, realize that its a HOTEL and again.. not a PENTHOUSE stay... the staff are very helpful, pleasant and will do everything in their power to make your stay a memorable one. YES... the bathroom DOES have a sliding door and a window that faces the sleeping area covered by shutter doors... unless your an absolute prude who needs complete privacy...

The location of the hotel is pleasant, overlooking (as its name suggests) beautiful Lakeshore Drive and Lake Michigan. The atmosphere, especially downstairs, is about what you might expect from W properties, a veneer of swankiness complimented by thumping techno music and a bar scene that befits a eurotrash pick up bar more than a hotel lobby. When we arrived, bleary-eyed from a red-eye from the west coast, this was not the sort of greeting we wanted but we accepted it as the W brand. Fine. The rooms, however, showed the the swankiness and design consciousness of the brand is just a veneer that masks some rather awful, poorly thought out design choices that run counter to the \"Whatever-Whenever\" comfort philosophy espoused by every staff member from the front desk to the room service servers. First, the bathrooms. As other reviewers have pointed out, the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a shuttered window. The idea behind this design is understandable, sensible, and shared by a number of many a luxury hotel (such as the Park Hyatt in Chicago or the St. Regis in San Francisco) -- while you take your bath or shower, you can look out both onto your lovely, tastefully appointed bedroom as well as a splendid view of the city. In execution, the W falls flat on its face. The above-mentioned hotels that share this design concept use a sliding partition that can block out the sound of the bathroom at night; the shutter system used in the W rooms does nothing to block out sound and the problem is compounded by the fact that the toilet (at least in our room, though I know it is a feature in most rooms) is not located behind its own door. So, lets say you're trying to fall asleep in your lovely bed and at say, 3 a.m. your significant other has to get up and use the bathroom -- you'll hear everything he/she does. Some might call this intimacy; we thought this terribly off-putting. When we raised this issue with the hotel staff, they apologized but said that all rooms were like this and that this was part of the hotel's charming, design-forward aesthetic. Our response: is this aesthetic scatalogical? The second problem, is the a/c system. While we had set the temperature to a usually comfortable 68 degrees at night, we woke up numerous times overheated. I kept running over to the thermostat to try to ensure that the system was working. We understandably called a maintenance person, who informed us that the a/c system is controlled by a motion sensor. Being from green-conscious California, the idea of saving energy through motion-sensing technology is a good concept and we applaud the W for that effort but, once again, the design was flawed. If you are in the room, the lights are out and you're in bed sleeping, this means that there is no motion in the room. So, no matter how low you set the temp, you'll be burning up around 3am. In sum, we would only recommend this ill-conceived and poorly re-developed property to someone who got a rate for well-under the advertised rack rate. For all the design flaws (and we only mentioned two), the regular room rate should not be around $300 in the summer. This hotel is a blemish on the Starwood brand. If you're already paying $300 for a regular king-sized bed for two people at the W, save yourself the aggravation and stay at a nicer property (and in Chicago, there are plenty).", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, il", "Title": "\u201ceh..\u201d", "Author": "x23", "ReviewID": "UR16785162", "Content": "We stayed in what is billed as a \"spectacular room\" The view certainly was..

We stay at W hotels a lot, and we know what to expect from them. In contrast to other W hotels in general, we found the staff to be adequately professional, knowledgeable and friendly, but we did not get the \"wow!\" experience that the W always talks about from any of them. We had made a special request that they obtain a Wallpaper guide to Chicago for us in advance of our arrival, and they came through on that with flying colors. I want to give them credit for that, as it is not a standard request. Yet we were not blown away by the staff's knowledge, professionalism, nor the anicipation of our needs and wants as we have been at other W hotels...including the W Chicago - City Center. We appreciate a friendly bellhop that bothers to ask what we're doing in town, if we're looking for anything special, makes suggestions, and takes the time to show us where things are in the room. At the W Chicago - Lakeshore, we just got the, \"here's your room, there are your bags\" treatment. Okay, but not impressive. The rooms are beautiful, although a bit small. We had a lake view room and it was nice, but I didn't find the view to be all that spectacular. The privacy in the bathroom isn't much, because there is an open window between bathroom and bedspace, and as another reviewer commented, it's only closed off by wooden shutters. The design of the public areas is quite lovely, especially the bathrooms in the lobby area, which offer floor-to-ceiling opaque glass so that you can see ghostly figures between the men's and women's bathrooms (only by the handwashing sinks). The lobby is rather small for a W Hotel, so we were disappointed upon going downstairs at around 7 pm to have a drink in The Living Room (the lobby) that there was no room for us to do so. The one feature that did impress us was the restaurant. They were offering Pan-Asian specials when we were there, and the wait staff was top notch. It's not cheap, but what we had was worth it. We booked a one-day stay at the Lakeshore to check it out and then booked the remaining two nights of our stay in the W Chicago - City Center because it was cheaper. We thought we'd be missing the W Chicago - Lakeshore after what we'd read about the City Center's small rooms and dark lobby, but we were very glad that we had booked our two night stay at the City Center instead. The location of the W Chicago - City Center is much better for doing things downtown, their staff seems much more personable and capable, and their concierge department is out of this world. The interior design is opulent, using projections on the high ceilings and large glass vases holding strings of orchids in water. If one is trying to decide between the W properties in Chicago, I would suggest booking a larger room at the City Center, as the small rooms are apparently very, very small. Still, I bet you can get a larger room for less at the City Center, and it is a lot more W-ish than is the Lakeshore...if you go for all that funky W kind of stuff.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201ca very expensive disappointment\u201d", "Author": "nood65", "ReviewID": "UR16485227", "Content": "My husband's secretary booked us at the W because of the view of the lake right across the street.

Instead, she said, we would get a \"city view.\" (This turns out to be a euphemism for a view of the office building directly behind the hotel and a roof top full of exhausts.) Our room was a huge disappointment! It was very small and had no real privacy between the bathroom and bed area, just wooden shutters! The bathroom had no exhaust fan, no heat lamp, and the lighting was ridiculous. Good luck putting on make up. One robe was provided for two guests. The beds were solid to the floor (watch your toes) and too high up. There were no blankets, only a sheet with a bedspread. There was no decor to speak of, just a ceramic cup with pods sticking straight up and one small frame on the wall with several vertical sticks inside. There were no lamp shades, only strips of cloth hanging from the wire frames. Bizarre! The snack bar items were not priced but we found out they were very pricey, along with everything else at this hotel. A poached egg and two orange juices set us back over $30. We ate at their lobby restaurant, The Wave, which has a modern look and sound. The food was extremely expensive and only mediocre. My glass of house champagne was $15. We had a rough time sleeping due to the noisy on and off all night of the cooling system and the loud slamming of the hall doors during the night.

When i related the incident to the manager she was not able to listen because she was the only person in the lobby who could tag luggage and was busy at the moment. At breakfast i stood in line in back of a couple who were seated immediately by a waitress who never bothered to tell me that I was standing in the wrong place and that there was a hostess station behind the pillar. I remained invisible and only by luck saw a hostess who then informed me of a twenty minute wait for a table while i watched her seat walk-ins within 5 minutes from the bar where i resigned myself to ordering and eating a very cold bowl of oatmeal without salt or sugar or water served with it as I watched INCREDULOUSLY the lack of help by the staff toward an elderly man that could not manage the steps with his walker (the lobby is not handicapped equipped) and the GUESTS jumped in to assist him . The Bell boy must have stacked 20 pieces of luggage on top of each other and just kept taking more and more for fear of lost tips without any regard to laptops falling or anyother sensitive items that might have been damaged. It was a totally untrained staff. The lobby is set up so that guests coming in through the doors and exiting out through the doors intersect the guests spilling out of the elevators at the same time that they will inevitably bump into the lines waiting for the concierge and the baggage that is being loaded onto the carrier. There simply is no room to do business here in this lobby. A VERY POOR DESIGN!!!!

I've stayed various W Hotels in NYC, San Francisco, etc and do so for the modern, hip style and happening bar scene. If you prefer a more business-type or relaxing hotel, you might want to look somewhere else. Location - It was my first visit to Chicago and found the W to be very centrally located to everywhere I went. I found everything to be a 20 minute or less walk. Only cab I needed was to the airport. Lobby, Bar & Restaurant - Yes, the lobby is busy and loud. Pretty much all day, every day. But I never had a problem with the front desk, or getting a drink at the bar. Ate at the restaurant on Friday night, which was okay. I recommend eating out some where else (if you can). Room - My room looked just like the pictures, so no surprises there. Room is not small, but no big either. It was pretty close in size to hotel rooms in NYC and San Fran. Bed was comfortable and TV had good selection of channels. There is also a DVD player and clock radio with Ipod hookup. Not a lot of closet space, but enough for a weekend stay. Newspaper was delivered outside the door every day. Service - Along with the vibe, W hotels are known for their service, and the W Chicago Lakeshore did not disappoint. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. I especially enjoy the W's \"whatever, whenever\" service. On Saturday evening before dinner I called asking if the hotel had any sugar-free redbull. They said they don't carry it, but would get me some. About 30 minutes later, 3 cold cans were delivered to my door. The charge on the bill was less than $10, delivery included.

This is not an ornate old hotel with giant chandeliers and the kind of service that goes with a stuffy ambience. As an example, there's a dessert on the room service menu called \"Fantasy\": strawberries, whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and a disposable camera. There ya go. Also, the ladies room in the main lobby has mirrored panels that are actually 2-way mirrors, so that as you're checking your lipstick the people on the other side can see you. LCD walls in the lobby play clips from \"Moulin Rouge\", the lobby becomes a bar at night, the wall behind the reception desk is sequined. Much of the atmosphere is fun, tongue-in-cheek, with a little bit of edge. I found my room to be very comfortable and cozy, done in grays and purples... the Bliss bath products were a great touch (I can tell you that the set of toiletries you get each day sells in Sephora for $25). I found the food to be pretty good, except the $80 Kobe burger on the room service menu wasn't worth the $80 (but fun to try). Other nice touches: in the gym, they have a fridge with moist towels, so that you have an ice-cold towel to wipe off with after your workout. Your wake-up call isn't a recording, it's a live person saying, \"sorry to interrupt your dreams... shall we call you back in a few minutes? it's cold out today, please bundle up.\" They play ambient lounge music in the elevators, which changes slightly throughout the day so that at night the music goes more with the bar/lounge vibe of the lobby.

The bathroom looked really cool...but wasn't very practical. It was dark so it was tough to see clearly in the mirrors. There wasn't much sink space, the shower was a bit tricky and there were slotted doors and windows connecting the bathroom to the bed area so you could hear everything. The view on the other hand was spectacular. It looked right onto Lake Michigan and Navy Pier. The hallways leading to the rooms reminded us off decor taken from TLC's Trading Spaces with smooth pebble/stones bordering the walls/floor. We didn't take advantage of the fitness or pool area nor the restaurants, but there is a great (but expensive bar) on the roof ( Whiskey Room)) with one of the best views of Chicago at night. And there is a trendy bar on the first floor off the lobby that caters to the hip after work crowd. The location is a bit out of the way but walking distance to Michigan Avenue shopping/restaurants and the John Hancock Building. The doorman can easily get taxi's there as well. It is also pretty close cab ride to Navy Pier and to the AMC River East 21 movie theater.

As soon as you walk into the lobby the music is playing and you can tell it certainly is geared towards a young crowd. The check-in was absolutely seamless and quick, very pleasant. The music in the elevators is a little loud - and is always on, which is a bit much in the mornings. The room was small but not tiny by any means and we loved the decor. The best parts of the room were the comfortable beds and the plasma tv. I would have to say that the lighting is a bit dark, especially in the bathroom. Speaking of the bathroom, there is a shuttered window which opens and closes facing the sleeping area so if you want privacy you wont get it - especially since there is no fan in the bathroom! Could be uncomfortable... We were there from Nov 1 - 4th and were worried about the 3 to 4 block walk to Mich Ave and Rush street since it was cold, but it wasnt too bad. In the summer, the walk would not be an issue at all and if it had been warmer, we probably would have taken advantage of being so close to Nave Pier and gone over there. The lounge bar, Wave, was WONDERFUL. The bartenders were very polite and attentive - we started every night there. It seemed like a very popular place and there was always a good sized crowd. All in all, we probably could have paid a little less and stayed on Michigan Ave. If you have money to spend and want to be around a young, hip crowd - stay here.

Our earlier stay (December 2006) was riddled with issues including the filthy pool and dark hallways and rooms. After writing to the W about the issues, they we gracious enough to have us back for a complimentary stay. I can see that they have made improvements to a number of areas to address many of the comments here. On our stay this time, we were in a Marvelous Suite on the 30th floor (3018). The view to Navy Pier and the lake was wonderful. Some improvements of note include: There is now key card access to the elevators (to prevent others from getting to your floor). They removed the river rock gutters and low lighting in the hallways, replacing the carpeting and changing to much improved hallway lighting. The rooms themselves now feature white ceilings versus dark grey, which drastically brighten up the rooms. In addition, the huge, bulky entertainment centers are gone (along with the tube TV and cheap Fisher CD system), replaced by a LG 42\" plasma screen and Bang and Olufsen BeoSound1 system. A great change indeed! Doors and other things have been repaired and while some items remain a bit strange (the shutters in the bathroom) and just bad (bathroom lighting), overall, they have made improvements from our stay just a year ago and management has been very good about addressing things noted in these reviews. The location can't be beat, but yes, Michigan Ave. is a $5 cab ride away in the cold weather. You can walk it, but bundle up. They have a bunch of CD/DVD rentals available which were a nice touch. The lobby bar is OK with decent drinks at high prices. Parking is a bit steep at $46 and when looking at room service menus, keep in mind that prices are $2 higher than the normal menu price, plus a $3 delivery charge, plus 20% gratuity. So, your $4 OJ in the restaurant is actually $10.80 when using room service, quite a bit more. The gym is pretty good and the pool looked much improved from our last visit. Check-in speed was still a bit slow and the lobby can get congested with the comings and goings and check-in desk all within a few feet of each other.

We stayed at the W due to a wedding we were participating in and thanks to our great friends we had a fantastic time and it was easy to overlook the problems. None the less, unless you are there with a group, there are clearly nicer and less expensive hotels in Chicago. First off. The parking is a complete rip-off!!! 46 dollars a/night plus the tip to get your car. There is a parking garage around the corner that is a little less and is within walking distance. The W. trys to come off as a trendy modern hotel. Their staff certainly has the \"Beautiful People\" look, but, beyond that the hotel really comes off as a run-dow, dimly lit, holiday inn, that was re-furnished by IKEA......10 years ago. The rooms are clean but small and worn. The bathroom is even smaller and only comes with a shower, no tub. They have cut an open window between the bathroom and room to give the illusion that it is much larger than it is. The space is only closed by a set of shutters. Thus it does not allow for a lot of privacy; and as my wife observed, would not make the most romantic setting if you were there for the first time with someone you were dating. In fairness, the beds were awesome and we had a great nights sleep. The bar was a lot of fun, but anywhere and anytime, we get together with our friends it seems like fun. They play a lot of that trendy disco style of music and you would fit in well if you have one of those cool kid club shirts to sport around in. That trendy disco music is blaring at all times in the hotel which lend itself to a vegas feel but gets a little tired after a while. In short, the hotel is not dirty. The room are adequate and clean, the bed is very nice. But in the end, so is a Fairfield by Marriot at a fraction of the price.

Room service was tasty but quite slow the last time I stayed there, but they comped my meal without my even having to make a comment about it. The rooms aren't huge, but they are well-appointed. As all Ws do, they have great Bliss products for the bath. For other business travelers, I have never had issues getting online from the rooms, which is a bit rare in my experience. I have had FedExes sent to me at the hotel, and they are very conscientious about prompt notification of receipt. Note that the HVAC is a bit disruptive, as it's unit near the window that turns on and off quite abruptly, so if that type of thing keeps you up at night, you might want to bring earplugs.

Even the sequin signage outside the hotel was in disrepair. The room itself could definitely use some spiffin' up. As for the staff...SUPERB!! They work their tails off to ensure you have a relaxing and wonderful visit. Of course, the location and view are to die for...except during an ice storm.

Definitely visit Bliss Spa here, but stay elsewhere. I had a king room on the 11th floor with a city view. It was a wheelchair-accessible room (lower hanging bar in the closet, grab bars in the bathroom)-- otherwise it was done in the typical W style with darker colors and a rather sleek look. There was a random faux-fur, cube-shaped pillow that was supposed to be a whimsical touch. Overall, the room wasn't stunning, but it looked fine. The bed had a very uncomfortable featherbed on top of it. Usually, I love anything that makes a bed more pillowy, but this had sharp, pointy feathers in it! A bigger problem was that the bed smelled terrible. I couldn't tell what it was-- the pillows, the mattress, the featherbed--? At one point, I saw a guest taking a small dog into the elevator, and I realized that's what the bed smelled like-- unbathed dog! The minibar also had sodas in it with best before dates in 2006. They leave you a little comment card for housekeeping where you're supposed to be able to make small requests, so I asked for fresh soda... it never showed up. And I know they had seen the note (I left it on the bed) and refilled the minibar. (Furthermore-- no minibar price list.) The light in the makeup mirror in the bathroom was burned out, so I asked housekeeping to check that too-- never got fixed. Also, it's pretty clear that the hotel is trying a bit too hard to seem hip. Here's an example. The hotel information is presented in a weird lucite holder. It's fastened at one corner and you slide pages out. I'm sure it was not cheap to produce, and it's just silly. It doesn't make me think I'm in a cool place... it makes me think they don't particularly care for how usable something is as long as it looks funky. I generally enjoy more contemporary hotels, and I understand what Starwood is going for with this brand... they just have to deliver style as well as substance, a la The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. Good points: Bliss Spa is excellent. I had a facial, and I highly recommend it. The Bliss products in the bathroom are great. Nice high-def TV.

I have a real issue too when the hotel advertizes & promotes free coffee & danish/bagels in the morning which being an early riser & a smoker, was welcome while I read the paper outside on a cute little terrace off the lobby, but when I came for a refill was charged $4.50 for a coffee!!! Turns out \"free coffee\" is only until 6.30am!!!! The restaurant in the lobby has excellent food, though it is loud being right in the lobby with no walls seperating it. One thing that peeved us was the advertizing of the hotel's bar which upon arrival was found extrordinarily lacking & appeared to be built as an after thought without any effort in decorating. Also, they don't have a food licence (???) so its all drinking without even a peanut, let alone being able to order appetizers, for that matter we couldn't even have room service bring us something. The hotel's brochure could use a radical editing! On the PLUS side however, the concierge was wonderful & was able to get my 4 girlfriends into the Oprah Show on standby tickets which really made their trip.

The staff is incredibly curt. They make it visibly obvious that any request you may have -- be it as simple as a wake-up call -- is an inconvenience for them. The communication between the hotel's front-end and its other staff is poor as well. I asked not to be disturbed when I checked in as I had just gotten in from a long flight and wanted to nap a little bit. To my surprise and disgust, a housekeeper walked right into my room without so much as a knock at the door. She claimed not to have been told that there was a guest in the room. The hotel insisted on buying me dinner at their restaurant -- Wave -- that evening (which was WONDERFUL, actually). The design of the hotel is poor. As another reviewer mentions, this was formerly a Days Inn (or some other such lesser quality hotel). As such, the infrastructure is thin and in need of repair. Entire conversations can be heard from adjacent rooms. The management is all too concerned with themselves to be of any assistance to the guests in this regard. In fact, when I mentioned it to them, the manager said, \"Well you got an adjustment yesterday; what more do you want from us?\" I was appalled to have been spoken to in that way. I wanted my reservation to have been carried out just as it was planned; I was looking for nothing special at all. It was audacious and overly obnoxious for the manager to have behaved that way. \"Whatever/Whenever\" at this hotel is more like \"Nothing/Never.\" After three nights of the same types of experiences (plumbing not working correctly, housekeepers ignoring the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, entering the room when the guests are present, noise from adjacent rooms, and the audacity of the management), we relocated to the W Chicago City Centre. Our experience there was highly enjoyable and made up for all of the inconveniences at Lakeshore. When we return, we'll head straight to the City Centre hotel (or to the Intercontinental on Michigan Ave., which seemed incredible!). Last thing to mention is the decoration of the room: I was not expecting to have a window -- with shudders! -- leading from the bathroom into the main part of the room.

The hotel is totally hip and trendy, although I will say that I was not overly impressed with the Whiskey Sky bar. I personally like the lobby bar much better. Also, the hotel smells fabulous and the location is great. On the downside, I thought the walls were a little thin. You could hear everyone open and close their doors all down the hallway. I also didn't really care for the shutter window and shuttered door concept on the bathroom. It leaves much to be desired for privacy. The only other thing worth mentioning, which has also been mentioned before, is that they do nickel and dime you to death. I'm used to mini bar prices being high, but $6 for a small bottle of water is ridiculous. Breakfast for two a la carte in the restaurant ( not room service ) was $40 with the tip.

Bathroom,not enough water pressure, not enough hot water, color was grey with one wall red, not enough lighting, a pocket door that did save some space, but then they added a wood shuttered window opening from bathroom to bed area, that you could open from both sides, some might think that is trendy, but I did not. The hallways were on the dark side, with small rocks placed on both sides, the entire length of the hall , very different, I haven't saw that done in any other hotel. But I doubt if anyone would say they wanted to stay here because they had rocks in the hallway. I get really ticked off about bottled water in the rooms, I feel that if hotels place water in the room it should be complimentary, the W charges $3 for a small bottle, and $6 for the larger version. I was hesitant to make the coffee in the room, not sure if they were going to charge a fee for that also. Coffee in the morning downstairs was over $3, that is not a good thing.

The hotel is relatively central and was within walking distance to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The rooms however while being cool are very average and really rather small. There is a bathroom with a sliding Japanese style door, that works sometimes. The bathroom had only a shower, and was tiny. I must say that the bed was very comfortable, however the walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbor's every move all night long.

We felt utterly welcomed and relaxed! It was a rough night, but I'm happy I didn't end up staying at the W. It looks really cheesy and cheaply constructed. There were guys wearing big gold chains and sunglasses at night, posing, and preening with their giant SUVs by the hotel main doors. Once inside, expect pounding the music in the lobby area. The W may not guarantee its room reservations, but it does offer complimentary blasting music all night long. It was impossible to talk at a regular volume.

The weather was suprisingly gorgeous, (high 40's low 50's) which made the short walk to Magnificent Mile from the W very pleasurable. The hotel seemed like the place to be. We arrived at midnight on Friday and the lobby was live w/ what looked like an afterwork crowd at the bar. Everytime you stepped out of the elevator you felt like you were at a party, or in the least a lounge. The music was not loud or overbearing as many have posted on this site. It is not a hotel I would recommend bringing your children to, and it is best suitable for anyone ranging from 23-40 who enjoys the party scene. The rooms were nice, beds and linens were very comfortable, and the bathroom was adequate (and yes the Bliss products were a total plus). The lighting was dim ( the type of lighting that makes you look flawless) which after a while can get on your nerves, but not enough to make me not want to stay here again. Back to the lobby- perfect for casual lounging while taking full advantage of their free wifi and sipping on a cocktail. The barmaids were extremely friendly and come by any part of the lobby you are in to take your order, so you don't even have to get up to go to the bar. We found a great restaurant on Rush St called Heaven on Seven (Hi Mike!!) which served the best GUMBO we've yet to taste. They have an endless collection of hot sauces w/ all sorts of crazy names. They also have a great breakfast menu. Sears Tower was totally disappointing and was just a check on our list of things to do in Chicago. However, the corner of the Sears Tower was like a ride at Universal Studios. The wind on that corner was something fierce- we couldn't even get the cab door open, which was really strange since it wasn't windy anywhere else. The mall at the Water Tower Place was great. Best boot collection I've ever seen at the Lord & Taylor's there. Best deep dish pizza is hands down , Giordano's. (Pizzeria Uno- the original- doesn't carry the same menu as the franchised Uno's do, and they don't have the happy hour menu's either- in my opinion- not worth the visit). We found a cool Irish Sports Bar w/ great drink specials called O'tooles. There is a place called West Egg that seemed like a great breakfast spot- but the wait was 25 mins so we didn't eat there. The menu looked great tho, and the prices were just right. You have to tip the copper cowboy on Magnificent Mile to take his pic, but definitely one for the memoir books. We took a 10 min cab ride to the Funky Buddha Lounge, and had a blast. Great place to meet locals who can tell you about other places to check out. Navy Pier was nice. You feel obligated to go since the W is directly across from it, but other than the Forest Gump impersonator in front of the Bubba Gump restaurant, it wasn't no where near the highlight of my trip--although the ferry ride around Lake Michigan made for great pics. There is a free trolley that travels all around. Ask the concierge for the schedule and it will save you alot of time and cab money. My friends took the train from Midway and said it was really easy to figure out. We took a cab from O'hare and that ran us approx $40 w/ tip. Depending on what time of year you go (weather permitting) there's lots to see and do within walking distance of the W. On our last night there we checked out the Whiskey Bar on the 33rd floor, but it was EXTREMELY dark and SMALL. Smoking is permitted, so if you don't smoke, it's not the place for you since it's so small the cigarette smell will linger all over you. Last, but definitely not least for me, we visitied the Chicago Public Library. 10 Floors!!! A library enthusiasts heaven!! Overall, I loved Chicago.

However, now that I'm in DC, I travel as often as I can to Chicago and get to choose hotels. My favorite remains Sofitel (design/amenities) and Sutton Place (location/amenities). I love to travel and typically go at least 4, if not 5 star hotels. I took my boyfriend to the W because well, it's the W and the W in NYC is pretty nice. I do not recall the last time I left a hotel but we left W. OK, here is my review: For a long weekend, we were booked in their spectacular room overlooking navy pier/lake. GORGEOUS VIEW and if you're into that, this is the place for you wan to stay. While the room looked very pretty, it was NOT CLEAN. The rug needed a vacum and the duvet cover was dusty on top. While the bathroom was designed to look ultra chic, HORRIBLE LIGHTING , girls! never have I experienced such bad lighting in a small bathroom anywhere! I don't know how they managed to get it so poor but I was afraid to put makeup on not knowing what I'd look like. Also, the shower had no door and is a stand up only. Note it has no door and the water just runs into the entire bathroom..ridiculous design. The shades on the room were exceptionally difficult to pull down to cover the brilliant sun which comes in with the great view at like 6am. BOTTOM LINE: beautiful design requires some quality and thoughtfulness to make it practical. SERVICEWISE, I ordered some hot water after a late night out with friends at about 12:30 on a thursday night. I had to call 3x in order to get a cup of hot water delivered almost a full hour later! Suffice it to say, my boyfriend and I cked into Sutton Place as early as friday. I will say that he and other friends of mine particularly enjoyed their spa, Bliss though I can't comment on that. Also, admittedly their feather bed and sheets were ultra comfy. As a Chicago local, I would also add that W lakeshore is not the best location for your visit.

Not Good: - The hotel trys too hard in the \"chic\" category. The hallways and rooms are much too dark - after spending a bit of time in the room, we felt claustophobic due the color schema. - Way too many drunks during the evening - the hotel is integrated with a bar on the 32nd floor which means you're riding up and down with all the party-goers each evening. Not cool when you're traveling with a toddler. - The elevators are extremely slow. There are four total, which are shared with the staff and club-goers.

The suite itself was just two small rooms patched together. If I had had a basic room, I'd probably have an entirely different reaction to the hotel. The corners were dusty and one of the doors separating the bedroom and living room had been knocked off its hinges. The bedspread had seen better days and the towels were downright ratty. Toiletries (Bliss) were great as always. No turndown service. The promised Sirius satellite radio did not work and the maintenance man, when called, failed to fix it and threw in the towel.

All in all, the weakest of the 4 Ws I have stayed at, but W still creates an atmosphere very successfully. In New York, I can't speak highly enough about the W Court, which was fantastic, but the Chicago Lakeshore just showed too many signs of its former incarnation as a Days Inn.

The reception to the hotel is all tile, LCD screens, recessed lighting, etc. The elevators smelled like lemongrass, which makes you want to rush to the newly incorporated Bliss spa for some pampering, but also made think it might be to mask some kind of elevator odor as the bulding seemed quite old despite the mod finish. The hallways are dark with red recessed lighting and smooth riverstones in a trough running down both sides of the hallway. The room is very modern and nicely decorated and the king size bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. The requested crib was your basic crib and matress which was a dissapointment after experiencing the heavenly crib that is available in most Westins.

Here is the list of cons on that aspect: * Small room means lots of bumps and bruises. Mirror leaning against the wall looks great but is hard to keep a kid from crawling behind. * All the nice knick knacks they put out (rocks, glass with twigs inside, etc.) were quickly cleared away which took away from the \"experience\" of the chick decor. * No bathtub. * Room service meal from kids menu (spaghetti, mixed veggies, miscellaneous tips/delivery charges, and milk) cost a staggering $28.00.

Also, I still found the shutters separating the bedroom and bathroom to be odd and off-putting (although I note that someone called me a 'privacy freak' in another review for having mentioned this), but at least the end panel of the bed did not fall off this time. I still think this W falls a bit short compared to other Ws, but that is largely due to the building being what it is (converted Days Inn with low ceilings), so there was not a lot to work with to begin with (although the location and views are great). The only couple off-putting things this time around was the top floor bar being closed for a private party (which I understand is not uncommon), and the fact that there appeared to be full of family reunions and lots of kids running around. Perhaps it was just timing, but usually a stay at a W is a chance to escape kids playing in elevators and running/screaming around lobbies...

My wife, two children (6 and 3) and I stayed there for 2 nights and would stay again if we ever traveled back. Although the hotel appears to cater to a different crowd (singles and couples without kids) the staff was very helpful with all requests and even gave both of our children a pack with a bunch of games, a yoyo and water bottle upon our arrival. One cautionary note: we ran into a hotel employee on our elevator ride down to go walking and he offered us some water to take with. He then asked us for our room number so that he could send up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something for the boys.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We thought this was a very nice gesture but found out at checkout that he had charged the water to our room even though we never asked for it. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It is only a short walk of 2 blocks to Navy Pier, 10- 15 minute walk to Michigan Avenue and 25 minute walk to Millennium Park. We took a water taxi from Navy Pier to the Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum to save walking in the 96 degree heat for $12 round trip per adult and $6 for children over 3; this is much less expensive then a regular taxi and a lot cooler. There is also a FREE trolley system that goes all over the city with connections at Navy Pier. The only problem is that you may have to get on and off a couple of different trolleys to get to your destination, but it is FREE. The beds were VERY comfortable, the claim on their website about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pillow-top mattress, 250 thread-count linens and fluffy goose down pillows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was true. For a 4 star hotel the room was a little on the small side, it fit 2 double beds with just enough space for a chair by the window. The only thing that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care for about the room was the fold out window shutters in the wall between the bedroom and bathroom; they open and close so that you can watch your spouse shower. However, this could be uncomfortable if you have other people like older children staying in your room. Plus the shutters don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you a feeling of privacy. The swimming pool was adequate in size but there was NO hot tub. My wife went up to the bar on the 33rd floor one night while I was tucking in the boys and told me that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very large or impressive, but then we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there for the nightlife. Be prepared to pay for parking if you bring a car, the rate was $39 per night. Also, an Internet connection in the room if needed was another $15 per day.

Even though my 5 year old loved it, it was sort of \"creepy.\" The black pseudo-asian decor is pretentious. There are no vending machines in the entire place. If you want a pop, you have to go to the bar or order room service. We wanted to spend a weekend downtown without having to go back on the train each night. Next time we go it would be better to stay right on N. Michigan Ave. Part of our package was to have a \"spectacular\" lake view. They put us on the eighth floor and all we could see was the building. We had to schlepp down to the lobby and change rooms. Of course, no other rooms were available at that time. I guess this would be a fine hotel for \"hipster doofuses\".
