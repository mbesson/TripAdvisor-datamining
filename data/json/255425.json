Its number one asset, we felt was the front desk staff. No matter what question we asked, we got excellent answers that were actually accurate. (This is in direct contrast to the front desk staff at a Savannah, GA boutique hotel where we stayed last fall!) If we needed dinner recommendations, we got them. One staff member recommended taking the train to one stop past the Sydney Harbor Bridge and then walking back across the bridge. A staff member also helped us figure out how to take a train to get to the Girl Guides shop which had moved from three blocks away to an industrial park on the way to the airport. Another staff member told us they did not call cabs, but she assured us we would have no trouble getting a cab at 4 am to get to the airport. True! We had a cab in 10 seconds....... We are walkers, and we really liked the location of the Vibe. Close enough to walk back from The Rocks, close to Darling Harbour and Chinatown.......Also close to the Town Square Mall which had a Coles Supermarket, a liquor store, various shops--pretty much whatever we were going to need. Also, the hotel was only about two blocks from the train station, so we were able to take the train from the airport and pull our bags those two blocks instead of paying for a cab from the airport. This hotel is not as hip as we thought based on the pictures......and each night a different senior citizens bus tour seemed to be pulling up to the hotel! Gotta fill those rooms! Our room was a very good size for a city hotel, good sized and comfortable king size bed, large bathroom. The TV was a plasma that was very small for the size of the room and which had virtually no channels. We elected to read and compute instead. Walls seemed a bit thin, since I could hear a person coughing next door now and then. Internet is a rip-off $25 Aus per day, but there was a 3 day package that made it like $20 a day. We were on the 9th floor. Good news: that's the floor where the exercise room and the rooftop pool are located. Bad news: the elevator stops at the 8th floor. Start climbing! The front desk offered to bring our bags up, but my husband likes to do it himself, so he got some more exercise. Would I book again at the Vibe if I found myself in Sydney again? Probably. The room price was such a value when contrasted with the ridiculous rates being charged at the Rocks.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBad experience!\u201d", "Author": "KathLChoo", "ReviewID": "UR127497894", "Content": "Well, this is my first time staying at Vibe Hotel, as I've seen pretty good reviews on it, and especially with the general manager commenting on each and every review on Trip Advisor, i decided to give it a shot! What disappoint me most was on my second day of stay, i experienced the fire alarm twice, once in the afternoon and the second time at 2am midnight! That was half an hour each wasted for that day. Besides, having the housekeeper knock and saying it's housekeeping before entering room for clean up should be normal procedures, but housekeeper opened the door in less than 1sec after knocking and DIDN'T mentioning that they are housekeepers. If only my door were not locked, she could have seen us naked! Third experience would be THROWING MY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS away when I've placed them nicely on the table to indicate that those are important! I have my assignments, flight boarding pass and airport pick up documents thrown away! How ridiculous is that! Although the receptionist had been very nice by offering to print my documents all over again, the time required to look for all my documents and to save on my hard disk and to wait for them to print is so time-consuming! It wasted me another hour for doing all these when I didn't have to! The hotel offered us of either free breakfast or $50 refund for the night of fire alarm. Though we took the $50 refund, but seriously, is my time wasted for all these nonsense worth only $50?

Although the hotel had lots of new guests arriving, we got a good deal and could keep our executive suite without problems. The Danish manager even called us in our room to check on our situation. Luckily it wasn't anything ruining the rest of our trip (onwards to Christchurch) and we are happy to recommend this Vibe to other travellers. The roof-top pool and fitness room are both quite small, but overall the standard and ambience is top. Clean and spacy room and bath, well-functioning a/c and as mentioned: friendly staff. Can also highly recommend the Macchiato restaurant/grill on the corner of Liverpool and Pitt, just a block away. Cute waitresses and excellent food! Another great option for dinner close to Vibe is right down Goulburn to the Civil Grill, where they serve excellent $12 signature dishes in various flavors: Steaks, burgers, seafood etc. Although you might have to wait a while for the kitchen to process your order, it is definitely worth the wait.

Thats understandable, we all have terrible days, but when I got to my room I was a bit disappointed with its cleanliness - especially the bathroom. The bath surrounds were dirty which turned me off wanting to use it as a bath. As others have said, the TV doesn't actually turn on with the remote - it just changes channels and turns it off. I needed to manually turn it on when i used it. Dont expect a large foxtel selection either as it is just a few select channels. Maybe it was just my room, but it seemed when some rooms ran their water - it made a large whistling noise. Very annoying at 2am!! The hotel is in a pretty good spot and there are a few convenience stores around if you want to get something a bit different from the hotel food selections - as well as some authentic indian restaurants within easy walking distance.

I was fearful that such an early arrival would mean waiting for a room, but to our delight our room was waiting for us and after a very warm welcome we were happy to see a clean comfortable room. I think any beds at that time would have been comfortable but indeed the beds at the Vibe were comfortable as we took a few hours nap (we aimed to try to get used to the new time zone before starting the cruise the next day. After lunch we then noticed that one of our pieces of luggage was missing. The shuttle company had failed to load it at Sidney Airport. We only had our home address on the tags (Not the Vibe or Cruise information). We immediately informed the Vibe staff or our dilemma and were told there were several shuttle companies and I did not have a receipt of the one I used! The Vibe staff made several calls and by the next morning our luggage was reunited with us! This \"extra mile\" service was very appreciated as this luggage was our formal clothes for the cruise and would have limited our enjoyment (and budget!).

We have stayed in some world-class, amazing hotels but I was lucky enough to get them all at a huge bargain.

When we arrived we got welcomed quite unfriendly (thats not something you want to experience after a 22 hours flight). We then got told that we got upgraded to family room, which meant that me and my gf got a very inconvenient and small room crowded with 3 kingsize beds. The room was in a quite bad condition; windows were old and damaged (couldnt even close them properly why it was noisy from the traffic outside) and there were further defects on furnitures and on the carpet. The cleaness was the most disappointing as the room from a objective perspective was very dirty. Not only that the bed sheets were full of splotches and that the floor in both bedroom and bathroom was very dirty, but also were the walls soiled and almost all pieces of furniture not clean. Despite the good location of the hotel, the view from our room (think was 3rd or 4th floor) was to the back, looking directly at an old building not beeing able to see anything.

Firstly at check-in a $200 pre-authorisation is required to be held on your credit card by Vibe hotel. Sure, no problem, had we been notified upfront!! Having travelled extensively domestically and internationally my husband & I have learnt that the total amount of your stay is typically held (as a pre-authorisation) pending your final bill. Understandable!! If you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paid upfront!! When we have paid upfront, the hotels have always taken credit card details and ID as a cautionary stock measure, with no pre-authorisations being made! We have stayed from 2 star places to 5 Star places, my husband has even stayed at a 6 star (Atlantis, Dubai) and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even do what Vibe Hotel wanted to do!! The Vibe Hotel Sydney works differently\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We paid for our 5 day stay upfront, $605 (through hotels.com). Upon arrival the hotel explained the pre-authorisation is held in case you trash the room or drink the whole mini bar, etc. Again, understandable, only, if we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paid upfront!! We also provided, in accordance with their policies, credit card details and ID. The staff were extremely repetitive, insistent and unsympathetic as the $200 they required was $200 less our holiday money. If the terms & conditions, through hotels.com had stated this prior to booking or prior to our stay we would of budgeted and accounted for this. However no such documents were provided, not even by the hotel, and even upon check-in, none of the documents we were required to sign stated that this was policy and was required for check-in!!! Merely a small A4 sign at the desk and by word of the staff. After reiterating several times I understood their policy, I asked to see the Duty Manager, hoping to come to some kind of compromise. I explained that as they had failed to include this on their terms & conditions, that as they failed to notify us prior to our stay and as we had paid upfront this was an unfair application of this policy. It took me 20minutes to speak to the duty manager personally, as the front desk clerk was redundant in the explanation of said policy. The duty manager offered to half the pre-authorisation but as I know my rights as by the fair trading laws, I was not happy with the result. Finally a compromise of the $100 pre-auth. was made, with the promise that the Duty Manager would talk to the General Manager to have the funds released the following day. Thankfully this was the outcome but unfortunately it took quite a bit of negotiation, and anguish. I would not recommend this hotel, but the place itself is nice so if you can overlook service or aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fussy, this is a cheap way to stay in Sydney.

A quick walk one way and you ended up in China town and Darling Harbour, which is the hive of activity and a must place to visit.

So i guess the direction of the room where it face will determine the quality of stay for the guest. I will definitely remember my room number & will ask for the same room if i were to return back to Sydney. On the whole, the room was rather clean and spacious. Counter staffs were friendly and helpful. I missed my airport transport which was booked by the hotel and the counter staff was able to schedule another one within 10 minutes thus i was able to catch up with my flight. Wi-Fi was quite expensive though. Would advised the management to have their own Wi-Fi facility instead of out-sourcing it. Cheaper price on Wi-Fi would definitely benefit & attract more guests staying at the hotel. Location was superb with Chinatown about 10min walk and Darling Harbour about 15-20 minutes walk..Main train stations (Central & Museum) were within walking distance.

It was clean and tidy in general if a little tired. The view from the room was of the Sydney skyline including the Sydney tower. We both slept well in this room which was quiet and the bed was comfortable. The TV in the room had a noisy and poor picture. The next time we stayed here the room was on the Elizabeth Street side of the hotel this was again an upgraded room. There was in fact two rooms a bedroom area and a lounge area with a TV in each. The room was clean and tidy but again a little tired the seal around the bath was stained and needed replacing. This room was very noisy particularly from the road below and the railway across the road, the noise goes on all night The windows in the rooms were double glazed but not very well as they had gaps in the sliding panes of glass which just let in the noise. If we had been staying longer than two days I would have asked for another room. Another member of my party who had a room on the top floor which also suffered from the noise on this side of the building asked for another room. The young girl on the reception was not at all sympathetic and only grudgingly found them another room after he insisted.

Firstly I'll mention the things I liked: - The hotel foyer was clean, and the room was very clean, but the corridors were always dirty and littered with room service trays. - The room was a good size, and the sofa was a nice touch. There was plenty of room for storing and hanging clothes, and an iron and board too. - The bed was comfortable, and the sound-proofing (for central Sydney) was good. - The gym and pool on the roof was a nice idea, but I'm not a gym person, and it was too cold and rainy to swim. - The location was excellent. - It was good that the hotel let us store our bags after checkout, and use the shower before heading to the airport. Now my disappointments: - The extractor fan in the bathroom didn't work. I guess I shouldv'e reported it during the stay, but I informed them on checkout. - The toilet covered the seat with tonnes of water after every flush, and I let them know about this on checkout too. - The toiletries were especially low quality and cheap. - The WIFI was $25 per day - absolutely insane. This is the first 4 star hotel I've stayed at, in the world that didn't have free WIFI. - The staff were OK, but not great. And the Curve coffee shop staff were particularly not nice. I only bought one coffee there, but it wasn't very good, so I went a couple of blocks down and got coffee from Pie Face.

The hotel is located at Goulburn Street. The surrounding is just buildings. Being a foreigner and a 1st time visitor to Sydney, I found the place was safe and vibrant.

There is cinema complex nearby and pubs every corner. Transportation is easy. Plenty of cabs and Museum train station is nearby. There is a few convenience store nearby. Please avoid those and head to 7-11 as the those convenience store doesn't have a price tag on items and the prices varies by store. Hotel ----------------------- The hotel is clean and nice. Has a chic design and modern theme. After 11 PM, you have to use your key card in order to get into the hotel which is good security measure. I had the a Queen size bed which was quite comfortable. The room was big with a large wardrobe. The room had a study table, a couch and a large LCD TV. The bathroom was big, clean and had a bathtub. Hot water is not an issue. Overall the room was quite comfortable. Room Service ----------------------- My study lamp was not working and I wrote a note to fix it and left it on the study table. I forgot to bring it to the receptionist the next morning. However when I can back to the room in evening, I found my note was missing and the light was fixed! Amazing service. I had a few issues with my Internet connection and they were quite helpful in getting it fixed. The Internet can be slow at times or no connection, but it's ok most of the time. However for some reason Apple devices are unable to connect to their WiFi. Breakfast ----------------------- Some thing needs to improve its their breakfast spread. It's the same thing every single day. Try going early for breakfast, as this hotel tends to stock up on tour crowds. I do take pity on the waitresses trying to manage them and plates/food can run out some times.

Vibe is also very close to Chinatown, which made for several enjoyable outings. Bathroom was on the small size, but nicely equipped and more than adequate.

It's a trendy hotel very similar to the ACE NYC in many ways: the modern deco and the apartment building conversion. It does have bigger rooms and more windows. The hotel is located on the south end of downtown area (or CBD-Central Business District, as Aussies put it). The free CBD shuttle runs in front of it on Elisabeth St., very convenient. The free shuttle runs in circles from both directions and the route and schedule can be found at the concierge desk (though we never found anyone person there). It's about 10 minutes walk to China town and attractions in Darling Harbor. It's NOT close to the Sydney fish market, which I highly recommend to visit. It took us about 30 minutes to walk there. We took the airport hotel shuttle to and from the hotel. It's AUD $14 one way and the driver offered AUD$10 for return trip. We took it. Both drives (from and to airport) took about 15-20 minutes, but the return shuttle took about 20 minutes extra for picking up at other hotels near by. Not a problem. We arrived at the hotel around 11:30pm and the door was locked. It appeared that guests can open the door with their room keys. We were let in by two other guests while the check-in clerk was busy and didn't see us outside (they probably would have if we knocked harder or stayed there longer). The room was clean but a bit noisy from street noise for a 2nd floor room. We were moved to a higher floor the next night without any problem. Just left the packed luggage in the original room and they moved us to a new room later that day. The sound insulation was terrible. We could hear almost everything on the hallway. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We left a small tip on the night stand but the cleaning staff never took it. The room is very clean. The bed and bedding are comfortable. The bathroom is small but adequate. I do have problems with it doesn't have an exhaust fan and the toilet is far too close to the wall on the side. Additionally, I'm not a big guy but my shoulder was up against the wall while sitting on it. The gym and the pool are both on the rooftop. I swam in the pool and it's small but okay. Although it claims to be a four star hotel, I really think it's a very good 3-star one. There are no house phones in each floor so I have to go downstairs three times (my cell roaming rate is $2/min and I didn't remember the hotel number) when my room key stopped working, which is another problem.

I stayed there in April 2010 for 6 nights . My standard room was a good size and would be happily spacious enough for 2 people without feeling cramped. It was well equipped with a generous amount of wardrobe space and a clean, modern bathroom/shower with toiletries, widescreen tv, safe, well stocked fridge, hairdryer, iron /ironing board - in fact everything you need. The bed was very comfortable and the decor is 'funky modern' ,but not overwhelmingly so. My travelling companion had booked an executive suite and it was more like an apartment - very generous in size with a jacuzzi bath. We had found very good rates on Expedia - better than booking direct. Just a small warning - if you book an Executive suite , they are situated on the roof terrace floor and the lift stops one floor below -so you will have to lug your luggage up a couple of short flights of stairs to get to your suite. ( Or find someone to do it for you!) The roof terrace is a haven after a hot day sightseeing -with sunbeds and a clean well maintained pool. There are tables and chairs to one side at a slightly lower level which also serve as a smoking area. Next to the roof terrace area is a small inside gym with several fitness machines. If you don't want to pay hotel room broadband rates, there are 3 terminals in reception at cheaper rates . Or you can sit on the roof terrace with your netbook/laptop and try surfing for some free wifi.... Food : the Vibe's Curve cafe provides breakfast, lunch and evening options and snacks throughout the day - it also has a well stocked bar. For cheaper breakfast eats there is also a cafe serving less expensive choices at the hotel directly adjoining the Vibe. If you want a decent evening meal and don't want to 'eat in ' or walk too far - directly across the road from reception is the Crown Hotel. Despite looking like a regular 'pub' , this has an absolute treasure of a bistro restaurant upstairs. Linen table cloths, good service and cosy ambience and fantastically good hearty bistro style food at very reasonable prices. I had some of the best Aussie fish n chips there I've ever had. My friend and I ate there 3 times! Highly recommended. Sightseeing / location. Darling Harbour and Chinatown are an easy walk and so is Oxford Street. But for heading down towards the Harbour - the new(ish) FREE shuttle bus is literally a couple of minutes away on Elizabeth Street . Route 555 will take you down to the Quay and back again. Or drop you off outside David Jones if you want to indulge in some shopping therapy. It runs every 10 minutes throughout the day and some evenings, and at weekends too. All info and bus times here : http://www.sydneybuses.info/free-cbd-shuttle.htm All in all, The Vibe is a very reasonabley priced, easy and convenient choice for Sydney - it is modern but with more character than a 'conference hotel' , clean, comfortable and friendly and I would certainly stay there again.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat value but a little dated.\u201d", "Author": "FlatironsTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR65665684", "Content": "The Vibe's best feature is the location: a few blocks away from Chinatown for superb and reasonably priced food while smack between the Museum and Central Station stop for the train to / from the airport.

The breakfast area is large and comfortable with a pleasant selection of food and free newspapers. The only gripe was the poor coffee from the machine but a lovely coffee can be purchased and delivered to you from the connected cafe/bar (part of Vibe). The standard room we stayed in had heaps of storage and a lovely hot powerful shower. The room was not luxurious but was certainly modern and spacious enough. The bed initially seemed quite firm and 'springy' but it was fine once we actually slept on it. Just not what we are used to. We slept very well. There was some street noise but minor. We were on the 5th level. We take earplugs anyway. We were concerned that our room was directly opposite the lifts. On our first afternoon we found it quite noisy as people exitedly headed out. We asked if they could move us and without any drama said they would do so next day. We appreciated their attitude about this. After our first night it didnt seem like such a problem to us so we stayed put. Again they were very polite about it. The reception staff were very efficient and professional without any fake gushiness. There is daily room service, Th Vibe is 1 block from the Museum train station which can take you into Circular Quay or to the Airport. It is at the Southern end of the CBD and is an easy walk to Hyde park, Botanic Gardens, Darling Harbour, shops, Musuems etc. We really loved the handy location. We dont mind a bit of walking. The Vibe is a clean, modern (renovated) and well priced hotel in a useful part of one of the most attractive cities in the world. You dont get a broad harbour view or a concierge tripping over you so if you want to feel special you need to go get a room in one of the international chains for another $200 per night.

I wanted somewhere near to a City Rail station (which it is, Museum Station is just a few minutes up the the road) with an outdoor swimming pool and not at a huge cost in the city centre. The Vibe was a great choice. I arrived late in the evening at around 10.30pm from a long and tiring flight from London and had pre-paid via Expedia.co.uk and got a bed and breakfast rate. It was around \u00c2\u00a385 a night, which wasn't expensive for what I got. For two people staying in the same room it would have obviously cost less, per person sharing. Staff are all friendly and helpful. The room I had was obviously for two people or even three, as it was a spacious standard twin room, with two large beds, a sofa, large flatscreen TV and plenty of floor space. There was also a hallway and large walk in closet with mini bar next to it and a good size bathroom. The rooms at The Vibe are trendy, modern design. The whole hotel is aimed at a young, fashionable clientele and the lobby is almost like an art museum, trendy and very well designed. As it was sunny, warm weather in Sydney for the first couple of days I was there and stayed in The Vibe. I did spend some time on the sundeck and swam in the rooftop swimming pool. It was quiet and very private, with a gym down some steps below and a sauna. Breakfast was good, but it was very busy and a bit noisy in the restaurant. Orange juice had run out and hot chocolate had ran out from the machine, so I had to wait a while before the hostess had a chance to bring me a chocolate drink already made. Apart from that, there was lots of choice and a full cooked buffet, with fresh fruit and lots of breads, muffins and rolls. One let down was the wireless internet connection in the rooms, which was a ridiculous $25 a day to use, or $56 for three days, which I paid for, but got cut off suddenly. The reception had to call the outside internet provider company to complain and re-connect me without charging me again. I was annoyed when I first got told by a man at front desk that I was supposed to call the helpine myself, but it wouldn't cost me a lof of credit on my Australian mobile phone and I didn't see why I should pay extra costs for something that wasn't my error. Eventually they re-connected me and was told that I would not be charged again, but on check out I was disgusted to see that I had been charged twice for the three day connection, that was $112 just for internet connection on my laptop. The reception then had to call the company that provided the service to get a refund. What a hassle just to get internet on my laptop! Why the hell can't it just be FREE?! The internet connection expense is the only negative factor about this hotel, it's perfectly located for sightseeing Sydney and walking distance to Hyde Park, Oxford Street and all around the CBD. The train from Museum station to Circular Quay station where the harbour, Opera House and The Rocks are all located is just a couple of stops away and relaxing by the outdoor pool in the Sydney sunshine is ideal. I would stay here again, for sure, but they need to scap extra charges on using our computers in our rooms.

Not friendly & they were extremely rude. - Room service - We stayed there for 7 nights and they only changed the bed sheets ONCE!!! When we made a complain at the front-desk, they just ignored us and gave us a look.

When we requested for a late checkout, they wanted to charge us 1/3 of the full day price PER HOUR!!! We even found socks & underwear at the top shelf (where they placed the extra pillow)!!! - VERY NOISY!

We had been spoilt on our first trip to Sydney staying in the Four Seasons. We chose this hotel however as we had seen enough of Circular Quay and wanted to be nearer Darling Harbour. Upon our arrival we were shown to our room which overlooked a multi-storey car park and was dim and unpleasant. The lady at reception however was amenable when we asked to move and eventually we got an OK room on the fourth floor. The room itself was tidy enough although slightly strangely set out with a partition in front of the bathroom. This is a city hotel and it is not really near much except for the South end of Hyde Park so be prepared to do some walking. We knew where it was though and weren't expecting the earth. However, what really did let this hotel down was the service and staff. While the lady who booked us in was helpful, nobody else really seemed to care much about the guests. The bar was closed early most evenings and when I asked for a drink the bar staff seemed to resent it. The concierge was continually absent and we had to wait outside at night to be let back into the hotel at 11pm. Where the hotel really let us down was after-sales however. We booked our trip to the airport through the hotel and were collected correctly. However we have found that we have been charged twice for this, once by the bus company and once by the hotel. Unfortunately we did not find this out until we were back in the UK. I had to send 3 emails to various Vibe email addresses before I got any response from the hotel. The response I got however was basically \"not our problem mate\" despite the fact they were the ones who booked the hotel. When I asked for further details on how to proceed in this matter the hotel manager, Eugene Human ceased communicating and did not respond.

The ongoing housekeeping services were equally disappointing. The internet is ridiculously expensive ($90 for 10 hours of access) and no wi-fi is available in-room. The walls are paper-thin, so even the smallest amount of noise can be very disruptive. The staff was friendly, but not terribly skilled. When I checked in, I told the guy at the front desk that I wanted to pay my bill with cash. He said that I had to register a credit card for security. Fair enough, so I did. About 15 minutes after I got to my room, a receipt was slipped under my door showing that all eight days of my stay had already been charged to the credit card. I went to the desk to complain, and they were quick to correct the mistake a refund my money. But when all was said and done, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d lost $50 US from currency exchange charges on their error. With so many options for accommodations in this city, there must be something of comparable price that is much better. Knowing what I know now, I would have spent more per day to have confidence in the cleanliness of my room, rather than worry about when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find the next discarded medical supply.

We arrived early Sunday morning and cabbed it (too tired to train) and the guys at the hotel were v efficient, trying to get us an early available room, but we were happy to do a quick wash & change and head straight to Manly for sun and sand. Got back later that evening and our bags had been taken to a big room, surprisingly big and comfy. Big bed, nice flatscreen, power shower, huge wardrobe. Suited us just fine. We planned to stay just 6 nights, but booked in the full 12 night stay! It's so convenient, close to the main streets in Sydney - Pitt, George and Castlereagh streets. Cross over and you're in the right direction for the harbour - good 20min walk though, otherwise catch a bus and it's 5-6 mins. Trains to CQ via Museum station (near Hyde Park - 5 mins away) or pop down George St for Town Hall station with trains to North Sydney. Easy peasy. Get a 'green' 7-day travel pass for travel on buses/trains/ferries (forget the Sydney Explorer, just a tourist con). Kiosk near CQ. Despite it's tourist connatations, the Rocks rocks - forget The Orient (they threw us out for no reason, they get a lot of trouble apparently and target pommies!) and head to Hero of Waterloo, The Australian, The Glenmore and The Mercantile for good drinks and watching the world go by. Good eats there at the Rocks Cafe (I think - big cakes in the window so easy to spot); Italian cafe that I've forgotten name of and BBQ place - all good. Don't forget to take ferry to Manly - try Garfish for lovely seafood there, most excellent and you can BYO! Oh, and dress up and go to the 36th floor of the Shangri La Hotel in the Rocks for the best view ever and Toblerone cocktails! Also the Ocean Room near the Overseas Passenger Teminal does lovely, good value Japanese-inspired seafood as well. So many lovely places. Breakfast just about anyway is yummy if a little pricey. For trips, take bus up to Palm Beach on northern beaches, tranquil and lovely houses. Oh and forget Bondi and head to Bronte Beach instead, much nicer and have lunch at Cafe Selina (?).

I also didn't have much a view, but that really didn't bother me at all. Another friend booked a Master Suite and that room was MASSIVE and had a better view. I didn't try the restaurant, so can't comment. I did peep at the pool and gym upstairs, which were small but really cute and seemed equipped well enough. Didn't use either facility. Checkout was very fast. I did call for concierge to help bring our bags down, but we were in a hurry as our shuttle had arrived half an hour earlier than expected, so I didn't have the time to wait for them and lugged the luggage down via the lifts myself. All in all, I was very satisfied with Vibe Hotel and will definitely stay here again.

But that is all I can say about positive aspects of the hotel. The 'classy' rooftop swimming pool is more like a giant bath tub, and when I was there, there was only one man sun tanning. Not surprisingly, as the water in the pool did not look well-maintained. Vibe hotel is a business hotel for business people, but that was definitely not the impression I got. First of all, the internet was not working, and it takes on average 3 phone calls and 30 min before getting any of your requests attended to. The person who helped us with the internet has no basic knowledge about the internet... When we checked out, we were billed A$40 for internet charges (we only used internet to syn up our email..). We thought that the wireless internet at the lounge was complimentary since the internet in our room was down, but we were told that that was impossible and were treated as freeloathers. When I requested to look at the internet log files (I am still holding onto the log file), I saw that we were charged A$20 for 8min of internet usage!! The manager on duty, Mr. Godwin Oparah, was not only unhelpful, but was very rude to us. He accused us of lying and argued with us for more than 10 min. We were catching our flight, so this last episode totally ruined whatever good impression we had of the hotel. To rate him and his staff's service and attitude, on a scale of 0 to 10, I would give them a low 1.5. Out of the 5 counter staff I spoke to, only one of them was polite and professional.

Come down at about 8am and you struggle to get a table or near the buffet. A lot of Germans seem to stay in this hotel, but maybe they were there as part of a tour group. The bar food was excellent. Modern, contemporary dishes - loved the green Thai curry, duck and risotto's. Also try the tapas dishes!
