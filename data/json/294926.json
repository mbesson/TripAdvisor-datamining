Breakfast was a real treat. In addition to the usual breads and pastries, they had hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fresh fruit, and many delicious cheeses and olives. The cold-weather setting for breakfast was a large, well-lit restaurant with many windows on the top floor. What really makes this a terrific hotel option is its proximity to the sites. We were on a quiet street yet only two blocks from the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Archeological Museum, and the tram. We easily walked to the Suleiman the Magnificant Mosque and the Grand Bazaar.

As a regular traveller to Istanbul, I can easily say that this warm boutique hotel in the middle of Istabul's historic peninsula is the best hotel experience I have had in Istanbul. The hotel experience is about location, comfort and service. Artefes Hotel gets 10/10 in all three. Its location in the Sultanahmet district means its in the most touristic region of the city and within convenient reach of any part of Istanbul using public transport. Within walking distance to shops, bazaars and touristic facilities, its location simply allows one to reach in any direction of Istanbul without expensive or multi connecting means of transportation. Put simply, this translates into time saving. Artefes has offered me a 5 star comfort level consistently - my fourth stay in this hotel is a testament to this fact. Beautiful and practical rooms, a welcoming and warm breakfast environment, and a terrace for your morning or evening tea or coffee, with a view of the Marmara Sea - the comfort offered was simply outstanding and immensely pleasurable. Ultimately however, its all about service, and Artefes again scored 5 stars from me. Its staff share a set of common qualities that one notices right from the initial encounter: Friendliness, the willingness to help and pure professionalism in their dealings with guests. You will notice this with your first contact with the Artefes reception desk - you'll feel welcome straightaway. The attention is personalised and your needs are anticipated. The feeling you will have is that, its your home away from home, but theres always a friendly and willing person to assist you with any issues you may have. I have had a very comfortable and wonderful holidaying experience in Istanbul. Artefes was definitely a major contributor to this pleasurable stay.

The roof terrace has the Blue Mosque one one side and the Sea of Marmara and views of the Bosphorus on the other, a perfect location when you want to relax. The hotel itself has an adequate lobby and is decorated to a very high standard, with a lot of thought in the designs and considerable Turkish influence throughout. We were very pleased to discover it was perhaps the cleanest hotel we had ever stayed at, absolutely squeaky clean and was always maintained that way during our week long stay. Our room was typical of Turkish hotels and a little on the small side, but perfectly adequate and like the rest of the hotel kept totally clean with a constant supply of fresh linen and towels. The bathroom was small but again adequate and as a hospital inspector I can say it was very, very clean, even in those places most people don't dare to look. The breakfast buffet service was very comprehensive with a constant supply of food. The basic things were always there, again typically Turkish with breads, cheeses and meats, accompanied by yoghurt, cakes and cereals as well as hot foods. Each day the regular items were supplemented by a choice of other dishes which provided excellent variety and a chance to try something new each day. The best thing about the hotel however are the staff. Everyone without exception was very friendly and keen to provide an excellent service which they all did, especially Tunjai who gave us some fantastic ideas about where to go, how to get there and what to see. He made our holiday a really fantastic trip. It's a privately owned hotel and the owner is there on hand at any time to chat to you although you'll probably think he's just another member of staff - again ensuring your time there is everything you want it to be. It has top hotel service but with a friendly feeling which the big hotels miss out. We felt at home.

So I looked at the reviews a little more closely and realised that all the positive 5 star reviews are from people with only 1 contribution on Tripadvisor. Also, despite some of them claiming to be American (and so presumably native English speakers), most of them seem to make the same basic grammatical mistakes as one another! The truth is that this is a very basic hotel but I guess you get what you pay for. The rooms are clean but not impeccably so e.g. the floor is not hoovered every day etc. The claim that they have aircon is a joke. Not only is it totally ineffective when it's on, but the electricity in the room only works when the key is in a slot by the door, so it's off all day while you're out and the room becomes a sauna! Wi-fi access is another exaggerated claim. It only works in one half of the lobby although I did have intermittent access to a random network next door from my room. Breakfast, so often praised by other reviewers, was terrible and we ignored it on most days. Terrible bread, limited choice of fruit (just some watermelon and grapes). Processed meat and cheese and a basic cold scrambled eggs and fried sausage selection. They also don't seem to replenish the buffet as it gets eaten so you have to arrive early to have any chance of finding something half-way decent. The staff are nice and very helpful and speak decent English, but be careful of taking any of their recommendations. The reception staff will push all manner of tours on you and against our better judgement we accepted one which promised a Bosphorous cruise along with tours of a couple of palaces (unfortunately I can't remember the name of the operator). The tour started late and so missed out one of the palaces. However, they did find time to effectively kidnap everyone and take us to a leather wholesaler in the middle of nowhere, where they forced us to watch a \"fashion show\" and tried to hard sell us leather jackets!! The hotel staff clearly know the tours are rubbish as once we returned they never asked us about our experience and never tried to offer us anything again. Having said that, I would definitely recommend a Bosphorous cruise.
