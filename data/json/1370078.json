We had to leave at 6 am this morning to catch an early flight so couldn't make it for breakfast (served from 8:30 am till 10:30 am) but staff provided us with a tray in our room and fresh food in the fridge so we didn't have to leave on an empty stomach. It's true the reception is not covered at night but we got very clear instructions on how to open/close to entrance to the courtyard and there's a number you can call for assistance.

My daughter and I arrived at 8:30 pm to find our keys laying out on the desk with a note to take our key and go to our room. They said the front desk is not covered after 6:00 pm. They require all guests to leave their keys in a bowl at the desk in the lobby when leaving the hotel. The hotel door is open and anyone could walk in and go into anyones room. I felt very unsafe. Not only was there a safety issue, but the room was horrible. Our room was on first floor directly behind the checkin desk. The bed was a double, which two people would be bumping butts all night long, and no comforter only a very thin dirty looking spread. If I wanted to compare this hotel to one we are all familiar with, I'd say the Holiday Inn would feel like the Ritz compared to the Al Canal Regio Hotel. They did not truthfully represent their hotel on their website. It is nothing like the photos. Which makes everything worse is the young man who we spoke with the next day was rude and unreasonable. We never stayed in the our room and they would not reimburse us for any of the three nights. I could not stay in a hotel which had such a security issue. We used our Iphone and found another hotel that evening and quickly moved over to the Sofitel which is a beautiful hotel. The bed was a king size with a comforter which was huge and fluffy. I would strongly recommend not booking the Al Canal Regio Hotel. You will be disappointed and they could care less. The Al Canal Regio Hotel is unsafe, dirty and with rude staff.

Thanks to this courtyard, we could open our outsidedoor day and night! It is true that the receptionist is not present anymore from 6 pm on, but be honest: do you really need a receptionist at night? In short: the hotel has a great location moreover it is very quiet in this area. The room was cozy and well furnished and our bathroom very modern and tidy.

This hotel is good value for money. The standard is excellent for this type of hotel, and comparable to other hotels I have stayed at in Italy. The photos do do justice to the hotel. The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful, both on the phone before we arrived and for our entire stay of five days. Although the water heating broke, they tried everything to get it repaired, but this is Italy, and Venice, and they could not get a plumber to come out on a Sunday, this is usual for Italy, and for such things they need to be treated as part of the 'adventure' and do not blame the hotel. The so called 'alley' on other comments is a Venitian street, it is small, but you have come to Venice, and are in a residential area. The hotel is excellent for being quiet, away from the crowds of tourists, off the main street, but close to the water bus stop for easy access or for walking to main sites. The hotel is wheelchair accessible, but does not have any special adaptations, so if you can weight bare this is a very good option. Although a lot of Venice will be difficult there are accessible options and ramped bridges in some parts. Some bridges do have platform lifts for wheelchairs, but we did not find one that worked. There is one 'assisted' bridge between the hotel and the water bus at Ca d'Oro I was able to get over this both in a powered wheelchair and being pushed, with very little difficulty. For others with mobility difficulties a ground floor room here is an excellent option. We did opt, despite the expense, to have a water taxi to get from the train station as we did not know where things were, or the accessibility (I recomend Flavio in taxi 21) but got the water bus back with no problem. All water buses are accessible, but be prepared for them to be very crowded. All the bus staff help you get on and off and were in the main great. The breakfast was very good and an Italian continental breakfast there was enough and the staff replenished if things ran out. Near by there are several excellent restaurants and I recomend Osteria Al Osti as accessible and apart from teh one before mentioned bridge no steps to get to. Very very good quality food and prices very very reasonable for Venice, a pasta dish with fresh sea food costs about 12 euros. Luigi is teh fantastic waiter and be prepared for a laugh. I would stringly recommend this hotel to people, but do adivse to remember this is Italy life goes at a different pace. Star ratings do not mean the same as other places. I understand looking at the bad comments they were mostly from last minute bookers, remember in Europe if you book at the last minute you will usually get a small room in the attic if you want the access you need to book as early as possible with the hotel or booking.com etc", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTerrible place\u201d", "Author": "footie1990", "ReviewID": "UR119084712", "Content": "Just came back form Italy.

The hotel is in a typical Venetian house and area. It was not difficult to find, the area (Cannaregio) was very safe and lively with good shops and restaurants as well as the only McDonalds in Venice nearby (if that's your thing). Our room was nicely furnished but not as luxurious as it seems on the web site (it photographs deceivingly well). We had an in room safe with an outlet for a notebook computer but the outlet did not work. The TV was nice but had no English channels (same at Casa Martini). Not a big deal. The bed is two single beds pushed together, pretty typical for a European hotel. My one complaint about the room was that it was not well cleaned. The floors were dirty, as well as table surfaces. Bathroom was adequate but had that annoying shower head that does not set into the wall so had to be held the entire time. Two towels and two hand towels were provided but no bath mat or face cloths. Water pressure and temperature were fine. Our room overlooked the street below as well as the private courtyard of one of the superior rooms. Air conditioning worked great and windows were large and bright. The hotel itself has a small interior courtyard which was plain and had filing cabinets and other miscellaneous materials stored in it (not very luxurious looking). The room where breakfast was served was comfortable. Breakfast was hot drinks, juices (dispensed), cereal, croissants, biscuits, cured meat, sliced cheese, yogurt, canned pineapple, dates, etc. Unfortunately when we arrived for breakfast (8:30 am) there were no clean dishes left so we had to eat our food on napkins. Breakfast should have been better organized. We had a similar problem at Casa Martini - except that there were no dishes left and no food left at 9 am. Staff were fine to deal with (don't except anything too friendly, this is Europe after all, and that's part of the charm!) Spoke fairly good English. Keys had to be left in a bowl at reception but this is fairly normal for European hotels and we found it to be fine. There is no 24 hour reception at this hotel so you must buzz at the front door to gain access after reception hours. Again, fairly normal. Overall, using trendy furnishings and a nice web site does not make a hotel luxurious. This hotel is probably not worth the price (in high season). If you're going to stay in Venice do it right - its a beautiful city and where you stay does impact your overall impression of your vacation in the end.

Well when we arrived I was in total shock, nothing at all like the website pictures, within minutes my son could not breath with asthma and had to go outside. I myself could not have slept there. I told the young man that took us there I was not staying there and then we headed back to reception. When while I leave my family at McDonalds whilst I sort it out. Our friendly reception man was not so friendly now and said that I could have the only room left, i said we wont all fit he said 3 in double bed and 1 in roll away I asked for a extra roll away but he said no and I would need to pay for another room (so now they do have other rooms). I asked to see the other room, both very basic rooms right on reception, back I go to the family and we look online for another hotel and then decided after travelling already for 9 hours we had had enough so just pay the extra which a lastminute special on their website advertised 80 euro. So back I go to the hotel to organise it, when I arrive I said okay we will take the extra room, but now he wants to charge more...... I said your own website says 80 euro, he said well go back to your family and book it then...

However, 'small' does not begin to describe the cupboard-sized attic room we were given, which had barely enough room to move round the bed let alone put suitcases anywhere - you had to clamber over them to get round the room.

To top it all off we were locked out of our room on the first evening when the neighbouring room closed the door preventing us from getting to our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had to rummage around the front desk for a key, not sure who was monitoring the 24 hour CCTV at this point, but they must have fallen asleep. All in all a very weird set up for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cCanal View Room - Very Noisy & Mouldy Bathroom\u201d", "Author": "jennifer_laura", "ReviewID": "UR83349971", "Content": "This hotel is situated down a small alley riddled with urine and rubbish, also if you are following the hotels website directions they forget to mention the final detail; .......then take the first calle (street) on the left, after this they fail to mention you need to then take the next right turn and you will then see the hotel after around 10 metres.

During our stay with the hotel I noticed the front gates are left open during the day with no reception staff. All the room keys are just left in a bowl on the front desk totally unattended so basically anyone can come and gain access to your room! We booked the canal view room, we both liked the general modern decor of the room and the view was very nice. I was disappointed to see a long stretch of mould on the ceiling in the bathroom and mould around the bottom of the shower. Don't expect to get a good nights sleep in this room, you can hear clear conversations in the rooms to the side and above you, also the breakfast room is next door so you will be woken up by everyone eating their breakfast. We liked the idea that there was an onsite bar, where we could get ready of an evening, have a couple of drinks and onto a restaraunt.

The down sides were that the air con wasn't very effective and even though we went in Sept, it was still hot at night. There is a fridge in the room which was great to keep drinks cool in (supermarket at back of hotel much cheaper than street vendors).

Its website claims it is a high class boutique hotel, but I found it to be nothing more than a substandard bed and breakfast. We arrived with our friends at 7.00pm, it was pouring with rain and we were very tired after our journey. We were buzzed in through the awful gates by a security guard (not on site, I must add but at their sister hotel about 10 minutes away.) We stood in the reception area alone for about 15 minutes waiting for somebody to arrive and check us in. When the guy finally arrived he was not apologetic at all and just said that he had been at the other hotel as if we were upset for no reason. We were let into our rooms both Junior suites and at the top of their tariff. The room was small with a mezzanine level with a double bed covered in a cheap and nasty bedspread. The bathroom was miniscule with the most ridiculous shower built into a sloping ceiling. Luckily, both my husband and myself are short people as anyone over 5'6\" would have their head touching the ceiling!! The toiletries are cheap rubbish, no robes were provided even though we paid extra for them, threadbare, hard towels and the bathroom was not cleaned during our 5 night stay. The whole room was grubby and the floors were filth,y the bottoms of our feet were black from walking on them. The Television had a terrible picture and was just local tv not the satelite Tv advertised on their website The TV by the bed was locked on Child controls with no remote control to turn it off, we just had to unplug it at the walll in the end. The self service breakfast is awful, revolting croissants or a rock hard bread roll are your choices all served in the hall of the hotel where you have to perch on a tiny stool. They don't even have anyone serving coffee, its just a coffee machine like the type you find in a service station, just can't believe you don't get decent coffee in Italy!! We did complain about all of these things while we were at the hotel and the manager Michael was extremely unhelpful, he did nothing to rectify our complaints and simply shrugged and said we have to request all the things we wanted even though they are listed as standard on our room grade description. Probably the most alarming point about this hotel is that there are never any staff present. The front gates are left open during the day with no reception staff. All the room keys are just left in a bowl on the front desk totally unattended. Anybody could wander in and let themselves into your room! To finish off all I can say is that had we been paying for a cheap B&B at cheap prices then that would have been fine but we were paying top prices and could have stayed at one of venices premier hotels for the same money.

When we got there we were very impressed with the decor, however we didn't arrive till midnight and the person who checked us in literally took our passports and showed us our room, which was right next to reception, we weren't told anything except how to sort the heating. Having got there very late we went straight to bed, but is was quite annoyed when at half 7 in the morning the phone was ringing constantly, and it wasn't quiet!! As we were so close to reception we could hear everything they were doing. When we were leaving our room the next day we noticed there was an upstairs, my boyfriend went and looked and there was a sofa bed, and another bathroom, we thought it may be a living area for us. However when we returned from our outing it was locked. Later on we heard someone being shown to the room and they didn't seem to impressed to have a room with a sofa bed! I don't blame them! We also found when we returned that our room had been left unlocked when the maid had made the beds! Apparently all the residents are meant to leave the room keys in the bowl on the reception desk, but we never did as reception was very rarely manned, they were always in a little room at the back and we only saw someone on reception when we left!! We were never informed of what we were able to do, there was a room across the courtyard with a coffee machine and cups and glasses, we didn't know if we could use them as we were never told and could never find anybody to ask! There is a supermarket, McDonalds and loads of little cafe's and restaurants on the main street from the hotel and even more over to Rialto bridge, these are quite well priced and if you don't want to spend a fortune don't eat around St. Marks square. However Hard Rock Cafe is a must!!! We had 2 massive meals and didn't mid paying 45euros! Also if you like your shopping St. Marks square is grea, Chanel, Prada, Luis Vuitton, Fendi, Gucci, D&G, Bvlgari, Cartier! Everything a girl could want! We went on a gondola but didn't shop around for prices, we used one of the guys who stood on the little bridges arond the streets her charged 100euros for a 45minute tour of the Grand Canal, Rialto Bridge, and lots of little street canals where certain people lived...eg. Casa Nova!!! Ha. Venice is a lovely place to visit, some beautiful sites, plan what you want to do before you go, we paid 33euros each for a 72 hours waterbus pass, which probably wasn't needed in the end as apart from the airport and bus station everything is in walking distance. We flew to Treviso Airport and got a bus from outside which is in conjunction with the flight, we paid 18euros for 2 return tickets and this took us to the bus station where you then get a waterbus to Ca D'oro.
