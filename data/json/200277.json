The staff are friendly, the location is central, the breakfast is impressive and the Wifi is free. If I was to have one small complaint it\u2019s that the rooms are basic and the furniture is dated.

The location is very good, situated in a quiet street leading down to the Spree river but also within walking distance of museums, Under den Linden and the S Bahn at Friedrichstrasse. Staff were efficient but friendly. Breakfast was a particularly good - wide ranging selection on a par with 5 star hotels. The only reason I have not given the room a higher rating is that they are obviously in the process of refurbishing the rooms and the room I had had not yet been done - nevertheless it was a good size and comfortable. I had a quiet room overlooking the courtyard (charmiing) but I think the rooms facing the road would have been fine as both streets were very quiet. At the end of the road and facing the river, there are a good range of restaurants, so no need to travel far to eat. The hotel restaurant also looked very good. Would recommend this hotel for the combination of location, friendliness and quality. It has a sister hotel across the road (Allegra) - worth considering if you can't get in at the Albrechtshof.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cologne", "Title": "\u201cSolid 3-Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "bassreisende", "ReviewID": "UR96041050", "Content": "The Hotel Albrechtshof is a nice hotel in Berlin-Mitte. The room was comfortable and quiet. There is a double door to the hallway to keep elevator noise out. It's on a side street, so the street noise isn't bad. The breakfast was good, although the service was somewhat lax. Generally, I found the front desk personnel also to be a little less friendly and service oriented than I'm used to in big city hotels.

A wonder Arabic restaurant is just a couple of streets away on Claire Waldorf Strasse (but take cash); likewise with Thai food. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and the staff very accommodating.
