Solo traveller, felt nice and safe to leave my things. Helpful staff and wifi in room. I hada single bed and small tv and desk. perfect if you want just a nice place to be based while exploring the city- there are also some good pizza places around which are cheap and excellent, 4 euros for a large pizza! There are also lots of bakeries that sell coffee for the morning- this is important to me! If you want to go out late there are lots of night buses that run to Zoo which isn't far.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens", "Title": "\u201cGood if you are on a budget\u201d", "Author": "yiotadelta", "ReviewID": "UR127077342", "Content": "The hotel looks modern and actually has a nice reception area.

Two or three bus stops away from the ZooGarden, 4 minute walk to the first subway/bus station. Anyway, you got it, it's well located. I like rooms to be big, so I went for the junior suite, which was spacious (~30m\u00b2), clean and comfortable. Bathroom was well-design although a mild piping smell kept coming and going for the first two nights. It was manageable but rather unpleasant. The art in the room was to my liking. As a matter of fact, I requested the room with the artwork I had seen on their website. And got that very room. Breakfast was kinda poor after 9, but that doesn't really matter, you're in Berlin, don't eat breakfast at the hotel... please. Personnel service was uneven. Some receptionists were incredibly nice, others were practically rude. Got a good deal on the room, all in all it was a good stay. Berlin is known for its cheap private appartments rentals, but in case you want hotel services, don't hesitate much about this one. The little russian restaurant nearby serves surprisingly delicious food, but don't expect them to understand you if you don't speak german.

We came in our room: it was opened and the key was on the table. our stuff and cams were stolen. We came to the reception (haven't closed the room) and asked to call the police. He dialed one strange phone number and only after that called the police. After it we have found our stuff in the room, but not the cigarettes and some other stuff (like UF filter for my cam..) The manager recommended us to change the room (same category) and cancel police call. At the check-out we have been charged for the room price again.
