We were attending a conference at the nearby auditorium and this place was well-placed, reasonably priced and highly-rated by guests. We booked 4 rooms and were absolutely delighted- and the envy of all our colleagues who paid much more for poorer quality accommodation. The area is a wonderful upscale neighbourhood- out of the centre which is a plus but well-served by public transport- we left the centre at midnight one evening and were at Oriani 20 minutes later (taxi fare about 12 euros). The rooms are slightly different in size- mine was on the ground floor and enormous with a little veranda, high ceiling, walk-in wardrobe and tastefully-furnished throughout. Breakfast is served in your room between 8 and 10 although they can manage slightly earlier or later if you need it. As we were a group we'd have preferred to eat together but there was no communal place to have breakfast. No big deal though and breakfast in your room particularly if a couple is a wonderful treat. Bruno, Alessandro and Vittoria are totally charming and extermely helpful. Our booked taxi to take us back to the airport let us down and Bruno drove us in his own car- it was more expensive than we would have paid but we really felt rescued and extermely grateful. I have been to Rome several times and have enjoyed almost every place I've stayed- but this place really is the best- I won't look for anywhere else (particularly if I can get the room I had this time!)", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, California", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "ItaliaTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR111209821", "Content": "All in all I very much enjoyed the stay. The convenience of having a limo driver meet us at the airport (and then take us back) was a great relief after a long plane trip from San Francisco. The location is very nicely situated away from the center of Rome but within an easy metro ride into the city. My husband and I were in Rome for the Italian Open and found that we could walk a rather easy 45 minute walk to the Foro Italico. Good exercise before and after a lot of tennis watching! I especially enjoyed being in a real Roman neighborhood. When we went to local restaurants, we were the only non-Italians usually. The neighborhood restauarants were very good (esp. Duke's). Vittoria is a gem. She took care of all our breakfasts and logistical needs...I agree with other reviewers: she is special and makes the place all the more worth staying at! The room was clean and suitable. As so often is the case in Italy, we could smell cigarette smoke wafting up through the window. As non-smokers this was troubling, but it's hard to avoid this in Rome. The floors are wood and noise travels readily. When other guests are polite and respectful, there is little problem, but this is not always the case. When we arrived, exhausted from our travels, we encountered other guests who were very loud with their t.v. and conversation. We used our sound machine to drown out the noise, but unfortunately, we were also too loud and were politely advised the next day not to use it again....There were subsequent outbursts of noise from other guests, but with ear plugs, one can generally block out the noise. And finally, the free Wi-fi was very convenient!

The rooms are extremely clean and comfortable. The location is definitely away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist district in Rome, which is exactly what we wanted, but anyone who doesn't mind doing a bit of walking can get to any of the major tourist sites from the hotel. My mother, who is in her 70s and in good physical condition, had no difficulty walking to lovely locations like the Villa Borghese, Piazza del Popolo, the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, etc. We didn't want to be right in the middle of the tourist sites, but we found them very easy to get to from Suite Oriani. We had a lot of fun by just buying an all day bus pass and seeing where they went, which is by far the easiest way of seeing Rome at the street level. We found some really nice restaurants this way. We found the breakfast that is served to you in your room to be very filling and tasty. The hotel is very quiet at night. You may close the window shutters and your room will be completely dark, which is my preference for good sleep. The staff are all very friendly and will help you with any problem that you may have. Do not expect the staff to be waiting at the front desk at all hours. This is not that kind of place. The family who owns the property also live there and they need their time off as well. The only thing that Suite Oriani lacks is an outdoor sitting area for guests. We solved this problem by using Alessandro's desk on the front porch of hotel where we could drink our wine at night (thanks Alessandro!). He seemed not to mind. It would be nice to have a small table and some chairs somewhere where we could enjoy the evening air. Prior to our arrival in Rome, we were the victims of a pickpocket in Naples. Some cash and credit cards were liberated from us. I must thank Alessandro for being very helpful by assisting us with closing the credit card accounts. He allowed us to use his cell phone, laptop computer and Skype account to call the US for a problem with adding more minutes to our rented cell phone (Cellular Abroad, which I DO NOT recommend). Alessandro was very patient and kind with us. I can't understand the terrible review that was written by the lady from Ohio. Her review is simply is not accurate. For those who must remain connected to the Internet, wireless Internet access is available at no additional cost at Suite Oriani. We enjoyed our meals at Taverna Rossini (www.tavernarossini.it) at 54 Viale G. Rossini (Tel 06 84242903) and also at \"La Pariolina\" (Alessandro can direct you to this restaurant). There are many more restaurants, but these two places we enjoyed very much. A final note that is unrelated to Suite Oriani. Having a cell phone in Italy is very helpful, but I found Cellular Abroad to be a ripoff. It cost $125 to rent a phone for 2 weeks. We ran out of minutes during the pickpocket incident and the phone call cut off a just the wrong moment. It was very difficult to add more minutes to the phone, which is why I had to use Alessandro's Skype to call the US. Even the Skype representative had some difficulty adding the minutes. Finally, it cost me $24 dollars to add a balance of 10 Euro to the phone. Do the math if the exchange rate is 1 Euro For $1.25. By my calculation, I should have received about 19 Euro credit, but I only got 10 Euro and the other 9 Euro went to their profit. NICE! Buy a throwaway in Italy or temporarily add international service if you have a GSM phone (CDMA won't work in Italy), but stay away from Cellular Abroad.

The B&B itself was very nice. Service was excellent and we felt like we had our very own maid. She was quick to help us, called taxis and insisted they be pronto, made arrangements, and made us feel at home. The room was elegant, the bathroom large, the air conditioning refreshing. The neighborhood was quiet and the views charming. We were very close to the best restaurant we had in Rome - try La Scala just down the hill! This is a very upper class neighborhood and you can walk to great shopping as well. Despite all this, the location was a hassle. We tried to use public transportation in Rome, and others had said this was convenient. However, the nearby Metro station was closed for repairs at the time of our visit, so check on this. Getting here from the Colosseum involved riding Metro B, transferring to Metro A, then riding it to Piazza de Popolo, then getting on the Urban Train which is covered in graffiti and very dirty. This dropped us off past the closed station, so we had to then ride a bus to the neighborhood, then walk up the hill. You can avoid this last bus if the station is reopened, but it will still be something of a hassle on public transportation. Anyone saying this is only 'one Metro stop' on the reviews is not telling the truth. I wished we had used a taxi more, but this will had at least 10 Euro each direction to your stay at the Suite. They may want to reduce the room charge by 20 E or provide a coupon while the Metro is closed. If you don't mind using a taxi and being out of the city center, this will be a wonderful retreat for you, as there is nothing to complain about with the suite itself or the service. I took some off on cleanliness as the fancy pillows had some stains. We used the free WiFi to video chat back to the family in the States.

Pre cruise we flew into Rome and travelled by train to Euclide, then walked to Suite Oriani. After this I would definitely recommend arranging a transfer from the airport As Suite Oriani seems to be on the highest point around and every direction of approach is uphill, when you are dragging a suitcase this is a major inconvenience. Also, we had booked many months in advance, with a view to the lovely garden rooms on the web site, but on arrival we found we had an upstairs room with a narrow spiral staircase to negotiate with the large cases already mentioned. The room however was superb, especially compared with the London hotel room we stayed in for the previous week. At night, sleeping with the french doors wide open we did not even notice any traffic noise. In the morning, the breakfast was adequate, not huge but I needed to diet anyway. After breakfast Alessandro rang for a taxi to take us to the Borghese Gallery. We booked out about lunch time for the trip to Civitavecchia to join the cruise. On our return from the cruise there was a bit of a mix up with rooms and we had one night in a very ordinary room before being moved to a better room for the remaining nights of our stay. The second room was almost as good as our room pre cruise and very comfortable. While Parioli may be considered a bit remote we found it an ideal compromise as the metro was close enough and very efficient. We soon found the quickest walking route to Euclide and local shops and without luggage the hills were not as daunting. On our last evening in Rome we used buses to travel to a restaurant for our final dinner in Rome, returning about midnight. The next morning was an early rise and transfer to the airport to fly home to Australia. There was a bit of a mix up with the time the transfer was required but we used the transfer organised by Aleesandro and once we were picked up the trip to the airport was very comfortable and quick.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Mesa, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice neighborhood; no contact with fellow tourists\u201d", "Author": "drjj", "ReviewID": "UR22047969", "Content": "My wife and I enjoyed staying in the Parioli, one of the nicer \"residential\" neighborhoods of Rome. We had been to Rome a couple of times, but chose this location precisely because it was out of the center. The neighborhood has many very large, well kept houses from the 18th century, some still private homes, some now flats, some embassies etc. It's a nice walk down to the street with many restaurants (we liked L'Escala best by far). It's also a very pleasant walk (we thought) from the Suites through the Villa Borghese Parco and on down the Spanish Steps for wander around the historic center of Rome. Our Rome was large as was the modern bath. It had a couple of chairs at the breakfast table, but lacked an upholstered chair for reading etc. in the evening after a return from dining etc. It's a great alternative to the very high priced hotels of central Rome in many ways, but in one regard it is very lacking for travelers lilke us and that is the following: Breakfasts are only served in the room (by the every attentive and helpful Victoria). This has certain advantages, but also prohibits any friendly conversation with fellow touristssuch as one often finds in a nice B&B property . There is no common area to gather on the property. The garden was mentioned online to some degree when I checked out the property, but it is held privately by the on-property owners (the son is the manager and will help out in any way possible, if asked, but mainly we (and our friends, another couple) had contact primarily with Victoria.

We did not take Allesandro up on his offer of a transfer from the airport and found the train trip from Fiumicino to be quick, comfortable and easy. However we were cheated by the taxi diver from the Termini - fellow travellers beware - make sure they turn the meter on - a typical ploy is to neglect that little detail and charge what they like. (A typical fare from the termini to Suite Oriani should not be more than 12-15 Euro - we got gouged for 35!) However, none of that was Suite Oriani's fault and armed with Allessandro's cautions on the subject, we were not overcharged again on two subsequent taxi trips to the hotel at the end of busy days. The hotel is truly a peaceful haven in a lovely neighbourhood. My husband, an architect, went mad for the fabulous art deco and art nouveau buildings on the surrounding streets (of which Suite Oriani is a stunning example of the latter). I think we may have had one on the smallest rooms in the house, (on the ground floor) but it was not cramped in the least. It was so quiet that we thought we were the only guests in the place until we found others on the morning we were checking out. The showerroom was the one that a previous reviewer has included a picture of and has complained about. Yes, it was a bit cramped but it was beautifully finished in classic Italian style. The water temperature and pressure was never a problem during our stay and I used the shower very early. Being a British/Canadian couple, we might have left out the bidet if we had been designing that showerroom to give a bit more room but of course understand that bidets are highly regarded in Italy. I am not complaining about it. The bed was firm and comfortable and the window stayed open throughout our stay - we enjoyed hot and sunny days and pleasantly cool nights. So we did not try the aircon but it looked up-to-date and in good condition. Breakfast - previous reviewers have commented on lukewarm Capucino and I would tend to agree but would add that as we usually had further capucinos while out and about, we ALWAYS found them to be lukewarm in cafes as well so won't hold this against Suite Oriani. Allessandro was at pains to explain that the breakfast was typically Italian and we found it to be so in later hotels we stayed at. When in Rome, etc. If you want a full English breakfast, come to England. We would definitely go back there and unreservedly recommend it to fellow travellers. Only thing is I wished we had made sure we got a room with a balcony - the other room on the ground floor has one and further ones upstairs do as well. On my next visit I will definitely stipulate that. We had two dinners in local restaurants, La Scala and Pariolini Pizzeria - both were great and get our recommendation. No tourist menus here. We felt very safe walking around this lovely neighbourhood and found the public transportation to the sites of Rome to be perfectly straighforward and compared to what we pay here in London a fantastic bargain at 1 Euro per trip.", "Date": "September 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cOut of this World!

Being first time travelers to Europe, it was our first trip to Rome and it was the trip that included the wedding of our first and eldest son. When traveling in the United States, we have always stayed at bed and breakfast inns. So we did not want to say at a hotel in central Rome. Booking our accommodations without the aid of a travel agent, we were impressed with the information regarding Suite Oriani on one of the many travel websites. Upon booking our reservations, four months in advance, with the travel website, we were contacted via email by Allessandro, the owner of Suite Oriani, the following day. Being first time travelers to Rome, we had numerous questions concerning our trip. Allessandro answered our many calls, and emails promptly and also offered advice. This advice included arranging transport from the FCO airport to Suite Oriani. Arriving in Rome, we met with difficulty concerning delays in our airline and the lost of our luggage. Being unable to use our cell phone in the FCO airport made it impossible to contact Alessandro concerning our situation. After searching and waiting one hour for our luggage, we departed the luggage area without our luggage and expecting our limo to have left without us. To our surprise, our driver was patiently waiting for us holding a sign bearing our name. Seeing him was the highlight of our arrival in Rome after the dismay caused by our airline(name not to be mentioned). Our driver listened patiently to our tale of woe as he directed us to our limo. After a pleasant drive through Rome, we arrived at Suite Oriani. Our driver escorted us to our room where we were met by Allessandro. Besides being polite and cordial, Allessandro told us general information in regard to the residental area where we were staying, as well as, directions(and a map) to help navigate Rome. He was very concerned about our experience at the airport and offered to help the following day with locating our luggage, without our asking for his assistance. Our room was everything we imagined and more! It was spacious, tidy, airy, and comfortable. The bath was larger than we expected given the information regarding European baths on the web. As to the hot water mentioned in other reviews, we never experienced any problem with the water at any time of the day during our stay. With Allessandro's recommendation, we dined our first evening at La Scala, a local restaurant, within walking distance of Suite Oriani. It was one of the best meals we had while in Rome! The waiter was very courteous and helpful in making our first dining experience in Rome wonderful! We awoke our first morning in Rome after a comfortable night's rest to fresh scents of lemon trees, of magnolia blossoms, and of floral scents drifting through the balcony doors. Having a good night's sleep with the balcony doors ajar (as air conditioning can be optional in Rome due to its climate, but there if needed), we awoke refreshed. Shortly, a knock at our door, Allessandro's assistant arrived with a tray of hot cappuccinos, croissants, fresh butter, toast, nutella, fresh juice, yogart, and Italian cookies. This would be our daily experience each and every morning at Suite Oriani. Such wonderful memories! Each day, we walked a short distance to the subway that we would take to downtown Rome to tour the sights. The website is correct in stating that the subway is accessible by walking a short distance. All the websites state that walking to see the sights is the preferred way. This is one of the reasons we enjoyed staying at Suite Oriani, we could easily walk to the subway-travel closer to Rome, see the sights, return by subway, and enjoy a pleasant \"fragrance filled\" walk back to Suite Oriani. Each evening we returned to a room that was tidy and clean and relax in a quiet and tranquil atmosphere. Then, if we chose, walk through the neighborhood that is very safe to nearby restaurants. Also, to our surprise and relief, each evening we were met by Allessandro who would update us on his communication with our airline and the status of our lost luggage- we also had been in touch with the airline during the day. It really was a nice experience for us that Allessandro assisted with our situation without our asking. He really went beyond our expectations of an innkeeper! Sadly, the day of our departure arrived, still without our luggage,we would have to leave Rome for the Amalifi coast and the weddding of our son. Our train departed at 12:45 PM. At this point , Allessandro and his assistant were invaluable as it was their phonecalls and insistance, with the airlines, not ours due to the lanugage barrier, that our luggage was delivered at 12:15 PM to the gates of Suite Oriani. Simultaneously, Allessandro was on his phone communicating with our transportation and we were off to board our train for Naples. If you have the good fortune of traveling to Rome, you will enjoy staying at Suite Oriani!! It meets and exceeds the information offered by their website. We hope to return to Rome in our future and when we do, we will return to Suite Oriani!!

We were bewildered as our stay went on, by the comments made by other guests. For instance, the breakfasts - they are horrible, to say the least! Coffee at room temperature, melba toast, fruit punch from a powder mix and day old sticky croissants. It's substandard , no fruit, nothing at all special. This starchy breakfast only leaves you with a bottomed out feeling later in the morning. We received one pat of butter our first morning (there were three of us) and no butter the remaining three mornings. The owners eat well, as we smelled their breakfasts cooking each morning!! Our triple room was a queen size bed (foam mattress, lumpy pillows) and a roll away bed, not big enough for a child over the age of 12. Our son is an adult and the owner, Alessandro, was made aware of this when we booked. Not only that, the shower was so small, you couldn't properly wash, and we are slim people. The water pressure was nonexistant. The shower drain was VERY slow and worst yet, NO HOT WATER BEFORE 7:30AM!!!! Tough luck to anyone wanting to get ready early and head into Rome to tour, which, let's face it, is everyone who stays here as a guest. For insatnce, a lot of organised tours begin at 9am. Also, leaving the windows open at night was out of the question, since the neighbors and who ever lives down below the room we were in played loud music each night until 2am and the cooking odors drifted in at all hours of the night, as well. We read the previous review about being moved to another hotel and worried that would happen to us, but, luckily it didn't. We were in regular contact with Alessandro prior to the trip, yet he did not make himself known at all throughout our four night stay! Renalto, the housekeeper, said we would be lucky to see him at all. Renalto does her best, but seems she does everything including taking the payment at the end of our stay. She is a bit stressed at times. She got a little testy at the start of our stay, but seemed okay after that. The hotel is easy to get to (two trains) after you figure out the confusing map. The neighborhood is a bit iffy, as far as litter and grafitti and sits outside the Embassy area. The next time we go to Rome, we will not be staying at Suite Oriani. The website is impressive, but like the previous review, beware! La Scala was nice, we ate there our first night, but be careful with the restaurants/cafe's in Rome, as the take out charge for food and the sit in charge is completely different!! We were charged 39 Euro for three sandwiches, and three coffees at a cafe near the Vatican. They charged us double to bring it to our table!!! We were shocked, but who can you complain to when most don't speak English and we don't speak or read Italian. The price lists are not generally displayed, so ask the price before ordering anything. The venders charge 4 Euros for a bottle of soda.

Also buildings with drives, the cars are allowed to park blocking pavement. You don't want to spend too much time in the road though, as the drivers get target fixation. In need of some good food on arrival at Oriani, we were pointed in the direction of La Scalla Ristorante (we were not aware of the class differences in Italian restaurants), we didn\u2019t get good Italian food, nor did we get good service, bordering on racial discrimination. La Pariolina Pizzeria was the complete opposite, FANTASTIC, good variety of great well cooked meals, deserts that we still dream about & excellent friendly service, very warm busy atmosphere.
