The hotel also has a great location on Lido, near the shops and restaurants on one of the main streets on Lido, and also near a 10 minute walk to the beach on the other side of Lido (which was good for a stroll, if not for a swim, during our stay). The room's themselves were very clean, simple, and comfortable. The beds were large (180cm?), and firm, with memory foam mattresses. When we first arrived, Venice was very cold, around -4 or-5 C,and our room was also very cold. But everything warmed up over the course of our 6 night stay. There is a very pleasant breakfast room where one can revive themselves. The hotel is generous with their continental breakfast, and we had to remember to save our appetite for Venice!

This hotel offered free car parking. Having travelled around most of Italy over many years staying in budget and not so budget hotels, I have learned not to expect too much of Italian accommodation. However, I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived at Hotel Villa Cipro. The hotel was located in a lovely quiet location near the main street of Lido. The reception staff were very helpful and I found the rooms lovely, clean, with great beds and all the required amenities. The breakfast was also very good with a range of food to choose from at the buffet - the breakfast ladies provided excellent service. In comparison to many other breakfasts I have had in Italy, I thought this one was very good. The hotel has a lovely personality and I was surprised that it had so few stars. We chose this location and knew it would require travelling on the vaporetto to the centre of Venice, however, it was easy and no further than it would take to travel from the mainland to some other areas in Venice. I have stayed in Canneregio before but I felt this was a better location especially to visit places like, Murano, Burano and Torcello. I loved coming back to Lido at the end of a long day in the centre of Venice as it was so much less busy and more peaceful. I have been to Venice four times and have stayed in a variety of areas and I would highly recommend staying in Lido and especially at this hotel. As to comments in the other reviews in regards to the English level of the reception staff, I felt all the staff at the hotel spoke good English. After all we were in Italy and the fact that the Italians made an effort to speak our native language \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we should be very grateful, maybe we mono-lingual people need to make more of an effort to learn the languages of the countries we are visiting.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Albans", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but hotel could make a few improvements\u201d", "Author": "smileycub", "ReviewID": "UR115518896", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel with two friends for 3 nights in June. The location of the hotel is fantastic; a quiet area within easy access of the vaporetto and Lido. The staff were cordial but not over-friendly. Rooms were clean, but a little small and apart from a massively oversized light fitting, sparsely decorated. The aircon. was not particularly efficient; you need to leave it on all day whilst you are out to make it reasonably cool for when you return. Bathroom was small but functional, but the towels are made of curious thin material so take your own if you prefer the luxurious fluffy variety. Take a beach towel also or be prepared to buy one locally. Breakfast was quite basic, with low quality pastries and unappetising ham, cheese and fruit; not a great advert for Italian cuisine. However, on the bright side you can boil your own egg which is a change from the pre-cooked rock hard ones you often find in hotels. If you would like something yummy for breakfast there are various places nearby selling great coffee and fresh, delicious pastries. There are plenty of shops and restaurants just a stone's throw away, but we spent most of our time either in the heart of Venice or on Murano where we found great places to eat with the help of the Lonely Planet Guide Book. We did eat on the Lido on our final night and had an excellent meal with great service and a fabulous sunset view at The Viktoria Palace Hotel which is just by the Vaporetto stop 5 minuites walk from the hotel.

Our hotel was Hotel Villa Cipro in Lido. We had a bad experience and we want to share it with others and warn future travellers to Venice hotels. Our room air condition never worked despite the hotel reception informing us that it does. On our second night, we tried to use the air condition as it was quite hot and we informed the hotel reception the next morning. The hotel reception tried to convince us that the air condition was working fine, that the sign \"snowflake\" does not mean cool air, but it indicates that it's winter weather outside and \"sunshine\" sign means it's summer weather outside. So to get cool air, one must put it on the \"sunshine\" sign. This was of course ridiculous as we had travelled to so many countries and stayed at so many hotels and only this one gives the opposite meaning of the air condition. We left a message with the hotel reception for the owner to call us back, but the owner never did, and I had to call them up to find out if they will refund us for the second night or give us a discount to compensate us for our horrible hot room the second evening. The owner, not only didn't apologize (only much later on when I brought it up) but tried to convince us that we should have reported the problem right away even in the middle of the night. And since we only told them the problem the next morning upon checking out, there is nothing they could do. But she did tell me that the air condition in the room was broken on the second evening onwards and there was no engineer to fix it. Her only lame offer was to give us a Euro20 discount on the room. We paid Euro155 for each night and this measly discount was nothing. So to all the future travellers going to Venice or perhaps Italy, please remember that if you want your money back, you can forget about it, and if you want to change your room, you better do it the same moment you have a problem.

Only issue we had was that as it was also end of holiday season a lot of accommodation and restaurants are closed for winter. Arrived at Venice station from Florence and caught water ferry to Lido Island. Ferry wharf right o/s rail station. Walked 800 metres straight down towards the beach and there is Villa Cipro. Location : Great location as away from main area of activity of bars and restaurants and in summer beach crowds but still only 5 minutes from them all. Located amongst private residences off main street.. Check In : Very good. English speaking lady who was extremely pleasant and helpful. Night staff at desk were also helpful. So for a total of 7 samll hotels in various size towns we had met with reception staff who spoke english. This was extremely good considering what we had read and been told prior to going there. Room : Great but typical european small. 2 Balconies and suspect during the summer holidays extremely nice to sit out there with a vino and watch the world go by. It was clean, well maintained, comfortable. The only issue w ehad and it appears it was due to the cold weather and all the windows staying shut was there was a smell towards the end of our stay from the bathroom(suspect toilet system) The old house was owned by a family and had been renovated into a comfortable 3 star hotel. Breakfast : Continental b/fast included. Lady(Anna) who looked after things at ground level was great and extremely helpful even with the language barrier. Transport : Water ferries available regularly. Hint : if arriving to stay for 3 days get a $E25.00 ferry pass as once validated it is valid for 72 hours from time of validation and we used ours constantly and to everywhere. Day passes are expensive I can assure you of that The 3 day pass is available at the railway station on arrival.

This certainly made the room feel bigger (and we saw that there are even bigger rooms available when peaking in from the hallway during the cleaning, but we were just fine with the size of ours). The breakfast is basic but enough to go on. There are enough choices of water-buses leaving from the ferry docks to get to San Marco, etc. The 10min journey is easy, and allows you to spend time in Venice and then return 'home' for dinner at one of the good restaurant choices on the main street (especially the one directly opposite the hotel that has an outdoor terrace - much better than any we went to in Venice, which were too expensive and touristy). I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind a sense of adventure and easy-living on their trips.", "Date": "November 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Augusta, GA", "Title": "\u201cI LOVE THIS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1762048", "Content": "This was the best hotel ever.
