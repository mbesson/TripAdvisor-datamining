In a long but leisurely day's walk we did the loop to Spanish Steps, St Peter's, Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and back....and of course the metro less than a block away got us everywhere else.

The breakfast was not really good. Only sweet breads and cereal were offered. I was disappointed that there was no fruit or yogurt. However we did get to start our day with a cappuccino. The people at the front were nice enough to allow us to use the computer downstairs. The only terrible part was that there were protests outside our window (near a government building) which was terribly annoying. For 10 hours we heard nothing but loud drums and yelling.

We payed much more than we usually do but got less service than anywhere else we have stayed. Firstly we arrived at 1.40pm unaware that checkin wasn't until 2 after checking our emails etc for 15 mins or so we asked how long until it would be ready and were told 30 mins. Not a problem we would go out for a walk and come back then. When we arrived back around 3pm the room still wasn't ready and we waited in a little room at the back of the hotel, with one sofa already occupied by another couple. When we finally got into our room I went to have a shower and their were pubic hairs all over the shower and sink. Why did they make us wait if they weren't cleaning it properly? The whole room was pretty tired and run down with mold in the shower, broken light switches and an ugly noisy aircon system. All of which would have been ok if we had been paying budget prices \u00a350/night but at a \u00a3130 we felt ripped off. We had got a superior room expecting a treat! I dread to think what the standard rooms were like. Breakfast was upstairs on a terrace which was one of the features that sold me the hotel, unfortunatly there are only 3 tables on it and we struggled to get one. The breakfast was again disappointing, but the croissants were quite tasty. I know you don't get much with a european breakfast but the quality of what we had was low.

I foolishly thought maybe that was just a problem during the summer or in certain rooms. I thought, \"How bad could it be?\" But it was a problem in March.

I raised this to the attention of the front desk staff and they dismissed it, saying there has never been a sewage problem with the room before and they cannot do anything because it is a problem with Rome's sewage system. This is a load of crap (no pun intended) because it is obvious from the reviews I have read that countless people had the same problem with Room 203 - it reeks of sewage! I requested to be moved to another room, but the hotel staff could not offer me another one because the hotel was fully booked. Front desk staff Nima (speaks English well) and Hugo (cannot speak English) have zero problem solving skills. They did not know how to handle the situation and there was no Manager on duty. They spoke in Italian to themselves, smirking and joking which was incredibly rude. When I pointed this out, they said they were trying to lighten the stress - What a lie! When the Manager Mr. Bottari finally contacted me in the late evening via telephone, he was rude and started yelling at me trying to blame me for making a complaint!! I was so shocked at his lack of decency and lack of customer service skills. This man is crazy and should not be managing any hotel.

Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.", "Date": "January 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ithaca, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice stay at Cinquantatre\u201d", "Author": "OttoCal", "ReviewID": "UR6509233", "Content": "Had a great trip to Rome and had no compliants at L'Hotel Cinquantatre. Hard to find listings of reviews, as sometimes you find it alphabatized under L, H, or C, and the website was very tricky to track down, but very nice once I found it. (try using the number 53 instead of spelling it out...) We arrived at about 9:00 a.m. and weren't able to check in that early, but they stored our bags and sent us out with a map to explore. When we checked in, I almost had a heart attack when I saw the room- it was tinier than I had expected, and I have seen small rooms before. But then I realized that we actually had a second small room with a day bed, huge wardrobe, fridge, nice chair, and a nice sized balcony- yay! We were in a room at the back, overlooking a small courtyard. The rooms in the front have a street view (quiet street) and very tiny balconies- just enough room to stand on, no table/chairs. The bathroom had a nice heated towel rack. We got fresh towels 2 times in 6 days, which I think is pretty standard there. The breakfast was included, and it was a pretty good spread- cereal, milk, cornettos, rolls, crackers, spreads, coffee, juice etc. This is from 7-9 every day, and after breakfast the server cleans the rooms. It is a small hotel, mabe 14 rooms or so, with a small and friendly staff. Some of the staff at the desk spoke much better English than others, and were able to help with reservations, directions, calling around to places etc. The others weren't as much help- but it was easy to figure out and just take advantage of the 2 who spoke the best English. I think they were brothers. This hotel is very close to the metro station Barberini. I would suggest at taxi to get to/from Termini, the metro can be tricky wtih luggage, especially if you get stuck during a rush hour. There is a church 1 block away that has fascinating Capuchin Crypts, a great 30 minute stop, especially for teens. There is an Enoteca right across from that church on another side street so you can get a bottle of wine to enjoy on your balcony- there are corkpulls in the rooms and plastic cups in the bath. The fixtures are modern, but there was a small bit of mold in the high up corners in our shower- way too high for the maid to reach. We also noticed some in the room with the internet. The internet is supposed to be 2 Euro for the first 1/2 hour and 1 Euro for each 15 minutes after that, and due to some strange Italian rules they have to copy your passport to let you use it. They didn't end up charging us- probably b/c they didn't want to deal with the additional paperwork on check-out and our stay was pre-paid on Expedia. There is also a large Internet Cafe on the Piazza. They had great suggestions on things to do and see. The Villa Borghese park was a close walk, as well as the Trevi Fountain & Spanish Steps. The American Embassy was also close by, and Hard Rock, which we went to for a couple of drinks when we were feeling cheesy one night. Met some fabulous servicemen from UK and USA there, so it was fun. We liked the restaurants much better in other areas in town, be sure to check your guide books and go to the recommended ones. There are bad restaurants out there trying to hook tourists. There was so much within walking distance, and having the metro right there was great. That line did shut down pretty early in the evening though, probably between 9-10, which was hard to figure out. It is only 2 stops from the Termini Station, so a reasonable walk. The lobby and elevator were quite small, 1 person + luggage, or 2 people, no luggage for the elevator, and probably not more than 3-4 people could fit into the lobby. The hotel is tricky to find, yyou have to look for the glass door with the name & building number. We just looked for the 'BAR' sign, as there was a bar right next door. We thought the hotel was charming, and were really happy with the proximity to the metro stop. We used the metro every day, even for just a stop or 2, since we had the week-long metro cards. Watch out for beggars/children on the metro, if you don't let them catch your eye you should be fine. Mostly we just saw commuters though, not as many tourists, but we were there in the off-season (November). We packed, and used, umbrellas for one day during our trip, but it was sunny and pleasant the rest of the time.", "Date": "December 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leamington Spa, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5409130", "Content": "good location, literally 10 mins walk to the Trevi Fountain. If you don't mind walking and taking in alot of the sights then you can probably walk everywhere! The hotels has a tiny reception and the rooms are quite small, however we were on Floor two and as there are only about 3-4 rooms per floor (total of 5 floors) there really is no noise. The rooms are very clean and so are the bathrooms. Breakfast is contintental but there are alot of coffee houses and small restaurants near the Hotel if you want something extra. The staff are friendly and make sure you grab a map from the reception, we ended up using this more than our pricey travel guide! A cab from the hotel to the Termini main train station is about 8 euros and there is a direct train from Termini to Fumicino airport every 1/2 hour which costs another 8euros.

Quite honestly, it was not our first choice but the hotel our friends had highly recommended (Daphne B&B) was booked. Actually, the Daphne staff directed us to the Hotel 53. Having been in Rome earlier at a further away and inconvenient location, I did not want to make the same mistake twice. The location was awesome. The hotel is rather simple and actually does not look like much from the outside. The hotel used to be owned by some sort of religious order but was sold or rented 3 years ago to the owners of the hotel. They have basically have been refurbishing the hotel within the last three years. Our room was not too big but it was clean and had a nice decor with antiques. In terms of amenities, our room came equipped with a minifridge, TV and our own bathroom which had recently been renewed . The hotel has a tiny elevator which is rather funny to see . Our above average rating stems from 3 main reasons: 1)friendliness and helpfulness from staff especially Nima and Hugo. H/ever, the other desk people were very helpful as well wether it was helping us find/printing maps for places or even helping us reconfirm our train reservations. Their friendly tone was set from the moment we were calling to make reservations. 2) We loved the convenience of the location (intersection of piazza barberini and via condotti) because the hotel is like a 1-2 minute walk to the Barberini metro station. Walking to the Trevi fountain like in less than 10 minutes, an extra 5-8 minutes to the Panteon. We were even able to walk easily to Piazza Navona and to Campo di Fiori. Having easy access to the main subway line and being at close walking distance from many attractions was a huge time saver!! Plus, the easy access for shopping by Via del Corso was great 3)The hotel doens't have a lobby per say but it has a back room in which you can check internet at any time for free (sooo convenient!) Our rate was 160 euros which seemed reasonable to us. The hotel does not have a restaurant but there are many in the nearby streets that we didn't miss it. The breakfast area pretty much looks like in the pictures (from the hotel website and Venere). There are 3 tables in the terrace but the indoor tables are in a nice setting. We loved having breakfast in the terrace which offered a really nice view to day to start your day. The woman in charge of the breakfast is very nice and accomodating. In spite of saying she didn't speak English, she knows enough to get by. Breakfast is the standard fare of breads/croissants, cereals, etc. and you can have as much as you want. Also, I want to point out that we didn't experience any of the \"odors\" or noise issues that other reviews have cited. Overall, the staff and location made it a very pleasant experience for us.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ithaca", "Title": "\u201cokay for 100 Euro/ night\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4161021", "Content": "The hotel is very cute.

The Cinquantatre is a typically Italian hotel; it's small but perfectly formed! My friend and I had room 102, it's a lovely room, at the front, with beautiful antique furniture and twin beds. The bathroom is modern with shower etc. The breakfast terrace is fantastic and the breakfast good with as many croisants and rolls as you can eat, as much coffee and juice as you want, also yougurt, cerial etc. If the weather is bad you can breakfast in the very pretty and roomy dinning room. The staff are extremely helpful, and the hotel is very clean; clean sheets and towels every day. Aslo, unusually for Italy the towels are fluffy!!!! The location of the hotel is perfect, just 1 minute up the street from the Piazza Barberini and the metro; very near the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. Round the corner is the Palazzo Barberini a beautiful building designed by Bernini which houses a very fine art gallery. Although the hotel is in a central location, it is very quiet with no noise at all at night to keep anybody awake. We both slept very well, as the beds and pillows are extremely comfy.

The location of the hotel is excellent. It is 100m\u2019s from the Piazza Barberini, a 2 min walk from the Trevi fountain and 5 mins from the Spanish Steps. The Barberni metro station is close by, which makes getting round the city very easy. The hotel itself is okay \u2013 simple & basic. We stayed in room 102 which had no key for the safe and the room key went missing halfway through our stay. Though after our initial panic neither marred our stay at all. The bed was huge and most important of all, the aircon worked perfectly. However, there was a bit of a smell coming from the bathroom, which we think was coming from the shower. Breakfast is served on the roof terrace which affords lovely views of the buildings opposite. Be aware though that there are only three tables on the terrace so you may have to sit in the rather cramped dining room. The breakfast itself is a typical continental affair \u2013 croissants and coffee, cereals and a small selection of fruit. The young girl that looks after the breakfast service is very helpful.
