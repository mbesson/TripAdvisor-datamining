We were meeting up with a Cosmo tour group for Spain , Portugal. and Morocco. Our first 4 nights were spent in a dreary room on the 1st floor overlooking another building. We were kept a wake several nights when a group of young people ran up and down the hallways and slammed doors until the wee hours. Many groups stay at this budget hotel. We had booked and paid for breakfast ahead of time and it was very good in the main dining room. Once we joined our tour groupo breakfast was now in a banquet rooms and was inferior to what we had experienced. Wifi is not free and you have to get a new code every 24hrs 4 euros what a pain! Front desk was less than helpful and when we inquired how to get to the Zoo we were told to take a taxi. When we returned from our tour we spent one more night here and it was on the 5th floor, the room was on the corner and sunlit. What a difference from that first room which was dark and dreary. The hotel is reasonably convenient and the 23 bus will take you to Plaza Mayor for 1.50 euro. The Metro is also walking distance and we had no trouble venturing to Toledo on the Metro and train. Museums and other main sights are accessible by metro and bus 20-30min. There are several restaurants in the area watch out for the bread and other offerings olaced on the table they are not free!

My colleagues who are Spanish locals said the weather was unusual for May but we loved it! We were thankful that this hotel had aircon! We arrived at the hotel at 1pm and they let us check in early with no troubles at all. One of my party had forgotten to print out her return journey boarding pass for our ryan air flight and the hotel staff kindly printed it for her..... but she had to pay the four euros for the 1hr internet access! They also gave me a free map which came in very handy and I used this to navigate where everything was with the help of my colleagues. We had 3 twin rooms which were clean, nice, offered towels, a wardrobe, and two of the rooms had balonies. Unfortunately our hair dryer didn't work but otherwise the room was great. The room had a safe and cost 2 EUR per day to use, we all just used one together in our group. The room are cleaned daily, on our second day the cleaner knocked on our door as asked to clean our room. Since we were staying 2 nights only we told her we didn't need it cleaned and she still gave us clean towels and offered to empty bins anyway! Very nice service! I'd read that the hotel offered great breakfast but we didn't wake early enough and opted out. Instead, we bought croissants and tea from the pastry shop several doors away from the hotel and ate in the room. The location of this hotel was fine, it wasn't near the centre but it had a bus stop right outside the entrance which takes you into the town, Puerta del Sol. The journey only takes 15 mins max. and is a mere 1.50 EUR. Nearby is the nearest metro station Marqu\u00e9s de Vadillo which is a 10-15 minute walk away. The metro system was very easy to navigate around and is similar to the london tube. I bought tickets from the ticket machine which offered instructions in english and I bought a ticket for 10 journeys for 12 EUR. This includes journeys made on the buses too. At today's exchange rate, it's very cheap! Taxis were available at 4:30am outside the hotel to take us to the airport which was handy, we were worried there would be none so early! It was only 30 EUR and the taxis were metered. We made trip one night from Puerta del Sol back to the hotel in a taxi and it was only 8 EUR. All in all, we had no complaints about this hotel at all.

When we stayed privately, I would rate the breakfast as fantastic. Heaps of fresh fruit and a huge variety of pastries, cereals and you name it, they had it. It was so disappointing to return the following morning, be redirected to the tour dining room, and see the tinned fruit, powdered milk and powdered juice. It was very sad! In regards to the stay, it was an interesting time. The doors are very thin, so you get woken up by people coming and going at all hours of the night and day.

There are instructions on another forum on trip advisor that gives intstructions on how to get to the motel using the metro (from the airport) - much cheaper than bus transfers or taxi!

The hotel is not conveniently located from the airport, and one needs to change metro 3 times in order to get there. Unless you plan to take a taxi to the airport, I would not recommend this location. Throughout our stay, we discovered that customer service was severely lacking at this hotel. We pre-paid for breakfast for example, but because we arrived a bit later then when the breakfast was served, the hotel refused to accomodate a meal. On our last night, we asked for a picnic breakfast to go since our plane was early in the morning and again were denied. Keep in mind, we pre-paid for breakfast for the duration of our stay. Although I could still understand them not accomodating our breakfast, the way that the did it was not acceptable. The front desk would refer us to the head waiter, who did not speak English, and who in turn would bring us back to the front desk. At that time, the front desk attendant would just tell us that, no, the meal will not be covered. Why send us all over the hotel? The worst hovewer happened on the day we were supposed to depart. The hotel forgot to give us a wake up call in the morning and we overslept, missing our plane to Barcelona as a result. When we woke up, 1.5 hours later then planned, my husband called downstairs and requested for hotel to pay for the taxi, since it was there fault. They said, OK, no problem, just come downstairs. When we ran downstairs and came to the front desk to get the taxi voucher, they pretended that they don't even know anything about our wake up call, or the call from the room only minutes before. In all my years of travel, I have never seen such customer service! Bottom line, the gate was closed when we got to the airport and we had to purchase new tickets. $325 that we never were able to recoup!

The service was better than expected, and they went out of their way to assist my wife and child while I was in my meetings. They have added wireless internet throughout the hotel for 6 Euros per day, and the conference facility was above average including a booth that could be used for simultaneous language translation. The Hotel Praga is located 25-30 minutes from the airport, and a taxi from the airport will cost approximately 30 Euros. It is approximately a 10 minute walk from the Metro, and all of the tourist sites can be reached within 20-25 minutes including the walk. There are quite a few restaurants and cafes within walking distance from the hotel. Americans who are not used to European hotels may want to look elsewhere, however. The rooms are fairly small, and they are not air-conditioned. Many of the staff speak limited English. The hotel is located in a more commercial part of Madrid, and it can be noisy at night especially when the windows are kept open due to the lack of air conditioning. The rooms lack many of the luxuries found in many hotels including alarm clocks, hair dryers, coffee pots, and a fitness center.

If you're not travelling with a ton of bags, save $35-40 Euro by taking the train. Take the shuttle bus to terminal 2, where you can get the 8 Line, transfer at Colombia to the 9 and at Nunez Balboa to the 5. Get off at Marques de Vadilla stop. Antonio Lopez is right off to the side when you come out of the station and its about 10 mins walk to the hotel. As for places to go, Plaza Mayor, Plaza Sol, Museo Prado, Real, Retiro Park are all easily accessible by transport. Prado is free on Sundays and Retiro is great for spending a day just sitting around. There is also a alot of shopping along Gran Via and Sol. Ham is their specialty and tapas bars are plentiful. Also try the churros with hot chocolate. We also ran into a red light area but can't remember where that was. I found people in Spain to be very nice and helpful. My small grasp of Spanish went along. Some speak English also, just dont expect everyone to be bilingual.", "Date": "November 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nuremberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cMadrid is great, but this hotel [----]!\u201d", "Author": "Ulrike48&daughter", "ReviewID": "UR6053518", "Content": "What can I say.

The staff were not rude, as we had expected, they were actually quite pleasant and spoke good english. We took our own bags up to our room and were very happy when we discovered the bathroom - smart marble floors and walls, a bath, shower, bidet, toilet, and nice big sink. The bedroom, however, was rather dull. The decor was very boring, basic, and didn't feel very homely. The view out the window was not great. We had a clear view of the block of flats and the wall opposite. This was out the back of the hotel. There were no net curtains so we were in full view of all the people living in the flats opposite. The beds were, as per most double hotel rooms in the continent, two single beds side by side. this is ok sometimes but one of them was wobbly and a bit squeeky and we ended up trying to share one - a bit squished! One big bonus, however, was the very effective full length blackout curtains. I liked these very much. i also think they helped block out a bit of the noise from the motorway still under construction as they were so heavy. Also, for a quiet night in if that is your sort of thing there was sky news, cnn and BBC world for free on the tv and several pay per view movie channels in english. You could get access to all the 'in-room cinema' channels for about 12 euros for up to 24 hours. Breakfast was not included in the price of the expedia booking. this was a big pity. The hotel charge an extortionate 10 euros per person per morning for a breakfast that was not that exciting. They had a rather poor soggy selection of 'full english breakfast' items (bacon, scrambled eggs, mushrooms) then a selection of cooked meats, cheese, bread, mini pastries (always a winner!), some rather tasty cooked tomato sauce (odd for breakast, huh!), and a small selection of cereals and tortilla. Plenty of coffee and steamed milk was laid on each table. But unfortunately no tea. My boyfriend was most disappointed that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom. the hotel restaurant appeared to be somewhat expensive and so we didn't try it. Nearby there were a couple of nice little cafes/pastry shops so we were able to get tasty breakfast much cheaper out of the hotel. The location of the hotel was a bit annoying - 10 minutes walk (turn right out of the hotel and it's a straight line until the roundabout) - to the nearest tube (marques de vadilla) - but didn't greatly interfere with our activities. There was a great bar down the road a few minutes towards the tube, on the opposite side of the road, though i can't unfortunately recall it's name for you.

We asked for a quiet room on a high floor and we were given exactly what we wanted. You would have thought we were in the hotel on our own ! - it was a great room allocation. Rooms at the front of the hotel were probably more noisy but our room was extremly quiet. The room was of adequate size, well appointed, with a comfortable bed, chairs and table, plenty of storage space and a super bathroom. The size of room wasn't important to us as after a long day walking round Madrid, a nice shower and a comfortable bed were the most important factors ! We didn't eat in the hotel. We bought rolls, ham and other things and had a lovely DIY breakfast in our room before leaving for the day's expedition. We took a kettle and coffee as there wasn't coffee facilities in the room. We can recommend \"Museo del Jamon\" for super rolls and ham and pastries. There are bars and restaurants in the area around the hotel, but we ate in the city before returning to the hotel. We found some really nice places to eat tapas and meals around the Plaza Major area. For us, the best thing about the Hotel Praga is the location. It isn't in the city centre; it's about 8kms from the city. We like to stay out of the centre and travel in each day. Couldn't be easier from this hotel ! Bus stop outside the hotel ... 20 mins later .. you are virtually in the Plaza Major - only a few minutes walk ! Very reliable, very frequent and cheap !
