On our return we were checked in quickly and shown to our budget room. Our first thought was how small the room was, barely enough room at the bottom of the bed to walk around. Stangely the bathroom was a good size in comparison. The bedroom had very little wardrobe space or anywhere to store suitcases. There was no view out of the window, just overlooked a quadrangle area overlooked by other bedrooms on all sides so you had to keep the blinds shut for privacy. and you could not even see the sky. On the plus side the rooms were modern and had everything you need, i.e. iron and ironing board, fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, good tv. And the bathroom has plenty of toiletries but no shelves. The walls are wafer thin so careful what you are up to. Nice little lounge area and bar. Handy for the trains and a 15/20 minute walk to Circular Quay straight down Pitt St. Paddys Market and China town a 5minute walk away. We stayed for 3 nights which is about as long as you would want in that size room.

I wanted to impress her but the budget was limited so after careful consideration of several hotels, I chose Metro thinking it average-to-good, but fairly priced and a bit wary after reading a few very negative reviews. I was VERY surprised when I found out the spacious room, super-comfortable beds, pleasant decor and top-notch cleaniness. Moreover, I managed to catch a free WIFI offer and I couldn't believe how reliable and fast it was (not to mention unlimited,) I don't even get such a good Internet at home paying premium for it! As others have said, it's also conveniently located in the middle of the CBD with the Opera House on walking distance. The only complaint was a rather ugly but not too big faded stain in the carpet which I guess is what people who post negative reviews get hung on?If you are paying over $300 in a 5-star hotel that might be a valid concern, but when you are getting such a great value for your buck (4-star quality for under $120 a night!) you shouldn't mind secondary details like that. Old lifts were ugly and slow but I got there right when they were replacing them, now they are state-of-the-art which shows that even being on top of their game they strive to improve even further. I just hope that won't affect their prices because I'm planning to keep lodging there for all my future travels to Sydney!", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay again\u201d", "Author": "Royalequus", "ReviewID": "UR127941508", "Content": "Really disappointed with this hotel.

The room was very clean and small (but size of room is understandable given price and location). It is a fair price for such a convenient downtown location in Sidney's CBD (approximately 2-3 blocks from subway stations). It was decently quiet for such a central location (asked for a room facing away from the main street). Front desk customer service was also very good and helpful. Didn't plan on eating at hotel restaurant, but happened to eat a breakfast sandwich one morning and was happily surprised. The restaurant price seemed high at first, but portions were generous and it tasted delicious. Some interesting things about Sidney: shopping/eating hours in the CBD are terrible (e.g. most places in CBD close down at 5pm or soon thereafter); buying the weekly MyMulti + Airport Link is well worth the money if planning to stay more than 4-5 days and taking public transit to beaches (e.g. Bondi and Manly), Fish Market, etc.)...", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay at the Metro on Pitt!\u201d", "Author": "Archie Y", "ReviewID": "UR127102233", "Content": "Think twice about booking at the Metro on Pitt. We booked the top room (King Spa) for an anniversary getaway. On the first night we had a spa. Afterwards we let the plug out and went into the bedroom to find all the water had somehow drained through the side wall and the carpet in the bedroom was under water. Promptly called the manager, who offered us another room. We spent 15 minutes packing all our belongings up, trekked down to reception, and received a new room key without a single apology or ANY offer of compensation whatsoever. Usually I wouldn't say anything but I asked what kind of compensation we could be given. I was told the only thing he could offer us were 2 for 1 drink vouchers next door... Wow a free drink if we still BUY one ourselves... we felt like management really cared. So we lugged our things up to the 7th floor (our room had been on the first floor) and got into our new room to find it had 2 single beds in it... clearly NOT the same room we booked. Back down to reception, no apology, new room key, back up to level 7 and finally another identical room. All this at 10:30pm on a Friday night, a perfect way to spend a relaxing anniversary night after a nice dinner and spa, thanks Metro!

Absolutely not worth anything like that sort of money! My room was on the second floor, overlooking Pitt Street - I was repeatedly disturbed by traffic noise and the monorail going past. The room was basically adequate and clean (an improvement on a previous stay at this place). Shower screen door didn't close properly so water went all over the floor each time I showered. The mattress had springs sticking up in odd places and was seriously uncomfortable - I didn't sleep well for the whole three nights. Internet via their broadband connection costs an additional $15, but I could not make a connection, even after trying for a couple of hours; possibly, this is a perennial problem with this establishment as they have a section in the room guide specifically devoted to \"troubleshooting\" your computer to deal with connection problems. When I asked for help with this, the staff simply said \"sorry, it should be showing up\". Service - on check-in it was good, and the housekeeping staff must be good as my room was kept clean [that's a huge improvement on a previous occasion]. Check-out was a nightmare that I struggled through. The check-out staff member that I got just wasn't with it at all! He took my credit card, then didn't give me either the receipt or the card back: just the invoice. When I handed over the room key, I gave him two luggage chits for cases that I had previously placed in their luggage storage facility. I had to repeat my request to get my cases and the fellow then started filling out a chit to put my other case into storage. I repeated that I wanted to get bags out from the storage, not put them in. Then he started asking for my luggage chits (which I suspect he may have thrown into the bin with the doorkey folder) and looked totally blank when I said I'd just given them to him.

I would stay here again on a deal price purely because of location and the room was sufficient if a little run down, but I would definitely not pay full price and I do believe the four star is a self-rating.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albury, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSmall clean room but typical of Metro\u201d", "Author": "BellaOlive", "ReviewID": "UR116595105", "Content": "Room was small and non fuss.

I have stayed in a number of hotels and usually opt for 4.5-5 star properties but as i live in Sydney i just wanted something for me and my new wife to enjoy a quiet night together. Before i chose my accommodation i looked up some properites in wotif.com. Once i decided on a property i liked i looked up their website and chose the best 3 properties for me to consider (this time around i chose properties for both value and comfort when i usually go by Trip Advisor recommendations). At end of my research i chose the Metro Hotel on Pitt due to the fact the room i chose (Superior Deluxe Queen) looked very comfortable and modern (i was told they had been recently rennovated). As i was on their website i decided to book my accomodation at that time. Booking was easy and the rate was very affordable. NOTE: I always research my hotels in depth. This way i know what they offer and i am not sprung and surprises when i get there. This take a bit of time but it always helps in the long run. Read bout a hotel by its website before you choose it. If a Travel Agent recommends a hotel i still suggest you look it up first. The day before we were due to check in i called reservations to confirm everything was ok and sure eniough it was. They were very helpful with my questions regarding parking directions (none available on site) and other things that i needed to bring along. Check in went extremely well. I dont believe a word of what those other people said about this hotels staff not being helpful. Each staff member i spoke to was more than happy to help and always smiled. I even had a good laugh with the check in receptionist and it certainly helped me feel at ease. The hotel restaurant is small but very quaint. We stopped off for a drink before heading off to our dinner in Darling Harbour (a short 10 minute walk). The bar manager was very friendly and funny which put us in a good mood for dinner. Check out was easy and again the morning staff (or afternoon by the time we left) were very friendly. They stored our bags as my wife wanted to punish me with some shopping at Pitt Street Mall (5 minutes walk from the hotel). Once we collected our bags the porter walked us out and gave us directions back to the parking building (parking was only $25.00!! I have spend over $35.00 ++ at some hotels). Overall a great experience! I have family coming over from NZ all the time and i will be putting them up at this hotel no worries! I must admit some reviews were a bit of a worry but i always say that there is only ever one review that really counts..........YOUR'S! Come give this hotel a try. I do reccommend the Superior Deluxe rooms (although i see they have a King Spa room which looks pretty nice as well :-)", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cThe worst stay in my hotel experience\u201d", "Author": "Hephaestus", "ReviewID": "UR22846488", "Content": "This is just the first day that I book into this hotel and I already feel that this is going to be my worst hotel stay ever. I feel that the service of the reception of this hotel is real terrible. I suspect even to a certain degree that the staff is racist as I am a Chinese. When I book into the hotel and enquire about the parking as they don't have a parking in the hotel. The staff direct me to the parking 2 streets away that the hotel have a contract with for cheaper parking rate. When asking for the exact direction and what to look out for to know that it's the right car park, he answered in an impatient tone like I am some moron who don't even understand simple instructions. And only after much attempt, then I realize that he's referring to the world square parking. After checked into the room, we found the blue button (to watch the movie) and the on/off button of the remote not working. When we told the reception that the remote on/off is not working, he told us we have to wait till tomorrow. But when we inform him that the blue button is not working, he told us he will come up to take a look. The whole process of coming up took him 10-15 min. After checking the system, he told us that we have to wait for tomorrow then he can get someone to take a look so we cannot watch movie for the night. So we told him to get us an internet access and what are the package available. He told us there's a 24 hours package for 29 AUD. We thought that's the longest package available and thus we opt for it. But only when we connected to the hotel internet website, then we realized that there's actually a 3 days package for 44 AUD. We had not entered our password to activate the package, so we call him to enquire about changing or upgrading the package to the 3 days package. He told us that he had already charged the 1 day package to us and cannot be undone. I am a system analyst. I don't believe there's any system designer stupid enough to design a billing system without a reversal process or functionality. I also believe not company is moron enough to buy such a system that if they bill wrongly, they cannot reverse the billing and redo it. I believe he's just plain lazy and lack of good customer service to go the extra miles to do this for us or maybe he's paid commission based on what he billed us.

Our problem's started with the Metro before we even got there. We had booked 3 months in advance through a manager who was on duty at the time and she gave us a special deal as we were booking 2 rooms. It turned out this Manager didn't even work there anymore and when rang up to organise child minding so we could go to the casino one night they couldn't find our booking. It took 4 different people and finally they gave up and said they would take the booking there and then. But not at the rate quoted. Finally after arguing for ages they gave us the originally rate. Then i was advised they didn't even have child minding facilities and I must of been misinformed, even though it states it on their own website. Not to worry. We checked in fine. The hotel seemed to be clean. Although we had payed more to upgrade our rooms we found out later that all the rooms were the same throughout the hotel, after speaking with them they advised us we couldnt have our extra $15 charge back a night because our room was on a higher floor. WOW!! So anyway we dropped our stuff and headed off. Great thing about this hotel is the location, close to tonnes of pubs, restaurants, public transport its awesome. Later that night we returned to go to bed, layed on the bed AND IT BROKE!! So AGAIN we were on the phone to reception who said they would have someone up. An hour later still noone so we rang again they said someone was on the way. It was 2am before someone finally arrives and all he did was throw the mattress on the floor and said they will deal with it the next day. Since we were so buggered we just went to sleep. Next night when we came back to the hotel the room was still the same. Bed on the floor. We rang reception to see if it was going to be fixed and they said they had no record of us ringing it through *Sighs* So anyway apparently the french lady on the phone said noone was able to do anything til a manager returned in the morning. Again we slept on the floor. I dunno about you but i reckon you can find a park bench a lot cheaper and comfortable for less than $145. The next day they finally decided to move our rooms. But instead of taking our luggage for us, or the portacot which was supplied, they expected us to do it ourselves. Our next room was exactly the same. Only in this room the toilet never flushed and the heating/air con never worked. *Sighs* Our last problem happened at checkout. We had gotten breakfast each day as an extra. We asked just for two adults each day even though we have a 1yr old. Upon paying the bill we questioned the 3 breakfasts daily. They had charged us for our son's breakfast even though he had weetbix and formula milk for breakfast WHICH WE SUPPLIED OURSELVES. We didn't even use their cutlery. He normally had his breakfast in the room before we had ours. To much of our disgust, they refused to waive the charges even though a waitress confirmed he never eat the breakfasts. Finally in a huff we left. Problems however didn't stop there. We left for melbourne on a sunday and it was wednesday after we were home i went to pay some bills with my credit card we had used for checkout from the hotel and i was in shock when i found it declined. i quickly rang my bank and they said i was overdrawn. She read out the last transactions. THE HOTEL HAD CHARGED ME NOT ONCE, NOT TWICE, BUT THREE TIMES!!!! They had charged me for the other room that i had my partner's parents staying in even though they paid for their room, and they then charged me another lot. After ringing the hotel back and demanding there money they now refuse to give it back so i have to wait a darn 45 days til my bank reverses the payments. would i go back there?? xxxx NO!! GOOD POINTS - Just up around the corner and paddy maguires they offer $5 dinner meals that are the bomb Across the road the cocktail bar has cheap deals throughout the week.

Well The Metro Hotel at 300 Pitt Street met our expectations. It was literally in the center of the city with a huge park 2 blocks away to relax and feel in nature. The main shopping drag with the big department stores was 3 blocks away. We had breakfast every morning in the QVB (Queen Victoria Building which is one block away. This is a beautiful old building converted into an upscale shopping establishment. Very nice!!! LOCATION: The main Sydney Central Rail Station is a 15 minute walk down Pitt Street or a 5 minute bus ride. There is also a train stop which is about 2 blocks away and the monorail which runs along Pitt Street. The Rocks area/Sydney Opera House/Waterfront area is about a 25 minute walk along George Street which parallels Pitt St. If you like to walk this may seem like a nice stroll, however, if you normally drive, then I would recommend any bus that goes down George street and it will be a 10 minute bus ride. ROOMS: Although some of the reviews say the room are small, we had a pretty decent size room with the bed in the center and room to walk around and put luggage. We had room 609 which faced the back of the building which we loved because it was extremely quiet!! It was great!!! The room had a refrigerator, air conditioning, and a safe which cost $2.50 per day. The room was very clean and the daily bottle water left by our bedside was a really nice touch. There is also an electric tea kettle, with tea bags, wine glasses, champagne flutes, tea cups. This hotel is not fancy by any means, but they have put some thought into practical, complilmentary little necessities that come in nicely.

Staff were friendly and helpful. We were in a queen size room with no view at all but the room was good enough. Nice sheets and comforter. A little small considering we were both lugging around a total of 6 pieces of luggage. The room was quiet and clean. We were able to set the thermostat but the forced air was a bit on the loud side. The hotel is situated in the heart of the business district within steps of chinatown, darling harbor, numerous restaurants and bars, etc. We walked all over and we were still quite close to the opera house, botanical gardens, Circular Quay, and the Rocks. There is a restaurant on the ground floor called Paradiso and it was quite lovely. They offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it is quite affordable. One night i had prawns in a lime, chili marinara llinguine and she had the grilled baby octopus and both plates were under $20 AUD. Breakfast was also good and goes for about $10 AUD. There are several hotels nearby but this one is truly a good balance between price and quality. A very lovely hotel and a lovelier price. I recommend very strongly.

The hotel does have its own restaurant, but with the number of other options in the area I never got around to trying it. The only slight drawback is that the street outside can be quite noisy - as noted earlier the Monorail is there (and starts at 6.30am), but it's also one of the main roads into the central business district. If you are a light sleeper it would be advisable to ask for a room away from the street (most of them are). I didn't have a problem with the noise level in a street facing room, but I am sure that some people will.
