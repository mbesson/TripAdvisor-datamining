I had read the reviews here and to be frank I expected worse. Concerning the noisy S-bahn, I'd like to say that we were put on the 2nd floor (that is in the same height as the S-bahn train), but our room was in the front side of the building, and so the noise was negligible. My guess is that rooms in the back of the building have some more amount of noise because the S-bahn line is behind the hotel. But my experience in a few words: no problem with the S-bahn. The rooms were very clean, and not small at all! The breakfast was very nice. Disadvantages for me: a) I'd prefer the room was a little bit more warm (wasn't cold but I come from a warmer country), b) The flow of water in the shower was a bit low. c) While the bed was double like we ordered, the mattress wasn't one double, but 2 singles!!! I stayed 5 nights at the hotel in room 209 and I got to say that it is excellent value for money.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cOn the Tracks!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Orielpk", "ReviewID": "UR7431986", "Content": "Only for railway fans.
