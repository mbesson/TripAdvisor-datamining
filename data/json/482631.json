{"Reviews": [{"Content": "We were really pleased! Given the price of the Hotel Colorado that we managed to get on venere.com, we weren't expecting 4 star accommodation- in fact, we were expecting 1 star... The hotel was easy to find, and close to the centre of florence, as advertised. When we arrived our room wasn't ready but they let us get changed and washed and leave our bags witht hem until we wnated to check in, which was fine for us. The room was large, generally clean, with everything you needed and we felt that their service was warm and efficient. a lovely breakfast and an easy check out and again they let us leave our bags until we were leaving florence. Expect what you're paying for and you'll be really pleased, as we were.

The place is definitely not worth your money. It has a good location, but thats about it. In fact we found the place pretty scary and couldnt even stay there. The staff was friendly and helpful, but I would recommend going for a 3 star hotel and spending the extra $20 bucks. At least you will not feel as ripped off as we did when we were given the key to our room. I was extremely disappointed and it definitely was not what I expected after reading the reviews.

The downsides - you have to walk the stairs to the hotel (not really a problem unless you have many bags).

We stayed at Hotel Colorado in October 2005 with our 2 little children. If you have a lot of luggage, take a taxi from the Florence SMN train station.

There is only staff during the daytime but, guests are given keys to their room and the dingy stairway to let themselves in and out at any time. The staff is English speaking, friendly and helpful.

Our room fit our family of 4 with 1 dbl. bed and 2 singles. The rm was large with a good size bathroom and patio doors that led to balcony. My teenage son enjoyed eating pizza out there to get away from his sister. I don't know if air condition was available as it was cool during our stay. A new coat of paint would improve the rooms appearance, and there is some dirt/dust on white patio doors from construction across the way, and no screens...but no problem with mosquitos this time of year. The window in our restroom did have a screen and the restroom really was fine but shower was reminiscent of some of my trips to nontourist areas in Mexico. My children really enjoyed the buffet breakfast, which was included in rate. The staff was helpful at all times,spoke english well,and arranged our tickets by e-mail to the Accademia (a 5 min walk)and also helped us call and speak to the keepers(they spoke no english) of the Agrituismo we were to stay in near Siena. One of the negatives, is that the actual hotel is on the 3rd floor and it is a climb after walking from the bus stop(San Marco piazza) with luggage. Overall, I would say that Hotel Colorado has great rates for families and they really made us feel as though they were happy to serve us.
