This hotel is in a good location about 2 blocks from Paddington Station. The room was small (but not the smallest we have stayed at in London). However, the configuration of the furniture made it very difficult to find a place to put 2 small/medium suitcases where you could open them. The suitcases would either be where you wanted to walk or in front of the door. The room was clean and the bed fairly comfortable. There was a hot pot with tea bags and instant coffee in the room. We were in a ground floor room near the reception so it was a little noisy, but not too bad. Unfortunately the windows to the room did not open so it was a little stuffy but fine since we were so tired from our day. If it were very warm out, it would have been uncomfortable. Full English breakfast (sausage, ham, egg, beans, toast, coffee/tea, and juice) were included in the price and it was pretty good. They serve breakfast downstairs which keeps some of the noise away from the rooms. All of the staff were very nice and friendly. This is a fine hotel for a short stay, but may not be comfortable for a longer stay. But, the price was very reasonable for London (70 pounds per night) and for being so close to the metro.", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cDon't go there!\u201d", "Author": "one-romanian_artist", "ReviewID": "UR7483782", "Content": "This hotel is not at all as the photos from the website and from the internet!

They have no fridge as they say, no mirror as in the photos, the tv was not working, no towels when we checked in (we had a horible twin in the top of the building) and the guy from the reception charged me before seeing the room! Then he told is not his fault they are not towels, and the photos are different! He promised to give us another room,which he never did,and when i was asking him why happens all this,he simply played he doesn't hear! Finally, he changed the tv with one which was working.
