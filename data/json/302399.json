The location is in the Odaiba area, so a little out of the way but Japan's excellent rail system gets you into the heart of Tokyo in well under half and hour. You do get what you pay for, a large spacious room, attentive staff and excellent service. The spa is also good but a little expensive.On the downside, they are extremely strict about no one checking in before 3pm, which is up to them, but can be very annoying if you haven't slept in 36 hours, are desperate for a bed and it's 2:55pm! The restaurants inside the hotel are overpriced but there are loads of quality restaurants within 5 mins walk from the hotel. Also, be careful making phone calls, when we checked-out we had a nasty shock with the phone bill - they charged us nearly \u62e245 for a 9 minute phonecall to the UK made in the middle of the night.

Don't be put off by the fact that it is in Odaiba. This is actually a plus as the Hotel Nikko is a perfect escape from the frantic pace of downtown Tokyo. At the end of our trip, we stayed one night in a hotel in Shinjinku and much prefered Odaiba. The monorail is very easy to use with English instructions on the ticket machines. The hotel itself is exactly what you would expect from a large, top-class hotel such as this with all of the usual amenities and services. We didn't eat in the hotel but instead tried the various places nearby. If possible, book a bay view room as the view across the river of Tokyo and the rainbow bridge is truely breathtaking. I'd also recommend going to the Odaiba Onsen Monogatari for an amazing Japanese spa experience (even if it is a spa theme park!). It's only two stops away from the Hotel Nikko on the monorail and is an excellent means of doing something very Japanese while still recovering from jetlag.", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR409647641", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ALEXAJ"}, {"Content": "Unbelievable Stay Although we stayed here in February, I wanted to write a semi-quick review of this hotel since we might come back in July. First of all, the location is phenomenal; the monorail is literally a 30 second walk from the hotel, so you can get into the heart of Tokyo no problem. Now for the usual wows: the hotel was super clean (no wonder, it's Japan), the service severely friendly and helpful, the room with the jaw-dropping view and a sexy (and quite large) LCD TV with HD capability was very useful, and the stay overall was nostalgic. My wife and I highly recommend this hotel, which is located in one of the nicest regions of Tokyo (Odaiba). And I hope we'll be back there in July, I'll try to take some nice photos to post here.

Sorry for posting this review only 4 months after my stay at Nikko Hotel. I simply forgot... I stayed there for a training event last Dec. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and with its breathtaking view of the Rainbow Bridge, it was wonderful.I was on the Executive Floor and the room didn't appear old to me (quite contrary to what another reviewer said). It wasn't brand new but well kept. The room was also huge and well appointed. There was also a little balcony and I remember stepping out to take pics of the rainbow bridge. Most rooms have a view of the bridge.The hotel is also located right next to malls in Odaiba, and even the restaurants there offer great views of the area. Plenty of things to do there.I don't recommend this hotel if you are not planning to spend 1 or 2 days at the Disneyland or other Odaiba theme parks. Though the hotel is directly linked to the train station, it will take you 45 mins to an hour to reach Tokyo's city centre. I tried that myself.

We were primarily going to Tokyo to see Disneyland Tokyo and Disney Sea during cherry blossom time/spring holiday. All Disney Hotels or Disney partner hotels closer to Disneyland were booked or extremely expensive. VERY reasonable price for 4 nights here through expedia.

Fantasic harbor view of rainbow bridge and Tokyo. Corner room with balcony was very spacious, comfortable king sized bed, room was extremely clean and well maintained. Very pleasant staff with good English skills. Shopping centers and many restuarants close by. Easy ride to Shimbashi station by Yurikamome monorail.

At Shimbashi Station there is a great grocer where you can purchase just about everything (produce, drinks, bento, bakery items and prepared bentos) to bring back to your room should you wish.Although you can get to Asakusa by train, the water bus on a clear day is a great way to take in the city.
