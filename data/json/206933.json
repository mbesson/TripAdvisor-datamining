The hotel is 5min walk from the main bus stop and 10min from the metro station so perfect for visiting or - as in my case - going to the Fira by bus in a very easy way. You can buy your ticket directly on the bus in cash. The hotel offers a good buffet breakfast while for dinner you can go to the restaurant just on the other side of the street. The biggest problem is that the room and especially the windows are not sound proof.

Was expecting a decent hotel, but it turned out to be excellent. Staff very very nice, polite, helpful, but never crossing any lines. Hallway absolutely new, the AC was perfect, really powerful and always working. They were cleaning, actually cleaning our room every morning, changing sheets and towels - as clean as you could possibly want a hotel room to be. Room was quite spacious, huge closet to put clothes in, safe which was perfectly \"safe\". Breakfast wasn't included and it was rather expensive - 10 euros so we didn't try it. Some good places to eat nearby - especially liked the pattisserie at Master of Fornet or something, dunno the name was in Catalan, very nearby. El Fornet is also affordable, but really average in quality. Anyways, pattisserie is definitely not something they know how to prepare in Barcelona. The view from the room was nothing lovely, but nothing unpleasant, just some funny sets of flats from nearby blocks, all with green drapes. The Bathroom is big, it even had a bidet, they provided us with soap, shampoo, just one pair of slippers and even body milk. The towels were so clean you had no problem using them, no worries whatsoever. No noise in our room, really, really quiet. The fridge was somewhat smallish but we managed. They also have their own cafe down the street - the coffee is really good. The coffee is generally EXCELLENT in Barcelona. Would really recommend it, especially if you can get a better price than the standard. Oh, and it's tops one hour walking, if you are not hurrying, from City Centre. The area is perfect, really quiet, no issues, had no problem walking down Loreto Street at midnight. The simplest way to reach the metro is to Hospital Clinic. Entenca is not nearer, neither farther, it is however more complicated to reach and the streets are not as nice as the ones taking you to Hospital Clinic, the metro station (Hosp.

The hotel was great generally, I'll share below my experience: The arrival to the hotel wasn't very easy because all the types of transportation that I knew before travelling was either go to Sants station by train from Terminal 2 in the airport and walk for not less than 20 minutes to the hotel, or from Sants take the metro to Hospital Clinic station which is also 15 - 20 minutes walk, or last option would be taking Aerobus to Plaza Espanya or Plaza Catalunya and take anything to the hotel (which I didn't know). I chose taking the metro to Hospital Clinic, but still it was a bit tiring to walk for 20 minutes with your luggage, yet the location of the hotel is easy to find, you'll find it on the map clearly. After spending the week in Barcelona I figured out that there were easier ways to reach the hotel than the above ways: 1- Take the Aerobus from the airport (ticket 5.30 EUR) to Plaza Espanya and either take a taxi (around 10 EUR with your luggage) or take a bus from Plaza Espanya that goes to Josep Taradellas street, and ask the driver about the nearest station (I can't remember the name) 2- Take the train from Terminal 2 at the airport to Sants Station and from there take a taxi or a bus that goes to Josep Taradellas street Checking in was seamless, it took us only 15 minutes and the guy at the reception assigned us a smoking room in the only smoking floor (second floor) First impression on the room was that it was too small and very clean, but actually we didn't face a problem with the size of the room after putting our luggage away from the passage in the room. Bed was too small, I guess it was smaller than a queen size bed. Bathroom was very good and spacious. The room had a small TV with very bad location in the room not viewable easily from the bed, but who will need a TV while staying in Barcelona? View was very bad from the room, so actually we didn't pull the curtains across our entire stay. Room had a safety box, and free WiFi which worked fine. Sometimes I could hear other people talking in the rooms next to me, but that was very occasionally. Rooms were cleaned daily, and toileteers were provided and towels were changed. So room service was very good. Staff in the reception were more than helpful, they were not bored from tourist's too many question, always helped in directions and recommended attractions, city map was always available with them to explain to you all what you need. Breakfast was ok, for me it wasn't superb as I don't eat pork so my options were few, yet all food tasted really good. Location of the hotel is in a quite area, very close to several bus stops that can take you anywhere in the city, journey to Plaza Espanya is 10 minutes, to Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas 15 - 20 minutes, but as I said it's not very near to a metro station so you better rely on buses for your transportations. There are many bars, cafe's and supermarkets around the hotel. On your way back with the bus it's a 5 minutes walk to the hotel, and even if you'll catch the night buses they stop in a very close bus stop around 5 mintes walk as well. So generally I liked the hotel a lot, but for me I would prefer if I stayed in a closer hotel to a metro station to avoid the busy streets during the buses journey.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, bad room.\u201d", "Author": "LorenzoFogg", "ReviewID": "UR115563056", "Content": "The hotel is quite high level (deserves 4 stars).

To get there from public transport wasn't very easy but we got the train from the airport to Sants Station and walked - if you wish to get there this way we would recommend printing off a map. The walk takes about 15-20 minutes. The closest metro was Entenca which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The walk is pretty safe and we felt comfortable walking back from the station at night (11pm) The hotel is more of a UK 3 Star standard and is perfectly nice for a short break. We appeared to be the youngest people/couple there. Most other guests were families or older couples. The bedroom was good - smaller than expected but it had a good bath and shower. There was also a free safe which was great and a mini bar that has room for your personal drinks purchases. I'm dubious as to whether the rooms are as sound proofed as claimed as we wanted a siesta about 2 -4pm and the noise from the hotel staff cleaning other rooms was incredibly loud. We could hear their conversations and clattering in the corridor. They were very good at changing the sheets everyday (if requested) and providing new towels if needed. The bed was comfortable and we loved the pillows too! It's a shame that there was no tea and coffee making facility which would have made the room that little bit better. Around the hotel there are a few restaurants and tapas bars - I'd advise you to walk around the area as it is quite pretty and you can stumble upon some reasonably priced eating venues. This was particularly great for when we were too tired to take the metro to go into town for dinner and instead decided to explore the area around the hotel. Breakfast was good. However it seemed that the kitchen was understaffed, there was only one woman serving so don't be surprised if it takes about 20 mins before you're asked if you would like a tea or coffee. Also note that tea seems a strange request. The woman was happy to provide refills of coffee but for those who like tea, one small pot is given and you'd have to specifically request another as she will not just automatically offer you more for some reason. Not to mention, the kitchen staff are not very friendly or at all quick at assisting you for anything extra you may need. Furthermore, the \"hot\" buffet breakfast that apparently consists of eggs made to your choice, bacon and sausages is also never offered. There is a \"menu\" on each table that states the breakfast, however to have the hot breakfast I imagine you have to stop the waitress and ask her as it was never just automatically offered. It was quite confusing - we're still not sure if you either have the hot buffet breakfast or the cold buffet breakfast consisting of ham, cheese, fruit and breads - and you may not be allowed both. On our last day we asked for a boiled egg, which we got ... if not a good 25 minutes later. The reception staff were really fantastic and friendly. We forgot a few random things and asked if they had them - without hesitation they very professionally went and found the items for us - thank you! They were also multilingual. As it was my partner's birthday I had been in contact with the hotel prior to our visit and asked if there was anything little that they could add as a complimentary birthday treat - as has often been offered at other hotels I have stayed at for special occasions. I was informed in an email that as it was his birthday they would give us a \"special room\". This was definitely not the case. Especially because as soon as we arrived they asked us if we wanted two single beds or a double - so they obviously were not too prepared for our stay despite emailing beforehand. In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel for a nice short break and also if you don't mind being little far away from the tourist attractions - having said that, it only takes just over half an hour to get to the beach (with one change on the metro) so as long as you don't mind not having Barcelona on your doorstep, this is a very good choice for a place to stay.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Pleasant\u201d", "Author": "dawn1410London", "ReviewID": "UR97840379", "Content": "Very good value hotel, with clean rooms and everything necessary for a nice trip.

We travelled with our car, solution that we would think twice about in the future if we didn't absolutely want to take as much gear as we did. This because parking is very expensive, impossible to find in town so the hotel charges 18 Euros per day. Driving in town is also very dangerous until you understand that you have to push people out of the way with your bumper if you want to go anywhere. The hotel is located out of the center, in a very nice, calm and safe neighborhood, right beside one of the main stops of the Tourist Bus line - a very cheap way of visiting Barcelona as local busses and metro can end up costing a lot more depending if you want to visit or spend you time at the beach. There are many take-away food places at walking distance from the hotel (less than 10 minutes). Rooms were of good size and very clean, bedding changed daily if you want them to (put a little sign on the door), otherwise they just clean and make the bed with the same covers. Bathroom had a sizeable bathtub. Beds were very comfortable if you like them medium soft, and 2 extra pilows were available in the wardrobe. For a simple double room, we still got a table and two chairs (1 armchair, 1 at the desk) and still had enough room to stock several bags and move around with ease. The free safe in the room came in handy. The minibar was stocked daily at a steep price as usual. For 14 Euros per person per day (you can get a speacial for 7 Euros per person per day if you stay long enough) you get eggs made to your choice and either normal or local sausages or bacon and a contiental buffet breakfast that was absolutely perfect, a very large choice of breads, pasteries, juices, cereal, local cheese and meats. Overal, if you get the 7 Euro deal it's more than worth it. I was 5 months pregnant when we went there and definetly enjoyed.

Across the road is the Gran Derby (sister hotel) which has a sunbathing area and small pool (about 20ft x 10ft). When I was there there weren't many kids so the pool was not anywhere near crowded. As the pool is effectively on the roof, it is high up and for those with little kids, there wasn't a safely rail by one of the potential drops - just a few plant pots, so I had a minor panic when my son's ball went over and he was lening over to see where it was!. The reception staff all spoke english very well and were extremely helpful with local info re taxi's, buses etc. The only criticisms...no bin in the room other than tiny bathroom one (so easily filled with all the mags,papers etc taken on the plane!), and the bathroom tiles could do with regrouting. Overall for a weekend break this hotel is great, though prbably more suited to adult than families. For those wanting to see the impressive Nou camp, the local bus is 1 mins walk away and takes about 10mins to get there for E1.40 each - cheaper than tram or taxi. The city tour buses are also worth using...hop on/off system on set routes - E22 adults and multilingual commentary through including headsets. There is certainlyp plenty to do in Barca. Book excursion tickets from UK as they work out significantly cheaper than \"at the gate\" prices.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201creasonable hotel\u201d", "Author": "alanmoore1981", "ReviewID": "UR77400580", "Content": "great wee place to stay in barca as its clean, well looked after and friendly!!! has a pool (definate bonus as far from the beach) although you do have to cross the street to the sister hotel to use it, not a major prob but just a wee bit of a hassle.

We didn\u2019t have breakfast as the continental room service breakfast was nearly 20euro and we were not informed about breakfast in the restaurant when we checked in so I can\u2019t comment on this. There didn\u2019t seem to be soundproofing in rooms. We could hear the conversation of the people in the next room very clearly, furniture being dragged across the floor from upstairs, room doors closing and conversations in the hall were loud even though we had double doors into our room. This was our major gripe although we were only in the room mainly to sleep in the good sized comfortable beds. Room was cleaned every day with sheets changed every second day and most days we got a chocolate on our pillow, which was a nice touch. No outdoor space to relax in this hotel although you could use the Gran Derby Hotel pool across the road but this was a small area and only around 9 sunbeds which were all taken on the both occasions we tried. Free Internet available in the lobby on one computer which was handy. This hotel is in a good location but about 20 minutes walk from a metro so we used the excellent Barcelona bus service. Buses to everywhere in Barcelona and accommodated by stops all within 5 minutes of the hotel \u2013 fantastic (bus map is required for numbers and stops and can be from picked up from metro stations). We used the T10 ticket (10 journeys for 7.95euro \u2013 single journey 1.40euro) which you also get from metro stations and this allows travel on bus, metro and tram. Barcelona is not a city that takes too many credit cards. Take plenty of cash with you and if using cards then take your passport for ID.

We were told that the hotel was local to attractions and that it was 4 * . On arriving I was surprised at the small reception area. The staff were friendly and we picked up out key to room 428. The trip upin the escalator was interesting as the door kept on closing on us as we were trying to go into it! We eventually got up tot he room and was pleased with this and the cleanliness was very good. The TV was a disappointment as there was only 2 English news channels although we were out most of the time so was happy to look over this. Having arrived early evening we decided to tke advantage of the hotels restaurant and bar. On reaching the reception downstairs however we reaslised that this was in fact shut and the restaurant only open for breakfast. We could see the bar from outside but this was locked off and not in use. We were told that there was a restaurant next door and that this was part of the hotel. We did venture into this but it was completely shut off from the hotel and did not feel like it was part of the hotel either. This restaurant was very casual with basic decor and dinner. It was not somewhere you could spend the evening or even longer than 1/2 hour as it did not have that feel to it. On day two we decided to venture into the city centre but were told that it was outside of walking distance. We were using the tour bus to get about or a taxi to get into the center. Taxis were however costing approx 10 euros per journey. in the evening we stayed local but found we were restricted in the amount of resturants and bars around. My main gripe with the hotel is how can it be classified as 4 * with a lack of available amenities. The second gripe I had was the noisy at night. We were in a front facing room so dont know if this made a difference. We had refuse collectors collecting rubbish throughout the small hours whilst we were trying to sleep and this was EVERY night. It was SO noisy. Bottles were being thrown around and at times it sounded like thunder as it was so noisy. the workers chatted loudly outside as they went about their duties too. I was waking up for breakfast so tired each morning!! Overall I would say that the plus side to the hotel is that it is very clean and the staff are nice.

Bathroom is functional, equipped with a Grohe shower system. Slightly more than the usual complementary toileries - mouthwash, conditioner, shampoo, shower gel, body milk.
