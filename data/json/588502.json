Surrounded by shopping, restaurants and bars.As others have said it was difficult to be understood; not so much at reception, more so in the locality since it is not really a tourist area. We struggled even to buy a hot cup of coffee one morning. Pointing seemed to suffice for the rest of the time. The apartments are also quite difficult for taxi drivers to find and we got out at the subway station most times and walked the short distance back.The traffic in the vicinity was horrendous, as they were preparing for the Olympics, it may well have settled down by now. It was about a 20 minute walk to Tianaman Square and a bit further to Wangfujing, the main tourist area.The breakfast spread didn\u9225\u6a9b look very nice \u9225?quite greasy, but we just stuck to toast and coffee. Also the pool area was in the basement and a bit gloomy, not somewhere you would want to spend a lot of time. Neither of these really mattered to us.It was great having the extra space of an apartment, and no doubt a very good choice for families, but I think next time I would perhaps choose to be closer to the tourist sites.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR294195593", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Ally11"}, {"Content": "will stay again at the hwa very nice value hotel in a great location. if you are looking for a decent, clean, safe hotel in beijing that is also relatively inexpensive, then this is it. not exactly close to tianamen sq, unless a 30minute walk is good for you.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR477699886", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "dappie"}, {"Content": "It gets the job done!

We extended our room for another 4 nights because we found the hotel to be a great place to stay. We chose this hotel after reading the helpful reviews posted by previous guests. The hotel is an excellent value. We booked the 2 bedroom business suite, providing plenty of room for us and our 2 children ages 10 and 12. We also booked an extra bed. As mentioned in previous reviews, yes, the decor may be tired but keep in mind this is not a 5 star hotel. It is however,clean, comfortable, in a safe area and all amenities work well. There is a full kitchen, large shower, bath, 2 televisons, dvd player and internet access in the room. What is also useful is the washing machine. The children enjoyed swimming in the pool. Breakfast was good with adequate choice for us. There were always 2 soups, 2 kinds of eggs, toast, ceareal and a variety of local breakfast items which were fun to sample. The front desk staff tries hard to communicate in english. Luckily, we found a wonderful local guide,by chance, at the on our first day here. I would highly recommend her. It was nice to go at our own pace and our children really enjoyed her. We went to the Great Wall in her private car and she arranged other tours and tickets for us as well. We had not arranged tours prior to our arrival. We had done this before on other trips but I must admit, the language barrier makes it challenging here. Overall, considering the location-right in the heart of a very busy shopping area with restaurants all around, near the subway, taxi stand, not far from the major attractions of the city and the value for the price of the room, we felt lucky to have chosen this hotel for our stay in Beijing.", "Date": "Aug 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR704332993", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Cynthia_7"}, {"Content": "Good Value booked via Ctrip.Booked a 2 bedroom business suite for 788 per night.Hotel is above a very busy shopping complex, the area has lots of busy shops nearby, Mcdonalds, KFC, Starbucks accross the road.Shops nearby are expensive.There is a taxi rank about 2 Metres from the Front Door.The room itself was acceptable, kitchen had seen better days though.

We deliberately opted for an apartment over a hotel for the extra space, given the length of our stay. The hotel is fine, but it definitely falls in the 2-3 star category (I've seen websites describing it as a 4-5 star - which it most definitely isn't). Rooms are a good size, and whilst clean, could definitely do with some TLC - our room had cracking paint, loose floorboards, and some very tired looking furniture. But the bed was comfortable and it was a real bonus to have a washing machine in the room. We had a room that overlooked the roof garden, which I definitely recommend as it was very quiet and gives you the option of opening windows / doors without being subjected to traffic din.The breakfast was fairly ropey, but we never had a problem filling up, and for the price (\u62e245 a night) we were just happy that breakfast was included at all.As other reviewers have noted, staff don't have the greatest grasp of English, but then our Mandarin is non-existent so we weren't complain about that.The Forbidden City is about 20 mins' walk away, but the metro station is nearby and taxis are cheap for when the distances become too great.Overall, we had a good experience at the hotel, but a few things jarred with us. Firstly, for such a low rent establishment, the prices they charged for things like drinks, tours, calls etc were exorbitant and more suited to a 4 or 5 star place. Seek other options to avoid being ripped off.Secondly, the hotel insists on holding a deposit of 500 RMB (about \u62e235) rather than the more standard credit card imprint. This means you have to wait around when checking out for a staffer to inspect your room before you get it back (which'd be a nightmare when they're busy). Plus it sticks you with either foreign transaction charges for debiting / crediting the deposit if you use a card, or a wad of Chinese cash when you leave - a real pain if, like us, you're only going to the airport afterwards.", "Date": "May 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR989747587", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Paupy"}, {"Content": "Recommended for family travel with young children We just returned from China. Staying at HWA apartment made our Beijing trip easy and comfortable!The lobby is tiny but it does not matter to us. We booked business suite with two bedrooms (one king bed and one single bed) and two bathrooms, comfortable beds, clean and spacious room...etc.. (They probably just remodelled the room.) Sound insulation is good. The kitchen is equipped with micro wave, stove, fridge and oven but we rarely use it as KFC, pizza hut and MacDonald are near that made my kids happy!Free internet access is available in the room. The staffs were efficient when we needed their help to check the internet line. Also free city calls. Washing machine inside the bathrrom really helps for travellers with young children. No dryer but clothes dry completely over night.Location is convenient. Two department stores, supermarket and subway station are close to the hotel. There is only one stop to Tienanmen square. It is about 110 RMB by taking taxi to airport from the hotel.Breakfast is available from 7 to 10 am. The restaurant is clean, mainly Chinese breakfast with few western breakfast such as toast bread, bacon, eggs...etc. Food quality and taste are superior.Hotel staffs are nice and helpful. Since I speak Mandarin, I am not sure how helpful they are to help foreign guests.....There is only one minor thing that I think the hotel can do better. It has limited flexibility for late check-out.

I stayed here for 2 weeks with my husband and my Mum - it was ideal as we had a double bedroom, a single, a living room and a kitchen. There was plenty space for all of us and the suite had everything we needed. We even had a computer with internet access which was great for staying in touch back home without breaking the bank.The housekeeping staff were great and tidied our messs - great as there was no washing liquid for us to do it (terrible excuse I know!) and kept us topped up with bottled water and fresh fruit. They spoke no English but a 2-way Chinese dictionary and enthusiastic sign language worked perfectly for all concerned!The reception staff spoke limited English but were friendly and helpful (especially when my husband needed to get to a hospital at 5:30am where he was diagnosed with pneumonia! Incidentally if you get ill, there is a western clinic in the Lufthansa Centre and an amazing ex-pat run hospital called The United Family Hospital on the outskirts of the city centre - you should find phone numbers in most big guidebooks!)The hotel location is great, just away from the touristy areas but within walking distance of Tiananmen. Mind you, the cabs are so cheap, it is easier to hail one and do your walking when you get there-Beijing is BIG!There is a basic restaurant that serves a free breakfast and a huge food court that serves all kinds of Beijing-related fast food! If you are the sort of traveller that likes to play it safe, get a cab into somewhere like Wanfujing Street as the hotel food court can be a bit daunting-dog food restaurants and the like! We grabbed takeaway from Yoshinoya several times to eat back at our suite when we were too tired to go out again!I would totally recommend this hotel to people who are returning to Beijing.
