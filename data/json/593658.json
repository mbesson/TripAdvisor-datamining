Everything on Orchard is within walking distance from the hotel. Check-in: I was informed I was being upgraded upon check in however I actually asked if its possible to request fro a room facing the other side because the rooms facing Paragon has a metal shade which blocks the light from coming in. Unfortunately there are no rooms available so I had to settle with it. Room: Room is small but adequate\u2026it's okay for a solo traveller but I think if you had a companion it would be a tight squeeze. Specially after spending days of shopping and all the loot is scattered on the hotel room floor. The only thing bothering me is the photo on top of the headboard.

Location is excellent, directly opposite Paragon arcade, and close to Mardarin hotel, Takashimaya and Nee On City. Entrance is at Bideford Road, and from the entrance at ground level one has to take a lift to 4th Floor and walk across the entire length of the hall to the passenger lifts at the end of the hall. Hotel was booked in HK via travel agent. Prepaid room price was slightly over US$300 per night all in. Breakfast was included. Here comes the tricky part: the hotel has a gigantic electronic billboard on its front facing Orchard Rd. The electronic billboard was hellishly noisy, emitting bright lights throughout the entire day non-stop from 9:30 a.m. until 11:30 p.m. each and every day. To add insult to injury, in addition to the monstrously large and noisy electronic billboard, the hotel's bar located on 4th Floor is visible from certain rooms. The rooms most affected are located near the passenger lifts. The bar is a noisy place and the noise is IN ADDITION to the noise from the electronic billboard. We didn't know this at check-in, and they tried to slip us a noisy room on the 7th floor next to the lift. But as soon as we opened the room door we knew we were screwed as the noise was deafening, and while we were looking down to the bar 3 floors down, people sitting in the bar were looking up at us ! there was absolutely no privacy. We asked for a room change pointing out the noise issues and to the hotel's credit, they obliged without any struggle and we were given a smaller room on 10th floor looking at the back. The view wasn't great at the back but at least it was quiet. The room size was small but passable, all the equipment worked properly. Minibar prices were exorbitant but that is to be expected in this class of hotel. The bed was OK, the room was clean. The aircon is slightly colder than it should but one quickly gots used to it. Straits Times newspaper was delivered daily in the morning and placed in a slot outside the room for pickup by guests. Breakfast was included and it was quite OK, the best part is the fresh fruits, lots of it. The management should seriously think about getting rid of the electronic billboard, lose the rental for that monstrous piece of equipment, but gain lots of appreciative customers who will stay there again. Those rooms with window which looks down at the bar and vice versa should be turned into function rooms, as they are not suitable to sleep in. That, or they cut the size of the bar. But perhaps the hotel has a design flaw which can't be rectified easily.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service!\u201d", "Author": "iag2011", "ReviewID": "UR127454675", "Content": "Grand Park Orchard is located directly across the street from Takashimaya Dept. store and Paragon Mall.

My sister & I stayed for 2 nights for a shopping weekend & thought it was a perfect hotel to be in terms of location. The hotel itself is modern & quite new approx. 2 years old) as it was totally renovated from its days of the old Crown Prince Hotel. Rooms are rather small (compared to other hotel, such as Mandarin Orchard which is located across the road), but I purely chose this hotel because I've stayed at Mandarin Orchard & wanted to try a newer hotel. In saying that, it is still OK for a short weekend as we were hardly in the room, & it was only there for us to freshen up & sleep, all other times were spent in Orchard eating & shopping! Rooms are kept adequately clean...in addition, for a hotel which is located in the hustle & bustle heart of Singapore the rooms are comfortably quiet. Staff are polite, friendly & quite efficient. One morning I forgot to put my diamond rings & watch but they were left untouched in the room, so cleaning staff are to be highly regarded for their honesty & integrity. If I must make a weak point of the place, is that the check in lobby is located on the 4th floor & we always have to take 2 lifts in order to get to our room everytime. Not so sure as to the reason for this as both guests & non-guests can always take the lifts to the room floors without swipe/room keys, so security was a tad disappointing.

The best new malls are right beside or right across this hotel. Our room was small (deluxe) but it had very comfy beds and pillows.

Charles & Keith anyone?! There's about 3 of them located within a 1km radius :) plus tones of other great shops, restaurants and cafes. We upgraded to a crystal club floor room because there were 3 of us staying in the room. Unfortunately I have to say we were a little disappointed in the size of the room. It was quite small, defiantly not big enough for 3 people. (Lucky we were all close friends) Also when we arrived only a double bed was in the room, so we had to wait for someone to bring in a roll away bed, something which we would have expected been done prior to us arriving in the room. The breakfast on the Crystal Club floor is nothing to rave about, not much of a selection to choose from. We excpected a bit more on offer. The breakfast area on the 4th floor (where all the other hotel guests go who aren't on the Club floor go) looked like it had a better range. I coudln't really see what was so good about being on the Club Crystal floor compared to a standard floor. I would say save your money and spend it in some of the shops along Orchard ;) Also there are no power points in the bathrooms so if you want to blow-dry or straighten your hair you have to do it out where the mini-bar and mirror is located. (hard for 3 girls to share) The iron in our rooms was broken and we requested a new one, which we never received. The air-conditioning stopped working half way through one of the nights we were there, and with 3 bodies in a confined space - it got pretty hot and stuffy. Luckily the workman was able to fix it. All 3 of us found the beds very hard and uncomfortable. On the last night there I woke up with a sore neck and back. I know I sound like I'm whining a lot but my friends who stayed in the room had the same opinions so it's only fair we share them with others.

There is also a place called crystal jade in Takashimaya which offers excellent chinese food. For breakfast, there was a gloria jean's opposite hotel which had nice coffee and bakery stuff.

The only good thing is that you can access to Club floor evening cocktails and tea time. The tea time is nothing, but the cocktail is good if you drink. If not, i don't think its really worth it to pay 400 for the Club Room. For breakfast, we chose to have it at the lobby instead of the club floor. Breakfast was ok, the spread nothing much to rave about, anyway its a 4 star hotel, what can you expect. But to a little disappointment, my husband had a food poisoning shortly after that. Lasted for 2 days. Hopefully not due to the breakfast... as i did not have it. The pro is that the service is really good and prompt. Friendly and helpful staffs.

The pool was nice and relatively large for a hotel right in the middle of town (Orchard Rd neighborhood at least).

It gave my girlfriend and me a headache every time we had to pass through them! Also, this hotel has one of my pet peeves, wherein you have to take an elevator to get to the reception desk. I like my reception desk on the ground level, but that's my personal preference. Also, the hallways were rather dark and not necessarily the cleanest. The rooms were dark as well with dark colored walls and furniture. Also there was picture of a female model on the wall directly above the bed (some, not me, might call it \"art\"), which my girlfriend didn't appreciate. I wouldn't mind having a word or two with the interior designer for this building.
