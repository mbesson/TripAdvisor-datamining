The one exeception in all of this appalling senario lay with one of the reception staff, a Ukrainian gentlemen who was polite and as helpful as was possible, given the constraints of his working enviroment and the apparent hotel policy of ignoring guests whenever possible.

I have been in Rome several times and always book one of the three star hotels near Termini Station - after all Rome is itself the major star and a hotel is just somewhere to sleep in. Because of the booking sites I use to book hotels in Europe I have stayed in 3 - 4 hotels in or around the station and this was one of the best. I arrived in Rome on Thursday hot, sweaty and tired after a very early flight from Dublin. I had read the reviews on Tripadvisor and seen the negative comments but was not concerned because the positive comments appeared more balanced. The walk from Termini Station drop off point for the Terravision coach from Ciampino Airport is down on Via Marsala. Its about a 10 minute walk to the hotel. I use the Metro a lot in Rome and could have used it for the transfer to Repubblica but with a medium sized trolly case and the steep escalators in Repubblica I thought it better to walk. Check in time in Italian hotels can be as late as 2pm but I arrived at the Patria a few minutes after 12 noon. I fully expected to have to leave the case and go off and have lunch and come back later to check in. However the wonderful desk clerk told me that my room was ready so after the check in process I entered a tiny lift that took me to the 4th floor. As many hotels are in what could be classed \"listed buildings\" the lifts cannot be on the scale one finds in airports/hospitals or other public buildings. My room was Room 411. It had a strange (but not unsatisfactory) layout. The single bed was against a wall half of which was mirrored which made the room look bigger on entering. There was a reasonable sized wardrobe with safety deposit, extra pillow and blankets (which were not necessary). A bedside locker was next to the bed with the phone, radio controls and bedside light switch beside or on same. There was a long dressing table with a shallow drawer and a flat screen TV on the top. The room was L-shaped and the shower was actually in the room just opposite the bathroom. The room was clean and the mini bar had a couple of soft drinks, water, beer but no spirits. Prices are displayed on a laminate underneath the glass topped dressing table. The bathroom had a toilet in an awkward position next to the sink on one side and bidet on the other. The hotel is just around the corner from the Repubblica Metro Station - 2 - 3 minutes walk and 10 minutes down Nazionale to the Victor Emmanuel Monument. Every day I was up at around 6am and showered and dressed and down for breakfast shortly after 7am. There are about 12 tables in the breakfast room on the ground floor (up a couple of steps from the reception). The reception staff were all excellent - brilliant English and very willing to be of assistant if required. However the ladies who organised the breakfast room (and were probably part of the general housekeeping staff) had very little English but smiled and nodded at everyone. Breakfast consisted of cereal (which I don't eat), two types of juice, tea, coffee, mineral water, canned fruit, yogurt, wonderful bread rolls, processed cheese, croissants, jams and some sort of cakes which I never tried. By 8am I was out of the hotel and seldom returned before 6pm. As I ate lunch out every day (very hot and humid in Rome during my stay so a long lunch was a relief) I was not really hungry by evening. So on my way back I used to get some food from the Spar on Nazionale (50m from the hotel) and return to my room for a shower and then a drink and snack before heading out for a walk for an hour or so. The area around the hotel is perfectly safe late in the evening and the hotel has 24 hour front office staff on hand. My one and only criticism (and this is not the fault of the hotel) is that there were a number of Italian guests for the first two nights and they made quite a bit of noise returning to their rooms in the early hours of the morning. Yesterday evening I returned from my day out in Rome and advised the front office clerk that I would be checking out early this morning (this is something they ask you to do). I was going to come down last thing with the total for the mini bar ( they don't take the payment slip away every day as they do in other hotels) but he asked me for the details and I gave him a very honest answer to date and said what I might consume that evening. He did a calculation and disregarded a few things and rounded the figure up to about 10 euro less than I had already used. I paid and he said that if I came down alter he would give me the receipt but I was exhausted so I had a shower and went straight to bed. This morning I arrived down before 7am and a different clerk was on duty. I checked out and he confirmed that my room was pre paid but did not query what I had used in the mini bar the previous evening. (I know I make this sound like a mini bar review but I am used to the mini bar being cleared out the day before departure). I will definitely use the Patria Hotel whenever I go to Rome again and I am planning my next trip. The hotel is dated but clean. The staff are friendly even if they don't speak a lot of English. The locations is great. The towels may be of the thin variety but they definitely dry you and are replaced every day. My room looked over the back of the hotel and looked on to a residential block opposite. Even though the air conditioning was excellent I sometimes used to look out the window in the early morning or late in the evening and could see two things - Romans going about their daily lives opposite and smokers in the Patria who were semi abiding with the Italian non smoking room by smoking out their windows.

The location was great for it was close to termini station so we were able to walk with our luggage with no problems. The hotel was a bit of a challenge to find at first because it is located on a small side street and the map off the hotel website isn't clear because the road names in Rome are small and hidden on the side of the wall. Once it was found it was hard to believe we missed it in the first place. It was close to the metro and we walked to all the tourist sites including the colliseum, trevi fountain, forum, spanish steps etc. The only place we took the metro to was the vatican which was also easy to find and we bought a 24 hour metro pass which allowed us to freely use the subway to get around. The breakfast at hotel Patria was awful! We stayed at 3 different hotels on our stay and Patria had the worse breakfast. You were given stale buns/croissants, canned fruit, ham, jam, cereal. It was not appetizing so we would go to the grocery store and get food there. The grocery store is about a 5 minute walk down the main street so we would get fruits/veggies and store them in the minibar. If you do want to go out to eat beware of \"ZEUS\". This restaurant is just near the hotel, the food is awful! In desperation we went in cause we were so hungry and busted up $45 euros for the worse food ever. The bean soup was salty and watery, the pizza had canned mushrooms and was not fresh. We got a tempura dish that was so oily and tasteless. They will have people outside the restaurant trying to get you to come in but don't waste your money. We really loved this cafe right at Republica near the fountain. The cappincinos were reasonable, service good and you could sit outside and enjoy the view. The second part of our stay when we came back, we got put on the 4th floor.

We purchased our standard, double room in advance and we were, of course, extremely tired by the time we arrived at the hotel. Our double room was only a few feet wider and longer than the double bed that we were to sleep on. Quite a shock considering what we were used to with hotels in the states. And even though we thought we were prepared for the smaller size we had no clue that we would barely be able to squeeze our bags into the room (and we traveled pretty light). However, to the benefit of the hotel they were kind enough to switch us to a larger room (although the bed was the same size) at no additional cost and even moved our bags to the new room while we were out discovering the city. The bathroom was small but updated and we passed on the free continental breakfast as it consisted mostly of pastries, fruit cocktail and assorted cereals. Plus, the breakfast room was always full with other hotel patrons when we did decide to eat at the hotel so we just stopped going in. There are several bakeries and small food stands nearby if you need some fuel to start your day. As others have posted, it is a great starting location for just about any trip that you are planning for the day. We quickly educated ourselves on the subway (which is right around the corner from the hotel) and found that a highly effective way to get to a majority of the sites we wanted to see. We also found that many of the restaurants and pizzerias in the area around the hotel seem to cater to the tourists and they have no trouble with speaking English if your Italian is rusty.

Via Torino is very close to the Repubblica metro station, and there are a bunch of shops and things to do around there.

The breakfast room tho small was cosy and the breakfast was substantial. The hotel was very close to most of the touristy spots like the Trevi Fountain (20 mins walk), Pantheon, Spanish Steps and some great shopping strips. Our only complaints were the paper thin bath towels and napkin like face towels and the tiniest lift. But then again, most of the lifts in Europe are tiny! Diagonally across from the hotel was Dagnino Cafe which we developed a culinary affection for. A \"Have to Visit\" cafe! Yum...Another lovely cafe to eat at is Zeus Ristorante near the hotel. It is reasonably priced and tastefully decorated and served delicious meals and desserts. Check out San Crispino Gelati shop near the Trevi Fountain, serves the best and varied types of ice creams! Also worth visiting and dining at is at the Pantheon (best cafe latte/cappucino) and Piazza Navona. The Vatican City and museums & St Peter's Basilica Line are worth seeing though quite challenging in the queues to get in on a hot summer day! The St Peter's Cathedral is breathtaking! Next time we visit Rome, we shall do so in the cooler months.
