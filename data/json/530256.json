The hotel is in a great location and I was delighted to find that it was easy walking distance to the pedestrian mall which provided lots of entertainment day and night. The room views are not to be missed and the mid century modern decor is pleasing. My bathroom could have used a bit of work. Funky grout in the tub area is always a little off putting not to mention the outrageously thigh high sides on the tub which you have to climb over to take a shower. Challenging and risky for the not so young. The bar scene on Saturday night was quite frisky and loud but mild by the neighborhood standards. A neighboring rooftop bar/restaurant was blaring music until the wee hours each night. Young professionals and the young an heart will find this desirable.

We were able to get two interconnecting rooms (612 and 614) - actually with a little corridor in between the rooms. Not particularly good view from the room but OK - rooms very clean and reasonable with very reasonable bathrooms. The receptionist who took our booking and dealt with us was one of the best parts of the stay. He organised late check out for us as we had had so much trouble on BA and this was terrific. He was generally extremely helpful and actually made the whole experience much better and nicer.. We also thought the breakfast was lovely and the restaurant - Mikla was terrific. The queue to check in and check out was understaffed though and I think it would be a great improvement if the hotel could get more staff - the staff did their best but it was very difficult for them If you want a reasonably priced hotel in Pera this is a perfecctly acceptable hotel.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cGreat first impression\u201d", "Author": "Elias A", "ReviewID": "UR127982852", "Content": "I did not have an extensive experience at this hotel, but they managed to make a positive first impression.

She had not reported it to the hotel as she was not 100 % sure; as we do in that kind of situation she began to doubt herself, but she mentioned it to me so that I did not use the safe myself. In light of this I kept my money in a small bag, hidden in the inside pocket of my holdall. There was money in a few different currencies (as I had been travelling quite a bit), including 80Euro. On my second to last day, when I started packing I noticed that the 80Euro was gone. I complained to the hotel and was advised that they would, 'Look into the matter'. They never got back to me and as I knew I would not get my money back I did not pursue the matter further. I also mentioned the money my friend had lost as it seems obvious that they have a serious problem. When I got home I sent them an email about the matter and was advised that they were not responsible for my loss as I should have used the safe. My money was well hidden, so obviously the person was rooting through my belongings, which I do not expect. I have traveled extensively in the past, staying in youth hostels and budget hotels all over the world and have NEVER had money stolen from my room before. I was very very shocked and certainly would not be back. Besides this the photographs taken of the hotel pool are incredibly deceptive!

Being tall, I didn't find the bathtub to be a problem, but I can understand the concern of people shorter than me. One drawback for me was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities, along with the hotel information book and a mini-bar item price list (I'm not sure if the latter didn't actually exist, but I looked for it without result). Overall, a nice experience but not as good as the Marmara Taksim.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cPerfect in every aspect\u201d", "Author": "mariaa77", "ReviewID": "UR76412778", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel 3 nights in the middle of August and i can't find anything to complain about everything was perfectly great !!

Stepping on the damp carpet with bare feet was a disgusting experience. I was very upset and disappointed when I saw the room. No where near 4 star quality! The sheets were sort of dirty and the towels were barely white. We went downstairs to complain. They said they would try to heat the room and if we weren't happy they would change it. Even if the room did heat up it would have to be warm for more than a week to dry up the dampness in the room. After some insistance they agreed to change the room. The room we were given was totally different - dry and warm and of better quality. I wonder why they deliberately gave us such a bad room in the first place, made such a bad impression and caused us a hassle. The receptionists are kind yet condescending and lying out of their teeth. I will never stay here again and never advise anyone that i know to stay here.

We are a family of 4 and we have a really awful experience. First of all, the sheets from boths bedrooms (we booked two double rooms) had holes in several places. In one of the rooms we had only one glass, and the curtains of both rooms were teared apart. Later on, due to a confusion with our travel agency, both double bedrooms didn't include breakfast (which we thought they did, cause we already find it quite expensive after taking a look at the rooms). We did not know that, we found out when we had poor coffee into a cup, and not even given a sip and one of the waiters passes by and drops with quite bad attitude the check on the table. Right away we went to the reception to tell them our fee was with breakfast, but apparently it wasn't and they wanted to charge us the whole breakfast (the one we didn't take, and including 4 people when 1 of us was still in the room having a shower). Instead of settling something up, like we expect due to confusion that was made and the quality of the hotel, the manager called the waiter to ask him if we had taken a sip of the coffee or not to see weather to charge us or not, cause they said we were stealing from them... A real shame for a 5 star hotel, who charge that much for a room and have that kind of bad attention to the customers, calling them lyers, and instead of charging the coffee or settle something, calling the waiter to \"testify\"... I've never had that experience in my life, and even less in that kind of quality hotel. A piece of advise, if you really want a nice hotel and you appreciate the location of the marmara pera hotel, just 50 metres away you have the pera suites, we stayed there and it was marvellous, the boutique hotel is a beauty and the attention and good mood of the environment is priceless (and of course, it was half the price we were paying for the marmara pera)", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester", "Title": "\u201cexcellent\u201d", "Author": "MrMidland", "ReviewID": "UR53128260", "Content": "We truly enjoyed our stay here.

I would still say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good and clean hotel and it gives you value for your money. Location 6/10: Located in Galatasaray area (Tepebasi), the biggest advantage the hotel has, is its location at the beginning of the shopping street Istiklal caddesi, which is an all walking street, with many shops and restaurants. This street ends up at Taksim square, where you can take the metro, taxis, busess, etc.. The hotel is also quite close to the old part, where all the sightseeing places are; The Blue mosque, Hagia Sophia, The palace and of course the covered bazaar. The area have some really good restaurants, especially the very famous and popular Mikla, which is owned and run by the Swedish/Turkish chef Mehemt G\u00c3\u00bcrs. Splendid food and atmosphere, as well as view, but very difficult to get a table. Book well in advance. In the summer time their patio is amazing to dine at. Access to taxis are very good, since they small station is placed outside the hotel. Lobby/Check-in 7/10: The entrance and lobby is modern and sleek. Good seating area beside it and the staff is very friendly and help full. They knew a lot of tourist information, or they would find it for you. Umbrellas to loan if needed.. The lobby is a bit small, but its not a very big hotel, but the lobby can get a bit crowded. Had in advanced asked for a room on the higher floors, and I got it at the top. Room 6/10: Modern rooms but not the best of quality on the internal decoration and furniture. Good size room, but only one chair to sit in, for a double room. The view was amazing and the windows were able to open, to get some fresh air, but only a bit, so it was safe. The bed was very comfortable and big. A quite big flat screen TV, but mostly Turkish channels and only two English speaking. No pay movies to choose from if you were staying in, that is big minus. No radio possibility neither. Safe deposit box in the room was good. Cleaning was perfect, but they missed a few times to refill or take away half used products, such as shampoo. The bathroom was very small (see photo) and I could not sit on the toilet without having to be forced to close the door. Also, the bathtub side was quite high, so for young kids or older people, it might be a big hazardous or dangerous to get in and out, since there was no bathtub protection mat or something similar not to slip when standing and showering. The last, and minor minus, was that they used very cheap products for showering and body lotion. No brand at all and they did not smell all that well. Some negative things were that it was quite good sound proofing, so you could here people talking or the TV in other rooms or when a door was shut, as well as the sound for when the elevator arrived at that floor. There were no slippers or bathrobe. One of the major misses was the lack of an information booklet. You had no idea when breakfast was served, TV-channels, which floor the gym is on, etc.. You had to call the front desk all the time. Restaurants 9/10: This is almost as good as it gets. Mehmet G\u00c3\u00bcrs restaurants are famous in Turkey, and it should be an honour to have it in your hotel. Located at the roof, with an outside patio for the summer time. I did not get to try it this time, but I have been at all his other restaurants many time, since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a friends cousin from Sweden, and we have never been even the slightest disappointed. Its been exquisite very time. Very modern and cool setting, with dark wood and black decoration. The bar is a bit small, but ok. The wine selection is very good. The breakfast had a very good selection, with an extra menu if you wanted something special, like many kind of omelettes or a special kind of coffee, for example. What was not good, was that there were no small signs, explaining what everything contained, like there were ten different cheese with different contents, but no explanation of what. When asked, they had an explanation that the counter was new, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how new? One month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and they had not had the time to fix that yet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit small for the number of rooms they have, so it can get very crowded on the weekends, and here is one minus; the staff got less service minded the more people there were. Other: There is complimentary high speed internet access in the rooms, which is good and worked excellent. They also have a small business center with internet. The gym was small and did not contain much of equipment, but did not try it, just looked inside. The bar is long with many seats, but there were only two groups of chairs and tables. They had a big screen TV with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a thousand channels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but they did only know two of them, and I asked three different bar tenders and none could help or write down the channels as a service for others that will ask. Overall it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good value hotel. Good price for Istanbul with a modern touch.

But there are still traces of it being really rundown once upon a time. I can't put my finger on it, but it feels not all that spanking new! We were told of a 'fitness center' and 'pool on the roof'. Only to find out the fitness center is nothing more than a sweaty gutted out hotel room on the 2nd floor. And the 'pool' was nothing more than a dipping pool with a view. Our room had a fantastic view of Golden Horn and the City. But the experience was spoiled by a few nagging things. Firstly, housekeeping wasn't as meticulous as I'd expect. The sheets we tucked way deep on one end and flopping out on the other. Made it really uncomfortable to sleep in as other person in the bed always had the short side. Bath tub is really narrow and the side is just too high. Made it really precarious (especially being pregnant) climbing out after a shower. To make matters worse, the air-conditioning broke down in the middle of the night and we were left to sweat it out until someone could attend to it at 6am. BUT, the management made up swiftly for it by offering us a fruit plate and complimentary meal at the cafe. Best part of the Marmara Pera, is Mikla - its swanky Swedish Turkish restaurant on the top floor with roof garden. Highlight of our stay was watching the sunset from the roof with cocktails. If it wasn't for the professional yet friendly and efficient staff, the entire stay would have been a disaster. If you've never visited Istanbul and want to stay here, do it only for its convenience to Istiklal (shopping street). But seen Istiklal once, and it's enough.

The double bedroom was very good, yet the other room with three beds seemed to be full and no place for us to move freely inside the room. Otherwise, the breakfast was very delicious and full of different varities. The staff were very polite and nice. The wireless internet connection was available for free.
