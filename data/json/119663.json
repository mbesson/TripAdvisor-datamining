{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Bordering on substandard Location was good for walking downtown. Room was relatively clean (threadbare carpeting, holey towels and insufficient supply for immediate replacement, no towel bars, no t.p. holder, minimal soap, no hair dryer, no A.C., no do not disturb signs, etc.). NO FRILLS!Water pressure low. No shampoo, no wash cloths. Didn't even try the Breakfast. Convenient place, but will definitely try the Canterbury (Best Western) around the corner for $10 more a night next time. Really misrepresented calling it a BB! Really think it is a residential hotel.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR416082870", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Nice value given location Clean rooms: beautiful darkwood, comfortable bed, the single was small, but with a bay window (though overlooking noisy street); threadbare towels (though useable). Helpful staff (they also run the nearby amsterdam hotel). Continental breakfast is minimal (croisants, jelly, coffee). Overall, a great value for the central location (2 minute walk to cable car and bus stops, 5 minutes to chinatown markets or Union Square).", "Date": "Aug 23, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR951504240", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "stough"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d119663-r1260254-Biltmore_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "119663", "Price": "$89"}}
