{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Definately a good choice I stayed in this hotel in November 2008 and before booking I was a little unsure about it because of some of the reviews I saw. First of all I will start by saying that as I travel to Florence often I always like to stay in a hotel that is close to SMN (Santa Maria Novella) so it is easy getting to and from Pisa airport. When arriving at this hotel the first thing I noticed was that this is the closest hotel to SMN station. I must admit there was some roadwork\u9225\u6a9a and I did read that this was a problem when getting to the hotel but you can simply avoid the roadworks by taking a shortcut by going down some stairs.When I arrived at the hotel I found the staff to be very welcoming and helpful. The rooms were very comfortable and fortunately for us we were given a free room upgrade with a Jacuzzi and really nice view of the town and a balcony. The room was not as large as some hotels that I\u9225\u6a9de stayed in but I must admit it was very homely and it\u9225\u6a9a rare that I have ever stayed in a hotel that makes me feel like I\u9225\u6a93 at home. The room service was very good and you can even order cocktails to your room with no extra service charge.The deco in the hotel rooms and throughout the hotel was extremely nice and had a typical Italian feel to it. We also visited the hotel bar on one or two nights and had a few cocktails, I must say the bar staff where very warm, welcoming and down to earth. The only downside to this hotel was that the breakfast stated hot American breakfast and the only hot food that was available was boiled or scrambled eggs. There were two breakfast rooms however the larger one straight ahead was too busy, where as the smaller room to the right was much nicer and not at busy. Apart from the issue with the hotel breakfast everything else about this hotel was perfect and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "Nov 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR118203921", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "UK_traveller04"}, {"Content": "Not a 4-star establishment I must be in the Twilight Zone. The picture of the hotel is nothing like the one we stayed in. We were only there for one night on a tour, and it was undeniably the worst one night stay. Although clean, the hotel is shabby and worn. Because of the streets being ripped up, we had to lug our luggage from the tour bus and then lug it up the stairs because the elevator didn't work. The hotel is in what appears to be the worst neighborhood in Florence, next to the train station where you can hear people and trains coming and going all night. Why? Because there is no air conditioning so we had to leave our window open. We were told by our tour guide that they said it was off because of government regulations. I don't appreciate the deception.I wouldn't allow anyone I love to walk anywhere to or from this hotel at night as it is located to some sort of flophouse that also had folks coming and going all night. I have no idea what that was about, but it didn't feel safe.

Good location right opposite the railway station. Room was clean, but breakfast let the hotel down badly. We were in a group of 16 tourists and as such was given a half hour slot for breakfast. We had to eat in an overflow room which was cluttered with too many plastic tables and chairs. Many tables were uncleared, and one had to fight your way to a table. What food there was, was very basic. Not even a toaster ! Coffee was awful. Next morning we dined individually in the main breakfast room which proved a little better as the tables had table cloths and were spaced out better. There was even a toaster here!

We'd booked a luxury junior suite with jacuzzi. The new part of the hotel has a very tasteful entrance lobby, and we were directed to a room on the first floor. The room was at the front of the hotel facing the duomo, which could be seen in the distance. The room was very nicely decorated although a small. The jacuzzi was tiny, but tastefully decorated bathroom. There were doors that openned out onto a balcony, but where as in the past they must of had dividers between the balcony and the one next door, they no longer did, instead large holes in the concrete where these must have once been. So the balcony was rather communal. However the room was very comfortable, and with the balcony doors shut you couldn't hear the traffic.Breakfast the next day was rather an experience as the dinning room was obviously in process of being renovated. It felt like being in an army mess. Chaos really, tables uncleared, everyone milling around trying to get breakfast. Only the milk was off, the rolls had run out and there weren't any cereal bowls. We weren't impressed.However on the other days of our stay we were directed to a different dining room, lots of space, a TV and a breakfast room full of food, other people were being directed to the mess area !The hotel was very central and easy to walk to all the areas from, it was an enjoyable stay and I would go there again, so long as I had a similar room and the nice breakfast room.If you travel to Florence from Pisa airport, forget the train, the journey is horrible, it takes an hour, your lucky if you get a set, and it's heaving with school kids. It takes an hour to complete the journey and it's awful.We returned to the airport via the teravision coach, which only takes 10mins longer, and is a very relaxing experience.

You arrive at Florence train station and once your outside, the Ambasciatori is litrally just on the door step. Yes its a very busy area- with lots of cars and buses whizzing round, but what do you expect from a hotel thats centrally located.Inside the hotel, you can block out the comotion going on outside. The rooms are clean and spacious. The bathroom had a recently been refurbished. We stayed in the back part of the hotel, overlooking the bus garage - these rooms tend to let in less noise apparently. So for the 4 days there, we heard no noise coming in from the outside. The only annoying noise was the slamming of doors, due to inconsiderate guests and the maids who thought having long chats outside our room every morning of our stay was part of thier job description.

But Great Location GREAT LOCATION, IF YOU DON'T MIND THE BUGS! ALSO BE VERY CAREFUL if you do decide to stay here...We had a very STRANGE incident occur during our stay at this hotel, which combined with the bed bug bites was enough for us to never want to stay at this hotel again. On the last day of our stay, a young man dressed in hotel uniform knocked on our door at around 9 am and asked me if he could check the refrigerator - to see if we'd consumed any of the beverages. I told him we had not, and he insisted on checking - I must check. Reluctantly I let him in, and was quite annoyed because he'd awakened me, and my mother was still asleep on the other bed. He proceeded to open the fridge, look around in it and then stare me up and down as if I was a piece of meat at the market (I was wearing a short sleep shirt) and giving me the creeps before he thanked me and left. He came back a second time, thirty minutes later, and asked if he could count the drinks again, which was really getting annoying and raising my suspicion levels to high alert, He kept staring at me the entire time. When he finally left - thank god!, I got dressed and went downstairs to the concierge demanding to know why this guy was in our room -TWICE! checking if we'd consumed any beverages when I'd already told him we had not! The hotel manager - a lady in her early 30's came down, along with the guy and proceeded to ask him in Italian (which I understand) if he'd asked for permission to enter the room before entering. He said I gave him permission. I told her there's ABSOLUTELY NO REASON for him to come in, especially when he's told there's a person sleeping in the room, just to count the drinks in the fridge, while making me feel VERY UNSAFE - TWICE!! I told them I don't want anyone entering our room, and informed them that most hotels count the drinks AFTER you check out, not while you're still sleeping at 9 am!! And once was certainly MORE THAN ENOUGH!! Besides, check-out was at 12pm! Be careful and ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR GUT FEELING - DON'T LET THEM INTIMIDATE YOU IF YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH SOMETHING - YOU ARE PAYING THEM!!NOW, FOR THE LOCATION.....The location was great, right across the street from the train station. We stayed three nights and had no reservations upon arrival. We just walked in, because it's the first hotel directly across from the train station, and got the only available room -with no A/C for 100 euro, which the concierge said normally runs 150 euro. Whatever.. We didn't mind the A/C problem, although it was quite hot (July). The room had a huge walk-out balcony and faced the bus station, but we loved the price, which was amazing for peak season in Florence! As for the BUGS - I am sure they were bed bugs, because I was covered in bites and got more bites each night, and these weren't mosquito bites! They lasted for days, maybe 10-12 days. You can't beat the location however - just a 8-10 mins walk to the Duomo and the center of it all. AS FOR THE FOOD -- There's a great buffet inside the train station as well as a McDonald's - which I'd never consider as an option back home, however the McDonald's in Europe seem to offer different items on their menu, and their Deluxe Chicken Sandwich was exquisite! It's not available in the U.S. - I was bummed find out upon returning. It's grilled, delicious, filling and a total bargain! Actually even their basic burgers tasted so much better - like real beef! And their ice cream on a cone (cheap!) was a welcome treat in the Tuscan summer heat. The buffet at the train station had an AMAZING VARIETY of food, from fresh healthy salads to a HUGE variety of hot courses, pastries, rolls, croissants, gelatto, you name it! Yum! Very decently priced too - as you know meals can ruin your budget if you're careless. So we were quite thrilled to be seeing Florence for less than 120 euro per day including food! There's also a small grocery store right across the street from the Hotel, to the left of the station where you can grab fruit, veggies, chesse, bread, yogurt, etc. and make your own meal in a hurry. But they are closed on Sundays and close early on Saturday. The buffet place and McDonald's are open till 10 - 11 pm daily if I remember correctly, which is really amazing considering that most European markets close very early. I'd give this place five stars if it wasn't for those damn BUG BITES and that CREEPY, SUSPICIOUS MALE EMPLOYEE INCIDENT.", "Date": "Jan 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR554727605", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "maxthecatstudios"}, {"Content": "The Best Hotel in Florence, Probably We had 3 nights to be spent in Florence.

The first evening we spent overlooking a bus station, on what I assume was the backside of the hotel. There was an issue with the television and we were graciously relocated to another room overlooking the train station and center. We found the hotel to be clean and well appointed. It was fascinating to sit in the window of our room and watch all of the busy people buzzing about beneath us. There was a lovely view from our vantage point, of the duomo and surrounding area. There were not balconies on this hotel at the time of our stay. At least not in either of the rooms we were in. The second evening we made the decision not to join the tour group for dinner and ventured out on or own. The front desk kindly recommended a small trattoria a few blocks away. We made our way there easily, drinking in all of the sights and sounds along the way. The restaurant was fabulously quaint and friendly. They provided us with the most memorable meal of our entire stay in Italy, which spanned the entire country from North to South. The only down side to note, minor though it may be, was a bit of a surprise at checkout with the bill for our minibar. I'll never quite figure out how a few bottles of soda, a snack or two and a cocktail a piece came to ninety six euro. Oh My! From that experience we learned to use the in room bar as little as possible while staying in our other accomodations.

As far as location and convenience, this hotel is hard to beat. Coming off of the train platforms at SM Novela Station, exit to the right and it is directly across the street. The rooms are relatively clean and if your requirement is for a basic room to shower and rest your head at night, the price is right.I liked the proximity of the central station- for catching buses, taking those hop-on, hop-off tour buses, getting a bite to eat at MacDonalds/McCafe when not wanting to sit down in a restaurant, etc. Getting out of town is also a breeze from here. The Duomo is a 15 min stroll away and nice to do in the evening.Consistent with what other guests have reported for this hotel, the attitude of the front desk staff leaves much to be desired- especially when it is busy. Tours seem to book here so you may find the front lobby packed with tourists who are gathering to either check-in, check-out or assemble for a guided tour. Something that I found to be disturbing/discouraging was to see upset guests, at different times of the morning, filling out forms because they were burglarized (while in their rooms!). I wonder if we were OK only because it was screaming hot in Milan in late July when we stayed here and we had the air-conditoner going full blast through the night while the windows and doors were locked tight.Any hotel should be very concerned about the safety and security of their guests.

All I had to do was walk down in steps and enter directly into the hotel. For me it really was a great location and I felt safe at all times.I arrived at 12 noon, 2 hours before the official check-in but was allowed to book straight in and given my room immediately. Although the staff were unhelpful I let it slide as I wanted to get straight to my room and was grateful of the early check in. The hotel staff are all unfriendly and offer very little help if they can get away with it. The staff for me were the worst part of the stay, but more on that later.On first sight the room was absolutely marvellous. A double all to myself with lots of space, clean and tidy throughout and a nice large bathroom. The view from my balcony was spectacular and it was amazing to sit and view the sun rise over the mountains with the Duomo, Bell Tower and Baptistery directly in view.So that is all the good things to say and onto the bad. Firstly, everytime I asked at reception for some kind of help it was given begrudgingly and really none of the staff seem to want to be working at the hotel. Not one of them seems happy in there job. When I enquired how to pre-book tickets for the Uffizi gallery the response was to just go and wait in line. This was obviously not the answer I was looking for and when I explained that if you pre-booked you didn't have to queue, I just got a blank response. I can quite categorically say the hotel staff were the most unhelpful I have every come across in any country. I could go on and on with more examples but I am sure you get the picture. It is also worth noting that everytime you pass the reception it seems someone is complaining about something or other, even when it is empty and has few guests.Now back to the room. After my initial positive reaction on closer inspection there were faults. The mini bar was stocked full of over priced goods but was not switched on. The air conditioning was working but it does not switch anywhere near cool enough and seems to be regulated by the front desk, even if you set it on the lowest. My toilet continued to leak noisily after flushing for hours on end. My shower was not very powerful and problems with the water system meant it flooded with water that did not go down the plug hole. Although the problems were reported, nothing was done for my entire stay.The breakfast was really very sub standard. The coffee machine was out of milk 2 of the 4 days. It uses powdered milk and has to be the worst coffee in Florence. The fruit juice machine over watered and it tasted disgusting. The rest of the continental breakfast was enjoyable and the restaurant staff did there best.The bar was closed every single night of my stay, no doubt due to the lack of people staying at the hotel. However, I would have thought this was a basic service that should have still been available.Finally, my hotel safe stopped working on my last day. I didn't worry too much about this as it only held my passport and 60 Euros. However, on my return after another great day of sightseeing I was stunned to find that 20 Euros was missing out of the wallet. I have absolutely no doubt it was taken by the maid or a member of the hotel staff who had access to my room. I was very disappointed and will write to the hotel group direct as the hotel would have done nothing.To finish things off in style I was told I had took a bottle of water from the mini-bar which was absolutely not the case and it was only after a discussion that I was not charged for it.Any UK or USA visitors will be very, very disappointed if you book into this hotel. The service and standards are not what we are used to. A large hotel with very little to offer the 4* rating is really closer to 2 making it vastly overpriced. Florence offers far better 2* and 3* hotels almost everywhere you look and on checking into this on my return I feel I paid way over the odds.
