{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean, convenient, friendly We stayed for 4 nights at the Stella Maris. We were pleasantly surprised about the hotel. Nice and clean rooms, close to center, Zona Rosa and Condesa, friendly staff and moderately priced.Only downside is, that there is really nothing in terms of restaurants/entertainment around the hotel, but Zona Rosa is only a couple of minutes away.We ate ones at the restaurant, food was okay.Overall, we were very pleased and will definitely stay at the Stella Maris again, when we visit Mexico City next time.", "Date": "Aug 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR460461090", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Marc_B"}, {"Content": "MyMexican Home away from Home! I LOVE this place! I've stayed here 3 times and the staff greets me each time as if I were family. The rooms are clean, comfortable. There is a wonderful park across the street where we have gone several times and have made friends there - dogs as well as people! The restaurant food is wonderful, the staff is courteous and always makes me feel special. I feel so comfortable here and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.", "Date": "Sep 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR854837892", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SuzieQ8733"}, {"Content": "When in Mexico City do as the Mexican business do.. stay at Stella Maris! Stella Maris, located directly across from Sullivan Park, is a neat hotel designed for today's business or leisure traveler to Mexico City. This hotel is close to the Zona Rosa, downtown, and the historic district. The rooms are very spacious, clean and comfortable. It has a wonderful restaurant with a changing menu every day from Paella, to great gourmet seafood and meat dishes at very reasonable prices. Alof of the hotel guests and local business community stop by for a relaxing lunch which usually starts about 1 p.m.Most of the hotel guests are business people and the hotel goes out of its way to make sure the guest is satisfied. The prices are reasonable and will not give you the sticker shock that you get in the Zona Rosa, which is only a few blocks away. If you have to travel anywhere, just grab a cab in front of the hotel. For a few dollars you can go for few miles. This hotel is worth it!", "Date": "Dec 22, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR942672539", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Lancer2005"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel without all the unnecessary frills The Stella Maris hotel in Mexico City, Mexico was a nice place to stay without all the frills of the expensive hotels. Our tour bus was able to drop us off and pick us up each day right in front of the door.The lobby was clean, cozy and comfortable. No gift shop or convienence shop but there was one with ATM within walking distance (3 blks) if needed. There was no ATM machine but pesos were available to purchase from the hotel. The hotel has an outdoor poolbar on the roof with an amazing view of the city, mountains and 2 active volcano's. The pool bar was not open as December is not the season but the pool and whirlpool was available for use.There is also a park across the street. The bar/restaurant had very good food in abundance. Fresh fruit, fresh squeezed juices and fresh bread are basics. Service was very good also. Open early but closed approx 9pm which was an inconvienence. There was no entertainment and the evenings after dinner did leave you with not much to do. There is however a restaurant a few blocks away which was open later.The room was basic, no frills but comfortable. There was a television and telephone in the room. Some city noise could be heard but generally was not a problem. 2 bottles of water were provided each day since the hotel water is NOT purified. Nobody in our 60 person group had gotten sick the entire week while there. We did use the bottled water for brushing our teeth and did not use any ice.The delicious coffee and juices were safe to drink.All in all, the hotel stay at the Stella Maris was comfortable and satisfactory. Simple and elegant without being overly fancy. Family friendly. I would stay there again.", "Date": "Dec 17, 2002", "ReviewID": "UR776538567", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "esta bien   showReview(21199440, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR649904370", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "latino692"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d154683-r19450050-Stella_Maris-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "154683", "Price": "$57"}}
