The japenese garden theme is done nicely. There is even a bridge over water with goldfish and a couple of small KOI in it. It is also nicely landscaped. The pool was sparkling and big. It also was 11 feet deep in the deep end. Diving possible! The breakfast was great. They have a Japanese restaurant on site which is very high end and expensive so we did not eat there. However, in the morning they use the same restaurant to serve a complimentary hot buffet breakfast complete with potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, turkey sausage, waffles not to mention all the usual continental breakfast items like toast, cereal, fruit and pastries. Definitely a nice place to eat breakfast with big, oversized leather booths and tablecloths. There is also a nice patio you can eat on. The room was clean but cramped feeling in the closet and bathroom area. The bathroom was definitely the worst aspect of the room. The sink is sandwiched between the toilet and the bathtub/shower. There is a tiny counter area around the sink and an 8\" or so strip of counter behind the toilet. If you have something up there and it falls, guess where it falls into? If you are on the toilet and someone tries to open the door, you get bumped by the door completely. There is no room to spare in this bathroom. And it is a one at a time bathroom as no one can use the sink without interrupting someone showering or on the toilet. I thought there was only 2 towels so I went and got two more from the pleasant desk clerk. Then, while taking a shower, I noticed the towel rack in the shower at the end of the bathtub way up high that had the two missing towels on it. I will have to say, though, that the towels are very thick and BIG. However, they do not have \"pool towels\" so you have to use the same ones. The plumbing gets a \"D\" in this property. The shower head's adjustment was broken so you only had a whimpy stream of water. Also you could not have the water all the way in the shower so water was also coming out of the bathtub spigot at the same time because that pull out knob would not pull out all the way. Also the sink knobs turn in different directions so it makes it confusing to turn the water on and off. The plumbing is loud. We were watching TV and heard a weird high pitched sound. We thought it was the TV but if turns out it was the sound of the pipes through the wall as someone else in another room was probably showering. The beds are full (double sized) which made it a bit tight for 4 people (2 adults and two children) The TV was in a beautiful Armoire and the room had a microwave and fridge. The freeway is right in back of the hotel. We were in an inside facing room so the noise was not too bad but it must be horrible to be on the backside by the freeway though. Since the room was clean, the staff was professional , the breakfast was good and the pool and hot tub were sparkling, this is an acceptable place to stay. However, it is not without its flaws but I really don't think we could have done much better in the area. We once stayed at the Universal Sheraton and that place was not impressive either at double the price of this one.
