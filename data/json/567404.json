I wish I had known about it before. A trip to Paris is an unforgettable, wonderful experience. A trip to the Hotel Antin Saint Georges is unforgettable for completely different reasons. To summarise; this hotel is dirty, dusty, poorly equipped, dangerous and noisy. The location, albeit, is mediocre. Everything else, however, is simply dreadful. You may think as we did; \"well, we are only going to Paris for a few days. It doesn't matter where we stay - we don't intend on spending much time in our room.\" Right? Wrong! Every second in this hotel is a dismal one. Worst of all, perhaps, is the team of staff. They are rude, not slightly interested in helping you and the maid will shout at you at 8:30am and tell you to leave (in a language which was neither French or English). To provide some specific detail; the corridors were almost pitch black. I tripped over the stairs several times. There is no elevator at the Hotel Antin - there isn't light to guide you up the stairs. The hotel room was approximately the size of my shoe. In this hotel room were blackened, burnt walls, a broken mirror (which had been fixed with gaffa tape) and a broken front door and bathroom door. Nothing makes you feel safer. The only redeeming quality of this terrible hotel is that it is located directly above one of the main metro lines in Paris. This may appear to be a wonderful thing when you are concerned about getting around. Do not be fooled! The train going past every fifteen mintues is not a Godsend. It is not a convenience. At two, three and four in the morning it is anything but a convenience. The breakfast did not appear to exist. Seriously...a bowl of cornflakes? Is this the kind of breakfast you would expect? No, I think not. I am very much looking forward to returning to Paris. But mark my words - I will not be returning to this hotel. Stay away - it is not worth a euro!", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't know where they've got the photos from\u201d", "Author": "Turnipatron", "ReviewID": "UR121651759", "Content": "Stayed here back in July (bit late for a review but at least it is an honest and not heat of the moment one).

There is a Metro station literally 30 seconds walk from the front door. Breakfast was OK, (bread, butter, jam, hot drinks and a bit of cereal) Price considering the general prices of central Paris wasn't too bad, but not good enough to make me stay again! Negatives were that the photos were NOT the same hotel. I genuinely don't know how they have gotten away with that! Regardless we ended up with a room with two beds which meant it was massive, so good thing there, but floor was covered in old blackened chewing gum, bathroom was small, damp and you felt less clean using it! No view whatsoever (literally a view of a wall 20 cm on one side and the pipes and back of the building on another side.

In fact, the bathroom was of a decent size, and about 2 thirds the size of the actual bedroom! All in-room facilities were in decent working order so no complaints there. Bed was comfortable enough with a firm mattress. The hotel includes breakfast for each guest and was satisfactory enough, although there are some great bakeries just a short walk away.

However this Hotel is NOT what it advertises. We booked our room through hotels.com with the intentions of having 1 queen bed and two single beds with a shower. Not only did we not receive those rooms, they don't even have those type of rooms. We were given a room with 2 queen beds. The room was in horrible condition, with stained carpets, dirty walls and a outside view of the pipes. The toilet was on one side of the room with no fan or window and the door would not close properly. On the other side of the room was the shower tub and sink. The tub was very slippery and had no curtain to keep the water from splashing all over the floor. As much as you tried, the water would end up all over the floor. There towels were also in bad condition and worn out. The super mini size TV did not work as well. We were very dissatified with the room, so we talked to the front desk to find a solution. They had none. Their solution was to pay $80 euros more per night and get one queen bed extra room. They did not want to accept their hotels condition and were stating that they didnt think it was all that bad. We ended up talking to their hotel manager the next morning and without much options decided to get 2 smaller rooms for #30 euros more per night. The smaller rooms had one queen bed and were slightly better condtion than the larger room. It did have a shower in it, but was very cramped and had no room to move around. This hotel is not very customer friendly and they dont look to assist you. Even with all these issues they refused to at least comp us for a free breakfast for one day. By the way, dont waste your 10 euros on their lousy breakfast. Much better bakeries just down the street. In regards to noise, on some nights there was so much noise from the local cafes that you could not get any sleep. This went on beyond 2 in the morning. Internet service was just as bad as well. No free internet. You paid 1 euro for each 10 minutes, which would be fine if it actually worked. Looked like the service was on dial up. The only good thing about this hotel is that the metro station is 1 minute from the hotel and that there are lots of markets and cafes nearby. However, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!.

I booked this hotel through a agency website (cant remember whcih one) and from looking at the pictures and descriptions of the rooms the hotel looked very good value for money. The hotel is situated in the north of the city and is a ten minute walk from the Moulin Rouge. As such, it was pretty good in terms of location. Upon arrival the reception appeared presentable and the receptioist was very helpful with our questions. However, things changed quickly when we got into our room. The first room we were allocated was on the first floor overlooking the road. Someone had just finished comking a ciggy in there and it STUNK of stale smoke, really disgusting. The room was tiny, no joke, one of us had to sit on the bed whilst the other was moving around the room. The bathroom was filthy with mould and mildew everywhere (stomach churning in fact), the bed was really lumpy, pillows were not worth having they were so flat and to top it off there was some pub hair left in the bed which suggested the sheets had either not been changed or cleaned properly. The receptionist was helpful and very apologetic and helped us changed rooms. The second room was slightly bigger and cleaner although still not what i was expecting from having looked at the hotel's website. Sleep quality would have been a bit of an issue had a not had a fair bit to drink at the Mouin Rouge that night.

The first room we got was 001 on the ground floor - if they offer you this room say no! It's a \"superior\" room (probably because you could swing a cat in it, having seen the others), but it was appalling. Dingy, with very little lighting. Looking out onto bins. Stuffy. Cracks in the bath. No shower curtain. One plug socket, which I had to unplug the phone to get to. No drawers. Dirty surfaces and net curtains. One curtain hanging off. In between the lift and laundry closet. I had about an hour of sleep that night. I listened to every conversation in reception (in between the metro rattling the floor and the lift going up and down) till about 3am. I finally nodded off and at 5am they started getting the breakfast stuff ready so I listened to crockery and more conversation till 7am when I got up. This wouldn't have been as bad had I shut the window, but then I'd have suffocated. Rock and a hard place, huh? The girl on reception (one of two who were actually pleasant enough to bother saying hello each day) wasn't surprised in the slightest and found us another room instantly. This was a vast improvement in terms of light and noise but I could touch all of the walls from my lying position in bed and it was still dirty. There was once again no air-conditioning and the smell of ammonia in the bathroom was hard to bear. The shower cubicle was blackened with mould in parts and one side wouldn't close. I wouldn't put my bare feet on either the carpet or tiles. The towels were all a bit old and worn and grubby. However the street noise was much reduced and I slept through for the rest of the week. Breakfast was ok for 10 Euros I suppose. The bread was nice, the pastries a little stale and overdone on a couple of occasions. The selection was poor though. If you're looking to fill up on stodge before sight-seeing it's enough, but I couldn't get excited about a bit of baguette and jam. There were only croissants on our last day. The girls serving also didn't clean tables between guests but just put a new place setting down, so often someone else's crumbs and splodges of jam would still be there. This was my 6th time in Paris so I know not to expect the standards that you'd get in, say, a UK Travelodge; but for me the St Georges was a bridge too far. I've previously stayed in 30 Euro youth hostels a little further out but of a much higher standard. St Georges is right by the metro and really handy for all of the centre - but for me, I'd rather spend ten minutes extra on the metro and have a nice, cheap room in a hostel.

After telling me the hotel was full etc I offered them the chance for us to be moved to a better hotel for the same money, as it was not my fault.

I know Paris is expensive for hotel rooms but at almost 100 euros a night I expect the basics - a clean room, a decent shower, and a good night's sleep. The reception has obviously been jazzed up and looks quite inviting, and the hotel is very close to the metro (although the nearest metro stop is on line 12 which isn't the most convenient line for many touristy things). However the problems started upon entering the room... Despite requesting a non-smoking room (and I believe the hotel being non-smoking?) someone had obviously been recently smoking in this room, as it stank so bad it gave me a cough after two nights sleeping there (the hotel was full so no alternative rooms were available). There were cigarette butts in the flower box in the window too which also was delightful. The bedside shelf looked like it had been used to stub out cigarettes too. The bathroom was in a hideous old-fashioned pink shade which last was fashionable in the 1970s, the shower head did not have a wall mounting and there was no shower curtain, so taking a shower involved holding the shower head and usually flooding the floor. The bath had chunks of enamel taken out of it and mould round the grout. My room at least did not have some of the \"views\" you can see in the photos from other reviewers here, it faced onto the street. However the first floor location, poor sound insulation, thin curtains, and the relatively busy uphill road ensured noisy traffic throughout the night, especially from those Parisien Vespa owners who like to drill holes in their exhausts to make their scooters louder. You can probably do better than this in Paris by sleeping on the street.

My room faced the street, so I had to leave the windows open for air since there is no AC. You will not get any sleep. Nothing but loud traffic and people talking/yelling on the street all hours of the night! The floors squeaked and the carpet looked old and never vacummed. And, I would recommend skipping the 10 euro breakfast. Just buy street food and pay a fraction of the cost. Spend your $$$ on eating at bakeries and eat baguettes and simple foods. Avoid the classy, overpriced restaurants cuz if you end up staying at this hotel, you're most likely on a budget!

Very near Saint Georges station in line 12 of Metro which makes it really accessible to everything - just don't attempt to walk to them if you're not really familiar with the streets. From the Eurostar station at Gare du Nord you can take 3 short trains - line 4, line 2 and line 12 and a 2 minute walk. We had no trouble finding it when we got off the Metro station. The staff was pleasant and speaks good English, they are very much willing to be of assistance to us for any weird/ silly queries about Paris. The rooms albeit small are clean, (from day one to the last) the TV was flat screen and mounted (and actually has CNN), the breakfast was a buffet and enough to last you till lunch time. For the price we paid I believe this hotel is a good value for money. Our room was on the first floor and facing the highway and being summer, we had to keep our windows open when we were there (it turned out we had to go back between sight seeing to nap and rest our feet) and the noise from the street made it hard for me to sleep and rest, I can also hear the Metro trains passing 2 floors below which was a bit freaky. Having a glass of wine during dinner helped these so in the end they weren't that big a deal. The shop/supermarket along the same street was very convenient and we bought a 6-pack of bottled water for around 1.63 euros. (it can go up to 2 euros near the sights for 1 bottle) We also bought some fruits and some exquisite cakes on the next street parallel to the hotel and they were cheap and a must for a night cap. You can bring food into your room and even borrow utensils/crockery from the hotel kitchen. (just ask reception and bring it back clean afterwards) The hotel doesn't have it's own restaurant but the area has loads to choose from - even if you get hungry around 10:30 at night like we did and decide to go on a prowl. Some of the cafe's/restos nearby can be a bit pricey so be sure to lookout for something more budget friendly.
