{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The worst we stayed in Our trip to Italy was going great we loved the places we had stayed but when arrived at this hotel,,,,that\u9225\u6a9a another story. When we checked in we got to our room and the mattress, if that is what you want to call it, was thinner then a piece of card board. We had told the hostess at the front that our air conditioner did not work. She responded that she would get someone up there to look at it. When we arrived back that night our room was very hot. I have no problem with that, but the air conditioner was not working still. I went down and told the hostess and told her that it still was not fixed and asked if they could move us. We were told that the hotel was booked up, so we were S.O.L. She also stated that the computer that controlled the air conditioner was down but should be fixed by the morning. We went about our nights stay sweating ourselves silly. (our windows were also bolted shut and we had asked that the maintenance man help us out, this was taken care of on our next day there)The next day we went down stairs and asked what was going on with the air conditioner and the hostess a new one stated that the owners said that the air conditioners were no longer needed and turned them off at the beginning of the week.This is what really made us mad, it was NOT the fact that the air conditioner was turned off, but the out right lie. Would I recommend this place to stay?

Staying in this hotel completely ruined our stay in Florence. Let's start with the room: it smelled so bad we had to leave the window opened for hours. I had requested a triple room and with the extra bed there was no room to move around or space for the suitcases. The bathroom was a disaster: the shower was just a fixture on the wall with no cabinet, and every time we took a shower everything was flooded. The towels were really weird, the quality was like restaurant towels not bathroom towels and we had to use most of them to contain the flooded water from running into the room. The furniture was run down and did not look particularly clean.The breakfast was satisfactory, but the dining room smelled so bad in the morning when we came in that we just wanted to finish our breakfast as fast as possible and get out of there. As far as cleanliness is concerned, there were disgusting spots all over the dining room chairs, which seemed like they haven't been cleaned for ages.The only good thing about this hotel is its location and the friendly ladies at the front desk.", "Date": "Sep 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR630831180", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LoveToTravel1210"}, {"Content": "Quaint Hotel in Florence The De La Pace is in a great location right night next to San Marco and the Gallery Academia.

The reservation confirmation from the hotel acknowledged air conditioned rooms. Our room was not air conditioned and was unbearably hot. We sweat through the night and complained. They promised to fix it and then they didn't. This went on for the next two nights. Same complaint and same response. On checkingout, I asked for an adjustment on my bill. Nope, refused. I continued to discuss this matter with them by phone and they finally agreed to reduce the bill 30% or 211 Euros. I was satisfied with that agreement for the time being. They requested by bank information for wiring the funds. Funds never came and now they will not respond to my emails. Very dissappointing.

The staff were very friendly helping us out with restaurant suggestions and even booking tours for us. Our room was spacious, elegant and above all warm as it was freezing in Florence. They served a great breakfast every morning in their breakfast room decorated with renaissance paintings and art. They have internet and a cool american bar where you can relax with a drink and snacks. The location is perfect. Walking distance to all the main monuments but tucked away in a residential area so noise pollution is not a problem.

Big and grand, medium and ok, small and cramped. 2: The air ventilation was bad in 2 rooms. Our room had a nasty air filter, because I woke up each morning with gray boogers. The other had a LOUD constant noise, that ran 24-7 right above the bed. 3: The breakfast was awful, truly the worst buffet I've seen in Europe, so far. 4: The door locks were tricky, and often needed 10 or more attempts to enter the room. 5: We had cold showers for 2 days because a part was broken in the heating tank and the front desk failed to tell us the problem. Not until after 2 miserable mornings, did we get a real explanation (broke on Jan 1, no repairmen until Jan 2 due to holiday). All they had to say was the truth, and guests would have been more understanding. One good thing about the hotel: The staff was very helpful in recommending restaurants nearby, which was wonderful due to it's somewhat out of the way location. All in all, too many problems and we won't stay here again.", "Date": "Jan 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR493500613", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "UStravelgal"}, {"Content": "One night stay We had one unplanned stay here in September 2007 after another reservation was cancelled.

Cheap flight out to Pisa, coach to Florence (simple, fast and cheap) and 2.5 days wandering around this glorious city.The hotel is clean, welcoming and great value. The included breakfast is basic but at this price grab a quick croissant and a juice and then wander down into town for a decent coffee.The room, although facing the road, had a balcony and a view to the far hills and down the road to the sights of Florence.

My single room, at the back of the hotel, was larger than most European hotels, clean, and comfortable with only a view of other buildings. My friend's double room at the front of the hotel, had a full bath and a lovely balcony with a small table and chairs. Air conditioning worked! The lounge was excellent, with comfortable seating, a piano, computer access, and a bar (although the drinks were spendy). The breakfast was handy, but of poor quality with minimal selections. Since our time in Florence was short, the location of the hotel was perfect, as it allowed us to walk to David, the Dumo, the leather market, and many interesting squares/piazzas with great sidewalk caffes. As a 95 euro per night special, the hotel was more than worthy. Staff was friendly, helpful, and the desk clerks spoke English (not so in the breakfast room, however).", "Date": "Oct 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR304079659", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "judywes"}, {"Content": "Don't bother... We stayed three nights at this hotel on the recommendation of a friend of a friend. Because of this connection, we were offered (by email) the family room instead of the double and offered a preferential rate. When we arrived, we were told that we could only have the family room for 2 nights and would have to change rooms on the third night. When we checked out, they did not want to honour the rate we had been offered and were rude, argumentative, and aggressive to us.The positives were that the hotel was located close to attractions and rooms were of a decent size. However, staff never went out of their way to be friendly or helpful, rooms were noisy, and breakfast was often disorganised and understaffed to deal with the number of guests.There are many hotels in Florence from which to choose.

However, most hotels in Florence are renovated palazzos. The hotel was shabbily furnished, small and rickety. It was located on a busy road, which meant keeping the windows closed all night.
