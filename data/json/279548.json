Weekly wine get togethers at the reception every wednesday4. location, in terms of proximity of public transport (right outside the door)5. Comfi beds6. Well equiped kitchenette7. Very quick to accept the fact that they lost my jacket in laundary and reimbursed me for a new one8. Good places to eat in the surrounding areasThe things that could have been better1. Rooms (single) small and narrow. Would have been better if the room could have been more wider and larger2. Gym was really under equipped and small. Just one elliptical, 2 cycles and 2 other machines. For a long stay a good gym is really essentail", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR681892821", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "dum_chick_dum_dum"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d279548-r18429351-Appartements_Johann_Wolfgang-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "279548", "Price": "$163"}}
