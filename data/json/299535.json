I called the front desk to request another room, they offered just to clean the bathroom again, but I pushed for a renovated, new room like others on here had mentioned. Instead, I just got the same old room, three floors up. Come check out-- waited 25 minutes in line-- several customers from the same party took the attention of two staff.

The only thing I was looking forward to was that it was a few steps a way from the MTR station, and that the Airport bus stops directly across the hotel. TO BE VERY TRUTHFUL: a) The MTR station is NOT just a few steps away - yes its nearby BUT its quite a number of steps away. The most appropriate terms is A FEW METERS AWAY. b) The Airport bus does not exactly stop ACROSS the hotel. There's a BUS STOP at the pier which is across the hotel. There are barriers that hinders you fast access to the hotel. You'd need to lug around your baggage through the bus stop and cross the street's pedestrian lane and walk a few more minutes to get to the hotel. CHECK-IN - The check in went smoothly for me, because I emailed them ahead of time that I needed a room to rest in as I am pregnant. When we got to the hotel, surprisingly - there were 3 rooms that were available. So we were all given an early check-in. STAFF - They're just OK. They're helpful but not in a sense that they will go out of their way to help you. The night that we arrived, I asked for extra pillows (I asked for 3) and the Front Desk person even asked me 'Why do you need so much?' which shocked me! Another time, I asked the front desk for the number of Yung Kee restaurant in Central because we wanted to eat there, I was asking nicely if that particular staff can make the reservation for me and she replied with 'HERE'S THE NUMBER, USE THE HOTEL PHONE TO CALL THEM, PLEASE DIAL 9' WTF?! ROOM - The room we got had a Harbour View. I was expecting a smaller room, but what we got was just alright - for Asians that is. If you were a Caucasian, I'm sure you'd complain on the space because it can be quite crowded. There was no where to place your luggage except for the floor. And when you peep under the bed - it's quite a mess because it will seem like your housekeeper will just sweep all the dust and rubbish under your bed! The bathroom is quite small too! Since I was pregnant, I was having a hard time moving around the shower. BED - The bed was so hard! I couldn't sleep well the whole trip! I had to toss and turn and change positions every so often. Since I am pregnant, I couldn't find a comfortable position. I dreaded going to sleep at night! Had I not been pregnant, I guess - the bed would be okay. LOCATION - The location is I guess just alright. There's an MTR station a few meters away. The walk to the trains was quite long too! I was expecting it to be near, but you need to walk meters to get to the ticket booth and another few meters to get to the trains. Its not as near as you would think and expect. There are a LOT of food choices nearby if you are not the picky type. There are congee places and a ramen house near the hotel. There's a small Wellcome around the corner that closes at 10pm. BREAKFAST - Breakfast was okay, I found it good enough. They serve bacon, potato wedges, scrambled eggs, ham, hardboiled eggs. Salad greens, breads with butter and jam. Fruits and orange juice. Cereal and milk with coffee and tea. They also have congee! If you want variety, you can try going to the restaurant nearby for a local fare. My only complaint really is the BED.

Your are a bit further along Hong Kong islands from popular central and main causeway bay areas. However, it is very accessible from North Point MTR station. From the station it is worth taking your time to follow the signs and use exit \"A1\" from the station - from this exit the hotel is only 20/30meters down the road turning right. [If you are pulling luggage, exit A1 has some stairs up and down between it and the main station concourse, so you might want to take a lift to the surface and then make your way across a block or so.] The hotel is generally fine, although it only has two lifts. Becasue the reception is also a couple of floors up from the ground, you can spend sometime waiting for a lift as they shuttle people up and down from receiption. Personally I think the hotel would be wise to try and fit a small mini-lift into the open space to take people up and down from the main entrance to reception, freeing up the two main lifts. Or alternativly lock one off so it always prioritises the bedroom floors, and another to prioritise the shuttle up and down from reception.

We stayed for a week in June (1st to 7th) with my son (7 yrs old). Cons (first): Rooms are a difficult squeeze. No space below bed to slide in bags (must increase floor to bed bottom clearance). Rooms extremely small. Corridors ridiculously narrow (< 4 ft.). You'd think that a city like HK would have standards for minimum width (considering evacuation during emergency purposes). The sprinklers, fire/smoke detectors and alarms would only serve to alert/wet people. Evac is the key to safety. The air-con thermostat doesnt work (Room 1703). TV channels (free) are sparingly provided. But given the room size, not an issue. cant stay in and watch TV except prior to nap time. Pros: That aside, the front desk staff are all right. Not too welcoming. But not too cold either. The major plus is the bus terminal right across from the hotel. A-11 from the airport drops you at the terminal at HK $40 (adult) / HK $20 (child). Real cheap when you consider train + taxi option (> HK $250). North Point to Central MTR is about $6 (adult) / $3 (child) which is nearly the same even if you were to stay in other areas in HK. This side of the island is less crowded and you can breathe. Eat-outs are less, but you have two Wellcome Dept Stores, 7 Elevens, McD and a bunch of chinese shops. Manageable. Area is also quite safe. Although post 10 pm, all shops/joints tend to close-out quick and the area empties itself. Try to book before 2/3 weeks and the rates are THE BEST/LOWEST in HK.

The hotel is very easy to get to from the airport (HKG) by taking the A11 CityFlyer bus for $40 HKD and getting off at the last stop (#21) and then walking across the Ferry Terminal parking lot to the hotel. I could also have gotten on the Airport Express Train for $100 HKD to the Central Station and then a taxi or the Metro (North Point station, exit A1, Java Road) to the hotel. The hotel lobby is actually on the second floor (the ground floor has nothing). The hotel is small with 31 floors and only 2 incredibly slow elevators. I paid extra and got a room with a view of the harbor which, from an upper floor, is really amazing as the window was large and there are were no buildings to block the view. The hotel is a good value for the money in a city where everything is incredibly expensive. I had a double room and the room is so small the bed was pushed up against one wall - acceptable for a single traveler but it could be a problem for 2+. The bathroom was obviously very small with weak water pressure in the shower. The room had only hardwood floors, great blackout curtains, a small Samsung flat screen TV, desk, chair, full length mirror, safe, refrigerator, hairdryer, tea kettle and comfortable bed with mushy pillows. I did hear the people in the neighboring room talking and doors slamming in the hallways so it was not as quiet as I would have liked. There was breakfast available but it wasn't included in my room rate so I can't comment on the quality. The hotel does allow smoking on some floors so be sure to check the \"non-smoking\" option when making your reservation if that's important.

Rooms are typical Ibis - clean, modern and functional. Yes, the rooms are on the small side, but if you're expecting to find capacious, palacial rooms for this sort of price, then Hong Kong isn't the city for you! It's worth paying the little bit extra for a superior room - not only are the rooms slightly larger, but you're also likely to get a harbour view which, if you're on a high-ish floor, is quite stunning (as other reviews have mentioned). The room has a fridge, tea and coffee facilities, and as a single traveller who just wanted somewhere to sleep, shower and shave, it was more than adequate. A lot of reviews make reference to the lifts. Yes, there are only two of them, and they're a bit on the small side, but I never really had a problem with them the whole time I was there, rarely having to wait more than 3-4 minutes for one to arrive. The location of the hotel is a little bit out of the way, but with a MRT station almost next door (turn left out of the hotel and walk for a few metres - entrance is on your left), and the trams stopping nearby, it's pretty easy to get around. In getting from the aiport, I'd recommend the Airport Hotel-link Limousine coach service (especially if you're arriving late at night), as it'll drop you right at the hotel door.

It's only ten mins by metro to causeway bay and central areas. Staff at the hotel Sorrta sucked. The visitor info tour kiosk staff wasn't that knowledgable. Maybe it was a language barrier? Do not do the bus tour the hotel offers as it seemed like it was a tourist trap. It's easy to get to places in hongkong and walking around is great! Staff behind the counter too seemed to not care. At first I thought it was a language thing but we've been traveling now for a few weeks and hit countries with language barriers and never felt of bad staff till we got here. But if you don't care then don't worry. The hotel is 1 min from exit A of north point metro station. To save money, take the bus A11 from the airport to the hotel. It literally drops you in front of the hotel in the bus lot. \u00a0Don't take the mtr from the airport. It's more expensive and be a pain to lug luggage at the mtr station as you would need to transfer. Bus has free wifi and is only 40 hkd.\u00a0 Hongkong has one of those double decker bus tours. We didn't do it as it was expensive and everything in hongkong is easy to find. We bought a day metro pass for 55 hkd each but it didn't include the buses. Only the underground metro. If you do Victoria peak, do not pay extra for the sky terrace. Just take the tram up, and go to the peak gallery building and u can view from the top of that. It's not worth he extra money for the sky tower option. It's a tourist trap. U can walk easily from central station to the entrance of Victoria peak. It was about a ten to fifteen min walk. Or you can take a bus from central station. Be sure to goto the nunnery at diamond hill metro stop. It was fantastic. We also felt the ladies market was by far the better market.

The A/C is another story: the windows don't open, so without A/C it's practically impossible to sleep in that hot/moist environment, and with A/C on, even on minimal power you will need a blanket on you all times because it gets very cold and windy because of the extremely small room. It's very conveniently located 15 meters away from the North Point MTR station on the Island line, you can be downtown in 15min. The personnel is decent and the hotel in general is very clean. They only have two slow elevators, and when servicing a 31 story hotel that could mean a few minutes wait to get up and down. So, it's a good budget choice, the price is the top argument here. You can sleep, hop in the MTR and stay in the center all day without paying 2-3 times more. They have continental breakfast which gets boring really quickly and a limited choices restaurant.

From the airport, we bought an Octopus Card (worth 150HKD) and used it to pay for the A11 bus (fare going to North Point is 40 HKD). W rode the A11 Bus to North Point (Exit is at the right side of the MTR Airport Train from the arrival area), and the last stop was at a bus stop across the hotel. In was a scenic drive that lasted for about an 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the driver's maneuvering skills attest to the fact that when they say 2:25pm, they mean it. :) Cross the street to get to the hotel, past the North Point MTR station entrance. Everybody's quite disciplined and listens attentively to the cow bells, so crossing won't be a problem. Check-in was a breeze. Though nobody helped us bring our bags to the room, it was ok since the elevator was right beside the reception area. It took us 10 minutes for each elevator ride. Wasn't a big deal for us though, as we only had the need to use the elevator twice in a day - when we leave and arrive. We got Room 2610. Though it was really foggy during our stay, the view was spectacular. Yes, the room is quite small, but it gave us ample space to move around. Wifi in the room was good, and they gave me the mattress topper that I requested prior to check-in. The receptionist even confirmed this the moment we arrived. And yeah, the mattress wasn't as hard as I expected it to be (based on the reviews). True that the walls are not sound proof, as I can hear the guests in the other room talking. I even remember one of the guests saying \"hush\" to her companion as the walls were quite thin, so probably that's why we were able to sleep well - as everybody was mindful of everyone else. :) There are no guards in the entrance but we felt pretty safe. Everything is just an arm's stretch away - from the North Point MTR Station to the 711 where you can re-load your Octopus Cards to restaurants that serve local food early in the morning til late night. Felt dismayed though that I wasn't able to eat authentic hand-pulled noodles around the area - probably because of the language barrier. The buffet breakfast was good value for money. Food selection was pretty good for the price. Have breakfast by the window so you can appreciate the harbour while dining. They allow late check outs for a fee; so if paying extra is not an option, you can just leave your luggage with them after you check out. For my next trip in HK, I'll stay in Ibis again.

Service Much as I understand that standard check in time is 2pm. But most places I go to make an attempt to check if the room is available and allow you to check in earlier if the room is available. Regardless of that, at least they did offer guests the options of leaving their luggage behind and coming back later to check in. Service was clearly lacking in some of the staff, or it could have been just a Hongkong thing. I read about the lack of service standards in some reviews but thought it was purely objective until I have experienced it. As the staff who was attending to my check in seems pretty curt, I have attempted to make small talk and asked if there was any international exhibitions going on in HK that weekend. His reply appalled me. His comment was that, HK is always crowded and I should not expect too much out of it. Before I could recover from the unfriendly retort, I was faced with a keycard which does not work. Bear in mind that lifts in this hotel is pretty slow (which is of no fault to the hotel), I have to lug my luggage down to the reception to change the keycard. Once again, another staff changed my keycard with no apology. Surprisingly, it was the housekeeping staff who saw me struggle with the keycard, and she kept apologizing for the inconvenience caused. With my first day of the trip affected, what impressed me most was the GM's prompt reply to my grievances. His service recovery was excellent and definitely something his staff could learn from. 3. Room Basic. No frills. Much as I've read reviews that the mattresses were hard, I've basically slept very soundly for the 3 nights I was there. Harbour view was amazing. Water pressure excellent. Check out was fast and efficient. Pity I did not see the name of the guy, but at least it was friendlier. Took a cab to the HK Airport express station, which costs about 50HKD.

Again, the room was VERY tiny. We had 2 single beds, but there was only about 3 inches in between the two beds. And the single beds are very narrow (about 2/3 the size of a twin bed). Because the room was so tiny, it was difficult to get around even with just two people in the room. We ended up with a room that had a nice view of the North Point ferry pier. The biggest problem with the hotel though were the elevators. There were only 2 elevators for around 25 floors. Several times we had to wait about 5 minutes before one of the elevators would have room to take us up or down. The staff at the hotel were EXTREMELY polite and friendly.

Overall i'd say this is a good hotel for a short break or stopover but maybe not good if you're planning a long stay as i did.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVisit to Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR121766334", "Content": "Very good hotel Room overlooked the harbour which i would recommend Out front door turn left and you are 30 seconds from North Point MTR entrance. only issue is two lifts serving 31 floors serving the reception area, Would stay there again.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taiyuan, China", "Title": "\u201cAfforable harbor view\u201d", "Author": "travellevret", "ReviewID": "UR121700305", "Content": "I chose this hotel because it was about the cheapest option for my dates with the exception of hostels.

I was allocated a twin room on the 30th floor (smoking floor but there was no cigarette smell in my room except the glass ashtray) and it was facing the harbour. The room was meant for two but it was rather small for two persons as there was not much space to walk about with the double bed taking up most of the space. I was staying alone and travelled with small weekend bag and so the size was adequate for me but there would not be sufficient space to open up big luggage, However, it was clean and basic, with safe, hair dryer and refrigerator in it. The shower was good and basic toilet amenities were provided. The bed was alright and there were about 20 TV channels on offer beside the paid movies channel. There were 2 elevators to serve the 31 floors and the wait could be long in peak hours since they were not very fast. The counter staff was courteous and was keen to inform me of their free wi-fi facilities but i did not use it since i did not carry my laptop for the trip. There was a restaurant in the hotel but i did not use it for meals or paid for breakfast service. Overall, the stay was a pleasant one based on the room rate that i paid and the hotel location.

We knew that the rooms were small and we knew that we would have even less space than others as we needed a cot in the room too. They knew this and were quick to bring the cot to our room when we arrived. We actually turned our bed around so that the cot could fit in the room more comfortbly. The cot must have been from the 1980's , it was on wheels and it could not be lowered therefore we had to keep an eye on our toddler everytime he was awake in it as he could easily climb out. The room was modern and refurbished as described but the real disappontment was the view from our window. As it was described as a city view we expected to be able to see the roads down below, instead our view was of a block of flats, which felt like they were just 5 metres across from our window. We could see into these peoples appartents, infact we could see so clearly what was in their rooms. This meant that we had to keep our curtains closed most of the time as they could obviously see straaight into our rooms too. We saw the amazing habour view and if there was one piece of advice it is to book a habour view room, this would certainly help compensate for the room size. We asked if there were any habour view rooms availble but there were not which was a shame. The lifts are increadibly slow. There are only two and once they both passed me on the way up AND on the way down I got so fed up I walked down the steps from the 22nd floor!

Just try opening one case and you'll find there is no space to stand at the foot of the bed, which is terrible. - The area around the bed will even make an infant claustrophibic since there is no room at all and the same can be said for the toilets. - The check in and check out was lengthy since there were just two folks handling travelers checking into a 34 story hotel. There were queues snaking all over the small lobby. - The service wasnt great and most of the staff seemed to be in some kind of pain. No smiles, no goodmornings at all. - While the location is next to an MTR, it isnt so great if you want to shop etc. If so, better to stay in places near Tsim Tsa Shui - TV sucks. No great channels at all. Well there are a few pluses as well: - The location is perfect, just next to the North Point MTR station. Just buy yourself an Octopus card and you can reach any point in HK. - Gorgeous View...needs to be so, since every moment you spend in the room is spend sitting on the bed. - Room rates are among the best in HK.

If you get a harbour-facing room the views are spectacular. In fact, that view was probably the most spectacular I've ever had in a hotel room. The problem with the hotel is inside the rooms and corridors. The room decor was very dated - not just style-wise, but in terms of cleanliness. They had soiled carpets, walls needing repainting, and a pervasive sewagey smell in the rooms and corridors. I asked to change rooms because on my first night the bed had hairs in the sheets, a tiny blood spot, and one insect crawled towards me. Okay, I don't know what that insect was. The reception staff and housekeeping staff were nice and enabled my room change within minutes. The next room felt cleaner but the sewagey smell remained. As well as that, there was a very odd repetitive sound through the air vents at night - sounded like a machine or something. I had to wear ear plugs to sleep. The bathroom was icky, a urine smell which I know is probably ammonia cleaning fluid, but they shouldn't use it. The rooms are really small, with decor and bedding reminiscent of a boarding school circa 1987. There is no wardrobe or adequate storage space. The TV was really tiny, tinier than the average notebook computer. They charge extra for breakfast, and it is really, really not worth the 55HKD. One staff member at breakfast was quite brusque. The food tasted very odd: the bacon, ham, croissants, tasted metallic, the coffee was badly brewed and weak. The yorghut was watery. One morning there was virtually nothing in the trays, until I asked them to refill it - I reckon if you pay for a buffet there should be actual food in the buffet trays. One plus is that the hotel does not take a deposit from you, if you've prepaid your stay there. There was free internet access at the reception lobby computers (if not using them for long). Another plus is that right opposite the hotel is the North Point bus terminus and ferry terminal - from there you can get buses to so many parts of Hong Kong and ferries to Kowloon and another location.

It's also very close to the Java Road Cooked Food Centre, which is great for local eats. The hotel is clean and rooms were well maintained.

No toiletries except hand soap and shower gel (via in-shower dispenser) are provided. The harbour view rooms are nice, but you're so far East on the island that you cannot really see much of the Kowloon/TST skyline. Now to the bad: the bed. It's hard as a rock. I really haven't had a more uncomfortable night of sleep in a hotel. It's as if the mattress were replaced by a box spring. Now, I have traveled the world and stayed in many hotels, inns, and hostels around Asia, and I know that in general beds in Asia are much firmer than in the U.S. But this was beyond firm -- it was hard and uncomfortable. I was actually sore after my night's attempt at rest, and one point in the middle of the night I considered sleeping on the (hardwood) floor instead. If Ibis could upgrade the mattresses, or provide even a pillow top (heck, even make it optional!) to improve the very hard beds, this would shoot to near the top of my list for inexpensive, transit-friendly accommodations in HK.

Since I was aware there aren't too much comfort to offer (toiletries, slippers etc.), I took note the things I needed to buy and provide for the trip. The lift was alright. Though one would wait for a while to bring you to your room floor. The positive side is that the hotel is very much close to the MTR Northpoint Station exit A for Java Road. If one prefers to take a ferry there's Northpoint Ferry Station across the hotel going to Kowloon. And Java Road Market is very near as well. The Front Desk was helpful and tried their best to give assistance. Ibis Northpoint should take note of the guests' requests. I specifically called for an extra towel and advised Housekeeping for one. They forgot my request. I waited for it but I had to forego. Because of this, the next time I advised the Front desk, i made sure to remind them again of my other room service needs. You have to be persistent in telling them what you want. Bed was yes hard but I expected it. I found that there's another pillow placed at the very top of the cabinet which is difficult to reach and get for a small person. The city view of the hotel was interesting. Since I got an email, they said my room is only good for city view and when i looked at the window its the side bldg. of the hotel and thats for them the city view. Misleading. Overall it was an experience and if given a chance, i can still recommend this to other of my friends who are looking for alternatives and prefer to stay far from the city.

The bed was against one wall and this left a walkway along the foot end and side of the bed, which would be even smaller if bags are placed there. However there was a good sized desk and a safe, both of which we piled stuff on for storage. We did not find the size of the room to be a problem. The main problem for us was the size of the \"double\" bed. I would say it was more like a single-and-a-half bed, and myself and my partner struggled to sleep comfortably (or at all!) there. I would recommend opting for twin beds if this is possible. The room was spotless but the bedspread/blanket combo and the curtains were a bit dated. I suspect that we were given a non-remodelled room, but I am not sure why or how the remodelled rooms are given out. Overall I felt that this hotel has seen better days, but I suspect that had we stayed in a remodelled room I would have been more enthusiastic. I had no issue with the room size, but the bed size was an issue for us and for that reason I doubt we would return to this hotel.

I had originally booked a \"Classic Room\" with a \"City View\". Basically, this type of room is a dark, dirty (stains on the curtains, carpets, dirty marks all over the walls and the bathroom was black with mould), grey prison cell and the view was the tower block behind the hotel. See my photos attached. As soon as I opened the door to the room I went back downstairs to the reception to change rooms immediately. We paid extra to have a \"Superior Room\" with a harbour view. If you are going to stay in this hotel please spend the extra money to book the \u201cSuperior Room\u201d with harbour view, as you WILL feel better during your stay. The \"Superior Room\" is exactly the same as the prison cell in size expect there is laminated wood flooring, a flat screen TV on the wall and the cupboard doors have been changed. The bathroom had a new lick of paint too but is still tiny. I must admit that the Harbour view is impressive. However, the hard as rock bed was still the same. Certain rooms, on higher floors, have obviously been refurbished and hence have the \"Superior Room\" status. The rooms are not soundproofed in any way. We could here people getting in and out of the lift, mobile phones ringing in other rooms, people using the bathroom and talking in other rooms. We were on the 19th floor and could here the traffic going by as well. The hotel has 31 floors and just 2 very slow lifts. After a couple of days, waiting for the lift all the time became very irritating. We didn\u2019t have dinner in the hotel however, there didn\u2019t seem to be a large choice on the menu nor was it very international. The breakfast buffet was well stocked but NOT very appetizing. The plus points of the hotel are that the staff are friendly and eager to help. The hotel is just next door to a metro line that takes you directly to the centre of Hong Kong and opposite a ferry that will take you across the bay to Hum Hong. The harbour view from the Superior rooms is fantastic.

And if you walk to the left of the hotel, cross the road and then turn left, you will find a local bakery shop. It's egg tart was to die for!!!!

So while i knew the city well, when it came to choosing a hotel, I wanted one that was centrally located yet comfortable. Not a fancy place but a clean bed and breakfast hotel. I knew that most of the day we would be out yet wanted the hotel to be close enough to head back and rest a while at mid day before getting out once again at sun down. After a search on the net for hotels in Hong Kong we decided we would stick to an international chain of hotels. Today most international hotel chains cater to the budget traveler. A traveler who wants a certain standard yet knows its not going to cost an arm and a leg. We chose the Accor Group of Hotels. Then decided on the budget chain IBIS. The Ibis in North Point is very well located. It's just a few steps away from the MTR ( Mass transit Railway) and in the city's circumference. So if you decide to hit the night spot Lan Kwai Fong and lose track of time, then getting a cab back in the wee hours of the morning is only a short drive back to your hotel. The hotel over looks the bay and rooms facing the bay cost extra but waking up and seeing the harbour across is well worth it. Between the harbour and the hotel is the city bus terminus. My husband is not a bus guy and at first refused to take the double decker bus from North Point to Stanley Market. But when i insisted he agreed. At the end of the journey he gave me a hug saying that this was the only time he was happy to listen to my advice. The scenes from the top of the bus of the harbour as the bus took the meandering hilly route was absolutely breathtaking. And since the bus starts from North Point, choosing your window seat is never a problem. The best part about staying at North Point was that we could always head back to the hotel if we got tired shopping. The hotel provides Tea and coffee in the room so you can always count on that to revive you from your tiring shopping escapades. In fact on the last day we tried the Massage center located in the Lobby of the Hotel and found it to be well worth the price. The hotel Lobby has Vending machines that offer you sodas, juice and candy bars. And if you need more that what the machine offers, there is a Seven Eleven just outside the Hotel. The area outside the hotel has a range of Chinese restaurants and even a local street bazaar. One morning we wanted to get a head start to our sightseeing so decided to head out early. We were happy to find a chines bakery selling all kinds of Breakfast buns just on the turn to the main road. The rooms are small and compact. But it has an ensuite bathroom and great for those who want to spend more time discovering the city and less time in the room. The coffee shop in the hotel serves a decent breakfast with a choice of western and traditional Chinese fare. If you are not adventurous with food then you can be sure you will find Eggs, toast, jam butter croissants and coffee and tea. Whats more the price is perfect. Its in fact what i would call a bargain especially if you avail of the special offers they have from time to time.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cNICE LOCATION.

Location is great, 1 minute walk to bus station and North Point mtr station. 2. Price is good, HKD3540 for 8 days (but we found out that we would rather pay more for any flea free hotels after staying) 2. Bed is extremely hard but acceptable for me, but could not sleep everyday after 9ish as hotel is under renovation. Noise level is unacceptable given that it starts at 9:30am, was advised nothing that they can do since all floors have the same noise level. 3. 2 lifts sharing 30 floors, my average waiting time was 4 minutes. 4. I knew HK is a place where small rooms are common, but those curtains and carpets with stains really need to be cleaned/replaced, they made me feeling like living in a very disgusting place. 5. bed was tidy but found hair on it, they may not replace sheet even traveller checks out. 6. on our 8 days stay, we had around 30 flea bites on day 3, with no apologies or what so ever, we were allowed to have another room after complaint. After chatting with a cleaner i was advised to turn on A/C on the time to calm the fleas otherwise they are very active (turned off A/C due to point 6) 7. (both) room temperature knob is not working, temperature remained the same on either 16 or 30 degrees. Fan speed can be adjusted though. 8. i was confused on the star rating on ibis north point (4 star from tripadvisor and 3 star from booking.com) but according to international hotel star classification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(classification)#Hotel_ratings) this hotel is 2 star due to a few missing facilities. 9. asked if we can take our luggage (4 pcs) to the bus stop across the road with the hotel luggage trolley but was refused and advised that luggage trolley only as far as to the front door. 10. they had archived their \"15 minutes\" service promise when i asked for extra pillow and some spoons though.

The breakfast was very inconsistent - some mornings there would be bacon rashers, other mornings none. Sometimes there would be brown and white bread for toast, other mornings just one or the other, etc. Quite a selection of Chinese-style options, of course, but no Western-style tea, just coffee or orange juice, or tap water. The hot breakfast was bacon (some mornings), small salami-style sausages, lovely scrambled egg (in abundance), potato wedges and fried skinless chicken pieces. No fruit at all or yoghurt which disappointed me in the beginning, however there was a small fridge for use in my room but I found that yoghurt which I bought went off very quickly in it. No room service either which was disappointing after a long flight but the restaurant operates during the day, I didn't try it but the menus looked nice each day and great value, about $30 for a mains and it always sounded busy. The district is full of local restaurants though, a couple had English menus, and there are corner shops and the MTR and tram stops are very near to the hotel which is a huge plus! There is wireless internet available in your room, if you have a laptop, but the cards which had to be purchased at reception cost HK$40 for 3 hours or I believe $300 for 24hrs, and these timings had to be used up all at once, could not be spread out over several days. The rooms are tiny compared to even basic Western standards and there was no wardrobe, just a few hangers in a hole in the wall above the safe. The carpet is old, there were significant pieces of missing ''wall'' or skirting board in my room and the bathroom. The bathroom was old but fine and the towels had a slight smell of disinfectant each day. The TV had several English-language channels, including a few local ones and France24, Fashion TV... Also some in French and German, but mainly Chinese of course and it was great to be able to come in after the day and catch up on some English-language news. I was a solo female staying at the hotel and one of the (male) room attendants seemed to take a shine to me, I mean he was very nice but when he would meet me as I was leaving he would frown and ask if I really needed my bed made that day... I just let him away with it each day as it's not something that bugs me too much and I don't believe in washing sheets too often during a hotel stay. It was a purely functional stopover place for me and I would recommend it based on the price, but please remember that HK hotels add on 10% service charge to your total bill.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201cIf you are on a budget-this is the place for you\u201d", "Author": "nairajay10", "ReviewID": "UR63814869", "Content": "Yes this maybe the hotel with the tiniest room in the world but for the price I paid it was good, the bathroom was tiny too but it always had hot water and the view from the room was the wall of the next building there is even a small TV thats fits into the wall (and one english channel) but all this did'nt matter too much as we hardly spent time in the hotel.The best part about the hotel is that it is next door to the north point MRT station so basically no place in Hong Kong is too far away.

The room was adequate for a solo traveler, but would be tight for a couple. Location is fantastic -- MTR North Point station is 50 meters west of the hotel's entrance. The A11 bus to the Airport stops about 100 meters South of the hotel at the NOrth Point Bus Terminal. The North Point ferry terminal is about 200 meters South of the hotel. The Tram stop on Kings Road is two blocks North of the hotel. There's also a McDonalds on Kings Road that you can access from the MTR station. If you need an electrical adapter plug, there's an electronics store just around the corner from the MTR exit on Java Road that sold me one for HK$ 6. Elevators were very slow. Several times I walked down from my 16th Floor room to save time. There was a bit of noise from the several busloads of Chinese tourists that stayed at the Ibis North point, but nothing that should prevent you from sleeping.

The view was quite impressive from the room, I was on the 26th floor and had great views out over causeway bay and across to Kowloon. Travelling alone the size was not much of an issue for one night, but I think more than that and I would have started to feel way too claustrophobic. Hong Kong is a hard place to find personal space in as it is without sleeping in a shoe box. To be fair, the room was very clean (hard surface floors ensure carpet cleanliness is no issue) and rates on the internet are quite reasonable for any bed in Hong Kong. Just don't try to fit more than one person to a room. There is space for a double bed, a shower and a toilet, and if you're lucky, you might find a tiny slither of space to stow one medium sized suitcase.

The furnishing is basic, they provide an electronic safe, refrigerator, electric kettle and cable TV (mainly Chinese channels though). The bed was rock hard and on wheels for some reason, so everytime I turned the bed would roll a few inches. The toilet is clean but tiny. Try not to get an erection in the shower, there just isn't enough space. Tips: take your own drinking water & toiletries They have a \"restaurant\" on the second floor, but I would reccomend trying the restaurants near the hotel, they're cheap and clean if you don't mind the local food. There are also two 7-11's nearby. All in all, it's definitely worth it if you want to stay on the island. However, there are far bette places in Kowloon or Mongkok if you don't mind the distance.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walnut, CA", "Title": "\u201cNot great but not horrible either.\u201d", "Author": "UnclePaulie", "ReviewID": "UR48771165", "Content": "My wife and I stayed for four nights at the Ibis North Point.

They're very good at putting down the phone when speaking to hotel guests, that's what I noticed. Well it doesn't end there...I went downstairs for the calculator and was 'welcomed' by the front desk person who seems very unhappy to see me (starting to wonder why he got in the hospitality industry in the first place if he hates seeing and interacting with people). I went on to borrow the calculator from the front desk officer (KENNETH WONG) and stayed there for a couple of minutes only to see him heavily put down the phone (bang is better word) and curse after speaking with guests on the phone. I was both appalled and shocked by this behavior which I didn't expect from an employee of such a huge hotel chain. I'm from Manila and I've been to a number of hotels in my country and outside of my country, but it's the very first time I got this kind of service...very disappointing indeed.

One socket was located in the sliver of a doorway where the bathroom is, and above is an open closet area. Too bad there was no room to put the portable boiler so she stuffed it in the small closet area, where wonderfully, the cable too long and hanging, and I commenced to come out of the bathroom, trip over the cord, resulting in hot boiling water pouring down both legs.

After wasting time where my burns could have been salvaged as 2nd degree burns, they became third degree burns (joy). The ambulance came and as I was going down, strapped onto a bed, with two dudes hauling me, some worker from the hotel decided now would be a good time to ask if I was alright. DO I LOOK ALRIGHT? TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH, JACK[--]! I didn't mean for this rant to go as far as it did, but it's necessary.

The tram is not far away, but it's slow to get anywhere... best to get the Octopus card from the MTR subway, which operates like 6 AM to 1 AM. The internet in the lobby was reasonable.

The location is very convenient for moving around, especially if you have 3 days octopus card, giving you unlimited rides on MTR and a return trip from/to airport. There was no queue at the 2nd floor reception during checkin, perhaps due to my late arrival. I got the room on 21st floor. It was a non-smoking floor, but seems some indian neighbours didn't care about that, as they kept on walking around with cigarettes, and filling the ashtray in front of the elevator. The elevator wait was a long one though, sometimes up to 5 minutes. There are 2 lifts, but they seemed to be stopping nearly every floor... and with 30+ floors, that takes quite some time. The room was tiny and as many others say, unless you put your stuff under the bed, you have nowhere to walk. It is functional though, despite being far from tidy. Dust was everywhere, on clothes hangers, safe, hairdryer, \"desk\", ... The towels in the bathroom were full of long black hair, the \"shower gel & shampoo\" on the wall empty, as was the fridge. Maybe I am accustomized to Sofitel, but usually you get at least a bottle of water in the fridge, not so here. Good there's 7-eleven 50m to the left, so you should expect to go there first thing after unpacking (likely before the shower). As others mentioned, carpet wasn't clean, it was full of stains, but not in my room, mostly on corridor. Staff attendance was on par with general generosity of Hongki people - there wasn't much of it. Still I wouldn't complain over bad service. And the restaurant... I didn't really expect a russian canteen style (or ok, if you don't know what it means, think of a prison) wooden benches and tables with a 5 options, all including toast-it-yourself bread, dry croissants and a choice of fried or scrambled eggs. I hated the potato croquettes and measly salad they included, but the chicken steak was actually quite tasty. Oh, forgot, there's also a choice of drinks (coffee, tea, water, orange juice) and jam, butter. All in all, I am wondering if I'd stay there again. Yes, location is marvelous, especially if on Octopus card and there for 3 days, as it's right next to the MTR and one big double decker bus station as well as a ferry port, the view out the window is magnificent, overlooking the harbour to Kowloon with some cruiser ships always there (too bad the airport moved, else you could look at the planes taking off also... ok, maybe not so good cause of the noise), but the size makes it practical only for one person, and that's for a person that's not very fussy about tidiness, which I am. You mentioned internet... one day and hourly fees are truly a rip off, but they also have a 7 days card, which I was using (costs same as good 2 days), which I gave my neighbour when I was leaving. Prices were on par with other hotels I was staying in across asia pacific.

We really returned to the hotel late night and to have a place to sleep: Ibis North Point was an excellent choice.", "Date": "May 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taunton", "Title": "\u201cWorth it for the views\u201d", "Author": "Momoi", "ReviewID": "UR7476855", "Content": "We were very worried about this hotel after reading all the reviews. At check in the staff were very polite, the first room we were allocated was grim. But after a very brief conversation with the receptionist we were allocated a room on the 28th floor a non smoking floor - the decor was acceptable, the sheets on the bed were clean and nice fluffy towels in the bathroom, and a decent shower which always worked and always had hot water of a consistent temperature. Yes the bedooms are small - but if you move the bed against the wall for day time mode and out again at night it works really well. The room is a typical HK budget room, small but perfectly formed. The harbour view was probably the best we have ever had in HK , we have stayed tin HK four times at different hotels. Should you be sad enough to be in your room at 8 o'clock at night you can see the light show!!!! Breakfast in the hotel is a real bargain at only 35 dollars for an american breakfast. The bus station is just outside where you can catch a bus to almost anywhere on the island. The Airport bus leaves from the bus station at regular intervals and at a bargain price will whisk you to the airport in 50 minutes (the receptionist will tell you it takes 2 hrs but dont believe her). The MTR station is just 100 metres away and if you invest in an Octopus card you can get around HK really easily. There is little storage space in the hotel room but this is normal for HK so be prepared to live out of your suitcase but it is worth the experience!!! This is a budget hotel but worth giving it a go. How long do you want to stay in you room. You will find that once in HK your room will only be a place to sleep.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles Ca.", "Title": "\u201cReceptionist Ms Bird is the best\u201d", "Author": "Farangdingdong", "ReviewID": "UR7289192", "Content": "The staff are unsmiling but efficient except for Ms Bird who remembers your name and is verry efficient but a little too businesslike and not chatty.The rooms are tiny(not much bigger than the bed)The bathroom has great water pressure in the shower.The double beds are hard.If you can find out where they hid the electric kettle it is nice to not need room service to make a drink of tea or coffee.The phone rings off the hook when you need assistance from your room.The airport bus(A11/12 $65hk r/t)stops outside.It is next to the underground train station which is on the Wan Chai line.Try the restaurant on the second floor! The restaurant has very friendly and attentive service. However even though you could stay in the best hotels in Los Angeles(with a discount) for less than than the cost of the Ibis, You would not get the spectacular unobstructed harbour view from your room and that is what makes this hotel a great deal for the price in Hong Kong.Alexander Williams, Los Angeles Ca.USA", "Date": "April 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairns", "Title": "\u201cGood for the prices of Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "ScottRo", "ReviewID": "UR7259227", "Content": "For anyone that has ever stayed in an Ibis hotel before - this one is no different.

Alight at the North Point station of the Island Line. Follow the signs to Java Road. You will have to carry your luggage up two flights of stairs at the end. Once out on Java road, turn right.

I explained since i was there, it's easier for them to accommodate my request while they can have a twin room to sell for double occupancy. It took so much effort and skills for the rude manager to reluctantly offer me a double bed room. I was also surprised that guest has to pay a deposit to enjoy the room telephone service!!!

Not recommendable for most Europeans & Americans. The hotel is in an older residential area.

There was no extra supplies in the bathroom besides liquid soap. Even the bathmat was miniature. I actually found this hilarious. I had a non-smoking room - but the carpets were pretty run-down.
