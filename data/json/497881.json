I will also try out 3 new hotels in Venice because I'm using points and I like to experience different areas. My husband and I spent 6 nights at Ca' d'Oro last summer. We requested, and paid extra for a canal view room. Very worth it, in my opinion. Like most Venice hotels the basic rooms are small and the walls are thin. But the staff was all friendly and helpful. The breakfast included cheese and meat slices. I need protein in the morning so this was great for me. You use a coffee machine for your espresso and I was suprised that it is quite decent. There is a rooftop terrace that can be tricky to get to if you're not on the right floor/staircase, but we went up there everyday. One evening we bought bread, meat, cheese, fruit from the nearby COOP opened a bottle of Amarone we bought at a shop near the Rialto and ate up there. Lovely! This hotel is in a quiet location but still near everything. If you want to get to the fish market without fighting crowds at the Rialto just walk 2 minutes to the traghetto at Campo Santa Sofia. (last August this cost 1 euro for 2 people) A super cheap, short gondola ride directly to the fish and fruit market! Also, it takes about 5-7 minutes to walk from the Alilaguna stop on Fondamenta Nuove. It takes longer to get back there since the departing dock is on the other side of a rather large bridge. But, in total, I remember just 3 bridges to cart my luggage over!

Good feed back on Web sites. What can we say, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gem, tucked away in a nice quite back street, yet only 5min walk to Rialto Bridge, and 10-15min walk to St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square. Loads of local restaurants to hand, wine shops and small markets. Also just at the end of the road is a main shopping street, with a supermarket, so you can go buy a local, bottle of coke, crisp, snacks, beer, whatever you need. Yes for those that need it, there is also a McDonalds. This hotel is fairly small, but well turned out, decor is good; room size for us was fine. Nice clean modern bathroom. TV if you have time to watch it, ok to catch up on the world news at the end of a long day sightseeing. No kettle, but we always take are own travel kettle for that fist cup of coffee in the mornings. Oh nearly forgot, yes you do get free Wifi, unlike many other hotels near by. Getting to the hotel from the airport was real simple; we could not have planned it better, from Marco Polo airport. Get it wrong and you could spend half a day on a coach, train, then boat then, walk. Private water taxis are very costly, even shared. We Pre booked a return ticket on line with Alilaguna lines web site, 24 Euro. You just walk out of the airport follow the signs to the dock, get on your transfer to Venice, you need to get off on the second stop, F.Te.Nove. From this top its 10 min walk to the Hotel, Warning you do have go over a couple of small bridges, with steps, so you need to be fairly fit if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re carrying a suitcase. You then just follow the simple instruction we downloaded from the hotel web site, it took us 10min at the most. Real simple to find. Check was straight forward. Continental breakfast. Small area at the rear of the hotel behind the check in. Cheese, ham, croissants, juice, coffee, tea, toast, cakes, cereal, no real issue with any of it and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the room price, unlike many other large more expensive hotels. Another nice find is small roof terrace, it is small, but it gives you one heck of view over the roof tops, and you can sit and have a beer of coffee, you have to supply it yourself. We could not fault the service or the Hotel on our trip, 4 nights. Just remember you do have to pay for the Tourist Tax on check out. The return trip to the airport was also simple; 10min walk down the road over 2 bridges and get on the boat back to the airport. The Airport is fairly small and we returned on a bank holiday, so it was packed out, check in was fine, but there was massive big queue to go through security, so good job we got there in plenty of time as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure loads missed there flights home due to queues at security.

It has a good feel as people actually live and work here. There is a Co op supermarket just round the corner which is good to buy water and bits and pieces. Although we didn't have canal view rooms, it didn't matter as we weren't in the rooms that much. The view from the little terrace on the 4th floor was beautiful, with the snow capped Dolomites in the distance. The rooms were small, but well decorated and beautifully clean. The bathrooms were modern and clean, some on the small side, but that's to be expected. We arrived at Fontamente Nove and following the directions on the hotel site, it was really easy to find and took only about 5 minutes. It's also easy to get to from the Ca d'Oro vaporetto stop. The area has several good local restaurants. Tthe best we found was Osteria La Bottega ai Promessi Sposi in Calle dell' Oca, a small alley a couple of minutes from the hotel.

We are both in our mid twenties and have reasonable expectations. FINDING THE HOTEL The hotel was easy to get in the vicinity of if you follow the instructions on the hotel's website. Be warned that the hotel is a door at the end of a fondament, just a few yards along from a restaurant. In fact, the bloke I saw eating his lunch at a table was the hotel manager who had been expecting us. OUR STAY My wife and I stayed there on honeymoon for 3 nights, having also been to Florence and Rome. The manager gave us the keys to the front door and our room and let us come and go as we pleased, which we liked because we wanted to get out and see and enjoy as much of Venice as we could. I tried to speak as much Italian as I could, which was basic to conversational at best. THE HOTEL STAFF The manager brought us breakfast on a trolley each morning at a time we specified, which was a nice touch. We were given a map by the hotel manager and given excellent advice, which is that there is no accurate and comprehensive map of Venice so just use your sense of direction. Venice is full of couples furiously prodding their maps and arguing. My wife had a eye witness travel book of Italy and we used that to get around Venice in conjunction with our map (please note that you will get lost at some point but embrace it, you're on holiday in an amazing place). Regardless of the time of day someone was at the desk. THE ROOM The room was a reasonable size with a blue thick carpet in it, a small tv, a small safe, a clean and nicely done bathroom, and best of all after walking around Venice; a decent bed. The value of the hotel was very good considering we were in Venice and everything is massively overpriced, although our friend is a travel agent and so we got an excellent deal. LOCATION As stated by other tourists on here the hotel is easy to get to the Ca D'Oro waterbus stop (we arrived in Venice by train from the station and got a waterbus fron there), Rialto Bridge, St Mark's Square and the waterbus stop that takes you directly to Marco Polo airport, which was incredibly convenient. There was an Internet cafe along the fondament with a reasonable hourly rate considering the competition in Venice.

However, it is a good value for the type of hotel that it is though I am far less enthusiastic about it than other reviewers. What I loved about this hotel was it's location in Venice on a canal (one of those things you dream about when you go to Venice) and that it was conveniently located within five minutes walking distance to the Rialto Bridge (without being in the commotion of the Grand Canal). I got up early every morning to walk the neighborhood and experience local life and liked that this hotel was off the beaten path but conveniently located and generally easy to access (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not schlepping luggage). Don't miss a visit to the rooftop of this hotel for fabulous views and photos. Hotel Ca D'Oro has a tiny lobby and small elevator that was very inconvenient for checking in and out as you had to go up to your room one at a time with your luggage (I had a large but not over-sized suitcase and a carry-on and my friend had the same). We had a room that had a view of the canal (if you stuck your head out the window about a foot) and it was located on the alley by the canal. Beware that the locals start unloading boats very early from the canal adjacent to the alley which woke me up every morning around 6:30am (one of the hazards of being near the canal or a busy area). The room was very small but clean (but not very shareable), the bathroom was clean, and the beds were not horrible but not as comfortable as I consistently experience in American hotels. The staff was cordial, but not overly friendly or overly helpful. To be more accurate, it didn't seem to occur to the hotel staff that they were in the hospitality industry. There were no porters and no staff available for hire to assist you with your luggage in any way, which was stressful as we had to schlep our luggage to the water bus terminal about five to six blocks from the hotel (but that included maneuvering over two bridges with staircases). I would have been very happy to pay someone to help us as my friend had disability issues, however the hotel staff could not accommodate any requests of this nature so my advice is to pack light if you're pinching pennies (since water taxis to the airport are close to US$125-150) and it's no fun schlepping suitcases (even on wheels) over two bridges to the water bus station. The breakfast was adequate and very European but I confess, as an American, I was craving eggs and had no success finding an American breakfast offered in the city. Worth a mention: I got several bug bites while in Venice in late October. There were a couple of large mosquitoes in our room that could have been due to the canals. Bring bug spray. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel, but it's fair to know what you're getting. Use the money you save on this hotel for that priceless (but expensive) must do gondola ride. [Tip: Don't book a gondola on the Grand Canal, but book it with a gondolier on one of the small side canals. You'll save about US$30 and get the same ride.]", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cClean, old style, friendly staff, quiet location\u201d", "Author": "LuxuryGirl06", "ReviewID": "UR51923294", "Content": "This tidy Venice hotel is tucked away in some back streets, but the location is very good, not too far from the Rialto Bridge, quiet at night and amongst residential homes.

To end our holiday and to get the easiest flight back home, we decided to go to Venice and booked a one night stay at Ca\u00c2\u00b4D\u00c2\u00b4Oro. We found it to be an excellent choice! Great location as it was in a very quiet area but still easy to reach all attractions, very helpful & friendly staff, nice and clean hotel.

We thougth the windows were closed (which by the way is a bit hassel to get closed) but after calling the reception they could see in their system that our window wasn\u00c2\u00b4t closed. (This hotel is a bit high-tech and has the best security systems I\u00c2\u00b4ve ever seen in this price-range) . The aircon was quite cold so we only had it on for maybe 5-10 minutes before we went to bed and then turned it off. Worked just fine. The room did not get warm afterwards, even in the morning it stayed cool. On top of the roof there\u00c2\u00b4s a small balcony where you have a nice view and can sit and enjoy your espresso in the morning or evening. The breakfast buffet is served until 1030 a.m. and we found it to be very good! The average Italian breakfast consists of cakes only(!) so here we could enjoy croissantes and a more \"continental\" breakfast, so we were very pleased with the selection offered. We did take advantage of the hotels offer on free motorboat ride to the Murano island to the Murano glass factory. We asked in the reception when it could be possible to go there, and 5 minutes after we were picked up by the boat just outside the hotel. At the Murano glass factory I just have to emphasise that you should be very aware that the people working there and taking care of you the minute you arrive is in fact sellers for the factory! That means that the minute you start to show interest for something the person will follow you everywhere and try to make a \"special price for you\", and \"our man\" tried every trick he could think of to get us to buy the things we had looked at. This was really annoying!! There are the most beautiful things made of glass you can imagine, but the prices are way off the roof! So be very careful or else you could end up buying something you really cannot afford. We did buy some very small stuff, like corks made with glass to put on your bottle of wine after it\u00c2\u00b4s opened, it costed 15 Euro each. Afterwards we found the same thing in an other shop in Venice for the price of 5 Euro! So our advice is: DO NOT SHOW MUCH INTEREST ON WHAT YOU SEE THERE AND DON\u00c2\u00b4T BUY ANYTHING THERE!!! You\u00c2\u00b4ll probably find it cheaper other places.. OR: Look in shops (they\u00c2\u00b4re selling Murano glass everywhere in Venice) and if you see anything you really want to buy, then go to Murano glass factory and compare the prices.. Then you\u00c2\u00b4ll at least know if you\u00c2\u00b4ll get ripped off or not). Other than this, loved the stay in Venice and loved the stay at Ca\u00c2\u00b4D\u00c2\u00b4Oro!! Will definately recommend this hotel to others!", "Date": "August 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cThe Ca D'oro\u201d", "Author": "jet_setter1990", "ReviewID": "UR18393484", "Content": "We stayed for a week in the Ca D'oro in the Superior Deluxe Double Room. Room 202, room with the canal view which we requested when booking. The canal which we were overlooking wasnt as exciting and romantic as it sounds. Directly opposite are residential houses where the locals are living. Not really worth the extra 15 euros per night. Breakfast is included in the room rate and it was very nice but there is no variety and there was the same on offer each morning. Croissants, cheese, hams, cornflakes and muesli. Juice and Coffees are available for drinks. The airconditioning was very welcoming during the day but was not able to be controlled within the room. At night the air con couldnt be fully turned off and got wquite cold late at night. Several times i woke up next morning freezing. In the room description of the Superior Deluxe Double Room the bathroom stated to include a bath and a shower, however when we got there, we found just a shower. I didnt complain as I prefer showers but should be noted if a bath is requested. The cleaners came around everyday which was very good. The only problem we had with them was that they just came straight in. We were having an afternoon nap and even put the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, and they still came in. Be warned that cleaners come around at about 1pm everyday and will come in, no matter what. Many times the cleaners also didnt make the bed properly. the location of the hotel however is very good. After arriving at the airport, take the Alilaguna, blu line to fondamente nuove. the ticket will cost 12 euros each but is the cheapest way for getting to venice. a water taxi will cost around 95 euros. From there head right and take the first left. Follow this over two bridges. There is a very handy co-op shop on the right had side which is very reasonably priced. I would definitley recommend buying drinks from there rather than the mini bar in the room. As you walk down that street there is a very nice restaurant with very good service. It is also very reasonably priced and very high quality food. After the co-op turn immediately right and the hotel is at the end of that street on the right. There is a small sign, but is easily missed. It takes around 5 minutes to find the hotel from the fondamente nuove alilaguna stop. If you have never been to venice before, do note that most resaurants have a cover charge of around 2,50 euro and have a service charge of 12%. However this is most often welcomed due to the excellent service and food. I would definitley recommend the lasagne to everyone.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWould be wonderful any other time...\u201d", "Author": "Anonymous707", "ReviewID": "UR16791804", "Content": "I think this hotel would be wonderful any other time, except, of course, the time when we stayed there.

Instead of a cute Venetian canal, there were dredging machinery, dams, plywood, fencing and mud, which smelled so awful I had to cover my nose and mouth while walking up to and away from the lobby. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the room we ended up staying in (we asked to be moved to a room further away from the stench) was comfortable. However, had we known there would be dredging of the canal and the resulting smells and horrible views, we would have gladly stayed elsewhere. If you are considering booking a room there this summer, I highly suggest you contact the hotel in advance and ask when/if the dredging is finished and the canal put back in order.", "Date": "June 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cRomantic place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "candym", "ReviewID": "UR14586503", "Content": "We stayed here back in Sept. 06' and loved it.

As other reports testify, it IS difficult to find so here are our tips - On arriving at Fondamente Nove (Aliguna Blue line from the airport), turn immediately down the street to the left and walk past the Gesuiti Church on your left. Walk straight ahead through the square over 2 small bridges past a restaurant on your left. Continue straight ahead past the Co-op mini supermarket. After the shop take your first right and walk past Pizzeria La Perla on your left. The hotel Ca d'oro is at the end of this lane on your right - in the corner opposite the Gentlemen's clothes shop. - this sounds a bit of a trek but it a 10 minute walk at most. The Hotel has a fantastic location - highly recommend eating at Trattoria Casa Mia just seconds away from the hotel - turn right at the small estate agent and can highly recommend the roof terrace for a lazy early evening drink as the sun sets...just lovely! The room was spacious and clean and breakfast was great..one word of warning though...stock up on soft drinks, wine etc. at the Co-op as the description of 'bar' in the hotel is actually just the receptionist or night porter getting a couple of cans from a fridge in the kitchen and it's so much better (and much much cheaper) to be prepared by getting supplies in yourself.. Can recommend highly although at times, a couple of reception staff could have been a little friendlier...a minor snag Overall, a lovely break", "Date": "September 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat find it atmospheric Cannaregio\u201d", "Author": "wonderlanded", "ReviewID": "UR8724919", "Content": "We arrived rather exhausted at Ca' d'Oro after a hectic two week trip around the Balkans, and were delighted with it.

We arrived in the evening and were greeted warmly by the young lady on reception who welcomed us and handed us our key. On entering the room we were pleasantly surprised to say the least.
