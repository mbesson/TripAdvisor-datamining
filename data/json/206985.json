My client made the reservations for this hotel. The only good things going for the hotel are - the staff are nice and friendly - not far from the centre of the city Downsides - my room needed updating. The wallpaper was peeling - no decent work space. Not enough space to pull back the chair so I could work at the desk in the room - no restaurant. Coming back from the office late in the evening, you had to leave the hotel and walk 5-10 minutes to find a decent restaurant. - their idea of room service is a take-away pizza firm (and no, it's not Pizza Hut or Dominos) For a very short (perhaps a 1-2 day stay) it might be suitable.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cocoa fl", "Title": "\u201cComfortable Hotel\u201d", "Author": "taylorbrock", "ReviewID": "UR124150735", "Content": "I chose this hotel because it was close to where I had a business meeting. It was clean, comfortable and altogether pleasant. Also an excellent value. I would certainly stay here again. Upon arrival I took a cab from the airport.

It was a very good (and reasonably priced) choice. The NH is conveniently located within 5-10 minutes walking distance from the nearest subway/metro station and, as such, approx. 30 minutes 'door-to-door' from many of the city's main attractions. We even took the metro all the way from the airport to the hotel which took us about 40 minutes, including changing lines twice (not recommended if you carry a lot of heavy luggage since changing lines involves quite a lot of stairs/walking within stations). The hotel and rooms are quite modern, clean, and well maintained. We stayed in one of the standard double rooms on the third floor facing the main street. The room had a nice and comfortable feel to it and featured all the basic amenities you would except from a similar hotel (decent size closet, free safety deposit box, TV, small working desk, etc). The bathroom was also good-sized and clean. The breakfast buffet on the lobby floor was actually very good and had a good variety of foods and beverages. We didn't expect this at all. Thumbs up! There's free 30 minutes wifi in the lobby area that works just fine (we used our ipad). You need to get an access code from the front desk in order to use it. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful and speaks good English in case your Spanish is a bit rusty. The area around the hotel seems to be more of a residential area but there's some nice tapas bars and smaller fruit/fish shops along the main street. Try the tapas bar right across the street from the hotel. When we were there, temperatures were still up in the twenties (celsius) and it was nice to spend a couple of hours sitting outside eating tapas and sipping on sangria after a long day touring the city. In short, we can only recommend the NH and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cA good choice\u201d", "Author": "SonoraDweller", "ReviewID": "UR120050844", "Content": "In a residential area, not expensive, very clean and with a nice breakfast. Staff is friendly and attentive, and they do speak English. I liked the room, which had a safe, plenty of closet space, and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was clean, towels fresh, toiletries good class. I was there in October, so they had heat available and not a/c, and the others who wrote that the rooms were warm or hot is true. You cannot really turn it completely off. However, the window opens, and brings the temp down, so that it is not unpleasant to sleep. Internet charge is not high for the room, and it is free in the lobby. They will book and cancel tours for you.

We arrived in Madrid about 9am and thought we'd be cheeky and see if our rooms were ready. We didn't expect a positive response but great service from reception and we had our room 15 mins later. Free wifi in the lobby. Good sized room for two 40 somethings. The hotel is in a mainly residential area but only about 5-10 minutes walk to nearest metro station and easy to use the metro, we brought an all day ticket from the airport and used the subway all day. We felt safe all the time and would definitely return. We didn't eat in the hotel and there was no bar but opposite the hotel was a small bar used by locals which was friendly and we sat outside watching the world go by late on the Tuesday night.

Arrived at the hotel slightly ahead of the designated check-in time, but were given a room straight away. Rooms are almost of 4* quality, with good furniture and carpeted throughout. Bed is probably one of the highest I've seen (a good meter from floor to covers), but extremely comfortable. Rooms are equipped with a plasma tv with some international channels. There was, however, no wardrobe, only a desk. Our room had functioning aircon (although a bit noisy) and, interestingly, a ceiling-built radio. Bathroom was excellent, with a power-shower. Our package also included buffet breakfast, which was good although not much variety - just your usual cereal, toast, yoghurt, fruit and cake(s). It was a reasonable start to the day. The hotel itself was of modern standard. Free wifi was available in the lobby. As far as location goes, the NH Arguelles is set in a student area not too far from the centre of Madrid, although not walkable. There didn't seem to be any buses near the hotel and the nearest metro station is about 5-7 mins walk away. Because that particular line was closed over August, our walk to a different line was a bit longer. As far as parking goes, everywhere around the hotel is residents parking, so unless the hotel provides parking itself, it could cost you a bit. Finally let me just say that, although there might be a lot of graffiti in the surrounding area, we never had any problems either during the day or at night. In fact, we didn't have any problems or felt fearful at any point during our time in Madrid. All in all, and for \u20ac80 for the two nights for two people, we were pleased with our choice! PS: For those interested, the hotel had Pizza Hut room service!!", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH Arguelles", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d206985-Reviews-NH_Arguelles-Madrid.html", "Price": "$70 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Vallehermoso 65</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28015</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "206985", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/03/d3/03d384b9bdc533df0b2af2c30e86ab4e4large.jpg"}}
