Hotel itself is really quite poor but since everything in Venice is very expensive it can be considered as a cheap acommodation in the convenient place. Not much comfort though - room is very small, there's hardly a space to turn around. Same for bed - very short and narrow, you could call it Italian type or just uncomfortable sleep. Walls are thin, you can hear other guests speaking in the next room. Breakfast poor, but coffee was very good, just you have to ask for espresso, because as default they bring americana which sucks. Fair value for money in one of the most beautiful(and expensive) places on Earth which is Venice :)", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel at a nice location\u201d", "Author": "Cornhusker001", "ReviewID": "UR121686253", "Content": "Location: very close (5-min walking) to the train station and the Piazzale Roma bus station, from the later there are two shuttle buses to/from the Marco Polo Airport every 20 minutes. You need to cross only two small bridges to the Piazzale Roma bus station or one slightly larger bridge to the train station. This may be very beneficial if you have heavy luggage. From the hotel, you can essentially walk to anywhere in the city within half an hour. Particularly, there are many eateries/restaurants near the train station so you don't need to worry about find places to eat late in the evening. Facility: The rooms are not big with the U.S. standard but are more than adequate if you are not very big (over 250-300 pounds). There are a couple of bigger rooms and you may check with the staff to see if such rooms are available. My wife and I stayed twice in the hotel (before and after a cruise trip), first in a standard room and the second time in a big room. We felt very comfortable with both stays. For big people, the shower may be a little bit small but should still be manageable. The rooms are recently remodeled and do not feel old at all. Breakfast: Some people commented that the breakfast was continental type. It was simple but I think that it was pretty good, definitely not continental. The setting are nice and you have a variety of things to select. You can ask for different coffees to be served (rather than get from a big bottle by yourself). I found the hotel from Rick Steves' tour book. I emailed the hotel a couple of times before I booked. Each time I got very prompt response from Michaela and/or Giocomo, who run the hotel (also named in Steves' book). My wife and I chatted with Michaela a couple of times and also had some brief chatting with several other staff.

The accommodations are pretty modest - not alot to rave about, but a very reasonable price for the location. I didn't think we'd be able to stay inside the city for a decent price. There was no elevator, so you had to take your luggage up a narrow flight of stairs, but it wasn't bad. It's been a couple months, so I don't remember the breakfast, but I think it was decent - a typical continental. The wi-fi wasn't working the first night, but did the second.

As is quite common in Italy there is no tea making facility within the room, but there is a price list available for beverages from the hotel. However, when we asked for coffee after arriving we were told that there was no one in the kitchen. Except for muesli and yoghurt the breakfast was complete \"stodge\", and this was probably the worst breakfast I have ever had in a hotel.

Very convenient location less than 5 minutes walk to SL train station across one bridge of Grand Canal.

The airport bus is currently #5 but confusingly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop at stand 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you have to look at the timetables on each stand. Close to a good selection of shops, restaurants and ice cream ! Reasonably quiet. The only time we heard any noise at night was on a Saturday when some outside tables about 50m away were hosting drinking customers until the bar closed. The rest of the time we kept the windows open. Compare that to many other hotels that sit directly above restaurants or bars and you are unlikely to find something similar unless you go for a 4* + hotel. Good breakfast. Room provided to store luggage in on day of departure with toilet facilities available too. NOT SO GOOD The only downside to the location is its distance from the main Rialto / San Marco area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is a good 30 minute walk away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something to consider if you have very young children or are elderly. Then again if money is no problem the Grand Canal water boat stop outside the main station is very close. Walking the back streets allows you to explore the city, and after 2 or 3 goes you soon find your way a lot easier. Bedroom space rather limited. This is OK for a weekend break but might cause problems if you are visiting for a week or more. Although the room, linen, bathroom etc were spotless, previous guests had swatted mosquitoes and flies in our room. The hotel would be wise to clean these up occasionally as it does distract from the otherwise perfect appearance. This also is a warning not to open your window shutters at night whilst lights are on unless you wish to be dive bombed by insects in your sleep. TIPS Remember to validate train, bus ( inc. Airport ones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c half hour service ) and boat tickets in yellow machines before boarding. Use a co-op food store 10 minutes from the hotel for stocking up on soft drinks and water. The hotel also sells soft drinks and beer at reasonable prices. If money runs short also buy some rolls, crisps etc and sit out at a convenient spot for lunch. Navigate streets using signs for Rialto and San Marco. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid to ask for help \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everyone is friendly especially if you attempt some Italian words. Be prepared to pay > 6 euros for a beer at the Grand Canale and 3 euros for a two scoop ice cream cone. An independent boat trip to Murano island is well worth doing. Avoid costly guided tours and explore it yourself. When you check bags into the cloakroom before visiting the San Marco Basilica, you get a card to go straight to the front of the queue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like a Disney FastPass. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t join the main queue which could take hours. Inside, the steps to the external balcony where you can take photos is just to the right of the main entrance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cost is 4 euros pp. When you visit Doges Palace, clean toilets are on the first floor.

The hotel is definitely basic, with limited services and the public areas are not fancy. There is no lift. But the renovated rooms we encountered were clean, with nicely-done bathrooms (sufficient good towels, great shower and also hairdryers). Room size is small (fairly typical), but hopefully you are not spending your vacation time in the room.

Once shows the outside of the hotel, the other the view down the street towards the nearby shops. We plan to stay there the next time we go to Venice. No matter where you stay, book ahead. There is no real off-season in the city.", "Date": "April 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, CT", "Title": "\u201cEasy to find\u201d", "Author": "bbyron", "ReviewID": "UR5332180", "Content": "I found the hotel very easy to get to. This was a big plus after getting off the train and wandering through the station. The hotel's website gave a great little 3D map of how to get there. It only took me 10 minutes on foot with a big backpack. After checking in and dropping my luggage on the bed, I was free to explore the rest of Venice on foot or the vaporetto. Other travelers had to board the vaporetti with their luggage or hire a taxi. The staff was patient and quickly resolved a problem I had with the phone. The breakfast in the morning was acceptable. The single room I stayed in wasn't much more than a glorified dorm room (closet space, small desk, tiny bed, cold tile floor), but I only planned to be in Venice for one night. In late May, the room got a little bit cold and I couldn't find any kind of thermostat or heater. No extra blankets or pillows were in the room. It's my own fault though that I didn't ask the reception desk for extras.", "Date": "June 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "MCC4", "ReviewID": "UR5229871", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at Albergo Marin for 3 nights in May.
