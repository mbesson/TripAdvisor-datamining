When we arrived at the hotel, the staff at the reception was ok, a bit cold though. We went to our room using the old elevator, which was tricky to use (BE careful with your fingers !!!!) and not always working so be ready to do some sport to get to your room! The general aspect of the room was all right, furnished with old stuff which gave it a bit of charm. We had a double bed and a single one. It was equipped with a microwave, TV\u9225\ue6c7nd a VERY SMELLY fridge. After one EXTREMELY NOISY night, I got bitten by what I thought was a mosquito but maybe it was something else as there were no mosquitoes in the room (Bedbugs???) and spent the following 2 weeks with horrible itchy bites over my face and neck ! My friend who slept in the single bed had a horrible back pain when she woke up.We did have breakfast included but had to do a bit of walking as it is served in the other building (what is called the Adelaide hostel). Fortunately it was not raining!. My boyfriend almost lost one of his fingers when trying to close the door of the bedroom.After 2 days, as I was searching for my hairbrush, I noticed that the room was not so clean as I found lots of bits and pieces that seemed to have been under the bed and between the bed and the wall forever as well as lots of dust \u9225\ue6cfncluding travel tickets from previous residents!). To conclude, this place is ok if you don\u9e93t mind not-so-clean-bedrooms, stinky fridge, Bedbugs, noise. Bring ear plugs and wear boxing Gloves!I will not recommend this hotel to my friends. I went back to San Francisco 2 weeks later and stayed at the Mayflower hotel, which I highly recommend.

You are about 10 minutes walk from Powell Street BART which comes directly from the airport. However I must warn you that you will be going up one of San Francisco's famous hills to get there, so add on another 5 mins if you have much luggage! The hotel is really a hostel, with a friendly lobby with free internet etc. Breakfast is included, though I never made it over to eat it (it's cooked and eathen in a sister hotel about 2 mins walk away). The room was a fairly good size, and I understand that they have various different options in terms of private/shared etc, but mine was a private with bathroom. Free WiFi in the rooms. Location not too bad, felt safe enough coming back to it at night and you can get to the piers by taking the cable car from Powell Street, but rememebr if you are planning on doing much walking around San Francisco be sure to be fit!! The hills are steep!

It is easy to walk to from the Powell Street BART if you don't have much luggage - the area around the Hotel is totally safe.The cable car runs two blocks over, so you can buy a five day ticket and use that to get down to Chinatown, North Beach and the tourist areas if that's your thing.Highly recommended!", "Date": "Feb 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR746081152", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ruethewhirl551"}, {"Content": "Affordable San Francisco charm! We (a couple) felt comfortable returning to the hotel more than once whenever we needed a super affordable place to stay in downtown SF. For the age of the hotel, and considering the sky-high prices of MOST hotels in the area (regardless of age), this was a gem. I haven't seen the place since 2004, but we stayed at least a week once, completely satisfied. I lived in the SF area at the time and knew this was a very reasonable choice. It is located on Post street, which is literally a few blocks from *everything* downtown SF has to offer. Short walk to the famous cable cars (right on top of the BART station coming from SFO airport), Union Square, great places to eat and loads of public transportation. The hotel is also situated at the bottom of nob hill, so there is very little inclination to the streets -- no steep hills to worry about! In most cases, staying in a decent part of downtown or nob hill *will* require hiking up a crazy steep hill to access the place. Not the case with Dakota. Very easy to access! Convenient little markets surrounding the neighborhood for last minute needs also (ATM, late night snacks).The few blocks where Dakota sits is not the most sparkling clean area of downtown, however it is securely located a few streets up from the most sketchy part -- the Tenderloin. I actually lived a few blocks from Dakota and always felt as safe as possible in one of the busiest downtowns in America. Most of SF (outside the million-dollar hoods) is older and a little dirty, but most of it is safe! If you stay on Post Street at the Dakota, just remember to stay away from south of Geary street unless you stick to the main strip Market st. (keep your map open always!!). Blocks in San Francisco are shorter than usual and it is a given that almost anywhere in the city you can literally turn 2 blocks one way into luxury and 2 blocks the other direction into the ghetto. You can't let that scare you though because most of SF is like this and the Dakota is in a prime location within the best proximity to everything. Even if you make a wrong turn, there are always people everywhere in SF (usually at all hours) and you can just as easily make a quick turn back out with no problems. Back to the hotel itself. I would definitely recommend it as a place to stay for someone on a budget but not wanting to settle for a shack in the worst part of town. No worries choosing this place. I read several of these reviews for hotels because I travel a lot, and I know it all depends on where you are coming from. If you are used to staying in a royal palace with daily pampering then some places might seem like a dump to you. However, for the average person, this is a clean, charming, safe, affordable place to stay. Btw, there is usually no parking (or hard to find street spots with meters), so best solution is to NOT DRIVE into town, but catch the BART train from the airport, if you are traveling in from out of town. Getting around SF by foot and bus/train is a breeze, no car needed unless you want to go out of town. Our room was clean, bed was comfortable and there is usally a cool little view of the downtown landscape from the window. Some unique little surprises were the birdcage elevator and old fashioned claw foot bath tub. Hallways and rooms are little narrow and carpets are a little older, but honestly, MOST buildings you enter in San Francisco are SMALL, antique and will have older carpeting, walls, etc. This is a long post, but the Dakota is a little gem among places alike in the area. We never had any bed bugs or any problems while staying there. I cant remember problems of any significant street noise, however staying *anywhere* downtown will put you around tons of firetrucks blaring their sirens round the clock. Unless you're rich enough to afford one of the shining modern giant hotels dowtown, or royal historical landmarks up the hill, this is about as good as it gets for staying within budget in the aging, yet charming city of San Francisco.", "Date": "Feb 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR312580569", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mxxi"}, {"Content": "a no frills bargain!

The guy at the reception couldn't really explain and I didn't understand why the room I got assigned 3 months ago had suddenly turned unavailable, but when I saw the entrance of the Adelaide hotel I took the news as a relief... So we went to the Dakota which is a few meters from the Adelaide. Perfect location next to Union Square, shops and buses, really cheap (70dollars for a twin room and we were given two rooms within one for free). The room had a fridge and a microwave as decoration (they didn't work). The bathroom was in the room and has a tub which was nice even if I dare you to have a bath in it... The carpet on the floor seemed to be there since the 60's but hey, we're not supposed to sleep on the floor. We were happy to be in SFO so we did'nt bother. Everything was looking good so far until we came back at night. Our room was facing Post street so it was kind of noisy all night. The first night I woke up because of the noise on the street, I took a look on my mobile to check the time and I saw a black spot on the sheet right next to my face. I got up to turn the lights on and check what it was : a BEDBUG!!! I took rid of it and check the rest of the bed which was full of hair from previous fellows...The next night I got bitten by something I thought it was a moskito, but maybe the bebugs can bite. I ended up with 6 itchy bites on my body...So to sum up, if you're looking for a nice place to rest, a clean and peaceful environment, then AVOID this hotel.

I am an artist and strive to travel cheaply and stay in cool, artsy places which is why I initially picked this hotel. I lived most of my life in the Bay Area and went to art school in S.F. I have to agree with the person who gave this one star. I was in San Francisco for a few days to visit my family and did not want to stay with them. My room was bare bones ( no art- a sadnote for this bohemian artist) and FREEZING! no HEAT! I stayed at the beginning of March and I called the front desk to ask them nicely if I could have an extra blanket and told them ( NICELY!) there was no heat in my room. The person at the front desk refused to give me a blanket and said someone would fix the heat- well they didn't. I wore my clothes including long underwear and my long winter coat and lay in bed frozen to the bone. I felt awful the next day. The televison set in the room did not work AT all but I did not even mention this to the hotel staff. I am giving this hotel 2 stars instead one out of fairness to a few things which include The old fashioned cage metal elevator is VERY cool- I felt like I was on the set of LAST TANGO IN PARIS AND very cool bar called the OWL TREE ( I don't drink but it's worth a trip) directly across the street. paintings, sculptures, dioramas etc. of Owls. The decor of the owl lounge is pure kitsch 70s a la Quentin Tarantino- just go. Also the hotel is a few blocks from Union Square- a great location but borders on the Tenerloin so you will be harassed by street people for money. I advise you to bypass going to the famed SEARS FINE FOODS restaurant on Powell Street - a tourist mecca. I paid $20 with tip for lousy pancakes, coffee and bacon.

I stayed 5 nights as a single traveller. I had a nice room, clean and well appointed. The en suite was fine, quite big with a bath doubling up as a shower. The hotel staff were very friendly and cheerful. There was plenty of brochures etc, and coffee in the morning. The only slight fault would be noise from Post St in the morning. The windows don't seem to be very well sealed. However, this didn't really bother me at all. The birdcage elevator is an experience and very entertaining, not something you can say about most elevators. The hotel is in an excellent location, 4 minutes from Union Square and on a very safe block. There was occasionly one or two homeless people around, but there was no hint of trouble. Homelessness is quite prevalent in San Francisco and you won't find any street without one or two. However there was no problems or hassle from then in my experience and I certainly wouldn't say that it was a negative influence on what is a fantastic city and well worth visiting. For $56 a night, I couldn't have asked for much more.", "Date": "Oct 13, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR583386156", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Unique and lovely.

We got a room for $50 a night. Incredible value! The hotel is approximatley 2 blocks from Union Square, on Post St. We were in the middle of the busiest part of town, for a great rate. We were able to hop on all the public transpo options due to our great location.The room is small, but IMO very doable, especially for the price in San Francisco. The claw-footed bathtub looked cool, but we didn't partake in taking a bath...who knows how often they clean it? The bathroom was way small, and I felt a little disgusted in there after I took a shower, since the small-tiled floor would get all grimy...Microwave, fridge, TV. Upon arriving, we discovered that the sink was clogged and a lightbulb was missing. They fixed that within the hour. Noise doesn't really bother me, but for others it may...it can get noisy. The most common noise, I would say, is that of the firetrucks that whir by non-stop.I definitely recommend it.", "Date": "Jun 4, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR419822354", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "novicetraveller83"}, {"Content": "Great for the money               More photos", "Date": "May 19, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR780500641", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "orangeman"}, {"Content": "Good for price... thats it When me and some relatives decided to visit San Fransico, we planned on staying a night in SF and then going to San Jose where my brother lives. The hotel itself was nice, except for the unreliable elevator. My brother almost lost a limb trying to get out of it because it started moving while we were trying to get out. This hotel is not for little kids because the steep stairs, the unreliable elevator, open windows (on the inside) that open into an old elevator shaft where if a child was to crawl on the window, they would possibly fall to their death. Noise wasnt that bad, but I sleep with a fan on high at home. Certain things annoyed me about the hotel though, such as the fact that the staff gave us ----- directions, didn't tell us we were on the street that the Chinese New Year parade would go down and that fridge wouldn't work, the telephone wouldn't work, and there were no batteries in the TV remotes. But I can't really gripe... we got a discount on two Suites (if thats what they call that little box of a room, since my used her husbands Southwest Airlines discounts. Also, don't go out at night unless you feel like being asked for change.
