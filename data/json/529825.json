The hotel is an authentic Italian hotel with lovely furniture. It is ideally located near the Vatican which s a 5 minute walk away. The hotel is situated on one of the little side streets and is surrounded by lots of little local shops and cafes which was very good. At night it is easy to get to sleep as you are not on the main street. The staff are very friendly and will help you any way they can. The hotel is clean and fresh and I would certainty recommend it to someone else.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan, USA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location; Good Value\u201d", "Author": "tazdev71", "ReviewID": "UR66106020", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, May 24-27. 7 minute walk to St Peter's. The room was on the 3.5 floor. Not a typo. Very spacious room and bathroom. Huge balcony. The bed was quite comfortable. Typical Rome hotel in that the floor was tile and a bit dusty. But they give you slippers if you didn't bring your own. The furniture is a bit dated. 1970ish. But, you don't go to Rome for the hotel. We had to pay an extra 5 euro/night to use the AC. We got such a great rate on the room, we didn't mind. The breakfast is typical Rome; pane and cafe latte. Which worked for us. The daytime reception desk attendant was very friendly and spoke pretty good English. The nighttime reception desk attendant was a bit grumpy, but spoke excellent English. They have a computer in the lobby you can use, I think it was 2 euros for an hour. And they have water and soda available for purchase too. Try the restaurant immediately to the right of the hotel lobby door if you want something relatively affordable. It was our first stay at this hotel. But my parents, sister and other friends have all stayed there previously. We would choose them again.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartlepool", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed stay at Della Conciliazione\u201d", "Author": "cmt2004", "ReviewID": "UR10978046", "Content": "The hotel is situated about five minutes walk from the vatican.The room I had was clean and tidy and of a reasonable size compared to some that I have stayed in Rome.

The Reception area is a little old fashioned, but the rooms are fine. Some rooms were a little small and not too much storeage space, but everything was clean. Breakfast was rolls, cheese, ham, croissant and coffee bought around by a fabulously hyperactive Italian lady who had been there for years! The street has plenty of restaurants and bars for food and also seems to be pedestrianised most of the time so no problems sleeping. Yes it's across the river from the main parts of town but we didnt find this a problem at all, and in fact enjoyed the walks back to the hotel in the evening, with a lovely gelato of course! Price wise - my single was 110 Euros a night, but you're paying for the location. The reception staff were courteous and helpful too.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "YORKSHIRE", "Title": "\u201cloved this hotel\u201d", "Author": "YorkshireMary", "ReviewID": "UR7227082", "Content": "Had a really good stay at this hotel .the staff were polite and the rooms were very clean ,ideal for visiting the Vatican as its only a few minutes walk away .
