The apartment was spacious with a small kitchen within the lounge area, a separate bedroom and modern bathroom. The air conditioning wasn't great and made the room smell of smoke one night, also we did hear a bit of noise from other rooms however overall we had a good couple of night's sleep here! The pool was a great addition, especially after a long day of walking around Madrid. The apartments are next door to a good supermarket that sold everything we needed to make our own meals so overall our stay was really good value for money and cheaper than many of Madrid's numerous hotels.

I am 6'3 and i had to sleep w/ my legs hanging over the end of the bed. also they are as hard as rocks and are tiny singles. I don't understand why they can't get the bed situation correct in Spain... US hotels do it so much better! - the shower is not consistent. Upon start up, it is scalding hot, with no ability to cool it down. Then suddenly it is chilly... then scalding hot again. If you are patient (3 minutes) it will sort itself out though. Another humorous thing is the size of the bathroom soap bars- so tiny you won't believe it - no alarm clock in the room - TV didnt work - wifi available for extra charge but didnt work well at all - you really have to be in or close to the lobby All the comments about location in the reviews are correct- it's in a great spot.

In summer you can enjoy the famous caf\u00e9 terraces in Juan Bravo street. There is also a dry-cleaners nearby, though I didn't check to see if they do laundry. Having read the reviews here, we brought our own sponge and washing-up liquid, and cooked for ourselves and two friends each night. The hole-in-the-wall kitchen is obviously not really meant for four-person meals, but we got by, and had just enough cutlery and plates. The concierge said with a rueful smile that the soap dispensers in the kitchens of the apartments had stopped working. But everything else in the apartment was well maintained and perfectly clean.

The room is sufficient for two of us with all the basic, clean amenities. Cleaning twice a week for month-long guests. I do wish the bed was bigger though. Some of the staff at reception aren't as friendly as others. But it's true that this is more of a residential apartment building than a hotel.

Anyone would have thought we had asked for the impossible - but after much huffing and puffing a room was unlocked to reveal a dedicated luggage room!

Staying a week is about the same price-wise as staying for 4 days. I also recommend for the self-service laundry, which is crucial for visits lasting longer than a week. As others have mentioned, there is a small grocery store right next door. There's a great breakfast place about 2 blocks away and a bookstore (Crisol) is 3 blocks distant. The bars in the area are exceptionally good and frequented by locals and not tourists. You can pay extra for internet connection but it's also possible to connect directly without paying anything. The staff is very nice and does its best to attend to visitors and their needs. However, keep in mind that this is not a hotel. The individual who mans the desk is not there to recommend restaurants and such, rather he is there for the safety of the guests to monitor the traffic in and out of the apartments.

Its central, lots of restaurants nearby, Metro station literally at the end of the block. The rooms are decent sized (not massive, but we were 3 adults and had plenty of room). Its not really a hotel, but more an apartment building in which the apartments are rented out by the day or week. We had a kitchenette with microwave, fridge/freezer, sink, dishes. Bathroom was clean and good sized, with a tub/shower. We had one bedroom (with two singles), and the livingroom had a sofa which substituted as a bed. Also had a table with chairs, and an easy chair to sit in. For a small fee (10 euros for all 3 days) we got a WiFi login/password, though it was far from the fastest connection I've had. Also has a color TV, with about 20 stations. Most are Spanish, but also included two German, one French, one Italian, CNN International (English), Eurosport (also English), and an MTV station that was sometimes English, sometimes German. There is a Starbucks at the end of the block (next to the Metro station) though it doesn't open until 10am. There is also a Pizza Hut literally two doors away, but i STRONGLY advise avoiding it! We got a pizza there one night (plain cheese) and we couldn't decide if the taste was perfume or industrial waste, but it was AWFUL! On the good side, there is a small supermarket on the ground floor of the hotel where you can get pop, snacks and fruit and cereral. By the way, if you're unfamiliar with Spain, most places close for lunch around noon-2 or 2:30, and close for the evening around 7-8pm. Its normal to go out for dinner at 8-10pm here (and unusual to eat any earlier than 7pm, in fact many restaurants don't even open until 8 or later). There is one person sitting in a little office in the entryway, and you check in with him, but other than that contact is minimal, and he offers no real help or information. There's also an outdoor swimming pool on the 2nd floor, but it wasn't open when we were there (too early in the season). FYI, the hotel is about 20-30 minutes from the airport (depending on time of day) by taxi and the fare runs about 30-35 euros.

Maid service with towel change is twice per week. Tell the front desk what time of day you prefer that service, so you are not surprised by the door buzzer. (There is no \"Do Not Disturb\" option, but once I understood the system, I simply asked that no one come before 11 AM, and all has been fine since.) I would absolutely stay here again. (I am a single woman here for a three month stint and have felt quite comfortable). The staff is very friendly and helpful. The neighborhood is one of the best in Madrid, the \"old money\" neighborhood of Salamanca, quite nice, very safe, and not overwhelmingly \"touristy.\" As noted in the 2003 review, the metro is steps away, and one of the most efficient transportation systems I have used. Even the most die-hard suburbanites will be riding the metro to all points in Madrid within a day and with minimum effort. (If you have somehow ended up in Madrid with no Metro map, go down the steps into the station, walk up to the service window and ask for \"un plano de metro.\") A grocery store, restaurant, beauty shop, take out pizza shop, are on the immediate block, and several ATM machines within two blocks. Good thing--a great shopping district. If you need to park a car, you'll find a private garage. Studios and one-bedrooms have kitchenettes. I often walk to the city center, the Prado, Thyssen and Reina Sofia museums as well as to the beautiful Retiro Park. I'm a stroller, not a brisk walker (Madrid being a great city in which to stroll), so these walks take a good 30 minutes with window shopping stops along the way, but they are lovely! The metro cuts the transport time down to 10-15 minutes, depending on your destination. While I would probably think twice about staying here were this my first visit to Madrid and my time tight, if you are staying a week or longer, or are already somewhat familiar with the city, it's a very good choice. For those of you who are really bothered by noise, do note, the walls are thin; the traffic can get noisy at rush hour, and two hospitals are close, so you will hear sirens--I pop the earplugs in at night, though, and sleep like a baby!
