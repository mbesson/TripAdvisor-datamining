Second gap, staff speak only Italian, so isn\u2019t easy make necessary settlements. Next bad thing, we have to wait about 45 minutes until staff found the key\u2026 Taking into consideration really cheap price and convenient place (within the walk distance to the Piramide underground and train station, border of the historic part of the Rome) we survived all, however I have to confess I became scared what will be next. And here surprise, next went only better. However buffet breakfast in this B&B mean you could prepare it on your own, and I would named this place apartment with some food provided as surplus, anyway was well equipped kitchen, with espresso machine and toaster. Soft drinks, milk, butter in the fridge, croissants, toast bread and jam available. Air conditioning unit in the bedroom, bathroom clean, and even with washing machine, wireless internet, in every window blinds mechanically driven. In my opinion bedroom was a bit small for 4 persons, but when you sightseeing all day is not big disadvantage. Last remark, trains are running not far from the window, so if you want to spent remarkable part of time of your stay inside it isn\u2019t place for you. Lets resume \u2013 cheap and convenient for Rome exploration accommodation, average staying conditions, perfect match mark is: acceptable.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat B&B - beware the location\u201d", "Author": "forewarn_forearm", "ReviewID": "UR118253480", "Content": "We booked the Cleopatra B&B after reading other favourable reviews. We weren't disappointed by the facilities. The rooms are in an apartment building in a residential neighbourhood. Our room and bathroom were very clean - plus, we had our own air conditioner! And we liked that we were left on our own to come and go as we pleased. The kitchen was stocked with toast, cakes and pastries, yogurt, cereal and milk, and coffee. There was also free Wi-Fi. We chose to travel on a budget, and this place met all our expectations. While we enjoyed our stay at the Cleopatra B&B, there are a couple of things to note about it. We found getting into the apartment tricky. We couldn't get the hang of the lock at the front door, and judging by the sounds of the other guests struggling to get in, they couldn't either. Also, it isn't located in the middle of all the action. It's about a 5-10 minute walk to the metro station (Pyramide), which was handy in the mornings. But the metro appeared to shut down quite early (around 9 pm -- one day it wasn't running at all because of maintenance). The city bus service in Rome is pretty easy to sort out -- the route numbers and stop locations are all listed at each bus stop -- but there aren't many buses that run directly by the B&B that we could see. We did manage to catch one that dropped us off at Pyramide. But if the metro isn't running, and you choose not to take the bus, you're in for a long hike back from the main attractions. The closest ones are probably Circo Massimo and the Coliseum, and they're about a 30 min walk away. It took us an hour and 20 minutes to walk to Vatican City from the B&B, following the river. Trastevere is a great neighbourhood that's nearby and an easy walk from the B&B. Check it out if you choose to stay at the Cleopatra.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean, compact, friendly B&B.

Recently refurbished, the rooms are small, but very clean and bathroom facilities are again to a high standard. The B&B is 5 a minute walk down the road from a metro station (Piramide) and overground connections to Ostia. This makes the location excellent if you want to spend a few days in the city and a few on the beach. Breakfast takes the format of \"help yourself to anything in the kitchen\" - Which was well stocked with Juice, yogurts, bread and jam, and brioche style sweet breads. There is also a coffee machine which makes excellent coffee! I would highly recommend this B&B for anyone looking to have a clean and comfortable city break for under 100 euros per night. Also apparently has free Wi-Fi though i didn't use this facility.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg, Russia", "Title": "\u201cVery nice b&b.

Very beautiful interior of the apartment, quiet big rooms with good furniture and modern equipment, clean kitchen with everything necessary for comfortable staying...The location is ok: 5 min walking to the metro/bus stop and about 10-15 min by bus to the city center (2 stops by subway to Colosseum). The staff is very nice helpful people. Definitely best value for this money!:) The only bad thing is a train which passes few meters from your windows...BUT: 1. The trains do not pass at night time (11 pm - 6 am) 2. You don't really hear them when the window is closed. So the trains didn't disturb us at all...:)", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cleopatra B&B", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d2040824-Reviews-Cleopatra_B_B-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$79 - $125*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Pellegrino Matteucci, 41 scala D</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00144</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2040824", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d0/45/d04531289b25965caa73746398b8a7161large.jpg"}}
