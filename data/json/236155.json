If you like the nightlife, this is a good location, as there are several bars and nightclubs just a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

From what I had heard, I was prepared to be underwhelmed. I have stayed at a couple of other hotels in Italy that were converted convents, and did not expect much. When I entered the room, my face lit up with a smile. Yes, it was not as large as you would find at an American corporate hotel, but considering that other hotel rooms in which I have stayed in Rome were not much larger than the twin bed in the room, it was spacious enough. The room was clean and sunny, with only a bit of noise from the school that is nearby. By night, the room was quieter than others where I've stayed in Rome. At no time did I feel that my quality of sleep was hindered by noise. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fair, and a bit of fresh fruit would have improved things considerably. The brewed coffee was a treat; I didn't check to see if would have been possible to get a cappucino or latte, as I was ready for an alternative to espresso drinks. The location seemed to be good for a few days stay in Rome, and the tariff was quite reasonable. The Tevere (Tiber) is nearby, the Vatican is about a 40-minute walk away, and Trastevere is across the river. On the final night, we ate at a restaurant a couple of blocks away, and had one of the best meals that I've eaten on seven visits to Italy. Yes, the bathroom was small, and the shower about the size of a phone booth, but everything was clean and worked well. From other reviews,. it appears that the rooms can be inconsistent, but I had no complaints with the room I had. It's probably a good idea to check in advance, to get a good one.

The Econo Lodge on Main street in Winnemucca, Nevada is quieter. The bathrooms are very small with the classic 2' x 2' Italian shower, but instead of the usual Plexiglas doors, they come with very clingy shower curtains. It's like being smothered in wet tissue paper. You're lucky if housekeeping remembers to give you clean towels. They will, however, always remove the dirty ones, leaving you with no towel at all.

Altogether it is close to the heart of Rome yet somehow off the tourist track. Pros: * They have internet access. Used it to book train. * Staff very nice overall, and accomodating. * helped in booking taxi, making concert reservations - manager very nice * very quiet - hard to find in Italy Cons: * breakfast is mediocre * there seems to be a primary school next door. Wakes you up early on weekdays * one waiter was rude - we had come down for breakfast, and apparently he had just rearranged one section of the dining room for lunch. There were no signs, so we just picked a table, only to be greeted with a \"no, no, no\" from that waiter. How are we supposed to know? No manners. Issues: * Did not have room I requested upon arrival, so upgraded us to bigger room with promise to move us the next day. The new room had a private bathroom, but like many Italy hotels, the bathroom was not in the room. They gave us a discount for that inconvenience. Next day we decided to stay in the big room and keep the discount. * Somewhat hard to find. We did fine ourselves with a combination of Metro and bus the first time. Second time I had run out of cash [no banks open on weekends] and so couldn't use Metro. Had to wait 1 hour at the station for a cab that takes credit cards, and he had a hard time finding the place.

Hotel Santa Prisca has been our choice three trips in a row because of it's central location, it's cleanliness, it's excellent value, and the delightful Signore DeLuca who patiently answers our questions in perfect English. The rooms are small (remember, it was a convent) but very quiet and they face a central courtyard, that keeps the street noise to a whisper, and the hot Roman sun to a minimum. The hotel is on a small hill above street level and has parking for guests, although we do not recommend driving in major cities when public transportation is so great. The Pyramid metro stop is two blocks away and trams are all around the hotel. There is a small train station next door to the metro where you can depart for Ostia Antica (a must if you can't go to Pompei). Hotel Santa Prisca is in the Testaccio neighborhood that housed slaughterhouses and tanneries 100 years ago. The urban poor wasted nothing and developed a \"cucina povera\" based on the \"5th quarter\" that guide books refer to as \"variety meats\" (tripe, brains, liver, kidneys etc.). It's an easy walk across the river to Trestevare for inexpensive restaurants, but one of our favorites, Perelli's, is across the street from the hotel. It serves typical \"5th quarter\" Roman dishes. Try the oxtail sauce over penne and the typical roman artichokes, you won't regret it. If a snack is what you want, the best deli in Rome is also across the street from Hotel Santa Prisca. Volpetti's has the best cheeses, cold cuts, and breads for your picnic or you can go to their caffeteria around the corner called Volpetti Piu. If you crave fresh fruits and vegetables, walk one block west of the hotel and you'll find the Testaccio Market, a daily open air covered market with many merchants selling all kinds of food, housewares, and clothing.
