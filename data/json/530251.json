Non smiling and unpleasant receptionist ... we have reservation, and she got our name in her book, it was corresponding with our passport but she did not want to give us room if we could not provide the Printed reservation voucher ... for sure we both have had it in our computer to show her .. but she did not accepted it, she wanted the printed version ... and I'm sure that I'm like every business traveler ... I bring my laserjet printer with me all around the world ... 20 mns discussion only for that ... when we finally make it .. then she asked us to fill a paper to give our mother and father's name and surname ... I was in another hotel in Ankara the night before, and i was in the Asur Hotel in Istanbul (that I highly recommend) the 2 night before, and I was not questioned or Harassed like that just to check-in ... you can forget that anyone help you with luggage ... it does not seems include in the price (while it was the most expensive of the 3 hotels i went while in istanbul) Room are just as small as a kitchenette ... cleanliness is under average ... They have a minibar, but empty and unplug. and still, each time going in and out, have to ask the key to that girl who was unable to smile at all ... The day after, for the check out ... a smiling guy, finally, but for the worth... he asked us if we were going to the airport, and if so, the Hotel is working with a confident Taxi driver that he will call strait away to bring us to the airport ... I did understand the smile while, passing in front of the airport entrance, he manage to make us a full round around the airport which cost double the normal price, Thank you to this helping and smiling staff", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cWonderfully Helpfull Staff\u201d", "Author": "HoetjesPeeck", "ReviewID": "UR103999299", "Content": "Never before have we had the pleasure of staying in a hotel with such a helpfull staff.

The rooms are just about ok.The season we travelled was the beginning of winter and hence wedid not need any airconditioning since the temperature was between 10-15 degC. The hotel offers bed and breakfast, thougn the breakfast is passable.All the stuff on the menu for breakfast was cold and not palatable. No staff on the floor for the breakfast service. It lookked like they were short stafffed. Room service too was not upto the mark.The staff would have to be reminded time and again for the service. The only positive point is the location in the central area called Kumkapi which is famous all over Istanbul for the fish restaurants.Variety of fish available in the area and the restaurants outside the hotel offer a good variety. If you would just want to keep yopur bags and just rest for the night then this is an ok place,else you may look for accomodatio elsewhere.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "trygvenorway", "ReviewID": "UR31724516", "Content": "Stayed there at the end of April 2009. The rooms were clean and quite ok.No noise from the street as I was in the backyard. A bit of noise from the school near by- didn't bother me. The breakfast was served in a very nice room, and it was very good included home made yougurt and vegetables. Descriotion to find the hotel could have been beter. You ought to change to the efficient tram station and go a couple of stops from Akasarry to Beyazit and down Methapasa street. The hotel is very central to the main tram line(which you will use a lot) and a lot of attractions. There is a little hill to climb to get to the tram- but nothing really if you are at good health.

We selected the hotel as it advertised resident parking which was essential for the 3 minibuses our squad had. As it turned out it has a tiny lane which you would be lucky to be able to park a small car in and as a result we had to park at an expesive \"otopark\" along the street or on the street itself which was not appreciated by the locals. The windows were not sound proof and while the Hotel appears to be on a back a street- it is a very busy backstreet with heavy traffic and horns beeping form 5.30 am. Further the walls were paper thin and you could hear when anyone above flushed the toilet. Having said all this the staff were very friendly and the hotel was definately clean and comfortable although VERY basic. It was a good 20 minute walk to the Aya Sophia, Blue Mosque etc but it did allow you to see the real Istanbul! The breakfast was also basic. Baguettes, feta, tomato, cucumber etc or corn flakes. When we first arrived we immediately planned to find alternative accomodation once our competition was finished. however when the time came we were happy to spend the extra 3 nights here.
