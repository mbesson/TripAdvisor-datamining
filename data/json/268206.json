We arrived to discover an enormous generator running full throttle outside. Unfortunately the hotel had received a power cut a few days prior which had yet to be fixed. Our room was on the top floor above the generator, so not much sleep for us, after walking all over Boston that day. An older hotel with charm and friendly staff, and an overpowering smell of cleaning fragrance in the entry foyer. Our bed was very firm to sleep on along with the pillows. No give or take there. We overslept, so ate breakfast around the corner at Dunkin' Donuts.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Maine", "Title": "\u201cGrim\u201d", "Author": "Citizen_of_Amherst", "ReviewID": "UR126455985", "Content": "The lobby and the facade of this hotel don't look bad at all, but our room was grim. It reminded me of the dorm room at my under-funded state university. Yet at least the sheets on the bed in my dorm room actually fit and the comforter or duvet was not designed for a much smaller bed. For that matter, the dorm room's heat source did not blow hot air on my head as I slept. The heater in my room at this hotel was right by the bed. I wouldn't say that my hotel room was dirty, but the furniture was cheap and old, and the bathroom was shabby. I just love stepping into a shower and placing my feet on some grungy non-slip matting. The shower curtain rings were too small for the rod, so I couldn't actually close the curtain. The depressing yellow walls throughout the room were banged up as well. I like old hotels. I get that the rooms might be small and the bathrooms quirky. I've stayed at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, which is also an older hotel. Yet my room at the Park Plaza was a palace compared to this depressing little hole. We couldn't wait to leave and noticed that no one at the front desk asked us if we had enjoyed our stay. Why ask a question when you already know the answer?", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, simple, inexpensive\u201d", "Author": "Craig F", "ReviewID": "UR126423390", "Content": "I've been staying here for over 10 yrs, I also used to work here, ha!

Check in was a breeze and Claudette was very helpful. We parked right across the street and got a discount coupon for parking. Very close to train, mall and everything. The lobby and elevators look like they have been redone. Our room was clean but very outdated. We didnt mind as it was only for a night. There was free wifi and a breakfast in the morning BUT only served to 9:00AM even on the weekends.?? Didnt like that, but there was a one cup coffee pot in the room. They had bath & body works essentials in the bathroom and plenty of towels.

We used the T to get there from the airport. Only 5 minute walk to Green Line! Dunkin Donuts around the corner. Breakfast was pretty decent: cereal, toast, bagels, pastries, muffins, tea, coffee, juice and fruit. The hotel itself is old though. They've tried updating furniture to make it newer. When we walked it, the lobby has an old musty smell. I consider these small incidentals though, because we wanted an affordable and clean room in the city center and thats what we got. Front desk staff were really nice. Complimentary internet access in the business center, with printing. We would stay again even though its not a top notch hotel.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat old hotel right in the middle of Copely\u201d", "Author": "Joe M", "ReviewID": "UR124980710", "Content": "My wife and I spent a night at this hotel this weekend for $69 , after getting a deal from Travel Zoo.com.

We walked to the conference every day and saved almost $200/night!! It is not new but it is clean. It looks like the last renovation was in the 70's or so. The bathrooms are brown porcelain tile, TV's are tube TV's etc. The lobby is gorgeous and the breakfast/coffee in the morning was served on a nice sun room built out form the hotel. This hotel is right near the orange and green lines, a short walk to Roylston Street shopping and you can literally see Copley Square from the front door. Its an incredibly low price for its location and the beds were comfortable, the water was hot and the elevators worked.
