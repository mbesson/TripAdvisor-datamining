When we saw the room (in semi-detached bungalow) and the hotel facilities, coupled with the fact it is German owned and very well run, we thought it was well worth the 50 Euros/night. The Pondok Sari is set in jungle type gardens, with lilly ponds, a swimming pool, a spa (choice of massages) , a bar and restaurant with views to the beach and ocean. The rooms were large, with mosquito net, daily fresh flowers and a wonderful outdoor bathroom. The quality, variety and size of the breakfasts were amazing. Great snorkelling and diving trips leave daily from the hotel. We can hardly think of anything negative - ok, we could hear our neighbours' voices and their early morning alarm in the room next to us. The hotel is one of a small number built amongst the original village of Pemuteran and all the villagers we met on our walks along the beach and the local roads were extremely friendly. It was such a lovely place that we stayed five days - twice as long as we intended.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR340364665", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Englishtravelfanatic"}, {"Content": "Rat dans la chambre !!!   showReview(21654653, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR972241227", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "hagy"}, {"Content": "Relaxing pur!   showReview(19290062, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR914977692", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "StinaCologne"}, {"Content": "Rate includes rat!   showReview(18015305, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR191563993", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "pinoalfano"}, {"Content": "H\u4e48tel fabuleux   showReview(13736350, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR558759768", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fabTrielSurSeine"}, {"Content": "un r\u951ave!       la piscine", "Date": "Oct 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR766995510", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "parisbali_26"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608493-d677025-r18723350-Pondok_Sari_Beach_Bungalow_Resort_Spa-Pemuteran_Bali.html", "HotelID": "677025", "Price": "$85"}}
