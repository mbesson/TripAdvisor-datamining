Disgraceful\u201d", "Author": "Lisa F", "ReviewID": "UR128324591", "Content": "I travel to Italy,Venice and many other resorts worldwide many times a year and have eaten in some of the finest restaurants. Last September we decided to try the Hotel Cipriani, my partner having been there some 20 years before having a very positive experience.We use trip advisor a lot and it is usually very accurate - Not on this occasion I can assure you. One of the most disappointing experiences and meals I have ever had. We booked a table for dinner overlooking the wonderful lagoon. In terms of location you couldn't ask for better. The private boat driver was courteous and the bar drinks and snacks were good. However this service did not extend to the restaurant. We ordered two starters and two main courses with a lovely bottle of wine. The starters were mediocre to say the least. Just as we put our cutlery down the main course had arrived. When we expressed disappointment that it had arrived so quickly with no break the waiter replied \"you should have told us if you wanted to eat slowly\". They took the main courses back and some 15 minutes brought it back to the table, having obviously been reheated! Disgraceful. Rice had become a complete blob with overcooked fish. To try and mask this they had poured melted butter to separate the rice grains. This was then inedible and certainly not what you would expect from a quality hotel/restaurant. When we complained to the waiter we were met with discourtesy and rudeness saying essentially that it was \"the cipriani hotel and they had a good reputation\". I would argue that the Cipriani was very good in its day - but it has become over confident and mediocre. I suspect that it will continue to have customers based on location rather than quality of food. It needs to come up with the times. I would be extremely surprised if they had many return guests.Unfortunately due to the number of visitors to Venice, particularly from America they will always turn over a reasonable amount. An extremely disappointing, overpriced, pompous resort that needs to buck up its ideas and treat its customers with more courtesy. It is such a shame as the location is wonderful. If you could move Osteria Santa Marina, which is a wonderful restaurant there you would have perfection. I will never return and I will ensure that my friends and family are not subjected to the same experience.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "FRANCE", "Title": "\u201cThe Italian luxury\u201d", "Author": "PIXSQUARED", "ReviewID": "UR128312164", "Content": "Venise is one of my favorite place on the planet.

One nagging thought was always the price. Venice is expensive, but the Cip raised its room rates to the almost ludicrous level. More particularly was its location on the Guidecca. One had to take its launch or a vaproetta to get there. I loved walking out of the Luna or Bauer, or Europa and being right in the flow. For me even the Gritti was a bridge too far. Thjn last year I tried it and I am now a convert. Sitting at its new less formal Cip's Club watching night fall and the stars shine over the Venice's fabled skyline is such a special treat. And our room #38 matched the fabulous view and food at Cip's Club. Our on patio, hot tub and a beutiful view back onto the water, was a treat to luxuriate in. The service was impeccable and all the facilities in good repair (something not always easy to do in Venice). Sitting by the pool for lunch or a late afternoon sun when St Mark's was too hot and cowded was a pleasant break and did not make me feel like I was escaping wasting my precious time in Venice in an equally precious place.

Service in the restaurants are a bit hit and miss but generally ok if you ask to speak with the restaurant manager as it then gets sorted out pretty quickly. Just be aware that you are not near where all the main attractions in Venice are so it's always a bit of a traipse getting about the sights even with the hotel boat.

Restaurant guests waiting at the door, ignored for over 5 mins to be seated, other guests topping up their own wine and water and starter plates left for over 15 minutes. No leadership or direction - in short an utter shambles.

Luggage arrived moments later whilst we relaxed on one of 2 terraces with our complimentary wine and nibbles. The suite itself consisted of a sitting room with its own bar area and crystal glasses, a desk and very comfortable furniture and plenty of reading lamps. The bedroom was very large, the bed was huge and very comfortable and this led to a dressing area, huge and very powerful shower, bath and vanity units. and a separate toilet. Again plenty of room in the bathroom for 2 to not fall over each other. Lots of lovely bits and pieces - Molton Brown and Bvalgari - again nothing else you could need. The Cipriani is on an island opposite St Marks Square and has its own boat which is available 24 hours a day on demand.. They have their own mooring at the front of St Marks Square and if you arrive there and the boat isn't there you just lift up the phone and ask for it, its then sent over for you (5 to 10 mins) straight away. There is always someone to help you get off the boat at the other end. Breakfasts are taken in the garden overlooking the lagoon, or in your room for no extra charge if you want, and there is an enormous amount of choice. After only one breakfast we were greeted as regulars each time we appeared and how we liked our coffee etc was remembered! We also had dinner one evening here and the ambience is so peaceful and welcoming, the views fantastic and the staff service friendly and impeccable. The hotel has its own large pool ( a luxury in Venice) with very attentive and helpful staff and service for drinks etc here is very quick.

Our children were given VIP treatment, allowed to blow glass and then each given a small blue glass horse. I doubt that much if any of the glass displayed in the showroom is actually manufactured where this demonstration took place, which I suspect is just set up for tourists. We were then taken to a very special showroom full of high value items none of which are prices up....and given full-on attention. The glass items lovely.....huge glass horses/chandeliers/ art made of glass etc. The Murano showroom service was superb, they brought our tired and thirsty children water during the hours this took (in fact we did not see the light of day for hours).

My husband says that only obnoxious people write reviews, I want to believe we write to help others make up their minds. My husband took me there on our 8th wedding anniversary and since I have never been to venice, he wanted to make it special and for special he guessed nothing beats the Cipriani.. We stayed for 4 nights at a suite on the palazzo side, right in front of the Piazza, everyday we had Venice right in front of us like in a movie. But now that I have already being to Venice and to The Cipriani I will not go back there. Reasons: Cipriani asks you to fork out an incredible amount of money for a suite and a compulsory half board,,, which we did not use and would not use. The suite is rather small and while the furnishing is sort of (faux) classical it could have done with some updating, specially the sofas. Also in most suites these days you see some appliances, nothing here. The location: if you want to explore venice, the romantic crossing becomes a hassle and if the weather is not nice, like one of the days we were there, then it means you do not have time to go back, shower and leave again. The food: we were not tempted to eat there based on their breakfast being so poor in terms of choice, the coffee was really bad, croissants dry, etc etc. I eat frugally at bfast but even here my frugality was impaired by the little choice. One day I ordered eggs and they were bad. We ate at some amazing places in Venice, after all, it is famous for its food. Spa: We had their signature massage there, again, nothing special (for almost E500). Service also was below par. We had made 2 reservations - which they confirmed beforehand- and while there they told us they did not know anything about them. So my husband, who speaks perfect italian, call the places himself and book. A few other things also happened but i will not bother you.

We had an absolutely fantastic time, and although we realise the hotel is a lot of money - so \"value\" doesn't really come into the equation - we can't understand what so many of these negative reviews are complaining about. We arrived late one night having been greeted at the airport by a water taxi booked via the hotel. Despite it being almost midnight when we arrived, we were greeted off the boat by the concierge and shown to our fantastic Lagoon View room. Certainly no complaints about the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size, and the balcony ran the length of the room with a great view of the lagoon.

On the good side, it's quite different from the other main hotels in that, since it's located on Giudecca Island, it has the space to include quiet gardens and a huge swimming pool. (Note incidentally that many guide books and web sites call the island \"Guidecca\" and people therefore often pronounce it \"guy-deck-a\"; the people who live there, who ought to know, spell it \"Giudecca\" and pronounce it \"jew-deck-a\". Go look to see how reliable your reference site is!). The location is not a problem, indeed it's on balance an advantage. The hotel provides a shuttle boat service to St Mark's Square and the most you have to wait if you just miss the boat is 20 minutes. The shuttle boat is itself a delight (one of the beautiful polished wood variety, comfortable and indeed luxurious; so you get a free boat trip each time you move between the Square and the hotel). And whilst in the hotel you are in a separate world from the hurly burly of mainstream tourist Venice. The rooms are, like so many in Venetian hotels, mainly rather small. Not a problem if you want to spend your time being a tourist, but a major problem if you want \"holiday time\" in your room. By most people's standards this appears a good luxury hotel; by the standards of people who prefer the 5 star range it's pretty poor value with occasionally bad service. To achieve a reasonable (reasonable by non-Venice standards) room size one needs a luxury suite and thus a huge bank balance - Cipriani prices are high - very very high. One is looking at over \u00c2\u00a3500 a night for a pokey little room and around \u00c2\u00a35,000 a night for more luxurious space. Not unreasonable prices perhaps if one obtains incomparable service but unfortunately while half the staff are wonderful, half are hopeless; whether you have a good experience or not will I guess depend on the nature of your problem and whether it's handled by one of the good ones or one of the \"couldn't care\" bad ones. A situation one meets in many hotels, but at lower cost. An example of what can make this feel a poor hotel: a four night stay; day 1 was a sunny morning and tables were laid up outside on the terrace and we breakfasted royally. Day 2 was sunny but no tables set up outside; we asked to eat outside and a table was quickly laid (and followed by others). Day 3 was sunny and we asked to eat outside and were told \"No - it's too cold\"! Personally I prefer to make my own judgements on whether it's too cold for me to eat outside. The waiter refused to lay up a table; a major fuss (and \"major\" meant insisting on the individual's manager being called, then that manager's manager through three layers of management) before we achieved, from resentful staff, our fresh air breakfast. But boy were they unhappy about it; most good hotel staff will bend over backwards to meet their guests' reasonable requests but this lot were focussed on their own priorities - an attitude difference which sets a good hotel apart from a bad hotel. On other occasions (including the first two breakfasts) one could not fault the restaurant staff - it just depends whether one is lucky enough to have a sensible soul helping one or a set of muppets. But at these prices one would expect the management to have got rid of the muppets and got rid of the occasional staff member who (fairly obviously) couldn't care less about guests. I went as a reconnaissance for a major party event with the firm and confident intention of basing the (six figure budget) party at the hotel; I left with the very firm intention of basing it elsewhere. My booking was cocked up (a confirmed-in-writing suite with balcony had no balcony), a promised water-taxi didn't arrive when needed and we endured the ghastly breakfast fiasco - the failures were enough to kill any thoughts of letting these people handle a key event. But seasoned travellers will know that it's quite possible for one person to endure a nightmare while another has a dream; hotels are like that. Would I recommend it to a friend? No; it's ludicrously over-priced for what it is. If you're a pop star and you need to keep the fans away and money's no object it would be fine. If you need to show off and persuade people you're somehow special and money's no object you'll be fine (though not too many people will notice you, Venice itself commands most people's attention). If you want an hotel with gardens and a pool don't go to Venice, you can get hugely better facilities and value elsewhere. If you want a comfortable luxury hotel as a base to visit Venice then go for Gritti Palace or Bauer or Danieli or your other choice of 5 star hotel; you'll get comfort and luxury at about half the price and your morning starting point will be the same as Cipriani's - right by St Mark's Square - and all you'll miss is the short boat ride. (Save on the hotel bill and with a very small part of the saving you'll be able to have a taxi ride or two each day). If you just want to feel superior and feel that you're better than the poor peasants, don't go to Venice, spend the money on counselling. Much of the Cipriani's reputation is based on the celebrities who've stayed there; for them a major benefit is the privacy of being away from the crowd whilst at the same time being \"seen\" to stay at the most expensive hotel. If you're a celebrity and can afford it then stay at the Ciptiani and get counselling. If you do decide it's worth it going to the Cipriani then try to get lucky and avoid the muppet staff, whom it would be invidious to name. But at dinner or breakfast if you bump into Mariana you'll be delighted (she's one of the good ones); at the jetty when arriving or waiting for the shuttle if you bump into Roberto you'll be delighted (he's the other good one!). If you decide against the Cipriani and you go for one of the other 5 stars you'll probably have a wonderful time (although that's not guaranteed). What is guaranteed is that you'll have a hugely bigger budget to spend on food, drink, private taxis and presents!", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cFaded luxury - but in a good way\u201d", "Author": "DiMo", "ReviewID": "UR46029013", "Content": "There's something more than a little dated about the Cipriani - whether it's the 70's style of the bedrooms and open spaces, or the other guests....However that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Best decision i have made in a long while! Considering i was spending 3 times as much as a comparible room at the Gritti Palace i was expecting something really special. The launch to the hotel is shinny;the welcome was cordial but the hotel was just plain ordinary. We were upgraded to a suite which was beautiful but so it should be at just short of \u00c2\u00a32,000 per night!!!! This is silly money. The hotel is like a decent 3/4 star Mediterranean hotel nothing special. The grounds are disappointing which was a shame as i had to hastly rethink where i was going to propose to my girlfriend. (Outside St Marks at 1am was my late venue change). The pool is indeed splendid and much welcome after a hot day in Venice. The Bellini were dreadful. The Fortuny restaurant was not as elegant as it would like it to be thought it was and as it poured with rain we were faced with the rather dated interior of the restaurant which we eschewed for the much nicer (and much more pleasant and helpful head waiter) Cips which overlooks St Marks. Much more romantic though again at around \u00c2\u00a3250 for dinner for 2 (which would cost half that in a top restaurant in London) one was left wondering was the experience that special. Whilst waiting for our table in the Fortuny restaurant we waited in the Bar next to it. No sooner seated were we informed that the Bar at 9.30pm was closing and we had to go elsewhere. To be fair the head waiter gave the young barman a talking to and we stayed but at this level we could buy the bar! So what are the upsides to the hotel. Not many. The launch was nice and romantic to summon it as 1am to cross over the lagoon to propose to my girlfriend. It is nice to escape to a pool on a hot summer's day with Venice so close. The rooms are beautiful but that i am afraid is that. Overall one is left with the sad feeling that one has been robbed. To pay \u00c2\u00a32,000 per night you expect something extraordinary. You dont get that. The Gritti is a third of the price and much more authentic and easier for sight seeing. I had been told the hotel launch would take you to the airport. Wrong. A water taxi takes you there which costs twice as much as if you had gone to St Marks and hailed it yourself! Even as we left one was left with a bad taste.

Everywhere else we stayed people went out of there way to make us feel welcome and comfortable but the Cipriani was a very disapointing last stop. Our group had 4 suits booked together but when we arrived we were told that one of the rooms was in a different building. We said we'd like to be close to my parents and my sister would like the other building. The reception very bluntly said \"no\" and took us to the far away room. As we walked we were told the hotel rules, Children are not allowed in the fitness center (as with most hotels,this makes sense for safety but I didn't think we really needed to be told in that way) Children are not allowed in the business center and if my son askes to use the internet he will be told no ( I really doubt my baby would be asking to use the internet) Children are not allowed in one restaurant and are only allowed in the other for dinner between 7:30 and 9 and are only allowed in the pool during certain hours. I felt like we were getting a lecture of all the things children are not allowed to do rather than being told about the services of the hotel. The room itself had a nice balcony with a private hot tub but it was very dated and dark with stained pink carpet and duct tape holding the tv cabinet together. At 7;45 we tried to go for dinner but were told that children are not allowed in after 7:30. We tried to order room service but were told he was busy with another room and he'd call us back. He did call back 35 minutes later and when the food came an hour after that it was okay. Since there are not many choices of places to eat without taking a boat we ordered room service 3 times during our stay and every time we had to wait to be called back and 2 out of the 3 times they forgot part of our order. The low point of our stay was the next afternoon when our group were the only ones in the restaurant and I was discreetly nursing my son. The waited asked if I wanted to \"do that inside\" I replied no thanks we're fine here and he huffed \"I ment for the other guests\" What guests? we were the only ones in there. He then proceded to walk around the table opening and handing menus to everyone,but when he got to me he literelly threw it at me. I realize that some people are just not comfortable with nursing in public but I don't think anyone deserves to have a menu thrown at them under any circumstances! I wish I had complained right there but I was so tired of being treated like we were not welcome there,I was trying not to cry and I still had to feed my hungry baby so my husband, son and I just left. We were there for 4 days and aside from one friendly housekeeper not one staff member said hello or even smiled at us. The bad service and disorganization contiuned the day were leaving. We got a call early in the morning saying we needed to check out now or we wouldn't make our flight. We explained that our flight wasn't until 5 and we had been gauranteed a late check out through American Express. At 9 we got another call saying the same thing., we explained again but got yet another call asking what time we would be leaving, we said 1:15 and asked to have help with our luggage.At 1:25 no one had come so we called to see if they were coming and were told they were busy and would be there soon. We needed to catch our transfer to the airport and were heading down the stairs with our luggage ourselves when they did finally show up at around 1:40. We were so glad to leave! I don't know if we would have been treated differently if my son had not been with us but if a hotel doesn't want kids there they should state that so families can stay somewhere else.", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cIn the future I'm going not going to stay there anymore\u201d", "Author": "RosiS", "ReviewID": "UR18605843", "Content": "The only thing I liked there is the location of the hotel.

The next day we were offered the choice of staying in the Palazzo or returning to the Palazetto. We chose the latter. The handling of the event with ablomb and grace was indicative of the level of service and concern that this hotel shows its guests. The remainder of our stay was magical- delightful dinner at Cip's Club with excellent polla ala diavolo, great lunch at Gabbiano by the pool, an excursion for some golf on the Lido, and just the joy of the trips to and from Bassano San Marco on the hotel's launch. We had drinks at the bar one evening to find George Clooney present being showered with gifts from his entourage. But every one of the hotel guests was discreet and never bothered him. This is the place to go and relax- sit by the pool if the mood strikes you, or walk along the canal for some gelato in the afternoon, and the major attractions of Venice are a glorious brief boat ride away.

From the moment we boarded the private launch(free at all times-and runs 24 hours a day) from San Marco ~ Guidecca to the moment we left it was absolutely fantastic. The accommodation standards were extremely high, the suite had a large main bedroom with motorised retractable 40\"LCD TV at foot of bed, large sitting room with secondary LCD, and very large bathroom again with LCD TV built into wall of bathroom. The Pool area is an oasis- a 25 metre saltwater pool for relaxation after a day in Venice, and there's a nice pool bar overlooking the lagoon, the gardens are very typical and there are vines which supply grapes for the local wine. We dined at Chips club twice, which is a lovely romantic location overlooking the lagoon, food quality is high. Breakfasts are the best I have had at any hotel!

We have stayed at top hotels all over the world and have been to Venice 8 times, so we do not have unrealistic expectations, here is a quick summary of what we found. We booked a Junior suite for the night, which at 1600 euros a night you ought to expect a reasonable standard of accomodation, even in expensive Venice. The hallway to the room was a long dark corridor, done floor to ceiling in sponged peach circa 1980 something, with peach carpet which had that sticky feeling you get from carpets so old no amount of cleaning can remove the gunge. The room was at the back of the hotel, overlooking a patchy muddy lawn and motheaten hedge with a dirty white plastic wedding marquee left standing in it permanently (the garden). The bathroom had the same plastic bath your grandmother has in her bungalow (peach with handles to pull yourself up if your knees are bad), a square box hairdryer which I last saw in a municipal pool in the 1970s, with the squeegy air tube ripped and broken, a vanity mirror with rust stains around the edge and every time I hung the towel up it fell into the toilet below. The toiletries were ancient looking and were probably used last by Agatha Christie to talc her bloomers. I then asked very firmly but politely to be moved to another room. We were given apologies (eventually) and told that the hotel was \"in the process of being refurbished\" and shown another room. This was tastefully furnished, had a private terrace on the roof above with a panoramic view of the Grand Canal to die for and a large bathroom, it was just what we thought we should have been given in the first place. When I booked the room I was told we couldn't request a particular room. When we left I asked if we could have the nice room again and were told that they always try to accomodate repeat customers. So, if its your first and only time, beware, and don't let them fob you off with the stale fag end of the hotel. On the plus side (!) the staff had a proper old fashioned polite and accomodating at your service ethic, attentive without being intrusive, the pool was pure Hollywood gorgeousness and the breakfast room with ripples of water reflected on the ceiling as you gaze straight out over the canal was magic. So don't expect faded glory charm, its too tired to even achieve that, but if you can put up with the feeling that Farah Fawcett is likely to come bounding out of the fake white trellis in the wine bar, it does grows on you and I have to say I would stay there again, albeit in the knowledge there are some better rooms than others.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cSuper romantic\u201d", "Author": "Wereldreizigster", "ReviewID": "UR11213173", "Content": "We had a lovely suite in Palazzo Vendramin with a little garden and a kitchen..

To these observations, I add my recommendation that you book a suite rather than one of the standard rooms because the suites, though more expensive, represent, by all accounts, a better value because they are so much nicer than the standards. Ours was actually a large apartment steps from the pool where we found our reserved lounge chairs - a decadent treat. Generally, the property lives up to its legendary reputation: The pool is the best in the world - Olympic-size, nearly empty, filtered salt water heated during our stay to 86 degrees fahrenheit. The food is flawless. The atmosphere is blissfully quiet and the grounds spacious (for central Venice!) and perfectly manicured. Small quibbles: the bed linens were scratchy and somewhat worn, though absolutely clean (as was everything else). The single-ply toilet paper was also a down-market touch, though perhaps a result of a plumbing system which might not handle anything more substantial.

No further description is necessary, as the Cipriani has been well described by other reviewers. Suffice to say it does deserve a high rating but not 5 stars for the following reason. Beware of the concierge desk. We asked advice about where we should go to see genuine glass blowing and the production of Murano glass. We were told that they [the hotel] could organise exactly what we were after. 10:00 the next morning was the agreed departure time.

This set the first alarm bell ringing. We had a lovely trip up through the back canals and then across to Murano. We arrived at the private jetty of the Cam s.r.l. glass works and were greeted effusively by a well-suited member of staff. The next 10 minutes were what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hoped for. We were shown around a modest gritty production area where 4 guys were making vases and pieces for chandeliers. We saw glass blowing and were able to appreciate the skill & techniques involved. We were not permitted to linger though and were rushed off to the next section of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. A louder alarm bell began to clang. What then followed was the worst 50 minutes of highly polished hard sell we have ever experienced. We were lead through seven or eight sales rooms chock full of every imaginable object in glass. We were put under extreme pressure to buy a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfamily heirloom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at massively bloated prices.

When it became clear to our guide that we were not interested in parting with excessive amounts of money for a piece of Murano glass his attitude became rude and dismissive, and we were made to feel most uncomfortable. We declined the return launch. Back at the Cipriani we complained vociferously at the manner in which we had been treated. We had asked for a simple recommendation that had resulted in a most unpleasant time so we pressed the manager to investigate what his staff were recommending and why.

I completely recommend the hotel. BUT - you need to go in the right frame of mind.

The compensation is that you leave feeling you have had a unique experience. Increasingly difficult in the world of Four Seasons. I would not stay anywhere else in Venice if you are up for the price. I personally don't see the attraction of being in the centre of the City when you can cross the lagoon from the Cipriani in 10 minutes. The other 5* hotels (mostly a Starwood clique) are cheaper but the Cipriani is better value. Other points. Breakfast is great - especially if you sit outside. Dinner in the restaurant is disappointing plus they have a jacket and tie dress code which is annoyingly not enforced (better not to have it - so irritating to have to put on a tie and then see that everyone else can ignore it).

It did meet all our expectations. We had booked the \"venetian interlude\" package direct with the hotel which includes a junior suite, breakfast plus one other meal of your choice each day, plus a beauty treatment. Our room on the third floor had a terrace and overlooked the lagoon which was lovely. Marble bathroom with 2 sinks, standard size bath and a wonderful walk- in shower. We had dinner at the formal restaurant and at the Cips, and had lunch at the pool side restaurant. The food at all of these restaurants was very good indeed. The service is professional and friendly without being stuffy or indifferent. For a total cost of 130 euros, the hotel arranged for us to be met at the airport on arrival, driven to the watertaxi stand and taken by a private watertaxi direct to the hotel. I know it may be cheaper to DIY but the ease of having yourself plus luggage transported for you to and into the watertaxi from the airport is, in my opinion, an amount worth spending (especially if you have heavy/bulky luggage) The beauty treatments were excellent and lovely to have after a day of walking around and sightseeing. The outdoor heated swimming pool is wonderful and fortunately we had some great weather so we could enjoy swimming and lounging. Some of the suites have loungers specifically allocated to them - but if you are not in one of these suites, the pool attendant is more than happy to move unreserved loungers to wherever you want them around the pool. I would definitely recommend this hotel . Yes it is expensive and so not worth going to if you are going to faint at the price of a gin and tonic (24 euros by the way). Only one thing I would suggest to anyone going there and planning to have dinner in CIPs. We had intended eating at CIPs the first night and the formal restaurant the second night (which was our wedding anniversary). It was raining on the first day/night, however, and when we arrived we were told that the earliest we could have dinner in the CIPS restaurant would be 9-9.30pm. As we had been up since 4am we didn't want to eat that late. The restaurant could not accommodate us any earlier as the outside terrace was not open on account of the weather and the inside part of the restaurant was already fully booked. In the end we swapped over and ate in the formal restaurant the first night instead which was able to accommodate us at 8pm. So it was not a problem for us. However, if you are planning to dine on the first night you arrive and are specific about when you want to eat - you may want to contact the hotel in advance to reserve a table at a specific time.

I had to keep pinching myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. all the top hotels in Europe are expensive, especially with the dollar against the euro. this is one of those hotels to splurge on - it will be a peak experience that you will cherish for your entire life. we can't wait to go back!", "Date": "December 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cspectacular\u201d", "Author": "just up and go", "ReviewID": "UR4000132", "Content": "I stayed at the Cipriani in early September and it was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life. The room was lovely and overlooked the lagoon, the pool was spectacular (I had no problem with attitude; some of the chairs were reserved but that was about it), the staff courteous, friendly and efficient and the food amazing. I agree that Cip's Club is the better of the two restaurants for dinner, but they were both excellent. The breakfast is one of the best I've ever had. Best of all is the fact that the Cipriani is a short boat ride away from the huge crowds in St. Mark's Square. It is such a lovely respite from the hordes of cruise ship tourists that are discharged every day. Yes, it is expensive, but it was worth every penny.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular setting, but the poolside attitude!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3981487", "Content": "I was dismayed on a very hot, busy day at the poolside, when asking the steward for a sun lounger and noticing empty loungers without towels, to be told \"oh no, what is your room number?
