In many ways, whether or not to stay at this hotel should be a simple matter of taste. Do you want to step out of your hotel tower straight into the activity and retail mayhem of Orchard Road, or do you want the peace of a low-rise colonial building set atop a hill surrounded by glorious rainforest? If your preference is the latter, this hotel SHOULD fit the bill. But for every plus at this place, there's a minus to cancel it out. Probably easiest to list: LOCATION: May be the greatest strength of this hotel and its biggest weakness. Early morning walks under the forest canopy of Fort Canning are a stunning way to start the day, especially when followed by a swim in one of the hotel's two impressive pools and breakfast. BUT leaving this oasis is a bit of an ordeal. To reach the shops (or business centres) one must either get a taxi (they are relatively cheap) or walk down many steps, cross a couple of roads and go through a shopping centre carpark to get to Dhoby Ghaut interchange, where trains are fast, clean and ruthlessly efficient. While the hotel is a haven to return to at the end of the day, walking back up the precipitous stairs in the equatorial heat after a shopping spree is exhausting. Few taxi drivers know the hotel. ROOMS: Developers have done a nice(ish) job transforming this one-time country club, but the design of the rooms -- certainly the deluxe ones -- while admirably quirky, was the source of our greatest irritation. The location and configuration of the bathrooms is ridiculous. Situated against the only window, the prospect of a bath with a view initially feels inviting until you realise that all of Singapore can see you too. With no mirror over the basin, like the previous reviewer, my husband had to stand in, or lean over, the big bath to shave. Having to lower blinds -- very slowly as they're motorised -- every time somebody wants to pee let alone shower gets very annoying, especially as the rest of the room is plunged into darkness. It is probably the major fault with this place. (On a very minor note, one small bar of soap to cover three wet areas is not enough, nor does it make sense to have the tissues on a desk at the other end of the guest room. The hairdryer is not top quality.) Our bed was curiously located in the centre of the room with a desk and the room's door behind it. The room was too narrow for bedside tables, leaving nowhere to place a morning cup of tea but on a shelf above your head. The potential problems with that are obvious. THE POOLS: Fantastic. There's a lap pool and a resort-style pool, as well as a paddling pool for toddlers. Again, on the downside, there is very little shade against the brutal heat and there is no drink/food service. It definitely lacks a 'resort' feel. In the whole time we were there, we saw three other people using the pools. Most of the time we had them to ourselves. BREAKFAST: I see others have been impressed by the breakfast, but by south-east Asian hotel standards, we found it pretty dull and very limited. There is something for everybody, i.e. a nod to Chinese/Japanese/Indian/European but very, very few options within each category and they never change (this was probably more irritating over a week, than it would be for shorter stays). If there were gluten-free options available, it was purely an accident. COMPLIMENTARY DRINKS: This is a lovely touch every evening at 6.00. SERVICE: Two requests -- one to move to a more conventionally laid-out room (most of them are, aside from the bathroom factor) and a late check-out -- were both refused on the basis that the hotel was full. This may have been true, but there was little evidence of a full house. BOTTOM LINE: For a peaceful Singapore stay, this hotel should be a no-brainer but until management fixes some huge flaws -- the lack of opaque window coverings, some strangely configured rooms and a sterile pool environment -- I would suggest staying somewhere else.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cPromising, but recommend avoiding until management fixes several basics.\u201d", "Author": "xtnjohnson", "ReviewID": "UR127900761", "Content": "This is one of the more difficult reviews for me to write, because there was so much that we liked about the Hotel Fort Canning -- and so much that really, really annoyed us. Until management addresses the shortcomings I can\u2019t recommend staying there. But once it does, the hotel promises to be a great addition to Singapore\u2019s lodging options. I'll start with the less-good qualities -- I'd prefer to end on a more upbeat note, and the problems are fixable. The central issue with this hotel is that it is located in a heritage building, a factor that inevitably requires design compromises. One of them is noticeable as soon as you walk in the front door: there's no hint of a lobby. Instead, two large staircases confront the guest, masking a bar. It turns out the lobby is located to the left, slightly behind the staircases. Improved signage would help immeasurably, as we wandered around with our bags behind us, wondering where to check in. But by far the more serious problem is the unfortunate choice guests in rooms facing Ft. Canning Park must make: would you like privacy, or natural light? You may not have both. I was appalled that a hotel of this calibre would put guests in this position. I would not stay there again until management resolves the issue by installing appropriate sheers. The conundrum results from the interplay of several layout decisions that the designers made, and appear not to have thought entirely through. First, each room has dramatic, floor-to-ceiling windows, executed in completely transparent glass (I suspect a more reflective glass was not possible because of the building's preservation status). Second, the floorplan places the bathroom right next to the windows. Thus, as my first photograph shows, our third-floor room directly faced a walking path in the park -- and indeed, we confirmed that from the path you could see our room's toilet very clearly. The only option for room privacy is to use the room's elaborate series of motorized shades. But, as our second photo shows, that means completely blocking natural light, defeating one of the room's chief design advantages. Adding a layer of sheers would solve the issue beautifully, and would not be that difficult. With those in place, the rooms would be really pleasant. But there\u2019s another urgent problem, too. In those first two photos (of the bathroom and shades), take a look at the sink. What's missing behind it? A mirror. A mirror! How on earth can any competent hotel designer forget to put a mirror behind the sink? Instead, there\u2019s a whole wall of mirror next to the bathtub, where it\u2019s completely irrelevant. So how is any male guest supposed to shave? We found a tiny, useless makeup mirror in the bedroom. At my 6\u20192\u201d height, leaving the mirror on its stand was not an option \u2013 it was still about 2 feet from my eyes. I like not slashing myself up when I shave, so that left two choices: 1) Hold the mirror in one hand while shaving. Wish you had a third hand for those spots where normally you'd use your second hand to tighten your skin. 2) Stand in the bathtub to shave. Hope you don't trip going back to the sink to rinse your razor. (This is the option I chose.) For what this hotel charges, guests should not be standing a bathtub to shave. Since the obvious answer \u2013 reversing the positions of the bathtub and sink \u2013 is probably too difficult, the addition of a proper-sized mirror behind the sink would seem the right answer. The third problem with the bedrooms is the lighting. Not the lights themselves, but the monstrously overcomplicated device for controlling them. Instead of providing switches for particular sets of lights \u2013 e.g. switch A for the lights above the bed, switch B for those in the soffit, etc. \u2013 the controller provides an utterly impenetrable series of pre-programmed \u201cmoods\u201d, forcing the user to scroll through about half-a-dozen permutations and combinations before finally getting the preferred option. This is an excellent way to wake a drowsy spouse up when all you wanted to do was cut all the lights save the reading light. That\u2019s a lot of stuff we didn\u2019t like. But here are also wonderful things about the hotel that would make it a great choice, once these very basic problems are solved. The first is indeed that it\u2019s a heritage building \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful to see an old building find a new use. The second is the location. Although not all taxi drivers know where the hotel is (it\u2019s easy to get confused by the signage coming up the driveway), the site is actually very convenient \u2013 just a short walk to the Quays or to the MRT interchange at Dhoby Ghaut. Third, we thought the hotel\u2019s isolation was a great advantage; couldn\u2019t ask for a quieter environment. Advantage four is the pools; the lap pool is actually long enough for distance swimming, and the play-pool gets to about 5\u2019/1.7m deep. Fifth, breakfast in the Glass House every morning was a treat \u2013 the spread itself was fairly standard, but the environment was relaxing. And sixth, the staff were really helpful. So despite the problems, the hotel has a lot going for it. But it needs to get the basics right before it\u2019s worth staying there.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!\u201d", "Author": "coco55555", "ReviewID": "UR127149969", "Content": "I thought this hotel was just fantastic!

The staff were very freindly and helpful all through our stay and we had confidence that they were always at hand if we had any problems. We arrived early and they were fabulous in getting us a room after a short wait. We relaxed at the pool for a couple of hours and were quite happy there, even in the rain. The poolside furniture is of a high quality and you couldn't ask for a better setting. It is the best pool we have seen in Singapore. Our room was delightful. The original balcony had been enclosed and remodelled into the bathroom, very quirky but it works well. The room was spacious and the height of the walls are magnificant. The bed was extra comfortable and the room as a whole must have been planned by a very good designer. The coffee machine was a bonus. We ordered room service one night and it came to us in a Tiffany set, it was a treat but not as good as the food that can be had in a Hawker Centre. The complimentary early evening drinks were enjoyable and although the lounge area is rather small, everyone would spread out to the adjacent outdoor area making it a very pleasant place to be. The snacks were not spectacular as they had very little available. As they only serve wine to the guests they would be far better to just concentrate on providing a wider range of cheeses with crackers. Another suggestion would be to have a small snack menu for guests to order from. We were concerned about the location but found this to be no problem at all once we found the easy route in and out, there was very little climbing. There are two seperate lifts, one that serves the basement floors and hence the car park and another on the other side that takes you to your room. Once we got to the ground floor we would walk across to the car park lifts and take this to the car park and walk through the nearby car park mall, take the lifts there and the train station was just across the road. The location of the Hotel is great and you feel the atmosphere of the park, we spent most of the day exploring Canning Park, it was very enjoyable and a great way to start our vacation. A previous reviewer suggested to ask for a room with a city view as the rooms were brighter and although I was doubtful we did do this and soon found that it was definately the best choice. One side of the Hotel (the parkview) faces a high wall which both blocks any views and sunlight. Our breakfast at the Glasshouse was a real treat. It is in a building seperate to the Hotel and again very modern but sophisticated. The choice was not huge but the quality was excellant and very much made up for this.

We have been to Singapore before and wanted a hotel that would be something of an oasis, with spa-like facilities, but easily accessible and close to the MRT rapid transit system. The hotel is lovely, a recent renovation of a historic building in a lush park in the center of the city. Unfortunately, there was no warning that it is halfway up a hill. The advertised 8-minute walk to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station is accurate, but the excursion involves walking out the back door of the hotel, across a veranda, down 2 floors on an elevator, walking through a parking garage, down a hill, across a busy street, through another parking garage, down 4 floors on another elevator, and across another busy street. This through the constant heat and humidity, and frequent rain. It\u2019s quite a disincentive to step out for a quick bite or a beer. Many other central hotels in Singapore are connected to the MRT via underground malls. So, if you want to be in an isolated oasis, this hotel might work, but if you expect to be in and out a lot as you seek out hawker centers and shopping stalls, this hotel is not for you. Check-in and check-out were both problematic. Our room was pre-paid, so checking in should have been easy. However, the front desk was manned by one overwhelmed, disoriented young fellow who didn\u2019t acknowledge our presence for several minutes as he dealt with another hotel employee. When he finally turned to us, he was interrupted twice more and disappeared at one point for several minutes. Check-in took 20 minutes. The night before our departure, I checked with the front desk regarding arranging for a cab (cabs don\u2019t line up at the hotel but have to be called for in advance). I was assured that a simple call in the morning five minutes before departure would be sufficient. I was specific about our 6 AM departure time. The next morning, however, the person on duty said that it was rush hour for taxis. After she spent 20 minutes trying to find us a cab, she sheepishly suggested that I run down to the MRT station to try to hail a cab. This I did, through the humidity, and after 10 minutes of trying I received a phone call that she had finally gotten us a cab, so I ran back up the hill. The cab driver also said that a cab should have been arranged for the night before. Luckily, he got us to the airport quickly, but it was an unnecessarily stressful departure. The hotel room itself was sleek and stylish if a little quirky. The electronic controls for the lights, shades and temperature weren\u2019t very intuitive and were in awkward locations. There was only one chair in the sitting room, although there was room for another. The desk area was quite dark. At one point there was no hot water. The duvet cover was stained and had a large hole in it. One pillowcase was covered with ink stains. The television volume on certain channels (HBO and a few others) was so low it was inaudible, and the TV volume control was governed not to let you raise above a certain level. We were told this was impossible to override \u2013 so the stations we most wanted to watch were inaudible. We had a \u201cpark view\u201d room, and if I were to stay there again, I would insist on a city view \u2013 those rooms are simultaneously brighter and more private. The pool area is quite beautiful and peaceful, surrounded by greenery that made it feel like a tropical resort rather than a city hotel. The breakfast buffet was very good, and the service was excellent, with custom-cooked eggs and pancakes daily, along with many other choices. A nightly wine and champagne reception from 6 to 8 was a nice touch, although at one point when I tried to take two glasses of champagne back up to my room I was firmly challenged by a hotel staff person. The hotel restaurants were all high-end, so we didn\u2019t try them \u2013 we were in Singapore specifically to eat at hawker centers. The hotel sits atop a pre-existing athletic and social club, and at times the lobby bar was quite noisy with corporate conference attendees. The gym is large and well-appointed, but, strangely, the locker room is one floor below. In order to get a locker key, you have to walk down a long unmarked hall a good distance from the locker room, and likewise you have to make this trek to get an extra towel, which the attendant seemed slightly reluctant to part with. At mid-day the locker room appeared to be used only by pre-adolescent boys who shrieked and horsed around. The shower area is interesting, private yet open to the outdoors, making it perpetually warm and steamy. The steam room, sauna, and Jacuzzi are in the shower area. Unfortunately the Jacuzzi was not in service \u2013 in any event we would have preferred a Jacuzzi in the pool area. If you\u2019ve read this far, you must think I\u2019m quite a hotel prima donna. Actually, my needs are simple, but having been led to expect luxury, the number of rough edges and services lapses at this hotel added up to its being quite a disappointment.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pulau Ubin, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat F&B!\u201d", "Author": "leong34", "ReviewID": "UR121448786", "Content": "Had lunch at the glasshouse recently.

The classically dressed doorman welcomed us and guided us to the reception desk. First impressions... Wow.

The reception room sweeps onto a luxurious lounge area with leather loungers available to relax on and with complimentary Nespresso Coffee, Tea, Juice & Bottled water made available to guests. The suites are a good size, with king bed and all amenities, seperate stone floor bathrooms, stand alone bath tub & wash basin, large shower with rain forrest shower head & WC.

As a Singaporean, even Fort Canning is not exactly a familiar place to me, thus I can understand if taxi drivers have a hard time finding the hotel. But after staying there, I realised how convenient it actually is! It's literally a 5 minute walk to the MRT (the hill isn't that steep), and a 10 minute walk to Clarke Quay (this I never knew till the frontdesk staff told me about the quick walk in the park that leads you there in no time). And what makes this hotel special, is that despite its good location, it is still quiet as it is located in a park rather than a busy road. The pools (2 of them) were empty most of the time so it was nice to lounge there without having to fight for chairs, or fear swimming head-on into someone, which is usually the case in big hotels. The room was modern, clean and very different from the usual carpetted rooms. The floors were parquet/marble and my room over-looked the park!

All-in-all I was very happy with the room, bar one small niggle which I'll come back to! Enough closet and draw space if you aren't travelling 'heavy', and a small desk area. The hotel is within walking distance of the heart of the city, although you will probably prefer to take a taxi, Singapore is hot and humid! Fort Canning Park is worth a very gentle walk. The hotel is not large, about 80 rooms I think, so it is run as a 'tight ship'. This means two things staffing whilst not cut to the bone is efficient. Second some of the expected things you would find in a hotel like bar and restaurant are outsourced. In general the staff were excellent, and I have no complaints at all, friendly and helpful, if occasionally you did feel they were at full stretch. The bar and restaurant, Gattopardo (see reviews on TA), are not owned by the hotel so you cannot charge them to your room. There is a hotel restaurant a short walk through the gardens. This is where breakfast is served and dinner can be ordered. There is a small bar attached. Breakfast was OK if unremarkable, I ate a couple of times here at night, fine I'd say for a snack, but the places really lacks atmosphere. I've seen motorway service stations with more ambience, and I really think they should rethink this. I guess it is likely you'll eat out more than in so I suppose it is not really a problem. The hotel has a gym (not visited) and two pools. The pools are open air and lovely. Most times I used them I had them both to myself, they sit above Singapore so you get something of a view. Wi-Fi was provided free when I was there and was fast and pretty reliable, you did seem to need to re-logon when you moved between wi-fi routers. There isn't a business centre but staff were happy to print the small document I had, take a USB key so you can do any transfers. There are complimentary drinks and snacks for residents in the early evening, very nice given the price of wine and beer generally in Singapore All in all I really rate this hotel, would recommend it and will definitely consider going back. That said a couple of small niggles: First it is slightly off the beaten track - well at least as far as taxi drivers are concerned - so there may not be an immediate recognition when you hop in a cab, and you may need to provide guidance (usually 'into park and up the hill works'). In fairness I often found taxi drivers seemed to know little about any location in Singapore so this may not be a problem specific to this hotel! It does mean you will more often than not have to order a taxi, allow at least five minutes, and it does attract a small surcharge! Second for a hotel that seem to be obsessed with mirrors - I calculated about 5 square metres of them in my room - the bathrooms come without a usable mirror above the sink! Shaving was a real chore. I would also say that the bathroom whilst wonderful in may ways has minimal worktop space. I travel pretty light, my partner doesn't. If we had been travelling together I can see she and I would have come to blows over who got to put their things out! These small things aside a thoroughly lovely hotel. One final tip, I found going via TA or direct to the hotel website got me much better room rates than going directly to one of the hotel portals. The rate I got direct from hotel made this a very good value stay.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTerrible stay at Hotel Fort Canning Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Jason L", "ReviewID": "UR119106791", "Content": "Terrible experience!

When we disagreed to pay twice, they threatened us with calling the police and said that if they couldn't get the money from the agent, they would make their staff pay.

The hotel opened in November 2010, and sometimes it seemed as if it is still working out some kinks. Its unique attributes usually present a trade-off: 1. Located in a public park surrounded by trees and hills. Pluses: Clean and green location with interesting walking paths, dog-walkers, and nearby attractions such as Battle Box; free strong-signal wi-fi throughout the stand-alone hotel building; can be quiet and relaxing. Minuses: Popular location for \"retreat\" style wedding and other mobs that often dominate the main thoroughfare of the stairs lobby and the main restaurant (there is a separate lobby/reception area for guests). Gattopardo Restaurant serves mass meals so that some nights a guest could not get a reservation until 9:30. Taxis take wrong road near hotel entrance and come back because entry road in the park lacks adequate signage. Extra cost of remoteness includes having to wait 5 minutes and paying extra S$3-5 surcharge for calling a taxi. But you can walk downhill to the taxi stand in Park Place about 10 minutes away. Most people really have to take a taxi back to hotel unless they want to walk from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station to Park Place mall and climb the hill because the hotel is not near a bus or MRT stop. 2. Preserves the charm of the original building. Pluses: charming original doors and window hardware, 15-foot ceilings, both a lap pool and a regular swimming pool; wide staircases typical of British empire military buildings; unique location of marble-clad bathroom in the former porch areas. Minuses: you can only enjoy the view from the bathroom, but in rooms facing the city buildings, guests with a normal degree of modesty must take 30 seconds to close the shades before showering and each time they use the toilet (enjoy the view while you're brushing your teeth, though); no mirror in front of the sink but one by the bathtub; windows need more frequent cleaning. 3. The price implies boutique hotel status. Pluses: Virtually 24-hour room service food comes in carry-basket style with all food closed in thermos or dim sum containers; Nespresso coffee maker and iPod docking station in room; a wine and cheese hour in the lobby at 6 pm; happy hour at the bar in The Glass House; interactive TV; big towels, complete set of freebie toiletries; light and shade switches work by touch--a little hard to learn but easy once you know how. Reception staff seem well trained, some Glass House Staff not so well trained. Minuses: thin, small facial tissue, free toothbrush whose bristles fall out at first brushing (reminded us of famous magazine advertisement, \"Ooh, a bristle is caught in my throat!\"); note paper not refilled in box by phone; no clock in the room; only one bar of hand soap--maybe because if you use it in the shower, it sogs up and starts to melt; (hint: if you can't find the hair dryer, look in the secret compartment under the sink); at buffet breakfast in The Glass House, juice glasses approach demitasse size, and juice dispensers are too small, frequently running out. 4. Quiet enjoyment. The room walls seem quite thick. The couple in the room next to us was playing rock music extra loud, and we could only hear the bass notes in our room. On our last night, there was a lot of commotion and laughing in the hall, probably by wedding revelers. But we feel this is a quiet hotel. We feel this is a good hotel for those willing to pay the extra cost of green surroundings and the extra cost of (waiting for, and) using taxis instead of MRT or bus transportation.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "beijing", "Title": "\u201cOasis in the centre of Singapore\u201d", "Author": "kini001", "ReviewID": "UR118696826", "Content": "We stayed in Hotel Fort Canning for 4 nights (2 adults, 2 small children) and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

However, this means that access to the rest of the city is by taxi or a long walk. We had a Deluxe Room with the separate bathroom which worked well for the most part, but for a double room it would be nice to have two chairs so we could both use the desk. The bed could also do with a table or shelf beside the bed for a night-stand. Also there was a surefit of mirrors - some art in their place would have made the room more boutique-like I'd suggest. The \"balcony\" area of the room is separated by clear glass panels from the rest of the room (with the door in the centre). Stupidly, there is nothing on the glass at eye-height to remind you of it's existence - the concierge warned us when showing the room so others must have already walked into the glass . The architect has done a reasonable job converting the heritage building into a hotel - especially the main part of the hotel where the rooms are, but he must have got bored by the time he got to the \"glass house\" dining room which is used for breakfast\". OK, it's mainly made of glass but you might imagine one of those victorian-era light filled glass-houses instead of the 80's-inspired glass box which you are required to dine in - complete with the standard black marble floor (totally out of place in a heritage building - unless you regard the 80s as having a heritage) . Of course you only get the chance to enjoy the ambience of this graceless edifice once you've found your way there through the assault course that is the route from the hotel to the dining room. My partner is disabled (2 replaced knees) and we could find no alternative to the rough paths and stepping stones across the pond to get access. There is a lift that goes nowhere and a convoluted walkway which was closed as it was under repair. A bridge across to the upper lounge would be the answer I suggest. The breakfast buffet was average but, like many hotels, they haven't mastered the art of making tea which was both lukewarm and weak (hint: use boiling water from a kettle and add black tea to your selection). Many others have alluded to the problems of the complex touch switches for the lighting, which completely bemused my Luddite partner. The TV/Audio system was great but why not include radio stations? OK I could stream them to my Laptop using the free Wi-Fi (another nice touch) but the TV/Audio system must have the inputs for radio. The room was also too cold when we arrived and we solved this by turning off the aircon (which can only be set between 18-21 deg C).

We would say that for those with mobility problems, be prepared to take taxis from town back to the hotel (a 5 minute and cheap ride), but those with no mobility problems should have no difficulty with the 5 flights of stairs through the lush parkland, which connect the hotel directly with Penang road and Dhoby Ghaut station.

Try to get a taxi driver to get round the mini-roundabout in the driveway and they can't because it is not quite wide enough for a standard car. The exit out of the lobby towards the breakfast restaurant has 2 steps that make it difficult to navigate a baby buggy over the steps. A little bit of common sense thinking from the designer, that some customers might have a buggy or even a wheelchair, would have solved the problem. Even the walk from the main building to the restaurant. There is no real path. You have to dodge the plants to get round the randomly positioned elevator shaft to get to the restaurant.

The first room was a premium room with blockage in its shower cubicle. When the water level rose, a cockroach follow suit. We requested a change of room as there was a smell as a result of the blockage. The front office told us the hotel was running full, and was unwilling to change the room for us. Upon our insistance, we were given another room. Afte 2 nites without issue, we decided to upgrade the 2 rooms to the premium luxe rooms, as we were told that the sq area was 50sq meters. We were given 2 rooms, one was big and the other was even smaller than the original room. I went to the reception and the lady , Shiloh insisted that although it was smaller, it was still a premium room, and she denied telling me on the phone the previous evening ,that a premium luxe room meant a room with min 50sq meters. Only when the manager Saifu came, did he admit that the size of the premium room was supposed to be minimum 50sq meters. There was obviously a lack of honesty and willingness on the part of Shiloh to own up a mistake . He apologised on behalf of his staff's mistake. They finally gave us another room. This time, the coffee machine was not working, and guess what? the toilet bowl was choked and could not flush down completely. My family had to call them in the middle of the nite, but was told that the engineer was not around. What do we do with the \"waste product in the bowl\" ? They finally came with a toilet plunger, which solved the problem temperorily. My family insisted on changing room as we knew that the same problem may occur again the next morning, the reply was, yes the only other room available was one with airconditioning problem. We were paying more than S$450 a nite for a room that did not even have basic amenities working. It was simply unacceptable! When we finally checked out after 6 days, we were notified by the assistant guest relation manager that they found a scratch on the sofa and would do an investigation. They might charge us on our credit card for that. That really got us fuming mad. Instead of compensating us for all our inconvenience, they were now accusing us, saying that we have damaged their sofa. Being out of the rooms most of the time, my brother did not even sit on the couch, let alone scratching it. I told the assistant manager that I demanded to speak to the higher authority, she said they were not available. I asked if there was an email address which I could write to ,regarding all my dissatisfaction, she told me to write to her. I later went on line to check if i could give any feed back, all I could find was a general email address for reservation and enquiry. Before I left, I told Jasmin that I expected an official letter of apology from the hotel for all the inconveniences that they have put us through. It's been more than 2 months and I have not heard from them. Don't think I ever will. This hotel gives me an impression that there are only a few staffs running the show. There is no higher management, or if there is, they are too busy to care. Lesson learned is , stick with 5 stars hotels with good reputation, such as the four seasons , and you would have a peace of mind that all will be well and you would be treated with a certain level of respect. Even when things do go wrong, like our experience with St Regis, they were quick to respond and quick to own up their mistakes, and make no reservation about apologising. My message to the hotel: The bottom line is this: As a hotel If you are not ready to open for business, don't open for business, there is such a thing as teething problem with new hotels, but from our experience, they are totally not ready for opening , not with their amenities, nor their staff training.

Located in Fort Canning park, it is in walking distance (<15 mins) of major attractions such as Orchard (Shopping), City Hall (Shopping), Esplanade, Fullerton Bay, Clarke Quay, Colonial District and CBD - thus an excellent choice for any traveller, who wishes not to stay in a usual 5* hotel. Besides its ultra-central location (in a park!), the building itself (old colonnial building) and the design of the rooms speak for the hotel. However, since the hotel is still in its opening phase, there are some flaws, such as that there are still workers in the garden (you can't really leave curtains open as they have a open-concept bathroom). I stayed there with my partner for 4 nights in total in 2 different rooms. The deluxe garden rooms are nice, however, with work ongoing, your private garden is not really usable... These rooms are rather small if you are two persons with many bags. Premium Luxe room is really nice (especially 225 is recommendable (city view)). If you are fine with an open-concept bathroom, i strongly recommend those rooms. Minor flaw is that you share the b alcony with 1 or 2 other rooms hence.. you do not want to have curtains open all the time... May be some small walls between balconies could solve this...

We were in the hotel less than 24 hours and had to ask for a second key to be changed 5 times as we could not get it to work (they are electronic); the staff were courteous but lacked conviction. Inside the room is a nightmare (at least ours is) - an electrical challenge in the first place - how to operate a console of lights? how to draw down one blind but not the other (of which more later); how to find a shaver plug (doesn't exist - so forget that battery-powered toothbrush); how to find a second plug to activate a second computer (with difficulty); how to switch on a nespresso machine (look very carefully at the back right). Then there's the problem how to go to the loo without being watched from the inside of the room or exposing oneself to the world though large windows - tha bathroom (at least in our room) appears to have been located in what was probably a balcony - hence the bedroom is inside with no natural light - blinds are available to shade off the bathroom from the bedroom but then plunge the bedroom into total darkness during the day so that electronic switch board has to be navigated all over again (good luck with that). Assuming discretion is required once inside the bathroom - basin located immediately in front of picture window and toilet nearby - a large blind has to be brought down (no switch inside bathroom) plunging this area also into darkness - any switch to turn on lights here? - don't even think about it and head out again for that pesky console. So now the bedroom and the bathroom ar blacked out as if we're expecting a night raid during the day which may be appropriate because this hotel is a refrub of a colonial HQ and latterly a Club. It's not a renovation - from our bathroom window we can see a side window which may have been blocked off from the inside but is perfectly clear from the outside as a crumbling concrete surround with window handles hanging askew - nothing has been made to renovate this aspect or even hide it. need that nespresso to bring you round - two spoons but just one cup. AC turned off at night so the duvet ends up on the floor as you wake from a sweaty dream - only to be dragged back on to the bed around 6am as the ac is turned back on again. Outside new buildings are still being built and the remains of a tatty false lawn has still not even been removed; one swimming pool has builders' rubble along one side and the other appears to have a problem with the drainage system as the deck between the children's pool and the leisure pool is overflowing with water making the whole area a bit like a lake; don't expect nice piles of towels - if you forget to mention you want to go swimming at reception then you're going to have to go back to your room in wet bathers; and don't expect pool service (no in-room service either) or any loos - no sign of staff or evidence of toilets anywhere. Heard enough? Well one last thing - if you drink beer you're not going to be given that at the free drinks hour in the evening - its wine or Cava (yes I said Cava - even airport lounges manage prosecco) or nothing. There's more but you get the picture - only go this hotel if you want a stressful and distressful experience.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cA Romantic Getaway\u201d", "Author": "EatPlaySleepEnjoy", "ReviewID": "UR86338149", "Content": "Lovely room~ spacious, clean, luxurious and simply romantic.
