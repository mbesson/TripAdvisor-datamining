There are many great cafes, restaurants and boutique shops in the neighborhood, plus one of the absolute best beer pubs in all of Amsterdam just down the block ('t Arendsnest, with over 30 specially selected Dutch and Belgian beers on tap, more in bottle). We found the staff to be really helpful and friendly and you could tell they take pride in this family owned hotel which is modern and tastefully done. This is a converted old canal building, and while some may feel the rooms are small, for us they were more than adequate and a good value for our use as a home base in Amsterdam.

Pros: Excellent location, close to the train station, Jordaan, Red Light and Nine Streets Modern Bathrooms look to be recently refurbished, great shower and towels. Nice cafe in bottom of hotel, with complimentary coffee, tea. (Double check - the hotel tried to charge our friends for a few coffees. We were never really sure if they were free but they didn't charge us.) Cons: The bedroom in our room was so small you could barely walk between the wall and the end of the bed. Our room 272 overlooked the canal, but the windows were full of condensation the entire time and the window was at feet level - not much of a view and I suspect the noisiest room in the hotel, right above the front door, cafe and lobby. Generally Noisy Walls are thin enough to hear people talking, not to mention the maid banging around her hoover in the other room. The bed was uncomfortable. Sloping towards the middle and hurt our backs. We found the service to be aloof at best. They did just enough to get by, but never went above and beyond. Barely got one woman's attention to allow us to purchase river cruise tickets. Room Tip: Don't stay in or upgrade to room 272!

The rooms are small by US standards, and average by European standards. The double bed was just two twins pushed together, which tends to be the norm in Europe (unfortunately). The bathroom was quite small, but was designed so cleverly and so well, that it was fun to use. The room and bathroom were immaculate, totally spotless and quite new looking. The included breakfast doesn't have a lot of choices, you may be better off getting something at a nearby cafe. You can also book a room for a half-day (i.e., during a long layover) which is great.

The only problem we had with this room was that the blinds did not work when we came to close them. The member of staff on the desk tried to help but in the end we had to untie the strings on the blind so that the window was covered, which meant we couldn't open it in the morning. We moved to our second room with the minimum of fuss, this was a great room on the top floor, also quite small, but as expected in an old canal house. The room is built into the roof of the canal house so is quite an unusual shape, in a good way! There are 3 windows in total making it nice and light. The room also had a large Van Gogh print on one wall. This room had a double bed, and a great view from the window over the canal, and had a good bathroom too.
