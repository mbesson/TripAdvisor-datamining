I have booked the suite which I thought would be suitable for two adults and one child. When I called the hotel, nobody asked me for the age of the child - assuming that its a newborn! When we arrived it appeared that our suite is REALLY TINY! There was a double bed in the middle, and for my little one -they wanted to put a cot near our bed! When the receptionist saw our child, then immediately assured us that it will be sorted. It was, they put a tiny metal framed bed in our bed end. This tiny metal bed was incredibly uncomfy and noisy, so we ended up with the little one sleeping with us, not really something you dream about paying so much money for a 'luxury' hotel. Tiny bathroom, 'antique' smelly furniture, not something I would like to see and use in a 'boutique' hotel. I am not sure if the room has been cleaned before we arrived, I found old packet of cookies in the drawer of the bedside table. After we went out to town and we get back, cookies have been gone, so somebody definitely searched through the drawers, I had strange impression that our stuff habe been searched through too... No comments for that... The strangest thing was that when we got downstairs, the receptionist had completely NO IDEA where The Maze Grill is. We wanted her to call us a cab, but she had not a clue where this restaurant is located! Shame, Mr Ramsey should check maybe from time to time if his people do know who is he? That put us off, but after the night in the tiny bed, located just nearby the train passing by, we ate the worst breakfast ever downstairs. First of all, we have been ignored by all staff for first 30 minutes. I could not stand waiters and all the same people passing us by, not even asking what would we like to order. Shame, I had to go and ask the waiter to PLEASE finally bring us coffee and eggs benedict. Not really tasty, I think the worst I ever had. I was wondering if ham used to make this dish has been bought from the cheapest supermarket...No smell and plastic taste. Disguisting English muffin, not worth it! And then we had to pay for it, because BREAKFAST IS NOT INCLUDED when we paid \u00a3250 for the night. Ridiculous! Overall impression for the York and Albany downstairs restaurant - filthy, the curtains have never been washed.

The suite itself was fabulously warm and the lighting created a perfect ambience. Having stayed before, it was great to see the little touches that have been added to the rooms; a lovely welcome note on the bed, a jogging map and the smell of jasmine candles really making you feel at home. The bathroom is stocked with White Company products, thick white towels and a huge shower. The Suite really has everything you need to ensconce yourself away for a night. However, rather than a cosy night in with room service we headed to the bar for dinner. I was escorted by reception to the bar and introduced to the bar manager. Once my husband arrived we were swiftly shown to a cosy table in a corner. Our dinner was fantastic and the staff very attentive, my mushroom and chestnut pasta was particularly delicious also the dessert of salt caramel divine. After an uninterrupted sleep in possibly the most comfortable bed ever we went for breakfast in the bar, its open from 7.00am. Greeted by the same staff as the night before, it was lovely to receive such a great welcome again.

I understand from Holly our receptionist that all the rooms are different which is very me.

We went for a bracing walk in Regent's Park, laid on the bed watching afternoon TV and then back to the bar for cocktails. Dinner didn't disappoint and we had an amazing table on the rich red velvety banquette opposite the pass. Outstanding mussels would you believe cooked in Camden ale followed by the Rib-eye. I was in food heaven and full so I only had room left to share a super treacle tart with clotted cream. It was really nice actually because it was clearly Gordon's level of cooking BUT the service was really grounded and informal.

We had been very excited, yet undecided which restaurant to use the voucher at. We decided on York & Albany as a colleague of his had recommended it. My husband booked a table for us for 3pm Saturday 29 October 2011. We followed the directions provided on their website and allowed good time for delays and for the fact that I am heavily pregnant and can 'waddle a little slower' at the moment. We arrived at the restaurant a 3.06pm (6 minutes late). The bar staff directed us to the restaurant there were no staff to greet us immediately, however a well-mannered waitress passed us within a minute or so and asked if she could help. Whilst she was ticking us off the reservation list, what appeared to be a 'hostess' moved between us and the waitress, she ignored us and tutted, waggling her finger at the waitress saying \"No. No. No!\". We were puzzled how she could be so rude to her colleague when we realised she wasn\u2019t criticising her colleague she was insulting us; ignoring us but instructing the waitress not to seat us as we were late. It was now only about 3.08pm. My husband asked what the problem may be and the 'hostess' curtly said without even making eye contact \"What time did you book?\". My husband confirmed 3pm. She then tutted again and said \"3pm? Well you are late and the kitchen is now closed\". I explained in a light hearted friendly manner that I am a little slower than usual walking as I am pregnant, and that we were only about 5 minutes late anyway; which is time that could have been swallowed up by us taking time looking at a menu anyway. There were several covers still left in the dining area who were still eating. My husband suggested if they could then contact one of their sister restaurants, who's kitchen was not closed, to see if they had availability and we would pop in a cab there. She completely ignored our request, and us, and reluctantly after speaking with her colleague said she would ask the chef if he would allow us to stay (??!) We both agreed that if the staff didn\u2019t want to serve us and the chef closed the kitchen at 3pm (when our table had in fact been booked for) then we didn\u2019t want to stay and feel uncomfortable and have half hearted input by the restaurant. We were very disappointed. We had so been looking forward to visit. Safe to say that we won\u2019t be revisiting that restaurant. I very much doubt that my husband's work will be using Ramsay vouchers as rewards anymore and I have suggested that they not rush to the venue if any emergency calls are put in! Good customer services cost litte to provide if you have the right staff, nevertheless it can cost a lot if you have incompetent individuals who do not take pride in their work, or their colleagues or business\u2019s reputation.

Part of the Gordon Ramsey stable of businesses, the property is located on the periphery of Regent's Park, and was to be our initial encounter with European Hotels - for the first two nights of our journey. Chosen by my wife for whom I don't hold a grudge against her, it was simply selected because of its close proximity to her office. Getting out of the cab, and maneuvering our luggage to Reception was the first hurdle to overcome - there is no driveway. One needs to alight at the kerb, and then schlepp one's bags down a cobble stoned passageway (not so easy with bag on wheels) - finally arriving at a large door made of glass and wood as one struggled to figure whether you had to pull or push to get through it. A simple sign on the door would have helped, but the only visible sign was the five-star AA (Automobile Association) accreditation badge on the wall behind the door - stating 'Restaurant with rooms'. I think the place needs a re-valuation... The Registration process was fairly straightforward, but one would not expect much else with just a handful of rooms to manage. Even so, I felt the lady on duty seemed somewhat stressed carrying out a pretty straightforward check-in. After getting our metal keys, we headed up to the 2nd floor, and thankfully, they had an elevator. The short distance seemed to take about two minutes to ascend but was a great relief, as I would have not wanted to carry the heavy luggage up, as could easily have been the case since there wasn't any staff to assist with that task. (My wife and I do not travel light, perhaps a mistake!) The room was quaint - although small - maybe 25sqm, but complete with facilities. One just had to take turns opening the wardrobe and wanting to get in or out of the bed. The same could be said for going in/out of the bathroom after needing to also place luggage in that part of the room. A faux fireplace pretty much covered up one wall, and the ledge above it was used to house two bottles of comp water and some glasses. Naturally, the desk was small, and could not be used at the same time as watching the TV. Air-conditioning was supposed to be provided by an in-room unit, but the outside air was definitely cooler, as experienced when we cracked open the windows. The problem with that practice was the fact that on a fairly regular basis, emergency vehicles whizzed by with sirens howling. This seemed to happen at all hours of day and night in London - and tranquility was something one could only dream of. The request for a second luggage rack was fulfilled by borrowing a chair from the hallway outside of the room, however, the luxury of in-room Tea/Coffee making service was not forthcoming. The shower as I regrettably discovered in a few establishments during our trip was built-in to the bath, but this one had the most bizarre curtain arrangement, and seemed whatever configuration you used for closing the curtains, the floor got soaked. Could this be the rationale for the oversupply of towels - to be used for mopping up water spillage? Our most unfortunate experience was that of pre-authorization on my wife's credit card. As you know most Hotels like to at least pre-authorize for the value of your room rate times the number of nights you are booked in - plus a reasonable buffer for incidentals. Well, she gave the card, and was told it was rejected. She gave another card and while this was being processed she strolled to the adjoining restaurant to take her breakfast. There minutes later and in front of the other dining guests, she was asked rather curtly to check her bank. It was surprising behavior as later we found out that the fault rested on their credit card processing system, and not her credit limit. Seems some people (in London) are a tad too hasty in jumping to conclusions, over matters that directly affect Guest Service (see 45 Park Lane Blog). On the day of departure - we had a leisurely morning, and decided to take our lunch in the Dining Room (really a converted Pub). While the food was good, and also the service, I cannot help but feel the food was not served in accordance to the menu description. For example, I ordered freshly grilled Sardines, and got a freshly grilled Sardine. To me - Sardines is plural, meaning more than one, and not one Sardine, which has been cut down the middle and served as two fillets. I did not point this out. On hindsight, maybe I should have.

It is probably also useful to preface this review by saying that although it was our wedding, we had deliberately chosen this venue because we wanted a small and informal wedding day but with a good splash of luxury. We stayed in the hotel the night before and enjoyed some food and drink at the bar. Food was very good, we ordered pizza which is prepared at the deli next door. Very fresh tasting and clearly all hand made. One of the best pizza's I've had recently. We have eaten in the restaurant here before and had a very good experience. I didnt care much for the olives at the bar but thats not the end of the world. We are cocktail 'enthusiasts' and have drunk in most of the best cocktail bars in the capital. The cocktails here are not the best out there but still very good. All our guests who attended the next day were really raving about them, it is probably only our extensive experience of the best there is that stops me doing the same. I think the prices are quite reasonable as well, a couple of quid more than the average cocktail bar but again certainly less than most hotels. Room was great. Traditional but with a great bathroom and those modern touches that make all the difference eg under floor heating, a decent shower and lights in the wardrobe. Personally I thought it was decent value considering the quality of the hotel and its location but value is very individual. Our wedding day simply could not have gone any better. Prior to the wedding we had a wedding coordinator work with us who was really very good. We were very undemanding and probably made her job pretty easy. For instance we only purchased flowers on the wedding day itself, travelling into London to a florist we had seen and looked decent! One stand out thing was the quality of service. Everyone was not only extremely friendly but also very helpful, identifying minor issues and sorting them before we even noticed. Little things like noticing the sun was shining into some guests eyes through the window and asking if they could close the curtains a little. Both the wedding ceremony and the dinner were held in the regency room which is absolutely beautiful. It was so much better than a registry ofkfice and for the small amount extra you pay for the registrar it is completely worth it. There is no room hire charge and we had the room for the entire day subject only to a minimum spend of \u00a32400 which was easily covered by a guest list of 24. Canapes and drinks in the reception were delicious, as was the food served during dinner. Guests were able to have a choice on the night and food was served at perfect intervals, hot, beautifully presented and by very attentive waiters. At one point the air con got a little cold and as soon as the waiter noticed a couple of guests put their jacket on he immediately adjusted back to a better temperature without so much as having to be asked. Honestly the service was some of the best I have ever experienced, including several very impressive hotels and restaurants. The difference here seemed to be the staff were actually enjoying their job, perhaps they just like weddings. Overall I simply cannot fault this place. Previous reviews talk of dodgy service but I have visited several times now and have never had a bad experience. If you are looking for a hotel that not only has great rooms but also great food and drinks then this is definately the place.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, Brazil", "Title": "\u201cNice food, disappointing hotel\u201d", "Author": "QuincasBorba", "ReviewID": "UR50782978", "Content": "Tennis and fine food are two of our passions, so we planned our trip to London long time in advance in order to attend the ATP Tennis finals (Barclay Cup) at the O2 arena and dine at Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay`s restaurants. For that purpose we booked at two different hotels. The first week in London we stayed in the area of CanaryWharf (close to the O2) and then we moved to the York & Albany in Camden Town. Since we had read some very good reviews of the Y&A and we just had a good experience at the Marriott the days before, we were a little bit disappointed. The first impression: The Y&A entrance is located besides the trash containers of the restaurant. That would not be too much of a problem, except for the fact that the containers are continuously in use. This creates a lot of noise because some bedrooms are precisely few meters away from them. Therefore, very late at night and very early in the morning, you can hear people disposing or retrieving trash. Also, the side street of the hotel has a lot of traffic and every time a heavy truck passed by, our room vibrated. It was quite difficult to sleep and we were tired most of the time. On the positive side the room service was reasonably good and the wireless internet connection was excellent. Rooms are clean (although old fashioned), but not very spacious. People at the reception were friendly. Service at the bar and at the restaurant was frankly disappointing. We noticed that there were too many waiters, but they spent most of their time chatting and away of sight, when their supervisor was not there. We confirmed this impression after we had lunch at other restaurant listed on Ramsay`s website: Maze, which was precisely the opposite. Service at Maze and its food were excellent. (Could it be because Ramsay supervises Maze more closely?) As for the food at Y&A, we were not particularly impressed. Maze was clearly a better choice. We must add though that the Deli at Y&A (Nona) offers a very good selection of traditional pizzas baked in the oven. The experience as a whole was very interesting though. Somehow we understood the point that some critics make. Namely, that once a celebrity chef decides to create an empire and allows his name to be associated to other projects and other chefs, high quality might be put at risk.

Wine list was good and our waitress was knowledgeable enough to help us choose. We were underwhelmed by the dessert options but were too full anyhow. On our way out, we glanced over at the gorgeous bar area and were then drawn to it for another drink.

Well......When you arrive at York and Albany, don't be disappointed, it's not a 'pretty' setting, particularly next to the tyre shop! It's also appallingly signed, particularly for hotel guests, you really have to take a guess at how to get in.........However, when you pass through the door, class and elegance hit you in the face, the decor is beautiful, stunning victorian refurbishment, mixed with ultra modern fittings. When you find the hotel check in desk, it is intimate and the staff particularly attentive - I was very impressed. The room....I booked the four poster deluxe double that is featured in the images on the website....it is stunning - beautiful antique furniture, stunning high ceilings, what's missing is the fire to give it the cosy finish and to be honest, the settee is a little 'shoved' in at the end of the bed. The bathroom is a little clinical, but is full of quirky features, but with the original windows is particularly draughty!! A lovely glass of champers on arrival was particularly welcome as I settled in, but alas, to no avail, whatever myself and the 'concierge' tried, we couldn't get our satellite TV to work - when we had booked the York and Albany 6 months before for a romantic laze away weekend, this was of particularly annoyance as we wanted to laze in bed and chill, read and watch TV, not go out and sightsee. Luckily there was another room available in the same category and after a quick look, we arranged to move. This one was much less traditional, but still as luxurious and had a bigger bed.........Lovely!! The Restaurant on valentines evening, was of course busy. The service though - BEWARE, is appalling. We were seated at 20:30 in time, but were not given a menu, or asked if we would like a drink for around 20 minutes. NOT what you expect from the reputation of Angela Hartnett and Ramsays. The food, was particularly good, the wine choice was also really satisfactory. Again though - despite liking the length of time to sit and eat for a valentines dinner (we ended up leaving at around 2330 - 3 hours later!), it was the attention to detail and the atmosphere that lacked from our less than interested waiter. Luckily for us, the company was great and we weren't in a hurry, but it wasn't necessarily that, it was the lack of interest as I say. Hence when checking out we refused to pay the 12.5% service - \u00a325 quid in all for lacklustre service is just not on. The building inside is beautiful, the bar area surprisingly relaxed and not full of pretence. The food seriously good, and the deli offers lots of options adjacent! All in all a lovely, romantic weekend, but not quite up to the price tag is our verdict! Angela still has a lot to overlook if it's going to stay as busy as it currently is in its' early days........", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStylish Boutique Hotel in Perfect Location\u201d", "Author": "SandALondon", "ReviewID": "UR24049075", "Content": "The rooms in the hotel are gorgeous--traditional decor with modern touches.

The building is an old London pub with a newish Hotel attached. Just 10 rooms and on a busy junction near Regents Park Zoo. Camden Town tube is about 300m away and buses pass just outside. It's a 10 minute / \u00a38 taxi ride to Oxford Street. Our room was the second grade up and was fantastic. Old heavy wooden furniture and the largest bed we have slept in with immaculate linens, a wonderful wet room bathroom and real style. Everything is immaculately chosen, stylish, comfortable and luxurious. We were right on the third floor right on the front of the building overlooking the junction but noise levels were fine. Unfortunately the lift was temporarily broken (teething troubles they say) but everything else was absolutely amazing. Breakfast is extra (with a very wide range from \u00a312 for full English or \u00a36 for porridge) and can be taken downstairs in the restaurant. There is also room service. If you want to dine there are 3 options. In the cocktail bar downstairs there are relaxed low tables and chairs ideal for grazing. Towards the rear there is a very modern and stylish restaurant with huge windows looking onto the patio. Then in the basement is another restauarant all red and black and with the open kitchen, warm and relaxed. In each case the styles are are brilliantly done.....as is the food. This is Angela Hartnett's baby and it shows. We ate there 3 times in 2 days and it was fantastic and great value for the quality of food. Starters begin around \u00a36 and mains \u00a310 to \u00a318 but its a very flexible menu. They have a great value set lunch - 3 courses for \u00a325. There is a separate drinks menu. The wine list runs from about \u00a312 to over \u00a3100 / bottle and there are lots of great cocktails to sample. Prices are reasonable for central London But what made this place so brilliant for us was the staff. I have stayed in London on business for over 100 nights / year for the last 3 years and have never seen staff so good, open, friendly, knowledgeable and committed. It starts in the hotel reception and runs through the bar and waiting staff. Smooth and efficient and I lost count of how many knew our names. Ask about the food or wine and they know the answers or if they dont they say so and find out! You get the impression that they are trained committed and want to work there. Quite simply this place bowled us over. It is not cheap but then its not expensive either. For the same price you can stay in a corporate box or in this beautifully run, fantastic pub with great food on tap and marvellous staff.
