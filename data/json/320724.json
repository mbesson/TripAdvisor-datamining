The rooms are clean bright and spacious. Breakfast is excellent ,theres lots to choose from, hot or cold.

The hotel location for the ICC is great with a single stop with the TRAM or a pretty 20 min footwalk to the ICC (get a map though!). There are hotels closer to the ICC and Messe, but this one is also close to the Kudamm with theaters, bars, restaurants, and biergardens + well connected with public transportation to do things after work. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood and the staff is friendly. We really liked the breakfast buffet.
