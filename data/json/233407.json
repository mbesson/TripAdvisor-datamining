Medici hotel fullfilled all what other travellers already mentioned here. From Termini station it takes approximatelly 15 minutes by walk to get there, otherwise you can use bus nr. 75 for instance. The street where the hotel is located is nice, with some restaurants and shops around. Check in went really smoothly, what is funny, they still use the old keys ( kind of retro :-) and not the cards. Receptionist was really nice, explained us everything, checked for us the weather forecast. Wifi code is to be asked at the reception and is for free, however it works properly just in the reception and the lobby, in the rooms the signal may get lost. Room was clean, with own bathroom, hairdryer, amenities, minibar ( surprisingly the prices there were not overpriced), heater, aircondition, flat TV ( selection of channels not so great but who would watch TV in rome?) big wardrobe. The beds were not so comfortable, I did not like my pillow, however one may find it ok. All over the rooms and hotel have a touch of history, which you feel in Rome on every step you take. Lobby is great, with ancient sofas, statues, flowers, lamps and so on. Also you can enjoy a TV there. The hotel has also own garden, as it was raining we did not have chance to try it. Breakfast room is very basic as the whole breakfast is. As it is small it may get pretty busy in there. The pastries are great, selection of cheese and salamies is basic, yoghurts, cereals, butter and jam. Coffee and juices ok. I missed toast machine. All over, the hotel is a 3star standard, clean with walking distance to major attraction and definetely I would stay there again if travelling to Rome.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leiden, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cVery good 3 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sotiria T", "ReviewID": "UR122886840", "Content": "We stayed for a long weekend for the New Years and we were quite satisfied.

We are a couple in our early 30s from Ireland. This was our 3rd trip to Rome. We selected Medici on the basis of reviews on Trip Advisor. Positives: * 10 minute walk with luggage from termini. * Reasonable walking distance to most major sites. * Not far from 2 Metro Stations. * Staff were friendly and willing to accommodate your needs as best as possible. * Hotel was clean. * Coffee/cappuchino maker in breakast room. * A lovely little flower shop, pizza place La Biesta (I think) and a spice shop in the area. Negatives: * Reception area leads one to believe that the hotel is much grander than a 3 star but when you get to the rooms you realise it is very much 3 star. We had to change rooms 3 times before we were content to stay. Primarily based on how incredibly small and pokey the first 2 rooms where. * The walls are paper thin. On our last morning we were awoken by girls in the room next to us screaming at each other. We reported it to reception who called the room to address the issue but had to do so 3 times before it ceased. Other guests were also disturbed by the noise. Hotel staff were apologetic. * Decor in the room is dated and a bit of TLC could give the hotel a fresher more modern appearance in line with it's reception area. Overall, we could not fault Medici massively, it does exactly what it says on the tin - it was an average price for an average hotel. The hotel won't excite you but it will meet the basic needs of cleanliness, proximity, reasonable price and pleasant staff.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cA perfect place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Erik S", "ReviewID": "UR121570014", "Content": "This charming italian style hotel has a very nice downtown location on a tranquil street with a number of really good restaurants, wine bars and groceries/delicacy shops.

The hotel staff were polite and friendly, and the front desk always seemed to be manned. The hotel is located in a very quiet street and outside noise was minimal, if non-existant.

We are not quick walkers, and it took us around 45 mins to get to the Colosseum and 25 mins to the Spanish Steps. The nearest tube stations are about 15-20 mins away.

They helped us book taxis and answered all of our questions as best as they could-plus there was free access to the internet which kept my brother suitably entertained at times! The location of the hotel is a little bit of a walk from the Termini, but I was actually glad of this as the area around the Termini wasn't overly inviting and I was glad we'd decided on a hotel further away from there! Our street was actually fairly quiet so we slept soundly at night! The Piazza d'Republika is located within close proximity to the hotel and it leads you onto the Via Nazionale which is a great starting point to quite alot of the sights and there is also a Metro stop at the Piazza too. A word of warning though-the machines only give back a max of \u20ac4 change so if you've got bigger notes you might want to grab some change so your transaction will go through. Overall our stay at Hotel Medici was a very pleasurable one-the bathroom was very pleasant and a welcome change from our previous hotel in Florence. The only drawback with our room was that three beds in it was quite a tight squeeze and such close proximity to siblings at times can be dangerous!!! I definitely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel, Great location, Wonderful for women travellers\u201d", "Author": "SwannTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR7163555", "Content": "As two single female travellers, safety was a concern when we were in Rome. This hotel was wonderful, in an excellent location - close enough to Trevi station to be convenient, but in a very nice area of the city where we felt very safe. Stayed for three nights in late November 2006. When we arrived later than we intended, the desk clerk was extremely friendly and also upgraded us to one of the largest double rooms in the hotel - on the second floor in the corner. Lovely facilities, high ceilings, quiet, comfortable beds, gorgeous marble bathroom. Everything was spotless and beautifully decorated. We were especially impressed with the flat-screen TV and the English channels - MTV and CNN. Breakfast in the morning was good - both hot and cold options, meats, cheese, bread, cereal, juice... nicer than other European hotels we've stayed in. Overall, would definitely recommend it!

Besides being a fully adequate hotel with a friendly and very helpful staff the story of Medici is location. This neighborhood is full of wonderful ristorantes, and cafes and a 12 Euro taxi ride from all of ancient Roma. A few blocks away is the modern art gallery MACRO as well as the Termini and great shopping. The rooms are very well air conditioned; AC is not a priority in most of Rome. For the price I cannot think of an equivocal value in the West, remodeled in 1997 this location is very clean and well appointed. Rooms sizes vary greatly as we had multiple rooms for our party, the front desk will be happy to allow you to check out another room if the one you're assigned is not adequate, based of course on availability at that time The only caveat is that several rooms including singles, doubles, and triples have rather small, \u2018phone booth\u2019 showers. The service staff is professional and proactive offering attention to any need gladly. While there\u2019s no breakfast meats or eggs the morning meal provided is very adequate. We paid 120 Euro per night and got much more than our monies worth, we were just down the street from rooms costing twice that, with the primary difference being a well marbled lobby. If this hotel price were a stock it\u2019s a strong buy and undervalued. The best tip I can offer is that the cheapest bottled water on Via Flavia is at a market just across the street to your left as you exit the hotel, I cannot recall the name except that it had a black awning including the word \u2018Cuisine\u2019. A standard sized bottle of water was 0.55 cents Euro here, the same bottle ranged to 1.45 cents Euro on the same street, a full liter was 0.85 cents Euro.

Surprised at some of the adverse comments by some Tripadvisor members, but can understand others. We arrived to find the reception staff under a bit of pressure - however they managed to sort out the guests problems fairly quickly. We had a room on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel - clean, reasonable size with an adequate shower/toilet. No problems there! The staff were, on the whole, efficient and friendly - anything we requested was attended to right away. The breakfasts were a slight letdown. No fresh cheeses or hams, and the rolls were about as large as a vol-au-vent - I suppose you get what you pay for. The only major problem we encountered was with a small proportion of the guests - a bunch of loud and drunken young male Americans, who rolled in at 4.00am, with no regard for any other guests - shouting and generally making a nuisance of themselves. Finally another guest, an Italian, took issue with them and reminded them that they were visitors to Europe, not a Barbarian horde - problem solved. All in all, the Hotel provided a good, value for money base in Rome, and we would have no hesitation in returning.", "Date": "June 18, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Medici", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d233407-Reviews-Hotel_Medici-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$87 - $199*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Flavia 96</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "233407", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/91/5c/915c8b150a3a05d131abc19b6a3a533c9large.jpg"}}
