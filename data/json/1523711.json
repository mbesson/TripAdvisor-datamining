We had a 1 bedroom deluxe apartment which was booked direct with the hotel. Even though it says 1 bedroom, they had placed an extra double bed in the living room, so you can easily sleep 5 (2 doubles + 1 single bed) We had a sea view - but no balcony (we were happy for that with young kids,,, and a long drop) Positives: 1) Plenty Space 2) Modern apartments serviced daily 3) Well equipped kitchen for simple family meals (+ iron + safe + washer/dryer....etc...) 4) Attentive & friendly staff (a big difference from 2010 and 2011 stays) 5) Fast and simple check-in and check-out Negatives. (nothing really, but....) 1) The main pool is too cold. Fine for serious 'sports' swimming - but too chilly for the kids 2) We suffered noise on this stay: a) Elevators binging all night next to our room b) Huge pool party & disco just outside our room until 10pm : without warning from hotel c) Drilling at 10:30 and 11:30 at night (Turned out to be in the offices 7 floors below us!) I would certainly stay here again - and I would certainly recommend staying there for business or leisure. Always Taxis available on the door step night ans day - and all taxis know the hotel when coming home. Metro station on the door step (but this must be the only station on the whole network with 50 (fifty) steps to climb... beware if you have a pram or little kids!

We stayed here for three nights. Unfortunately our flight arrived at 7 am and our room was not available until 2 pm.

Being centrally located on Sheikh Zayed Road, and only a 5 minutes walk to the metro station, travelling about was a breeze. And if you needed to get somewhere in a hurry, simply step out and hail a cab in less than 3 minutes. There are plenty of cabs circling the area. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment that was clean and tastefully furnished. At times the place seemed too big, but it was really comfortable. The kichenette comes in handy if you are a long stay guest, but since we were there only for a few nights and was out most of the time, we did not use the facilities much.

We had no problems booking, this was quick and convenient. We was shown to our room which was a one bedroom apartment. This hotel is in a great location. Less than 5minutes walk from the hotel to the nearest metro station (Internet city). You've got the Dubai Marina on one side of the line and the Emirates mall on the other, where there is a supermarket. You can catch a bus from outside the hotel to the beach. The hotel is just outside the main road of Sheikh Al Zayed Road. It took us 30 minutes from the airport to the hotel. This hotel has three swimming pools, two large and one small paddle pool. The thing we loved most about the hotel was the outside Jacuzzi by the pools. The hotel also has separate Sauna and Steam rooms within the Mens and Ladies changing rooms which was quite convenient for privacy. The hotel is neutrally decorated but with expensive taste. Another superb thing about the hotel is it comes with a Kitchen so you can make your own snacks and drinks. Would recommend this hotel. But remember to book a seaview room if you would like one because they have different booking for different sides. we went in January and the weather there was sunny everyday but we had wind that made the day cool, never the less this enabled us to get around more.

The views were nothing short of spectacular thanks to the large windows covering most of the walls. The suite was very spacious with a kitchen and living room separated from the bedroom and bathroom. Having just come from a hotel where the service was incredible, it may be unfair to say that I did not get an as warm welcome at this hotel as I would have expected, but I felt the whole place was a little bit sterile and less homely than I would've liked, but others may see it differently. I didn't experience any of the dining in the hotel so cannot comment on that. The outdoor pool area was clean and attractive, with the benefit of a hot tub and an infinity edge to the pool, with views to the The Palm and ocean. Location-wise, it's conveniently right next to the metro station (a 30 second walk) out of the front entrance. Speaking of which, that entrance is right on the busy main road but seems to be somewhat still unfinished i.e. piles of sand. Overall, I wouldn't jump at the chance to stay here again.

Either the breakfast (ordered via roomservice) was divine... including really everything one could imagine or terreible with ice cold baked beans, no orange juice or bread as they had missed to put it on the breakfast tray. Same regarding the cleaning usually the personel did a perfect job....or they forgot to fix our room and we had to call them like 3 times at 8pm to get the room in order. Nice pool area and gym. Some restaurants and coffee shops around the hotel, but usually we took a taxi to Mall of Emirates that is very near and other places, as the Internet City where the hotel is located is quiet.

Knew it was in Jumeirah beach area and was a 5 star rating. Arrived early but could not check in til 2pm. You have to enter the hotel from the back as the footpath at the front has not been completed yet. Receptionist was not particularly cheerful and seemed quite short at times. When we returned at 2pm, booking in was relatively painless and did not take too long. All of the other hotel staff were cheerful and extremely helpful. We had booked a double room but received a one-bedroom apartment on floor 10. It was spacious, tidy and clean and had everything we required. It was cleaned thoroughly every day and clean towels provided. The furnishings were very modern (fully fitted kitchen. leather sofa in lounge, etc.) There was a flat screen TV in both the lounge and the bedroom which had numerous channels to watch, none of which were UK channels, although there were re-runs of UK soaps on one of the American channels. The hotel does not have a bar and is not licensed! If you like a drink in the evening make sure you stock up on arrival at Dubai airport. Some hotels and a few bars and restaurants are licensed, but with most alcoholic drinks starting at around \u00a38, it is worth having some in your room. There is an outdoor pool on floor 6 along with a well equipped gym. Towels are provided and there are plenty of sun beds around the pool. There is a small supermarket around the corner (about 5 min walk) which is handy to stock up on soft drinks and snacks. There is ample space in the apartment fridge. The hotel is right next to the Dubai Internet City metro station. We used the metro regularly to get around and found it to be extremely good value. A one day travel pass was 16 dirham (around \u00a33 at current exchange rates) and could be used as often as needed during the day. The metro was very impressive. It runs on time and is very clean and tidy. All of the announcements are in English and Arabic making it very easy to navigate around the many tourist attractions. The Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall are approx 25mins (plus a 10 min walk) and the Mall of the Emirates is approx 15 min and is directly linked to the metro via a short air conditioned walk. The Dubai Marina is also about 15 min on the metro. Walking around Dubai is difficult because of all the roadworks taking place which mean that the footpath disappears. That said, we did manage to walk to the nearest public beach which took around 15 minutes. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will certainly visit Dubai again. The hotel was in a good location for many of the attractions, however I would not agree that this hotel is a 5 star as there is no bar. In my opinion it is at best a 4 star hotel.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel is at good location but its problem the bad service\u201d", "Author": "Dee_uae", "ReviewID": "UR119154411", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel as couple with infant,we booked the one bed room apartment, the room is clean but its need more attention specially the bed sheets and the floor.

The reception is very very poor - never enough staff and everthing takes a very long time. The 1 bed appartment is large - but the furnishings are very poor, old and in need of much updating. Allthough this is sold as an appartment - there are no kitchen knives, the pans given are in very poor state of repair and basically all you have a plates, glasses and knives and forks - nothing to really be self catering or even attempt to cook anything. Breakfast in a morning is extreamly poor - with little quality choice (compared to other hotels I have stayed in in Dubai) and especially the fruit juice is dreadfull. I had mold all over my ceiling last week (and although painted its coming back already). The porter \"Ram\" is very friendly and the guy cleaning the room trys his best with what he has.. but simple things like cleaning the balcony are forgotten and thus if you walk outside your feet are black... There are only 3 lifts for 20 odd floors (with no stairs) and one has been totally out of service for 2 weeks.... says it all really.

For that reason I feel I have a pretty good grasp of what the experience is really like. Below are the good and bad things about the hotel from my experience. Location is good and access to the freeway is good. The hotel pool is nice and the gym is also nice but pretty small. Parking in the second floor basement was nice. It was annoying not to get a badge to park underground. Every time I pulled in I had to wait sometimes up to 5 min until someone from the hotel realized it was me who was honking trying to get their attention to come and badge me in. The hotel cleaning service was very poor. Because I transacted a lot of business with the states, I was often up very late. Every time I slept in past 9am I was awoken by the cleaning service either talking too loud in the hall or loudly cleaning an adjacent room. The cleaning service also never really cleaned. They vacuumed, replaced the towels, and made the bed but never cleaned. I ended up getting bathroom cleaner and cleaning the entire bathroom and kitchen myself. If you don't believe me that they never really cleaned. Ask my wife who visited who is 3 months pregnant if the toilet ever got cleaned and she'll confirm it never did :) If your room like mine was on the side of the freeway, don't think you'll ever be able to open the window without getting a lot of noise. Every employee thinks they can speak English but none of them can so don't think anything you say will be understood and answered correctly. Because no employee really understands you, don't expects to get great service. I asked at least 30x and 10 different people to have the clock on my TV changed to the correct time. In six weeks I never had somebody come and fix it. I had a studio apartment with a kitchen. In the kitchen one of the electrical burners did not work. Again, I asked at least 30x and 10 different people to please come and fix the burner. It was never fixed. The internet is expensive and doesn't work very well. The internet is 300 dirhams for a week and it is wireless. Two times the internet went out for 5 plus hours. I sat in the lobby with multiple other guests trying to get the hotel to do something but because they didn't understand English and the IT guy leaves at 5pm we were stuck with no internet. I wrote the hotel and never received a proper apology. The two holidays I stayed during revealed that the hotel significantly allowed the rooms to be overbooked which forced a lot of complaints. Overall after six weeks I will never stay at the Grand Midwest again. I think they are trying to establish themselves as a legitimate hotel but have a long way to go.

This was a pre-paid rate from Expedia. Our room was on the 9th floor, with a sea view \u2013 the city view would not be too interesting I guess! We had read previous reviews about the lack of baby cots, so made sure that we mentioned this request in the Expedia booking \u2013 however, we shouldn\u2019t have bothered as the hotel paid no attention to the request, and as predicted there were only 6 cots for the whole hotel. Out of the 6 nights, our 6 month old slept on blankets on the floor for all but 1 of the nights. Numerous requests were made to various levels of staff, but this appeared to be a minor issue for them. The windows were absolutely filthy \u2013 we managed to clean a patch on the windows by leaning through a gap in the opening, so in the end the view was fine. I can\u2019t believe how dirty the windows were, they made a good sunny day look like an overcast dull day. The windows were double glazed, so the soundproofing was great. There was never a problem catching a taxi from outside the hotel \u2013 and we never had a driver who hadn\u2019t heard of the hotel and/or area. Some reviews stated otherwise. The rooms were clean, spacious and modern \u2013 although I am quite sure our apartment was one of the largest one bedroom apartments. 1 x 32\u201d Samsung LCD in the lounge and 1 x 26\u201d Samsung LCD in the bedroom, although a few more European channels were needed. We had 1 bathroom inc. WC, and a guest WC near the kitchen. The kitchen was fine, and included the essentials (microwave, toaster, kettle, pans, plates, glasses, etc\u2026) There was also a decent fridge/freezer and a very handy washer/dryer. There were no tea towels, cloths or washing power provided. There was a simple iron and ironing board \u2013 and a hair dryer. There was no DVD player, although this is mentioned on every website as included in the room. The bedroom included plenty storage space, and even a small safe (although I think you had to pay to use it). The cleaning staff did a good job every day, they were very discrete and friendly. The apartment was missing a dining table in our opinion \u2013 there was a breakfast bar, but this is hardly suitable for children. We had a balcony, but this was not very child friendly, with easy options for climbing up and over the rails (and as there was no lock on the balcony door, it was a bit of a hazard for our 3 year old). There are two decent shops very close by, a 24hr restaurant on the premises, and a COSTA coffee in the next building. The METRO stop is right outside, but was not open in February 2010. The Gym, Sauna and Steam room were ok \u2013 but the pool and \u2018Jacuzzi\u2019 were far too cold (and therefore empty!). Don\u2019t expect hotel \u2018like\u2019 service \u2013 think of it like a short term flat rental from a dodgy landlord. Tourist info was limited and/or wrong. This hotel(?) is a very affordable choice, but avoid it if you have young kids \u2013 or bring your own cot! The staff were well aware there were no cots, but would try to convince us every day that they would \u2018find a solution\u2019 \u2013 which never came.
