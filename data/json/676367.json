It is in a residential part of Lower Garden District almost halfway between the French Quarter and the epicenter of Magazine street. The area is great with not much sign of new builts, filled with beautiful wooden southern houses, with just a touch of New Orleans decadance (and I say that as a plus), but totaly safe. Transport is a piece of cake as the streetcar runs between the Uni and the French Quarter just a block away from the hotel. But even if you decide to walk, the quarter is just 30 min walk from the hotel and quite easy to follow. That is not recommended at night though as you need to pass from the business district which is a bit deserted after working hours. On the west, the core of Garden District, Magazine street and the old graveyards are withing comfortable walking distance. Also, oposite the streetcar station there are some great eateries with bbq, pizza (you have to try Slice!!!!) and po-boys. Now about the hotel itself, make sure you book yourself in Prytania Oak, NOT Prytania Park. They are under the same management (i think) but I only have an opinion about Oaks. To be honest, Park looks much shabbier than Oaks. The building is an old style southern house, not too lavish but full of character, the rooms look newly refurbished, there is a nice little backyard which is great for meeting your neighbors or you are a smoker like me. And we absolutely loved the room!! BIG, fat, comfortable bed with mosquito net, the kind you never come accross in Europe unfortunately, espresso machine, nice wooden floors, big bathroom with a fireplace (don't know if it's functioning). The only thing I could fault is the lack of plugs. I know it's not important but that shows the quality of the room. The biggest asset of this hotel for me is the fact that it adds to the N Orleans experience as it looks and feels unmistakenly southern at a very high quality level.

Firstly, the location is within easy walking distance of several nice restaurants and a streetcar stop. It seemed safe when I visited, I didn't see any sketchy characters around although one would want to take the typical precautions for visiting an urban area. The room was slightly smallish but very comfortable. I was worried about being on the first floor but I never heard any noises above or beside me. And I'm not one to stay in a property merely because it's historical, but it's hard not to be impressed by what a beautiful building it is. Minus the modern amenities, you feel like you could be staying in New Orleans, circa 1915. The breakfast included with the stay is not particularly satisfying, but for such a small hotel I probably shouldn't hold that against them. There were several places to get breakfast in the neighborhood. I vacillated on 4 or 5 stars, but considering I got a good price on the room and that it seemed more reasonable than other upscale New Orleans small hotels, I'm giving them the extra star for value.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFirst anniversary\u201d", "Author": "J9L", "ReviewID": "UR127942071", "Content": "We stayed at the Prytania Oaks the weekend of the French Quarter fest.

The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. These are always the most important to me. I would return, but expecting less and avoiding room 264. It didn't get internet signal, the room was too small for a reading chair, so I had to sit on the bed always if my husband was using the one desk chair. There was only one nightstand meaning my book and glasses had to go on the floor, and we slept with earplugs due to the cooler unit outside the window which cycled on and off all night. Cons have been written by many others. Getting to the hotel gate only to see a sign indicating that you will have to drag the luggage down the block and across two streets to check in at the sister hotel. That info should be emphasized on the reservation beforehand. We would have parked in the other hotel's lot for convenience during check in. Or rolling out of bed to find out no one is available to serve breakfast in the nice breakfast room on-site that has tables. Instead, you have to go to the other hotel where there is no place to sit down, so you juggle coffee, a roll, yogurt or cereal while standing or balance it all while walking across the streets and through the locked gate to your room. This has been written about so many times that it doesn't seem like an isolated incident. They need to get their staffing problems dealt with and open the breakfast room on a regular basis. It should be part of what we are paying more for at the Oaks. I had higher expectations (my fault) based on what people had written and due to the wording I read and heard from the hotel: \"Garden District Collection of Fine Boutique Hotels.\" It is a collection of three but not a boutique hotel. It's not in the Garden District, but ten blocks away in an area sometimes called Lower Garden District. The two areas are very distinct.The Room Maintenance card states \"engineering department.\" I saw a maintenance man. It's too bad the wording stretches the truth. I know the owner wrote on Trip Adviser to someone who had complained that \"you get what you pay for\" so I shouldn't have thought it was really in the Garden District for the price.

When we reached the property, the neighborhood changed considerably to quiet, tree-lined European-style streets with lovely statues and gardens. The room had incredibly high ceilings with solid, elegant wooden furniture and marble counters in the bathroom. Our room was in a separate building from the main lobby, but that was fine as we never had to go to the main desk. Never got the WiFi to work, but I carry a MiFi, so I didn't ask for help. The room was clean and very quiet. Never heard anybody else and had great nights' sleep. Breakfast was served in a small garden house across a walkway.

Otherwise, cold cereal and instant oatmeal and grits. I'm from the south; in some areas it's illegal to offer/eat instant grits ;-) Turned out we had booked during Carnival (didn't know that going in...) and streets all around us were blocked off for the parades.

I will not come back on what he wrote but will write my own review. We stayed at the Prytania Oaks for 2 nights in December (24th, 25th). I have nothing bad to say about the physical hotel/room. It was clean and quiet. We were on the second floor with a view on the street and the room had a little balcony. Since it was nice outside, it was great to use it although there was only 1 chair for 2 people. The water pressure in the shower was great. There is free Internet and free parking (a big plus but we found 3 free parking spots downtown on the South-East corner of Camp St./Poydras just besides a paying parking lot.) Besides the service, we were disappointed with the location and the breakfast. The location was so-so. Yes, it is only a block to get on the St-Charles tram but if you want to walk, it is not great. To go to the Vieux Carr\u00c3\u00a9, it takes between 20 and 35 minutes (I timed it) depending on how fast you walk and you have to walk under some kind of overpass. Not great at night. The Garden District is about a 10-12 minutes walk in the other direction. As far as the breakfast goes, it was a buffet situated in the lobby of the Prytania PARK hotel, across the street. It was awful to have to go over there and come back with your hands full or with a tray and try to open the gate. Standing in the lobby to eat would have been as awkward. The choice was also very basic: store-bought jelly Danishes, packs of grits and oatmeal, juice and milk, yogurt. There were no fruit the 2 days I was there and even though there were individual packs of butter and jam, there were no plain croissant, bread or bagel to smear them on. The 2 days we had breakfast there, we had another breakfast about 1 hour later. Now, let me come back to the response of the manager of my husband's review since there are a couple of inaccuracies in them that make us look stupid. 1) The OTA we used was not Canadian nor obscure. It was CheapOair.com. 2) The manager writes that she has never heard of it but strangely when the front desk clerk called her to explain the mix-up and asked what to do, she said to the clerk who repeated to us: \"Yes, other customers complained about this site and we have registered a complain with the Better Business Bureau. The problem is that they used the details of the Prytania Oaks for Prytania Park and vice-versa.\" Clearly, they had knowledge of this problem before. 3) Twice she says that they \"showed\" us something on their computer. They never showed us anything. They \"told\" us. Anyway, I believe that their computer and our papers were not saying the same thing. The problem lies elsewhere. In her response, the manager is very condescending, uses adages and makes it sound like we are novice travelers, not smart for booking through an OTA and that we were taught a good lesson. We have lived in different parts of the world and traveled all over. We always book through OTA, never direct. And we have never had any problems except this time. We were completely floored when this happened. It was X-Mas Eve, the day before had been my birthday, we had booked this months in advance and this is how we were treated. Let me add that the manager never showed up. It was the front desk clerk who called to see if he could do something but the manager said plainly no. We were amazed and shocked but never started yelling in anger even though we said we would definitely write it on TripAdvisor. I kept repeating: \"This is incredible. I've never seen such practice before.\" The lobby is under video and audio surveillance. Please look again at your footage. I don't know if the owners and the manager are one person. If so, there is nothing to do about it. If not, I think it is high time management be evaluated too. I say \"too\" because on the cards where guests can leave comments, it says that employees are evaluated and that their monthly bonuses depend on the reviews. Also I find it very odd that every time the manager replies to a bad review, it is never her fault. Never once does she takes responsibility. The hotel will never be able to make itself better with such attitude. I am sure the manager will answer something to my review and it is her right to defend herself but keep in mind that in her response to my husband's review, there were 3 inaccuracies in it so whatever she writes back, take it with a grain of salt. You can say the same thing about my review and think that I am just a traveler scorned, but look at my contributions. I have several and know how to travel and know when service is good or bad. I will not come back to this hotel even though I'll definitely be back in New Orleans.

Not to sound like a broken record (since everyone seems to use this word to describe the place), but what a GEM! Seriously... it is beautiful and charming. So, here's the scoop: The Room: We were in Room 267 and had a balcony view overlooking Prytania Street. The moment we walked in the room, I was all ooo's and ahhhh's! There were beautiful hardwood floors, a queen-sized four poster bed, a desk, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, an armoire, a mounted flatscreen tv, HUGE vaulted ceilings (at least 12 feet high), and two sets of the most gorgeous french doors leading out to a lovely balcony just outside of the room overlooking the street. The bathroom was beautiful, even down to the detail they put into framing out the sink with some lovely crown. Very nice. I will admit that the room would have been cramped if we had giant luggage (no place other than the skinny armoire to store suitcases or spread out, but we only had our small weekend bags, so we kept them on the desk and in the nice sized foyer by the door. The space was absolutely perfect for what we needed and was really clean and classy. It felt like a real treat to have the pleasure to stay there. Comfort: The bed was comfortable and the pillows were fine, though I have to admit... I am partial to feather pillows and was a little disappointed that this amazing room did not have them. Oh well. Out of fairness, I did not ask if they had any feather pillows because the pillows were comfortable enough that it wasn't a big deal. The shower was wonderful! I loved the heavy water pressure (it was heavenly and I kept raving about it!) but, apparently, I spent a little too long enjoying my shower bc my husband said the temp never really got hot enough for his liking (which wasn't my experience at all). The next day I took a more responsible shower (wasn't in there for an eternity-- ha!) and hubby said the temperature was perfect, so I really think it was my fault that first day. The thermostat kept the temperature just perfect for us and there was a ceiling fan should we have needed it (though we didn't since there was a cold front those two nights). The comforter looks thin but kept us plenty warm and very comfy. Light/Noise: We were in love with the black-out curtains they had in the room, which kept it nice and dark for a restful night's sleep. As for noise, while I am a super heavy sleeper, my husband is not and did mention that he could hear people walking up/down the stairwell late at night and dragging their luggage down the stairs first thing in the morning. He could also hear the street noise whenever a car drove by, but not so much so that any of this made it difficult for him to sleep, which was good. I would recommend that light sleepers not request a street view though because there would be a higher chance of any noise distracting you. Again, as a heavy sleeper, I slept like a baby so it was perfect to me. :-) Convenience/Location: The Prytania Park Hotel (sister property) is just across the street, caddy corner from the Prytania Oaks and is where you check in. The staff was great! Dana, in particular, took a lot of time with me to provide restaurant suggestions and such-- she was fantastic and so, so helpful (thanks, Dana!). We parked our car in the free (and well-lit) parking lot over by the main office, which seemed preferable to parking in one of the only five or six spots that are adjacent to the Prytania Oaks building. And the location of the hotel to the hot spots of New Orleans was excellent-- 1.7 miles from the French Quarter (which we walked-- only took about 35-4o minutes on foot and it provided a beautiful stroll through lovely old homes, pretty parks, and even some of the downtown skyscrapers-- great diversity! The hotel is situated in the Garden District and is conveniently just one-two blocks from the St Charles trolley (a $3 per person ticket for a full day of unlimited rides on the city trolleys/buses). While we opted to just explore on foot, it was nice knowing the trolley was there as a back-up plan and it was fun to see it passing through the city. :-) There are lots of great food options on St Charles Street, so the fact that we were so close by to that major thoroughfare was a major plus during our stay! Free Breakfast: A continental breakfast is served from 7:30-9:00 (or was it 7:00am?-- anyway, you get the idea) and had cereal, danishes, and a waffle maker, plus juice, milk, and coffee. Pretty simple, but plenty. :-) While we were there, they served breakfast at Prytania Oaks but sometimes serve it at the Prytania Park lobby-- they tell you at check-in where you can expect it to be each day on your stay. Other tips: If you have a car while in New Orleans and are able to explore more than just the French Quarter, take a drive down to the end of St. Charles and Magazine Streets in the Garden District area. The houses there are out of this world! Also, Metairie Cemetery is something to behold (wow!) and seeing Lake Pontchartrain just a few miles north of the city on Lakeshore Drive is worth the 18 minutes or so that it takes to get up there. It is so close by and is worth checking out at sunset if you have the benefit of having a car while there-- lovely! I loved exploring the streets of the French Quarter (the street performers are a hoot!) but have to admit that the 45 minute wait we had at Cafe Du Monde to get their world famous beignets (power-sugared covered donut treats) was a let-down. I still recommend you have a beignet while there though-- it is just a NOLA thing that you would not want to miss out on and, were it not for the long wait, I probably would have LOVED it! Just try to go later in the afternoon... after 4pm maybe... because the crowds just make the lines ridiculous any earlier in the day.

It was too hot to use it in June, but at another time of year, we could imagine sitting out there with our coffee in the morning and a stronger drink later.

The WWII museum is just a couple of stops away, and there are restaurants in the neighborhood that are much less expensive, quieter, and less crowded than those in the tourist areas. Very pleasant, very accommodating staff, although they should have more than one person on the desk at the check-in time.

If you want that classic old house feel, be sure to specify that in you reservation! But we were too tired to fight, and went to our room, which had a spiral staircase up to a laft with the second queen bed,which my daughter immediately claimed. The room was clean, a perfect temperature, had a small frig, microwave and coffee maker, and hair dryer. Big flat screen tv and blackout curtains, and my favorite, a power strip next to the bed so I could charge my phone, iPad, and Verizon hotspot modem and still use them from bed. Aahhhhhh!

The location is great, and within walking distance of many restaurants and even the French Quarter. Parking was readily available in the small lot right next door.

Not only was it a holiday weekend but also the time of the Essence Festival. Those hotels that weren't fully booked were superinflated!! Well, while surfing the net, I stumbled upon \"Bookit.com\". I had honestly, not ever heard of this site but man-oh-mah, I'm so glad that I was led to it, (of course, by the Holy Spirit). We were able to book our air/hotel and car accommodations, at one time and the cost was unbelievable. When I saw the price of \"The Prytania Oaks Hotel\", I was really sceptical, for it seemed to good to be true. Fortunately, I have family in New Orleans, (it's my birthplace), so one of my sisters and my eldest daughter, both were able to go to the hotel and check it out. They know that I rank cleanliness above all else and both delivered very favorable comments. So, I felt confident in my selection of this hotel. You know, how sometimes pictures can be deceiving? Well, not with this one. In fact, the room we stayed in looks EXACTLY like one pictured here. It was so nice and I felt as though we weren't staying in a hotel at all, but with family. Actually, we didn't spend much time with the service people, but the front desk ladies were very hospitable. One checks in at the front desk of The Prytania Hotel, which is just around the corner, from The Prytania Oaks Hotel. I'm told the former is like a regular hotel but the latter, has more of a B & B feel to it. Our room had a king-size bed, (just like the one that's pictured); beautiful wood floors and armoire; a flat-screen t.v.; marble tile in the bathroom...beautiful high ceilings and ceiling fan; a fireplace, (which appeared to be the original one)...everything was just as pictured. Even with the king-size bed, the bedroom and dressing area was very spacious and I loved the bathroom! I guess one can say that The Prytania Oaks has a modernized/19th century feel and a Howard Johnson's mentality...\"No surprises\". What you see, pictured here, is what you get...and that's a lot!! Everything was so nice and clean, (just the way I like it), that I made sure I cleaned behind my husband, each day we were there...so the service people literally had nothing to do but change the linen on the bed; exchange the soiled towels for clean ones and then do (very) minimal cleaning. I made sure our room looked as though no one was even staying there, (lol) and had we not had any service, the entire time we were there, it really would've been fine...that's just how clean it was and I kept it that way. We already had plans, so we really didn't get a chance to do anything in that neighborhood but the next time we're there...which will probably be in September 2009, we'll do the Delmonicos (Emeril's) thing and ride the street car. The neighborhood is a wonderful one and very typical of the pre-Katrina New Orleans that we knew and loved. The next time we're there, we plan to tour the \"Queen Anne\" hotel, which is adjacent to \"The Prytania Oaks\". I understand, either the 'Oaks' or The Queen Anne has accommodations for up to 8, which would be ideal, for when we have all our children and grandbabies with us. Also, I hope to arrive, earlier in September, so we can get a room with a balcony!!
