No reception desk, just a scruffy office with lots of boxes containing old printers etc laying about the place. On one wall was a big bank of keys, way to many just for this place, leading me to believe that this is some sort of letting agency. The three people working in the office just did'nt want to know & kept doing what they were doing. Eventually, one of them finished his foul-mouthed telephone converstion and gave us a key. This place is more a House in Multiple Occupation, NOT A HOTEL. In my job I inspect student accommodation and this place is just like a student house. I believe they just let a room if one is available at the time. I booked this place though hotels.com and on my return home they asked for a review, which I submitted approx 1 week ago, but up to press that review has not appeared on there web site and they still give this dump 7 out of 10 ! - I wonder why.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry", "Title": "\u201cWow, pretty bad.\u201d", "Author": "Eovce", "ReviewID": "UR16060374", "Content": "I'm not fussy when it comes to hotels but this was falling apart.

Our bathroom had a sink which was too small even for brushing your teeth, a shower which had been sealed incredibly badly and seemingly patched up (which would explain the huge damp patches and mould on the ceiling in various points throughout the hotel). Oh and the toilet seat wouldn't stay up!! The room itself had \"curtains\" which were full of holes and falling off the hooks, letting so much light in we couldn't sleep. They genuinely looked moth-eaten. Our blanket was full of cigarette burns and the whole room stank of damp. To add insult to injury, my husband decided to watch TV while I was in the shower. Yes, there was a TV as we had been told BUT the aerial plug was missing from the end of its cable, having been seemingly pulled off exposing bare wires. This added to the other bare wires and dodgy DIY fix jobs we saw elsewhere in the place. We had to wait around 15 or 20 minutes in a queue for breakfast, and then I had to wait another 10 minutes or so for my toast. My husband tells me the fried breakfast was the only good thing about the hotel and was fairly enjoyable!!

At \u00c2\u00a343/night for the double room and a location in Zone 2 North West London, this is a decent budget hotel. It looks like some decoration work was going on during our stay, with a few carpets having been taken off the stairs and a smell of paint all over the corridors. The interior of the hotel is reasonably old with torn/stained carpets and shabby furniture. The room was basic, with no view (actually it looked onto another window in the alleyway), no TV, phone and not even the \"tea making facilities\" so loved by the English. However, the ensuite bathroom was clean, the shower was warm and had good pressure and the bed was comfy. So altogether: an ugly room which performed all of its basic functions perfectly. The staff were all absolutely lovely, smiled a lot, were ready to chat and kept our bags safe when we turned up too early for check-in. The 2 most surprising good points (and turners for my review) were these: - Room Service. I wasn't expecting any, but while we were out the staff made our beds and brought fresh towels. - The Breakfast! Even though we turned up way late for breakfast on the Sunday (I'm sure they told me a different time....), we were immediately offered cooked breakfast. It's nothing spectacular (vegetarians get beans and scrambled egg), but still a surprise at that budget! They also have cornflakes and toast with butter, margarine, jam and honey. All in all, I would be happy to stay at the Belsize Park Hotel again when on a tight budget.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Belsize Park Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d619316-Reviews-Belsize_Park_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$119 - $151*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">42-45 Belsize Park</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">NW3 4EE</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "619316", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/93/22/93227c3a023b409d2e5b6f517b22b4018large.jpg"}}
