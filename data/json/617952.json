{"Reviews": [{"Content": "OK for sex tourism, otherwise SKIP If your thing is red-light district, you'll love this. Haven't done any voluntary research at all, but just by coming in and out of the hotel I think the red light district are 4 streets; well, Center Plaza is right down the middle of it! See photos added. There are dodgy characters around at all times, etc. The room I stayed in was not bad, good size and a nice bathroom (shower only, but nice) and it was clean. However, couldn't sleep much, as the bed was far too soft and weird (double beds are actually single beds/mattresses put together, really uncomfortable) and the red neon lights from Eros centre (opposite to the hotel) didn't help much either; to top it up, there was some noise on Friday night... Finally, to say that they have a gym is a joke; literally. 3 or 4 machines in a smelly basement (toilets on the same floor and horrible smell) do not constitute a gym; the same can be said for the sauna unit. 4 stars? Yeah, right. Perhaps Terrible is a bit harsh, but awful it was.", "Date": "Mar 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR216022037", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Ignvale"}, {"Content": "I had a 3 square meter hole for a room! I booked my room for 65 Euros through ebookers, which was the best price I could get for this hotel. I had been living previously in Frankfurt, and was not impressed of having to go through the red light district (which I do not find so impressive personnally, but I can understand that it might be not very pleasant to go through it at night). But what really I found outrageous is to have given me a 3 square meter so called bedroom (no joke, there was even no cupboard to hang your clothes., because there was no space for it...which is not compliant with a 4 star hotel rating as far as I know) . Moreover the room window was opened when I came in, and there was a smell of fried fish, as there is a japanese restaurant downstairs. I surely would not recommend this hotel, as for such a price, you can find much nicer 3 star hotels (but real 3 stars) and in much a nicer location.

We booked this hotel for a week but after two nights we decided to leave it due to the terrible service and location. I read many descriptions of the hotels location and not once did i read that it was in the red light district. It was extremely danderous to be in at night and unpleasant during the day especially early in the morning!! The street was full of drug addicts and prostitutes all the time!! The taxi driver was shocked at where we were staying!! We booked the hotel on condition that it had air conditioning but when we arrived our rooms were roasting and the air conditioner only made them hotter and more stuffy! We couldnt open the windows either because of all the screaming and sound of the clubs and brothels. The staff were rude and unhelpful, telling us that the air conditioning was being fixed when nothing was been done at all!! We couldnt have stayed there any longer and left to find a much nicer hotel!!

The location of the hotel is pretty close to the main train station what is very good when your arrival is by train, it is near the city centre but in a very hardcore red zone. When you walk into the city centre you have to go through a number of saunas, peep shows and sex shops. The rooms are acceptable but each morning, the linien and the towels lay on the corridor floor awaiting to be sorted to the rooms (there is no confusion, it's the clean ones that are on the floor).

We stayed here for a weekend in December. Initially we were quite impressed, until we looked around us and realised we were in the heart of the red light district and surrounded by brothels. The room was very clean and modern, the bathroom was very very small but clean. The mini bar was a huge fridge consisting of two bottles of beer!! Very mini! There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. The pillows were the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on, however I was brought another when requested. The reception staff were the rudest and most unhelpful I have ever met. They clearly could not be bothered and when we asked if they could reccomend a good german restaurant in Frankfurt we were told No as there were none!!! This was very wrong as we found two very nice restaurants on both nights!There is free internet access in the lobby which was good. The hotel bar was very modern however the service was terrible. My husband ordered two drinks and once the barman had served the first he then walked off and started decorating the christmas tree leaving my husband standing at the bar for ages, until another member of staff finally finished the order! We had the same drinks at the bar on both nights yet the second night it was two euros more!Breakfast was very limited and not very special. On the second morning there was no where to sit so we ended up propping ourselves up at the bar, not ideal. The area around the hotel was really not great. All day long there were prostitutes outside the hotel, admittedly they did not bother us at all but not what you want all the same. At night the area became even more unpleasant with drug pushers and prostitutes all over the place. On the first night when we were sat in the hotel bar I witnessed a homeless person exposing himself outside the window and he then proceeded to urinate up the wall!!!We choose to get taxis everywhere at night so we did not have to walk through the streets. The taxi driver seemed quite shocked when we asked him to take us to that area. He informed us that the area around the hotel was not at all safe after two in the morning due to the druggies and alcoholics in the street. Overall we had a lovely time in Frankfurt, especially the christmas markets. The hotel did not ruin our trip however we woud not choose to stay there again.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR751761552", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "cloggath"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel!
