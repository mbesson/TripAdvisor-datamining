The price was very reasonable - \u00a389 per night for a twin room through booking.com. The location was PERFECT. We were going to a gig in the Royal Albert Hall (Bright Eyes - it was fantastic!! :) , so we wanted somewhere near there, but besides that there was so much else in the area that makes it a perfect spot for tourists. It is a very nice part of town (you can almost SMELL the money from the locals, it's kinda funny seeing all the Ferraris and the likes dotted around the place, and all the rich posers trying to outdo each other! ;) There's lots of nice coffee shops and eateries in the area, albeit probably a little more expensive than other parts of town. You are right beside all the museums - which unfortunately I did not get to visit this time round as I was really sick for the entire stay - doubled over in agony with a kidney infection and barely managed to even make it through the gig at all - besides the gig I spent most of the stay in bed! :( But if I could do it over minus the crippling pain, I would definitely stay here again! The only negative I would mention is that the staff were really not very welcoming. I'm sure I looked a little worse for wear when I arrived, and for the entire time I was there - what with the incessant excruciating crippling pain I was experiencing! But our appearance should not have been an issue, we were paying guests and I really felt like they were looking down their noses at us - as i saw them being perfectly nice and friendly to the more glamorous guests! I'm sure if I went back there in full health and glammed up for a night on the town they would probably treat me differently, although if I do go back there I'll probably wear my scruffiest smelliest gym gear just to mess with the snobbish staff! ;)", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Hotel\u201d", "Author": "PoppyLiverpool", "ReviewID": "UR126738259", "Content": "We stayed for 2 nights at the Eden Plaza, we were allowed to check in early, we also received a free upgrade to a deluxe room, the staff were very helpful and knowledgable about the area, places to eat and best way to get around.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLand of the Lilliputs\u201d", "Author": "Laoise290288", "ReviewID": "UR126679105", "Content": "I don't think I've ever seen such small bedrooms.

I used to live in London for several years - I know there's a limit on space, but when you advertise a triple room in a space of just over 20m sq, you know you're not delivering a decent product. For the price that they're asking - look elsewhere. Just down the road is a fantastic NH hotel which we changed to after the second night (we asked to be uprgaded for the second night we stayed as it was impossible for us to be comfortable when there are 3 adults with the beds butted up against each other and a single 80cm wide corridor to store our luggage) which will offer you so much more for less money! The hotel is operated (and presumably owned) by an Indian gentleman who seems to only employ Indian people who find it completely normal to have avid conversations in Hindu right in front of you as you stand there for 2 minutes before being greeted. They told me I had to pay in advance, had already charged my card while I was back in Australia without my authorisation and told me what I could and couldn't do. I work in a 5 star property and have been in the luxury hotel industry for 9 years now. Funnily enough, the rubbish he was telling me about how he couldn't refund me because of the computer system he uses was in fact the very same system I have used in each property I work at so this hotel was deemed remarkably unprofessional in my eyes when I had to tell the man behind the counter how to do his job properly and advise him that I didn't appreciate the lies he was telling me and that I know for a fact how to rectify the error and continued to then explain to him where to go on the system to do this. In summary - you do not get what you pay for - this hotel is ridiculously marked up just for the location which is nice, but not essential. Everything in South Ken is so close I highly recommend you stay elsewhere and the lovely streets past cafes and pubs. To be paying as much as we did for a tiny and cramped room with incredible mould growth throughout the bathroom was an error of our judgement.

When I asked at the desk about it, they rather smuggly (like dodging good English with a lot of pointing, as well) said they did not have that service there and I would have to go down the street to a phone booth. Needing to conduct business with paperwork, I said that would not be acceptable and they just shrugged. I asked for a nice room with a view and did get a clean, albeit much-smaller-than-Rydges-Kensington room (where I had previously stayed) and had a good look out at a leafy tree canopy. Bad for me though, I forgot to add QUIET and was placed right on the corner of 2 busy intersections which, with no soundproof windows, caused sleepless nights, even on the 5th floor. Plus, they knew they were doing street construction when I arrived and I awoke to the sound of jackhammers early in the morning after the traffic finally died down at 2-3 am. Also, while I appreciate energy savings and the room key card-stand deal where everything shuts off when you leave the room, thsi was funny-bad to the extreme. The bathroom lights here shut off automatically after about 3 minutes and whether you are sitting or showering, you must wave your arms frantically or open and shut the shower doors to get them back on - frustrating, to say the least.

The continental breakfast was fine; hot drinks, juice, cereals, yogurts, fresh fruit, choice of breads and pasteries. We would rate this hotel as value for money in a brilliant location for sight seeing. For lunch or an evening meal we recommend Le Pain Quotidien at the bottom of Exhibition Road, on the corner with Thurloe Place - wonderful fresh food at a good price, then a stroll along Thurloe Place to the pub for a few drinks!", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the money\u201d", "Author": "lyss820", "ReviewID": "UR90524422", "Content": "I think had I stayed here first on my trip with nothing else to compare it to, I would have said, eh... it did the trick. It's a warm roof over my head in a great part of town. The service is crap, and the front desk man scolded my husband and asked him why he didn't tell them that we would need a cab the night before (instead of that morning--by the way, we didn't because when we asked they said just to let them know about 15 minutes before we needed a cab). The rooms are tiny, the bathrooms are surprisingly spacious given the size of the rooms. The bathrooms looked exceptionally clean, but at closer glance, our bathroom floors looked like it needed slightly better cleaning (black and brown spots). Internet was extremely choppy and when we ran into airline problems, they wouldn't let us use the phones in the room to call out. I guess it 'does the job'. HOWEVER, for the same price, we stayed at a Bed & Breakfast but a few miles from here in Vauxhall called 69TheGrove and for the same price, we were given unlimited, barely-ever-choppy internet, free homemade breakfast (by the owner), and much much more friendlier service and bigger, cleaner rooms. I guess for an emergency type of option, Eden Plaza works, but if you're looking to spend the same amount of money for a much better option, you're better off looking at Bed & Breakfasts, first, where the workers and owners actually care about the facilities and their guests!", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northamptonshire", "Title": "\u201cNewly Refurbed but Noisy\u201d", "Author": "AbiSomeone", "ReviewID": "UR90364531", "Content": "One nice thing about being in a newly refurbished hotel is that everything is 'new'. The Power shower was WONDERFUL with plenty of hot water! The beds were nice and firm. However, the rooms were quite small and noisy. I don't know if it's because we got 'bargain rooms' or not, but our Double room was between floors in the stairwell, and the double bed was shoved against the wall, with little floor space. The Twin room for the teenagers had the beds end to end on one wall. The hotel is situated on the corner of Queen's Gate and Cromwell, and the traffic seemed non-stop, even on a snowy weekend. (Having our iPod with speakers and playing a white noise (ocean waves) helped us to go to sleep with the traffic noise. For our teens whose room did not face the street, they had problems ALL night with very loud and noisy neighbors. (They now know to call the front desk in this case, for future reference.) The location was across the street from the wonderful Natural History Museum, and in between two Tube (Metro) stations. I think the Gloucester Road station is closer, with great places to eat and quick shopping for necessities. We ate at Paul's Patissierie, the great little restaurant two doors down from Paul's for breakfast (went there twice but cannot remember the name) which had fresh squeezed OJ. The Stanhope Arms pub was wonderful as well, for atmosphere, food and drinks (we found out later that they had cheaper breakfast)! We had a delightful trip in London during the snow storm, but would have also liked a restful, QUIET night's sleep. If noise doesn't bother you, this is a great place to stay as the beds are not worn down and the shower is wonderful. It's in a beautiful neighborhood of Kensington in London and convenient, and the staff was friendly. I hesitate to recommend due to noise, but it was a decent price and nice and clean.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Townsville, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Affordable, Clean and Newly Refurbished\u201d", "Author": "HappyAussieCamper", "ReviewID": "UR88657770", "Content": "I didn't know what to expect when I booked this hotel.

I called the hotel immediately and explained that if the hotel was not up to the standards detailed we would not be staying and would require a full reund. The receptionist explained that the hotel had been refurbished and we were welcome to view the rooms prior to check in, if at this stage we were not happy we could get a refund - we did exactly this.

As you walk down the road it is last corner on the left before the start of the history museem on your right. Its the ideal place to stay as there are restaurants near by and things to do. Hotel- I think it has probably been done up quite recently, everything is new and stylish. The lobby is Clean, tidy with a smiling face ready to help and welcome you. The room was a little small, long and thin. It was fine for my mother and I just for a weekend but if your staying longer its not ideal. The room was clean and tidy and kept that way. Our beds were comfortable, had a lovely en-suite. Again it was small but enough- Shower was amazing! Staff- They can't do enough for you.
