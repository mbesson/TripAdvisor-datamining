Found this hotel through Trip Advisor comments. We were not disappointed. This is a great little hotel. Hotel management were very helpfull. Service overall was great. Rooms spacious, clean, well laid out, good bathroom and serviced daily. Tip: Ask for room (non-smoking) on a top floor. We were on the 5th floor. Reason being you can sometimes hear the Metro underground as it goes under the hotel. Not enough noise to disturb your sleep though! We found the hotel ran its air conditioning / heating on the 'hotter' side. At night we turned the heater temp. down in our room but it made no difference. No problem though, we just openned a bedroom window and let the fresh air in. If req'd the hotel internet is 5E for 15mins. Took us awhile to get familiar with the French format keyboard!. We did not eat at the hotel. Tip: There are three little restaurant's just across the road from the Hotel front door. Recommend the middle one, very reasonable prices, meals great. We did breakfast on the run each moring. There are hundreds of little coffee cafe's around there. Hotel very central to everything. Metro only 50 metres away. Galeries Lafayette shops and Opera 10 mins walk. Lourve and Monet museums 10-15mins walk through the Jardin des Tuileries . River 10mins. Notre Dame and Latin Quarter 15mins walk. We metro'd to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es for shopping and did an easy stroll back (30mins). Tip: Depending on how long you are in Paris buy a Metro Travel Pass for 2,3 or 5 days. It will pay for itself the first day. I recall the 5 day Metro Travel Pass was 45E. You can easy get it at any Metro station direct from a ticket machine. The Metro goes everywhere and is very easy to use. Get a Metro map off the internet before you go. The metro trains run every couple of minutes. Metro out to see the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Basilica and surrounding area full of artisits (get off at Pigelle Metro). It's near the Moulin Rouge nightclub area. Also check out the Canal St-Martin area. It's worth a look to get off the tourist trail. The Eiffel Tower and H\u00f4tel des Invalides (Emperor Napoleon's Tomb and what's got to be the best Army museum in Europe) should not be missed. Unless you plan to do 'a lot' of museum's we cannot recommend the Museum Pass (its rather expensive). We'd been to Paris before so wanted to do something different so we did the 'Tour Under (i.e. underground) the Effiel Tower' and the Roland Garros tennis stadium tour. Reservations are required for the Roland Garros tour. Book direct with the stadium. We did by email. Both very interesting. You tour right into the players rooms, etc. We also booked a 'tour' to have dinner in one of the Effiel Tower restaurants and then a River cruise. Tip: Book and take yourself to the Tower for dinner and cruise. The 'Tour' consisted of going to meet the bus, the bus then drove about 3 km to the Tower, a guide took us up to the restaurant, got us seated at our table, gave us the tickets for the cruise, pointed out where to catch the boat and then left! The restaurant was nice, average 3 course fixed meal and a bottle of average red between 4. We were sitting on tables of 8. Did'nt matter where you sat you still got a good view. The restaurant was only half full. I'm advised there is normally no trouble getting in on non-public holidays. After dinner we walked from the Tower over to the River (5mins) to catch the boat. No priority here. Just lined up with 200 other people to get on the boat and did the 'public' cruise. The cruise itself was fine. The 'tour' did not include return travel to your hotel so on return of the cruise we just Metro'd back to the hotel. In all we's classify the 'tour' as a 'rip off'. If you have not been to Paris before take your walking shoes. Paris is a city you can easy walk around. Once we'd Metro'd somewhere we just walked everywhere. Get some good walking maps like the ones in the Frommers Paris guide. We did and really enjoyed just 'touring' by ourselves off the tourist track. The only big tour we did this time was a day trip to view the abbey of Mont St-Michel on the Normandy coast. Its a 14 hrs round trip but worth every minute of it once you get there. It's a 'bucket list' item you must tick off. Back on the hotel: We loved it and will stay there again on our return to Paris late 2012.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWell run, good location\u201d", "Author": "dsdvn", "ReviewID": "UR127186901", "Content": "Clean, well sound-proofed, recently refurbished, spacious, welcoming.

Had booked a family room via ebookers.com but was upgraded due to a coincidental double booking. We were given 2 interconnecting rooms (56 & 57) instead and we're really delighted with the size and comfort. Excellent beds in both rooms and exceptionally clean bathrooms. Very quiet at night time too although I am not surprised the streets were so quiet on 31st and 1st as New Year's Eve was basically cancelled in Paris! No fireworks whatsoever and shops all boarded up on the Champs Elysee at 6/7pm. Huge disappointment but I digress. The metro was only a soothing distant rumble and did not cause us any issues with sleeping. Breakfast was good with a nice array of choices. However, the hot food only consisted of sausages and very dry scrambled egg. This needs attention as does the number of tables in the small breakfast area. There are too many and it is therefore very cramped. There are plenty of good places to grab breakfast though round the corner from the hotel. Excellent free wi-fi access and lovely staff. Gripes: hot breakfast choices, only 2/3 English speaking TV channels. Expensive mini-bar. Booking did say we were supposed to have a Nespresso machine in the room but there wasn't and the air-conditioning was not working so we just opened the window and yes we had the window open all night and noise still was not an issue.

The subway noise that has been mentioned in previous posts was a non issue, sounding like an occasional distant rumble of thunder. The bathroom was great and very spacious. TV only has two english speaking stations (BBC and CNN), but you should not spend much time in your room in Paris, right? The folks at the desk were very helpful with recommendations and helping to make reservations at restaurants when needed, as well as advice on the metro. Umbrellas were available to borrow if needed. We did not have the breakfast there so cannot comment on that. Bad things? There wasn't a lot of storage space to unpack your clothes on to shelves in the closet, and there was no dresser drawers. Also, we had some problems with the heat in the room and did not discover how to adjust the heat radiating from a heat panel in the room until a few days into the visit. Also, there is construction going on in a building behind the hotel, and that will wake you up somewhere around 730 AM.... none of these things are deal breakers or should keep you from staying here.

We could hear the rumble of the metro when it was quiet, but these slight noises don't trouble us. The only issue that might cause light sleepers a problem is that the street lamp sits directly outside the second floor windows and casts a bright orange halogen glow into the room unless the curtains a firmly closed.

The room size was much, much larger than anticipated, considering its in-city location. Arrived several hours in advance of the check in time, but, luckily, the room was ready, and check in was a breeze.

Because of the hotel's extremely convenient location -- a mere 10-minute walk from the Louvre and the Batobus stop (highly recommend the multi-day pass so you can hop on / hop off at any of their eight, conveniently located docks near all the big attractions along the Seine) -- it is a great \"home base\" from which to explore all of Paris. In fact, because of this location, I was able to visit the Louvre, Musee de l'Orangerie, Ile de la Cite / Notre Dame, the Bastile, Place de Vogues, Statue de la Liberty, Tour Eiffell, Musee d'Orsay, Musee Rodin, Invalides, Musee de l'Armee and the Petit & Grand Palais in 3 days!

The hotel is well located for seeing the major sights & only a short (10min) walk from The Louvre whilst being literally around the corner from Place de La Concorde & Madeleine Church. It is located down a somewhat fairly busy side street just around the corner from the Concorde Metro Station. The desk staff were absolutley first rate. Very friendly, spoke excellent English, very helpful & keen to help. The hotel is quite small & intimate (only 36 or so rooms) but the rooms are very large given normal Parisienne standards. Bathrooms & toilets were en-suite, quite small but well furnished. The room had a mini bar which was regularly stocked & reasonably priced given the cost of drinking in bars in Paris. If you want to stock your own food & drink in the mini fridge, then the hotel has no apparant problem with you doing this. The desk staff offered me a map & gave me advice about which Metro to catch to see the sights I wanted to - all without any prompting. In line with previous reviews, the Metro does indeed run underneath the hotel but this is no more than a faint rumble every 30 mins, so faint that the TV drowns it out. We were on the 2nd floor & were not bothered by it. The rooms have double glazed windows so traffic noise is kept out. The thick curtains prevent any street light from entering the room. The room had 2 lots of double French doors opening onto a small balcony overlooking the street. The rooms are a little tired but more importantly they are clean. The bed was large & comfortable with nice pillows, we had no problems sleeping. The restaurant across the street - The Royal Madaleine - is as good as any. Try the Onion Soup. It's served in a large bowl with lot's of croutons & topped with a thick layer of cheese. It's only a starter but is virtually a meal on it's own. Incidentally, I'm sure the hotel room service uses this restaurant as the menu is exactly the same items & price & we often saw the restaurant owner running across the road to the hotel with plates covered in foil. The rack rate at the hotel was 360 Euros - we paid half that amount. In truth I would have been disappointed had I paid the full amount but given the price we paid versus the general price of hotels in Paris I was more than satisfied.

My only recommendation is asking for a room on a high floor because the metro runs right underneath the hotel. Also I was reading some other reviews and people commented on the breakfast area being to small. Well, it is very small but you're in Paris, you should wake up early and stop at a bakery and have a croissant and coffee and then be on your way.

For 4 nights during the last week in September 2006. We checked in a couple hours early, as we had to escape from our previous horrible hotel as soon as possible. To our surprise and delight, they had upgraded us from a superior room to their best suite AND it was ready! After the horrible treatment we had from our last hotel (Hotel Costes, K: feel free to read my review) this almost made me cry, I was so thankful. Check-in staff was friendly, polite and informative. We found that all the staff that we ran into during the course of our stay was just as pleasant. The room we received was huge! It had a separate living room with full-size sofa bed & 2 chairs, a long buffet/desk and even a fold out dining table. The bedroom was large, bed was comfortable and it had a spectacular city view with a cute little balcony with table & chairs. Bathroom was very spacious, clean and with all mod cons including a separate toilet room. Being American, I\u2019m used to larger hotel rooms, but here in the middle of the night, I was a little lost finding my way to the loo! Huge closet \u2013 although it was located in the living room. Safe and mini fridge was nice. The business center was very small \u2013 the size of a phone booth, but I was glad that they at least had one as we left the laptop at home. We didn\u2019t try the restaurant unfortunately, so I can\u2019t comment about that. As reported by previous reviewers, the only con was the proximity to the metro. I live in the city and am used to the usual city noises, but although the metro in itself was not all that loud, it was the shaking that concerned me most - especially being from So. California where any type of building shaking is not good! The shaking caused some rattling noises, which by the second night we pinpointed were coming from the balcony furniture & teapot. After moving these around a bit, the rattling stopped. Still, the shaking did wake me up a couple of times during the night. Had it not been for this, I believe that this hotel would be most excellent and very worth the price. Clean & comfortable rooms, efficient & polite service and charming and desirable location. A bit of warning: We went to the restaurant directly below the hotel and were insanely overcharged for beverages (15 E or $22, one glass of warm water 9.5 E or $14.25; and one glass of table wine 16.5 E or $33). To add injury to insult, we became sick from the food (roasted chicken) for the rest of the night and into the next morning.", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, But Be Warned If You Plan to Stay on a Weekend!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5330768", "Content": "My husband and I recently stayed in the Richepanse for four nights in early June. The location is excellent - very close to most of the major attractions in Paris. Our room was clean and comfortable, with a good sized bathroom. In addition, the front desk staff were more than accommodating, pleasant and helpful, especially by suffering through my atrocious French. However, the noise from the Metro station was significant, and most disturbingly, the street noise was intolerable on the nights when the young Parisians were out to party. There is a nightclub just around the corner of the hotel, and the club didn't close until 5:30am! On Saturday night, there were literally dozens drunken people that staggered down the street in front of the hotel to catch the Metro until the nightclub closed at 5:30am. We were unable to sleep at all that night, as huge numbers of people were yelling, breaking bottles, fighting and even urinating against the walls of the buildings opposite the hotel. At one point as we watched several young people involved in a particularly violent altercation, I was truly frightened, and it felt like we were witnessing a riot. When we questioned the desk clerk about the noise, this appeared to be a common occurrance. So if you are staying over a Friday or Saturday night, be aware that you may not sleep much! In addition, the hotel is difficult for taxi drivers to find as the street name (Rue de Chevelier de St. George) seems to also be known as Richepanse on some of the older maps. So while we thought that this hotel had many great things going for it, was certainly reasonably priced, and in a fantastic location, we cannot recommend it to other travellers if you are staying over a weekend.", "Date": "June 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant stay in the centre of Paris\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5187923", "Content": "We spent a week at the Opera Richepanse back in October 2005 and had a very pleasant stay.

Yes, there is a slight rumble every 30 minutes or so, but we found it only little distractive or annoying. The staff was extremely cordial and helpful and everyone (including the night porter) had very good command of the English language. The only (minor) drawback was the fact that the hotel didn't feature a wireless internet access, as it has become pretty much the standard in 3+ star hotels in Paris. The hotel's location is great and perfect for short-time breaks, as most attractions are within walking distance, this includes Place de la Concorde, Louvre, Les Halles, Place Vendome, Jardin des Tuileries, L'Opera and Champs Elys\u00e9es - all reachable by foot within 5 to 20 minutes.

This helped, but you could still hear the Metro under the hotel. Overall, however, I think that the hotel is fantastic - the staff, the location, the cleanliness and upkeep were all top notch. These vastly outshined any noise from outside the hotel. Yes our stay was still a bit noisy, but welcome to Paris. If you are coming to Paris and are a light sleeper, bring your earplugs and be prepared to pay for a room on the top floor of your hotel because I believe that no hotel in Paris can guarantee a noiseless stay.
