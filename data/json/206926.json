Easy to get to from the Aerobus (literally 2 minutes walk). There is a small reception (no lobby, which would have been nice) and the breakfast room/restaurant is in the basement. There is a small cafe/bar attached to the hotel and you can charge things to your room. It was never very busy, but it may have been a bit more lively later in the evening (not open on Sundays). Our room was on the 3rd floor, at the front and was absolutely fine. Clean, modern-ish and big enough for two, with a small desk, flat screen telly, double bed (two singles pushed together). Also a minibar, and although they didn't publicise the prices, we had some of the water and it wasn't horribly expensive. There is free wifi (although a bit of a weak signal in our room) and satellite telly, although we could only get 3 English language channels- all of them news. The bathroom was spotless, with a good shower (and bath) and some nice toiletries. I concur with other reviewers that it can be noisy. People out in the corridor sounded like they were in our bathroom. Also could hear people stomping around above. Luckily we had an elderly couple next door so no noise from them. Although our room faced the street, it wasn't that bad - from past visits to Spain I was aware of the late night rubbish collection so as long as we opened the windows after 11 pm, we were fine. Saturday night was a definite window-closed night though - people yelling, fighting etc. There is air conditioning in the room. Breakfast was a buffet of hot and cold food, with some Spanish specialities. Great opening hours - breakfast served until 11! The only let down was the coffee machine - you had to take your cup up to the machine and get splattered by the coffee dispenser and then carefully get back to your table without spillage. Otherwise, plenty of fresh food and nice decor.

We stayed here for 6 nights and it was difficult to sleep. I am not a light sleeper and I live in New York City across the street from a 24/7 diner so I think I'm a pretty good judge of what constitutes as too much noise. My boyfriend and I were woken up several times a night every night. There is a skate park nearby that has people screaming into megaphones until around 4am. In addition to this, if someone so much as tiptoes in the hallway, you WILL hear it. The walls are PAPER THIN. I could hear people's conversation LOUD AND CLEAR from the bedroom next door -- I took to whispering a lot so as to avoid people listening in on my conversations. I was woken up every morning by someone walking down the hall. It was very very disturbing to me. Ridiculous noise levels aside, the hotel is superb. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and modern, the staff is friendly and speaks great english, the location is really incredible (2 blocks from Las Ramblas!!). These things really can compensate for some of the lost sleep time. If you are going to sightsee like I was, then you should request a room that doesn't face the street to avoid SOME of the noise and possibly bring some ear plugs just in case. It really is a great hotel and everything is so close by and accessible. Really great neighborhood too.

Inside we could here everything that was going on in the adjacent rooms and corridors. We had a second floor room facing the street and had to ask to be moved to the back of the hotel so that we could get some quiet. On the plus side the breakfasts were good with a selection of food. The cafe was reasonable and served some good food. Staff were unenthusiastic and carried out their duties without grace. We felt as though we were just numbers filling the room.

A better option may be the Airbus that stops at Plaza Universitat which is just 2 mins from Hotel and will take around 35 mins. The hotel has a secure door for entry so you need to buzz in for added security. What I did not like about the hotel was safety deposit box was extra at eur4.50 per day. I normally expect this to be free in rooms, but perhaps is the norm in Spain. There also seemed to be some noise comming from other rooms so I presume the walls are not to sound proofed but not excessive. The front desk was very friendly & efficiant and very good english spoken. The rooms were clean and not to small. Bathroom bright and large. View from front windows look straight into appartmnets accross small road so not to private with curtains open. Double bed was 2 singles pushed together though may not be in all rooms.

Our room was on the top floor (fifth floor) and we heard some occasional noise from outside and the other rooms but most of the time it was quiet. The room was OK. I read from an earlier review that the beds are really firm and that was true! They were a bit too firm for me but if you like firm beds then it's no problem. We booked a non-smoking room but there was an ashtray in the room and a strong deodoriser smell when we arrived, but no cigarrette smell. There was plenty of cupboard space and the bathroom was nice and spacious. However, you had to pay extra if you wanted to use the safe.

There was a nice selection of fruit juices, cereals, pastries plus about eight hot items from scrambled egg to bacon, mushrooms and sausages. All very tasty, although the coffee was not quite to my liking! Eating out prices are about on a par with the UK, but be warned the bars on the main streets can be quite pricey.

You can't keep your curtains open if you don't want people leering in your room, it's right across from the H10 Gravina Hotel (which is MUCH nicer, we stayed there last time). The room itself was small & only 2 twin beds were avaiable, they DID NOT join together well! The decor is old & run down. And the walls are thin, we constantly heard people in the hallway and street traffic kept us up at night. Also, my husband & his co-worker were there for a conference and only recieved 1 of 3 wake up calls (the one that was made came 30 minutes late). This resulted in them being late on a day they were supposed to speak, very bad situation! I do not reccomend this hotel, unless there is no other option!
