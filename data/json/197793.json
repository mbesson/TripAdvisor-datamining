It is perfectly located: less than 10 min walk from train station, 3 min walk from Warmoestraat (heart of red light district), 5 min walk from Dam Square and from tram station where you can trains to almost main attraction in the city. Hotel is situated along a very nice canal, at the border of the red light district. Neighbourhood is not really noisy even during week end. I travelled alone but booked a double room to have more space. Room was lovely. It seemed it was recently refreshed. Had a nice view on the canal. It was not really big and i think it could be a bit small for 2 people as there is not a lot of space to move around the bed and to store the suitcase. There is only one sink in the bedroom. Shower and toilets are shared. Shower looked old but clean. Toilets were very clean too. In the bedroom closet is rather small to put the clothes. There was also no dustbin. Room are not really soundproof as I could hear my neighbour snored at night as if he were in my room. WIFI is available in every room and worked well. Breakfast served from 9 am to 11 am. It is continental. It is ok. The second day I arrived in the breakfast room at 8.58 am. The guy at the reception desk was just arriving and told me in a very rude way that breakfast was served at 9 am. I said I did not mind waiting . Then he started mumbling in dutch and looked really angry. So I decided to have my breakfast outside. in the morning I rather have a quiet atmosphere to have my coffee. The day after the same guy had a kind behaviour. Really weird. Except this guy, the rest of the staff were very kind and helpful. I paid EUR 99 per night. I found this a bit expensive regarding the service offered, the room without bathroom. Single room is EUR 70. I think it is a bit expensive too. I had the opportunity to have a look inside one single: it was a bit dark as located at the back of the building, the sink was old and had some stains. The mirror above was broken. This hotel is not a bad option to stay but not the best quality for value.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cTo Be Avoided at All Costs (Literally and figuratively)\u201d", "Author": "wanderingtheworld200", "ReviewID": "UR123017412", "Content": "I had a 14 hour layover in AMS so I went into the city which I have been to before. I went to this hotel and walked in. Nobody was there. So, I then looked downstairs and the receptionist was lying on the couch sleeping. I asked a couple of times if he had rooms...no answer. Then he woke up and asked how I got in. I said the door was opened. I asked if they had rooms (on a Monday night) and he said no. Then when we were walking upstairs I asked him again knowing that the Christmas/New Year travel season was over and he said he had rooms...opened up the key holder and presto, most of the keys were hanging there meaning they were far from filled. He was the most inconsiderate, rude, nasty person I think I have ever dealt with at a hotel. The price of the hotel was taken down to 70 euro. I was then told at 10pm the hotel closes and that I would need to let myself in and out with the key. This was ok. Since I needed to be back at Schipol by 6am I asked if I could have a wake up call and he said no. Then I said I need to find a place that has wake up calls. He then said he would get me an alarm clock. Mind you, the 70 euro room rate is for a room that has a shared bathroom and shower. As many rooms in AMS are small due to the lateral configurations, I expected it to be small but this was on the verge of ridiculous. The room had a sink, a broken cheap \"closet\", a bed, and a small tv. The view was good as it was on the third floor overlooking a canal. The location is excellent as it is about a ten minute walk from the Amsterdam Centraal Station which has trains leaving constantly and taking 15-20 minutes each way. Would I recommend this hotel?

Excellent location right in the redlight district of the city, only 5mins walk from \"Bloedstraat\" (shemale area of redlight district!) so ideal if thats your thing! There is a coffee shop a few doors up which i didnt actually visit as there is loads of others with 5 mins walk. There is also a handy take away (burgers chips etc.) on the corner of the street. As for noise i had a room facing the court yard so was very peacefull, cant see it being that nosiey if your facing the street its not a very busy street. As for the stairs ive heard a few others mention they are steep and a tight spiral but its really not a issue adds to the charm of the place to be honest. The staff where friendly although i didnt have much to do with them apart from checking out and in. Its no smoking but on my last night i had a couple of J's out the window and no one noticed. Ive heard a few people metion the breakfast is good...its not to be honest was just a fired egg on toast (need a couple slices of bacon or a couple of sauasages to go with it!) As for meeting other like minded guys i think i went at the wrong time of year as the hotel seemed pretty empty, i left my door open a few times in the hope of meeting someone but no one was around! About half an hour before i was due to check out in a last dicth effort to meet somone i decided to leave the shower curtain open and door to the shower open (opens on to corridoor) and someone did join me!! Upon arrival at central station i decided to get a taxi to the hotel to save getting lost/reading a map i would advise against this as it cost 20 euro and it is litlary a 15 min walk and easy to find.

The great thing about the 'Anco' is the friendly and relaxed attitude of the managers and staff. They are extremely nice, respectful and always there to help or have a chat with. And they are upgrading their hotel all the time... just when I left my bed was going to be replaced by a new one with spring-mattress. And a lot of rooms already have a flatscreen tv.

The Anco is not good, the rooms are basic, and the staff could not have been less helpful or inviting. Would it kill Will on the front desk to smile or be at least a little friendly? There is also no such thing as room service, with the bed left unmade during my entire stay. If you also like guys cruising around the hotel at all hours of the night, looking for an open door and a willing fellow guest, then this place is your idea of fun. It wasn't mine and I would never return here. It is also in the midst of the red light district, which is an awful, noisy area. For this price, you can do much better in Amsterdam. Keep shopping for somewhere better.

It is a very basic hotel and clean. There is only one room with private facilities. The staff are friendly. The guests are like anywhere else - it depends on the effort you put in. Mostly leather guys and skinheads go there so if that's what you're in Amsterdam for, great. It's also very close to the leather bars. The only problem we had was with noise. As it is in the red light area, there are prostitutes all around and these attract gangs of noisy young straight guys, some in cars with music pounding. There are also lots of drug dealers. Personally I didn't feel all that safe walking back to the hotel. In the hotel, there's a lot of movement with guys cruising each other - any room with an open door can attract attention and so be prepared for very little sleep.", "Date": "May 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cAnco Hotel is Great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1662151", "Content": "Just got back from Amsterdam and a few days at the Anco.
