Unfortunately we stayed at the Queens Hotel. After leaving the Airport we tarvelled by taxi through magnificent streets and buildings and slowly decended onto what some might call shanty area of Dubai. On arrival to hotel (late at night) we had a small number of steps to negotiate with our luggage into what at first seemed a nice hotel reception, the rating by our travel agents said it was 3+ star the notice outside said 2 star, the reception is where all the expectaions ended, it took 30 mins to book in we were the only ones there. we were then taken to our rooms by lift, a very small lift, the rooms were very very small, and had balcony which only catered for 2 people standing looking over what i can only describe as a building converted into a washing line. The street around the hotel was very conjested and full of rubish. Our bathroom area within our room was so dirty we did not even dare to wash in it deciding to wait until we got to our ship. The bath plughole was choked with hair and grease. Breakfast which was served beside the \"pool area\" was disgusting, boiled eggs, bread, tomatoes, curry thing, and some kind of fungus which was supposed to be mushrooms, self serve tea and coffee. The tables were dirty as was the cutlery and the area around the pool was in a total state of disrepair. Broken window blinds covered with paper, broken chairs etc etc. we could not wait to get out quick enough. When we departed we approached the reception to ask if they would get us a taxi to the ship, they totally refused and told us to find our own outside. I would not go back to this or recommend this hotel to anyone, thankfully we only had to stay there 1 night.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Khartoum, Sudan", "Title": "\u201cCenter\u201d", "Author": "RihabMysaraHassan", "ReviewID": "UR121570263", "Content": "very cloth to the shops, location in Deira, the central buisness in Dubai.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abuja, Nigeria", "Title": "\u201cbasic\u201d", "Author": "ixagee", "ReviewID": "UR106806924", "Content": "if you are expecting a \"home, away from home\" experience, don't bother. not impressed with the hygiene, had an unwashed tumbler, on the bed stand, for the five nights, i spent there.

Stayed here for 3 nights, 2nd floor room 205 The entrance and halls are all marble and very clean and tidy, pleasent staff, helpful and polite. The room (very small room) had tv with English channels, fridge and bathroom with shower. As another review stated, the windows could be updated, mine was infact not possible to close so the noise on the outside would have been bad had I not been wearing earplugs so i cant really complain. The noise of the mosque is very evident but neccassary for the country and is harmless for the few minutes that the sound lasts for. The area can be a little strange if you were expecting a tourist area. ALL the people in this area are Asian. They go about their daily business and ignore you unless you ask for something. The internet cafe is across the road, 2dh for 1 hour, not bad huh. the shops are all Asian, the usual crap you would find in a market. The planes do go over but again the earplugs do the trick at night. getting a taxi from the corner is a little tricky expecially in the morning and late afternoon, dont leave getting to the airport to chance, you will miss your flight. Overall I liked this hotel alot for the money I paid, I loved the area as it was so different to anything I have seen and I would go back there again on a budget.

Situated in the Deira district it is just a couple of minutes walk from many of 'old Dubai's' major attractions, including the gold and spice souks. Queens is one of the few moderately priced accommodation options available this audaciously cashed up city. We paid about $150 for a twin room. The room was clean and comfortable, albeit a little small. It had private bathroom, air conditioning, phone and daily housekeeping service. A two star establishment, Queens included the basic provisions associated with this rating. Some of these are: a tour desk, safety deposit box, wake-up call, swimming pool, 24 hour check in, snooker table, laundry, dry cleaning, a restaurant and room service. The food was mediocre, overpriced and by the time it eventually arrived at our door it was a bit cold into the bargain! There are plenty of much better dining options within easy walking distance. Queens is not the hotel for visitors seeking a luxurious accommodation experience. It is a decent place to sleep for us, who would rather spend our dollars on shopping, shopping and more shopping in the city's bazaars and glitzy modern malls! It is also a good choice for people interested basing themseles in Dubai\u2019s atmospheric historic heart, where touts crowd the pavement selling \u201cgenuine fakes\u201d and the scent of frankincense drifts heavily on the sultry evening air.

The staff in the hotel are also very helpful and keep the rooms very clean the sheets and towels are changed daily the rooms are a bit dated but its to be expected as it is very inexpensive to stay here. The breakfast is very basic but is more than exceptable. There are a couple of hotels near by who serve alcohol Sandras Inn (which has a restaurant and bar called the golden fork food here is average but really cheap \u00a35 for fillet steak and chips and wine for \u00a38.50 a bottle), Hyatt regency, Picadilly... the staff on reception will be happy to point u in the rite direction, one evening we got a cab to the irish village which is near dubai airport this was nice but ALOT more expensive than other alcohol serving places, in saying that the alcohol and food prices range from very cheap to sometimes over priced. For me the most worthwhile place to eat was in the near by hyatt regency, on the 25th floor there is a revolvong restaurant that has a 3 course ala carte buffet for 170dirhams or \u00a325pp (and a bottle of white wine was about 140dirham or \u00a320) both the food and the view was spectacular, also worth a visit but a little pricier is the famous Burj we had lunch in the Al Iwan restaurant which works out at 325dirham or \u00a347pp for a similar 3 course buffet and about \u00a334 for a bottle of wine the only reason it seems most people eat there is that without a reservation you cannot get in to see the hotel it really is worth seeing. Afternoon tea is also an option but was fully booked when we tried to make a reservation it works out at 225dirhams or \u00a332pp. taxis in dubai are very cheap but the city especially the deira area is very congested with traffic all taxis are metered but when using them everyday it does take its toll on your spending money about a 3mins walk from the Queens hotel is the gold souk bus station here you can get a bus to almost any where in dubai eg No 8 bus brings you from here to the Burj or Jumeriah area for about 25p 1way the buses are very comfortable as they are fully air conditioned only problem i found with them was the first 12 seats are for women and the rest of the bus is for men, men are allowed stand on the bus but women are not so gettin a bus from the gold souk was no problem as the buses start at this station empty and as u can imagine 12 seats fill up very quickly so its not always possible for a women to be able to use the bus much to my ANNOYANCE!!! and ofcourse the poor women who live and work there. As the city is so huge and spread out i would definately recommend the big bus tour its the usual hop on hop off and one of the stops is Ski dubai which is definately worth seeing it cost 150dirhams or \u00a322 and leaves from the nearby gold souk station. The hotel does have its own restaurant but no alcohol we didnt eat here so i cant comment but it is really inexpensive. The pool is in my eyes is not worth even being there it seems clean and looks nice but is not heated and is built on the 2nd floor with walls surrounding it therefore no sun i didnt see one oerson in it the whole week, but the jumriah beach park about 20mins from the hotel is fab 70p to get in and the \u00a32 for a sun lounger i, not usually a fan of beachs but this is an exception totally clear water, no sea weed or fish or anything really nice and a golden sand.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "lagos", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "deeeee", "ReviewID": "UR5692162", "Content": "The Hotel was okay considering the price paid, the rooms were very neat, although a bit on the small side in size, bedsheets and towels were changed every day, I went with my kids and they had a lovely time using the swiming pool.
