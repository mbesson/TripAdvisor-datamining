The staff of the hotel is very courteous and helpful. Since the hotel commenced operations about 2 years back, it is neat and clean. The room service of the hotel was also very prompt and efficient. The location of the hotel is almost 30 minutes away from the city center and the airport, but, it is about 10 minutes away from Mall of the Emirates. Here, you can catch the Dubai Metro. So, in my opinion, the location is not a drawback. The biggest disappointment with the hotel was its breakfast buffet. I understand that the components of the breakfast buffet have to be limited to the number of juices, fruit items, bakery items etc. But, they could at least change the items within the limits of number of items. For example, they had watermelon juice and 2 other juices every day! At best, they would change only 2 dishes in the buffet. Rest of the dishes would remain the same! Moreover, it is obvious that their chef is from South India. Because, the South Indian dishes that were prepared (and were the ones to be changed) were excellent. Other continental dishes were average. Similar thing was with their Chinese restaurant as well. One night, we ate at their Chinese restaurant as well. The taste of the food was very Indian Chinese and not authentic Chinese food. Another point of mild disappointment was their Travel Desk. The lady at the Travel Desk would spend most of her time chatting with her friends over phone, even while she's sharing information with a tourist! I would have given a rating of 5 to the hotel, but purely because of their inefficient buffet planning, I would rank the hotel as 4.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHandy for MAll of the Emirates - that's about it!\u201d", "Author": "rovingrover_11", "ReviewID": "UR126230001", "Content": "This hotel was mediocre in all ways.

Room was clean and tidy but they have cut back on the little things like the tea and coffee making within the room. We asked for some extra at the desk but were told we must contact housekeeping. We contacted housekeeping and asked for some milk rather than the creamer supplied. This was a chargeable item and on arrival we were given a litre cartoon of milk. We explained that we only required enough milk to make a cup of tea but the housemaid spoke very little English so we spoke with the on duty manager. He stated that if he gave us a small jug of milk then he would have to throw the rest away as opened milk could not be placed back into the fridges. So we accepted the litre of milk. Breakfast was also disappointing. We asked for tea and coffee but the waiter stated that he didn't serve tea and coffee and would inform the relevant person. I like many other guest went to the tea and coffee station and helped ourselves as there did not seem enough staff to cope with the breakfast period. The breakfast was average. We had read about the reports about the smoking and yes they are true. Went for a drink in the bar on the Saturday evening and it was wall to wall smoke.The hotel is located near the Mall of the Emirates but the area is still in the development stage so there are unmade areas to deal with if you are walking.

I suppose that the location near the Mall of the Emirates is a plus, but it's on the far side of the Mall from Sheikh Zayed Road and the metro, so accessibility is not great. The breakfast buffet was, well, pathetic. The main restaurant was full, so we were shunted into the Chinese restaurant. The food was barely passable and service was atrocious--we had to wait 10 minutes for our coffee and had to struggle to get the attention of the staff.

Whilst the pavement on the main road is not made up in places, it is just as easy to walk on the parallel road behind the hotel. Here you will find a couple of supermarkets, some local eateries and a pharmacy. The Dubai Metro has a station within the Mall. An all day ticket is just AED16 allowing unlimited travel on the system. The metro is new, vey clean and highly efficient. Taxis in Dubai are relatively cheap. Hotel transport we had pre arranged to collect us from the airport was about three times the cost of a taxi! The hotel itself is very much as you might expect for a city centre business / tourist hotel. The rooms were clean and comfortable albeit they do seem to vary in size quite considerably. Reception staff were always very helpfull. The Ramada Chelsea has several restaurants and a sports bar. Food quality was good but cost wise seemed a little expensive.

I rang up and told them about the poor service from the night before, luckily they got around to replacing this time however took over 15-20 mins which is not great. Breakfast was manic, it was a free for all with no control what-so-ever. One of the head waiters or breakfast manager put in a bread into the toaster after i had put 3 slices in, the first toast that popped out he grabbed which was mine, after kicking up a fuss he returned it back to me?! Excuse how rude can you possibly get. I wish i could write names of the staff on here, but im not one to name and shame. This hotel has major teething issues and at the end of day i hate to bring it up, but its because of the amount of foreign (mainly Indian) staff they employ. Im Indian myself and i know about the lack of urgency Indian workers have when told to do something. A chain like Ramada really needs to sort this out. Overall its a nice hotel, but i would flatly refuse to stay here again.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPoor Service\u201d", "Author": "LeeKent", "ReviewID": "UR95042013", "Content": "The hotel is in the middle of a building area and not as close to the mall as it makes out, a good 10 minute walk.

While there were some problems along the way, the hotel's good responsive management helped solve them. We arrived on a 6:30 a.m. flight, so we had arranged for an early arrival, for two connecting rooms with an extra bed. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at the hotel around 9:00 a.m., but no problem--normal check-in wasn't until 14:00, so we didn't mind waiting. However, when we did get our rooms, they were not connecting, and there was no extra bed. The extra bed wasn't delivered until well after the children's bedtime, and there wasn't enough room for it. Also, our room keys didn't work, and I had to return to the front desk some seven times in the first 24 hours because we couldn't get into our room. Luckily, when I brought all the room problems to the attention of the hotel's management, we were quickly moved into the connecting rooms with an extra bed that we had requested. No room problems after that. The room included breakfast, which we enjoyed every day. When we told the cooks that our kids didn't eat raisin pancakes, they happily cooked plain pancakes to order for them. Nice service in the breakfast restaurant. There's a small rooftop pool and jacuzzi, very pleasant. The fitness center is small, but adequate. The locker rooms have saunas and steam rooms (men-only and women-only). The health club staff issue towels to visitors, which is very convenient. I generally shaved and showered in the health club because the shower head in the room was mounted way too low. You can rinse yourself if you're about 165 cm or shorter; if you're tall, you wind up squatting in the tub and using the hand-held shower. There were four restaurants in the hotel, plus a \"sports bar\". I put the term in quotes because it had TVs showing sports, but on the nights I visited, there was loud dance/disco music blasting, the kind of music suitable for overdressed 21-year-olds. Not exactly conducive to watching sports, conversing, or relaxing. We used the breakfast restaurant every day, but didn't visit the ritzy Lebanese, Chinese, or Indian restaurants. We found a delightful local Lebanese/Chinese/Indian restaurant on the street behind the hotel called the Five Crowns, where we usually ate far too much great food, and paid on the average around 15-25 AED per person. Location was good, convenient to Wild Wadi, Ski Dubai, Mall of the Emirates, and other attractions in New Dubai and Jumeirah. Internet was not included, unfortunately, and we had to pay 112 AED/week for Internet access. It was also for one device only. We set up our notebook computer, then found out we'd have to pay AGAIN for a full subscription for iPhone access. We were happy to find bottled water in our room, \"compliments of the hotel.\" However, it turned out to be complimentary for the first day only. Luckily, there are a couple small markets near the hotel, so we didn't wind up paying minibar prices. All in all, a pleasant enough stay. The hotel's management was attentive and responsive enough that I'll recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bergen,Norway", "Title": "\u201cNot bad at all\u201d", "Author": "Trine1977", "ReviewID": "UR90319470", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights in Oct.

From the time we arrived untill our departure,all we can say is WOW for what the Hotel had to offer. This is a spanking new property and the room rate is very competetive considering it is a 4 star Hotel. All the staff , from the Front Desk, to the F&B and to the boy who cleaned our room, each and every one had a smile on their face and were very courteous and professional. I/we have stayed in many properties(4 &5 star) wordlwide, and you can tell when you are in safe and good hands. As requested, we were given a non smoking room. Our room was cozy and comfortable and had all amenities that you would come to expect. Internet was charged @ Dirhams 55 for 24 hour package, which is very resonable. The Hotel has 5 restaurants, including a Sports Bar wih the highlight being our dinner at the Indian restaurant. Mind you the Chinese restaurant is another mouth watering experience. We paid for our breakfast which had a variety of dishes, the Chef even checked with my wife if her eggs were done as per her request, small touches which go a long way. The Health Club has a lovely steam & sauna room(seperate for men and women) and my wife also enjoyed a wonderful and relaxing massage. They have a open air swimming pool and a gym as well, but we gave it a miss. All in all, we had an wonderful trip to Dubai and our Hotel stay was the highlight.

Bathroom included bath with powerful shower and plenty of hot/cold water, free complimentary newspaper. Gym and swimming pool also included steam and sauna - all were very good. Hotel staff excellent - top class customer service as expected. Must try the International Buffet in the Seasons restaurant. All types of international food, curries, (I had the best lamb curry ever), starters, main dishes and sweets all for 59 dirhams (\u00a310.00 approx) - a bargain! Meal Five star plus quality. 6 dirhams to use the new Metro system (\u00a31.00 approx) transfer from the airport to the Mall of the Emirates (MOE) and I walked the rest of the way, approx 20 mins, to the Hotel. What a bargain! However, during the heat of the day a taxi from MOE to the Hotel is recommended, it costs no more than 7 dirhams, the minimum fare is 10.00 The transfer from the Hotel to the airport cost 50 dirhams. It does pay to use the Metro if you are watching your money! Negatives - Its a good 15 minute walk from the Hotel to MOE, their road system is not designed for walking and construction along the route made it interesting. Taxi drivers don't like short trips either so be prepared - don't tolerate any negative 'vibes' from them and be assertive if they are not happy. I used the MOE Metro station as my gateway to other parts of Dubai. I believe the Metro system and economic climate has taken away some of their business. I really did notice a difference on this visit. Top tips - If your on a budget, be smart, use the metro where possible its cheap clean and safe, compared to the driving antics of some taxi drivers! Overall, a hotel definitely worth a visit if travelling alone or as a couple for business or pleasure.
