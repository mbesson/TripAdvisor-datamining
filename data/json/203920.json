The rooms are very nice, the rates were reasonable, the location is great (although it was about an 8 euro taxi ride to the train station). Free internet in the lobby, a decent breakfast area, and an amazingly friendly staff. We had a triple, which was nice because it was like a 2-bedroom apartment with a little kitchenette.

We booked Hotel Dante through Venere.com. What a find! It is located in a safe, quiet alley right behind the beautiful church of Santa Croce (where Galileo, Machiavelli, Rossini and other notables were buried). At night the little square in front of the church is filled with locals as well as tourists just hanging out, enjoying the cool air. The hotel is an easy stroll (approx. 10 mins.) to the Piazza della Signoria, Ponte Vecchio, the Duomo, etc., down narrow streets lined with shops. There's a tiny supermarket just down the street from the hotel, and the post office and a Standa supermarket are about 10-15 minutes away.The four of us were given two adjoining double rooms on the 3rd floor sharing a hallway behind a lockable door. One of the rooms even has a kitchenette and laundry area. The rooms are bright and airy. Furnishings are modest but new--quite homelike in feel. Housekeeping is immaculate.Unusual for hotels of this kind, located in old buildings, Hotel Dante has an elevator!The included breakfast is substantial--you can have your fill of rolls and croissants, cereal and milk and yogurt. You eat in a tiny courtyard under market umbrellas. The owners are friendly and helpful. There's free internet access on a computer set aside for guests. All this for very, very reasonable rates. We'll definitely stay here again on our next visit to Florence.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR783917234", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "saulwong"}, {"Content": "Great hotel - far from railway and busstation Located close to S.

The room my husband and I slept in was only large enough to fit a sofa bed type of mattress, our suitcases didn't fit in the room and our feet were higher than our heads! We allowed our kids to sleep in the nice room with two twin beds, nice, big closets. The kid's room was really pretty nice! The bathroom looked like it had recently been redone, it was nice, but you couldn't turn around in it. You stepped out of the shower and you were sitting on the toilet. The management was VERY nice though. The night management man didn't speak one work of English, so that was a bit of a problem. The cup of espresso they made fresh for me the first morning I was there was THE best cup of coffee I've ever had in my life. Breakfast was rolls with jam and butter, croissants that weren't very good and one type of cereal, fruit juice. Pretty basic.

The rooms were terrible. It felt like being couped up in a cell with really bad 70's furniture. Plus you had to leave your passport and your room key with weird staff every time you went out. When we booked our room it didn't tell us we had a kitchenette. Usually a kitchenette would be a plus, but here it is a nasty surprise. We really felt like prisoners whenever we were in the room.

It was unquestionably my worst hotel experience in Italy. It is in a good location right at Santa Croce, and as a bonus there is a cab stand at the Santa Croce Piazza so you don't have to have a cab called for you (you pay for the cab from the moment it is dispatched). It's right around the corner from Vivoli, one of the best gelaterias in Florence. The staff is friendly. Now for the downside: when I opened my room door I was assailed by an overwhelming smell of perfume that was obviously used to cover up the overwhelming smell of smoke. I started choking pretty much from the moment I entered the room. Within half an hour my nose was running and I was sneezing. I asked the man at the desk if there were any non-smoking rooms available, and he acted like he had no idea what I was talking about, which would be understandable...had I not been asking him in Italian! The window opened onto a courtyard, so there was no air circulation to try to get some of the unbearable odors out, but I slept with it open anyway (despite the noise) because the thought of shutting myself into that room with all those allergens made me feel like I was going to suffocate. The bathroom was even worse with perfume and I had to keep the door to it closed at all times. By the end of a shower I was miserable from being closed up in there with steam enhancing the potency of the perfume. The only way I could sleep in there was by taking Benadryl, and during the day taking Actifed (E6.00 at the Farmacia) to try to clear out the allergies. As I was checking out I noticed an air freshener was plugged in, I wish I had seen it before as unplugging it might have given me some relief from the heavy, unbearable perfume. The breakfast was strictly continental, though there was plenty of fruit. For a smoky suffocating room, Hotel Pagnini was cuter, cheaper, and somewhat less smoky with no perfume. If they have non-smoking rooms (doubtful), this would be a good hotel. If you are at all sensitive to smoke or perfume (and I am not even that sensitive to perfume! It was just so heavy!!!), stay far away from this hotel.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR993919996", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Perfect Hotel Perfect Hotel.
