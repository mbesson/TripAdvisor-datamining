Room decor is tired however I felt safe, had a good night's sleep, and was able to walk everywhere. Hotel improvements have been made. Buffet breakfast had a large assortment of food & even the local police eat here. Staff speak little English but with gestures was able to cope. It's like a backpackers. The shower was very small but water was hot and the toilet flushed. It was one block from the Four Seasons Hotel but the price is certainly a lot cheaper.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "maydaymusic", "ReviewID": "UR28262547", "Content": "The only complain I could say is....the bath room is small & shower water couldn't run smoothly.

It is rated as OK in Lonely planet so it quickly pushes up the prices. I have noticed this trend in many countries. Fortunately trip advisor does not suffer from this as you can get immediate feedback on any gouging from this site. We were looking for the hotel and were tackled by a man who spoke very good English. It transpired he worked for the Ishakpasha Hotel so we went with him. He tried to sell us a taxi to the local palace saying the Dolmus was not working (a lie). We were quoted 50 YTL for a double without breakfast but agreed on 45 YTL including breakfast (o aircon but not needed). The downstairs is gloomy and rough - the room was small, dirty and balcony entrance was blocked but - we were tired so we agreed to stay. About 10 Oclock the roof started dripping water on our heads (it had just started pouring down with rain) however (as my wife pointed out) there was one floor above us between us and any leaky roof. Workmen had caused the leak so we were moved to another (slightly nicer ) room. In the night someone tried to break into our room !! Lots of banging and noise from the workmen. Everything was dirty and crumbly. In the morning we went down for breakfast. Sat at a small table and no one came. We enquired - had to wait for someone. Eventually a bit of cheese on the same plate as some honey (mixed) - no tomato, olives or cucumber. Bread. One cup of tea. After complaint salad came after we had nearly finished. The staff were not friendly. I would never stay there again in a million years.

The pictures looked okay so I rang the hotel directly and booked. Unfortunately we were not at all happy when we got there. What you can't see from the pics is that the hotel is on an incredibly steep hill with hardly any footpath and to add its a very narrow street and is always busy as there is a taxi stop 20 yards up! The decor in the hotel is very outdated and old, the room was very weirdly decorated and a bit dingy. We tried to open the window but the handle came off. None of the windows closed properly either which made for a noisy night. The hotel also has no lift. Breakfast was also very minimal. We only ended up staying 2 nights out of 7 as we went and booked a different hotel which was far superior yet cheaper. I didnt actually have a shower for two days during my stay at Ishak Pasa, the staff were very helpful but a bit clueless as they beleive a queen size bed to be the same size as a double. The only good thing about the hotel is the location, it is a 2min walk from the main attractions.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cthey could have at least cleaned the place\u201d", "Author": "anonymous20", "ReviewID": "UR4024456", "Content": "It looks cute from the outside but this place is run down and dirty. Even if you judge it from a \"backpacker hotel\" standard it is pretty bad, especially since it's not all that cheap. Dust in the corners, ancient toothpaste rings on the bathroom's glass shelf, exposed piping and mildew in the shower. For just a little bit more (about 15 euro) you can stay up the street at the Hotel Uyan which has updated bathrooms and is very clean. Also try the Side Hotel which is also close by, it is cheaper and cleaner than the Ishakpasa Konagi.", "Date": "October 15, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ishak Pasa Konagi", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d306336-Reviews-Ishak_Pasa_Konagi-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$104 - $151*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Ishakpasa Cad.
