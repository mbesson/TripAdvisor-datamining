A friend recommended the Villa Cofresi. The hotel is a family owned and operated establishment. There is certainly a welcoming, friendly atmosphere that is promoted here. We met many families that return year after year that seemed very happy with the hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m trying my best to be optimistic about this place and we usually overlook minor details that disappoint us, but in this instance, there are just too many to ignore. The positive: First and foremost the staff is very friendly and accommodating (genuinely nice people). The rates are quite reasonable. The bar is one of the nicest in Rincon (right on the beach / amazing sunsets). Monday night (Gringo night is a lot of fun, great band) Pirate special (Rum / Kahlua drink served in a fresh coconut\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6how often do you see a bartender swinging a machete behind a bar?). Spacious rooms with large balconies. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an electronic safe in the room. Housekeeping is quite thorough and does a nice job. Nice large umbrellas are available for loan to take with you when you visit another beach (nice touch). The negative: During the course of our weeklong stay, we had one hot shower. (No hot water on any evening of our stay) The air conditioner made a LOT of noise (screeching sound, we requested that it be repaired; they attempted to fix it but were unsuccessful). Outside noise makes it difficult to get a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Friday through Monday, if you go out for dinner, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a parking spot when you return. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights the bar fills with locals (not guests of the hotel). There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much beach and there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough lounge chairs. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no break at this hotel, you have to drive about ten minutes away to find surf. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shortage of beach towels. Intermittent wifi (it rarely worked in the room but in the lobby it always worked). The free breakfast is adequate, but could be better. (They offer one type of fruit per day, no yogurt and no granola. If you want eggs they charge you $6. They only use paper and plastic. The paper coffee cups are a little bit bigger than a shot glass.) No gym. Bottom line: We enjoyed our stay and the people there are really nice, but we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return to this property.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cMy every year selection\u201d", "Author": "Sharili", "ReviewID": "UR124809992", "Content": "I stay there almost every year, they bring good service.

To put it simply, we LOVED this hotel. The room we stayed in was a deluxe ocean view king and I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. The room was very large and very clean, with a big balcony over-looking the ocean. One of the things that struck me was that there was no musty smell that you often find in hotel rooms when you travel to the Caribbean. Housekeeping was great and any requests from the front desk ( i.e. extra pillows) were handled promptly and courteously. We didn't have the problem with noise from the bar that some of the reviewers mention but that was becuase we were in the section of the hotel that is farthest away from the bar- it is definitely worth the $$ to book one of these rooms if you can. Speaking of the bar- what a blast! The bartenders are really fun and friendly and the service was great. You must try the pirata special that everyone talks about- yummy and STRONG. We ate lunch every day at the hotel bar and the food was delicious. The more formal restaurant at the hotel is ok but there are so many funky, beachy places to eat in Rincon that we went off property every night for dinner. The service at the hotel was top notch and we felt very welcomed and \"at-home\" from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. As many reviewers have stated, this isn't the Ritz or the Four Seasons.

Tables and furniture that needed a thorough cleaning, the smell of stale food and spilled drinks in the bar, tiles with too much built up dirt. The public areas did not feel clean enough ( the rooms however were spotless). Not a disaster though, just distracting.

I had one small issue with my room (window handle not working) and it was attended to and fixed immediately!

It was a very cool, authentic scene of locals and tourists. Very good food too! All this,overlooking the sea. The hotel beach is great; it has sand, is not crowded at all, is good for swimming and faces west for beautiful sunsets. There are shops, restaurants and other beaches within short walking distance. I don't drive but I have to say that Rincon is a town that definitely drives and I think it's best to have a car if you're spending more than two days there. If you tend to go to bed early and want quiet nights be sure to ask for a quiet room in advance. The bar party scene lasts till about midnight but there are rooms that don't face the bar.

We absolutely loved this hotel. It was recommended to us by one of my students who is from Puerto Rico. This is a family-owned hotel that Puerto Ricans love going to. It is a great way to immerse yourself in the Puerto Rican culture. The hotel is right on the beach in laid-back Rincon, famous for holding a world surfing championship long ago. Our 6 days at the Villa Cofresi were incredibly relaxing. The hotel has perhaps 80 rooms or so. Most are built around a U-shape, opening to the ocean. Also within the U are the small pool, outdoor seating, and the outdoor bar. This is a great gathering area, with music going all day and salsa dancing/karaoke/live music going on in the evenings. We had asked for a room away from this area and our Deluxe room on the 2nd of 3 floors was facing the ocean on a newer extension (a double U?) of the buiding. However, it also would have been fun to have a room on the inner side, depending on whether you want to listen to the music until 11 or so. As the sun goes down, the lighting on this coutyard is fantastic...incredibly romantic. We ate a number of dinners out in the courtyard. The restaurant, which serves dinners, is fantastic. I think that many of the locals come for the steaks and seafood, but we usually had one of the Puerto Rican dishes. You can get lunch outside through the bar, which grills up great hamburgers and tostones (fried bananas, similar to fries). They make these great Pirate Specials---basically pina colladas served in a coconut. They machete the fresh coconut right there, slashing down towards the coconut with their hand underneath the coconut--don't try this at home. Fantastic! The quick, basic breakfasts are fantastic for families. I read some negative comments about the breakfasts, but you must remember that the breakfasts ARE FREE! Personally, I like eating on paper plates. They have cereals, sweet rolls, bagels and cream cheese, breads that many people used to make breakfast sandwiches with the cheese and ham, usually a frozen waffle or pancake that you can heat up, fruits, fruit juices, delicious coffee. And, did I mention that this was FREE?! We missed the free classes on Yoga and salsa dancing, as well as a magician that was there on Mondays. I would guess that about 90 percent of the people staying there spoke spanish, which for us, made the vacation more cultural and meaningful. We later stayed 4 days at a large resort on the east coast, where 90% of the guests spoke english, and it just was not the same. (The people working at the Villa Cofresi are bilingual.) Above everyting else, the service was fantastic...we felt like family. This included housekeeping, front desk, waiters, bar people...everybody. In fact, the owner's son taught my 10 year old how to boogie board, which was an added bonus. Overall, this is a very, very well run hotel. We do not know when we will be able to travel back to Puerto Rico, but if we do, we will stay at the Villa Cofresi, without a doubt. Puerto Rico is a fantastic place and we absolutely love the people, particularly those that we met at the Villa Cofresi.

It has been a pleasure to watch the Villa expand and improve over the years - there is always something new, whether it is the new pineapple lamps, the tile, renovated rooms and so on. There is always something fresh and exciting. Sadly, this was the last visit staying in our longtime favorite room next to the beach and pool with the view of Little Malibu and Tres Palmas from our porch -- the night time tempo of music and karaoke from the bohio (bar/grill/lounge area) became too much for me since I arise before dawn to go surfing every morning. Even though that will be missed, too. Next year we will be staying in the rooms in the \"new\" section on the south side of the main complex which is much quieter and have wonderful views of the Caribbean (but not the Little Malibu \"indicators\" for surf check!). The rooms in this section are both large and small - we will be staying in one of the spacious rooms and I sampled one of these by myself during an April trip for some surfing before heading to San Juan for a class reunion). There are also quiet rooms in the back (near the parking lot). The Villa has a great restaurant, moderately priced, and bohio where you can order up hamburgers, fries, and pinchos. My recommendation is to select the pinchos - burgers are available everywhere, but pinchos are not! There are also a few restaurants within walking distance and many more options within a 10-minute drive.

It's a family run place and you can really tell the staff takes a lot of pride in their hospitality. The lobby terrace connects right onto the hotel bar and the sea front - they're not kidding when they say it's right on the beach. It's not an ideal surfer spot, the waves are too gentle, but it's a 10 minute drive to where the surfers hang out. Everyone is really friendly and 95% of the staff speaks good English (a few of the maids didn't, but we still communicated fine.) We traveled in a group of extended family ranging in age from 2 years old to 88 years old, and there was something for everyone to enjoy their vacation - a relaxed terrace that transforms into a bustling, fun bar scene at night with live music and friendly locals, the ocean and a pool, and a game room with pinball and video games. What's also nice is that if you just want to have a resort experience, everything you need to be comfortable is at the hotel, but if you don't like being in a tourist bubble it's a safe 20 minute walk to the town center of Rincon. The locals are friendly and it's a chance to experience every day life in Rincon. Also, there's a supermarket and a very good organic market on the way, and if you really want a taste of the exotic on your vacation, right at the hotel gate there's a botanica (a Santeria supply shop with candles and magic charms) and the English-fluent owner is happy to show you around and have you listen to some of his collection of Afro-Cuban world music. If there was one thing I would change it's that policies and check-ins were a little confused because there's not uniform communication between staff (for example, there was some confusion when we checked in because a wrong name was on our reservation) But other than that I am looking forward to the next time we can visit and experience paradise again.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect for our two bedroom apartment. It's the one accommodation that is not pictured on the website. Well... we were thrilled. It was lovely. Very airy, nicely furnished and it had a balcony leading out to a terrace with views of the ocean beyond. It was great! Continentall breakfast was included in the rate. For an extra $5, you could eggs. We stayed for three days and the breakfast foods were varied We ate dinner at the restaurant every evening (or at least from the restaurant - we ate outdoors overlooking the water or else had dinner delivered to our room, which was a nice option given the age of our children). The staff are excellent. They were great with our kids and made us feel very welcome. There is no gym. Instead guests are directed to a public gymnasium about 3/4 of a mile away. The hotel is right on the beach. The water is a little rough for small kids, but we all enjoyed walks on the beach. The pool is small, but again perfect for our kids, and there's a pool for toddlers too. The views and the sunsets are beautiful. It was nice hanging on the terrace watching the sun go down while the kids ran around. The bar staff are very nice, and the hotel offers a delicious rum drink served directly from a coconut. The bar opens at 10AM, and that's when the music starts too. Other reviewers commented on the music being too loud. We didn't have a problem sleeping through the din, and our kids were fine too. I'm not sure what time the bar closes. I'm usually out for the count by 9pm anyway. We stayed Sunday thru' Wednesday, and the hotel was not full.

Wonder bread, and pre-wrapped american cheese slices, ham, fruit of the day (either apples, plums, kiwi) and some 'danish' (also, in some cases pre-wrapped).

In the end, we were not disappointed, although we did find it to be a bit rough around the edges (dirty carpets, old furniture) and quite loud at times (even though we were in PR during a relatively low season). The noise stems from the fact the this hotel has a bar right in the center of its main courtyard area, and noise rise up to all rooms from there. The bar is nicely located for guests, but also seems to be the main bar on the beach, and thus most of the clientele are not staying at the hotel and it is active all day long (sunsets are great from here, so no surprise there). I awoke one Sunday morning at 9 am to the sounds of Michael Jackson. The next day, a Monday, we were awaken at 7:30 am, when the maintenance staff decided to begin work on replacing some tile (ie, construction work). I prefer to sleep a little later when I am on vacation and after having listened to the jukebox until 1 am the night before. On the plus side, there are some suitable restaurants within walking distance (try Rincon Tropical for seafood, and Cerdito del Cielito for some very good BBQ). The bar makes excellent mojitos and charges on $3 for a cold beer). The bar is right next to the small beach, which is protected enough to be excellent for swimming. There is also a small but very clean swimming pool. Also, the Cofresi largely caters to a Puerto Rican guest base and we found this to be a plus. The breakfast is one of the less inviting I have had but at least there is something available. For the price - we paid $155 for a room with ocean view and balcony on the third floor - this is a decent enough place. We would certainly stay here again, but would not look forward to the heavy traffic congestion that you will encounter as you return to San Juan (the worst traffic we experienced during our trip around the island).", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely Returning\u201d", "Author": "PR3ofus", "ReviewID": "UR22388722", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights in Sept '08 with our daughter, celebrating her 15th bday, our cousin, celebrating his 21st bday.

It's right on the beach, the rooms are beautiful and well maintained, and the staff are super friendly and helpful. Villa Cofresi is managed by a lovely lady called Sandra Caro, and her husband Tito. It's big enough to offer the facilities you'd expect from a larger, more expensive establishment, but not so big that it loses the personal touch. I stayed at Villa Cofresi with my girlfriend over Christmas 2007 and the New Year. We had looked at a number of hotels including \"Rincon of the Seas\" next door (overpriced and lacking atmosphere) and smaller guest houses (too basic and in some cases, not very clean) and, because we arrived very late and hadn't made any plans, stayed our first night in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lazy Parrot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (quaint, but cramped, and miles from the beach). When we arrived at the hotel we were immediately made to feel very welcome by Sandra and her staff. Could we borrow an iron? No problem - we were given one to keep for the whole fortnight. Do you have any parasols for the beach? Two appeared the following day, and again these were ours to use throughout our stay. When we wanted to hire jet-skis they negotiated a discount for us. Nothing was too much trouble - we were made to feel completely at home from the moment we arrived till the morning we sadly had to wave goodbye. The one event which really stands out above all others as an example of this hotel's fantastic attitude towards its guests is the way Sandra and Tito helped us with a shopping trip to Mayaguez.* We asked at reception for someone to call us a taxi to take us to the big shopping mall in Mayaguez, about 40 minutes' drive away. They tried a few numbers but no one was available for a few hours, which would have been too late. We were debating whether we should book someone to take us the following morning when Sandra appeared and asked us if she could help. She immediately told us that Tito had to go into Mayaguez anyway and would gladly take us with him. He did so, and would have waited for us to shop but we knew we were going to be a few hours and said we would find a taxi to bring us back. Well, we did a lot of good shopping, but the next day I realised that because of a mix-up I had left my bank card in one of the shops. Once again Sandra was brilliant. First she called around the shops to find my card and then said that she would pick it up for me in the evening as she had to go there to buy a few things for the hotel's New Year celebrations. She delivered it back to me personally at 10.30 that night. How many hotel managers do you know who would go the extra mile like this? We were told that Villa Cofresi has been owned by Sandra's family for a number of years, possibly ever since it was founded. This is what makes all the difference. As owner managers, rather than mere members of staff working for some anonymous proprietor, Sandra and Tito instinctively understand that the success of their business depends on total customer satisfaction, and that's exactly what they give. The hotel has a genuine family atmosphere, with everyone working together to provide their guests with everything they need to enjoy their stay. As well as being ideal for couples like us - you can always find a quiet corner! - Villa Cofresi is also perfect for guests with children, because the beach bar (the only one along this stretch of coast, as far as we could see) allows parents who want to enjoy a drink or meal to keep an eye on their children swimming a few yards away. In conclusion, I cannot recommend Villa Cofresi highly enough - just go there and you will see for yourselves. This is a special place run by special people. * I should explain that we made the mistake of not hiring a car for our stay in Puerto Rico. We have travelled all around the Caribbean, and everywhere else the easiest way to get around is to hail a taxi or, more often, one of the locals who ferry people around to earn some extra cash. In Puerto Rico generally there aren't many taxis, in Rincon hardly any at all, so if you're planning to do any sightseeing you really do need to hire.

Some of the reviews I have read here complained of the noise from the bar. It did get a bit active, mostly with young locals. That could be valid if you get a room looking out on the bar. We were in a section of the hotel off to the side with a wing of the hotel blocking us from the bar so we didn't hear anything but the sound of the waves on the beach. The included breakfast was typical of the buffet style, cereal, some sort of muffins or pastry, the usual beverages, french toast, fruit or for additional fee, you could have whatever you wanted cooked. The bar menu was varied and quite good. There is a restraunt on the premises but we never got around to visiting it. Many other restraunts are close by. The menu offerings looked good tho. The service all around was excellent, from check-in to check out. Houskeeping, bar staff and the rest of the staff were always eager to assist with any request we had.

I'm not sure why you need a pool 20 yards from a beautiful beach and a calm, warm Carribean sea but we happend to visit right when the hotel was having the pool refurbished.
