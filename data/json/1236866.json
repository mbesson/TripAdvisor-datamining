In fact, we have 110 of them! If you're traveling with your family, you may opt for a room with two beds. Or, if you're here by yourself on business, why not book a room with a plush, king-sized bed so you can stretch out and relax?\" Pros: - Very clean, spacious, comfortable, and quiet hotel room. - Staff very helpful and friendly. Housekeeping does an exceptional job at keeping the lobby, breakfast area, corridors, pool area, fitness center, business center, and hotel room clean. - Very clean pool and hot tub. - High ceiling and shower head in hotel room bathroom. - Complimentary hot breakfast with many options. Breakfast area is well kept, even with a lot of guests. - Located close to I-465. - Complimentary guest washer and dryer (an unheard of pleasant surprise to me even though I did not use the laundry facility -- located by ice and soda machines). Cons: - Hotel room\u2019s thick end cap decor curtains are fixed towards the right and left sides of window so could not move to keep out most of the outdoor light from the well lit parking lot and early morning sunrise. Please note hotel room also has a white curtain that is closer to the window which did cover the whole window for privacy but was sheer so some light still came into the room with all the hotel room lights off. - For all of the amenities this hotel has to offer I would of liked a mini refrigerator in my room. From http://hamptoninn.hilton.com room pictures it looks like the hotel suites have refrigerators, but not regular guest rooms.

We truly cannot say enough good things about our experience. The staff was very accommodating and courteous; rooms were immaculate. We found out how truly wonderful the staff was when we returned home to realize our 4 yr old son's \"lovey\" did not make it home. This blanket had traveled with him from Guatemala as a baby & has rarely left his clutches. I immediately called the hotel Sunday evening (7/24) asking if my son's blanket was placed in the lost and found, the attendant checked and returned with a \"no\" but assured me that they would continue to look. I then explained how important this blanket was and why, the Attendant was very kind and again told me they check everything and everywhere. Monday afternoon, after running an errand, I returned home to find a message on our answering machine from an Attendant with the Hampton letting me know the lovey had been found & wanted to verify my address. I immediately called and by tonight (7/27) my son's lovey was back in his cute little clutches. The staff, from the front desk, to housekeeping went above and beyond for my little boy. We are so appreciative and our son is sleeping Peacefully. Our only complaints, if they would actually qualify as that, were; the water in the pool was too cold for my oldest son to enjoy. The rooms were small & the crib, which turned out to be a pack n' play was a bit flimsy. With that being said, these issues would not keep us from recommending, or staying there again.

This was the best hotel we stayed at by far! It was clean. The staff was extremely friendly (greeted us and checked in on us when we walked by). The room was very clean. The TV was huge and very nice. One thing that should not have made me as excited as it did was the fact that they had shampoo and conditioner (two separate bottles). They even had a cute little lap desk for us. The beds were comfortable. The only bad thing I can think of, which is being nitpicky, is that, unlike advertised, you don't have a choice between soft and firm pillows but rather soft and so-soft-there's-nothing-in-here pillows. That being said, although I am a fan of firm pillows, the bed was so comfortable that I was able to still get a good night's sleep. The thing that really sold me on the hotel was the breakfast. I've said it in several reviews now, and I'll say it again - what really matters to me when booking a hotel is the breakfast. It was the best, most delicious hotel breakfast I have ever had the joy of feasting on. They offered sausage, tater tots, scrambled eggs, waffles, bagels and peanut butter, muffins, cereal, oatmeal, assorted fruits, along with more juice options than usual - cranberry (!), apple and orange juice.

Kelly, the general manager, was extremely helpful and friendly from the moment we walked into the hotel to check in until the last day of our stay, and Cindy, the lady in charge of the kitchen/breakfast area, was also very pleasant and accommodating during our entire stay. Both ladies regularly offered suggestions on which attractions to visit during our stay and Kelly even pulled out a map and showed us the ins & outs of how to get to our areas of interest downtown and exactly where to park. The staff seemed genuinely interested in how we were enjoying our vacation in Indy as well as how we were enjoying our stay at their hotel. And the location of this hotel is perfect - it's located in a quiet, clean area with several nice corporate office buildings nearby as well as restaurants and freeway access very close - it's only about a 10 minute drive from the hotel to Indy's beautiful downtown area. A really nice touch offered by this hotel is \"breakfast bags\" containing water, fruit, muffin, and cereal bar for guests to take with them when they leave the hotel in the mornings. They also have nice complimentary informal dinner receptions for guests. We'll definitely be back to Indianapolis and won't stay anywhere except this hotel! NOTE: A previous review posted by EBMDD is extremely inaccurate and misrepresents this hotel - that review states this hotel is located in an industrial area with nothing open nearby after dark. This hotel is ABSOLUTELY NOT located in an industrial area and there are plenty of locations from which to grab a quality bite to eat that are well within close proximity to the hotel (Bob Evans restaurant is just one example)! When I read that review before our trip to Indy, I feared that this hotel was surrounded by factories with polluted smoke billowing from huge smokestacks, etc. This is not at all an accurate description of the area surrounding this hotel. Rather, as I stated in my review above, this hotel is located in a very nice corporate business park type of area with many nice corporate office buildings as well as restaurants & freeway access nearby.
