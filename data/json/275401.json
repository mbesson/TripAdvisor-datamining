The hotel is located outside the city centre and the only local shop nearby was the Total garage next door! It is a little isolated, in the middle of a business park. It is reasonably close to the Amsterdam Arena and about a 10 minute walk to the nearest Metro station. A taxi ride into the city centre - to the Central Station in fact, cost 23 Euros! The hotel itself is fairly modern and well presented. Like most Dutch hotels, it has an indoor smoking room, which is hard to comprehend coming from the UK. The greeting at reception was courteuous, professional and, luckily for me, in very good English! My room was on the 2nd floor, although to us, that is actually the 1st floor! I think they counted the basement as the ground floor!? The access to the upper floors is either via stairs or a lift, which is accessed by your keycard. Access to your individual row of rooms is also by keycard. I had a deluxe single room, which consisted of 2 single beds, a small seating area, with 2 comfortable armchairs and a small table and a desk. The bathroom was clean a tidy and the shower was excellent, with good power. The only negative about the room was the state of the carpet, as something had been spilled on it and the stain not cleaned up!!?? The room was nice and quiet although I was disturbed during the night by the doors to other rooms closing, as these were on hydraulic hinges/auto close hinges, so couldn't really be closed quietly. The breakfast was pretty good and you had the option of cereals, breads, meats, cheeses, fruits, yoghurts, pastries, scrambled, fried or boiled eggs and bacon. All of which was nice and warm (where it was supposed to be warm!!) and fresh. I had one evening meal in the hotel, too, which was good. I have had better, but it was hot and tasty and you got a lot for your Euro! I had chicken tandoori and while I was waiting for it, I had some breads with garlic butter, followed by some salad and when the meal came, there was more salad and chips AND wedges! Nice.

It was an acceptable hotel, for our 3 day stay, we got there by car and you can park your car for free there - parking your car in the city costs you a little fortune too (I think last time we paid 30 Euros a day), so this was another reason not to stay right in town. The walk and ride with the train downtown was ok, of course it would have been nicer to be closer, but we didn't want to spend that much money. Room was clean, ate once in the hotel (was expensive but very good).

As the writer of the other review states, its a good 10 minute walk from the metro station. Of course, this wouldn't be so bad, if you don't have a lot of luggage - otherwise, its a bit of a tedious walk. And contrary to what the hotel says, it is not overly close to all the major tourist attractions; you will most certainly have to make a connection or two on the trains or trams in order to arrive in any part of Amsterdam's major tourist destinations. We were a bit disheartened to learn that the other Bastion Deluxe Hotels throughout Amsterdam offer free shuttle service to and from their hotel; however, this one does not. As for the hotel itself, we were relatively pleased with our room and the appearance. The room we had came with two twin beds, a large bathroom, safe and a mini-bar (which was very reasonable in prices). We highly recommend paying for the breakfast they provide (EUR 11, per person) as it is delicious and well worth it. If you're in the mood for anything else other than breakfast, you'll find the closest thing you're going to get beyond the hotel restaurant is the gas station situated only feet from the hotel - which hardly constitutes a meal. We did not find the staff to be overly friendly, as most everyone tends to be in Amsterdam. They were certainly very attentive and promptly took to our request for a taxi and internet service but they did not give the \"going the extra mile\" impression. All in all, we as well as the previous writer, do not recommend this hotel for the tourist. It's a great hotel for the business traveler or the person who enjoys walking and/or public transportation rides. And not to mention, going out at night may take you a bit longer to get back to the hotel since the trains and trams don't run as frequently as they do during the day. Certainly a very clean, comfortable hotel but in a poor location.", "Date": "February 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Location!\u201d", "Author": "cher_ios", "ReviewID": "UR2129899", "Content": "If you're thinking about staying here while you tour Amsterdam, I'd consider thinking again, particularly if you don't have a car! The hotel is a good 15 minute walk to the metro station, down a road that does not have a sidewalk for part of the way. Nor does the road have a proper crosswalk for pedestrians, so prepare to engage in a run of terror across the street with your suitcase. The hotel says that it's just a 'hop skip and a jump' from the main tourist area, but that's just not the case. There's nothing around the hotel but a gas station, and the hotel restaurant is quite expensive, for poor quality. From my side of the hotel I had a lovely view of the metro tracks, which were very loud and ran all night. From the other side of the hotel you can look at the 3 jails which are just down the street from the hotel. Aside from the location, the hotel is alright. The showers suck, and flood the bathroom, but I think that's a European thing, rather than specific to this hotel. I had to ask for fresh towels, they put the ones I left on the bathroom floor on the radiator to dry. Overall, a good hotel for business people in the city on business and with cars, but not for the average tourist.", "Date": "May 29, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bastion Deluxe Amsterdam / Amstel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d275401-Reviews-Bastion_Deluxe_Amsterdam_Amstel-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$127 - $197*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Verlengde Van Marwijk Kooystraat 30</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1096 BX</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "275401", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8a/94/8a94479e9c912f99c9b1122a9bd4f3b95large.jpg"}}
