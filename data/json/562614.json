We checked in and no mention was made of the fact that the lift was broken...on checking the internet, it turns out it's been broken for over 1 year. We had to drag out luggage up 3 floors. No offer of assistance was forthcoming. My room was tiny....you had to turn side on to get into the bathroom - the space between the bed and bathroom door was maybe 10 inches.. You also had to sit side-on on the toilet, as there was maybe 3 inches between the seat and the heater. The room was claustrophobic. Access to the free wifi was spasmodic, and mostly inaccessible. I spoke to the afternoon staff and they reset it, and access was possible for 1 hour before it crashed again. I spoke to the morning reception staff (Alicia) this morning, and she rudely told me that she had no idea if it was fixed and that couldn't (read: wouldn't) check if it was working. I asked her if I could use the communal computer, and when I did, I again couldn't access the internet. When I raised it with the receptionist, she rudely told me that she couldn't help me (again read: wouldn't). I asked her if it was possible that I needed to turn something else on, on the computer in order to access the net, and she turned and walked away from me. I was furious. I reminded her that I was a house guest, that was paying for the \"pleasure\" of staying in the hotel, and in fact paying her wages....her reply \"What?\" and I repeated myself and said that being abusive was unacceptable,.....and she just walked away. I left the hotel, found another one, and when I came back, she was yelling at another house guest, who responded in kind. She's the wrong person for a hospitality job.... The hotel is basically an overpriced dump.....there are far better places just around the corner....with polite staff, breakfast, working wifi, and lifts.....use them...(Hotel Jardin de Villiers)", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "denver, Colorado, USA", "Title": "\u201cA Russian orphanage in Siberia is cleaner and better to stay at, trust me, I\u2019ve done it.\u201d", "Author": "denvertraveler06", "ReviewID": "UR122997540", "Content": "I\u2019m gonna start with the positives: 1.

The bathroom heater wasn\u2019t working, the heater in the room was barely working, how could it work, it looked like it\u2019s been abused. It was dirty and rusty. The bed uncomfortable and the top blanket clearly not washed ever. My pillow was more like a bag of clumpy rice, than a pillow. After two days in the first room given to us, I asked the front desk to fix the heater in the bathroom. They gave us another room, which was nice. So room number two had a terrible dirty carpet, it\u2019s not been washed ever, let alone vacuumed. The bathroom there was better, but the situation with the pillows and the blanket on the bed the same. They didn\u2019t change the sheets every day and one day ran out of towels to give us. Yep, no clean towels. In both rooms, the walls and pretty much everything was visibly dirty. I didn\u2019t look for it, promise, it was just in my face. I am not a clean freak, but I asked my husband to walk around with socks on trying not to pick up some gross disease. People clearly stay there, clearly put up with it.

The hotel was not my choice but was booked for me from my agency. The rooms are small but normal for Paris.

The staff shows the typical Parisian controversial attitude, sometimes friendly, sometimes neutral and sometimes not caring at all. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels also provided everyday. The walls are made literally out of paper, since i could hear my colleagues talking over the phone two storeys above (not to mention more intimate encounters..). The breakfast is ugly. A generous buffet full of ready-made junk food. During the three weeks i stayed here, there were days that the buffet emptied and there was not reserved food for the guests. WiFi is crappy and if you want real internet you have to pay...There is a small fridge so at least i was buying fresh fruits and real juices. The good thing about this hotel is the location. Wagram is a typical Parisian neighborhood with not so many tourists and one of the places to get an original feel of Paris. Around the corner is a lovely market with all kind of things to buy and lots of cafes and restaurants to eat. Next good thing is the metro and bus which is located very close so moving around Paris is effortless. Montmartre is within walking distance- about twenty minutes max, so one can get the sights but not the crowds.

Upon check in I was pleasantly surprised. Yes the hotel seems slightly outdated and offers little in the way of amenities but possesses a sort of simple charm . The room was small (as i expected) but very clean and we found the beds to be very comfortable. The area itself and the hotel were both very quiet and the staff was friendly enough. The area around the hotel is just wonderful, large street markets, resurants, cafes, stores ect were all around the area and it is within a 5 minute walk of the Villiers metro line, making it extraordinarily easy to get around Paris quickly (even for two people who have never ridden a subway). Stay away from the minibar as it will cost you about $5 for a single 12oz can of soda.

Pauline Frommer's guidebook had warned me to prepare my mind about size of room in paris. So its size is appreciately acceptable. Beds are clean, well-made. Furnitures are (too) simple and few. Power inputs are adequate. Bathroom is simple but comfortable. Shower head and controller can be easily manipulated. Hair dryer is included. The only thing that I dislike is the floor of bathroom and bedroom is continuously connected. No step or bar to block water on bathroom floor from carpet invasion and hard to prevent wet carpet after showering, there is no plastic curtain at the bathtub for sealing all splash from shower head.

We wanted an inexpensive little hotel to save some cash for fun. We got the \"little\" and a little more.

The Bad: - The interior room windows face other rooms and provide not an ounce of privacy for sound or sight when open and we didn't feel that our shade covered them appropriately either when closed. - The window coverings are thick opaque plastic with a tattered cloth cover so there is no natural light unless you want to display your room and yourself to 10 other guest rooms about 15 feet away. There is no option for a light curtain. - The rooms are very small - which we expected for an inexpensive European hotel so this wasn't horrible. - The bath has no real cover so when you shower water is hard to keep confined to the tub area. - Breakfast was so-so, no pure vegetarian options. If free it will suffice to most. - No hotel restaurant - but we didn't care because we usually don't partake anyway and there are restaurants on the street. The Ugly: - The rooms are in desperate need of an overhaul. I should be grateful that they are in bad shape because it allowed the low price, but it was uncomfortable. - The double bed was two twins (I am usually ok with this) but they were both sunken and hard so there was no \"crossing the line\" easily. I think this is the case with all \"doubles\" as they were permanently joined. - Anything permanent in the room that wasn't easily wiped down felt gross. ie: curtains, carpet, top bedspread. They are just way too old for a hotel.... stains, wear, etc. Do not believe the photos. Overall - we paid $75 USD (deal on Hotwire) and were fine with the stay because it was a nice cute neighborhood and the service was just fine.

Basically, if you are a group of young travellers go for it, but if you are a family or of an older generation, you won't get the peaceful holiday you are probably looking for.", "Date": "July 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monte Rio, California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel - Great location!!\u201d", "Author": "sailersaturn", "ReviewID": "UR5457823", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.

It was extremely clean and the staff was very friendly. We never felt unsafe walking back to the hotel in the evening.
