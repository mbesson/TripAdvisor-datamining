We travelled as a family with two young children. The hotel is about five minutes from two vaparettos, Ca' Dor and Fundemente Nouve. So well placed for sight seeing. However we walked more than caught the boat. It is a lot easier to get the water-boat (blue line) from Marco Polo than getting a bus or taxi then vaparetto. Whilst we were staying there, they had no bar and building work / decorating being done. However that didn't really bother us. There is a free bar,during the day in the breakfast room - which renders the mini bar pointless in my opinion. Unfortunately we weren't told of the free drinks until the second night. We had arrived about 7pm on a Monday and it would've been really helpful to know that we could have got free water, milk, juice, beer, cake etc. We had an executive room on the second floor which was already made up for us with a huge double bed, a sofa bed as well as a travel cot and we still had plently of space. The furnishings were very venetian. We had air conditioning in the room which worked, but because it was January, it didn't seem to warm the room but it wasn't too cold. The windows opened up to overlook a tiny canal. The bathroom had a bathtub with shower and toiletries. The safe was free to use and tea/coffee facilities were also in the room to be used with the fridge. The room was made up each day and every evening we returned to find the curtains had been closed, the bed turned down and dirty dishes taken away. Breakfast was until 11am and apart from the last day, we pretty much had the room to ourselves. You had a choice of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, toast, rolls, croissants, fruit, yoghurt, cereals, juice, tea, coffee and hot chocolate. The staff were wonderful. We could not fault them.

Una Hotel Venezia was just one hotel that grabbed my attention. Although initially put off Venice because of the perceived transfer hassle from the airport, I was quickly put right by an amazing transfer from Marco Polo Airport to Piazzale Roma. You have options to transfer by bus or train but also by boat which is very cool indeed. You can get a 3 day travel pass for ease and it is well worth it. Thereafter you can hop on and off the water taxis to see the most of Venice. In order to get to Una Hotel Venezia I would recommend either the Blue Line boat from the airport to Fontemente Nove and then a quick 5-7 mins walk through the residential back streets (this will give you a really good insight into the local area) or bus/train to Piazzale Roma and then water taxi #1 to Ca' D'Ora and then a quick walk across Strada Nova and then to the corner of Fond. Pruili where you will find the hotel. Externally, the hotel is easy to miss, nestled within the rather weathered residential buildings in the Carrregio district. There is no ostentatious signage or grand facade - just a very discrete sign outside right next to the canal just off the Grande Canal. However, when you walk through the sliding doors you will be met with a stylish vestibule and charming front of house staff. We were offered an upgrade straight away and the room was absolutely delightful - well appointed, great facilities and very comfortable. True Venetian class! Locally, the area is blessed with loads of traditional restaurants and bars mixed in with a great selection of shops. Carraregio is mainly for the locals and sufficiently far from the tourist traps but near enough so you don't need to spend hours getting to the fantastic monuments and attractions. The Rialto Bridge is about 5 mins walk away from the hotel and given the proximity to the water taxi stop on the Grande Canal, everything else is within easy reach. The hotel will be happy to help you out with directions and route planning. Don't buy a tourist map from the airport - the hotel have a much better one free! We had an absolutely fantastic time.

My wife and I travelled for our 5th wedding anniversary. We flew into VCE and took the water bus (Blue Line) to the Fondamenta Nove stop. From there it was a quick 5-10 min walk to the hotel. Make sure you have a Venice map with you, otherwise, you won't find it. You can buy a map at the airport or when you purchase your water bus tickets, they will give you one. Unfortunately, our luggage was lost by the airline, so upon arrival at the hotel the receptionist was very accomodating and took all the airline/luggage information. They called multiple times daily to check to see if the luggage had arrived. After a quick check in, we were escorted to our room which is outside at another door and up a flight of steps. Room #4. The rooms, as any Venetian hotel room, was on the small side, but was very adequate for a night's stay. It was actually quite opulent for what I expected. The bathroom had a nice toilet, bidet, glass shower and sink. The steam pipes for heating towels did not work, but that is the only thing that was wrong with the room. Interestingly, most hotels in Venice save power by requiring you to place your room keycard into a slot at the door which signals the lights to turn on. That made me feel even more happy about the room, as I was saving power. There was no loud noises overnight and we slept comfortably. The next morning we ate at the complimentary breakfast buffet. They of course had excellent breads. The eggs, meat and other food was average. They did have free mimosas which was a nice way to start off our anniversary.

It's delightful after a long day (I had been in for a shower in the middle of the day) to come into a tidy and clean room. It is also great to manually control the air-condition (possible to set to 0.0 celcius as minimum) if you are really hot from beein outside, which I was, and beeing able to cool yourself down in a matter of a short time. As for the interior, I love it. Not modern and minimalistic, but old-fashioned and baroquesqe, but not too much. It's greatly balanced. All in all this is a great hotel, and I won't think twice staying there for a second time. Actually I am that pleased that I won't even bother check for another hotel the next time I'll travel to Venice, which I will.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cGood location, brilliant staff\u201d", "Author": "apprendrelemonde", "ReviewID": "UR114806596", "Content": "Hotel with quite but central location, with really nice staff - they know what customer service means.

We asked about the water bus for our early morning flight the next day and they not only looked up the schedule for timing, but gave us a detailed map and offered to make us breakfast boxes to take with us since we would miss the breakfast buffet.

After reading hundreds of reviews on TripAdvisor, we chose the UNA Hotel. It was expensive (per American standards) but we were not disappointed. The staff is welcoming and polite, the rooms are clean and fairly spacious (we had an executive room). The room windows are soundproof but not the door. Thankfully, the guests were discreet. Upon arrival in the room, we noticed that the hairdryer wasn't working and we notified the front desk. In no time, there was a staff member in our room to replace it. The breakfast was even better than expected. There was food for every taste: pastries, cereals, fruits, scrambled eggs, sausages, ham, cheese, jam and even real Nutella! The fruit juices and coffee were fine. The hotel location is great and fairly easy to find, if you follow directions from the hotel web site, but you have to keep your eyes open because there's no hotel sign (beside the UNA logo on the brown banners hanging from the hotel room windows - see attached picture). You can also use Google map. If you stay at the UNA and fly to/from Venice, the Alilaguna boat line is the quickest way (besides water taxi). Every hour, it stops a the \"Fondmente Nove\" which is a 15 minute walk from the UNA hotel. Tickets can be purchased at the nearby ticket booth. The boat ride is about 45 minutes and the walk from the airport boat stop to the airport departure lounge is about 20 minutes. Public transport tickets can be purchased on line at veniceconnected.com. There's lots, I means LOTS of tourists in Venice, so our word of advice is: get up early and go to popular sites at the opening time (usually 9h00) to beat the crowd and walk away from the crowded area in the afternoon. If you spot a nice restaurant, make reservations or you might have to wait. If you find restaurants too expensive, there's a Billa grocery store on the busy Strada Nova street (towards North), about a 10-minute walk from the hotel. We had brought plenty of mosquito repellent but we didn't really need it. We saw only 2 mosquitoes during our 5-day stay but we would not have left the room windows open. The AC system was working fairly well. So, Venice is worth seeing, if you don't mind the crowds and the Italians speaking all the time ;).

Once we got our bearings it took us under ten minutes to walk to the Rialto and a further ten / fifteen from there to the Piazza San Marco depending on which route we took.

We looked around and wondered where the bed was,(I had booked one large room) trying one of two closed doors I was pleased to see the bedroom.

Bottled water in the mini-bar at 3 euros, this is penny pinching as at breakfast there is champagne freely available - sadly I do not drink alcohol only water. The breakfast was good, as long as you arrived early, cake, croissants, bacon, egg, juice, etc were not replenished if eaten by earlier guests. The waiters were very efficient. Maintenance appeared to be a problem, on return to our room one day during the afternoon the curtains had been closed presumably due to the sun, an arm chair near the window was leaning - one leg was broken - it stayed like that, propped on the broken leg for the rest of my stay. The shower control was loose and fell off several times, the toilet seat was not firmly fixed and felt insecure when in use, the sink and bidet plugs would not raise/lower by use of the lever, there was a large dirty stain across the sitting area floor. Two red flashing alarm lights above the bedroom door flashed constantly - why? There was a TV in each room with Sky - only one English station, the News. My suggestion to UNA Hotels is please teach your reception staff how to welcome guests, especially late on a very rainy Sunday night and show the guests what the many controls are for in their room. When we checked out there were several staff on reception, we were not asked if we had enjoyed our stay (5 nights) The good points are: hotel is very clean, spacious, bed huge, comfortable, kettle, tea/coffee in room and the location is very central. To reach the Hotel from the Grand Canal stop at Ca d'Oro, walk up to Strada Nova, straight across to Calle Delle Vele, over the bridge and the Hotel is on your right. Easy when you know. I have filled in the questionnaire on-line sent to me by UNA Hotels but it would not allow me to make all my comments. This hotel is expensive 1038 euros for 5 nights with breakfast, generally we enjoyed our stay but it would have been better without the above 'niggles'. We could have made our feelings known to the staff - if there wasn't the language barrier. Venice is pricy, pay for the multi-visit ticket when you visit the Churches -you get a map and can visit many churches, same at the museums. Buy the 12 hour or more tickets for the vaporetto, and try to obtain a card for visiting public toilets, they are very clean but priced at 1.50 euros per visit the cost soon mounts up, it is almost more economical to stop for coffee and use the toilet in the cafe.

My family came to Venice for 3 nights at the height of the Euro's appreciation against the dollar. There were three of us, so I'd like to comment on some of the other concerns and criticisms you might see here. Rooms: if you're looking for a roomy room here, consider springing for at least a superior room (for 2), or an executive room (for 3). I don't know about the B&Bs in Venice, but have enough experience in Mediterranean Europe to know that it's exceedingly rare for the basic room from a major hotel chain to hold even 2 people comfortably. It's sad, but that's life in the big cities, and in Italy, UNA counts as a major chain. Location: we like being able to sleep at night, and we're not big fans of 3 AM urban street noise. If your vision of romantic is looking out upon massive crowds at your window 24-7, there are plenty of well-regarded B&Bs closer to St. Mark's. Otherwise, you'll have a fine rest alongside regular Venetians as your neighbors. And you can still see canals from your window. Price: yes, it's pricey, but at a time when 1 Euro was as much as US$1.80, Venice gave us sticker shock no matter where we looked, even in the rattiest hostel. If you're only 2 people, try 4-5 stars on priceline & hotwire first, but beyond bidding $250/night, forget it! You might get lucky on UNA's website with special offers. We did (for 3 people), and have no regrets, because regular prices at Best Western, Starwood, Boscolo, Hilton, Bauer, or any other 4-5 star chain on the islands are mortifying, regardless of whether you search on Orbitz, Hotels, Expedia, Travelocity, Venere, HolidayCity, etc. So assuming you're not swimming in waist deep Adriatic winter seawater at Christmas time, enjoy Venice.

It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the very center, San Marco square, but I wouldn't advice to get a hotel in the most central areas because the amount of tourists and gift shops take all of the \"romantic potential\" out of Venice! We found one of the nicest places to visit in Venice just a few blocks from the hotel. The Jesuit Church of the Assumption. Also I would advice you to avoid the San Marco area as much as possible and walk around Dorsodouro, Cannaregio and San polo areas which take less tourists and are much nicer.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cA great location\u201d", "Author": "CharlotteCJH", "ReviewID": "UR23269969", "Content": "The first thing to know about this hotel is that there is also a Hotel Luna!

So please be sure you say and even spell \"Una!\" The hotel is a great location for walking to everything we desired. Much like the rest of Venice, I imagine, every canal, alley and bridge around were just so beautiful. We really enjoyed walking everywhere we went and we found many great restaurants within a very short distance. Our first night, we ate at Algiubagio which we found by mistake searching for one recommended by the hotel. We had AMAZING service there and the food was great. Overall, the hotel was a good landing place. The bath was beautiful and peaceful for a nice hot bath after a rainy travel day. Our room decor and layout was very well done and everything was tremendously clean. The staff at the front desk was very helpful the first night with our taxi issue but on day two when they ran out of umbrellas (we had used one earlier in the day), we had some difficulty getting help. We asked for garbage bags to put on over our clothing as it was pouring outside but the front desk man was not very accommodating. For a rainy trip in Venice, this was a great location.

Room -- Our room seemed large for a european hotel with a sofa, large closet and bathroom with a tub/shower (all-in-one). Every toiletry imaginable was provided and much appreciated. Location -- We were so grateful that we did not stay in the main tourist area as it was a very, very crowded. After being in the crowds all day, we really enjoyed ending our day in a nearby cafe enjoying a drink before heading to the room to clean up for dinner. That said, the hotel is only a short walk to any of the city attractions. I also really enjoyed shopping in the nearby boutiques and walking to the outdoor market. Breakfast & Food -- Typical cheese, pastries, fruit, cereal, etc. Everything was fresh. We also twice ordered from their limited snack menu. My husband still says it is the best caprese salad he has ever eaten. Staff -- Everyone was friendly and helpful. Also, everyone in the front desk and in the breakfast/snack area spoke English which was really helpful. Complaints/Things to be aware of - Only one: no a/c in the common areas. We were staying during the height of the tourist season we had to be out of our room on time as they were fully booked and expecting guests. Which was no problem at all except we were catching the Orient Express later that afternoon and wanted to stay \"fresh\" in our suit/dress. Well, it was a particularly hot day and the common areas are not air conditioned. Since we had booked a water taxi to the train station (we splurged in vain to again be fresh) we couldn't leave early with our bags to somewhere with a/c & were stuck in this incredibly hot common room. As it turned out, it really didn't matter b/c the Orient Express also does not have a/c but if I was about to take an intl. flight, it would not have been a very uncomfortable flight....", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake District, Cumbria", "Title": "\u201cVenice is fantastic and so was the hotel!\u201d", "Author": "AutumnBreeze_8", "ReviewID": "UR22287114", "Content": "Our flight got us there at around ten at night so we went straight to the water taxi desk at arrivals.

The staff were brilliant and couldn't do enough for us. The room was real luxury and it appears that they upgrade everyone on arrival if the hotel isn't too full. Breakfast was great and a good start to a busy day walking around. Strada Nova (2 minutes from hotel) had some lovely shops including a dog clothes shop. It had a nice local feel. Rialto bridge was just a few minutes further on and San Marco Square 10 minutes further on. It does get cold at this time of year but we got some lovely sunshine too. Out of season Venice is great, not too busy and you get to see all the local Italians...very chic!! DON'T EAT AT THE IGUANA RESTAURANT! It was billed in my book as having live latin music. No music, very cold with just a little heater sitting on a nearby table. The food was also cold when it arrived. Chilli mince beef should surely be thoroughly heated through before serving and the salad was brown with age! However, we did see someone walking a ferret outside so it wasn't all bad.

We totally agree with Writerwriter who has left a very accurate summary of this hotel. Dont get us wrong, its fine but the feedback elevates it to a very high rating which may be misleading to some travellers, especially if they travel and stay in decent hotels on a regular basis. On the plus side, the hotel is spotlessly clean, very modern and the staff are very attentive. On the downside, the rooms are not big, we were in an Executive room which I had to query as it was pretty small (but then I guess most rooms in Venice are etc). Breakfast is adequate but cramped (and no tomatoes - in italy...are they mad?) and the coffee room is ludicously small (e.g. if two other couples are in there, you wont get a seat). The hotel has Aircon/Heating but you cannot control this in your room as its on a master control (why would they do this???). Our room was too hot so I contacted reception and was told that there was nothing they could do. Leaving the windows open would be fine as it is very quiet but you will spend most of the night chasing mozzies around your room (even in October!). What really dissapointed us was that we booked directly with the hotel and asked them to make it special as it was our honeymoon but they did absolutely nothing for us. I even mentioned this again when querying the room size/type and they still did nothing. Given this was an expensive 5 night stay, it wouldn't have taken much to pop a bottle of prosecco and some chocs in the room for arrival. Mrs T was most unimpressed! At the end of the day if you want a nice small modern hotel in a very quite (but well situated) location (and are happy to spend all of your 'hotel' time in your room) then this will be fine for you. I wouldn't recommend this for honeymooners as its not romantic enough, they do nothing special for you and the lack of a decent bar/restaurant is a real downer as you'll need to go out for a nice drink and a chat etc. If i was to visit venice again I would go for a more lively location and book a larger hotel with a decent restaurant and a bar with some ambiance.

Everything about it is top notch. The hotel is in a quiet location and therefore slightly off the beaten path, which we liked very much. It is easy to access from the Ca d'Oro vaporetto stop--just 2 quick blocks. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone spoke English quite well so communication was easy given our limited but manageable Italian. We got answers to all our questions about directions, places we wanted to visit, and restaurant reservations. The amenities just go on and on. We had an executive room. The linens, the decor, everything was quite luxe. The bathroom was to die for. Great soaking tub that was a godsend after a long day of touring. They provided 2 types of bath salts and numerous other toiletry items, and additionally offered a men's and women's kit separately, that contained moisturizer, manicure kit, face cream, etc. The dining room served breakfast as well as a limited dinner menu (can't recall if there was lunch because we were always out during that time). The dining staff was extremely friendly and professional. The hotel is spotlessly clean and kept up. We arrived in Venice by train and took a water taxi to the hotel because we had quite a bit of luggage and weren't exactly sure where we were going. It cost us 60 euros. You do have to cross one bridge if you take the vaporetto, but in retrospect, I think we could have managed it. We left Venice by air so we took the Alilaguna water shuttle, which is about 8 mins walk from the Hotel Una. You'll have to cross 2 bridges (translation-up and down 4 sets of steps leading to and from those bridges). From the Fondamenta Nuova water stop, it took about 40 mins to get to Marco Polo airport. Just be aware you'll have to lug your baggage another 7 minutes from the place you disembark from the Alilaguna boat, so have some change ready for use of the luggage carts (1 euro) if you gave a lot of luggage.

First, the good things. Very clean, well decorated, friendly staff. A stylish feel, in an old arcaded building. They had free tea in the evenings, and tea and coffee making in the rooms. Neutral: Location was quaint and not too far from restaurants and a vaporetto stop but was quite residential and very dead in the evenings. Breakfast ample and varied but quality mediocre - dry scrambled eggs, packets of processed cheese, catering quality yogurt, dull pastries. No coffee shop alternatives handy. Negatives: our room (cheapest price range) VERY small, no room for a bedside table or even shelf on one side. Bathroom stylish but very cramped, no shelves, toilet roll holder too close to use if you were seated on the toilet! I am tall but if I had been obese would have been impossble to use the bathroom. A/c switched off so the stuffy room could not be cooled. We kept the window open but this was so near the bed it caused a draft and mosquitoes came in! The room was VERY dark, and none of the hotel ever got any sunlight. I did not feel like returning to this hotel nor look forward to waking up in it. There was a lot of public space with big wide corridors but nothing was arranged to give guests anywhere comforatble to sit in the evening. The breakfast room doubled as the bar, crammed with dinky tiny tables, the one guest lounge was really tiny & dominated by a silent TV. But the bedroom was too small to sit in comfortably. As a 3 star this would have been OK. As a four star - hm.
