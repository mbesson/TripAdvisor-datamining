The room was spacious, with a very helpful small kitchen and a small bathroom, besides a comfortable bed. Sleep quality was very good, with little noise coming from the street. Sutton Court has a good location, almost on the corner of 57th and 1st. The neighborhood is fine and less crowded than a more central Midtown Manhattan address. There are two supermarkets and some pharmacies nearby, and a wine store right next door. You're gonna find coffee houses and restaurants all around the region. My biggest complaint refers to the distance from the subway. Although being very well located, it was a 10-minute walk to the nearest station. This is not a really bad problem, but keep it in mind if you need to take the train daily and you don't like, don't want or simply can't walk this distance. Obviously you can also take a bus (there's a stop close to the hotel) or a taxi.

My wife never wanted to go to New York so it was with some relief that I found the room to be as expected and for the two weeks we found no reason to regret our choice of Sutton Court. My wife now likes New York! NYC is such a big city that it is difficult to decide where to stay. Initially we accepted advice to stay near Times Square but now, having been there, we realize that would have been a mistake. They say NYC never sleeps and that's because the car horns and the racket of emergency service vehicles keeps everybody awake all night! The crowds around Times Square and the constant noise of the place would make this a poor accommodation location if the price didn't deter you. We settled on Sutton Court because it was away from the din but was still within reasonable walking distance of many of the places we planned to visit. It's near the corner of East 57th and First Avenue and the subway is at East 59th and Lexington which is a five minute walk. The neighbourhood is pleasant enough and there are three grocery stores within 100m, albeit very expensive (the fruit barrow on the adjacent corner is much cheaper). The front desk staff are pleasant and helpful and the room itself was very good. We had a south facing room on the 27th level. Initially we booked through Veneer.com as the property's own website showed no vacancies. When we emailed Laysee about some minor details we asked if we could have a high floor, south facing and she explained that the Veneer reservations only get the lower, unrenovated, floors so we agreed to pay $40 per night extra and I'm glad we did. The property is comprised of two buildings connected at the ground floor level. Our room was in the much taller tower behind the building that fronts 57th Street and at one stage probably fronted 58th Street. Each floor has four units, two facing north and two facing south. There are no windows facing east or west. From our room we could see the tops of the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and the East River. On the northern side you would miss this view and those rooms overlook the Queensborough bridge which carries a lot of traffic and may be noisier (but I can't confirm this). Despite the name, this is a serviced apartment facility with a 24 hour front desk. It has a gym but this was being renovated when we were there. We didn't need the exercise anyway as we walked and walked and walked each day! Units are supplied with initial linen and towels and one change of everything which was adequate for us. If you want fresh towels or linen you pay extra. I'm not sure what the situation is if you book a longer stay. In any event there is a guest laundry where you can wash your stuff yourself. The room is furnished basically but adequately. The website photos are accurate although taken when everything was sparkling new. The small kitchen has pretty much all you'd need unless you were doing some serious cooking - but, hey, who does that when they're on holiday? A full sized fridge and cooker is useful. The bed was huge and very comfortable. If you can tolerate the rubbish on US TV there's two flat screens. Internet is via a cable connection. WiFi in the lobby is available but if you want wireless in the room they need to plug in a router and they charge $10 a week for this. This is probably the only criticsm I'd offer - why nickel and dime people on stuff like this when they are paying $5,300 for their two weeks?? Another minor gripe was the AC unit in our room seemed to have it's own ideas about when it should operate. It did not have a timer function but still managed to turn itself on and off at uncommanded times. Whilst on the negatives, it's probably unfair to lump this in on Sutton Court's review, but we received an email from Veneer when we booked initially that said the terms of booking for this property were that we paid on check in. In fact Suttons terms are they put a charge through on the credit card ten working days before your stay. In our case a $5,300 charge against a debit card came close to overdrawing our account. Fortunately I was onto the account activity daily and had transferred suifficient money into the account to meet the charge. A disconnect between Veneer and Sutton obviously. The entire building is being renovated and appears to have been going on forever. However this work proceeds at times which are convenient to the guests. I think they don't start until after nine in the morning and finish late afternoon. They were at pains to make sure we understood this before we booked but to be honest we hardly heard them. After all, most guests would be up and out before they start work and not back before they finished. A highlight was the snowfall in our second week. Being from a land where snow in cities is unheard of, it was a novelty for us. The staff were quick to provide umbrellas on days when the weather was inclement. All in all an enjoyable stay and I have no hestitation in recommending this property to others.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bendigo, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDream hotel!\u201d", "Author": "idontdobudget", "ReviewID": "UR117905573", "Content": "We stayed here over the Christmas/New years period for 2 weeks and had the best time ever.

There were renovations going on in the penthouse when we were there but there were no noise issues or problems at all. Staff were very helpful (extra donnas, pillows, taxis, restaurants, act.). We stayed in the hotel for Christmas eve and day and having the kitchen was great so that we could cook our own roast dinner. Fantastic amenities, tv, bathroom kitchen.

The hotel is a close walk to Subways and lots of major attractions, the area is clean and safe and there is a grocery store right around the corner which is wonderful when you have the full kitchen in the room. The fact that we had free wi-fi and local AND long-distance calling blew our tops off.... I mean, how many other places can you stay and have free long-distance calling?!

All the reviews I read had been positive and we are happy to add our own very positive feedback from our stay. Our room was very quiet (we requested a quiet room), so though we were in a busy midtown location, we heard nothing of the street noise. The location was perfect and a short walk to subway, bus routes and all everyday amenities: restaurants, grocery stores (d'Agostino across the street on 1st Avenue was more than adequate for all our grocery needs. Food Emporium was rather too much, we found), pharmacies, and a huge variety of shops, including Bloomingdales. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful with suggestions on places to visit, restaurants, etc. The free broadband inernet and free calling within Canada and the USA were a real bonus given our relatively long stay. There were some hitches with the internet and it's not the world's fastest, but it was adequate. Also there are problems with multiple users. If there is more than one laptop user I 'd recommend renting their wireless router for a very reasonable $10 a week. Our bachelor suite was very spacious, much bigger than the average NY hotel room, and very well equipped, particularly the kitchen, which came complete with mini dishwasher, crockery and a good range of kitchen utensils. And the bed! Hands down, both of us found it THE MOST comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in. As others have said, the lack of daily maid service was not a problem-it is an apartment hotel, after all, and we could always request it when needed for an extra charge. With all the restaurants and grocery stores close at hand, we didn't miss a hotel restaurant either.The gym is small but adequate for a hotel, with all the basics. With all the walking you do in NY, we didn't end up using it. All in all, this place was a real find in terms of value for money in a very expensive city. It was perfectly located for our needs, clean, comfortable and very well equipped. It is not high end luxurious, but we weren't looking for that and it was great, especially for an extended stay. We would gladly stay here again and highly recommend it to other visitors to NYC.

The location's pretty good for transport - a couple of blocks from the subway and on a good north/south bus route. There aren't many great places to eat nearby, but there's a good food store just around the corner (Food Emporium, on 59th). Service is pretty non-existent - the only people there on weekends are from a security firm - so if you need anything on a weekend, you're out of luck. And even though we had problems during our stay, when we checked out, noone asked how our stay was. The price is pretty good for New York (i.e. jaw-droppingly expensive for anywhere execpt New York!) if you're staying for more than a week. As for the apartment itself, the whole place is a very good size for two people, the kitchen is well equipped for basic needs (although there really are NO provisions, leading to bizarre things like empty salt and pepper shakers), the sofa is comfy, the shower is good (although the bath's tiny), the bed is good quality (soft but not squishy) and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is nice, if a bit ordinary and uninspiring. Neither of the TVs worked properly and the internet didn't work at all - which made us very cross as high-speed internet was one of the plus points of the apartments. But the worst thing about our stay was the noise. I live in a city. I am used to noise. But 24/7 traffic noise, car horns and sirens, so loud you feel like you're actually sleeping ON the bridge, is just crazy. Even on the 14th floor, we could only sleep with the white noise of the fan, which we turned to high. I suggest you ask for a room at the front of the hotel and on as high a floor as possible, as I guess there would be less noise, but we never saw one of the apartments on that side (we asked to move, but noone who was actually in the hotel on the weekend we arrived had the authority to move us).
