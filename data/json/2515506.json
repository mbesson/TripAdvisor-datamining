My room in particular was next to the fire escape which made me feel very unsafe since there was a door to the outside right outside my room. The noise was ridiculous - a water running noise all day and night and thin walls make you hear every sneeze from adjacent rooms - and even knocks on other doors. The housekeeping staff and engineering staff was very friendly. Oh, and the TV is smaller than your computer screen.

It is a pleasant, safe walk to the harbor and the Gaslamp district. I don't think I would stay at this hotel if I had energetic, school-age kids, as the room seemed small and there wasn't a pool or game room or such. On the other hand, that also could be seen as a benefit... :--) The check-in staff were friendly, the \"tour desk\" folks were really helpful, and we really enjoyed a Saturday freebie tour of the Gaslamp district (offered by the hotel). We appreciated being supplied with bottled water every day. The only downsides were intermittent TV reception and small, non-ADA bathrooms. I don't know if the hotel offers ADA-accessible rooms, but if this is something you need, you would be wise to inquire about it before making a reservation. The hotel has been tastefully restored, with interesting historical sconces in the hallways. Sometimes it is fun to stay in a place that ISN'T a national, mega-hotel chain. We reserved the hotel as part of an online travel package, getting really good room rates. Additionally, we were upgraded when we checked in, which was a nice touch as well.

Overall its a great hotel in a decent--not perfect--location. This historic hotel was renovated about 6 years ago and is roughly 4 blocks from where all of the downtown San Diego action begins. My room was petite, but packed with great modern amenities and a sleek decor. For the price I paid ($100), I couldn't have been happier... almost! On first glance, I thought the hotel deserved a solid 4 stars, but come 3a.m. I had the impression that I was back in a fraternity house--a room over, someone was enjoying a sensual moment and the walls are THIN. However, the late night escapades weren't my only noise issue. By 8a.m. it felt like the hotels housekeeping team (they were excellent by the way) was strategizing which room to clean next from the foot of my bed. Another concern, the shower! The rooms should come with \"slippery when wet\" signs. Although nicely tiled, the shower didn't have a door to prevent water from spilling on the bathroom floor. So, post scrub down, you best watch your step! Overall, the photo's on tripadvisor and on The Sofia's webpage are fairly accurate in terms of what you see is what you get. I enjoyed my visit and for the price would probably stay again.

Despite confusion at the front desk over a living-social deal where we purchased a suite but the hotel initially checked us into a regular room, the Sofia Hotel is a terrific and centrally located near 4 star hotel in sunny San Diego. Since we were incorrectly checked into a regular king size room, we were able to view both the standard accommodations, as well as the reg suite. The standard room was small, but very charming. The Sofia is a historic, older hotel, and the room's character reflects this history: smaller sq. footage, high ceilings, various unique floor plans, not the cookie cutter layout of some newer hotel buildings. Staying as a couple in the standard room may present a challenge to some. So to avoid feeling cramped, I suggest paying more and staying in one of the suites. The suites are much more spacious. Granted these rooms may not be as large as 5 star, luxury locales, but nonetheless, the suites at the Sofia are terrific. With the sunny and window-abundant front parlor, connected to a private cozy bedroom, the suites at the Sofia provide comfortable, home-like retreats for the traveler visiting downtown SD. And the bathroom's original layout was cute and comfortable, most likely very similar to its original early nineteenth century design. There are various restaurants/cafes nearby (a chipotle, coffee bean & tea leaf to name a few), including the terrific and beautifully adorned Currant brasserie attached to the hotel, with its checkered tile floors, and flying buttresses that bridge the pillars and columns high above. All in all, the Sofia Hotel is a near 4-star, convientally located and peaceful retreat, within the vibrant and colorful downtown San Diego scene. (And I don't know what a certain trip advisor reviewer was talking about when he or she remarked that the neighbor surrounding the hotel was \"seedy\". Have you been to downtown LA or SF?

Pros: Front desk staff was super friendly, as was the bell man. Barely even spoke to the valet guys, they were too busy chatting up the cute girls dressed up for Mardi Gras and we had to ask them to take our keys. Location, location, location... so close to the harbor, convention center, and gaslamp district... *some* of the amenities... yoga studio was nice, if it wasn't for the jackhammer and construction going on right outside. There is a small fitness area, but I have to admit I was taken with the yoga studio, if it wasn't for the noise. Wifi was \"free\" once you paid a $8/night fee for \"amenities.\" I still don't understand that. Especially because I wasn't given an option, they just added this to the bill they have beach cruiser bikes for you to rent at no cost (probably included with the \"amenities\" charge... they were really nice bikes, and was an awesome way to get around the city for a few hours. CONS: Construction... LOUD construction outside the hotel... we woke up after Mardi Gras celebrations to a jackhammer (not the best way to wake up post Mardi Gras). Parking... $30!!!! I didn't see a sign for self park at the hotel. I probably wouldn't be as upset about the parking charge, but that valet was completely distracted the time we checked in and when we were leaving trying to retrieve our car. After texting the number they give you to have your car brought up, we still waited close to 20 minutes to have our car brought up. Room: SMALL! Super small. I know when you come to San Diego you aren't supposed to stay in your hotel room, things are just too beautiful in the city to miss, but when you have to move furniture in the room so that you can hang 2 dress shirts and a coat in the closet, there's something wrong with the situation. The view... what view?! our window faced a brick wall, no joke. We faced a brick wall and the window looking into another room.

The hotel staff were really friendly and so helpful from the bellboys to the concierge, our room staff and especially the front desk. Yes, the room was quite compact! Good practice for our cruise a couple of days later! The bathroom was lovely, had all the amenities we needed and a lovely comfy bed.

From the moment we pulled up to the Sofia Hotel, where we were greeted curbside by a friendly valet, the charming mix of old and new was abundant. Born of a $16 million renovation of San Diego\u2019s historic Pickwick Hotel, the Sofia Hotel has an exceptionally decorated lobby with classic, old world charm and a smartly-dressed staff who were pleasant, helpful and efficient. Check-in was very smooth and in no time we were settling into our room. The spacious room offered a living room complete with couch, chairs, desk, table, drawers, and a television. Efficiently designed and comfortably appointed with a chic tone, the luxuries were in the detail. Our suite had an updated, modern bathrooms with a unique layout in that the sink and counter were in the throughway to the bedroom, opposite a shower and toilet chamber enclosed by a space-saving sliding door. Fine linen, with plush pillows made for a comfortable night\u2019s rest. Gilchrist & Soames spa products and toiletries made even quick showers a delightful experience. The suite also included a microwave and a miniature fridge that came in handy during our four-day stay. The bedroom also had a television as well as a safe for storage of valuables. While the TVs were a bit smaller then in some other hotels they offered a wide range of channels including both free and on-demand movie channels and local information channels. Dining options were abundant as not only did the hotel offer its own bar and restaurant, the Currant Brasserie, but there were numerous restaurants as well as shopping options within an easy walk of the hotel. The Currant has been rated the best French Bistro in town and each evening offers and amazing specialty popcorn. I had expected it to be simply new seasonings and was happy to experience, meat, cheese, and other delights when it arrived. The hotel also offers spa services and the 24-hour Harkishan Yoga Studio and Health Center provides yoga mats and surround sound system and an on-call yoga instructor is available. The pet-friendly hotel also partners with Dogs and the City to offer pet care services such as grooming or in-room pet sitting. I strongly suggest taking advantage of the local area station on the in room cable service as I learned about some great venues in the area as well as a famous pancake resturant which has garnered national praise. While parking downtown can be a bit of an issue the Sofia offers valet parking at $30 a day. The valet service was extremely efficient and helpful and a couple of times provided directions that were even better than our GPS could provide. There are also numerous lots in the surrounding blocks which offer numerous options for guests. The hotel charges a resort fee of $12.00 per day which includes complementary Internet access as well as other amenities such as bottled water. Since this was a working trip, I was extremely grateful to have reliable access to the Internet and a comfy room in which to unwind after an extremely long day in a city that offers countless activities. Sadly our time went by very quickly but we were given and very friendly and prompt check out, and the reception desk even offered us coupons to a local dining facility. From a great room and very friendly staff, we cannot wait for a return visit to this charming hotel.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel stay EVER!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "euexplorer", "ReviewID": "UR121421014", "Content": "I decided to treat myself to a 4 star after a 20 hour trip to San Diego.

However I am not picky and the only thing that really matters to me is the ability to get a good nights sleep.

I really had no idea what to expect; the pictures looked nice enough though some reviewers had complained that the rooms were too small. The hotel staff was kind enough to let me check in at noon, which was fantastic because I was pretty tired from my flight. Second, they upgraded me to a queen sized bed (I had booked a double) at no extra charge! Be advised that they charge a tourist tax of about $7, which probably isn't included in whatever you paid online (I found this annoying, but not a deal-breaker). The interior of the hotel is lovely. Although it doesn't look new, it's very well taken care of. The fireplace in the little lounge next to the lobby is a nice touch, especially in winter. I'd disagree with the reviewers who complained that the rooms were too small; they're somewhat bigger than you would find in a 4-star hotel in Central Europe. Granted, they may not be massive, sprawling affairs, but they're certainly big enough to be comfortable. The rooms are tastefully decorated, clean, and comfortable. My sole complaint was that the shower door design is strange, and leads to a wet bathroom floor (annoying, but nothing more). The location couldn't possibly be any better. You're a ten-minute walk from the waterfront, five minutes from a decent mall, and maybe fifteen minutes from the Gaslamp district. Plenty of dining and shopping options are at your fingertips, which makes this hotel a good choice if you don't have a car.

Walked to a show and out to the gas lamp area. Great location for walking day or night. Parking at the hotel is exspensive so we parked in old town (free) and caught the trolly into town.

The hotel staff was pleasant overall. However, the rooms are super small. Like: NYC or European-hotel-room-small. I actually had 2 nights of unpleasant sleep for a few reasons. First, I could hear people outside in the hallways throughout the night. I'd characterize the hotel guests as relatively young overall so there were people who were heading out for the night and yelling about taking shots when we were trying to fall asleep. (I probably should've asked them for a shot, it could have helped me sleep.) Second, the hotel is located next to or near a fire station so you can hear the sirens of the fire trucks when they're called out in the night. Third, I found I could hear the guests in the room next door in the morning when they were speaking to one another. Not ideal. My final issue was the silly shower situation: yes it's a lovely shower with pretty tile, great water pressure and plenty of hot water. But I have a feeling the folks who designed the shower stalls decided to keep the shower space open (the glass doesn't fully enclose the shower) for aesthetic reasons and to make the space seem larger. However, it simply succeeds in getting water on the floor. Not a huge deal but something that could be viewed as a bit annoying.

It's away from the hubbub of the convention center (where you invariably run into someone after convention hours) has been nicely refurbished in a sort of contemporary Art Deco style, has a friendly, courteous staff (except for one guy, Kleeber, who ought to be in the backroom and NOT dealing with customers). The rooms are small. After all, it's a hotel built in, what, the 1930s? But they make optimal use of the layout using sliding doors and compact cabinets. As with everyone else, I think $30 is a lot to pay for parking...and then I think of how much it is to park in downtown San Francisco...and then I shrug my shoulders. So I figure, we are in downtown San Diego. The valets are VERY helpful. I needed stuff form my car several times the first day and they were cheerful and prompt. I wasn't crazy about the food at the Currant restaurant but that may be because I'm not a fan of sauces on my food: the savory sauce on my calamari obscured the taste of the calamari, which is what I wanted to taste. The steak sandwich had a bernaise-like sauce (I think) that hid the essence of the steak. But that's more personal preference on my part. Kleeber...such a dude, especially when compared to the service orientation of his colleagues (like Assistant Manager McClain, Brian and the concierge, whose name I've forgotten). I woke up at 4:30 am the first day, found that I forgot my razor. I went downstairs to ask for one. Two desk people were there. Kleeber, who was looking at his screen (and never looked up)and another desk person, who was helping two people. It was ONLY when the busy desk person asked Kleeber to help me that Kleeber looked up from his screen. (Yep, Kleeber, can't lose those google searches or whatever you were looking at on the screen, even when you are on the clock, huh?) I asked Kleeber for a razor. He looked, then said they ran out. I asked him what I could do. He said I could go to the 7-11 and buy one. That's when I looked at his name badge, said it aloud and started walking away. Then, knowing I was annoyed, he said that they could go to the 7-11 and get one for me. I replied saying that that was a good answer since the hotel info binder said they had spare razors and such for forgetful people like me. (Turns out the 7-11 didn't sell them, so management sure has to get some spares in.) I don't fault the desk people for no having a razor available. That's management's job. But someone with Kleeber's service attitude really should not be dealing with the paying public. I'll surely stay at the Sofia the next time I am in San Diego but I'll do two things: be sure I have a razor and, if Kleeber is still on the desk, wait for someone else to help me. Surely, he won't help anyone that he interacts with.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, service and rates - very small rooms and beds\u201d", "Author": "blindlemonpie", "ReviewID": "UR110032087", "Content": "So whats good about this hotel, i) it's downtown and very close to the Gaslamp District (5 mins walk), also only 10 mins walk from the waterside, ii) good service (complimentary drink at the bar, free access to bikes for guests, a walking tour service etc, iii) great rates, we paid $101 a night.

Like other visitors have mentioned the rooms are very small. There's just enough space for your luggage and not much else. However my problem was with the cleanliness. On arrival to our room, I noticed that there was a yellow stain on the toilet seat. The toilet seat was also very worn and there was brown material showing through, which made it seem even more unappealing. As I was exhausted after a long day of travelling, I couldn't be bothered complaining so I wiped the stain off myself. A few nights in, the toilet started leaking, which was rather disturbing. The other gripe that I have with the Sofia Hotel is the fact that there was a Guest Service fee of sorts which was not made clear to me at all. It was not mentioned upon booking, nor by staff when checking in, or in any of the brochures or information booklet provided by the hotel. I happily paid a similar fee at the MGM Grand, as this was made clear multiple times. Upon checking out of the Sofia, we were slapped by this unexpected fee which left a bitter taste in my mouth, and we were unaware of the fact that we were paying for these \"amenities\" hence we never took advantage of them. The Sofia Hotel is centrally located, and the San Diego Zoo is a short bus ride away. The Greyhound terminal is next door which means there are some sketchy characters hanging around at all times of day, but which is pretty handy if you're planning on taking the bus. The Gaslamp District, waterfront and Horton Plaza shopping mall are nearby. The attached restaurant, Currant, is also pretty nice.

The bellman started to laugh at me and says to me \u201cwhat?, can\u2019t print something?\u201d. The bellman slouches way back in the chair and starts printing off sheets and cavalierly hands them to me. They were blank, obviously from the lack of ink.

I had never been so close to having my girlfriend and I jump back in my car and take our chances finding a new place. Next time, I will go with my instincts\u2026 Now back to the fun. The elevator was extremely small. At most, it would fit 4-5 people and we see a couple struggling to get their baby stroller inside. We wait for the next car. Once in the elevator, we notice the odd d\u00e9cor. Strange vinyl laminate on the floor of a picture of rocks mixed with old wood paneling on the walls. The door on the elevator closes and the elevator jerks and drops suddenly. It gets us to our floor and we quickly get out. We nervously laugh and call it the Bates Motel and both assure ourselves that it couldn\u2019t get any worse. We get to our room and one of the keys isn\u2019t programmed properly. Luckily we had a second key that did work or I was dreading another visit to Gabriella, aka \u201cMiss Congeniality\u201d. The room is extremely small. So small that you see a sink as soon as you open the door. We walk in and we see the smallest flat screen TV that we have ever seen. Maybe a diameter of 14\u201d. We joke and say it helps to make the room look bigger. We open the curtains and \u201cour city view\u201d is the old Grayhound Bus terminal. I tried to turn on the light next to the bed but it was burned out. My girlfriend goes into the bathroom and the toilet wouldn\u2019t flush properly. One had to hold it down until the cycle was completely done. The kicker was the size of the bathroom. The bathroom was so small that there was no bathtub, the shower length was only about 5 feet and they couldn\u2019t install a door on the shower as there wouldn\u2019t be enough room to open outwards. Instead they had a half glass wall on the left-hand side. The problem with this design was that the shower knobs were on the right side and the shower head was on the left, so when one turns on the water, the stream would hit you in the face and body if you wanted to warm up the shower while you were getting undressed. In addition, with only a half glass wall on the left-hand side, the showerhead would shoot the water out onto the floor of the bathroom and would pour into our hallway. Would never stay there again and obviously, I am taking the time to write this lengthy review to warn others about the Sophia Hotel.

Reasons why I enjoyed it so much: 1) The staff: The first night I checked in, the front desk staff asked me what brought me to town and how they could be of assistance during my stay. The days following as I passed by the front desk I was greeted by name and asked how my research was going, how my stay was, etc. They provided me with maps of the area, restaurant recommendations, scenic routes for my morning runs, and directions. They were extremely attentive. The housekeeping staff did a wonderful job. No complaints there. 2) The room: Yes, they are small but this is a boutique hotel--not a Sheraton or Marriott. But, for a solo traveler (and even if I traveled with my spouse) the room was big enough for what I needed. Didn't spend a lot of time in the room. The bed: one of the most comfortable I've slept in--soft sheets, extra pillows, duvet. Bathroom: rainhead shower, large, soft towels, above-counter sink (spa-like atmosphere), lighted make-up mirror (Huge plus!). Wireless connection (daily fee), desk, comfy chair, bottles of water, fridge and microwave. Everything I needed. 3) Restaurant: Currant Brasserie is connected to The Sofia and I ate there three out of six nights (better food and deal than the restaurants around the gaslamp quarter). Their happy hour specials are a very good deal (1/2 price burgers, appetizers, etc) and I met a number of locals who eat there for their delicious food. Great wait staff. 4) Location: One block from great shopping at Horton Plaza, Gaslamp Quarter, minutes from the water, coffee shop right outside the hotel. I felt very safe walking around at night by myself. 5) Fitness Center: May not be a big deal to some, but I work out every day and their fitness center was very nice: medicine balls, bosu, weight machines, treadmills with TVs, and a separate yoga studio. There were dvds, mats, and all the yoga equipment in the studio to have your own yoga session. But running alongside the water in the morning is quite beautiful... If I ever need to go back to San Diego, i will definitely stay at The Sofia.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yuma, AZ", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and decent hotel\u201d", "Author": "drneideffer", "ReviewID": "UR91841949", "Content": "We stayed here for New Year's 2011.

The hotel itself is very modern and hipster in feel and ambiance. The lobby and ajoining restaurant are quite plush and inviting. The location is great. In San Diego, when choosing to stay downtown then assuming you want some nightlife and a bit of a scene then you really should stay near or within the Gaslamp Quarter. This is basically a 16 block radius of restaurants, bars, shops and nightclubs. The Sofia is just on the fringes of it and thus offers the best of both worlds: close enough to walk to and from your night out but just far enough away that the noise from the local establishments won't keep you up until the wee hours if you have planned on having an early night. In terms of location, the Sofia is in a better location than the similarly priced Gaslamp Plaza Suites which I stayed at in 2009 and have previously posted a review for. Some people have commented on the Sofia's proximity to the Greyhound Bus Depo and the problems this causes in relation to the close proximity to the many homeless in SD... I encountered no problems with this and both my wife and I felt perfectly safe walking about at night... Sure you will have some encounters but to be honest the homeless problem in downtown SD is so noticable that you would have issues with it regardless of where you stayed. The front desk and concierge were very helpful. As an example, they allowed us to borrow 2 bikes free of charge to take and cycle arounfdCoronado Island for the day. The gym and Yoga studio wereideal and allowed us both to get our morning workouts in before breakfast. Special mention for the lemon infused water that was freely available throughout the hotel and in the gym, seriously refreshing. The only downside, and its kinda a big one, was the acual size of the room. It was painfully small and by the end of the 6 nights it was becoming more and more of an issue. Don't get me wrong, they have made a great use of the space afforded to each room but that does not deflect from the fact that, even just with the 2 of us... it was cramped. In this regard, the aforementioned Gaslamp Plaza Suites rooms were far more appealing. All in all though, the Sofia is a modern, funky boutique hotel in a great location and SD itself, both downtown and out to the beach towns of Coronado and PB is a magificent place to go your holidays", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cUnique Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mrmets", "ReviewID": "UR88240827", "Content": "We stayed one night at this unique boutique hotel.

LOCATION : (Rating : EXCELLENT) Prior to our finally selecting this hotel, I had some misgivings about the \"homeless\" and security of both the area and this hotel from reading reviews and am glad we went with our gut feel and booked it anyway. It's definitely downtown making it very convenient to catch the local bus, train and trolley to most of the sights. About a block away is the Horton Plaza, which, if you went to San Diego to shop would be good (not us) , restaurant outlets and other shops. The most convenience to us, however, was the Ralph's Supermarket across Horton Plaza (or about 2-3 blocks from the Sofia). There was a 7-Eleven nearer the hotel but the price and selection was far better at Ralph's. There was a review that mentioned security of this area because of jail/bondsmen offices in the area but frankly, it was never an issue with me, considering I was mostly by myself for 3 days while my husband was attending a conference. As common sense dictates, awareness and care ought to be taken anywhere and everywhere. ACCOMMODATIONS : (Rating : ABOVE AVERAGE) For it's class and it's historic background, the Sofia is well beyond it's worth. Granted that the room is indeed cozy (small-ish) that having both my husband and I walking past each other by the bed and the entertainment center was a squeeze, still it packed in everything else we could ever ask for... a microwave, and refrigerator, which is not normally available in most hotel rooms but which definitely made our stay more worthwhile. And a \"MUST\" to our hotel choice always....a coffeemaker, which in the Sofia, is a definite perk with the Cuisineart coffee, which I have to admit was a first taste for me and I found them almost as good as Starbucks. The water pressure was never a problem. The only 2 negatives (which would have made my accommodation rating excellent) was one, the shower configuration. The glass enlosure was only half the shower stall that water was everywhere after a shower. Second, would be lack of soap dish by the counnter/wash area . The above-the-counter glass bowl/basin was aesthetically pleasing and trendy but once used, the handsoap just had no place to stay as it just kept sliiping into the bowl. On our first 3 days, we used a plastic bag to lay the handsoap on so as not to ruin the beautiful counter. Thankfully, on our 4th day, there was a Sofia coaster provided for by the cleaning lady that day. Of course, it was totally soaked before the night was over . Very simple remedy that I am sure the Sofia will look into and provide for for future guests. The linens and pillows were very comfortable . Our room was on the 4th floor, facing the Courthouse. Noise was not a problem, the A/C was simply divine as it was the 80s and 90s in the days we were there. The ice-machine was also in the 4th floor, another big convenience! Other-in-room amenities: Iron / ironing board Radio / Ipod dock (the added feature of the \"white noise\" option was great) Hairdryer Toiletries was excellent (soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and mouthwash) AMENITIES: (Rating: EXCELLENT for it's class) For clarification, my rating is based on those we have experienced and therefore, would not speak for The Currant\", the hotel's retaurant as we unfortunately, did not have the privilege of dining there. However, based on how it looked and how it was really packed most lunches and evenings we were there, it probably is notable, too. The other hotel amenities worth mentioning are the Ice-machines on designated floors, the business center, which was conveneiently located in the lobby, the bikes and helmets offered FREE for hotel guests from dusk and the walking tour on Sundays. SERVICE : (Rating : EXCELLENT) Special kudos to the Front Desk staff (check-in date was 10/30). As guests not only in the hotel but to city as well, it was quite refreshing to find hotel staff very amiable and not just work-driven to help out guests like us for directions and information. I would also like to make special mention of the housekeeping staff. SImply superb! A minor note, there was indeed an additional daily fee of about $ 2.97 (or thereabouts) for historical preserevation cost upon our check-out . Though, this was not really a problem nor was the cost, it indeed would be better if it is understood clearly on their website or added to costs if booked on other sites. Overall, it should not deter anyone from choosing this hotel.

The concierge was great at telling me all about the tourist places I could visit. The location is ideal, within walking distance of the Gaslamp district. There is also a train station just two blocks from the hotel, so you can take a train to Old Town and the downtown areas if you don't want to walk (although it was called a \"trolley\" which makes it sound kind of quaint and old-world-style; it was really just a light rail, and when I was on it at night there were certainly some strange characters on with me). The rooms are fantastic; yes they are smaller than some hotels I have stayed in because it's a historical building and rooms were smaller when it was built, but come on people, you're in San Diego! Why are you hanging out in your rooms anyway? People who are worried about the size of their rooms should get out and DO something instead of hanging around all day in a hotel. They also have the added bonus of a mini fridge and a microwave, so I was able to save the leftovers from my favorite California restaurant (Vince's Spaghetti) and eat them the next day. The parking was $30 a night, but it was the same for pretty much all the hotels I looked at in the downtown area, so it's not outrageously high here versus other places.

The valet men are more than nice but I feel bad for not tipping, but at $30 a day- we can't afford to every time we come in or out. Sometimes I feel like they stand there like where's my tip? Lol. They are very nice and run to you when u pull up to open your door, etc. The front desk greets you every time you walk by. I just wish we would have stayed else where personally. Somewhere with a little breathing room and somewhere not downtown. Oh yea, the bathrooms! Talk about TINY. The shower doesn't even have a door or curtain. When we get done showering, the floor is like a swimming pool. They only give u one towel a person each day so that kinda sucks trying to clean the floor up when you have limited towels! Also on a day like today, after going to the zoo- I would enjoy a shower this evening.

I booked this hotel at half the price and I feel that is what I got. I was there for a conference and decided that this hotel was suitable, since it was 4 blocks from the convention site. When I arrived at the airport I had to find another way to get to the Sofia (they provide no shuttle service). I checked into my room and the person who took care of me was very pleasant, but she forgot to return my credit card, my ID and didn't properly magnetize my room key. Which meant I had to make a double trip downstairs. She was nice enough to provide me with extra maps and directions. This doesn't really count as a negative toward this review. After I got into my room, I was surprised how big the bathroom was. But this might be due to the room being a corner room. The room was very clean, well decorated and comfortable. I had a small flat screen TV, with basic and some cable channels. The bathroom was stocked with towels and shampoo/soap. They had a working fridge with microwave and the bed was very comfy. The sheets were clean and the comforter was puffy and soft. I was really happy upon entering (the positive). Then I found out that internet was 9.95 a day, but it's free in the lobby. Which would explain why everyone was downstairs with their computers. Bummer. Considering my friends at the Best Western across the street had it in their room for FREE. My first night was pleasant , until 7am the next morning. You see, the Sofia is located next to the Greyhound station and because my room is located right next to the station, I could hear the buses coming and going at 7am! So if you want to sleep in late, tell them you DO NOT want to face the Greyhound station. Lucky for me, I had to get up by that time for the conference (the negative). The hotel is located really close to the Horton Mall, which is great if you forget anything! They also provide massages and yoga, which is great to relax in your hotel. It is also within walking distance from the Gaslamp district and the baseball stadium (the positive) So to wrap it up.. POSITIVE: room was clean and nicely decorated , service was nice, location was great! NEGATIVE: pay for internet in your room and loud greyhound buses next door.

Not wanting to spend $265/night, the Sofia was an excellent alternative at $99/night + taxes of about $15/night. I made my reservation through Expedia initially, but then kept checking for a cheaper rate, and when the hotel itself advertised a lower rate, I cancelled the Expedia reservation and made it through the hotel website. The hotel is a safe, easy 15 minute walk through the business district to the convention center area, and is a few blocks from dozens and dozens of restaurants in the gaslight district and near Balboa mall. (Check out 'Thai Time' a block or two away, near the mall entrance for delicious cheap eats). The room was teeny-weeny (maybe 325 sq feet) and you could really only get into bed from one side of the bed because the other side was blocked by an incongruously large easy chair for the tiny room. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean. There was no provision for a bath, and the shower stall had one of those nuovo half-doors leaving half the stall open. The floor didn't get that wet but it takes getting used to. On two days, the housekeeping folks forgot to refresh my coffee 'filters' but I was able to get them from the desk. Soundproofing was OK but I could clearly hear people talking as they walked by in the hall and could faintly hear other people in their rooms talking or watching TV There is free wireless internet in the lobby if you have your own laptop, or you can use any of the 3 hotel-owned PC's in the 'business center' off the lobby. They were almost always in use when I wanted to print out my boarding passes, and had to show up at a crazy hour to find one free. You can pay for wireless internet in your room. The exercise center is outstanding, with a variety of aerobic and anaerobic options. No pool. The building also houses the Greyhound terminal, and there were always a few homeless-looking people near the entrance of the hotel but I never felt threatened and no one ever panhandled me. The overall ambiance is that of a small European-style boutique hotel.

There was a desk and rolling swivel chair to do work or eat in the room. The bathroom area was narrow and had a sliding door, with a shower stall (no tub) and toilet. The sink was in a corner nook and was an old-fashioned basin built on a wooden platform with drawers underneath and space for towels. The bath towels were long (the longest I've encountered at a hotel) but not especially thick or luxurious. Soaps and shampoos were generously-sized and excellent quality.

The room was small but not as small as I expected after reading some of the reviews. It didn't feel cramped as it was designed well to accommodate everything. If a pocket door on the bathroom is a big deal to you then this probably isn't the type of hotel you'd like in the first place. And the view is pretty much non-existent (you just look at the building or the parking lot of you get a room in back) but if you want scenery, go outside. The bed was very comfortable and it was great having a fridge and microwave in the room. The hotel was very quiet and we were on the top floor so we never heard any street noise at all. The shower was kinda weird, I'll agree with other reviewers on that. There is no way to close it off so water will get on the floor. I laid a hand towel down to catch the water and it was fine. My only complaint would be that the drinking water in the lobby was WAY to lemony. It was like drinking lemonade with no sugar. You don't need to many lemons in there you guys!

When I found it online, I was a bit concerned I'd end up experiencing a boutique which was trying to be trendy and hip and not simply cozy and comfortable like I was hoping. Boy, were my slight concerns in this regard unwarranted, I am so happy to say. What I found out was that the staff, atmosphere, amenities and overall feel were outstanding and wonderful and make me want to go back soon! Let me share a few details and try to paint the picture as to why I liked it so much. There is much about which I'd like to elaborate, but I'll try to summarize as succienctly as I am able. Before I even committed to booking my room on the phone (and trust me, its worth it to do this rather than simply take the best rate you can find online), I found such helpfulness from the young lady named Amanda in explaining the rooms and rates available. She was so friendly and extremely patient with my many questions and attempts to find a way to reduce the rate just a bit more than what I found online. She was able to do so after I coaxed her just enough, but she never once made me feel I was keeping her too long. Next, on the night of my arrival, I was treated to such a wonderful welcome and very effecient service by Selma at the front desk. She made me feel I was being hosted by a friendly aquaintance, not just another hotel employee \"doing the job\" with here genuinely warm and friendly manner. She anticipated my needs and had helped me on the phone before arrival by reading off menu items from the Currant Restaurant on property and had my food prepared and waiting when I arrived to check in! This was her suggestion on the phone when she realized I was running late and might miss a late dinner when I mentioned I was hungry and figuring out options. She also assisted me with parking ideas and introduced me to the bellman Daniel, who was also extremely friendly and helpful while I ate before getting back to my vehicle to park it. During my stay, Autumn at the desk was also such a peach and a friendly assistant. She printed off directions to Coronado while I was gabbing away with Selma again and then the next day acted as my bellperson and check out host at the same time while the other bellman was at lunch. She was so cheeful, patient and an enjoyable person with whom to converse and I still can see her bright smile in my mind. Kudos to Christian the dest manager, too, as he was helpful, effiecient and friendly as well! If you have not already figured it out, the staff is perhaps my favorit thing about the hotel. But let me say a bit more about the facility itself. For the money you pay, which is reasonable already, you get a nice fitness center and useful computers and printer at the business center. The feeling all around hotel is clean, cozy and relaxed. The atmosphere is charming. The furnishings are contemporary and comfortable. I did like the room, although it was pretty small, but I knew that coming in and could have paid more for a larger suite. However, the room had everything you need including a small fridge, microwave, flat screen TV and even extra wine, beer and coffee glasses which were real glass, not plastic or cheap. The beds are divine - so very comfortable. The sleep cover and top sheet were a bit short for a queen bed in my opinion and at only 6' tall, my feet stuck out a bit. But the housekeeping staff gave me a king size the next day which helped. The one thing which was really strange about the room was the shower set up, which is common in many of the rooms. It has no door or curtain, so water goes all over the floor and toilet area, which makes a mess to dry up. However, I just asked for more towles and put them down the next time. I'd rather not have to do it, after falling in love with other aspects of the hotel I would put up with it again. Anyone looking to stay here must realize the benefits and challenges of the location. You are pretty centrally located downtown and other parts of the city are easily accessible by car or public transporation. It's in an area focused on business as much as tourism. However, there are nice restaurants nearby in the Gaslamp area and even just in the general blocks not far away. The food I had at the Currant restaurant in the hotel was pretty good, but I need to eat there more to give it a real review. I must say my waiter was very hard working and accomodated all of my detalied requests happily. But the biggest challenge downtown is parking. You either have to find a pay lot, run back and forth to meters in the daytime, or pay $28 for valet parking at the hotel. I was trying to save money for other activities, so I used a pay lot about 5 blocks away and had to go back and forth a few times to make sure I was not ticketed. But it was only $3-5 and mostly overnight, as I was out and doing things in the daytime. So, just know what you are getting into and then make your choice. I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm extremely happy with my stay overall. Perhaps I'd give it 4.5 if I could, only because I think it's only fair to point out the few small things I'd prefer were different like the shower set up and the parking costs/hassle. However, knowing those things going in now, I'd still stay there anytime.

I looked into how much it would have been to stay if we paid regular price and it was only $25-$40 more per night to stay at one of the hotels right in the Gaslamp. It was our first time to San Diego and we were pleasantly surprised to get door to door from the airport to the Sofia in just about 10 minutes. Unfortunately, as we came up the street we noticed the San Diego Court building a block and a half away, and the city jail one block away. We had a lovely view of two different bail bond locations next door from our room. That coupled with the bus station on the other side of the hotel and all of the people milling around outside made us too uncomfortable to walk anywhere from the hotel. We are from Chicago and used to city life, but this was pretty seedy. The doorman at the hotel was lovely and super helpful, as well as the front desk staff. The front desk man quickly offered us glasses of water and suggestions for the easiest way to get to the bars/restaurants we were going to that evening. The lobby however looked like the entryway to a cheap apartment building. It only got worse when we got to our room, it was TINY! I have stayed at hotels all over the country and this was smaller than rooms in New York City! Immediately when you walk in the sink is on your left and then to your right is a pocket door leading into a room with a toilet shoved against the poorest designed shower ever. The shower looks pretty before you get into it, but it is just a glass wall that partitions off half of the shower and when you shower water sprays out into the floor until it is soaking wet. We laid down towels to soak up some of the mess but I would imagine that people slip and fall all the time in this shower. The rest of the room was filled with way too much furniture, we had to lay out our suitcases on our bed and get out what we needed and then zip them back up since there was no where to do it on the floor or on a stand. Admittedly, I am sensitive about my bedding, but this bedding just wasn't fresh at all. The only redeeming quality were the very nice black out shades (not drapes) that covered the chicken wire covered windows. We didn't sleep well at all though because of our location to the jail there were constantly sirens throughout the night raging past our windows.

After researching and comparing prices we decided on the Sofia based on the many well written reviews, We just returned from our 4 day getaway to San DIego and have to say that the hotel was above average as far as style and customer service but lacked in other areas. My first impression of the hotel was a little disappointing due in part that we had arrived at 4:30 and the room was not ready, we were asked to leave our luggage and return in 30 minutes. No problem especially since we had requested a specific room which they were accomadating. Once in the deluxe queen room we were amazed at how small the deluxe room really was. Decor was nice, modern and very clean. I agree with other reviews the shower set-up is strange, only half a glass-door present so shower water land on floor, no tub in bathroom. Internet not free in room $10 a day. Location is next to greyhound and bus depot so there are homeless and transients just outside the hotel, albeit harmless. At night ambulance sirens can be heard all to frequently which made it difficult to sleep at times ( we were on the top floor and could still hear everything). Aside from those details you can walk around the downtown area, the mall, 5th avenue and even to ballpark easily. Bus and trolly are user friendly if you dont have a car. Dining at the Currant for lunch or dinner is a MUST, food is excellent and service is top notch. FYI- We decided not to drive largely in part because of the overnight parking fee of $26/day.

I read a review where someone complained about the weird SQUARE pillows and how it was so hard to sleep with those.

I got a perfect night's sleep each night of our stay. There is plenty of wardrobe/cupboard space to hang your clothes and other items. There is a desk with a lamp large enough to do any work that you may need to do. There is also a very comfy arm chair with matching ottoman. There are two lamps either side of the bed which can be dimmed and swivelled around to your required spot. There are two bedside tables. The bathroom is very clean and modern also. The sink sits outside of the bathroom itself. There is also a mini fridge and microwave. You are also supplied with a coffee maker and mugs and glasses. The only thing was there was no cutlery - we ate a few microwaved dinners to save some money so we had to buy some cheap cutlery so that we could eat it. BUSINESS CENTRE There is a well set up business centre in the lobby which has a sliding door which may be shut if necessary. There is a telephone for business calls as well as three computers and one printer. The computers were very reliable, but sometimes there was a bit of a wait because the hotel is primarily a business traveller's hotel. We did not eat at Currant (the hotel's restaurant) because it was quite pricey and a little intimidating. Again, this would suit the business travellers which seem to dominate the hotel's clientele. The staff were very professional. Housekeeping ladies were lovely. The hotel is charming and very cozy. Just sitting in the lobby was nice and relaxing - there is a fireplace and plenty of comfortable chairs. In terms of finding places to purchase groceries and toiletries near by - there is a Ralph's about two blocks behind (south) of Horton Plaza - it had everything you needed including beautiful premade salads and cold meats which made very nice, cheap and easy meals if you are tight on the budget. I would recommend going straight to ralphs as the small grocery store in Horton Plaza ( i think it is a long's pharmacy) doesnt have everything you need. There was also a discount grocery store on or just after 7th street on Broadway - we purchased lots of microwaveable soup bowls from there - made quick and easy snacks or meals - we also found our cheap cutlery and a few plastic containers to store left overs in - this place is great, but be aware that there are a few undesireables that hang out around it - maybe go there during the day. In terms of fast food near by - there are plenty of food outlets in Horton Plaza with a wide range of types of foods - there is also a pizza hut on the same block of the hotel - about 20 metres from the front of the hotel. Again, you are close to the bay - so go down and have some seafood at the many restaurants along the wharf. Also, seaside village is not far (about a 10 minute walk) - this has a few nice restaurants with varying styles and budgets. All in all, the sofia hotel was an excellent choice in san diego. If i went back to san diego, i would stay here again.

Don't be fooled. We had a teeny tiny room on the 6th floor (top level thankfully) but could hear the woman sneezing with our door closed in the room across the hall. I could hear the guy next to us reading his newspaper (turning the pages) and a woman REALLY enjoying herself on the other side of us. I had requested a corner room but no dice. This was the oddest hotel room I've ever been in. You walk into the room and immediately on your left is the sink. It is a cute sink but completely oversized for the room. The bathroom door slides out from the wall and would not stay closed. You basically had to keep an eye on it the entire time you were doing your business. Everyone else has commented on the shower so no need to elaborate there. The bed was comfy but the room so crammed with furniture that it felt claustrophobic. There was a chair on the other side of the bed that was pressing up against the wall and the bed - it was completely unneccessary. It just made the room feel smaller. We had a lovely view of the Greyhound parking lot and the gorgeous chicken wire in the window to keep the junkies and drunks of days past from jumping was a classy touch. My computer screen is about the same size as the TV. Unless you paid for a suite I wouldn't bother at all with this place, and if you are staying here remember to pack your white noise machine because you are going to need it. Despite the fact that there is a restaurant downstairs, there is no room service and you can't take their glassware up into your room. It just gives a \"lack of cooperation\" attitude that is unimpressive at best. I only had some fries and a ten-dollar bottle of sparkling water (that is the only choice I had for sparkling). The BF had a very lousy omlette from what I was told. Since I live here in SD, I knew about the location and had been to Currant before for drinks. I didn't mind the walk down to the Gaslamp and the East Village for entertainment and frankly, I was thankful for the time to have escaped from our chicken coop of a room. There is no way in hell I would have stayed 2 nights unless I knew that I was paying rock bottom prices (from an Expedia sale). If I was on vacation or paying a higher rate I would have checked out early for sure and rebooked elsewhere. The plus side is that it made my apartment feel HUGE by comparison.

As you may have read already, the Sofia Hotel is a boutique-style hotel, and the rooms tend to be on the smaller size. No problem for us! I loved our room.

There is no door so water spilt out of the shower--despite our best efforts to not make such a huge splash while we showered. Be sure to have plenty of towels available. It's really no big deal; we're very easy-going people and the lack of a shower door was not grounds to despise the hotel--though some people with very discerning tastes may believe otherwise.

The accommodations are much better than expected for such an old building. I\u2019ve stayed in old hotels before, but this one has been very well updated and the space is used very efficiently. The room had a beautiful basin sink, a very modern-looking shower, a flat-screen television, mini-fridge and microwave. The fridge and microwave were very nice touches. The furnishings all fit the room very nicely. My only complaints are with the bedside lamps which were difficult to switch off and on and the functionality of the shower. As I mentioned above, the design of the interesting shower stall with no door and a half sheet of glass is visually appealing, but it functioned very poorly in keeping water in the shower and not all over the bathroom floor. Form was definitely placed over function when designing this. The addition of disposable cups would have been a nice touch too. The issue of the shower really didn\u2019t take much away from the full experience though. The staff was very helpful and friendly and everything else was great. The restaurant looked very nice, but we unfortunately did not have a chance to sample the fare. We also did not drive to the hotel but parking is valet only. The location was decent. It\u2019s nicely located just far enough away from the Gaslamp District itself to be relatively quiet, but close enough walking distance to both Gaslamp and the Horton Plaza mall. Pizza Hut Express, Wendy\u2019s, Sushi Deli 2, and 7-Eleven are just a stone-throw away. The biggest negative of the location is the Greyhound bus station on the lobby level of the building.

I'm not going to lie and say that there weren't homeless people around, we did see 3/4 when it got later but they didn't bother or hassle us and i never felt threatened or unsafe walking around the area. Best bits: The receptionist who checked us in was amazing...so helpful with maps and tips on what to do in the city/where to eat/what to see etc. I just feel so ashamed that i can't remember his name. But he was a great help and it set our few days at the hotel on the right foot as he couldn't have done any more for us.

Nice look, friendly and helpful staff and free business center Internet computers. But there are so many problems that I just can't recommend it - even to my worst enemy! First, the rooms are VERY small. The average hotel room is 350 to 550 sq. ft. This hotel's queen rooms are only 207 sq. ft. so everything is tight. For example, their towels are longer than either the length or width of the bathroom. The bed is comfortable and the toiletries are very nice, but most everything else doesn't make it. The lighting is limited, you can't go to the bathroom at night without waking your spouse because of the fan noise, there is no shower door (probably because there is no room in the bathroom to open a door) or even a regular bathroom door. After the third time that the air conditioning noise and blast of air directly on the bed woke me, I tried to find a place in the room to escape its effect, but couldn't. I finally went down to the somewhat spacious lobby for the rest of the night to escape this claustrophic room. (Maintenance came twice to try to fix the A/C, but it was still very uncomfortable). They took an older building and did a valient effort to make it into a boutique hotel - but, ultimately, they failed. The very small room size plus some implementation failures make this a place that I just can't recommend even if the price was attractive. (It reminds me of the closeness of being in an MRI machine). We went to the coffee shop just outside the hotel and it was very nice and a good value. We did not walk around the neighborhood, so can't react to the reports of it being a marginal area. There were a large group of us staying here, and discussions with six others indicated that they have the same negative view of their stay.

The extra towels were necessary because the stand-up shower has a glass retaining wall for half its length and no door, so it splashes out quite a bit. The hotel was pretty quiet and we only heard our neighbors when they were opening and closing their closet. The halls are all pointed out from the building, so many rooms have windows facing rooms in the next hallway. We were disappointed at this set-up at first, but they put us the room closest to the elevator and stairs, which was ideal for taking the dog out to do her business. About a block south is a lawn to the federal building that even has a poop-bag dispenser (although it was empty during our visit). The hotel is next to a mall that is dog-friendly and a short drive from Balboa Park, where there is an off-leash fenced park. The restaurant in the hotel was pretty pricey ($15-20 for breakfast before beverages), but looked nice. There is also a Coffee Bean attached and an organic caterer that serves breakfast M-F across the street.

THE LOCATION - While the immediate neighborhood can have some sketchy characters (it's next to a bunch of bail bond shops and a Greyhound station), it's literally a couple of blocks from the Gaslamp, and never really felt unsafe. THE ROOM - The rooms are very clean and well decorated in a very attractive modern, but not overly flashy style (the photos they post are very accurate). We got a corner room with a nice view out of two of the windows, so the room felt a bit bigger than it might have otherwise. THE BUILDING - I think the Sofia might be a historical hotel, and it definitely does have more character than most of the Gaslamp hotels I've seen. Almost like an upscale NYC brownstone. THE BED - It's a good pillowtop bed with two duvets and nice, clean white sheets. It's no W heavenly bed, but it's comfortable. THE STAFF - Very helpful, professional desk staff. Not \"warm,\" but on top of their game. THE BAD: THE WEBSITE - This is partly my fault, but I didn't realize until the day of our trip that the Sofia never sent me an email confirmation. We called and they did have the reservation, but this turned out to be a problem for the next reason. THE SURPRISE PRICE GOUGE - When we checked out, we noticed that our rate was $20 higher per night than quoted on their site. It wasn't taxes or fees... it was just $20 higher. Unfortunately we had no print out to prove it had gone up. If you book a room with them, make sure you print out the confirmation page and take it with you... it's the only time I've ever had this happen at a hotel and I've stayed at a LOT of hotels, both chain and independent. THE SOUND - The Sofia's walls are pretty thin, and in the morning, we were awakened at around 6 am by water in the pipes, doors shutting and people talking. THE WINDOWS - Don't open, which was surprising given the character of the hotel. We had to keep the A/C running all night just to eliminate the stuffiness.

But, I realize that different travelers have different needs and expectations. So here goes: My husband and I (early 30s and extensive travelers) stayed at the Sofia over Memorial Day weekend. We took the bus from the airport, 992 ($2.50 pp--exact change) and arrived at the Sofia within 15 mins of the airport. The Sofia's location is unbeatable. We were without a car for the trip, and it was totally fine. We walked to Balboa Park, the Embarcadero, Little Italy, and the eateries in the downtown/gas lamp area. We are very active and the walks didn't bother us one bit, but if you don't want longer walks, the bus stops right in front of the hotel. The hotel itself--perfect, boutique hotel. If you are used to chain hotels with huge rooms, this may not be it for you. If you like ornate features and if mileu matters to you, this could be the place for you. We had a standard room, which came with wonderful linens and a down comforter/duvet, and the bed was amazing--we have never enjoyed a hotel bed more than our own! The room had a flat-screen tv, small refrigerator, microwave, closet for hanging clothes and a small sitting area. The bathroom was also lovely, we liked the separate shower/toliet area from the sink...and I admit to being a bit snobbish about the toiletries, but these provided were really good quality. I could actually comb through my long hair after using their conditioner. The workout room was also well equipped with individual tv on each treadmill, weights and other equipment. I used the yoga studio 3x and I was the only person in there 2 out of 3 times. It was really peaceful and had a great set up. The hotel also offers bottled water, which is great. The service was also quite good and we didn't have any issues. However, I would suggest doing your own research at their internet area downstairs if planning to rent a car at last minute or doing an activity of some sort...not sure that the staff is up-to-date on pricing.

The pluses for me were: - A lovely room for a great price: I booked one of the larger suites and was glad I did - using the fire exit map for scale, I figured out how small the regular rooms were and I would have gone stir-crazy, even as someone who is more than used to small European hotel rooms. The room itself was quite nicely decorated - chic but comfortable. The room rate was a great deal, especially as a large convention was in town and rooms were going for $300+/night at other nearby spots - I saw a great price for a Sofia suite on a 3rd party site and the hotel matched their rate for me. - A nice hotel in a decent location: The Sofia has been beautifully decorated - it maintains some of the charm of the original heritage building but with many modern conveniences. The location is convenient to the convention centre and Gaslamp District, and it's a short bus ride up in Balboa Park (the bus stops right outside the door). - The gym: Amazing gym! Top of the line cardio equipment (small personal tv screens with a headphone jack and a fan on each cardio machine) endless towels and bottled water, and not busy at all! The minuses? - Staff were hit or miss - the guys manning the bell stand were super friendly, but the girls behind the front desk were a little harried and came across a bit frosty. The housekeepers were all over the map - sometimes an obvious piece of trash would not be picked up or amenities would not be replenished, but other times everything was perfect. - No storage space - there was a very tiny closet in my room, with not enough room to stash my suitcase in, and the storage issue seems to extend to the housekeeping staff too - their carts would be parked in the halls for nearly whole days at a time. - The bus depot - the Greyhound depot is right behind the hotel and there can be some noise and characters hanging around at night. As a woman traveling alone, though, I never felt threatened - although the depot brings a few odd folks with it, it also means there are always taxis out front and people milling about at all hours. - Noise in general - if you're facing the rear of the building, you get bus depot noise; if you're facing the front, you get the random drunks coming out of the Gaslamp District late at night and the odd siren. As a city-dweller, I found the traffic and sirens to be fine but the random drunk yells to be really annoying. On top of that, the hotel's HVAC system is rather rattly so while having the a/c on drowns out city noise, it brings its own set of noises with it. - Quite possibly haunted - the room just felt spooky, period. I'm sure it's just wiring issues that go along with an old hotel, but lights would randomly go on in the room, stay on for an hour or so, then turn off just as mysteriously as they had turned on. I was charging my phone one night and from across the room, saw it light up as if someone had pushed a button yet I was the only one in the room. Overall, it was a decent stay and if looking for a cheaper option convenient to the downtown area, I'd go with the Sofia again. I'd bring earplugs and my husband, but I'd go again. if money was no object, though, I'd go back to the US Grant a couple blocks down the street.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, some problems\u201d", "Author": "eckythump", "ReviewID": "UR14971656", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights in November 2007.

The room is tastefully decorated, the bed is very comfortable (didn't like the small pillows however), good selection of cable channels. The bathroom is very small, the sink is directly to the left as you walk in, and the shower has no screen so water tends to go all over the place, but that's what housekeeping is for. While the room itself was very nice, the hotel suffers from paper thin walls. We had loud drunken people in the next room to us who laughed and talked very loudly until very late (they finally quietened down by 2-3am). We could even hear when our neighbours turned their lights on and off. The other 2 nights we were fortunate to not have noisy people next door, but it really is just pot luck who you get. We are returning to San Diego in May and will be choosing another hotel to stay in due to the noise issue.

The hotel has been nicely refurbished and they seem interested in providing the little touches that might qualify the place as as boutique hotel.

Flat screen tv, microwave, mini fridge, safe and coffee maker. We were on the second floor and the view was the main disappointment. A roof from a lower building extended just below our window (see pictures) and those windows were covered with a metal mesh (security, I assume). I pulled down the shades and blocked that view, but naturally it made for a darker room. So, ask for a room higher up to avoid this. Higher rooms might also get you away from the street noise, as the hotel is located on a busy intersection. We live in a city, so it didn't wake us up but I can see how it might bother others. Internet access: Wifi in the lobby but ethernet connections ($10) in the room. Staff: Everyone was helpful, especially the concierge who recommended several nearby restaurants. Location: As noted by the other reviewers, the location is great and not-so great. Located in the heart of downtown, it is just a few short bocks to the Gas Lamp district, full of restaurants and shopping. But, it is also next to Greyhound, a bail bond shop and the San Diego County Jail on the next block. So, if you are used to staying in urban areas, you probably won't blink an eye. If not, it might make an impression. All told, walking around with my husband, I did feel safe at night. Parking: We parked our car with the valet, who was really friendly.

We booked the Sofia. $99 per night for a room with one or two queen beds, $149 per night for a suite. The rooms are very small, so the suite worked best for those who were sharing. Good value . What we liked: front desk staff: very nice and accomodating amenities: great linens and free bottled water, microwaves, fridge and coffee maker in room (7/11 nearby)free internet in lobby and three computers plus a printer for guest use beds: VERY nice, quite comfortable Rooms are as noted very compact. They are well decorated and efficiently planned. The curtains are heavy and I was never disturbed by street noise (room 304) Common areas are well decorated and make great conversation areas (despite the Christmas decor which is still up...a little wierd but tasteful) Walking tour offered for free on Sat and Sunday morning. Excellent, just over an hour touring the Gaslamp district, Embarcadero and waterfront. Very well done. Location: It was very easy to walk to shops , restaurants, and clubs. Train and trolley very near by. Taxis always at the stand. On site restaurant, Currant, and the bar: Loved this. The bar is very attractive, albeit rather noisy when the Charger fans are in high gear. Good happy hour. The dinner at the restaurant was excellent. We had the breakfast buffet every morning. Good strong coffee, house made pastries of extremely high quality, fresh berries, melon and pineapple, house made granola and french toast, and yogurt for $9.99. Perfect for us. Restaurant staff is very good, well informed, courteous and helpful. What we didn't like: Housekeeping, capricious at best. Some days they came, some days they didn't. I left most mornings by 7 and twice returned to change for dinner around 6 and the room had not been cleaned. Several of our group had delayed checkin and two were checked into rooms which had not been cleaned. (there are some management issues at the hotel, staff communication is not good. Checkout was slow for several people.) Bathrooms: nearly all of us commented on this. They don't have a complete shower closure, a half wall of glass in the European style which yielded a wet (as in soaking) floor after showers The bathroom door is a sliding glass (frosted) door which never fully shuts. Not a good thing in a shared room. No exhaust fan. The sink is on a stand outside the bathroom and is sloped so that if the water comes on a bit fast it will slosh all over the floor. The best thing about the hotel is the very pleasant and accomodating front desk, in particular, Brian. The worst thing about the hotel is housekeeping. Although the rooms were well cleaned, the problem was they were slow and not consistent. Also small maintenance issues which housekeeping should note and have resolved before check in of the next guest weren't addressed.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Sofia\u201d", "Author": "rdrgrl724", "ReviewID": "UR12454627", "Content": "Stayed at the Sofia for one night on New Year's Eve.

There is a small amount of public parking in the area but we used the valet ($25). The room was such a great price that even with valet it was a better deal than most hotels we looked at.

I stayed at this hotel while attending a major conference in early Nov 2007. Although I made the reservations for the hotel months in advance, when I arrived there was a possibility that I would not have a room, as the hotel was so overbooked. (For me, this was not unexpected, as this is a common occurrence with hotels when serving patrons for this particular conference.) The staff members were very apologetic for this trouble, and after some time, my reservation was found, and I was placed in a very VERY small, but well decorated, room. I originally planned to share my room with a colleague, but with the severe lack of space, and the fact that the bathroom door (which was in view from all points in the very small room) consisted of opaque glass, these plans had to be changed. Like the room, the bathroom was also very small, and was designed such that when one stepped out of the shower one was stepping in front of the bathroom door. As my colleague and I had no interest in seeing each other naked from the other side of the glass door, my colleague chose to find other arrangements. This left me to pay for the room ($175/night) by myself. Notably, the room would be fine for couples, but it was simply not possible to share this room with a friend. I also noticed that many other rooms in this hotel appeared to be much larger than the one we were placed in, so this may have been just the luck of the draw. But we had asked for a 2 person room, so it's possible that others may have a similar experience. If you are concerned about this, I would ask in advance about rooms for 2 people that would be suitable for non-couples. The restaurant associated with the hotel was good and very well decorated, but expensive. For example consider the breakfast options: $10 for your choice of plain yogurt, granola, fruit, muffins, and coffee; $17 if you want eggs and toast with that. Luckily I am a light eater, and so the first option more than met my needs. It was convenient that the hotel offers wireless access in the lobby, as well as 3 computers with internet access (and possibly a printer) to its patrons.

Therefore, we asked for the room on the top floor - 7th and were pleasantly suprised that the noise is subtle. The room itself is very small, but everything is smartly planned. The only problem that we experienced was the noise coming from the air conditioner. I asked the receptionist to see if we can check other rooms, but the noise is the same is other rooms as well. So, we did not change anything. The personnel is very pleasant and is willing to assist. The location of the hotel is great: walking distance to the center of the city, sea port (15-20 mins), mall, and bunch of restaurants. For the tourists, I recommend to take the bus tour: Hop on Hop off and to check online for the discounts possible before you buy it through the hotel itself. The bus stops 5 mins away from the hotel and its a great way to see the whole city. Also, recommend to take the ferry boat to go to the Coronada Island. The prices are though pretty high for the area and if you get a car and drive a bit, you can get better deals. for restaurants.

Whatever the employees are eating or drinking, they need to export it to other hotels. Another positive is the location - close to horton plaza, the gaslamp district, and one block or so away from the train station, right in the heart of downtown. The rooms are tastefully modern and well decorated, and they make the most out of the smaller rooms. The negatives would be the lack of self parking - paying $25 a day for valet parking (plus tip) is steep, even if the hotel is downtown. The rooms also were small, as mentioned, and the air conditioning seemed to only work after a few hours. The windows had paint on them and would not open - not that the view of the greyhound bus station was anything to stare at anyway.

We took our dog, and it was important for it to be quiet, since our dog barks at any noise and keeps us up at night if there is a lot of noise around. She didn't do that, and we slept well. The rooms are small, but it's an old hotel and you have to understand that they've kept the integrity of the old building and made their rooms comfortable. The shower was a little weird, but it didn't ruin our stay. We just didn't blast the water. The bathroom was very nice. Nice tile, colors, and feel. Our room had its own refrigerator and microwave, that made it easy for us to have a cup of tea in the morning. The gym was excellent for its size. The Eliptical Trainers and the Treadmills were all modern, with built-in fans and televisions. The gym had clean towels available, and bottled water. The staff left bottles of water in the room, also, so we had fresh water most of our stay. Next door was a \"yoga\" room, which we used to stretch. The one pain was relying on the valet service. Although they were efficient, it's a bit of a problem to always have to wait for your car. And the hotel charges a daily rate, but they don't tell you that the valet service isn't connected to the hotel. So on top of the rate, you feel compelled to tip, which makes it a rip-off. If we're paying $25 a day, you'd think the tip would be included. Especially if you are \"required\" to use the service. I guess we could have shopped around, but we were looking for convenience. The valet staff did leave us with a reminder scratch on one of the sides of our car. Overall, a nice experience.

I only have two complaints about the room, it was tiny - smaller than a NY hotel and the shower is \"modern\" with only half of a door.

This cute little boutique hotel has only been open for about 3 months, so there are still various bugs to be worked out. First: When we arrived to check in, someone had mistakenly cancelled our reservation. The young, nervous employee working at the front desk was polite and quickly attempted to remedy the error. We had booked a King room, and apparently he was having trouble finding us an available KIng, and asked if we would mind a Queen. I politely said no, that we really preferred a King, and he continued to look in the computer. Then he said \"I will try and upgrade you to a suite.\" Of course I assumed that he meant that the only KIng beds available were in suites, and that he was going to upgrade us as a gesture of goodwill to make up for the hotel's error. I thanked him for his help, went up to my suite, and found...a Queen bed. When we called down, we were told, \"Oh no, all suites have Queen beds.\" Grrrrr. Staff here is friendly but generally immature. One gets the feeling that they had to staff this brand new hotel quickly, and filled all the openings with young, inexperienced kids. Nice, friendly, polite, but ineffective. The other major problem, (which may not be a problem for some), was that the room had vents in the ceiling through which came a constant loud sound of air/machinery/water running...? A constant humming, like louder-than-normal \"white noise.\" After some investigation we learned that all the rooms have this noise, and apparently lots of people don't even notice it. SO if you are the sort of person who likes white noise when falling asleep, this probably won't bother you. For us, it felt like trying to sleep in a comfy (albeit Queen) bed on a 747. On the positive side: Good location, cute, clean rooms, nice toiletry products, nice soft linens, excellent hairdryer, flat screen TVs, no street noise (probably because of super-loud white noise!) Probably would not stay here again. Maybe in a few years, when it \"grows up\" a bit.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cSofia...Not as Good as it Could Be...\u201d", "Author": "vmsPhiladelphia", "ReviewID": "UR7434937", "Content": "Visited The Sofia in April 2007- The Good: 1) Lovely contemporary appearance, spa like environment, 2) convenient location (close to airport and all downtown sites such as Gaslamp, Balboa, Seaport, Old Towne...these are all an easy walk or quick bus/trolley ride). 3)Lobby area is very comfortable with a fireplace, plasma TV and very comfortable seating. 4) Common area with three computers for internet access in addition to the rooms. This also allows wireless access so you can use your own computer. 5)Housekeeping is very efficient, you don't often see their carts crowding the halls and they didn't seem to arrive at inconvenient times. The Bad: 1) VERY NOISEY! Regardless of which side or end of the building you are on, the noise makes it difficult to sleep. If you are on the back side of the building, you overlook a bus terminal. We had one of these rooms for 2 nights. You hear buses idling and squealing brakes all night long. Don't believe the people at the front desk when they tell you the buses aren't allowed to idle... they do. In addition, there are some commercial buildlings adjacent to the bus terminal...a trash truck arrives between 6:30-7:15 am to empty the 4-5 large dumpsters (skips). Not only do you have to listen to the back-up beeping (beep, beep, beep, beep...) you have to listen to the sound of the metal dumpsters being moved around, clamped in, placed back on the ground and rolled back into place. Over and over. It seemed like the process took 2 hours...it was probably more like 30 minutes. Also, there is a police station in the back area so every time a call came in (surprisingly many), you have to listen to blasting police and fire-rescue sirens. Ok, so after the second sleepless night, we asked to be moved to a quieter room. We were moved to the street side (Broadway). This is a major multi-lane street with non-stop traffic. Our third night was also sleepless. On our 4th night we discovered the alarm clock had background noise like rain, water, animals...we used this to block the street noise. Rain is the best for this. 2) No room service of any kind and the only place to get something convenient is Wendy's, a coffee shop that closes rather early or 7-eleven. That's about it. They have a sign showing a new restaurant opening Spring 2007...Current...a Scandinavian style place but it didn't seem to be too far along. 3) The gym in \"hidden\". 4) Many, but not all, of the front desk staff are very arrogant. Upon check-in, 9:30 pm on a Saturday night we inquired about a place to eat. We advised them we would like non-smoking (we forget Cali. is non-smoking). The person checking us in looked up with a sneer and said, \"We totally hate disgusting smokers!\" Now, I am not a smoker and I don't appreciate smoke in any way and avoid going any place that allows smoking but his attitude was very nasty. On our 4th night, we were watching TV at about 10:00 pm and someone attempted to enter our room...over and over...I peeped through the peep hole and saw people with a passkey that was obviously working but being blocked by the deadbolt angrily trying to force their way in. I advised them they had the wrong room and sent them back to the front desk. I called the front desk immediately and informed them of the situation. The young lady told me she would correct the problem Ten minutes later our phone rang and she started giving me the third degree about what I was doing in the room etc. I told her the story about switching rooms after the second night. She told me in a very terse tone, \"I plan to investigate this!\" and hung up. A few minutes later she called again and I once again explained the room switch and reminded her that we were in this room for two days. She cut me off and told me she would call me right back. I waited about 15 minutes and called her. She cut me off again and said, \"I told you, I'm investigating this.\" Thirty minutes later a gentleman called and once again asked me to explain the situation. At this point I was very frustrated and was a little short with him. He hung up. A few minutes he called back and told us he figured out what happened so the problem was resolved...he just hung up. No explanation, no apology...just hung up. 5) As others have said, the rooms are very small. There isn't any room to walk around or spread out. However, if you are single or a couple without children and don't really hang-out in your room, it isn't a problem. 6) The bathrooms are tiny. When you walk into your hotel room, you are immediately next to the bathroom sink...it is not in the actual bathroom. In an area the size of a closet you will find the toilet and very small shower with a 1/2 glass wall...horizontal not vertical. The floor is soaked after every shower regardless of how careful you are. We are small people but the amount of water on the floor looked like ducks were bathing in the room. To sum it up, if the hotel spent some money sound proofing the place ...(new window are a good start; still have the ancient windows with single pane glass), I would definitely stay there again despite the size and lack and lack of some \"luxuries\". The constant noise just makes it unpleasant. You feel exhausted by the end of your stay. Oh, by the way, if you haven't been to San Diego, be prepared for an onslaught of homelessness all around the hotel. You can barely take a step without tripping over someone sleeping on the street outside the hotel or nearby businesses.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cWow - what a Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "WearyWorkTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR7430329", "Content": "Expensive (I was there during a couple of trade shows) - but well worth it.
