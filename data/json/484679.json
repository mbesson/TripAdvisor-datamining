To our surprise, we found ourselves installed in a spacious suite, with a full kitchen, a rooftop balcony and a view overlooking the city. Outside the heavy double doors of the hotel lay a narrow, cobbled street with a wine seller, produce stand, butcher shop and a grocery store, among other amenities. It was almost possible to believe that we had been transformed into residents of Venice. Lanes led away in various directions to sightseeing attractions and to the Venice Bienalle. The owner was gracious and so hospitable that, on our last morning, she got up very early to make sure that the water taxi came for us. Bravissimo!

The Palazzo exudes old gothic Venice, and the neighborhood is so charmingly local Venice and far far from the crowds. We stayed in the Sant'Angelo Room with a vaulted ceiling, terrazo floor and period furnishings, and with 2 balconies overlooking the San Francesco della Vigna Campanille and the canal nearby. All the staff (Cristina, Valentina, Ivan, Enrico) are impeccably professional. They accommodated our crazy arrival-departure schedules and our demanding dinner reservation requests so winningly. While it is not San Marco-central, we rather preferred coming \"home\" to the peace and quiet that this location offered, after spending a day inevitably milling about with the crowd. Yet, it is really only about a 10-15 minute leisurely walk away to major city attractions (Piazza, Rialto, San Polo etc.). Its location is especially convenient for Biennale venues (Arsenale is only about 5-10 minutes away and Giardini just a bit more.) I highly recommend this lovely jewel of a guesthouse in the heart of old Venice.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cNice, but a few problems\u201d", "Author": "accaol", "ReviewID": "UR7790802", "Content": "This is a great place to stay if you have been to Venice a few times and want to feel like you live there. If you have never been before and want to see all the sites, you will be doing a lot of walking from this palazzo. It really is a bit out of the way of most of the tourist sites. Again, that might be a good thing... Now, to the palazzo itself...the common areas are amazing. The room itself was not. We stayed in the la Grazia suite which needed plaster and paint. The 1970's era kitchen was a bit tired and not adequately appointed. When you turned on the lights with the dropped ceiling, you saw all the bugs and debris that fell from the original ceiling. This situation exists in the dropped ceiling between the two bedrooms. Needless to say, we left these lights off. The bathroom was nice and modern, but here too they had holes or gaps around the fixtures that made you wonder what was inside the walls. They could have fixed this with a few minutes of spackle and some paint...but they didn't. The staff was first rate and informative. No problems here. This could be a real nice 4 or 5 star place with just a little bit of work. I hope the owners read this and address these problems. Now, we love modern furniture. But it just doesn't look right in this type of room. They should get rid of the silly modern table and chairs and put in some reproduction guest friendly pieces that look like they belong. PS. They also promised me a welcome basket upon my arrival. It never came. There is a market across the street and several a short walk away so that is nice too.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for a party!\u201d", "Author": "Val_and_David", "ReviewID": "UR7190276", "Content": "We stayed at the Palazzo Contorini for 3 days and for a friend's 60th birthday party which was held in the grand lounge. It was perfect! Private caterers provided a 4 course candlelit dinner with pre-dinner drinks and canapes for 24. It was the perfect location for the event, and our hostess says that the manager, Christina, just couldn't have been more helpful with arrangements. We did have a request to keep the noise down at 4am(!) but hey, the Palazzo is in a very quiet residential area (great resaurants at reasonable prices) so not surprising! A lovely area to stay in, 10 mins from both San Marco and the nearest vaporetto stop (Celestia). MUCH better than a hotel, but with the same level of service (very freindly and unobtrusive) , more economical and breakfast was included. We will visit Venice again and this will be my top choice for accommodation.", "Date": "March 19, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Palazzo Contarini della Porta di Ferro", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d484679-Reviews-Palazzo_Contarini_della_Porta_di_Ferro-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$185 - $508*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Castello 2926</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30122</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "484679", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c6/08/c608832afef39b87bd6c4294f8f1fa0230large.jpg"}}
