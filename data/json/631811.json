The bottom line for this hotel is: don't stay there if you are looking for \"airport\" hotel. They don't have shuttle service. You can't go to there by any other public transportation (you either will not be able to find public transportation to the city center \u2013 if you have couple of hours free), and the Madrid taxi drivers just rip you off (22\u20ac for 5 Min ride) Unlike most of the other hotels in the area, they charge you for the internet (3.95\u20ac per hour or 10.8\u20ac per day). The rooms are OK (nothing special for this level) and the service was also OK, but due to all the other weaknesses mention above (and in the previous reviews), I will not stay there again and I will not recommend to anyone who is looking for \"airport hotel\" in Madrid to stay at this hotel.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Location": "1", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ypsilanti, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cTerrible location, not at airport\u201d", "Author": "umichdave", "ReviewID": "UR138732755", "Content": "We were booked to stay at this \"airport\" hotel on the night before flying back to the United States. We arrived back at the Madrid airport from Sevilla, only to learn that there was no hotel shuttle. Furthermore, the trains take longer to get to this hotel than other Holiday Inn hotels in the city because of the routes that are necessary (the trains are not direct from the airport at all). We ended up eating the cost of this hotel (the room we selected was pre-paid and non-refundable) and staying at the excellent, closer by train, and near more interesting entertainment, Hotel Pyramides by Holiday Inn. To take a taxi to this \"airport\" hotel, as others have mentioned, is disproportionately expensive. The fact that this \"airport\" hotel has no shuttle is just inexcusable. It is not walkable, either. As a Platinum Priority Club member who is generally very satisfied with properties in the Holiday Inn chain, I find all of this unbelievable. I would recommend staying at another one of the Holiday Inn properties in the city, or if you must stay near the airport, select a different property than this one.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochdale, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cToo far from the airport\u201d", "Author": "tonyenglish", "ReviewID": "UR138643905", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel last night and its not good.

We changed rooms twice before settling in to a third. The first room had not been cleaned since the last guests and the second room was hot-box that faces the sun... The AC system was just not up for the 40 Celsius temps... 3. Ice machine downstairs... No ice buckets to be found. We ended up using the electic kettle. 4.

There was NO third iron! 5. We had two rooms... The remote control was broken in one room and the telephone was broken in another. We arrived about 3pm on a Friday...

It turned out to be one of the biggest mistakes we made on our Spain trip. The front desk staff (despite changing shifts three times) was consistently unfriendly and in some cases, downright rude. The cost for a double room was 69 euros which includes a mediocre breakfast. Breakfast is served starting at 7 A.M. which is helpful if you have an early flight. There is no wifi at all in this hotel unless you pay for it. They claim to have a \"business center\" but it is basically some computers and a printer in the restaurant and it is not free (as it is in all of the other HIE we have patronized in the U.S.) Despite it's name, this hotel isn't close to the International Terminal. We assumed that it would have an airport shuttle but it didn't and it ended up costing us 23 euros to get to the Airport. The Crown Plaza next door, which is part of the Holiday Inn group of hotels, does have a free airport shuttle, but you may only use it if you are staying there not at the HIE. The room has air conditioning which you will need to use to block out the traffic noise. There was something in the ventilation system here which caused both of us to cough whenever we were in the room (this stopped as soon as we left the hotel). The carpets throughout the hotel are stained and the hallways are dark. There is very little lighting in the room and the reading lights are terrible. Once you arrive at the hotel, the only places to eat are at the hotel restaurant which has a very limited selection of items or at the Crown Plaza next door. Getting back into Madrid requires an expensive taxi ride or using the metro, which is a challenge if you don't speak Spanish. You must walk about 1/2 mile down Avenida de Aragon to the bus stop. From there, you will need to cross over the freeway and wait for the bus on the other side. It is 2 euros to take the bus to the Metro and takes approximately 10 minutes. On the return ride, the bus will drop you off on the same side of the freeway as the Holiday Inn Express (another 2 euros for the return trip).

We got what we wanted, a double bed with a sofa bed. This was great as we were visiting all day. LOCATION: By the highway ...get a good map it's hard to get to it as the exit on the mao is closed so need to go by the hotel on the highway and take the next exit. New hotel and others beeing built around so seem in the middle of no where. Little hard to get in and out of there the first time if you are not from there. GET TO TOWN: We had a car to get to town and paid the underground parkings as it was easier. There was a shuttle available to the airport as we saw it every morning and everynight, so for those that need it...can't say if it was on time but it was arriving and departing from the hotel for sure. THE STAFF: The staff was very pleasant and helpful even if busy at times. They gave us maps and explained places to see and where to eat. CLEAN ROOM: Room was clean and looks like all the Express by holiday inn hotels. No fridge, no safebox. There was a kettle and coffee envelopes. Good beds, little hard, but better that than a broken mattress. Sofa-bed was thin but teenagers can sleep anywhere : ) BATHROOM: Marble counter top in bathroom and NO anti-slip in the tub...BE EXTRA CAREFUL. They are all made the same ..easy to slip and hit your head on the counter-top behind you. BREAKFAST: Complementary breakfast was good but get up early as all the little families go in Holiday inns so.... the food goes fast. It is mostly croissants, toasts, cereales, yogourts and of course coffee....when the machine works. It is a self serve machine just like in hospitals or offices. There is no american type coffees...I use to click twice the expresso button and pour milk in it. OTHERS SERVICES: Internet 1 hr for 4 euros or about, a tiny bar to have a drink next to the reception. No restaurant in hotel, no pool. PARKING: 12 euros a night, but as there is nothing around outside...everyone parks on the street or around the hotel. We never got charged for it.

Its not, so it was 30 euros for the first taxi. Then there is another problem, there is nothing near it, and when asking reception your just flat told no, although you could order chinese or pizza for delivery. At 23 euros for a pizza and two cans of coke this place is not exactly cheap, and the affiliation with the pizza place is seeing them make some money out of thier promotion. Ironically the pizza was actually very tasty, but still not worth the \u00a323/$35US any day of the week. The hotel has further problems, cleanliness, the bathroom wasn't clean, when the shower was turned on other peoples hair was floating on the water in the bath, the water which wouldn't drain away for 10 minutes AFTER you turned off the shower. I think my room must have been built on a Friday too, as running the water in the sink caused smelly water to come up through the drain in the bath - odd and repulsive at the same time.

I booked the hotel on 11 July 09 for one night and it took 2 hours to get from the airport to the hotel, a one mile journey! I was hot and tired from traveling all day and the last thing I wanted is a poorly managed system to get to the hotel. Upon arriving at the airport in Madrid, I went down to the lower level where hotel buses pick up passengers. At least I thought. I\u2019m an experienced traveler and I know how airports work. I didn\u2019t see any signs for this particular hotel so I approached a small, blue booth that says, \u201cHotel transfers\u201d above the window. I ask the girl if Holiday Inn has a bus and she said I must call the hotel. \u201cHummm\u2026\u2026..that\u2019s not a good answer\u201d I thought to myself. I mean, the sign does say \u2018hotel transfers\u2019, but I went with it. I dig out a 2 Euro coin, the only coin I have, and use a pay phone. And, by the way, making phone calls in foreign countries is a whole other adventure in itself, equal to having your teeth drilled. (2 Euro is worth about 3 dollars US\u2026so I made a $3 phone call that lasted 40 seconds.) So I call the hotel and the man answers and tells me to look for the bus \u2018Aero City\u2018. \u201cAero City?\u201d I ask him, and I ask him to spell it. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try to find the Aero City bus.\u201d He then mentions the bus charges 9 Euro. Oh, that\u2019s great. 9 Euros (about $12) to take a bus 1 mile. Now that\u2019s worth coming back to this hotel for. Anyway, I go outside to the hotel bus stand and carefully watch for the Aero City bus. Many buses come and go; hotel buses, tour buses, parking lot buses. I wait 15 minutes. The 25 minutes. Finally I\u2019m up to 55 minutes, no Aero City bus. Suddenly, I find myself at a major decision point in my life. Do I continue to wait for a fictitious bus, or do I go back inside for more mental gymnastics and risk missing my ride. My only other option was getting a taxi, which I asked about, and they charge 25 Euros. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to pay a taxi $40 US to go 1 mile. Oh well, I go back inside and pass by an information booth and ask if they\u2019ve heard of this Aero City bus. \u201cYes, senor, but you must go down to the Aero City bus desk.\u201d the lady says in broken English. Really! There\u2019s an Aero City bus desk? Wow! This is a major break through! So I go back to the area where I was before and look for the Aero City desk. Nothing. I walk up and down. Nothing. Well\u2026it couldn\u2019t hurt to ask, I go back to the \u2019Hotel transfers\u2019 desk and ask the girl, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you again but do you know where I can find the Aero City bus desk?\u201d \u201cYes, you must book it here.\u201d My eyes almost burst! If this were a Warner Brothers cartoon you would have seen steam shoot out my ears. \u201cWHAT\u201d!!!!!!!!!!!!! \u201cYou mean to tell me that I asked you a hour and a half ago how to get to the hotel and you didn\u2019t book it then, you told me to call the hotel and the idiot at the hotel told me to look for the Aero City bus, and the bus doesn\u2019t exist and I was suppose to book the bus with you FROM THE VERY BEGINNING!!!! \u201c Needless to say I was furious. How was I suppose to know where to book the bus? The guy at the hotel told me to LOOK for the bus. That doesn\u2019t mean go to a booth and book a bus. AND, the booth doesn\u2019t have Aero city written anywhere on it. How am I suppose to know all of this if you don\u2019t tell me. The girl in the booth thought is was funny. When she called the driver to come over and pick me up (speaking in Spanish), she was laughing all through the conversation. Express By Holiday Inn Madrid Aeropuerto is a terrible hotel. If any manager has the time to read this report I hope you do something about it. I started at the right place and the girl sent me away. That person should be fired. From her laughter I bet she does this to other passengers. And the idiot at the hotel needs to say go to the Hotel transfer booth, not look for a bus. Oh, by the way, the Aero City bus has no markings. It\u2019s just a blue van that someone drives. Therefore, impossible to identify. The return trip (the next day) to the airport cost me another 9 Euros and to make matters worse, if that\u2019s possible, I asked to charge the 9 Euro to my hotel room bill. I have an account and it will cover the 9 Euro. \u201cSure senor, no problem.\u201d They said they could add it to the hotel bill. The next morning I get down to the front desk at 7 am and they can\u2019t add it to the bill. Yet again, another misadvisement. Par for the course for this stupid hotel. Bottom line, don\u2019t book Express By Holiday Inn Madrid Aeropuerto. Maybe business will drop off and they will wake up and manage their hotel transfer program better.

I noticed 4 most annoying things and it is an absolute scam run by this hotel. I feel robbed. 1. The day I checked into the hotel with my family there was no air conditioning. Only the heater was working. When I enquired they said its not summer as yet. And summer will start the next day and then only the A/C (Cool air) will work. When asked what to do, they said you can leave the windows open. The next 2 days were the same. We slept with the windows open and this hotel is close to the airport (2 flights every 3 minutes) so you can literally count the number of planes landing and taking off. We had 3 nights of very bad sleep. 2. The last day when we had to check out they said the breakfast would be open only at 7.30AM. The brekfast was ready from 6.00AM itself. It was all arranged but we were told not to have a bite at all. Another 3 Hong Kong tourists and 3 Japanese tourists staying at the hotel were told the same. It is miserable not to have atleast a coffee when everything is at place from 6.00 in the morning itself. Especially with children and family accompanying you. 3. The staff at the counter are the most irresponsible and discourteous bunch of people working for this reputed brand name. 4. Being a brand name hotel the internet could have been provided free for all who stayed at the hotel. We had to go down to the lobby to collect the username and password and the time of 1 hr started from the time of issue of the paper to you. I lost 20 minutes of the 1 hr I paid for just getting back to the room. Turning on the computer. Putting in the username and password. And starting browsing. It is just daylight robbery. 5. They even dont have a complimetary pickup and drop at the airport which is just 5 minutes form from their hotel. 6. No room service for anything. 7. The food vending machine at the lobby takes only the money. It only dispenses some items. Lost 4 Euros like that when I ordered for 2 Ham Sandwiches. 8. The carpets leading to our room had on offensive odour. 9. There is no transportation near by. Everything is 14 Euros away on Taxi. So its 28 Euros for 1 trip everyday on Cabs till the TRAMS, Bus stand etc. If you are looking for budjet travel not this hotel. I didnt expect all this from a Hotel with a brand name like Holiday Inn. Really me and my family were thoroughly disappointed with this hotel and we feel swindled at this point.

The Holiday Inn chain should be ashamed to give its name to this place!", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cAverage for an airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "jcniii", "ReviewID": "UR14815598", "Content": "Yes, I agree this hotel seems to be in the middle of nowhere and is not easy to find. I had printed directions off of a major Internet site and let's just say the directions almost got us killed once or twice having us make immediate turns on the freeways!!! and actually the directions were wrong! After calling the hotel from my cell phone we got directions from our lost position and fortunately stumbled upon the place. The hotel is brand new and yes in an area where they are obviously adding more \"overnight stay\" hotels. The place was very clean and the staff was friendly. It actually only took us 10 minutes to drive to the airport from this place which is located off the A-2 in Madrid(wish I had known that to begin with as we would have found it much quicker). My biggest complaint was that the air conditioning was not working. When we asked the front desk they told us it was not cold enough yet to have it on and to open the window in our room. Since it had been very hot that day it was stiffling all night in the room and we got little sleep. I will say though even with the window open it was relatively quiet. I think they are trying to improve things though as there are signs at the round about pointing to the hotel. At 60 Euros a night we got what we paid for.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "istanbul", "Title": "\u201cworst hotel\u201d", "Author": "ybkh", "ReviewID": "UR14571938", "Content": "we have just returned a 5 day trip from madrid (holiday inn).The hotel was in the construction area, and even the traveler agents bus couldnt find it.

A word to the dinner in the hotel ( no other chance to get someting to eat as you have to walk at least for 20 min through dirty constructing areas and over the highway to find a place). On the menu with very limted choice I chose a steamed fish. The fish was steemed (maybe) but before steeming it was panfried! Taxi to downtown Madrid 25 euro to go and 25 to go back.

First, the hotel sits in the middle of a major construction zone--there is no way to walk to anything even though the website says they're next to the biggest mall in Spain. Even the taxi from the airport had trouble finding a way in. I asked about restaurants and was told it would be better to order from my room for a delivery service. (I think it's because of their location amidst all this construction). Second, their airport shuttle doesn't run unless you call them and then they told me only in the morning. There is no sign on the airport shuttle stop that lists all the hotels having a shuttle. They did run in the morning back to the airport but once I got in was told the charge was 7 euros. Third, the room air conditioning didn't work. I opened the window in the middle of the night and had to listen to some sort of clanging sound all night. Fourth, unlike other American chain hotels in Spain (such as the Mariott Renaisance at the Barcelona Airport) there is no iron in the room as the web site advertises.

Yes, it's clean but besides that, it's a terrible hotel. I stayed there just for one day and I was counting the minutes to get out of there. There is absolutely nothing around there...except buildings under construction. The web page lied about it being near the airport..it's not. The web page also states that there is a/c..yeah right. It seems that when it is a bit cool outside, they turn it off. I thought it was broken but when I asked the staff they told me that fifteen days ago they turned it off because it was a bit cool outside. It was so freakin' hot in there, that wearing clothes is not an option. I tried to make calls and none of the phones worked. I had to call a cab to take me into the city centre to find a calling place. The Staff was so cold, unhelpful, and rude. They do not want to be bothered with any problems guests are having.

I was informed by the staff at reception that if I was in any doubt booking taxi's from the train station that I should ring the hotel and they would sort it for me, which I thought was very kind of them. However, I did ring the hotel and ask them to sort me a taxi when I was stuck and I was told by the girl on the phone to get the bus!!!!!
