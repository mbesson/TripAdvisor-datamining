The first room they placed us in was a dark dingy room with a broken plasma tv that they hooked with wires into a portable television. The concierge charged us double for booking museum tickets While at the buffet, someone took our table and was extremely rude when we returned. The Management did nothing. As we were checking out, we asked them to call a taxi. The doorman took our bags and placed them in the taxi knowing that the taxi would start the meter. When I discovered the taxi meter had started before we checked out, the doorman just walked away and did nothing.This was part of our Honeymoon trip. We could not have asked for worse.

I booked through AMEX Platinum's Fine Hotels program. Maybe that was the reason, or maybe the hotel service is always this excellent, but we were treated like VIPs throughout our stay. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a 5th-floor deluxe suite, with a welcome platter of fresh fruit and a bottle of wine awaiting our entry. The room was beautifully appointed with traditional decor. Large comfy bed, luxurious curtains, even a tapestry! Separate bedroom and sitting area with a TV in each, and a balcony with a view of the Duomo and the Palazzo Vecchio. The room was not soundproofed, but I have yet to come across a hotel room in Italy that is. Also, the bathroom exhibited a slightly funky odor, but was otherwise functional and spacious. So overall, the suite was gorgeous and comfortable with only a couple of minor inconveniences.As for the hotel itself, the common areas are a stylish blend of past and present. There's a lovely courtyard with a swimming pool, and adjacent to that is the Conservatory restaurant. The breakfast buffet is average, but definitely have dinner here if you can! Best Italian meal I've ever had, hands down. Even a place like Babbo's in NY doesn't compare. Of course, it probably helped that we went on an off-season weeknight and were essentially treated to a private dinner. Still, wow.Location: As others have written, the hotel is a 10-15 minute walk from most city attractions. But it's located in a relatively quiet neighborhood. Plus it's very close to the SMN bus/train terminal, which is convenient for day excursions to Siena and other Tuscan towns, or for arrivals/departures via Eurostar.Finally, it's worth noting that Travel  Leisure magazine just ranked the Grand Hotel Villa Medici 35th in all of Europe. That's better than any other Fiorentine hotel. Considering that the place doesn't seem to be as well-known as some of its neighbors (yet), this means that we're looking at a hidden gem.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR325223292", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Dartmouth06"}, {"Content": "really nice I booked a penthouse room.

We called the hotel for assistance (which they offered) but there simply were no cabs to be had so we jumped on a city bus.The staff recognised our frustration and swung into action - ushered us to a complimentary breakfast while we awaited our room / offered changing facilities if our son wished to swim immediately and then, after a brief wait, escorted us to a huge renovated room with a thirteen foot ceiling. We were on a shopping package offered by the hotel which offered a very fair rate, a restaurant meal and a shopping tour. The concierge staff were extremely helpful in booking reservations for additional tours, gallery admissions and trains.The restaurant in the hotel was excellent. The pool area was our little oasis as temperatures approached a sweltering 37+ celsius. Service was flawless.The walk to the centre of town (or a brief cab ride) was a fair trade for the relief that the pool provided and the welcome attitude.Our experience was first class, exceeded our expectations and we will return to this property and highly recommend it to friends (especially those with children during summer heat!).
