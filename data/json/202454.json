Generally the hotel is preferred due its location to my meeting place and there's a subway station just a stone's throw away and a medium-sized shopping mall (with McDonalds) just across the street. I found it clean and the room amenities are well maintained. Found the pillows too soft, and I had neckaches too often as a result. There was also no coffee making facilities and sachets of tea or instant coffee, as well as no hot water kettle was given in the room. Now comes the other parts which I didnt like. The breakfast buffet was pretty below average and the waiting staff were cold, stern-looking and robot-like. Tables have to be shared with strangers due to over-crowding in the morning. Basic breakfast items like fried eggs and bacon & sausages have to be specially ordered and they often forget what you ordered. The quality of the food was rather poor and unpalatable.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - pitty I only stayed for 1 night\u201d", "Author": "cincom_traveller", "ReviewID": "UR125122164", "Content": "The hotel is nice, the building is impressive, the rooms are comfortable and spacious and they serve a great room service meal.

Two out of three isn't bad, but I didn't realize that until it was too late. The hotel itself is quite nice and modern in design. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the internet is free and has good flow. As others have written, breakfast here is plentiful with a wide selection and quite good. The room itself was comfortable and modern. Clean and fresh. Bathroom was nice and spacious and in my room there was a large curtained window that looked down into the courtyard below - which is opportune if you want to give the people down below a show! The odd thing I thought was the bathroom condiments. I had just come from the Best Western in Bamberg where they offered a wide array of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc, and here I was at a Best Western Premier hotel and all they had were the wall mounted shampoo-slash-body wash dispensers. Kinda disappointing when this is supposed to be amongst the chains best. Then there was the parking. Parking is available, down the block and across the street in the Borsigturm parking garage. Just drive there and bring your ticket back and it's something like 6,50 euros. Inconvenient at best. You'd think they would have designed this building with parking. I was a bit irritated by this situation and decided to worry about it after I had returned from my cruise around Berlin. After doing my thing around the city, I returned to the hotel around 11pm and found plenty of street parking that was formerly occupied by the office workers in the surrounding buildings - so parking was then easy and free! Overall, I liked this hotel and would probably stay here again.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, beautiful, great service AND cheap...this one's the whole package!\u201d", "Author": "kiwimusume", "ReviewID": "UR114847967", "Content": "I know the title line might make me sound like a member of the hotel's advertising team, but I cannot rave enough about this hotel.

The lady at the checkin desk was very helpful and gave me information and advice about the area. The room was comfortable and spacious with user-friendly wifi available.

The hotel is situated in the Tegel area, next to a shopping centre and cinema complex. In this complex is a fitness centre, which hotel guests can use free of charge. It is a modern building in what used to be the Borsig factory complex. Many of the old factory buildings have been converted to offices etc. A nice area. But to the important stuff: rooms average size, neutral decor, two twin beds (no doubles), enough wardrobe space for a long weekend, nicely laid out, limited choice minibar but with fair prices, bathroom with good size shower cubicle, but no bath. Proper hairdryer - not one of those where you have to hold the button down all the time. Even with a cool shot to set your style! One minor complaint - the safe in the wardrobe is on the top shelf. To see inside it you have to be 2m tall. Or stand on a chair. The breakfast buffet was excellent, with lots of types of meats and cheeses. Best of all, you could order FRESHLY MADE eggs and bacon, pancakes, milkshakes, and there was a machine with FREE coffee (latte, espresso) available 24 HOURS. Internet acccess is also FREE, although there are only 2 computers and one was broken when we were there. Not a big deal. Parking is a bit of a hassle, as the hotel only has 15 spaces in the driveway. But the shopping centre car park is a short walk away and is manned 24 hours a day. Parking is Euro 5.50 per exit, so if you stay 3 days and never move your car, it costs Euro 5.50.... The U6 underground station was nearby. The hotel rents out bikes, which several people were using whilst we were there. There is a nice Italian (Montichiello) oposite the Borsig gate and a fabulous and cheap (for German standards) Thai restaurant in a side street off the Berliner Strasse (Brunowstr. 8). It's called Ruan-Thai. Go there.
