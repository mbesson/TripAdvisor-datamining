You turn over to discover an uncomfortable ridge in the middle of the bed.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our 'Chef for a day' experience, learning how to make pasta and how to impress our guests with the finer details of a meal! The Executive Chef, Steven Krasicki, welcomed us warmly, and was relaxed and so knowledgeable about food. He sat with us to eat lunch, which was superbly presented and served, as we soaked in the outstanding views. It was an excellent way to spend 4 hours on a Saturday! Our room on the 26th floor was superbly clean, bed was very comfortable and the view was the best that Sydney Harbour can offer!! We were also delighted to receive a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates in our room to help us celebrate. When we returned to our room in the evening, we were again surprised to have a special cheese plate in our room from the Executive Chef wishing us an enjoyable stay. This finished the day beautifully! Thank you Chef! The weekend was capped off with a sumptuous buffet breakfast, and a quiet read of the newspaper in our room until check-out at 11am.

Rooms are quiet, private and relaxing, a perfect retreat after a long day; 5. Cafe Mix has the best hotel breakfast buffet I have come across in any of my stays The NOT so good: 1. Although the reservation was made in my name and I was paying the bill, for some odd reason each time I spoke to hotel personnel from my room phone, the operator addressed me under my partner's name instead of mine. I politely attempted to inform the hotel staff, but the error was not corrected and I let it go -- not a big thing, but it feels somewhat disrespectful if I am the person paying the bill and had tried to address the matter. 2. Location: Shangri-La, Sydney is located on a steep hill. Unless you are driving/being driven to/from the hotel, you will get a workout...and I REALLY pity women who are wearing high heals and have been out to dinner or at an event and drinking. Be careful!

Room: I've had exactly the same room before the refurb and do appreciate the padding adding to the sills for window seats. bed comfy as always and so quiet we slept till after 9am, usually I am up and around at 7am. Restaurants and Bars: Original plan was Opera bar for a snack before the show but the torrential rain and late arrival at the hotel made this less than attractive. We were booked in Altitude for Pre theatre and had an amazing meal (3 courses in total but only 2 each) within an hour. Not close together but made it in plenty of time to catch the taxi to The House. (Still torrential rain) Service was excellent and food very very good. Breakfast: Been a bit spoiled lately so Mix wasn't knock you socks off in comparison to Grand Hyatt or Sebel Adelaide.

We enjoyed the starter buffet at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Mix and the cocktails and the sunset at the Blu Bar. We also enjoyed the pool and spa area - very relaxing. As an added bonus they were filming Masterchef for the next Australian series during our stay too! As fans of the UK series, this was a nice little extra. Unfortunately one of us was taken ill during the stay. The hotel could not have been more helpful and understanding at what became an extremely stressful time. In particular the hotel manager, Loa Menon was simply outstanding. It is the last thing you expect to happen on holiday and her support and assistance to us was amazing and unfaltered. As an advocate of smaller hotel chains and boutique accommodation, I rarely opt for the larger chains as I often feel they lack the personal touch.

It is true to say I was excited about this two night stay as it was part of a gift and the thought of being a tourist in my own city somehow really appealed. We had booked a Premium Grand Harbour Room and were given a corner room on the 19th floor. The package included valet parking, full breakfast each morning as well as a bottle of champagne for each day as well as one on arrival. They were happy for us to not open the champagne but to take them home if that was what we preferred. Opening the curtains to the view of Circular Quay, Sydney Opera House and down the harbour and out to North Head literally took my breath away, even on that wet, grey and cloudy day. We marvelled at the beautiful cruise ship moored at the international terminal and never tired of watching the traffic coming ofer the Harbour Bridge. This is, without doubt, one of the world's most spectacular views and I was both buoyed by it and annoyed with myself that familiarity had made me oblivious to it. Our bags arrived almost as soon as we did and a request for fresh milk taken care of just as quickly. The room had wonderful natural light, king sized bed, separate sitting area with comfortable lounges, and black-out curtains that did not gape. The windows are triple glazed so there is little sound and they are set back to create window seats for sitting, watching and dreaming. Tea and coffee are provided, of course and there is a safe large enough to hold a laptop or handbag. The bathroom was marble and while not being overly large was well designed with a separate shower (a personal plus from me) separate bath and quality toiletries. The room also provided bathrobes and slippers. All in all a very lovely hotel room to spend time in. Our initial plan was to go out to dinner but the initial weather was foul so we opted to eat in-house on the first evening. Altitude Restaurant, their flagship restaurant is probably very nice and the view no doubt spectacular. However, the menu prices took our breath away! So we went down to Cafe Mix on either the 1st or 2nd floor which is a restaurant at night and breakfast room in the morning. This has an unfortunate name as it is so much more than a Cafe. The staff there were warm and welcoming and the Seafood Buffet on offer amazingly good. With sushi, Indian, roasts etc all vying for attention next to the seafood offerings, it was a wonderful meal. Hard to do justice to the amazing dessert buffet there as well. I recommend Cafe Mix to you highly! Also available on the ground floor is a Bar/Lounge where both coffee, tea etc as well as alcoholic beverages are available as well as cakes, toasted sandwiches can be purchased. A nice spot to sit and read or work. The Shangri La Hotel is close to The Rocks, it is true, but it is not that easy to access. There is one obvious, straightforward way to go but it is steep with stairs and not suited to many. There are taxis on tap at all times however. However, with trial and error we found there were many, many other ways to go, some of which are actually interesting walks through less touristy parts of The Rocks. Here is my one and only gripe with the Shangri La. They have a Concierge Desk but it is always, always busy with people needing assistance. If the Shangri La made a point whenever they employ ANY new staff member from cleaner to General Manager to take them on a walk around their environs, when people like me ask \"how do I get to.......?\" they will be able to tell them. The hotel has a back door for instance which leads onto a lovely walk, also there are stairs and a road that take you onto the other side of the Cahill Expressway where there are new archeaological diggings etc. Educating staff would be so much better than the blank look and shrug that EVERYONE gives you!! Despite the hotel itself being totally suitable if you are disabled or have small children, because of its position, it may prove awkward for sightseeing unless you are happy to use taxis from time to time..", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aussie", "Title": "\u201cA favorite hotel chain\u201d", "Author": "AussieBD", "ReviewID": "UR127105278", "Content": "I enjoy staying at this groups hotel as I've alway fund the suites and service excellent and the Sydney hotel lives up to the standard.

We are foodies, and wanted to eat at two of the most booked restaurants in Sydney: Quay and Tetsuyas. Before visiting, we tried to get reservations ourselves, but were unable to. Somehow, the concierge was able to get us reservations for both! All in all, a wonderful stay. The Shangri-La chain is not well known in the U.S., but I would definitely recommend it to Americans.

It cost A$500.20 per night for a Premier Grand Harbour View Room with daily buffet breakfast at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Mix. The hotel is located in the Rocks area just a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw away from Circular Quay, where the Opera House and Harbor Bridge are located. The main hotel entrance is located at the top of a steep hill. However, there is another entrance (Lower Ground level when you take the hotel elevators) on Gloucester Street, thus you would only need to climb half way up the steep hill. However, for check-in purposes you need to go to the main entrance. Upon arrival, I was greeted and bags taken promptly. The hotel lobby is not as grand or luxurious as compared to other Shangri-La hotels or its neighbor The Four Seasons. I arrived at 1pm and was told that my room was not available and had to wait 1hour. The receptionist said that she would phone me to let me know when the room was available. I decided to have some tea at the lobby lounge which cost A$7.50 a cup. The service was average, at times unprofessional when the young waiters were chatting away about their personal lives. After 1hr, there was no phone call, so I decided to approach the reception. I was surprised to find out that my room was still not ready. Another receptionist, Louis, was nice enough to offer me another room on a different floor that was currently available. However, it would have been better if they had called me earlier to inform me about this so that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait that long. The room is probably the main reason why one would choose to stay at this hotel. The premier grand harbor view room was stunning. It provides a 270 degree view of the Sydney harbor bridge and the opera house. You could also see the rooms from the adjacent Four Seasons hotel and Quay West. I could just lie in bed the whole day long with views of the opera house at my feet. The size of the room was quite big, giving you the feel of a junior suite. There was a large king bed that was on the softer side which was very comfortable for me. The room had a large flat screen TV, lounge area with nice sofa and also a work desk. Working the curtains was quite a chore (especially when you had really wide windows!) as you had to use quite a bit of strength to draw and un-draw them. Ideally, there should be remote-controlled blinds like in other hotels. The bathroom was nice but did not have in-built TV in the mirror or bath tubs with a view. Toiletries were also Shangri-La products and not L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122occitane. Daily newspapers were provided and there was complimentary wireless internet access. House-keeping service was excellent. The room was well cleaned. Whatever I asked for (extra bathroom slippers, tea towels) was delivered promptly. Room service was excellent. I had the spaghetti bolognaise and the fish and chips which was excellent. However, be careful as the price of the items stated on the menu may not be the actual price charged. The delivery of food was prompt and the presentation was good. The whole experience of having a meal in the comfort of your room with stunning views of the harbor was amazing. I had my buffet breakfast everyday at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Mix. The staff was very friendly, efficient and professional. The buffet spread was good but was mostly the same every day. I usually went around 930-1030am and the place was not crowded at all. I used the spa twice during my stay. The service and ambience were excellent. Catherine, one of the staff, was very friendly and helped to arrange my appointments. The massage service was excellent and tailored to your needs. There was also a high level of privacy ensured for the guests. Check out was efficient. The person who checked me out helped take my bags to the entrance and got me a taxi which was a nice personal touch. Overall, the best part of the entire experience was the room itself. You pay for the stunning views and the spacious rooms.

Views are good from the Club Lounge, which overlooks the bridge and Opera House. Staff attentive with their drinks service. I'll give them that. Food on offer pretty average to be honest. Mini quiches that were warm and rubbery come to mind. The freshest thing on offer appeared to be my bread roll which I had with butter. Not the best at all that we have had.

I adore the amenities and the generous provision of them - some so called 4-5 star hotels do not even provide slippers (which I believe are hygenic & essential) - this hotel provides it all. The little box of complimentary chocolates was very nice, the room service food tasty and timely (I really appreciate the Asian cuisine) and the staff lovely.

This spacious suite was perfect as we were traveling with 2 others who wanted to be able to sit and chat with us - so this living room area with the view was PERFECT. The room came with access to the Horizon Club on 30th floor where you can have tea/coffee/drinks/snacks and eat breakfast (or you can eat at Cafe Mix buffet). The Horizon Club has multi-floor glass looking out over the Harbor. The bathroom was lovely and spacious. It is across the hall from the bedroom - which my husband likes as he often gets up before I do and this way he doesn't worry about waking me. When we arrived the bathroom sink wasn't draining well - we called and it was fixed in a snap! The TV sets (living room and bedroom) were of high quality with plenty of channels to surf. There was a DVD player in the living room which we used and enjoyed. The desk is comfortable and there was free wireless internet which was of high quality. The minibar and tea/coffee service was well stocked. Only wish was for a sink in this area as we had to walk down hall for water for kettle - but this was a VERY minor inconvenience. The bedroom had a wonderfully comfortable King bed. Bedroom included a larger than usual safe in the closet, robes, and plenty of drawer and closet space (and another closet in the hallway) and another desk and small sitting area. The service was excellent throughout the hotel. The food in the Horizon club was lovely. Drink service there in evening lovely. This is an expensive hotel - but it's worth it. And we felt the upgrade to the suite with access to the Horizon club was worth it. Most especially the living room space was wonderful for the quality time it allowed us to share with others. We sat and enjoyed each other and the most amazing views of the harbor. If you can afford it, it's worth the splurge. The only draw back to this hotel is that it is at the top of a steep hill (2 steep staircases). It's a bit hard on our knees to go up and down to the Circular Quay / Rocks area causing us not to do as much in the Rocks as we might have otherwise. A small problem. My suggestion to the hotel would be to consider a courtesy shuttle up and down the hill to the Rocks/Circular Quay area. On the plus side, being on top of the hill creates these magnificent views.

We like the place overall and will probably keep coming back. The rooms (we had a Grand Harbour View Horizon Club Room this time) are very good sizes and have some of the best views in the world looking out over the famous Sydney icons of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. When booking you need to make sure the room you book has the view you require. We have heard of people booking Darling Harbour view rooms thinking that this was Sydney Harbour. If you want the best views you need the North facing rooms or corners on the North side and need to be as high as possible. If you do decide to go for one of the rooms on one of the other sides then going for the Horizon Club means you can have breakfast, tea, coffee & soft drinks during the day and canapes and alcohol in the evening on the 30th floor with views over the Opera House, Bridge and harbour out to the Heads. We usually go to the main restaurant for breakfast as the choice is greater although the service is usually lacking and the majority of the staff don't seem to want to be there! It is a buffet style though so the service doesn't detract too much. The main time for the Horizon Club lounge is from 18:00 to 20:00 as this is when the canapes and alcoholic drinks are served as part of the package. The quality of the drinks is good with good Australian sparkling wine free flowing and as far as I know all other drinks you would expect. The canapes are however a little more hit and miss. Sometimes they are good and sometimes less so. Also the service at the busier times particularly can be lacking. There are some excellent members of staff such as Jerry and Melanie who are very attentive but there are also those that are not so good. We did have a little grumble to guest services one morning about turn down service and the service one night in the Horizon Club and on returning to our room at the end of the day were greeted with a bottle of sparkling wine and a box of chocolates. Sabina the Horizon Club manager who is also excellent, apologised for the slip in service when we next saw her. Despite a few slips generally we love staying here.

This practice is totally unfair for the guests who made an effort to dress accordingly. (d) Many evenings it was standing room only with many guests having to stand up because of insufficient seating arrangements.

I made the booking directly on the hotel website. Arrival Experience I parked the car and then caught a bus down George Street till I was just near the hotel entrance. I then discovered that it was quite difficult to walk up the hill and get to the hotel entrance. I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really explored this part of Sydney much in the past so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know that the hill would be quite that steep. I must have entered from a side entrance and not the main entrance. There was no help with the luggage offered. The reception was friendly enough, generally quite good with the attitude and I was welcomed as a Golden Circle member even though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just joined prior to making the booking and this was my first stay in a Shangri-La property. I was afforded an early check-in at around 11 am. I went to the lift and immediately there was an issue with the lift key-card not working but it worked in a different lift. The Room The room appeared on entry to be quite spacious but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a room with much of a wow factor, the Shangri-La in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia being a little more impressive. The room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very complicated and I suppose aimed for a simpler design. The furniture was a little bit worn in places, the lounge set although nice looked a little cheap and perhaps more could have been expected for a hotel of this level. It was pleasing to note that the curtains were completely blackout. The bathroom was also nice and luxurious, probably the most immediately impressive feature of the room. It was quite a large bathroom compared to the small one at the Intercontinental in Sydney. The bed was quite nice and comfortable, a little on the softer side but recently, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve discovered that softer beds could probably provide a better sleep particularly if sleeping positioned on the side sometimes. There didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be too much complimentary mineral water provided in the room with just small bottles provided. It was pleasing to see the complimentary internet access in the room though, which was free of charge as in all Shangri-La properties. The room experienced a little elevator noise but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t excessive by any means. My room overlooked the harbour and the expressway but it was high enough so that there was no noise pollution and the view of Circular Quay was quite impressive, although the view of the Opera House was not direct and there were buildings directly opposite. I have videos of the hotel room and functions on the link within my profile section. Location and Facilities The first thing to point out is the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location on top of a hill which made the walk there quite difficult when returning and even more difficult with luggage, as I mentioned earlier. Generally, when looking at a map though, the hotel is located in the historic Rocks area of Sydney with plenty of historic sights nearby. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also close to Circular Quay and the Sydney Harbour and for a more solid shopping experience, I suppose the main shopping areas of George Street and Pitt Street would be only about 10 minutes walk away or even shorter by bus along George Street. The immediate area did seem to be very quiet and dark at night, as I took a walk around. There weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too many places to eat but I managed to find an Indian restaurant nearby which was alright but a little pricey, perhaps suggesting that the Rocks area charges tourist-level prices in general. I managed to try out the pool and to have a look at the Jacuzzi, which were right next to each other. I expected both of them to be a little smarter as the pool was just adequate and heated but the Jacuzzi/hot tub was small and filled with children at the time. I might have been mistaken but I thought that with the amount of focus on the CHI spa concept at the Shangri La and on their website, they might have offered a jacuzzi experience of note but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. The equivalent at the Shangri-La in Kuala Lumpur was much more impressive. There were plenty of lifts operating in the hotel so that was never an issue. The lobby was quite good and luxurious in its setting but not over the top, it was probably a little low-key by the standards of most luxury hotels and not on the same scale or level as the Shangri-La in Kuala Lumpur. Staff Service Apart from receiving no assistance with the luggage earlier in the day, the only time I called upon the staff was when I experienced a problem with the door lock later in the evening as it failed to lock; it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long after a call to the helpdesk to sort the issue out but the staff member mentioned after I asked that the problem was quite common with the new door locks that they had put in place. Conclusion Overall, the hotel appeared to be quite solid in all aspects but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really say that it was exceptional and that would be my general assessment of the property hardware and service levels.

We arrived at the hotel by their Limo pick-up around 12:00 noon. Understand it was peak season during new year, room not ready. We were simply told by front desk \"oh, room will only be ready at 14:00\". Guess what, the room got ready at 13:57. How accurate!! The hotel had zero intention to accomodate guests travelling with young kids. The houskeeping was the worst, I even wonder if they ever cleaned the room. The bathroom was basically not cleaned except taking away some towels without replacing hand towels for 3 days. The studying table and bedside tables were not even wiped from the day we checked in till departure. The room was left exactly the same shape everyday we left the room except taking away towels and put back pillows, nothing was done!! We left some garbage on the top of the trash bin on 31st Dec, they were not cleaned aways till the 1st Jan afternoon after one clean-up and 2 turn down bed service. Subsquenty, we had to take the trash bags and leave them in front of our door. If any of the hotel management still care about your review at tripadvisor, please go ahead and check your CCTV around 17;00-19:00 at room 1013. Call housekeeper? That's what we thought, eventually it took at least one hour for any request. The entire hotel had an attitude it was so normal due to peak season. The funnest story was that we requested to have a bucket of ice, after waiting for 2 hours, they called back and said it will charge AUD 10 for delivery fee due to peak season.I know internet, extra bed, and breakfast can be at extra charge in all hotels. But delivery fee AUD 10 for a bucket of ice for an AUD 1,000 room? Never heard of it.

We arrived at the hotel and the parking attendant was very friendly, reception where also very efficient and friendly (no big line ups which is one of my pet peeves). We were delighted to find we were upgraded to the next room level of Executive Grand Harbour Suite for our anniversary. It is so nice to get some level of recognition when you are staying for a special event. Unlike another Sydney hotel which actually provided below even a basic level of service on my recent birthday, the Shangri-la went out of their way to make us feel special which was really lovely. The room was absolutely amazing, with it's own foyer, 2nd toilet, huge entertaining/lounge area and cavernously big bedroom and bathroom with a huge soaking bath all of which had huge windows with sweeping views all around Sydney Harbour and the city. We were on the 9th floor and the views were amazing - you could gaze out over the Harbour bridge and Opera House from the lounge and watch the ferries coming and going and general activity below. The finishes in the hotel are top class. From the custom made carpet, to the room furnishings. It smelled lovely and fresh, like it had recently been refurbed. And we could have slept on the super comfy soft bed forever. The entertainment system was top class also with DVD players in both rooms and ipod player. The blinds were also remote controlled, so all little luxuries were thought of. We didn't get a chance to try the day spa but it looked really lovely with lots of treatments to try. The only thing that let the hotel down slightly was the in room service which was difficult to get through to (the morning we ordered brekkie at around 9.30am or so) after phoning 3 or 4 times we ended up ringing the concierge to help us with it. And it took 30+ minutes to turn up which seemed a bit excessive given it wasn't peak service time (I would think). Also we phoned to order an iron after the in room one went missing, and ended up phoning back 2 further times over the next 30 minutes as we were trying to make it out of the room in a reasonable time. It eventually turned up. The hotel is in a great position from which to explore Sydney on foot, if you are first time visitors. Circular Quay/The Rocks is only a 5 or 6 minute walk and Pitt Street Mall is only 10-12 minutes at most. Chinatown would be a further 5-6 minutes from there.

For a hotel to be 5 star I believe that the service needs to be consistently excelent.

Maybe it's common practice in Australia but I haven't experienced before. Secondly and more importantly it took over an hour for my bags to reach my room. The hotel didn't seem particularly busy at the time and I had to chase the porter team. My other concern was the price of incidentals. Possibly this is due to the strength of the Australian dollar but the room service menu and mini bar was vastly over-priced compared to anything I've seen elsewhere.

The room was on the side of the hotel with good views of the Opera House and towards the botanical gardens. Our room was spacious, spotlessly clean and had additional luxuries such as bathrobes, fresh fruit and free bottled water replaced daily. The Horizon Club gives you a separate check in desk on the 30th floor and all day access to the club lounge which includes breakfast, afternoon tea and 2 hrs of drinks and canap\u00c3\u00a9s in the evening.

Plus you get the fantastic views of the bridge and Opera House. It was certainly worth paying the extra for the additional benefits the Horizon Club provided. We dined once and had a very good meal in the Cafe Mix restaurant on the 1st floor. The prices were typical of a decent restaurant, so although it was not cheap it was certainly less expensive than some of the establishments surrounding Circular Quay.

From there it went from nice to amazing. I would upgrade to this floor to live if I could. They start off by making this the center of your interaction with the hotel. If you need to check in, check out, boarding passes, order a car, concierge, directions anything they are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. In addition they seem to care. Every morning I came in they brought over a cup of coffee. Now this may seem so what but I drink just coffee and they had an epresso machine that could launch a missile if you wanted. Yet they knew I just wanted brewed coffee, not an americano just coffee. From there it was the same every time I was there. The food is excellent day and evening and the floor is just a great place to get work done quietly. The rooms are definitely better than what I experienced on the regular floors. The quality of the furnishings and the room size was just excellent on an international level. I assume the other rooms are also on an upgrade list but these were delightful.

Previous Shangri La experiences in Singapore and Penang had been satisfactory so we opted for a change this time on a visit with one of our adult sons. We spent three nights in the Sydney Shangri La in two rooms at a total cost of well over $3000.00. The rooms were very well appointed but that's where it ends. The hotel is devoid of any character and the whole ethos of the place seems based on ensuring that they get their money rather than look after their guests. Two examples; On arrival we found ourselves in a room on the 5th floor looking towards the harbour with a nasty view of the back of an industrial building rather than of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge we had booked and were expecting although both were distantly visible. I raised the issue politely and was told that there was a better room on a higher floor but that I would have to pay extra which I agreed to do rather than get involved in a potentially adversarial discussion. I had the impression that my problem was one they experienced frequently as the patter seemed rather too well rehearsed. At breakfast the next day there was a problem as one of the rooms was aparently showing as breakfast included in the rate and the other was not. Instead of accepting that a simple administrative error had occurred which could be easily rectified later the lady in charge made a big issue of it which resulted in a long and totally unnecessary discussion albeit reasonably polite and civilised. We did not eat in the hotel again. Our strong impression was that the Shangri La in Sydney was simply a money making machine with no interest in the customers well being or satisfaction. It was very busy so perhaps they simply do not have to try very hard. Expensive nice rooms. Nothing else. Do not assume a great view as per the website impressions.

However, the hotel itself is your typical, huge, behemoth of a structure that is cold, and void of any special character within the walls of the structure. Think Marriott Marquis in the heart of Times Square in NYC and you will get the picture. I'm probably not the one to provide a very fair comparison of what is nice and what is not because of my extensive travel all over the globe - I'm hard to please now because I've seen the best and worst - and to me I see a lot of very average when traveling - and the Shangri-La is very average to a non-tourist type travelor like myself. I can see where some who are tourists and travel a few times a year may like this atmosphere. Australia is a long distance for most so this would be a once in a lifetime adventure for many, I'm sure. Therefore, I suspect this is the reason for several very positive reviews. The hotel has all the basic services and it would be highly unlikely that a hotel of this size and turnover (most guests probably rarely return here - more like a once in a lifetime trip type place) will be able to provide true 5+-star services, accomodations, and amenities that a Mandarin Oriental type property provides. I have also stayed at the Four Seasons Sydney next door to Shangri-La, and while general service there is better, the massive tourist hotels in \"The Rocks\" area of Sydney at least in the same size category are all basically generic, large, high turnover offerings - not overly bad but certainly nothing extraordinary about them. Service at the Shangri-La is very spotty. Restaurants close early and are generally packed and terribly expensive. I spend a lot of money in hotels and don't mind spending money on room service and eating in the hotel restaurants, but this is one property that I have no problem with walking out for a nice meal given the outrageous (i.e. tourist rip-off) pricing! I went down to try the breakfast \"buffet\" and was \"processed\" like a herd of cattle into the restuarant - Vegas style type setup and offered the AUD $42 buffet. I politely declined and went down the street and had a nice Starbucks. I then walked around and realized there are tons of good, reasonably priced places to eat that the locals/office buildings take advantage of - only vulnerable tourists who are hungry and without many options being unfamiliar with the area would suffer through these mass production ordeals for eating in the hotel. The comments about the strenuous \"walk up the hill\" to reach the hotel should be heeded by people with any sort of disability or who don't want the trek - every time you go anywhere, you must encounter this steep hill. The other hotels of similar size and quality are actually \"down the hill\" so they are much more convenient from a pure assessibility perspective. On a positive note, aside from the room being overly cold (it was very damp/chilly/cold in Sydney so I'm not sure if they hotel even had the heat on), the bed was comfortable. Room furnishings were adequate and typical of large properties. The bathroom was o.k. - but the shower was one of those prefab type things that was not large enough to really utilize - whereas the separate bath was something I didn't even use. I'm sure this is personal preference though. Don't think of asking for anything out of the ordinary to disrupt staff routine. It's not their fault though because of the sheer number of people coming/going from this property. For example, when I called down because the room was too cold and the heat was not working, no one had come to check on it for ever 2 hours, so I called back down again - finally 3.5 hours after the first call someone came up from engineering and basically said the system was working normally despite the room being cold and no air coming out of the vents. I think the entire hotel is on some main system that does not allow some rooms to have heat while the others have A/C, perhaps. So yes, the views are incredible - but they are also incredible when you walk outside for free and see the Opera House and Harbour Bridge! Despite it being nice, this place is very, very average to me and in some respects bad due to the ripoff pricing and inability of the hotel to provide any level of personal service due to its sheer size. Nothing horrendous to report, but nothing extraordinary either - well, except the views which do make up for some of the negatives. Enjoy if you must, but don't hesitate to book at other similar properties in the immediate vicinity - for me, the next trip it will bascially come down to where I can get the best price and amenities at whatever 5-star property in this area is available.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, England", "Title": "\u201cThe Most Amazing View\u201d", "Author": "CalverleyRhino", "ReviewID": "UR120823716", "Content": "What a fantastic hotel, top quality.

Next, we called room service to order dinner. NO ANSWER. Tried again, NO ANSWER. Tried again and again and no one picked up. We let it ring about twenty times each call.

The bellman eventually brought up our luggage and we told him we wanted to order dinner but there was no answer. So he tried too, no answer. So then he dialed some other back number extension and finally got someone to take our order. Not a good start. Dinner came late and was wrong. We ordered an entree and a grilled cheese.

The room is quite large and has a comfy couch and some window seats to appreciate the view. The bathroom was another highlight for me - it was huge, with a beautiful big bath, perfect shower, and huge vanity. There were also speakers in there so that if the TV is on, you can listen to it while in the bathroom. The only annoying thing about this feature is that you couldn't turn it off if you didn't want it on in the bathroom, you had to turn the TV off. Annoying if one person wants to watch tv while the other relaxes quietly in the bath. Check-out was also smooth. Service was very good. I did not eat at the restaurants or have room service as it was a bit too expensive for me.

My husband and I wandered the streets and harbour area of Sydney until we were basically asleep on our feet. I suggested going to the hotel and throwing ourselves on the mercy of the hotel to see if they'd let us into our room a little early. We arrived at the hotel and requested an early check-in. The clerk did some checking and probably some re-arranging and we were able to check in over an hour early. We weren't able to get a room with one bed, but we were happy to be allowed to check in early. (To be fair, our initial reservation wasn't for a one bed room.) Our room was very nice. The room was clean and comfortable. Our view was of the Sydney Opera House, and the surrounding area. It was great. The first evening we were at the hotel we went up to the bar on the 36th floor. We had a few problems reading the menu as it was so dark up there. I realise that everyone wants to see the view, but a little more light would be nice! Over the next few days a couple of problems developed with our room. My husband took a bath and when he let the water out, it came out a drain underneath the sink unit. The floor of the bathroom was flooding. It didn't cause our property any damage, but we couldn't let the water out without a flood. We notified the front desk and they promised to have maintenance look at it. A couple of days later, my husband took another bath and when he let the water out, the water came out of the drain underneath the sink again. It flooded again. The night before we checked out I noticed that the desk and the countertop on top of the fridge and room supplies was covered in dust. I was surprised. We had dinner at Cafe Mix on our last evening in Sydney and it was wonderful. It was a little pricey, but no worse than any of the other restaurants in Sydney we visited.

We had booked a room with two doubles on a club level with Oprah House view room through American Express Fine Hotels (a benefit for AmEx Platinum card holders). Upon checking in at their special desk for VIP check-in I was told that I was booked on a low-level room. Upon inquiry on why I was down-graded I was told that this was what was reserved by AmEx. Thankfully, upon showing my confirmation they were able to give me the room I booked. The agent even went up and showed us a couple of different options. The room we chose would be ready at 1pm. No problem there. The room had no-doubt the most spectacular view possible in Sydney. The room itself was nicely appointed with comfy beds and large bathroom. If I could, I would have stolen the shower head as it was one of the nicest I have ever experienced. I really enjoyed having free access to Wi-Fi and business center even though the Wi-Fi was very shotty and would often kick you off.

We were glad the breakfast was included because it would of cost us $78 otherwise (making it the most expensive breakfast I have ever seen).The bar on the top floor in my opinion was way overrated. There was nothing special there other than the views and the expensive prices. The location, while very close to the Oprah House, Harbor Bridge, ferry station, The Rocks, and downtown, is up a very steep hill meaning that whenever you walk you should be prepared for a work-out.

I've read other reviews on this hotel and some have been quite negative, but I have to say, it looks like they have taken some of this comments on board and have made a significant improvement as I could not fault any of the staff I came across. The only issue I did have was their alternative to feathered bedding is not as good as other 4 or 5 star hotels I have stayed in. I hope they address this problem and take into consideration that not everyone can sleep with feathers and the replacement bedding should be of equal standard.

Foyer - I must admit when walking into the Observatory Hotel foyer we were immersed in the smell of flowers and inspired by the attention to detail for an entrance. Amora also had a pleasant foyer with some innovation. The Shangri-La's foyer? A tad boring. I think that they stopped trying to add the little touches that make a difference to an entrance. The flowers were boring and the foyer didn't have an atmosphere. However, just because the foyer didn't live up to our expectations didn't mean we didn't enjoy the Shangri-La. A real positive for the Shangri-La compared to the others is that you got a sense that this hotel was efficient and a well oiled machine. It felt like it was very well managed and serviced to the highest level. Our Executive Room was very roomy and clean. The bed extremely comfortable. Things we noticed: the carpet was very soft and excellent quality compared to other hotels. The staff were friendly and and helpful too. The tv offered some information about facilities at the hotel but there was no booklet to let a new traveller in on what the hotel had to offer which I felt I wanted to find out but I couldn't. The other hotels had this and it made it easier to explore the hotel and see what it offered their guests outside the room. We had dinner at the Altitude Restaurant. We enjoyed our meals, but was disappointing that a large part of the menu was game, fish and heavy meat dishes. We felt like something less heavy but there wasn't a lot of variety. We throughly enjoyed the buffet at Cafe Mix. Which overall was a real winner for us. The experience and food was very memorable and part of our room rate.

The location is also excellent with a few tips re this. Having also stayed at the Four Seasons nearby earlier I can compare with that hotel. We stayed in September and the Sydney weather was lovely- the price of the Shangri-la and the Four Seasons at that time were comparable for the weekend ( The Four Seasons was more) and the rooms were much bigger at the Shangri -La so we went for this hotel to try it. We had a Harbour View room with a truely amazing view out over the Opera House all the way to the Harbour Heads and a good sized and nicely decorated bathroom with very pleasantly scented bath products. Don't forget to mention if you have a special event in your email to book because the hotel does seem to make the extra effort. It was a special occasion, so we requested a high floor-22nd floor it had a great view for no more cost- and we received a truely delicious little cake- great chocolate- some of the best I have tasted! The location is brilliant - in terms of being close to things but it is at the top of a small hill. This is good for the amazing views and if you go to breakfast at the rocks or the Harbour Bridge as it means you don't have to go up the hill to them- you are on the same level and cut across. However, if you go down to Circular Quay to the ferries and Opera House or to shop you do need to come back up. We found you can come up by using the Four Seasons lift to the third floor-still a public area and outside to the right and up one brick stair and we were at the Shangri La- a bit cheeky but very easy! The Shangri-La has a very nice bar at the top of the hotel with some spectacular night view to the Bridge and city from one end- perhaps get there a little early to get a good table down that side. We prefered the foyer of the Shangri La as is was more comfortable light and inimate with very nice lounges area with drinks and popular for what looked like a high tea with gorgeous little cakes - we enjoyed some tasy snacks there. The Four Seasons foyer is flashy but lacks some of the comfort. The pool area was indoors but quite nice- there was a terrace outdoors- and pleasantly warm compared to many pools we have been in. There is also a Day Spa on the same level- which we didn't have time to try. We had a wonderful romanic time in the immediate area- we tried a fairly inexprensive little bistro called Selah, reccommended by the concierge- he seemed to know his stuff- we double checked by Googling reviews and when we tried it the food and wine was genuinely good. We also found a nice harbour ferry trip- the more modern Cat ferry- trip out to Watsons Bay in the afternoon was an inexpensive way to get a nice tour of the pretty harbour side suburbs(without hitting the swells of the open sea as when you go to Manly Beach). The views back towards the city and bridge were spectacular and there was a nice large park there- you could almost take a picnic it was fabulous. There are also cute sandy little beaches at various ferry stops including there. There is a huge Doyles Seafood Restaurant that dominated the immediate pier (as well as fish and chippery) but there is no doubt the area is charming and the view back is stunning. We just love the harbour and central Sydney is a mix of sparkling water, big city views, green parks and gardens and pockets of preserved wilderness to the sea which is so pretty and unusual for a modern city- it is a delight just getting around!

The hotel is in a nice central location close to Circular Quay and the Bridge Climb. Yes, it is also in the Rocks, but we were unimpressed with that area overall. Plus, the hotel really wasn't very central in the Rocks, but kind of on the fringe. The location of the hotel itself is a challenge. If you have any mobility issues, I would recommend you look elsewhere for a hotel unless you plan on taking cabs the whole time. I guess I underestimated the hill everyone talked about, but at the end of the day of walking all around the city, that hill made getting to the hotel a bit of a challenge even if with the shortcut entrance at the back of the hotel. We did take a few cabs and it was a bit odd because except for when we arrived from the airport, the cab drivers told us they weren't allowed to drop off right at the hotel pull around, but had to go a bit past the hotel to a taxi area. We found that a bit strange and inconvenient at times. Lastly, the hotel is so popular for after dinner drinks up on the top floor that returning to the hotel between 5:30-6:30 was often a challenge because the elevators were always full.

However, a few things let it down. The service wasn't great: although we did get a room early, we had to wait ages for them to do a 'housekeeping sign-off' and then watched the room key be passed to some chatting receptionists who did nothing with it (despite us sitting half-asleep right in front of them) - in the end my husband had to wait in line behind others to ask for it. Then they took us into the wrong room at first (thankfully no one was there but we could see their unpacked suitcases on the floor!) and when we went for a nap in the correct room, someone opened the door while we were asleep! Not reassuring. They did apologise and give us a bottle of wine, but we weren't impressed. Although our stay was generally comfortable, it was the small things that annoyed us - you just expect more from a 5-star hotel. One evening, when we needed to get a taxi, the doorman said, 'oh, yes' and then promptly went to deal with other people arriving, so we had to wait for 15 minutes and were late to our restaurant.

The location is fantastic and right on the harbor. The rooms like a nice Marriott, with a nicer bathroom. Mini-Bar did not cool. Not sure if this is a common thing, but room temperature and water is not good. Restaurant views are great at Altitude on the 36th floor. The multi-course meal was good, but not great. The views are spectacular. For our honeymoon, they managed to put us in a room with two singles and said they were over-booked and we could not get the queen or king we requested. For these reasons, these guys will never compete with a Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental hotel. Room service was OK, but slow. It should be noted that the hotel has many views. If you stay here, get a true harbor view room of the bridge and Opera House. Otherwise, just have a meal at the restaurant--because the other views are not nearly as good.

So-So: Rooms, Internet Speed, Warm Mini-Bar, iHome stereo in room was OK. Bathroom was above average, lots of marble, but only one sink. Nice size TV, lots of Rugby channels (if you are in to that, as an American, Rugby seems random and zany.) Cons: Expensive for what you get. Non-Harbor view rooms are weak.

I am just a student with not a lot of money and I had been saving up to go on a holiday. I live in Melbourne and we were going to sydney for our first stop for one night. I had given my credit card details to shangri-la when booking online. When we got to the hotel, upon arrival they said they needed a card (didn't really specify why, were vague and said \"just incase\", I assumed it was just to take the details down in case of emergency or damages like at many other hotels), I hadn't brought my credit card to Sydney so I handed over my visa debit card with all of my holiday savings on it. When we were checking out they said they needed the card again to charge me for my room. I thought this was weird, I'd given them credit card details when I had booked, and I had given them another card to take down details on arrival, I told the girl that I had already given them my card upon arrival and she said that they hadn't charged it for the room then and that they needed the card to charge me now. So unfortunately I had to use my savings to pay for the room that I thought my credit card that I left in Melbourne would of covered online- I had wished they would specify online that they needed a card in person and I would have brought my credit card. The worst part starts now - a couple days later my card starts getting rejected saying I don't have enough money in my account, this is weird to me because the room cost was only $290 and I knew I still had some savings for my holiday. I check my bank account and see shangri-la had taken the $290 but there was $390 held on my account and it didnt say what for. I called up my bank and they said shangri-la had put that money on hold! I called shangri-la straight away and asked them why this was the case. They said they \"do it with everyone\" they take it as security and we get it back within a week. I don't know why they don't mention this ANYWHERE or why they didnt just take the cost of the room out of the amount they had already taken upon arrival! So overall shangri-la had taken about $700 of my savings (suffice to say I didnt have enough left to have an enjoyable holiday at all). When I got back from my holiday I still hadn't received the $390 back I had to call NUMEROUS times managers were always busy and had to \"call me back\" one of them never did call me back. One of them said he would deal with the problem asap (at about 9am and I called at 9pm and found out that his fax to the bank saying to let my funds go back to me hadnt worked and he had just left it there!) Eventually after a week, I got the money back, but I tell you what, it seems like so much of a hassle for them to take the money out and put it back in, they even have to send a fax to the bank every time they authorise for everyones money to get put back in - what a nightmare! Bottom line - if I was told that they would take the amount of my room plus an extra hundred on arrival, and then the amount of my room on departure I would have definitely 100% gone somewhere else. That is not something I can afford and I'm sure a lot of you guys would want to know this info when planning your trip if you don't have unlimited money like me!

We had booked 2 rooms and my husband and I were checking in the following day as we were spending the evening doing the roar and snore at the zoo. When we arrived the following day to check in we were again greeted by name and asked about our previous days activities. We were told at check in that we had been given a newly renovated room with harbour views. The rooms were spacious and well appointed, the window seat was nice when looking at the views. The only slight negative I would say about our room was that for a newly renovated room there were some details overlooked (tiles cracked in half on the bathroom wall or tiles missing from around the toilet, the in bathroom speaker not working) Also the shower was very dark due to the position it is placed. Service at the hotel was very good, staff were very polite and very helpful. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was good, although there was often a wait for eggs to be cooked or coffee to be delivered. We also ate at Alta restaurant and recieved excellent service as well as a wonderful meal. The same service was recieved in the bar next door. Turn down service was recieved each night with slippers placed by the bed and the fruit bowl replenished. We were dissapointed though not to recieved chocolates or bottled water at this time. One of the slight negatives about this hotel is the location. Although the views are amazing, the walk up the steep hill and steps at the end of a long day or evening was not welcoming. A further negative (one that we have not encountered when staying at any other Amex fine hotel that we have booked through Amex concierge) was that the bill had to be paid on the Amex card. This meant that I had to pay for my parents room and then sort out them paying us back. On our trip to Australia we stayed in 3 Amex fine hotels (plus we have stayed at several in the USA) and this was the only one we had to do this at. I would recommend this hotel as long as you don't mind the walk up the steep hill. Personally though I would probably not stay here again because of this.

He grew up here as a young boy and the mountains was his playground so he knew every crook and cranny and all the best views and photo opportunities. Next was bondi beach where as a young man he rode the surf. Here you can see the famous beach with the surfers attempting to ride the waves. Next on the list the magnificent botanical gardens were just amazing and his knowledge of animals/plant life was astounding. There is so much to see and do in sydney so having a tour guide with such knowledge was worth every penny. This guy to us off the beaten track.

Breakfast is always good but in my view too expensive as is the restaurant on the top floor very expensive as are the drinks so eat and drink elsewhere. On one trip i sustained a fractured shoulder boarding a water taxi (avoid them at all costs they did not even care that I was injured as a result of their ineptitude) The hotel staff on the other hand showed very real concern and wanted to call paramedics which I declined but insisted that at least their first aid person look at me. They were very caring and packed me in ice packs until my car arrived to take me to the airport, they even provided a sling. On my most recent visit the place was in blackout upon arrival due to a power failure and no one could check in. To their credit they swung into action providing canapes and drinks while we waited in and around reception. Finally checked in they upgraded me to a suite and apologised profusely for the delay. There were staff everywhere even escorting you to the lift and the floor where you were booked into. This hotel is a standout and is world class from a location, staff and comfort perspective, again the only thing is food and drinks quality and price.

We have stayed in most 5 star hotels in Sydney and I must say we were disappointed. We selected a Horizon Opera City View Room for this special occasion and were very happy with the canapes and drinks provided in the club lounge. The view was beautiful. Unfortunately the same could not be said for our arrival or room... On arrival I have never been to a 5 star hotel where you are not met by the concierge to help with bags, we had to lug out bags out of the taxi ourselves and then try and figure out how to get to the club room check in. This was not the welcome we expected. If looking at the website you will notice the view they show to advertise this room is a very clear one toward the opera house with the city off to one side. The only way we were able to see the opera house from our room was by sitting in the furthest corner of the window sill. Not exactly what we thought we had paid for. The other unfortunate and totally unacceptable element of our stay was when I took a knife to the fruit supplied in our room only to discover the apple was completely ROTTEN inside!! It smelt absolutely horrible. I am so glad I had not chosen to bite into this! When I then picked this up off the tray the base of the apple was completely rotten through and liquid had built up suggesting it had been there for a VERY long time.

The first stay was actually my first visit to Sydney. I picked this hotel because of its location to the major sights and reviews. The hotel does not disappoint. My only complaint was a potential noise problem with the room during my first stay. Even though we booked a Imperial Club room, we ended up in room 2910 which is the floor below the Club. Our room was actually directly underneath the main foot traffic area of the Club, and you could easily hear the noise from dress shoes, chairs being pulled out, etc. The more frequent noise was in the evening hours, especially on the weekend, when the Club was being used most. We were not in our room much during the day and evening hours so this did not bother us. However, you should avoid this room and those in the immediate proximity if daytime/evening quietness is a must. This is my only complaint. I got the impression that if we had complained to the hotel, they would have quickly accommodated us. On the flip side, this room had a tremendous view of the Sydney Harbour including the Harbour Bridge, Rocks, ferries, and Opera House. Apparently, the actual Club rooms don't have such a direct view because the Club itself has a multi-floor atrium occupying the space. Overall, the hotel rooms are quite spacious for a large city, and include all the amenities you could possibly need. Wireless internet is even included. If you can, spring for an Imperial Club room. There are great food presentations throughout the day as well as non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks. The Club is well staffed with very professional and courteous people. The Club has a dramatic, towering view over Sydney Harbour including the Bridge, ferry area, Rocks, and the Opera House. There is a private check-in/check-out service within the Club which is nice when the downstairs lobby gets busy. This was a great place to grab breakfast in the morning, and to relax after a long day of sight seeing or for pre-dinner cocktails. During the first stay, as mentioned, we did not have a \"Club room\" even though we had Club access. On the second stay, we did have a \"Club room\" located on the same floor as the Club entrance - the 30th floor. We had a great side view of part of the Harbour including the Opera House. There are some minor differences in the rooms such as upgraded amenities (espresso coffee and bathroom amenities). Otherwise, both rooms were equally comfortable. It is the amenities in the actual Club which make the higher price worth it. For a first time visiter, the location of the hotel to all of the major Harbour sights was priceless. We could easily walk to the Harbour Bridge, all of the pubs, shops, and restaurants in the Rocks district, the ferries, and the Opera House. Darling Harbour is an easy 10 minute walk. All of the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel, especially for those looking for an upscale hotel within walking distance to the major sights.

Check-in was fine and they noted that my Jade membership was not in the system. Received various other extras from booking through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts, except the room upgrade as they were fully booked. No hassle with that as I still believe you cannot rely on getting the upgrade. Biggest disappointment was the view from the room. Although it is described as an \"Opera House City View\", certainly our view was of the city and you needed to get right up to the window to see the Opera House to the left. I have to say the room description is a bit mis-leading - think they should swap the name around. If you want the harbour view, book a Grand Harbour View Room. The room itself was fine - stock standard five star style hotel fittings - very inoffensive. The bathroom is a great size with a separate bath and shower and lovely L'Occitane toiletries. The bed itself was very comfortable and resulted in a great night's sleep. The Horizon Club has a fantastic view but is looking a little bland and tired. Food offering at breakfast was adequate for a club flooe but the scrambled eggs were very powdery. Coffee was decent and good attention from the staff. Also visited during afternoon tea and was presented with a lacklustre selection of food which half way through started to look a little sparse! Thankfully the evening cocktails and canapes is a whole different experience. There is a great range of red and white wines on offer as well as spirits. The food is pretty good and refreshed often. The staff were wonderful and engaging making sure that drinks were topped up. We did try \"The Mix\" on level 1 for breakfast and it was very busy and crowded. Although a wider selection than the Club, it was not that different. I felt a bit sorry for the egg chef who was overrun with orders - perhaps two should be there on a busy weekend. It was a bit too noisy for us not helped by the fact it was school holidays. Also had dinner at Altitude 36 which was a delight. They have a four or seven course dinner menu on the weekends which is good value and more than enough food. There is also a great wine list. The service was both attentive whilst being unobtrusive and the view was once again, wonderful.

The hotel was really clean, modern, with good service and a great location, surrounded by many fabulous restaurants and bars, all within a 5-10 minute walk to the hotel. We had a large room with two beds - not quite singles but smaller than doubles - so it wasn't possible to actually sleep with my spouse. We were on business rates though and that was all that was left apparently. The view was decent, towards Darling Harbour.... I can imagine the other side of the hotel must have had stunning views towards Sydney Harbour. The hotel is located on the top of a very steep hill. Be warned, you can take the lift down a floor past the lobby and go out of an exit which alleviates you needing to walk up a (seemingly) 90 degree incline. We only realised this on our last few days - pushing our 2 year old up that hill in the push chair is probably the only reason I didn't gain weight during the visit! The hotel didn't have much of a vibe when we were there. It would have been nice to have something going on to make it feel like a place you wanted to relax after work.

My room was located on the 34th floor and it looked good at first glance. A hallway lead into the room and the bathroom and wardrobe was to the left. The room had a soft and light brownish carpet and the main item in the room was of course the bed with a golden bedspread. There were two chairs with a small table and on one of the walls there was a desk for working and a small desk that contained some fruits that I got and underneath was a small fridge. The wardrobe contained hangers, a safe and a robe. The bathroom was old school with yellowish tiles and patterns on the floor. But there was both a shower corner and a bathtub and the amenities included shaving kit, toothbrush, emery boards, bath salt etc etc. The shampoo and shower gel was very nice and I enjoyed them during my stay.

And from the hotel it is only a couple of minutes walk to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area and down to the harbor. We used the lounge quite a lot as we were working there after the regular work hours. The staff in the lounge on the 30th floor was just great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we experienced service that we normally just experience in Asian countries. A bit thank you to Emily, Jasmine, Jerry, Alexis and so on for being so generous to us. At night there is complimentary drinks and snacks from 6 to 8 and it is always a bit tempting to have some \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the stuff they had to eat was quite delicious so be careful to not eat too much if you want to enjoy a dinner later on. They were also very, very generous with the drinks and they had various wines to offer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but a word of advice to the staff: you should be careful calling the Australian sparkling wine for Champagne ;-). We also had breakfast in the lounge and they had a small selection of stuff that you need for breakfast there. We had to leave the hotel early one morning to fly back home and we left at 5.30 AM. When we came to the lobby they said that we could get the hotel car to take us for 50 AUD in a big BMW X6 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we used this offer as it was the same that we paid the taxi when going from the airport to the hotel. But there are always some things that can be improved. The lounge is located on the 30th floor and stretches up to 34th floor. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if this was the problem but it was more or less always freezing in the lounge and we were sitting around with jackets on. We told the staff several times but as it was central heating there was not much they could do about it. The lifts were also a bit moody \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some would read the cards to get to my level and some would not, some would indicate when arriving at a floor and some not. And I did not get the small things that I'm entitled to as a Jade member but it didn't really matter - I was just happy with the room upgrade. All in all this was a great hotel experience. The rooms might be a bit too old school for me but they seemed to be in good condition. I also enjoyed the view, the complimentary wi-fi in the room and lounge and the incredible staff in the lounge.

The location is perfect as it is only a 5 minute walk from Circular Quay. We also walked to Darling Harbour during the day which took about 20 minutes. There is a taxi rank directly outside the front entrance of the hotel if you dont want to walk at night. We had breakfast included in our stay. The breakfast was excellent. There was a great selection of breads, hams and cheeses, fruits, cerals and hot food. There was also omelettes made to order. You eat as much as you wanted. The staff here were excellent and after one day didnt even need to ask if you wanted tea or coffee and brought your preference from the day before. One issue with the breakfast is the fact that there are alot of business people here who think they are better than you. One morning we were seated at the window and we both got up to get our food. When we returned a woman and her dining partner had uprooted from their table and planted themselves in our seats even though our coffee was sitting there. Obviously the window table was not available when they came down. The staff were busy trying to get a table ready for us and kept apologising. This was not their fault...just 2 ignorant people who think they are above normal human beings. The staff at breakfast are excellent. The room we had was excellent. We had a great view over Circular Quay and the Opera House. The room was spacious and the The Bathroom was huge with a bath and a walk in shower. We even had a bottle of sparkling wine left in our room the first 2 nights of our stay. We used the spa one of the days. We just went for a quick swim and then spent 20 mins in the jacuzzi. There was people using the gym and this looked adequately equipped. The spa was very clean. I also used the sauna. My only complaint here would be that the sauna is not communal. My wife and I could not use it together. I had to access teh sauna through the mens changing room. I guess the females have their own also. We went for a drink to the Blu bar on the 36th floor. This is a must if even for one drink. We were lucky to get a seat at the window. The view is amazing. The setting is very fancy and modern, however the price for drink is very reasonable for Sydney which we found to be a very expensive city. We both had cocktails then I had a beer and the wife had a glass of champagne before we had to leave for dinner reservations. One complaint I would have would be the attitude of the member of staff who checked us out. After having excellent service all week from everyone...when we checked out I felt we were just discarded. As if there is no need for effort now as we are leaving. This was dissappointing.

They're not only friendly, but informative, smiley, professional and mostly very attractive looking! Only one trip up in our stay - we asked our concierge to find us a Japanese restaurant open for lunch on Saturday - I asked him to check on Sake Bar and Restaurant, which he did and said it was closed. We walked past it after lunching at Doyles, and it was open after all! We had lunch at Sake the next day and it was delicious (as was lunch at Doyles by the way).

Oh well not every room can have a great view and we did not pay for a harbor view, just a standard room. Plently of viewing was done from places all around Sydney, and not worth it to us to pay more for the room. Room: King bed, but this was definitely 2 mattresses pushed together. They were plush and comfy, but I could feel a bit of the divide in the middle (a dip!). Two sitting chairs and small table, desk and desk chair, large flat screen tv. Bathroom was amazing! Large sink, soaking tub, glass stall shower. Service: Concierge was helpful with directions to restaurants, shops, etc. Turn down service nightly in the rooms - yeah baby! Slippers and robes! Not chocolates but a Shangri La bookmark left on your pillow. Location: An excellent location in The Rocks, despite that hill! There are hills everywhere really, no way to avoid it. A little tough when you are done for the night and on your way back is all. We did cab it from the Opera house to the Shang one night for $10 (in the rain). Very convenient to the BridgeClimb center, a short walk down to Circular Quay. Blu Bar on 36th Floor: Upscale, expensive drinks, but excellent views! Had to wait a few minutes for a table to open up but there is a standing bar area if no lounge tables are available. Overall: Great location, great service! Highly reccomend!

I stayed yesterday for my birthday and mothers day and our experience was fabulous we couldn't wait to tell our family and friends about our stay. We had a corner room on the 26th floor room 2613. When I saw the number 13, I was a little shaken but when we walked down the hall of our room we just couldn't believe our eyes the view was everything I hoped for and more we could see both the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House and all the way up and down the harbour. Yes it is beside a freeway as the previous reviewer stated and up a hill but at no time did I hear any noise inside the hotel and we swam in the pool (indoor)which is directly beside the so called freeway and ate breakfast beside the expressway still no outside noise. Yes it is up a hill but I am overweight and 55 and didn't mind the walk because as the hotel is up that same hill is the reason we had such a superb view. People from all over the world hope they will be able to see those views when they come to Sydney we live here and have dreamed of that view and yesterday we got it. Our package was on first inspection very expensive but we wanted something special so we took a package that cost A$578 Premier Grand Harbour View Celebration but it came with breakfast, valet parking, Moet Champagne and $150 food and beverage pack we sipped champagne over a couple of hours in our room had cocktails and a plate of olives and fetta in the bar on the 36th floor whilst listening to a three piece band. We then went down to our room to enjoy the night views and order a romantic room service meal of lamb cutlets (delicious)with more wine from the mini bar served yes beside the window and yes those views. I don't know the level of the other reviewers room but the hotel web site is quite truthful our room was exactly how it was pictured it was spotless the bathroom the same I had a relaxing bath as well as a shower during our stay without problem I don't know if our room has been renovated I don't really believe so as the bathroom was quite conservative. All the staff we interacted with where friendly and helpful we have just returned from Asia in March and we both agreed that this stay although very short was really enjoyable and no long travelling when we broke down all the cost we realised our room only cost around $200 after all the extras were taken out a bargain really for a five star hotel. I am going to recommend this hotel to others just choose the room type carefully there a a number that have Circular quay harbour views and they differ in prices.

The lobby area is very extensive and welcoming and includes some quiet outdoor space as well as some complimentary internet access computers. There is a large gym and a medium size indoor pool with some outdoor lounge chairs next to the pool. One can really enjoy the facilities of this hotel. One of the best restaurants in Sydney is on the 36th floor of the hotel, Altitude, and it is highly recommended for the great food but also because you can enjoy what I believe would be just about the best views in Sydney. Only the front facing rooms of the hotel would also have this completely stunning view (if booking, these would be the \"grand harbour\" rooms). There are lots of touristy shops and cafes nearby if you walk down the stairs out the back of the hotel from the lower ground floor, worth a wander but most of the cafes are ordinary; it is worth making your way to the Fine Food Store inside The Rocks shopping centre; less than 10 minutes walk from the Shangri-La for an excellent breakfast or lunch and great coffee.

First 1/2 of the hotel rooms overlook a 12 lane highway, a dock and the water in the background. The highway sound comes in especially at night and I was on the 12th floor. The other side looks over a 4 lane road. The old infrastructure does not work even with the cosmetic changes. I have lots of examples here are a few - I complained 3 times to have the heat turned on. I slept with 2 blankets and the robe on to keep warm each of the three nights. Every time it was fixed it switched back to AC only. The shower head fell down so it was at shoulder height. They fixed it twice never stayed up. They charged $165 for checking in early at 10Am which I will dispute. The hotel is a steep hike from anywhere since it is surrounded by highways. The people that have only 2 reviews on this hotel are obvious plants.

The Room Easy to access, well laid out. The welcoming note was a nice touch (even if it is a form letter someone still has to sign it and address it). As was the fruit and water.

This is the sort of bed that makes you just want to stay in it. Comfortable, luxuriant, crisp sheets (but not hospital like) comfortable and inviting.

I've been trying different 4 and 5 star hotels to see which one I want to give my regular business to. I'd heard great things about The Shangri-La and was hoping it would live up to the Shangri-La property in Singapore. Big mistake. Despite requesting a non-smoking room, I was given a smoking one. It STANK! OMG...how disgusting. I was told that was all they had available and what was I to say?? The room was a good size, but starting to look a little chipped and dated. It wasn't terrible, but just little things I noticed. The bathroom was fabulous! Lovely deep bath and a large separate shower with plenty of shelves for all those bottles and things you need while bathing. Very nice. Unfortunately, the curtains hadn't been as well designed as the bathroom and I found a lot of light came in through the top and bottom. Not a good night's sleep. The gym in the property is good and better than a lot of other ones in the 4 and 5 star properties around town. Definitely recommend that. The most disappointing part of my say was the service. It was a real let down. At about 8.30pm, I realised I'd run out of teabags and sugar in the room. I called and requested more of each. About half an hour went by and nothing. So I called again. Yes, they would bring them up I was told. Another 20 mins went by and I called yet AGAIN, only to be told they were 5 mins away. Yet another 20 mins went by and I was told \"They are 2 mins away!\" Finally, a further 17 mins later (I'd given up at this point!) there was a knock on the door and my teabags and sugar was delivered. I realise that Saturday nights can be busy in a hotel, but almost an hour and a half for teabags and sugar???? Really??? Unfortunately, I have another booking at this hotel in a Horizon Club room next month. If I hadn't pre-booked and paid, I'd be taking my custom somewhere else.

I went to the hotel weeks beforehand and Guest Services talked me through the various rooms and showed me what the rooms where like, and recommended the Horizon Club Deluxe Harbour View Room. At $800+ the room isn't cheap, but for a special one night occassion (in this case proposing to my now fiancee), it was worth it. Staff at the hotel from the general staff to those on the Horizon Club levels were fantastic, friendly and helpful. Guest services organised a turn down service and the ring to be left in the room whilst we were out at dinner. Best of all she said yes :), so the Shangri-La holds a special place in my heart. The views are stunning. Second to none and the huge windows and harbour facing bed mean you sleep with the blinds open, taking in the beauty of Sydney Harbour. The room is spotless, and bathroom is huge and lined with Le-Occitane essentials. A bottle of wine welcomed us, and the bed was one of the best I've slept in at a hotel. It was like sleeping on a cloud. I've stayed at many places in Sydney, quite a few high end 5 star places, and the Shangri-La definitely stands up there with the best in all areas.

I find the staff so amazingly friendly, always helpful and a genuine pleasure to liaise with. It has a view to die for, and if you are able to get a Harbour View room then theres not alot more you could want. One thing i do love about this hotel is that 2 out of the 3 times we have stayed we have gotten straight off a cruise ship at 9am in the morning and both those times the room has been ready. So rare to be able to get a room that early but Shangri La always accommodates. An added bonus is the new huge LCD TV screens. They are massive!!! This reason alone will have us coming back. Regrettably there were 2 things that let it down slightly this time. 1 was the stained bedhead. It was truly disgusting. We are talking about a bed head covered in what i counted to be 8 large stains. I did report it and the staff were gracious in their response but the point being is that at $400 a night, this should not have been an issue. I wouldn't expect this from a 3 star hotel let alone a 5 star. The other although minor point is the room service service charge of $6 every time you order. Now i have stayed at alot of 5 star hotels, more so in Victoria, i have not come across this before and am quite certain last we stayed here that this service charge didnt apply. I just think after paying $64 for 2 hamburgers and chips, why is it necessary to add on another $6 charge. Other than that, this hotel makes you feel special and our experience shows that they will go out of their way to look after you. A handy hint for people booking in advance. I had originally booked a harbour view room at $470 a night, every day i would check their website and noticed the rate dropping. I just cancelled the booking and rebooked. It went from $470 to $450 then to $400 over 2 weeks, so just because you have a rate locked in, keep checking the site. You may be surprised. Anyway, of course we will return, i just hope the hotel can be a little more proactive in keeping those bedheads clean", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wellington", "Title": "\u201cGreat views, but tired and dated room\u201d", "Author": "kzw4nc", "ReviewID": "UR97227824", "Content": "Paid $AU545 per night for Horizon Premier Grand Harbour View Room.

It is really a very very good hotel. I really rate this hotel at 4.5 currently because of one small observation about the Lobby Lounge which I will get into later. But I rated this hotel at 4 previously, so now with my 5, I guess it averages out! Overall - Okay, I booked during what looked like an extremely busy weekend. When I arrived there were a lot of people checking in. I did not get a room straight away as it was before check in time, but that was ok, I still managed to get into my room before check in time. Staff are very friendly, especially the bell captains and concierge. Room - I got a city side room this time (not like the spectacular grand harbour view before), but the view is fine. Rooms are clean, everything in working order and quite luxuriously appointed. Also the rooms are quite large. Still LOVE the fast FREE internet access. Housekeeping was prompt. In room dining - Room service food quality was good and service prompt. Food was fresh and tasty. Blu Bar and Altitude - Excellent! The views from up there are truly amazing. Blu Bar was crowded even at opening time, but service was good. We had an early dinner at Altitude and the food was lovely. Restaurant staff are excellent. The restaurant does not have many tables, so it provides a nice quiet intimate atmosphere and you can't beat the view. We had the set 4 course meal. Started with the oysters (superb), rabbit terrine (not my thing but glad I tried it), steak (very nice) and the cheese platter. Lobby Lounge - While the service was friendly, I think it is slightly understaffed. Just an observation. Went there twice. Chi Spa - Fantastic. Very relaxing. I didn't go back to Cafe Mix or the gym this time, so I can't comment whether there were any improvements. Other - The Shangri-La management is extremely responsive to any comments you have on the hotel. Very impressed.

It has long been a gripe of mine that while hotels enjoy more benefits of credit card use than most other industries (booking guarantees, pre-authorisations, charging for no-shows, charging for late charges, avoiding large cash transactions), the industry has been one of the most bullish industries in Australia to introduce credit card surcharges, and that most major groups have magically chosen exactly the same percentage to surcharge.

The room was very well appointed and the bed extremely comfortable. There was a huge marble bathroom (with ample room for the baby's portacot!) . There was also an extra toilet off the main entrance which is a nice touch. Because of the suite, we were automatically given access to the Horizon Lounge on level 30. Good breakfast up there, as well as canapes and drinks. The staff, especially on the Horizon level were very friendly & great with our kids. We actually had breakfast downstairs in Cafe Mix which was a pretty good breakfast - it is great that they have a chef to cook everyone's eggs just as they like them. The pool is lovely, nothing fancy but well heated and with a spa. Things that could be improved: 1. the Shangri-la number that I called to make the reservation: the woman on the other end of the phone while very helpful had an inferior grasp of the English language. This made the booking process quite frustrating. In the end, she still got my email address wrong despite dictating it multiple times to her and I had to call the following day to get this rectified when no confirmation email arrived. The next day, there was another woman on line who was no better at English. I think an international hotel needs to think about hiring those more proficient at English - it was hard enough for a native speaker to understand what was being said. 2. I rang down to concierge to inform them I had a friend coming to the hotel and to enquire what the procedure was to get them access to our floor. The response of the concierge bordered on rude and patronising ( i think he was busy, but no excuse). He said, \"there are SO many people in the lobby and over 3 different desks. There is no way we know who YOUR friend is.\" ...blah blah in a very impatient tone & he missed the point of what I was asking. But overall, a lovely stay.

Reservations were a nightmare, losing information eand charging the credit card twice. We complained, and from then on were treated brilliantly. Personal check-in, upgraded room, free bottle of bubbly. The management genuinely seemed to want to make ammends. On arrival check in went well (one manager tried to be a little too helpful and should have just let her competent staff get on with it rather than interfering!) and the room was a great. Large, clean and (due to upgrade) views of bridge and opera house from the bed! Service was top notch: reception, concierge, room service and maid service. Importantly all the staff spoke English well (so often not the case) and so requests were understood. As an indicator of the quality of service we mentioned that the mattress was too soft for us and was there anything they could do - yup, they could and swapped our mattress for a firmer on (pillows too). Room service meal was very good, the cocktail bar at the top was also first class, and the spa was great with professional staff. Couple of downsides: while the hotel is very centrally located near circular quay, it is up a short, but quite steep hill. Walking to c/quay is easy, walking back the hill is just a touch annoying. Secondly, on our second morning (bearing in mind we went for long lie ins without the kids) an arriving cruise ship woke us at 7ish sounding its horn! Obviously it is not a small, personalised, hotel where every guest is greeted by name and individual preferences are noted. It is the opposite end of that scale.

Early check-in that had been requested did not happen, had to wait in Horizon Club for 2 hours whilst previous guests checked out - no problem. Room 3113 was commented on by many staff as one of the best and it certainly was. Simply stunning views over Harbour Bridge and Opera House - incredible experince as you lie in bed whether at night or in the morning. Room was fine - only comment is no iPod docking station - however the room was well presented and spacious. Tip: the Hoizon Club complimentary breakfast is very good - so in hindsight you probably do not need to book a 'with breakfast' inclusive rate. However the buffet at the Cafe Mix on 1st floor is very very good (and should be for AUS$44 a head!). Other points: No outdoor pool - but hey, you have Bondi beach 20 mins down the road! Too much chlorine in the pool for my liking. Good gym. Don't forget to ask for beach towels each day if you are heading out (they dont mention this). Valet parking is worth doing if you use your car more than once per day. Free wifi - but a really poor signal. Why is it in the 21st century major hotels cant get WiFi right - they either charge the earth or its really poor. Needs fixing, quick!

Having got married in Sydney Nov 2007 and spent our anniversary there in 2008 we wanted to go back for Christmas and New Year. We had booked a little late which meant we had to change rooms halfway through our stay. The first 5 nights we had in an executive grand harbour view suite which we had had when we got married. These rooms are on the corner of the hotel and come with a small hallway with a w/c, a lounge with views over the majority of the harbour, a large bedroom with dual aspect views from the harbour bridge to the heads from one side and Darling Harbour to Parramatta the other side, a large bathroom with shower and bath and separate w/c with views over Darling Harbour. The second 5 nights we had in a deluxe grand harbour view room. These are large rooms with great views to the North overlooking the Bridge, Opera House and most of the harbour. We also enjoyed the Horizon Club while we were there. This basically means you get access to the 30th floor club lounge at any time where you can have breakfast, soft drinks throughout the day and then alcoholic beverages and canapes in the evening. You can also check in and out there which is a bit more intimate than reception. For us it is the Horizon Club that makes this place a must for us when we visit Sydney. The staff are generally excellent and sitting in the window looking over the Bridge and Opera House with endless sparkling wine for a couple of hours in the evening before going out to dinner is great. There are several members of staff that we think deserve a mention. Sabina (Horizon Club Manager), Lin, Jerry and Melanie (Horizon Club) and Ashley (Front Office Manager). I won't go into detail but Sabina and Ashley sorted out a problem we had and were both extremely helpful with a few other things, Melanie was the most attentive member of staff in the Horizon Club always serving with a smile and Jerry is someone who is essential to a good hotel. He knows everything. He has been working at the hotel for a very long time and as such is very good at looking after you and being able to give advice on anything Sydney from where to go for dinner to which beaches are good at what times. He is also very attentive during service and makes sure glasses are topped up right until the end! Basically our likes are: Location- Right in the heart of things in the Rocks although a steep climb from George Street. Great views. The rooms- well presented and a very good size. Great views if you pick the right rooms. Horizon Club- Some excellent staff, great sparkling wine, great views. Dislikes: The canapes in the Horizon Club are not always great. The service at breakfast downstairs is usually lacking with most of the staff seemingly not particularly happy to be there. Breakfast food quality is sometimes a little lacking downstairs.

Overall, I had a great experience. It is a luxury hotel in a fantastic location with beautiful views. Yes, it is expensive, but it delivers. I have only one complaint regarding check-in (see below). Pros: - location: great location next to the Rocks and a stone's throw from the Sydney Opera House. The Harbor bridge, the Kiribilli area just to the north and the downtown are all extremely close (walking distance). If you have time, take half an hour to an hour to get to the beaches (anywhere between Bondi and Coogee is gold). It just doesn't get any better. - rooms: plush, comfortable, large. Beautiful views. Free fast wi-fi in the room (complimentary, I believe). A pre-printed jogging map with different routes provided in every room. Great fitness center on premises with a fairly large pool on-site as well. - service: overall, wonderful. Super friendly, fast, informative. The concierge helped me out a lot. Cons: - check-in. This is my main gripe. Most international flights get in between 6am and 8am. I got in on the 6am flight and was at the hotel at 7am. I was informed that the hotel was fully booked, so I would have to wait 6-7 hours for a room. After 30+ hours of travel, I did not enjoy spending a few hours in the lobby (until my laptop & phone died; no juice in the electric plugs in the lobby) and then a few more hours wandering the streets of Sydney (about 10 mile walk). I came back around 1pm and was told again the room was not ready. I mentioned that I have been waiting since 7am. After a call to housekeeping I found out the room had been ready for 4 hours and was checked in right away. I understand the hotel is often fully booked. But there has got to be a better way to make international travelers feel welcome. There was at least a few dozen people in the same convention with the same problem. One solution could be charging guests for guaranteed early check-in (for a fee of, say, 1/2 the nightly room rate). Or at least providing a small shower room on premises (perhaps next to the toilets in the lobby floor) - a place to quickly clean up and change. - The fitness center closes at 9pm. I would prefer it closed later (perhaps 11pm-midnight) so I could get my workout in after dinner / when jet lagged. Overall, I had a great stay. Except for the check-in experience, everything was smooth, the service was friendly and fast. I would definitely stay here again.

I looked carefully at the photographs online of the rooms, so that I could choose a really lovely one for our special celebration. I also notified the hotel by email that it was an important occasion for us, and to do their best in allocating us a nice room. Imagine my disappointment then, when our Deluxe Grand Harbour View Room, which was supposed to have a luxurious view over the Opera House, Harbour, Quay and Harbour Bridge, ...faced north-nor west, and had a cracking view over the CAHILL EXPRESSWAY! Yes, you could see the South Pylon of the bridge. Yes,...if you sat on the window ledge and peered around the corner, you could see the quay and opera house. The bed didn't even face the right way to get the view from the window. You had to be sitting on the ledge. I was very disappointed in room 1308. 13th Floor. I had asked previously if we could have a nice room, on a high floor. I didn't want an upgrade, I just wanted it to be similar to the photo. Nice. Was it? No. It must have been the worst of their so-called Deluxe Grand Harbour View Rooms, on the lowest floor. I even range to check that it was the right kind of room, and to ask if we could change but were given a resounding 'no', due to the hotel being filled to capacity. How early do you have to book? and who do you have to be? to be able to book a room, and get what we paid for and what the website advertises? It was ONLY a 50th Birthday afterall. If the package deal rooms are nothing like the pictures, then they should say so. Since we couldn't change, we tried to enjoy it. The full view could only be enjoyed by sitting on the ledge, or in the single chair in the corner, since the view faced a different way to the window. From the bed (where at least we could sit together as there was only one chair) you could only see the old buildings on the south side of the harbour bridge and a bit of highway. mmm.... not exactly Grand Deluxe anything. the carpet was dingy, and the room quite small. It's design, as I said, seemed wrong, the bed facing away from the view in the window. The phone was on the blink. I had to make 3 calls, and all three had the recipients saying they couldn't hear me and I had to ring back a few times until I got them. It was very frustrating. I noticed no one said 'you have a brummy phone, I'll send someone up to replace it. ' Not even the concierge. The bathroom was huge, and lush, and the amenities and toiletries very nice. But you don't sleep in the bathroom. The prime reason for choosing this hotel was the view and the room. It did not impress. The champagne that came with the package was lovely, and the breakfast in the Cafe Mix the next morning really great. They have the BEST pancakes in the universe in that place...however, they rarely seemed to have them out, twice I had to ask the cook/chef to make some. (yes I went back for seconds, yum!) The egg cook was very inattentive, and kept mucking up the poached eggs. It was also VERY busy, and the queue after us really long. Be at breakfast by 9am on a sunday if you want a table, we got one just in time, others after us had to wait a long long time. We had drinks at Blu Bar. why is that Bar so small????? It took 30 mins of our 40 to get the drink. Too small for the amount of people who want to visit. But a nice view if you can get a seat. We had dinner on the Saturday night at Altitude, what great staff! They, at least, listened to my birthday request 4mths earlier, and we got a lovely table by a window with a view to die for. We were surprised by the weird menu, which we did not realise was not a regular a la carte. It was a set 4-5 course (but not degustation) menu, for a set price. I prefer a la carte. The food was quite good. The scallop tortellini was divine, the mulloway with squid ink a bit weird for my taste - I didn't think wilted greens (tasted like spinach) went very well with fish and weird black sauce. The service was sensational, the attention perfect. The view of things lovely and we even got fireworks off the opera house (maybe someones wedding?). The bed was divine. The beautiful pillow top and lovely down pillows are just heavenly. I wish I could have brought it home! Checkout was fairly fast, and as I have mentioned to the hotel, but with no satisfactory resolution, we did NOT get Qantas Frequent Flyer points for our stay. The package, apparently did not qualify. The Altitude restaurant DID qualify, as it was not part of the package, but since we were told to put it on our tab, it disqualified us from QFF points there too. Stingy, tricky, and just a bit dodgy I reckon. Overall the breakfast and the comfy bed was the best part of it. We are not that rich that I would risk so much money again ($660 for the package) on such a low floor room that did not match the photos.

We've stayed at Shangri-La's in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. We swear by the brand and recommend it above all others. I rate the Shangri-La Singapore way above Raffles. But this? Here's a crash course in how to damage your corporate image - you whack up a tower block in Sydney and hope no one will spot the fact that you've recreated a three star budget outlet and stuck a posh logo on the top to make it look OK from a distance. Where do you start? The rooms. Lets get one thing straight. You can't sleep in a bathroom. OK, you can make it look good but if it's adjoined to a dimly lit prison cell, you won't fool anyone. The drab walls, dubious \"art work\" and frayed carpet are a big no-no if you want to be five star. The bed. This deserves its own star billing. I'm not sure which garage sale it came from but the way it sagged and wallowed could only imply it had played a supporting role in the conception of Luciano Pavarotti's hitherto undiscovered love child. My wife slept on the join (yes, King Size means two singles gaffa-taped together) as it was the firmest place above floor height! Guilty until proven innocent. OK, so I'm used to a mini bar tariff. I'm also used to prices so exorbitant they could feature in a remake of the \"Merchant of Venice\". Where I start to lose it though, is when you're given a price list for the little jotting pad, the guest services directory and the (I presume at the price gold leafed, calf-hide bound) entertainment guide cover. Does their typical guest swipe anything that isn't nailed down? Room 2406. This gets its own accolade for the gushing noise that rushes through it day and night. Traffic? No. Wind? possibly. Air con? who knows. Lift mechanics? By the third day we assumed this to be the case. Avoid at all costs! And the ultimate crime? They lost or stole our Moomin. A Moomin is a small furry creature from Finland. It is (or was), yellow, about 20cm tall and although only worth about AUD10, was of great personal value. In years of travel throughout the world nothing - NOTHING - has ever gone missing from a hotel room. But in spite of repeated enquiries I suspect the funny furry creature has been skinned barbecued and served up with a slice of emu pate. Don't get me wrong - there were some good points, Jimmy the doorman was excellent and Troy the concierge most helpful. But taken as a whole, I have to ask how long before Shangri-La ditch this one and sell it on to Best Western or Formula 1. It certainly doesn't do justice to such a premium brand.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cThe Shangri-La rocks in The Rocks!\u201d", "Author": "sagelilac", "ReviewID": "UR83779590", "Content": "We spent our first three days in Sydney at the Shangri-la hotel as we had rented in an apartment in Potts Point for the rest of our vacation, and we ended up wishing we had stayed at the hotel for the whole time.

We booked a room for 3 adults as we were bringing our disabled adult daughter with us. On booking in, the lady at reception indeed noted that we were staying 2 nights with 3 guests. She then asked if we wanted another bed put in the room! We asked how many beds were there already in the room and she answered, one king bed. Did she expect the 3 of us to share a bed!!! Anyway we insisted that we needed another bed. Shortly after getting to our room the bed appeared. We then asked for an extra towel as a third person had not been catered for (Even though we had booked in advance for 3 people). Some time later extra towels and toiletries arrived. I decided to make us all a cup of coffee only to find 2 cups and NO coffee with only enough milk for 2. Another call to housekeeping. Coffee and milk arrived. I made the coffee to discover only 1 sugar sachet....I should have taken an inventory of everything at the beginning. So as not to harrass housekeeping again we drank our coffee with sweetener (which was provided). I decided to get my daughter organised for bed to discover that they hadn't delivered any pillows to go with the extra bed!!! Yet another call to housekeeping. I thought this was supposed to be a 5 star hotel!!!!! Similar dramas happened at dinner..... the restaurant was extremely busy and the staff were run off their feet. We were seated at a table designed for 2 a tight squeeze at the best of times but more so for us as we did have a wheelchair to accomodate too! It would have been easier all round if they had told us that the restaurant was booked out and they couldn't accomodate us. We had items of cutlery missing, and one waiter left an awful smell of body odour every time he went past...not pleasant when we were trying to eat. Breakfast was similiar to dinner, we were shown to a table for 2 with only cultery etc for 2 people but assured that another setting would appear, which didn't happen until I had to ask again some time later. We were not offered coffee or tea or told how the buffet worked etc and had to find a waiter to ask how we go about getting tea and coffee. There were no glasses for the juice, several of the juice jugs were empty, and no museli until a few of us asked. The list goes on. I have never experienced such terrible attention to detail and poor customer service at any 5 star hotel I have ever stayed in before. in spite of all of this the room was lovely. We booked again for dinner on the Sunday night (I know that was foolish) but it was much quieter and we had a lovely meal served to us at a table catering for 4 people , with cutlery intact Yay! Service was great but again bowls of salad at the salad bar were sitting there empty and we had to ask if there was any more, to which they immediately responded. We shouldn't have to ask, the bowls should just be regularly filled. This was our first and will be our last stay at the Shangri La.. In all honesty this comedy of errors probably wouldn't happen again, and may well be a one off but I wouldn't risk staying here again.

It is one of the few hotels that offer that. In this day and age I find it mind boggling that hotels charges upwards of $30 a day for internet access. The location of the hotel is a little out of the way. It's a nice walk, but can be a little spooky for a single girl walking back from the Rocks at night, as there are a lot of quiet alleyways. I did quite a quick dash one night to get back to the hotel quickly because it was really dark. Some people might have difficulty walking back to the hotel because it is an uphill climb, but I loved it. The slight seclusion of the hotel also meant that it was quiet, which is very important to me. The main complaints were not with the room but with the facilities. The gym is quite basic, and certainly nothing like some of the other Shangri-la gyms that I have been to. The other complaint is to do with the restaurant. The service staff seemed a little out of their element as I had to request for things several times. The restaurant was about half full. The bread I got at the start was stale. And the quality of the meal was really average for the price. I expected better for a hotel of this calibre. But not really an issue as the Rocks is a short walk away with some brilliant restaurants.

The pool & spa (indoors), gym and sauna are excellent. I really wished I had bought my gym shoes so I could sneak in a workout on the treadmill and exercise bike!

Well I'm glad we made a good choice, we stayed in the Deluxe Grand Harbour view room and it was very spacious and clean. Clean bathrooms are a must for me, and the bathroom was nicely lit up with a shower, bathtub and a huge mirror and scales! I didn't find the scales useful as I'm no athlete!

However I was let down by the lack of variety they offered. Of course they had the staples such as hash browns, eggs, toast, cereal and some asian styled congee but their pastry section was small and overall it was defintely lacking. I also love a good selection of fresh juices and coffees but once again they did not have much variety.

The non-Horizon Club rooms, even those in higher room categories are a disgrace, clearly have not been renovated or updated in the last ten years, and would barely rank as 2.5-stars. Given the disparity between rooms at the same hotel, you can see why I call the Shangri-La a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tale of Two Hotels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those people who get a newly renovated room should be pleased. Those that get stuck with the older non-renovated rooms will be sorely disappointed. We arrived at the Shangri-La on a Saturday night, looking forward to staying in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 five star hotel after nearly two weeks of touring in New Zealand. We had booked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a Grand Deluxe Harbor View Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nearly a year in advance, specifically requesting a high floor room. Upon check-in, I noticed the room we were offered was only on the fifth floor (of this nearly 40-story hotel). Given the low floor, I was worried the view would be obstructed and asked the clerk to provide us with a room on a higher floor. He said the hotel was full, and that the room on the fifth floor was the only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grand Deluxe Harbor View Room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But not to worry, the view would be unobstructed. With some reservation, we went to room, opened the door were ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED and SORELY DISAPPOINTED with what greeted us. The ceiling was falling down where water had leaked from above, and the ceiling was moldy (see picture). The chair was threadbare (see picture). The TV was a big tube TV straight from the 1980s (see picture). The room overlooked the roadway, and the windows were so dirty and obstructed that we could barely make out the Opera House and Harbor Bridge. The windows were so dirty I initially thought they were fogged (like after steam from a shower)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno, they were just very dirty. Given its sad state, this room was neither \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nor \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nor, given the dirt-covered windows did it have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Harbor View.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Do not be misled, as I was, into thinking that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grand Deluxe Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (I can only be fearful of what state a non-\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grand Deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room at this hotel would be like, since this one was so sorry). I immediately called down and after speaking with the front desk, the manager agreed to show us two other rooms (funny that the clerk checking us in failed to mention these other clearly available rooms). The front desk quickly sent a clerk who took us to see two other rooms. The first was on the 16th floor and was not much better than the first. The second was a Horizon Club room on the 34th floor with only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153partial harbor view.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Walking into the Horizon Club room, we wondered if we were in the same hotel. The difference was night and day. To their credit, the hotel should be commended for sending a staff member to escort us to see two other rooms. The Horizon Club room was clean, well-appointed and had clearly been renovated recently. The TV was modern, the window was clean, and the furnishings were not worn threadbare. While this room had only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153partial harbor view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we could see the Opera House (though not the Harbor Bridge). Even this room had some details that were a bit off for a hotel that bills itself as five-star. For example, there were hotels in the wall that had not been correctly patched (see photo). These minor detail issues aside, this room was so much better than the first that there was little room for complaint. We had dinner in the Altitude Restaurant on the top floor of the Shangri-La. The views were absolutely stunning and the food was top-notch. Be forewarned, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need reservations well in advance. Whether staying at the Shangri-La (or elsewhere) you should stop in to Altitude for dinner. The views alone are worth it. Before dinner, we went to the bar on the top of the hotel and had a drink. Unlike the view at Altitude, the bar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view is nothing to write home about. In sum: If you can get a newly renovated room on a high floor (even with only a partial view) you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be happy. If you get stuck with an old non-renovated room, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be sorely disappointed. And do NOT be misled into thinking that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grand Deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room promises to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cRoom starting to show some wear and tear ... and need some TLC\u201d", "Author": "ShibaInus", "ReviewID": "UR64252557", "Content": "Haven't been back to to the Shangri-La Hotel, Sydney in quite a few years and had the pleasure of staying there this week.

The harbor views are great if your willing to pay the premium to get them. I booked a room for three nights, april 23-26th (fri-mon). On booking I requested a king bed, but on check in was told that only twin beds were available in the rate I had booked at. Offered me to upgrade to a better view room with a king bed for $40 more per night. As I really prefer a larger bed I asked about the club rooms as a option. This would be a better view, king bed, breakfast, and use of horizon club. This was $80 more per night and figured I'd give it a shot. Room was fairly large and nicely appointed, but nothing special especially for a 5 star establishment. Bathroom was large with separate shower and large soaking tub. Room included internet (all rooms do here) but only wired in the room. Wifi was available in public spaces only. I was in room 3417, which did have great views of the opera house and harbor. Bed was very disappointing as it was two twins connected together and was easy to tell by lying on the bed. I realize that this may be common practice, but again my initial purpose for upgrading was for a king bed. Whatever they used to connect the bed made it very uncomfortable to sleep across this area and I ended up huddled up on on side or the other. Horizon club was nice. They had drinks and appetizers from 4-6pm nightly, and you could have breakfast there in the morning (limited menu from buffet downstairs). There was newspapers, wifi, and non-alcoholic drinks available throughout the day. Staff here was very friendly and helpful with some good places to get some pictures. I ate breakfast at the buffet each morning since it had a wider selection than the club, including made to order eggs, omelets, and pancakes. Food was the same every day including fruit, yogurt, bread selection, cheese, meat tray, cereal, juices, egg station, bacon, ham, hash brown wedges, miso, chinese noodles, & roasted tomatoes. Food was good quality, but not overly exciting. If you don't like your eggs runny, you really need to make this clear when ordering made to order eggs. Twice in three days I ordered 2 eggs over medium and got runny whites. Not really a problem in that they remade them to my liking, but still a service issue. Plus, if you pay for the buffet it was $38. Gym was decent with several cardio machines and weight center. Pool was small, supposedly heated, but was too cold for my liking. All in all a very nice hotel with good views if your willing to pay for the upgrades. Unless breakfast is included in your room rate I would eat elsewhere.

When we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that there was no twin bedded rooms available despite our confirmation and we were told to return later while they sorted something out. Upon returning, we were told by the man at the desk that there was a twin bedded room available for us but it was still occupied and it would be at least 2 hours before we could check in. He also mentioned that there was a king room he could move us into immediately. I asked if we could check into this room and then relocate into the twin room when it became available. He informed me that would be fine and that he would let us know when it would be possible to move. After spending a couple of hours in this room with no word from reception I rang and asked them when we would be moving into the twin room. They had not heard anything about it and proceeded to me they did not have any twin rooms available. After explaining our situation they eventually told me that the best they could do for us was to move us into a larger king room with a rollaway bed on a higher floor and with a better view. We accepted their offer though we thought it was strange how the twin bedded room promised to us earlier had simply disappeared. We wondered if it was actually reserved for us in the first place. Once we had relocated to the new room 2 bottles of champagne had been brought up to make up for the inconvenience. Though we were very annoyed by these problems which spoiled our first day in Sydney, our stay at the Shangri-La was pleasant from then onwards. The hotel itself is beautiful, the room was gorgeous with an amazing view of the harbour, the bed was extremely comfortable and breakfast was nice. The only minor problem with the hotel is its location on a hill, which is a steep climb to the top (though the views from the rooms are worth it).

If it couldn't get worse, when I presented myself to Chi-Spa for my massage the next day - I was told they had no record of my booking and was turned away without any suitable explanation. When I came up to my room and found my email confirmation, I rang down to the spa again to see if they could find my booking. Was fobbed off my the reception staff with alternative times (none of which were suitable) and no explanation was offered. I had read the previous reviews about this hotel which mention dated rooms, old fashioned TVs, etc - but all this could be overlooked if the service had not been lacking. Needless to say, I was bitterly disappointed as I had been looking forward to this break and had high expectations after my flawless experience at The Shangri-La, Bangkok in 2001. On a positive, the weather held so we had a stunning harbour view from our 12th floor room, they allowed us a slightly later check-out and my son enjoyed his Easter Chocolate workshop!

The Opera house is a short walk as well and we took in a play plus the tour. Around the nearby Circular Quay are numerous shops and restaurants. From souvenir shops to fine apparel, this location took care of the shoppers in our group. A short jaunt away from the Circular Quay area puts you in downtown Sydney with its fine dining and shopping. We walked everywhere, even over to Darling Harbor where we took in the Aquarium. If you like modern city architecture along with a flavor of the old city, this is the place to be. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed. While it was very expensive to eat at the hotel we were privileged to have breakfast included in our tour package. We did our dining in the area. You can grab a quick lunch time bite along the Circular Quay or there is a nice little burger stand just a few blocks away in the Rocks.

It needs to be made clearer what a Darling Harbour view means, as apart from a bit of an average harbour the view is mainly of a 10 lane motorway, even from the 14th floor. Limited chance of being moved, although we have asked. Other gripes, this is/was a smoking room, still has that air freshener smell.

The breakfast was okay, but for the $38 fee they charge if it's not included I would eat elsewhere - a lot of the food was getting cold, and every morning they would put out a tray of strawberries that went before you could get one, which they didn't replenish. Also the muffins and pastries always tasted kind of stale.

Less forgivable was the damp towel left in the bathroom from the previous guest. Apart from this the bathroom was huge and beautiful. We had cocktails in the bar before going out. There is a bit of a dress code thing going on, so my husband had to go & put trousers on but then we were shown to a window seat where we could see a great view of the harbour & surrounds as the sun set, absolutely awesome!

We were stunned to learn there was nowhere in the hotel where you could get a snack or even a sandwich unless you ordered room service and were willing to pay the exorbitant prices.

Originally, I booked the Emerald City package, but after discussing upgrade options with the check-in staff, we decided to upgrade to an Opera House view room on the Horizon Club floors. The reception staff were brilliant, they went through the cost of the package we had originally booked, and worked out the cost difference of staying on the club floor (only worked out to be around $20 extra a night, really worth it). We did have a couple of problems getting to our room, the first set of keys the reception staff gave us wouldn't allow us to select the floor we were staying on (30th) in the elevator. I went back to the reception area, where they replaced the keys and escorted us to the elevator to check the new keys. The new keys also didn't work, so the reception staff borrowed a key from another staff member, and used that to select our floor on the elevator panel. They were wallking away from the elevator as I asked \"so how do we fix this problem so we can get to/from our room?\". The reply was that we should go to the Horizon Club reception area on our floor and get new keys. Although this did work, it would have been much better service for the staff member to accompany us to the floor and ensure that the new keys issued by the Horizon Club worked for us. It's a minor point, but management of the hotel may want to provide some guidance to their reception staff on these sort of issues. Our room was marvelous, and lived up to all of our expectations. The view of the opera house was excellent. We were in room 3017, and had a good side view to the opera house and out over Sydney Harbour toward the headlands. We were rather close to the apartment towers next door, and I image the rooms further towards the back of the hotel (3018 onwards) would suffer with the view of the apartment complex next door - although we were very happy with the view from our room. The ammenities in the room were excellent, and we spent a good hour delighting ourselves with all the thoughtful little touches in the room. The last hotels I have experienced which are so considerate of the needs of their guests are the Shangri-La and Le Meridian hotels in Singapore, and the Sydney Shangri-La was of a similar standard. The bathroom was large and elegant, with an excellent selection of toiletries, including (to the delight of my wife) bath salts and makeup remover. We had afternoon tea and pre-dinner canopes in the Horizon Club lounge, and the quality of food and drinks was excellent. The staff were numerous and very attentive. The views from the lounge are amazing with five story high windows. We also had breakfast both mornings in the lounge, and the quality was also excellent. Particularly early in the morning (before 8am), the lounge was wonderfully quiet - things got a little hectic around 9am during breakfast, but there were plenty of staff around and they were always checking if we needed anything. I have to make a special mention of the bedding in the Horizon Club rooms. We both had two of the best nights sleep we have every had thanks to the wonderful mattress toppers (which I believe are goose or duck feather) which you just sink into. I would love to know if it's possible to purchase these mattress toppers, or which company supplies the Shangri-La with these. We would also like to mention the excellent service we received from the valet staff. We had left a charger for our camera in the car, and Michael from the valet staff was more than happy to escort us to our car so we could retrieve the charger. He also collected our bags from our room, and was professional, friendly and courteous at all times - everything that staff at a five star hotel should be.

We were made very aware that it was New year and that most of the rooms were booked out. We were given the exact same room on the floor above (716 I think). Yes we had a view of the Opera House, but it was not like the view you see on the website for the Deluxe Opera House View Room. We looked out over a highway and were surrounded by tower blocks, the view was sideways on and really disappointing. Having already complained once, I did not have the energy to present myself at reception again to go through another argument. The room was in need of an overhaul, the carpet was very tired and grubby. The bathroom while large and well appointed was also a bit tired looking. The public areas are very smart and clearly have been re-vamped in recent years.

Great view of the Opera House. 4 x free internet PC's in lobby. Great location by the rocks and harbour. Excellent spacious gym. Lots of CV equipment. The Disappointments were:- We waited so long for an order of food in the lobby bar that never arrived that we had to cancel the order and go elsewhere. It was NYE afternoon and understandably busy but we didn't expect to be paying $32 each for a burger and wait over 45 minutes in a hotel of this calibre. Went to a pub 5 minutes up the road and got our food within 10 minutes - and a lot cheaper!! Not impressed! Housekeeping tried to service our room sometime before 9.20am on the third morning, which seemed rather early. Because we were still in our room and had the privacy light on they left a card under the door telling us to phone housekeeping if we wanted our room serviced. When we tried to phone several time noone answered. We eventually had to leave a message. This seemed to be an unreasonably early time to try and service a room and surely the onus should be on the housekeeper to return later and not for us to request the room to be serviced. Poor! There was hardly ever any staff at Guest Services in the lobby. Eventually when there was I waited 10 minutes to speak to a nice lady called Minnie and feed back the 2 experiences above. She wrote everything down and told me that there wasn't a manager about (why not?) but that she would speak to one later about our issues. We never heard anything back from anyone during or after our stay. No explanation or apology from the management - nothing. Seems that it is was a total waste of time feeding this back and that the management aren't interested. Really disappointed with this. Overall the Shangri La is a smart hotel to stay in and we did really enjoy our stay in Sydney.

Mini bar, robes, slippers, comp shoe shine, newspapers WIRELESS INTERNET (woo hoo!). TV has many cable channels (but not the new digital ones). Toiletries are Shangra La branded and all lavender scented - shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothbrushes, etc. Towels are a decent size and good quality. Showerhead is GREAT ! good pressure. I found a foam pillow in the cupboard (I HATE feather pillows which every hotel in the world supplies) and we took the doona out of the bag. The bed was really soft. I think it had a sheepskin mattress protector. I don't know if it was meant to be really soft or if it was way past it's prime but I found it unusual. The air conditioning worked very well - got the temp right very quickly and easily. We had a Harbour View room and were looking directly at the the Harbour Bridge and up and down the harbour. (admittedly good views of the toll booths too - so I just looked the other way - at the Opera House). So I was WAY happy with the view - which is what we primarily wanted. And the other thing we noticed - it was so quiet. No hearing the neighbours, other TV's, trolleys in the hallway - nothing. Valet parking worked as it should. check in and out was smooth (although no express check out). We couldn't get into Altitude Restaurant for Christmas night dinner - fully booked. So we went to the Four Seasons - which was half empty and the meal wasn't great - so Sydneysiders must think that Altitude does something right.

When we need to travel to Sydney for a wedding, I immediately booked a Horizon Club room at the Shangri-La, opting for the Horizon Deluxe Grand Harbour View room. The room itself was lovely and the view from level 32 was spectacular. The problem was the little things. As regular Horizon Club guests, we have come to expect certain standards of the Horizon Club. This time, the in-room amenities (including tea and toiletries) was of a lower standard than usual, and when we asked for better quality tea, we were sent more of the same tea. The supplied toiletries were the standard hotel toiletries, rather than the more special ones usually found in Horizon Club rooms. We went to the Horizon Club lounge for afternoon tea, only to find that there was virtually no food available, and very difficult to get hot drinks (there were no tea pots and the coffee machine was malfunctioning). We asked the duty manager, who to her credit, immediately tried to rectify the problems, but the result remained the same. Then that evening, we found the bed too soft. This resulted in both my fiance and I sinking into the mattress (separately) and hardly being able to see or get close to each other. Not the ideal situation for a romantic evening. Whilst the room was lovely and the service was excellent, the little things that were inconsistent based on past experiences and therefore failed to meet expectations, really marred our stay and our impression of Shangri-La hotels.

Vancouver,Singapore and Kowloon. All are 5 star rated and deservedly so. But, the Shangri La in Sydney was a real let down. Firstly it does not have the feel of the others that I have stayed in. The hotel lobby looks like you have wandered into a Holiday Inn. To be fair, I could accept that if everything else was to 5 star expectation. Unfortunatly the hotel looks very tired and is in desperate need of refurbishment. The same has to be said of the rooms. Shabby fixtures and fittings and an old box type tv are not in my opinion up to the mark. The bars and restaurants also leave much to be desired. We came back to the hotel one evening and thought we would have a nightcap in the bar on the 36th floor and enjoy the view of the harbour. I thought that there was a problem with the elevator because we could not get it to access to the required floor. Upon enquiring, we were told that the bar was now closed. It was 10.30 pm. I asked what time did it normaly close, to be told if the lift wont take you there, thats how you know it is shut. So where is the residents bar then I asked ?.There wasent one, came the answer. Only room service. The next morning I had already decided that I would not be coming back to this hotel. But with a full working day ahead we thought it would be a good idea to have a meeting over breakfast at the restaurant on the 2nd floor. Upon entering the room I thought this is nice enough. However, as we turned the corner, to my astonishnent I could see that all the guests had been herded into one small area. It reminded me of Pontins. The breakfast was a choice of continental buffet or full breakfast buffet including make your own toast. The final 5 star service was when I asked for more milk the waitress went over to a table that a guest had just left and put the half empty jug of milk from his table onto ours. I think all the above is acceptable if your paying \u00c2\u00a375.00 a night, but not if its over \u00c2\u00a3400.00 Just very poor compared to the other hotels in this chain.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "yaya41", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "yaya41", "ReviewID": "UR49161695", "Content": "The Shangri la hotel in the Rocks is a very beautiful place to stay!

Upon return we did have a few pieces of fresh fruit and a letter in our room which outlined the inclusions when booking a Horizon Club room.

My work colleague and I stayed in a corner room and it was a nice surprise to stay in such a beautiful room!! The bed was the comfiest I had ever slept in, and the pillows were to die for!!! Loved the window seats where we spent some of our time just relaxing, taking in the view. Staff were all friendly, especially in Cafe Mix, where we had a lovely waitress Bonnie attend our table. She was lovely and very caring and attentive!!! The staff in the Altitude bar on the top floor were very friendly, I did think that $7.50 for a glass of lemonade was a bit excessive though. But the view was breathtaking. Our room was attended to twice daily, each time we arrived back during our day, the room was clean, bed was made, bins were emptied, towels changed, shoes put in the wardrobe and they even put the ironing board away each day for us, which I didn't expect! The housekeeping staff would step aside in the corridors as you passed and said hello, even the chef at Cafe Mix asked how my day was going! At the end of the stay when we checked out, my work colleague thought she lost her phone and went to ask if anyone had handed it in. One of the staff members escorted her back to the room we stayed in to see if it was left in there and even offered to ring her number to see if they could hear it ringing. Downside was the massive hill we had to climb up to get to the hotel. I definitely got my exercise in, climbing up and down that hill!! We also woke on Sunday morning at 7am to council workers trimming the hedge on a nearby retaining wall with their loud hedge trimmers. But it wasn't too much of a problem for us as we had to be up early anyway.

I got home to SF after a nice holiday and immediately reviewed charges to my credit card. I noticed two unusual charges from Shangri-La hotel. One for $47 and one for $49.

We prepaid for the hotel and got a great deal and chose a room in the Horizon Club. It was $40 extra for the Horizon Club when we booked it, which we thought was totally worth it. My understanding is that the Horizon Club rooms have been upgraded while some of the regular rooms have not. Our room was very nice - huge bathroom with shower and separate jacuzzi tub, flat screen TV, very comfortable bed. If you are in the Horizon Club, you can choose to have a full breakfast on the top floor or a continental breakfast in the Horizon Club (30th floor). We chose the full breakfast every day and thought it was excellent. The Horizon Club also has evening drinks (wine/beer/cocktails) and appetizers from 6-8 each night. We enjoyed this every night - it was great to have a glass of wine and enjoy the views of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. There are also 2 computers in the Horizon Club to use the Internet. These could get busy but it was a nice extra. Our room was a Darling Harbour View room on the 33rd floor. Initially we hoped to upgrade to an Opera House view room but based on the layout of the hotel, I think unless you book a suite, you won't be able to get a great view of the opera house - you will only see it when you look out of the window at an angle. The Suites, which are all on the front of the building would have excellent Opera House views but those are obviously much more money. Plus, you can go enjoy the view in the Horizon Club any time you want. The other advantage to the Darling Harbour View rooms is that they face west, so we could watch the beautiful sunset from our room. The hotel is a great location - a quick walk to Circular Quay, Opera House, The Rocks. One thing that I saw mentioned in several reviews was the \"big\" hill that you have to walk up coming back from Circular Quay. I thought the hill was very minor and not something to worry about at all (although I do live in San Francisco, which is quite hilly).

At the start of our holiday we had stayed in a suite at the Marriott Sydney Harbour (I do not recommend, see other review) which was yuk, so we had high expectations even more so as we have previously stayed at the Shangri-La in Muscat and I am pleased to say we were not disappointed. On arrival we were escorted to the Executive check-in on the 30th floor. We were upgraded to an Executive suite on the Executive floor (please Shangri-La I cannot understand the difference between an Executive and non-Executive suite) on the 34th floor. Anyway, the room did not disappoint in either its presentation or its location. It gave us views of just over 270 degrees from Darling Harbour (the Blue Mountains were just visible in the distance), the Harbour Bridge, Opera House, Taronga Zoo through to the Naval docks, with the Rocks in the immediate foreground. You can even see the Harbour Bridge climbers from the window. The suite consisted of a sitting room with large flat screen TV and a DVD player and views of the Bridge to the naval docks. Off the entrance hall was a guest toilet. The bedroom was large (but a CRT TV) and marble bathroom was large with separate toilet, walk in shower, the bath was placed next to the large windows so you could enjoy panoramic views from Darling Harbour to just before the Harbour Bridge whilst laying in the bath. This was especially memorable at night. There was also a separate dressing table with hair dryer. Bathroom products were from L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane. The towels were large, white and very fluffy. Our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rollaway was set up in front of the window in the sitting room overlooking the Bridge and Opera House, but to be honest the view is a bit wasted on a 9 year old boy. The windows all have wide ledges which you can sit in to really appreciate the views especially at sunrise and sunset. The great thing was that WiFi is free in the room which was the case only here, of the four hotels we stayed in whilst in Australia. The desk in the room came with bull dog clips, cellotape, stapler, paper, envelopes. The room also comes with fresh fruit and a couple of bottles of water (complimentary) each day. The service in the Executive lounge was exemplary as is the view. There was usually a host on hand and of particular note was the lovely gentleman who spoilt my son by not only making him a hot chocolate with marshmallows, but even took it to him whilst he was surfing the net. There are complimentary tea, coffee, soft drinks and some snacks during the day. There are hot hor d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeurves in the evening and alcohol. Unfortunately the swimming pool and main restaurant were out of commission. Breakfast was either on the 36th floor (a temporary location) for a full buffet breakfast or in the continental on the 30th. We opted for the full breakfast. The choice was large, bacon came either very crispy or non-crispy, two types of sausages were available, veal or pork and there was an egg station for omelettes. Also waffles, pancakes etc. (Dear Shangri-La you could do with renewing the juice containers, they are a little old and tired). On our first evening we had room service as we were tired from flying down from Brisbane. Our meal arrived in 20 minutes and was piping hot. On the second evening we tried the temporary Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Mix which was relocated because of the refurbishments. As other reviewers have commented, this was disappointing. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat sea food, and these were over represented and not much salad material. It is also fair comment that it is relatively overpriced given the limited choice available. My experience is that generally, Shangri-La\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buffet restaurants are an excellent choice. Certainly the one we went to in Oman was wonderful and in Hong Kong we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a reservation during a one week stay (at another hotel) in the city. We therefore elected to have room service again. This was a poor experience compared to the previous evening. The food was lukewarm and took 70 minutes to arrive. Given that we were tired from sightseeing all day and our son hungry we ate it. Following discussions with a manager we were not charged, but the hotel needs to review their food service. To have two experiences which varied so widely is not good, especially when you know they can do so much better. This was the only negative comment. On another note, our son loved the koala bear he received from reception when he went to post a card. Lovely touch! Also the child size slippers were great from the Executive Lounge host. An even nicer touch would be if they were delivered together with the rollaway bed, trust me you would endear yourselves to families. As a parent, often the hotel you choose is based on their attitude and treatment of your children. Would I recommend this hotel, absolutely!

Ok so check around certain websites to see if you can get cheaper rates etc but I called 2 months before hand to their sales and the lady gave me an ok deal. It was a decent price and included the premier grand hotel room with front rows seats of the harbour bridge and the opera house. Now when we arrived because I organised a trip on the harbour bridge, we arrived with our car and told the guy to take our luggage to our room later when we check in. Went to harbour bridge for our walk and by the time we came back it was around 2:30 so got our keys and the best thing with Horizon club is you get access to floor 30 which has the room where you can get free afternoon snacks.. us being buggered we had our free snacks and then it was time to check out our room. Got into our room (2813) and small walkway, the bathroom wish that was bigger and then the view is great! the room is really big as well too as you can see from the pictures. Our luggage wasn't there so we told the guy to collect it, seemed a bit arrogant saying if i requested it which i did or else i wouldn't have complained that my luggage isn't in the room. One small dissapointment to the room is the wall that blocks the overall view but this is ok because you can see it from the other window, plus the tv is a big one, would have thought a think LCD one would have been more professional for the hotel. Eventually they came and we just relaxed in the room. we also moved the bed so we would have a mad view when we woke up. Apart from that, horizon also has evening drinks between 6-8pm free for horizon patrons. we had alot and that could of been enough for dinner hehe but we went to the rocks for a snack (wedges! lol) and then we were hammered. Come breakfast you can either have it on horizon club or downstairs, go downstairs! more variety and all you can eat. we also tried to get late check-out but were told we had to out by 11! grrrr but oh wells. overall a good experience for the price I paid for, probably wouldn't do it again as this was special because it was one of our anniversaries. If you were a tourist, theres probably better places to be but if you had to splurge on one night in sydney and willing to pay $500 then get the horizon premier grand room, then this is the place to do it. The only small problem i suppose is access to the hotel during the night, even though its right in sydney the walk from the back entrance to the rocks doesn't look appealing in the dark when the place looks empty, your find when you get to the road that leads up to the rocks but yeah from the back to the road, it doesn't look enticing. not much people around so you would get a sense that someone could rob you there so i think thats a problem with the shangri-la location.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat view...big hill.\u201d", "Author": "DfromOC", "ReviewID": "UR34975904", "Content": "Check in was smooth.

But my rating of this hotel is ultimately justified by their swift solutions when given the opportunity to put something right. I have stayed here twice each year for the last three years in various room categories. Four times out of six, the rooms have been wonderful from the onset. Twice I received a room that I was unhappy with- in one room one of the wheels had come of the bed, and in another (on another occasion) there was clearly a smell of smoke in the non-smoking room. Problems like this you either get angry about and cause a scene, or you give the hotel the chance to put it right. Each time something has been pointed out like this, the hotel staff have excelled themselves in resolving the issue. The last time I was greeted at the door of the room I was unhappy with by the duty manager, and she was impeccably polite, she noted everything I said and she asked for just a few minutes to sort something out for me. She returned with the Housekeeping manager, and they took me to another room, on another floor, showed me round and made sure it was comfortable, which it was. In general then, the hotel location is excellent, up a hill from George street, but there are numerous ways to approach it, some routes easier than others, try some of the side streets for a gradual incline rather than walking straight up from George St, explore a little and you'll find an easy route. Try leaving the hotel from the lower ground floor, you get direct street access and a quicker walk in to town/harbour. The beds are wonderful. The bathrooms are beautiful in marble. The views are AMAZING, no question. I have stayed in Opera House view, Grand Harbour view and most recently I took a Premier Grand Harbour view... the latter was so perfect I couldn't stop smiling to myself. Windows galore, and window seats, you can lose hours sitting there watching the harbour, there cannot be a better view! Finally, the staff are always ultra-professional. The reception/check in are always helpful and I have never found them anything other than friendly. The last time I checked out the the lady behind the desk was telling me all about the New Years Eve experience in Sydney, and other places she had been etc. So give it a go; and if you find your stay anything less than acceptable, let them have the chance to put it right for you, because that is the measure of a five star hotel!

The rooms are very spacious, very modern, clean, and quite nice overall. The room had free coffee and tea service. The staff were very polite and attentive. One thing I really appreciated is that we showed up at the hotel in the morning of the day that we were to check in, and the hotel allowed us to check in and go to our room. We had just arrived after a very long flight from the US, so we were very appreciative. I found the Internet service to be very disappointing. Free wireless Internet is provided in the lobby and on floors 30 and above. However, the ShangriLa has for some reason decided not to supply wireless Internet to the floors up to floor 29. A wired Internet connection is available in the room. However, connecting through it is difficult. It took a while to get the Internet connection to work, and I had to reboot my computer a couple of times. It worked for a while, but when I left and came back, I found that the Internet connection would time out and kick me off after about a minute. Even rebooting did not work. I called the Internet support desk, which I will admit was readily available, but after 20 minutes I was no closer to having my Internet connection restored. I ended up going to the lobby and working on the Internet there. It was very disappointing for a 5-star hotel. I hope that the ShangriLa extends their wireless Internet, which seemed much more accessible and reliable, to all of their guest rooms. Additionally, I booked a room with a view of the Sydney Opera House. While the room did have a view of the Opera House, the Opera House was pretty far to the left side of the window. We had to stand at the right edge of the window to see the Opera House to the left. This might have been because we were allowed to check in quite early. If that was the case, then that was understandable. I likely would have asked for a different room with a better view of the Opera House, except that I was so grateful just to have a room early in the day. Overall, our stay was very nice.

The views from the 36th-floor bar Altitude are even better, the ambience is upscale-wine-bar perfect, and the cocktails aren't much more than what you would pay elsewhere - highly recommended. The bed was luxurious and the furniture/fittings were quite good, but nothing to write home about. A light and proper coat-hangers in the hallway closet were small, pleasant surprises. The bathroom was vast and well-appointed, and I wished I could take the great shower stall with me. The staff were friendly and polite and professional, though they did leave the breakfast cart in our room for ages. The buffet breakfast was excellent, with an abundance of choice. Then again, some of the choices didn't look very appealing, even to our world-travelled palates. Problems - the TV was an old-fashioned CRT. Largish for its type, but far smaller than the LCD I have at home, and certainly sub-par for a 5-star hotel. It brought down the tone a bit, compared to the rest of the room. It also had bad reception on some channels. In addition, the selection of entertainment on demand was quite small. The room-service breakfast was very nice, but we had to eat off the breakfast cart because there was no real table, just a desk against the wall. That would have been fine, except it was basically a solid box, so we had to splay our legs or sit sidesaddle in order to eat.

I had researched extensively the 5-star hotels on Circular Quay, and this was where we wanted to be! Let me start with the positives. The hotel itself: Stunning. Room: Nicest I have ever stayed. Concierge: Amazing. Location: Perfect. Helpfulness of the staff: Impeccable. Matt at the front desk: Should be given a raise. He bent over backwards to try to help us with the circus I am about to describe, bud sadly, and despite his best efforts, these problems just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get fixed as one would expect (namely, after complaining about it ONCE). We checked in to room 2914\u00e2\u20ac\u201dOpera House view. Gorgeous room, except that given the design of the hotel, a view to see the whole Opera House is partially obstructed by the design of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnothing horrible, but as I had researched the Shangri La extensively (and no mention of this is made on the hotel website) and I had flown in from the U.S., I was hoping for the complete view. We went downstairs and were immediately helped; we were told the hotel was fully booked that night (Queen's birthday weekend), but our things would be moved the next day to a room with an unobstructed view. Excellent. When we returned the next evening from our touring, we were given keys to a new room (2916\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtwo double beds) and our bags had already been moved. Sadly, this is where the story just begins. When we moved to the new room, we noticed some cleanliness issues: There was a dirty towel on the closet floor; there was a large, disgusting, highly questionable stain on one bed spread ; and there was only one robe and one set of slippers (should have been two); and by the hot/cold water handles in the sink, there was clipped beard hair. YUK! It was late, we were tired and went to bed. First thing next morning we marched to the front desk to ask for help. Matt was on the job and assured us it would be taken care of. However, in doing so, we ALSO discovered that there were some registration problems\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey had us (incorrectly) in the computer as checking out that day and were going to charge us for drinks from the mini bar (which we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touched)! It seemed like the prior guest had not been checked out properly on the computer. No worries, that problem was fixed immediately in the computer. Upon our return later that night, the dirty towel had been taken and Matt had left a handwritten note of apology! We appreciated that, but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6nothing else in the room was addressed! So we contacted Matt at front desk again\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe again described the exact location of the beard hair, and Matt again took charge of taking care of it. Clearly, there were some major communication problems between front desk and housekeeping. So we headed out for dinner or some such and upon return expected to put this whole episode behind us. BUT NO! The same stained bed spread was there, and about half of the beard hair was cleaned\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut the other half was still there! OMG! At this point, it was all just too much So feeling the need to be more proactive, we folded the bedspread and took it downstairs to show the problem and get the thing out of our room. Matt at the front desk was mortified and could not have apologized more profusely. He gave me a complaint card to fill out, which I did, including my email. He took a bit of the room costs off and gave us coupons for drinks/dinner. We appreciated his doing this, we really felt like he was doing his best to help. We then spent some time out of the room getting drinks (at the bar at the top of the hotel, and the view is spectacular and it was lovely), then back to the room--and the gentleman who appeared to be the housekeeping supervisor was in the room. He finished inspecting the room and informed us the new bed spread would arrive soon. The second robe had been delivered. A new, clean spread arrived and we were ready for bed. I went to put on my robe and slippers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dOOPS, still no 2nd pair of slippers. And when I went to brush my teeth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe remaining half of the beard hair was still on the sink! This was beyond belief. We were pooped, but did call the front desk AGAIN to note this ongoing problem before we went to bed. The next morning, I left early for Cairns while my travel companion stayed on one final day in our room at the Shangri La. After a day or touring Sydney on the 10th, she returned to the room to find a message from the hotel manager. But when she called him back, the person manning the front desk (it was someone other than Matt) who fielded the call refused to put her through directly to the manager (despite her explaining the problem and noting she was returning the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call)! So she was never able to hear back from the hotel manager. And despite my leaving my name and email on the complaint card, and the room being in my name and paid by me, I never heard back from the manager, either. To top it off, my travel companion later returned to the room (her final night at the hotel) to find the house keeper on hands and knees cleaning the bathroom floor. Beard hair on sink still there. So she showed the house keeper the hair, which was finally removed. Oh--and the second set of slippers finally showed up. This is a lovely hotel with great staff. We felt like housekeeping did the best they could, as well as the front desk. But clearly there were *major* communication issues between the front desk staff and house keeping staff to take care of these minor matters. It was only when I returned home to the U.S. and found out from my travel companion what had happened when she tried to call back the manager, and that the manager had not tried to communicate with me via the email address I left on the complaint card, that I decided to write this review on TripAdvisor.

The following morning (Saturday), we contacted the concierge to book a table at Altitudes. When we returned from our sightseeing at around 5pm, we were told that we had been confirmed for a 4 course dinner. I made a call to the concierge only to find that there is always a mandatory 4 course dinner for Fridays and Saturdays...would have been nice for the hostess to show us the correct menu! Because we only had 1 hour and 15 minutes to dine (we had a show to catch at the Opera House), they told us to just go to the bar where we could grab a table and order off the bar menu. The bar menu was extremely basic, but we were able to convince them to allow us to order off of the regular a-la-carte menu. Service was fair, and the food was a 7/10. Cafe Mix: The first morning, we decided to dine at Cafe Mix. They had a pretty wide variety of choices served buffet style. Unfortunately, almost everything (except the muffins) were fairly close to inedible. The omlet station had no one working at it (I had to politely yell to the back of the kitchen for someone to come after a line of 5 people had formed), there was no one around to clear plates (I just put the dirty plates on another empty table), and I had to ask twice to get coffee.

I've previously lived in Sydney so I knew the location. I selected the Premier Grand Harbour View room for the view and the welcome luxury after a series of long-haul flights. The problems started with check-in - the receptionist didn't understand that \"Advance Purchase\" meant \"purchased in advance\" - basic English, I would have thought. I insisted that the room was already paid for and my card was to be used just for incidentals, and showed her the hotel confirmation email. She insisted that it wasn't already paid for and my card would be billed the entire amount. After a 27-hour journey, this wasn't the way I wanted to start my stay in Oz. Eventually a supervisor appeared from a backroom on another errand, and sorted the problem out (card details for payment are on another screen...), but this bad start put me completely off using any of the hotel facilities - including the upgrade that started the whole discussion. The receptionist then got shirty with us and brushed off her mistake saying \"Oh! It's so complicated!\" Um, no, it's not, Advance Purchase means just what it says on the tin. For a 5-star hotel, there are remarkably few concessions - the bottled water on the night-stand was $3.50, which annoyed me - I've frequently had complimentary bottled water at 3-star hotels, and it's precisely the sort of customer-care that I expect at a 5-star establishment. And that seemed to be the theme for the entire stay - not so much \"what can we do for you?\" but more \"what can we charge you extorbitant fees for?\". The room had the expected fantastic view, at least from one side. The other side looked out onto neighbouring apartment blocks and hotels, so the curtains on that side remained closed for the entire stay. Due to this I rather regretted not getting one of the rooms to the side, and saving a few hundred dollars a night. So if you are thinking of getting a corner room, do ensure it's one with views of the harbour from BOTH sides. The room was was very nice and spacious with a big comfy bed and excellent bath-room. The hotel is modern enough, but due to the above billing problem I didn't bother trying out any of the bars or amenities, including the spa. Location-wise it's at the top of a steep hill, not far from Wynyard, except that the usual route from Wynyard is closed due to building works. All in all, the next time I think I will be checking out the Four Seasons or something like that, same view, same cost, but hopefully better trained staff.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattlelite in Europe", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay even with kids!\u201d", "Author": "SeattleliteinEurope", "ReviewID": "UR30698049", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights with our 3 kids.

Upon checking in we found the rooms to be quite acceptable, if not a little oddly shaped, with an excellent view (We were only on the 12th floor). We enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea (You must try the apple and amaretto tea) in the piano lounge and enjoyed a nice dinner down at darling harbour. Our main problems occurred in the morning, we went to breakfast at about 9.45am and enjoyed a great meal of eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns and omlettes(any place that has their own egg chef is fine by me) . My partner enjoyed the chinese breakfast of vegetarian noodles. Unfortunately half way through our breakfast the staff started packing up all of the buffet items and scurried around with trolleys picking up the juices, serving utensils etc. we were by no means the only people still in the restaurant and surely this could have waited until the place had cleared out. Our next problem occurred just as we were about to leave our room, at approximately 10.40am there was a knock on our door only to be confronted by a member of staff asking us whether we were planning to check out, or did we have a late check out. Considering that check out was not for another 20mins at 11am this gave us a sense of being rushed out of our room. Our third and most important issue occurred on checking out. We found the girl on the front desk to be surly and gruff . We had booked a package deal that included free parking, which the girl had attempted to charge us for, upon questioning her about this and informing her our parking was supposed to be free she replied \"fine, well don't worry about it then\". This is a really unacceptable attitude for front of house staff to have as they are the face of your company This overcharging appeared to be not only our problem as the people next to us were also experiencing problems with their bill and items that they had already paid for.

We stayed at the Shangrila Sydney for the purpose of a small xmas celebration for our party of 3 girlfriends. A Grand Deluxe Harbour Club suite was booked. We checked in separately as each was flying/driving in from various places. Checkin for all was above expectation and kind of fun in the fact that we were separately whisked up to the Club lounge and whisked down to our lower level to our suite. I could hardly contain myself at the size of the suite, the incredible views (and I am from Sydney) and the plushness although it is slightly dated. I was hoping around and dying for my friends to arrive.... and they did. We hugged and congratulated on how special we were to be here and then a knock at the door with the Moet'. In our excitement we had forgotten this was with the package. POP. The Hotel had forgotten the extra bed.... but quickly that was whisked in. If we had thought about this we would have had them put this in the massive king bedroom rather than the living room.... but did we care at the time. Did I mention the bathroom. It was huge with floor to ceiling (almost) window and although it was overlooking the toll booths...... once we rang and ascertained no-one could view us we enjoyed the spectacle. We took advantage of the pre-dinner drinks up on the Club Lounge and I would advise to get there right on starting time because we didnt and it was a little too crowded and pushy for food for our liking for a hotel of this class. Anyway we had a quick drink and a snack and ventured out for dinner. We arrived back several hours later and as advised decided to order breakfast to our room for 9.30am. When it got to 10.00am we called and were advised that we should take it in the cafe as no record was made of our booking for room service. This did not suit us and we pushed for it to be delivered to our room. Several phone calls and 1 hr later resulted in a very small poor selection of either cold or frozen food arriving to our room. Not happy. When checking out the Hotel tried to charge us for the breakfast to the room but ON A GOOD NOTE after writing to the Hotel they refunded the cost of the breakfast in a form of a voucher to be used at the Hotel.

Not a perfect view, since the side of the building blocked the Opera House from some parts of the room, but pretty darn good for under A$200/night. It was great watching the sunrise from there the first morning. Everything was great. I would leave for an hour to get breakfast in the Rocks area each morning, and when I came back the room was always made up already. No waiting until 4pm like at some places. The internet was free, and worked perfectly. Bathroom was large, well laid out and spotless. My last morning I requested a late checkout and it was granted immediately. I then went to the spa to see about getting a massage, and they fit me in only an hour later. One of the best massages I've gotten anywhere.

We could watch the ferries coming in and out of the port, the view was out of this world and you would look out for what seems like seconds and hours had passed becuase it was that good. The hotel staff are lovely!!! especially the doorman who you can ask any question about sydney and they could give you a full answer, often including the ferry times of ticket price. The food was amazing we only had breakfast but that was all you needed with the range of cooked foods, fresh fruit and juicies, we drank litres of apple juice every morning. The rooms were very clean with internet points, two phones and massive bathroom with huge seperate shower. One important fact the hotel is on a very steep hill so go out the entrance to the right of the reception point and that comes out half way down the hill once you have go down a few steps. Butif you are not a step person go right out of the main entrance and that will take you to the rocks area. This hotel is in the perfect location for everything just ten mins from circular key, within 25 mins you can be sitting on the steps outside the opera house, and the bridge climb centre is on the same road, and if you are going to sydney - DO THE BRIDGE CLIMB - it is worth every penny as is the hotel!!! can't wait to go back!!!!!", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guildford", "Title": "\u201cSuperb location with outstanding views\u201d", "Author": "VirginiaGuildford", "ReviewID": "UR27060480", "Content": "We stayed for a couple of nights at the end of a great holiday to Australia.

Some may think that the Hyatt is a better view because you are closer, but personally, I would rather be looking down at the whole view, not just across the harbor from it. There are varying levels of \"opera house\" view rooms at the Shangri La, but if you get the \"Premier Grand Harbor View\" room, this is the best possible view. Apparently, according to other reviews here, some \"opera house\" views are skewed off to the side. With the room we had, however, (see pictures) you could wake up on the morning and look out from your bed at the sunrise over the opera house. Truly phenomenal.

Firstly I must say that we have stayed in Sydney a number of times in different Hotels and Motels and have been generally disappointed with quality and cleanliness. Our impression of the Shangri La was second to none. The porters and assistants at the front door started the experience with friendly information and luggage assistance. Book in was a little delayed but the hotel is so close to The Rocks that we went for a quick walk and enjoyed what the place had to offer. When we got to our room we were blown away by the view of the harbour. We asked for a Darling Harbour view and got upgraded to a grand harbour view without asking for it. My wife was delivered champagne and a lovely birthday cake on arrival which made this whole experience really special. Onto the rooms: Our room was extremely clean and well appointed with marble bathroom. Beds comfortable. TV wasn't even watched due to the magnificent view. We paid for the emerald package which I would suggest to anyone. It costs an extra $50 Aus per day but well worth it. This allows you valet parking/free breakfast and entry to gym and spa. On estimation the valet parking and breakfast for 2 would cost an extra $110 per day on it's own. Breakfast is a well appointed full continental selection with lots of tastes catered for. A egg chef will make you what you like on demand. The only downside to the Hotel was that the Altitude restuarant was closed both days we were there (Sunday and Australia Day Monday), but we knew this at least 1 month prior so we made other dinner arrangements. Drinks at Blue Horizon are expensive but this is not unlike any other exclusive cocktail bar. The view is magnificent from the 36th Floor and a great place to enjoy a romantic drink.

The room was small and rather shabby. As others have mentioned, the furniture was chipped and worn, the carpet stained and the water pressure in the shower was rather pathetic as mentioned in an earlier guest's review. The tv and amenities certainly didn't come anywhere near 5 star in my estimation.

They made no attempt to help us with a reservation for any other night unless we wanted to dine after 9:30 PM. The buffet breakfast was awful (and terribly expensive given the lack of quality)....everything was cold and stale and to add to that, the waitress spilled coffee all over me and never even apologized!!!

When I review a hotel I always zero in on the attitude of the reception staff as this makes or breaks a hotel in my view - and the young man was smiling, made eye contact and was ultra efficient. The view from the room was stunning as were the comfortable beds - probably amongst the best in Sydney. On departing 2 days later my car was waiting for me downstairs and I was checked out again within minutes - who could ask for more? Well, I had some issues which are minor really but which might make me think of staying at the Intercontinental (for example) rather than the Shangri-La. The first was the menu for in-room dining - the selection was woeful compared to the full restaurant menu available at the Intercontinental - and we went out for a meal rather than eat in. The second issue was the weak water stream from the shower (in the otherwise perfect bathroom).

What helpful and friendly people. All requests are received with a courteous and helpful response. And, it is worth remembering, our period of stay was during the most hectic time of year. Not a single hiccup. We most particularly appreciated the fact that we were able to check in immediately on our arrival from a long haul flight from the UK which landed at 0645. I knew beforehand that the Shangri-La prides itself on its ability to accommodate very many long haul early arrivals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this was Boxing Day!! Full marks all round. As a wheelchair user I am going to concentrate on disabled friendly aspects of the hotel in this review. The shower is walk in with a full glass surround with door, with a step of around 9-10cm into the cubicle. The floor is non-slip tiling. There are no grab handles in the shower itself but if you only need to hold something lightly for balance rather than for full support then the taps are useful and there is a small knob on the door. The hotel is happy to supply a plastic stool to use in the shower. The shower head can be adjusted to pull forward, which changes the height of the water flow. The bathroom floor itself is non-slip flooring. The bath has grab handles on the side but would probably not be suitable for most disabled guests. The inside has rounded oval sides, Although there is a level top which is wide at the tap end, there is no shower head on the bath for use with a bath board. Because this is a standard room the sink area is not designed for use with a wheelchair. It is however possible to get fairly close to the sink area. The make-up mirror is fixed too high for seated use. This is a huge room, 70 sq m inclusive of the wardrobe/luggage area by the door. An entrance corridor leads into the bedroom/lounge area, with the bathroom fully separate. There is masses of room for manoeuvring a wheelchair around the room, which has more the feel of a suite. Three large picture windows give a stupendous panoramic view of the harbour, including the bridge, the Opera House, the Rocks and East towards the Heads. It is one of the renowned \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnumber 13\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms (2013 on floor 20). I can think of no better introduction to our stay in Sydney than to walk into this room. I hired a mobility scooter for use in Sydney. This could have been brought into the room for overnight charging, but hotel staff agreed for it to remain outside in the corridor where there was a convenient plug socket. The room was accessed from a corner of the main corridor so it was not obstructing the passage way. Travellers may already know that the hotel is situated in an area where there is a bit of a steep walk up from The Rocks and Circular Quay area. However wheelchair users and less mobile people do not need to have concerns about this as the hotel staff will explain an extremely user friendly way of travelling up and down between buildings and accessing the hotel elevator from the LG Gloucester Street entrance. Ingenious. There is of course a ramped level access to the principal hotel entrance. I would have no hesitations in thoroughly recommending this hotel to any traveller, whether for vacation or business (the hotel being situated at the Northern end of the CBD and possessing the usual full range of business facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of which we only used the broadband connection). Probably, the charge for broadband is the only minor downside of this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I would say the same about all properties that make such a charge. Having now stayed at several good hotels in Sydney, the Shangri-La is the one to which we would return.

Having been to superb 5* hotels along the way, we were extremely disappointed in the Shangri-la Hotel, Sydney. We booked a triple room for 9 nights, as our daughter was flying from the UK 4 days before Christmas to be with us over the festive season. We arrived at the Shangri-la 2 days before our daughter was due to join us, only to find the room had everything for 2 people! (We paid for a triple room for whole duration). I feel we were given a bog standard double room, in which they would put in a fold up bed. (The view over Darling Harbour was excellent though). To cut a very long story short, the day our daughter arrived, we explained to reception that our room was made up to accommodate 2 people. To be fair, no sooner was that said, than housekeeping brought a fold-up bed!! We told him to foget it, as there wouldn't be any room for us to move around if that had been put up. We then had to request more towels, more shampoo, slippers, dressing gown etc. - Oh yes, and a cup and saucer would have been good - if it had been clean when they handed it to us!!! I ran after the housekeeper in the corrider and pointed out the sticky jam etc on the underside of the saucer - yeuch! On to the dining room - a LOT of training of the waiters/waitresses (and the chef who makes the omlettes) is required here. I requested an Eggs Benedict on my first morning and that was no problem, he would bring it over to my table, which he duly did. The day before Xmas Eve was very busy in the hotel and this showed in the attitude of the waitresses and the chef. When I requested an Eggs Benedict again, I was told in no uncertain terms they did not have time! We were told on 2 separate occasions by the waitresses \"the buffet will be closing in 15 minutes\". Any 5* hotels we have stayed in in the past, have NEVER acted in this way. When I requested 2 tea bags for my pot of tea at breakfast, you thought I was asking for the moon! Eventually I was brought a tea pot - with no lid - he was looking for one!!! When he eventually did bring one with a lid, the lid had no handle. Result - one pot of COLD tea. As for the chef, his hygiene skills need looking at. I overheard a lady in the dining room say that the day before, the chef dropped his spatula he was using to make the omlettes on the floor and immediately picked it up and used it again without washing it!!! One day they had run out of bread, the next it was butter. There just seemed to be these little niggling anomalies happening, that shouldn't.

The first day i called them they could not find my reservation. The second day i called them they still could not find it but after i 'poked' them a little bit they found it. They then could not find the form which said to charge 'all charges' to the credit card provided. After about 20 minutes it was found and about 48 hours later i was happy my reservations was ok. All reservation staff i spoke to could not speak proper english which made it hard for me to communicate to them. Check in was a nightmare. There was a nice 'meet and greet' lady to welcome us into the hotel. She then followed us around the foyer which made me feel like i was being watched as we were about to steal something. The check in process took so long as they could not find our booking. Lucky for us i printed out our confirmation and the booking was found (somehow they put out first name last and vice versa). Unfortunately we were being booked in by a trainee which took an eternity. This is ok as its good to receive a nervous smile from people on the front desk. The room we checked into was large but very tired looking. The bathroom was also large but just as tired looking. We could hear a neighbours talking and the slam from their doors echoed all night.

I tried to call their phone sevice people to ask a few questions and was left standing there on hold for over 10 minutes.........i hung up. I tried again and thank goodness i was only holding the phone for 5 minutes.

The food was great and i lost count how many lobsters i ate. The service was ok. Only one person was kind eniough to ask us if we wanted a drink the entire night. The buffet dinner was very expensive but at least i ate my way through the lobsters to make up for the cost :-) Breakfast was also very nice and plentyful. Check out the next day was also slow. The line was leading out the door to the check out desk and the person who served us looked like a robot with no smile. The valet threw me my keys and i was happy to be out of the place. Overall the Shangri-La has disappointed me yet again (the last disappointment came from the Fiji Shangri-La but thats another story). Their lack of service and claim to be 5 star is crazy. Their rooms are definately not 5 star. I never even received a reply to my complaint made via thier website even though it stated all emails are replied to.

My partner had corresponded with the hotel on several occasions beforehand to ensure everything went smoothly e.g. to ask for early check-in as we were arriving at 8.00am and the response was always fast, efficient and very polite. As soon as the taxi pulled up outside the hotel, our cases were whisked off and we were welcomed to the hotel by a very lovely lady (Mo) who escorted us to the check-in desk (the lobby/reception was buzzing with people as it was 8.30ish). We were served by Julie who was a real joy and very helpful. Unfortunately, our room wasn't ready (the hotel did say that they couldn't guarantee early check-in) but Julie said that they would ensure that the room was on the priority list to clean as soon as it become available. Although we were tired after our 24 hour flight, we were high on adrenalin and just wanted to get out and explore, so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bother us. However, we were shown to shower rooms on the second floor (complete with toiletries) in order that we could freshen up which was great. We eventually checked in at 2.00pm (could have checked in sooner but were to busy exploring!) and although the room did have a side view of the Opera House, we were rather disappointed that the adjacent hotel was literally 40ft opposite us and was rather overbearing. My partner decided to go back to reception to see if we could improve the room. The manager was very polite and although the hotel was fully booked, she managed to upgrade us to a fantastic corner room on the 10th floor with stunning views of the harbour/bridge and of course\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the Opera House. We did have to pay a slight upgrade fee, but considering what the standard cost for the room should have been, we got a great deal. 10 minutes after arriving in our room, a porter brought a bottle of champagne to our room with compliments from the hotel for any inconvenience caused which we thought was a really nice touch. Our room was really nicely furnished with kind size bed, sofa, armchair, minibar (rather expensive), coffee table and desk in the main living area (plus wide window seals that you could sit/lay on). The bathroom was lovely and included bath, separate shower and double sinks. The odd piece of furniture did show signs of ageing, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t obvious and certainly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheapen the room. Our room was serviced daily and my actual birthday, the maid organised for a birthday cake to be left in our room (presumably as she'd seen my cards!) and I also had another complimentary bottle of champagne from the hotel later that day. My partner had booked a meal at Altitude restaurant on the 36th Floor of the Shangri-la on my actual birthday and it was truly amazing in terms of food and night time views of the harbour. Our waiter was so attentative and although the meal was expensive, it was so worth it just for the whole experience. Check-out was really smooth and our bill was spot on i.e. no overcharges. We returned to the hotel a week later for one night before our flight back to the UK and were given a 25 dollar voucher to use at The Blu Horizon Bar (next to Altitude on 36th floor) when we checked in (a nice touch!). Location of the hotel is perfect to explore Circular Quay although very steep hill/lots of steps to get to it, so probably not suitable for the infirm. Overall, we just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault the hotel and what the staff did for us, it made it the best 40th birthday anyone could wish for.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat Views, Not so great service\u201d", "Author": "A_Guy_80", "ReviewID": "UR22699128", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights at grand harbour view room recently.

That was several years ago when it was called the ANA Hotel. Back then, it was the best five-star hotel in Sydney. Everything about the hotel was first rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the service, the rooms, the views. Well, after returning there recently under the current ownership, all it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got going for it now are the views. Boy, has the Shangri La chain - or at least, the current management of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spoiled an outstanding property. The air conditioning in our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work properly and our first night was quite uncomfortable. I had asked to be relocated shortly after checking-in but was told there were no alternative rooms available. At 7:00am the next day, we were told the AC would be fixed by 8:00am. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We had to insist on being relocated and after a display of heavy sighs from front desk staff, we were moved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to a smoking room that reeked. Back down to the front desk where the staff again made us feel like we were putting them out. Finally, a non-smoking room with working air conditioning was found and we were relocated to our third room in 14 hours. We joined five other couples for a business gathering at the hotel. Four of the five couples had their reservations messed up. This was a recurring theme across the two days we stayed at the Shangri La in Sydney. We heard numerous people complaining, in the elevators and in the queues at the front desk, about not getting the room type they had booked. There was a surprising number of unhappy customers across the two days, actually. Another poor chap had checked-in then gone to his room, only to discover the receptionist hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t returned his credit card. In the short time it took for him to go back to the front desk, the card had gone. The receptionist had left it sitting on the desk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in easy reach of people on the other side of the counter. The staff response was lacklustre and at times dismissive of the obvious seriousness of the situation. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if his card was ever found. Other observations? There simply aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough staff to cope when the hotel is busy, unlike previous years when the Shangri La (ANA) used to pride itself on a high guest-staff ratio. Our party of 12 waited 15 minutes for service in the lobby lounge bar which is supposed to be table service, only. We got our drinks only after we went to the bar and ordered them directly. The room service number was constantly engaged, every time I dialled it over the two days, so I called the hotel operator who put me through\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to an answering machine! The breakfast caf\u00c3\u00a9 on the first floor is a shambolic nightmare\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 too small and pokey with pylons in the wrong places and the various food displays laid out illogically. With a hundred-plus guests trying to navigate around narrow aisleways, pillars and each other, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positively claustrophobic. And again, simply not enough staff to cope with demand. As other reviewers have noted here, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOpera House View\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room we were assigned was seriously misrepresented. Of the four windows in our large bedroom plus sitting room suite, the Sydney Opera House was visible from just one widow IF you stuck your face against the glass and craned around to an extreme angle. The other windows looked out to a high-rise apartment block and the Harbour Bridge freeway. Nasty. Most of the above things happen from time-to-time at all hotels, even the good ones. But we and our fellow travellers were left with the distinct impression that this hit-and-miss style of operation is the norm at the Sydney Shangri La. I suppose if my wife and I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experienced the Shangri La in its former ANA life, our expectations would have been lower. But is that a satisfactory excuse? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think so. By Australian standards, The Shangri La is an expensive 5-star hotel, one that trades on (and charges dearly for) some superb views of magnificent Sydney harbour and a long-held reputation for quality. Our experiences and observations of those who shared the hotel with us, this time around, indicate that management has a lot to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a lot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to bring the Sydney Shangri La back to the standards it was once renowned for.

Our son wanted to read and we asked for a table with more lights (there were plenty of empty tables). She promised to bring a candle. We waited and finally asked another gentlemen whether we could move or get some light. Again, meet with uncertainty and a promise of some more light. Finally, got up and asked the hostess again, finally she agreed to move us. My wife and I did enjoy the buffet which had a wide selection of hot and cold foods. My son though, wanted pasta (even though the buffet was free for him) so we ordered him a pasta dish.

It had taken some doing to talk my hubby into staying at the Sydney Shangri-La, with an Opera House view. I finally succeeded by suggesting we book the Horizon Club, thereby saving on breakfast and dinner (more about that later). When we arrived early, which was no problem, we were ushered to the 30th floor Horizon Club lounge for private check-in. We were told, \"Your room is ready, but we can offer you a very good rate on a better room. Would you like to see it?\" Of course we wanted to, if only to sample the view! She first showed us our room with the Opera House view. It was perfectly lovely and acceptable. Yes, you had to look sideways to see the Opera House, but it did provide a good, full view of it. Then we went to room #3313. No. 3313 -- one of the famous #13 rooms, as someone referred to them -- was a corner room (sort of a junior suite) with commanding view of the harbor, including Harbor Bridge, Opera House, The Rocks, the inlets and outlets all the way to the Pacific and, from the side windows, a city view. The price would be $80 Australian more per night than the room we booked originally. Having just barely talked my husband into the Opera House view, I told him it was his call. He said, \"We'll take it!\" And it was so worth it! I spent so much time looking out those windows and thinking, \"This is what people come to Sydney to see.\" It was beautiful, day and night, and we saw the most incredible rainbow from there -- double at times -- that made almost a complete circle. I read some reviews that the property was not 5-star quality. I don't know where these people are used to staying. As others have said since, the service was outstanding. I was called by name when I entered the Horizon Club. And as for the food there, breakfast was more than a continental. There were boiled eggs, trout, lox, cheese, fruit, and a variety of juices. The breads and pastries were all of good quality, and cappuccinos and lattes were available for no charge. However, if one preferred a larger breakfast, the Horizon Club level allowed for the full breakfast in the downstairs cafe. We did that one morning. It doesn't have the great view of the harbor that the Horizon Club does, but they served everything you would expect at a breakfast buffet at a good hotel, including cooked-to-order omelets. The price would have been $76 Australian for two, (no extra charge for cappuccinos), but again, it was all covered in our room charge. For dinner, the Horizon Club had sushi, assorted hot fish dishes, a few other hot items, fruit, cheese and crackers, bread, small desserts -- what am I forgetting? Also mixed drinks, and good wines and champagne for no charge. We thought it was well worth the upgrade to be in the Horizon Club. As for our room(s), there was an entry area with window seat overlooking the city and a closet with safe. From there you turned left into a hallway that led to the main room. Off the hall was a beautiful bathroom with soaking tub and separate shower. The only negative thing I have to say about the hotel is that the tub was very narrow. I'm a size 8 and I felt cramped in it. The main room had a loveseat, upholstered chair and coffee table, in addition to a king-size bed and all the usual (TV, bar, desk & chair, etc.). So you had the feeling of separate rooms and spaciousness. When we left, my husband checked out in the Horizon Club lounge while I stayed with the luggage near the elevators.

I emailed the hotel after I'd made the booking to inform them of the special occasion (hoping merely for someone to say congratulations when we arrived) and received an email from a guest relations officer stating that she would personally ensure there were 'a few surprises' in the room waiting for us upon our arrival. To say I was excited is an understatement. Firstly, the highlights. Again, the view! We were on the 29th floor and the view of the entire harbour was superb. The bathroom was fantastic although the blue painter's tape down the right hand side of the vanity unit in the room seemed a bit tacky for a hotel of this standard. The room was a good size, the wide window sills perfect for harbour gazing, and the bed was as good as others in similar establishments we've frequented. The package also included breakfast for two at Cafe Mix on the 1st floor. There was an excellent range of food and beverages that would satisfy most guests. Now the lowlights. I had arranged to check in to the hotel at 1400. Upon arrival, we were informed that our room was not ready and while it was on a priority list it was unlikely that it would be ready before 1500. They'd call us if it was ready sooner. We then deposited our luggage with the porters and were assured that it would be taken to our room when the room was ready. The Perfect Pamper package states that herbal tea is served upon arrival. None was offered but we figured that it would be when we checked back in later. We wandered off to Circular Quay and returned at 1530. The room was ready. I opened the door and said \"surprise\" to my husband but I was surprised instead. There was nothing out of the ordinary in the room. Not even our luggage! Herbal tea was still not offered however there were herbal tea bags up in the room...we thought that perhaps this is what 'served upon arrival\" meant. Having not stayed with this particular brand of hotel before we were unsure of what to expect. 45 minutes later our bag arrived. No sign of anything else. As we'd organised to go to a movie and dinner afterwards we'd hoped to use some of our 'deluxe spa pack' before we headed out for the evening thinking that it would be in the room when we arrived. I visited reception down stairs and a helpful staff member (Rylie I think her name was) rang housekeeping and offered to get our spa pack for us herself as they were short staffed. Satisfied that something would be done I went back upstairs. Approximately 30 minutes later another helpful staff member arrived with our spa pack. When I enquired about the strawberries and chocolate I was told that they would be at least another hour as the pastry chef was running behind. We were offered a bottle of house champagne to make up for the inconvenience. I also mentioned what had been promised in regards to the 'surprises' for our anniversary (although I had no idea what the promised surprises were!). Again, the helpful staff member said she'd chase it up. We arrived back from our evening out at approximately 2130. Our champagne and strawberries and chocolate were sitting, waiting for us with a card from a guest relations officer congratulating us on our anniversary. The champagne and strawberries were now a gratuity for our anniversary rather than a) an apology and b) a part of the package I'd paid for. I must add, the chocolate coated strawberries were the most ripe I've ever had and an absolute delight. By this stage though, I was horribly disappointed with the overall experience. Yesterday afternoon we came back to the hotel after a morning out to find that our key card would no longer take us to our room even though the Perfect Pamper package includes late check out until 1600 and I'd informed the staff member who checked us in that we would be using it. I went to the guest relations desk and was whisked off to reception by Emily who again, was very helpful. The cards were fixed for us and she asked whether the rest of our stay had been to our satisfaction. I shared with her the disappointments that we'd experienced and she noted all of the issues down, took my mobile number, and came and apologised to my husband. She also gave us her name on a card so that we could deal with her personally to make future bookings. Back upstairs to our room. House keeping had not been around to service the room yet and consequently our 4 sachets of instant coffee had not been replaced - so we were not even able to have a coffee in the room before we left. Housekeeping did ring while we were in the room and asked if we required service - it would have been nice if they'd come through that morning. We ended up making herbal tea with the teabags in the room - we never did have tea made for us on arrival or anytime thereafter. While it is but a small issue, it was just another irksome thing that detracted from what should (and definately could) have been an exceptional stay. We checked out at approximately 1515 feeling very let down. While I appreciate the attempts that the staff made to try to rectify issues for me, it was too little too late. This is not the level of service that we have experienced at other 5 star establishments - regardless of whether our stays have been for business or for special occasions. I had thought that perhaps other reviewers had just been unlucky but it would appear that there are issues in the organisation of these requests. While I was greatly disappointed by the forgetting of the promised 'surprises' I do understand that the hotel is under no obligation at all to perform these extra services. However, I cannot understand the lack of co-ordination of the paid for, packaged inclusions. If the packages are difficult to administrate or short staffing on public holidays is the issue perhaps not offering the service in the first place (and especially on public holidays) would be a less frustrating experience for all rather than guests feeling let down. I appreciate that it was a public holiday and that staffing levels were more than likely not at their usual numbers and I'm sure that many people have wonderful experiences at this hotel. That said, I doubt whether we will be taking up the guest relations officer's offer of dealing with her personally to book into the hotel again. In closing, a wonderful view, staff who tried to be helpful, but a poor performance in the end which resulted in our 'special day' being a major disappointment. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this review with other travellers or the hotel management.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warwick, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLOVED the view\u201d", "Author": "asha", "ReviewID": "UR20399161", "Content": "We stayed at The Shangri-La Dec last year (about a week before Christmas) We booked the premier grand deluxe harbour view rooms and BOY was it worth it.

Shortly after arriving we were personally greeted by the manager, Mr Weeden, we thought this was a really nice touch. We were also given a gift of chocolate - which was delicious. The room was big and nicely decorated. The bed was huge and so comfy we struggled to get out of it! The view from our room was simply unbeatable. We could have quiet happily spent all our time in the room staring out the window, it was just stunning. We also slept with the curtains open so we could wake to the sunrise over the harbour - beautiful! The hotel has a restaurant, Altitude, & bar ,Blu, on the 36th floor. The 1st evening we went to Blu it was a saturday night and it was really busy, there was a buzzing atmosphere, being so busy unfortunately there were no seats. You have to put your name on a waiting list, you'll wait even longer if you want a window seat. So we got some bubbly and perched ourselves at the bar and soaked up the atmosphere. We also ate in the Altitude restaurant - booking is advised because it can be very busy. I booked 3 months in advance and was the first person to book for that evening and yet when we 1st arrived and decided to look at the restaurant we were told we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guaranteed a window seat! On the evening we ate there, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very busy and we got our window seat. The food was good although the portions were a little small. After our meal we went into Blu which was a lot quieter than it had been the previous evening and we easily got a window seat, so we got a bottle of bubbly, sat back, relaxed and stared out at the fabulous Sydney night line. Altitude & Blu are a must if you come here! We found all the hotel staff to be very friendly, the concierge team were great! We wanted to take a tour to the Blue Mountains, but weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keen on the idea of getting on a bus with 50 other tourists. We spoke to Nathan who recommended we take a private tour with a guy called Nick, he called Nick that evening for us and made all the arrangements for us and the next day we took the tour and it was brilliant! On another occasion we asked Shane if he knew of any dive shops in Sydney, he checked on the internet, called the shop to check they stocked what we needed then gave us directions. Excellent service!

Room service has always been good. No complaints or gripes from me at all about the rooms or facilities. The staff are first class. Whenever I've required assistance with travel plans, documentation or business facilities (prints, faxes etc) this has been provided quickly, efficiently and with the minimum of fuss. To top it all I had a huge favour to ask recently - I'd purchased a large painting from a nearby shop as a present for my wife but as I was in Melbourne I had no means of getting it to a friend who was driving from Sydney to Melbourne that night ! The Resident Manager, Rob Weedon, was absolutely outstanding. He arranged to collect the painting, take it to the Shangri La, have it wrapped and then walked round to the hotel that my friend was staying at. There was only an hour or so to arrange all this and he, and his colleagues, were terrific. They went to work immediately and ensured the painting arrived safely into Melbourne the following day. I'll always be extremely grateful. A sign of a truly great hotel - fabulous customer service and nothing is too much trouble.

The concierge and others really went out of their way to assist with baggage issues (Qantas).. The views from upper floors are spectacular. Everything costs money at this hotel, and the TV channel selection is dismal.. beyond dismal. The breakfast buffet ($40) is outstanding, but not worth the money. The room was spotlessly clean. On a SAT night, a bottle of Shiraz was left in the room, with slippers, and turn-down service. This hotel is managed very well. Spacious bathrooms, DSL, wireless for business. I was amazed at the number of children in this hotel. There were more families than business travelers. That leads me to my complaints. I heard doors slam at all hours of the night(s). There was an family next-door for 4 nights and their kid screamed at the top of his lungs 24x7. He ran up and down the hallways until 11:30 PM nightly and I saw him playing soccer in the hallway until Security came and yelled at him. On the other side of me, I heard doors slam and a couple having a huge fight (through the walls). For such a nice hotel, how can this place be so damn noisy?? Thin walls. I had to move rooms because of the family next-door. It just got to be too much with the kid singing and screaming (like 3 years old, Asian kid). So I moved rooms. I still heard the doors slamming all night long.. just BAM!!! BAMM! BAMM!.. It was unbelievable. Other than this, if you are a sound sleeper, and not jet-lagged as I was.. meaning I was hardly able to sleep as it was due to the long flight, time difference, etc. I stayed here 14 nights, fyi, so I got to know the place. The bar atop is amazing, a must-do. The staff is charming, approachable, nice, and just downright great. I really mean this sincerely. They gave me maps, dinner recommendations and just made me feel welcome. That being said, I did choose to check out of this hotel after 14 nights, when an opening occurred at Quay West, behind this hotel. The Quay is an apartment building, with kitchen, living room, and I heard not one door slam there. If you stay at Shangri La, stay on the Exec floor. I was bothered by the fact I really did not get upgraded during a 14-night stay. I tried to move to the Exec floor, where the kids hopefully were not, but was told no, unless I paid $150+ nightly more. I think that's ridiculous. The staff were great, the hotel is in the Rocks area, and there are pubs up Cumberland that are great (turn right out of hotel). Hotel has amazing service, great food, great rooms, but there is a serious noise problem at this hotel. I went with a group of people and we all had problems with the screams, doors slamming, and just noise in general. Even the housekeeping staff lets the doors slam, which surprises me. What can they do? make the doors close slowly.. maybe insulate the walls better. I thought the couple next door was going to kill one another, as they were throwing stuff. I called Security. Why do only I have these problems.. The couple were on their honeymoon, as it turns out.. so I got to listen to arguments, a banging bed at all hours, followed by more arguing. I guess they were making up and arguing. I wish them well, but I got to listen to them, the kid next door singing, running, and doors slamming at night.. all while watching the Discovery Channel, which was perhaps the best non-pay channel they have here. No HBO, Showtime, AUS pay TV, etc.. everything is meant to force you to buy Pay Per View. Beware of the noise.

Above all, we wanted a hotel in Sydney which had amazing views of the harbour\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 My girlfriend and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decide whether or not to pay the extra for the Horizon Club, but the guarantee of a room on floors 30-35 made that an easy decision. As an added bonus, the use of the Horizon Club lounge is great, and adds a certain degree of value when you take into account complimentary (and very nice) breakfast on the 35th floor, free soft drinks and snacks throughout the day and free canap\u00c3\u00a9s / alcohol before you head off for dinner. One day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the suggestion of a member of staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we tried Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Mix on Level 1 for the main hotel breakfast (where there is a full cooked breakfast). BIG mistake, there was a queue for a table, it was packed inside, noisy, cramped and just not very relaxing when you are on holiday. Breakfast for 2 (if we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a Horizon Club guest) would have been $78 AUS, which is very steep for what it was. So for our remaining days we continued to enjoy the peace and serenity of breakfast in the HC lounge, together with stunning views over the bay. The bedroom was fabulous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c every luxury you could want, literally, and even an umbrella in the closet to take out if it was raining. Bed was super comfy, the bathroom luxurious with a huge array of nice freebies. The only negative comment would be the bathtub being quite narrow by normal standards, but still very comfy. Above all, the views from the bedroom were awesome \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the room category we had, there were 5/6 big windows offering 270 degree views. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pull the curtains once, preferring to lie in bed and watch the city at night, and then get treated to lovely sun rises each morning. There was a turndown service provided on five of our six nights (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what happened on the Sunday!), and we were made to feel like special guests. From the moment we arrived, we were whisked straight upstairs by a member of staff so we could check-in at the HC, making it feel like a very exclusive hotel within a much larger five star property (think The Signature within MGM Grand in Vegas). We were concerned about the comments on here re: access to the hotel as people say its up a steep hill. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really nothing to worry about \u00e2\u20ac\u201c true, older or infirm guests may have a problem, but its only one block up a steep hill, as long you enter via the back entrance. Go in the main entrance and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two blocks up a steep hill.

I booked the Shangri La \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Horizon package at extra cost for the additional benefits it offers - as a special surprise for my new wife \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this trip is our Honeymoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we were both really looking forward to staying at the hotel. However the experience thus far has been a complete disappointment. Firstly, we spent 40 minutes in the reception whilst the receptionist muddled around with the computer. After asking us if it was our Honeymoon she said that she would check us in as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only have to wait in a line at the Horizon reception\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We finally received our room keys and were told to go to the 31st floor where unfortunately the coffee service had finished but we could wait there whilst they prepared our room. We had just had a 7 hour trip and really just wanted to relax in our room but agreed to wait. After discovering our key cards didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow us access to the lift we eventually made it to the Horizon club lounge on the 35th floor. We waited for 10 more minutes then tried to access our room, again couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the lift to work so asked the receptionist at the bar (who was very helpful) and she showed us to the 30th floor (where we should have been directed in the first place). Finally got our correct keys and got to our room where we discovered two single beds. IT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S OUR HONEYMOON! So, it was back to the club lounge to complain. One of the staff pointed at her colleague who explained that all king rooms were taken and that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much she could do. After some complaining by my wife she agreed to upgrade us after one night to a king room with harbour view which we were really pleased about. At this point we also had to ask about how the Horizon package works \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d paid extra for remember- as no one had bothered to advise us about the Horizon lounge on the 30th floor where complimentary drinks are provided or any of the other hotel facilities included in the Horizon package. So, after that it was back to lift where key card wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work again. After spending 5 minutes going up and down in the lift we finally got back to main reception to get keys coded again. We finally got into our room one hour after arriving at reception and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not really looking forward to a night spent in single beds! The hotel looks fantastic and the views are something really special but when you are spending almost \u00c2\u00a3800 on a hotel for three nights you expect some level of good service.

The swimming pool is a little on the cold so if the cold doesn't bother you, its worth taking a swim. We sadly left the Shangri La on Saturday 2nd August, we felt we left family behind.

We were made to feel incredibly unwelcome from the offset and a few months on we are still upset by the way the hotel staff treated us. We had booked a Horizon room and I admit the views are great. Being on the 35th floor, however, means you are under the popular bar - the music is so loud you can't sleep. It wouldn't be so bad if, as a hotel resident in the Horizon club, you could go upstairs and enjoy the fun. Sadly, however, we were told that like everyone else (ie: people not staying in the hotel and those not paying significant amounts of money for the pleasure) that we would have to wait in an orderly line. The hotel really knows how NOT to treat its guests. Surely hotel guests should be allowed a drink in the hotel bar? I mean isn't that why we pay for hotels with services? I could recount many examples of why this is a terrible place but here are just a few. Each day when we went to the so so breakfast in the Horizon Club lounge the reception staff looked at us and refused to answer our cheery 'good mornings' - we were left to find our own seats (unlike the other guests who were shown to their tables), had to beg to be served coffee and were once asked how long we would be sitting at the window table as another guest wanted it (even though there were about 20 other free seats). Every so often I would remind the reception staff that we were on honeymoon, and even if we weren't, I'd like my new wife to be treated with respect rather than disdain. This only encouraged their rude behaviour. On one day they phoned us at 10am (hardly late in the day) asking when we were going to vacate our room as they wanted to clean it. I challenge anyone to call that five star service. Each day, at the drinks hour in the club lounge, we had to ask for wine refills even though every other guest was offered top up after top up. Even on the one day in our four night stay when we decided just to drink coffee and juice we found it difficult to get the staff to give us any. Aside from the Horizon Club making us feel like second class citizens it should also be noted the hotel pool is cold and gets extremely crowded. Yes the views are good but you can only stare at a view for so long. I won't be coming back here and have instructed my travel department to prevent my staff from staying in the chain until I receive an apology for the way we were treated. Almost three months on and nobody has responded to my lengthy letter of complaint, thus my review on here. I explained to the staff at the time that I was unhappy and they actually laughed at one point. Isn't it interesting the management of this establishment can take the time to respond to positive coverage on here? I wonder whether they will deem it fit to respond to my complaints, either on here, or by a personal letter? Please take this as an open offer to respond. If you want a true 5 star experience and want impeccable service in a classy establishment check out The Observatory. Sure there are no great views, but the fact that the staff respect their guests makes all the difference. We stayed here for the last part of our honeymoon and were pleased to find good old fashioned manners on display, not to mention a nicer pool and much better breakfasts. The Shang ri la has a lot to learn from The Observatory and should be ashamed of itself for making the first part of our honeymoon so stressful.", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNice experience!\u201d", "Author": "ViennaLover", "ReviewID": "UR17990997", "Content": "I was visiting Sydney for a wedding, and had an extra few days for enjoying the sites.

Bathrooms are also roomy. Evening turndown service is a nice touch, but to be expected from this hotel class. As for the negatives, well honestly, not much. The prices are a bit high, but they are not any higher than the other top hotels in the Circular Quay area. There are a lot of business people using this hotel so the evenings can get noisy in the lobby, but it did not bother me. It might for people wanting a resort type feel. The restaurants are expensive, so I did not partake, but the food descriptions looked good. Overally, a very good hotel. I enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to return.

Reception staff were friendly and we were directed to the Horizon Club for exclusive check in which was speedy and efficient. We booked a Horizon Club Opera King room and were upgraded to a Horizon Club Grand Harbour View room. The room was a good size, very comfortable and well laid out and the view was spectacular! No complaints at all about the room - our TV wasn't working properly and when it was reported it was sorted out without delay. The cd/dvd player was very useful and the stationery/office supplies a very novel and useful addition which I have not encountered anywhere before. The bathroom was large, well lit and the amenities were luxurious and replaced daily. Compliments go to housekeeping who maintained a great standard even though the once when we called to ask for our room to be serviced while we were at breakfast it wasn't done. The Horizon Club however is a different story. The evening snacks offered a good selection - however if you stay longer than 2 nights it becomes very repetitive; the staff in the Club are very unattentative, a student/trainee was doing most of the serving, and to get her attention for drinks was a major effort. Plates were not cleared off the table even when she did replenish drinks and this was not only one night but on all 3 nights we were there. The breakfast selection would have to be the worst I have experienced on a \"club\" level. I took some smoked salmon and when I asked for black pepper; the server made a point of telling me he would have to go down to the 1st level to get some and did I want him to do so. The same applied to the cream cheese I asked for. I did want him to do so and almost 10 minuted later he appeared with the cream cheese, black pepper and lemon wedges. I cannot understand how the club level breakfast room in a hotel of this category would not have black pepper available! We chose to go down to the 1st floor for breakfast after that experience and enjoyed the breakfast down there. Concierge was extremely helpful, as was reception staff. In particular I would like to compliment Ashley who is a great asset to the hotel. When we first made the booking at the hotel; I called Altitude restaurant to book a table for dinner on the night of my birthday. I was informed that they were not taking bookings due to WYD but that they would take my details and get back to me if they were able to accommodate us. They did get back to me at a later stage to say they were in fact going to be abe to accommodate us and I requested a window table, mentioning that it was a celebration of a special birthday. I reconfirmed the booking at lunch time on the day and again asked for the window table. I was told that as we had booked a long time in advance the likelyhood was good but that it could not be guaranteed. When we arrived at the restaurant, our table wasn't ready so we were sent to Horizons bar to have a drink until the table was ready. Although the prices at the time seemed extremely high - on checking with comparable hotels, the prices are on a par with the Sheraton, higher than the Hilton and lower than the Intercontinental. The service in Altitude was definitely not up to the standard we expected and my main course - when it did arrive after 35 minutes was luke warm at best. I can understand that people eat at Altitude for the view, but when you have the same view from your room the food and service have to stand on their own and both were lacking! The prices of both food and wine in Altitude were surprisingly not excessive though. The swimming pool, spa and sauna were well maintained and always clean. The service directory lists a steam room as well however this does not exist. Room service was always friendly and speedy - so no complaints there. The one night we returned to the hotel at about 10.30pm and there were about 15 people waiting for an elevator on the ground floor. After about 5 minutes I actually asked reception if some of the elevators stopped after a certain hour and just as the clerk was going to check where the elevators were- 2 arrived on the ground floor. At all other times they were very fast so I don't know what the problem was at that time. Overall I guess I would say that the hotel has great rooms and achieves excellence in some departments. The Horizon Club definitely needs improvement as it brings down the standard of the hotel dramatically.

We'd hired a car and parked it at the hotel. 90% of the time we called the concierge, the number would be engaged. It would take at least 10 mins of repeated dialling to get through. Quite a few times, we would just go down to the lobby and ask for the car there. On one occasion, the concierge on duty asked us why we didn't call first. We told him the line was permanently engaged. He could have said that he would look into it etc; but all we got was a shrug of the shoulders and a look that said 'too bad'. On another ocassion, we'd arrived back at the hotel at around midnight and we couldn't find one of the concierge staff to give the car keys to. We gave them to one of the receptionists. The next day, we called down for the car. They kept us waiting for 20 mins as they couldn't find the car. When they eventually found our keys, we were told that there were 5 other people in front of us. By this time we had been waiting for 30 mins and were late to meet friends. To the hotel's credit, they did refund the days parking - but the lack of urgency by the staff was infuriating. The last point is that cost of the room service breakfast. AU$9.50 for 3 pieces of sliced white bread that I then have to toast myself is a rip-off. Not to mention the AU$12 for half a grapefruit. The cocktails at the Blu Horizon bar are also ridiculous. We paid AU$50/GB\u00c2\u00a325 for 2 martinis!

The spa is really basic, the sauna small and dark, the pool is indoor (in a city that claims to have 300 sunny days per year) and it's the size of a big bathtub. The changing rooms looked like those of a low-key gym: extremely basic, completely unattended and quite filthy. The other common areas (lobby, restaurants and bars) look ok both in terms of design and maintenance. Overall, this is probably one of the worst Shangri-La property I stayed at, and definitively brings down the name of such a prestigious brand. The funny thing is that, while in Sydney, I read an interview of the Shangri-La\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GM stating that the property had been renovated in 2007.

Returning to the room my husband was still not happy at the outcome so went back to reception and asked to speak to the duty manager who then advised that they were just getting a spa suite ready for us, my husband queried how could they be getting a spa suite ready when we had previously been told it was leaking or had been water damaged!! The service we received was terrible and we feel that if we hadn't complained we would have been stuck with the inferior room whilst paying for a suite.

Our room was a Club Premier Grand Harbour View Room and it was exactly as described on the Shangri-la's web site. It was large, well maintained, comfortable seating and work desk a good sized bathroom with amenities and a large comfortable bed. We had a corner room on the 33rd floor and the view was outstanding. A perfect view of the bridge, the opera house and the harbour all the way to the heads. We watched boats coming in and going out but the best was the sun coming up in the morning. Lying in bed and watching the orange ball appear of the horizon was a treat. There were fireworks the second night not sure for what reason but the view of them was superb. I know not under the control of the hotel but the weather was perfect and I think that was a help in our experience. Breakfast at the Horizon club floor is a simple affair. I am not much of a breakfast person so fruit and a Danish pastry along with coffee and juice is fine for me but my wife prefers the full breakfast so for that you go down to the restaurant on the 1st floor. The drinks and canap\u00c3\u00a9s at the Horizon club floor of an evening watching the sunset was great. I must say that I had to be careful with the drinks as they are extremely generous with the amounts they pour and the canap\u00c3\u00a9s were delicious and all this is included when you stay on the club floors so coupled with the improved view its worth opting for these floors. Something else you also do your check in and check out at the Horizon floor and the personal service given is a plus in my opinion. I loath arriving at a hotel then standing in the lobby checking in. On the subject of checking in we arrived with a hire car that had to be returned to Avis. I was tired and harassed from the drive through the city. The concierge who greeted us in the drive was a great start to our stay. He was pleasant, helpful the full gamut of superlatives and settled my frayed nerves in moments, took care of the car and luggage had us escorted to the Horizon floor and suddenly this horrifying trip through the city was a fading memory. We had drinks at the restaurant and bar on the 36th floor. The food was well presented and tasty the menu had a good range of choices. The bar is staffed by extremely capable young bartenders all franticly mixing cocktails. My martinis were nicer than I make myself and I tend to use that as a guide. The Sommelier Tom is very knowledgeable and will guide you in a suitable selection to compliment your meal and is a particularly pleasant person to speak with.

The previous night we spent at the Park Hyatt so we were looking forward to comparing the two high end properties. Check in was slow and at 1.30pm room was not available, but we could take a similar room on the 5th floor or wait for our assigned room on the 22nd, we decided to have a walk around Sydney for an hour and wait for the higher floor. The wait was worth it, the corner suite was magnificent, the views so stunning we were tempted to spend the rest of the afternoon swilling Moet, and enjoying the views. We had a dinner booking in the hotel's signature restaurant, Altitude on the 35th floor, which was pricey but the quality food, service and overall experience was worth it. The bed so comfortable it was almost worth the cost of the room and I was looking forward to a lazy Sunday morning reading the Sunady paper in bed looking out over the harbour, but to my surprise no paper......so off downstairs to breakfast and a paper. Buffet breakfast was adequate without being lavish, service levels not quite up to scratch. In comparing the two hotels we considered that the Shangri La was overall better value and provided far better Harbour views, but the personal service of the Hyatt staff was far superior. Next time we will try out the Four Seasons.", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cGood, but not quite good enough\u201d", "Author": "HongKongMember", "ReviewID": "UR10850225", "Content": "I had booked a Horizon Club room for a recent 2 night stay and was upgraded to a harbour view suite.

At check in we were initially offered a room on the 7th floor, however having read previous reviews we requested a room on a higher floor - got floor 28. Beware of lower floor rooms - there is a highway that runs past the hotel, so possibility of noise and certainly a spoilt view!! The room was spacious and the view awesome - to our left the Harbour Bridge and to our right the Opera House. Two large twin beds, tv, Tea/Coffee facilities, large bathroom with bath & separate shower. The room had a safe and if you wish Safety Deposit Boxes are available through reception (free - but don't lose the key it will cost you $AU300). A newspaper is delivered to your room each morning, and the beds turned back in the evening. Bathrobes & slippers provided in the room - very handy if you go down to the pool! The pool and Gym are on the 4th floor. The pool was a bit murky but of a reasonable 15m size (and very quiet). Water was a bit chilly but the spa pool made up for that. Didn't use the gym but it appeared well equipped and quity busy. You can book treatments in the spa or visit the hairdresser. There is a gift shop in the basement - we thought it may prove expensive, but was certainly on a par with, and sometimes cheaper than, other shops in the area. Breakfast in the hotel is quite expensive, however if you go out of the hotel's rear door there is a little coffee shop (Gloucester Street Pantry) which offers a selection of pastries, sandwiches, cakes, fruit cups etc. There is a pub (Harts) next door to the hotel - a bit like stepping back to the 70s. If you just want a quick, basic bite to eat then its handy, but certainly dated compared to the many restaurants you wll find around Circular Quay. The hotels own Altitude Restaurant on the 36th Floor offers fantastic food with views to match (smart dress). The hotel is located in the Rocks district of the city and within easy walking distance of the bridge, opera house, circular quay (train station, ferries and restaurants) The Queen Victoria & Strand Shopping centres and Darling Harbour are walkable (approx 15-20mins). Be aware that the hotel is on a hill which is fairly steep (especially if you decide to walk from the station pulling a couple of heavy suitcases)!!

I've been to Grand Harbour rooms in evey 5* hotel in Sydney, and the views from their Deluxe Grand Harbour View rooms cannot be toped, ever. The area in front of the hotel is a heritage site, so the views will never get blocked. Dont go for the Deluxe Opera House Rooms. They are partial views (cant see the harbour bridge). PLEASE DONT. Pay the extra $40 or so and get a room with one of the best views in the world. If you feel like spending a bit more, go for the Premiere Grand Harbour View. Its a Junior Suite on the corner of the hotel (room number 13 in every floor). Its got a panoramic view, with windows all around the corner, and the bed facing the window!!! (also known as the honeymoon suite). Its absolutely lovely. Also, request floors 12 - 18 (this way you see the opera house when laying in bed!!!) The Executive Grand Harbour Suites are stupid. They are more expensive, on the other corner of the holel (view not as great) and the living room makes the guest room very small. Go for the Premiere, unless you need a separate living room.

The bathroom was fully tiled in travetine marble and was very roomy with a great bath as well as a shower recess. The toiletries provided were of good quality and were replaced twice a day as necessary. The towels were huge and luxurious. The only downfall was the breakfast. It just wasn't up to 5 star hotel standard. There was only one chef cooking omeletes and he was extemely slow. All the other eggs eg. scrambled, poached and fried were all pre-cooked. My husband chose fried eggs one morning and they were freezing cold as they had been sitting on a plate with no warmer underneath. The bacon wasn't crisp and the sausages weren't good. There were plenty of Asian selections and we both realized that as this hotel is part of the Shangri-la group, it would be geared for overseas visitors from Singapore, China and Malyasia. Our breakfast was included in our room rate, but if we had to pay $38Aud p.p. for breakfast then we would have found somewhere else to eat.

My experience there was generally better than other similar 5-star hotels in Sydney, in terms of service and views the room offers, although I won't rate it the best. The good points 1. View was great and unblocked. Stayed at a grand harbour room with views of the harbour, opera house and bridge. The view was good, but not great as we were given a room on a pretty low floor which was a little disappointing as we'd paid more hoping to enjoy a better view. 2. Level of service was generally better than other 5-star hotels in Sydney (having stayed at others like Intercontinental and Marriott Sydney Harbour), although the porter who brought our luggage to our room on check in was I thought, a little unfriendly. 3. Within short walking distance to Circular Quay. For someone who enjoys an early morning walk along the fantastic harbour that Sydney offers, this is a major plus point. Now, the bad points. 1. Bed was rather uncomfortable for a 5-star hotel, especially for a Shangri-La. I've stayed at Marriott Sydney Harbour, Intercontinental and Sheraton and the beds there were much comfortable, at least more to my liking, especially Marriott's which I think was the best. 2. Not the best rate is offered to hotel guests. I initially intended to stay one night (as Sydney was meant to be a short stop over en route to Singapore after our holidays in Cairns), but decided to extend it for another night. The front desk offered me a standard rate which was more than what was offered on its hotel web site the previous night when I checked. This was highlighted to the staff who insisted that rates fluctuate with demand. I could have rejected the offer and went back to my room and book a room through Shangri-la's web site, but decided not to go through the hassle. The difference was only A$10-15 but I thought it was only right that existing hotel guests not be made to pay more than those who haven't even checked in, bearing in mind that I'm also a member of Shangri-la' Golden Circle. 3. Not given a welcome fruit basket when it 's supposed to be offered to members of the hotel's Golden Circle. No big deal but I thought that a hotel of Shangri-La's standard wouldn't have overlooked such finer details.

I stayed in an Opera facing room on one of the Horizon Floors. The room had one spectacular view over the harbour while the other windows faced a neighbouring apartment block, making it ideal for a remake of Rear Window. Room layout was more akin to a suite albeit that the sitting room had no phone or television and was as appealing as a dentist's waiting room. Can't comment on the food as the last thing one does in Sydney is eat in. The hotel's pool is small at 15 metres and had the water clarity of thick soup. The staff in the gym didn't seem overly concerned and thought it might be the chlorine levels or the filter.

I was expecting free internet in my room for this price, so was a little surprized to find out this only applied while in the Club Lounge. The lounge is open from around 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM.

Lots to drink, and OK eats - although a little limited. IMPORTANT: You can have the FULL breakfast buffett in the main dining room at no extra cost if you book Club level. This is highly recommended. Room was nice, clean. Very large bathroom with nice amenities. No complaints here. The corner room was nice as it had corner windows and a expanded view, but there is a very small and strangely placed living area just as you enter the room, and then down a long hallway to the bedroom. Never used the \"living\" room. Kinda weird layout. Breakfast generally very good, although I would not recommend going just upon opening, they are generally disorganized. Ordered room service once - hamburger well done. Received it medium at best, and not very good at that. Overall the food at the Shang is not memorable at all. Except for breakfast eat elsewhere when you can. The day Concierge was extremely helpful, recommended sights, gave good directions, overall excellent. Location of the Shang is very good for sighseeing - close to the Rocks, museums and ferries. There seemed to be a lot of groups hitting the Shang - at times it was a long wait for an elevator.

But over all my stays I've had the opportunity to try different rooms, restaurants, health club facilities etc so I'll try and give a run down on each. Rooms - size wise, the rooms are very generous, especially when compared to the Four Seasons, and if your budget allows, try and secure one of the Full Harbour View rooms, however be aware that some of the Partial Harbour View rooms can obstructed by your view into the Four Seaons. Room decor is starting to show its age but still very comfortable overall. Bathrooms are also large and spacious, and better than FS, but Westin bathrooms are much better. Internet charges are somewhat on the high side too but comparable with other hotels. Service - service is generally attentive without being spectacular, not as good as Four Seaons but way ahead of the Westin. Check in is usually prompt and friendly but check out can be rather hectic during peak times. Food - room service quality is average and somewhat pricey. Altitude restaurant has great sweeping views of the Harbour, food is good but once again you are definitely paying for the view. Rather dissapointed with portion size as well. Breakfast in the cafe downstairs (Cafe Mix) however was great, fantastic variety and service was excellent. Staff there do a wonderful job. Health/Spa - needs improvement, spa/health club services (such as massages) are ok, but much better at FS. Use of gym is free (unlike the ridiculous $20 charge at the Westin) and gym will generally cater for all needs.

The Horizon Club level was only one floor above our room so going there for the view didn't make sense to us either. The location of the hotel is pretty good--it's right in the middle of The Rocks and if you are young and urban and professional you can go mingle with your peer group in the bar upstairs.

Breakfast was on the 36th floor in Altitudes restaurant, and very mediocre. Food was only warm, air temp was too hot (great views, big glass windows but not enough air-con).

We later spoke to another couple at breakfast and they had the suite under ours (34th floor) and they said they could hear the noise too. When we complained we were told to go and wait at Reception and the Manager would see us but after 1/2 hour nobody came. We ended up complaining to 6 different people during that day but still no action. It took us almost 19 hours to get to talk to someone who would listen. We ended up moving into another room on a lower floor and shortly after we moved in someone from the next room came through the adjoining door into our room which of course hadn't been locked!

We arrived at the hotel a little early for check in so we left our cases for an hour or so with the bell desk, and went for an explore around the Rocks area. On our return, the room was ready and up we went to 13th floor. I was actually quite concerned about our room being on floor 13 as to me, it sounded quite low down. As we had booked a Premier Grand Harbour View room with a high floor request, I was concerned that we might have buildings obstructing our view. However, I shouldn't have worried. We were given a corner room and the view was absolutely breathtaking. We had an absolutely perfect view of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, which I could even see when lying down on the bed! The view was literally picture perfect. Being a corner room, we had huge windows all down 2 sides of the room which not only gave us the stunning view, but made the room very light and bright too. The room itself was beautiful. It was very contemporary and was decorated in lovely, neutral tones. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was absolutely huge. The amenities in the room were good, although I was surprised at the lack of a free local newspaper and bottled water in the room which is usually commonplace. We purposely chose to be in Sydney for our wedding anniversary, something which our travel agent back home had clearly mentioned during the booking as within a few minutes of being in the room, a bottle of sparking wine, some chocolates and a handwritten card was brought to us which was a nice touch. We ate once in Cafe Mix for breakfast, which was very good. I thought the choice available was excellent. Twice we ordered room service breakfast as we had early starts for tours and both times they arrived promptly and with everything present and correct! The staff we found to be patchy. The servers in Cafe Mix and the people who brought our room service were nice and polite. One member of staff who went out of his way to help us was actually one of the doormen. On the day of our anniversary, we had booked to go on a seaplane for a picnic on a beach. We waited at the front entrance for our transfer to arrive and it basically didn't. After 10 minutes, the doorman asked us who we were waiting for, then took it upon himself to find the phone number of the company in question and ring to find out what was going on. When another 10 minutes later they still didn't arrive, he rang them again. In the end, he put us into a taxi and told us to hang onto the receipt so we could claim the fare back from the company which we did. He did all of that without us even having to ask him to which we thought was a mark of very good service. However, what let the staff down in our case was the front desk. The gentleman who checked us in originally was a bit aloof, and we found we had to deal with him again for a problem during the last day of our stay. We came back to our room after a day out to find a curt note asking us to contact the front desk about our check out time. My husband rang them to find out what the problem was and it turned out that they were trying to kick us out a night early. Because of a problem with one of our flights, we had to add an extra night on in Sydney with our travel agent which he added on at Shangri-La and had confirmed with them many months in advance. This was also reconfirmed upon check in. However, the person on the other end of the phone was extremely argumentative and basically accused my husband of lying about the extra night we had booked. It wasn't until my husband told them in a rage that we would be coming straight down to the front desk to get the matter resolved that by the time we got down there, they sheepishly admitted that they'd located the paperwork but still took our itinerary from us to photocopy as proof and gave us no apology. On our return to the room, we immediately had a phone call from housekeeping asking us when we would like our room cleaned (and it had not been done that day because of the check out confusion). I said to them 'about half an hour's time' which they said was fine but when we returned in the evening after a meal out, it hadn't been done. So for these reasons and the lack of a couple of expected amenities in the room, I cannot give it a full 5 out of 5. It's a shame as the hotel is gorgeous and luxurious and the view we had from our room was the thing dreams are made of.

A word of advice - allow at least 5 minutes to walk back, due to the near 45 degree slope you need to conquer in order to make it back. After a few days of this, you will wish they operated a helicopter transfer to take you from George Street upto the lobby on Cumberland Street.

In the same vein, Club lounge breakfasts were dull and with very little choice forcing us to use the main restuarant after our first day - much better. Generally Shangri-la Hotels offer an excellent 5 star service but on this occassion having booked through the group, we consider they were very remiss in not informing us at that time that the Sydney hotel was a relatively recent purchase from another group, and had been acquired in a condition needing sinificant refurbishment. Basically, our Horizon Club room was good but tired and antiquated and with a visible hole from damage in one wall, and it was definitely in need of refurbishment. However, I would be reasonably confident that in time this hotel will be brought up to the groups normal excellent standard. In our case, knowing what a Shangri-la Horizon Club experience should be, and on pointing out the shortcomings we were immediately able to negotiate a far more realistic price. This hotel does have a stunning position, and will be enjoyed by many, but until it is brought up to standard there are other excellent hotel options locally, some also with prime views over the harbour and Opera House.

Nevertheless, the location, in the Rocks area, was perfect for sight-seeing and travelling around the city. My wife use to work for a 5* hotel in Bangkok, so every hotel stay is compared to this. Sometimes our holidays feel more like business than pleasure, as each hotel is taken apart. Not so with the Shangri-la. The standard of the room was fantastic. Reasonable sized reception area, beautiful bathroom and ample bedroom area. The king size bed provided a relaxing night's sleep. Staff in the hotel were extremely helpful, especially the front office staff, and in particular the concierge. On the Wednesday evening we ate in the Altitude restaurant on the 36th floor. The title of 'Restaurant of the Year 2005' was well deserved. My wife and I can't cite any criticisms with the food or service. Every dish was excellent: quality, presentation and size of portion. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable without being pretentious. As it was mid-week we got a window seat which offered views across the harbour including the Bridge, Opera House and extending to the North Beaches etc. Magnificent. Our only criticism was the service by staff in the Blu Horizon bar. We decided to have a drink after dining. Staff took our order quickly enough, but we waited 20 minutes or more for the drink to arrive. Considering the professionalism of the restaurant, we were surprised and disappointed.

I must admit I was nervous booking the shangri-La because I wasn't too familiar with the foreshore area of Sydney and there are many hotels around the harbour who claim to have the 'best' views. It was also because of some of the reviews I read, there was just this element of doubt. anyway to get to the point, this hotel is 36stories with unobstructed views of both the harbour bridge and opera house. It is situated on a slight hill - not as bad as other reviewers think and there are shortcuts down to Circular Quay. Walking to Darling harbour is at least 10mins away. I stayed in room 3207 a horizon executive suit. This type of room is not available on the 'last minute' websites. rooms entitles 'Grand Harbour suite or room' are on the lower floors and are much smaller in size. I strongly suggest you log onto their website as it has a room comparison chart. This room is 83sqm - the sort of size you expect for a suite. It has a seperate lounge room to put your kid(s) on roll out beds - they usually come at a cost but becuase I rang the hotel directly I got it thrown in for free. The room was very well furnished and tasteful. other reviewers say their rooms were worn, well unfortunately I may agree - but only slightly. Put it this way, if the Shangri-La doesn't do another refresh in the next 5 years then yes they would lose their 5 star rating. the bed was a huge King, the bathroom is large and really nice amenties - bath is large enough for 6ft person and two people can fit in shower under large rose head nozzle. Tv, stereo, cd player (no dvd), are all great. Broadband internet access, airconditioning, bed linen, minibar and 2nd ensuite are all excellent.. there is not much at all bad I can say as it was a really nice room. the windows in this place are floor to ceiling, you can sit on the window sill against the window 32 stories high! there is no doubt about it, this is truly one of the most magnificent views anywhere in the world. You can sit in the bath and look at Darling Harbour, lie in bed and see the Harbour Bridge, in the lounge room you look directly at the opera house. Again, I must stress, this hotel and un-interrupted views, it is at the front and all rooms have large windows. I walked across the bridge and looked back to see the Four Seasons hotel with these really tiny windows compared to this hotel. The Quay West Suites are adjacent to the Shangri-La, as I have a kid I might check this place out next time as it might be a bit cheaper. The room cost me $AU500- per night, but as I said before, I rang the hotel up directly and said, I want to pay $500 a night for four nights, the lady put me on hold, and came back and said yes. I got upgraded to the Horizon suite and the rest is history. Make sure you get room 3207 - it is a corner suite so you get 270 degree views. You also get access to floor 30 (although it seems anyone can really go up there, the floor is not blockd on the elevator.) In this room its quite 80's looking but even still it looks good. The service in this hotel is exceptional. Remember though to switch the privacy switch so that they know you don't want to be disturbed. believe me, if you leave it on service, then they will be in as quick as flynn doing this and doing that - turn-down service etc.. The restaurant down on level 2 is fantastic as well. All food in Sydney is expensive so $60- for the buffett including this unreal array of sweets is included. The food is 5 star and variety about right. I must recommend you go there if you have kids - the desserts are fantastic. anyway, I totally recommend this place if you are a couple and find it hard to get a hotel with a seperate room for the kid(s), get quality roomservice 24hrs and be of good quality. This hotel is definitely 5 star, but I wouldn't pay rack rates - negotiate with them. These are really nice and genuine people - it seems anyway. Not too intrusive and always smile and willing to help. As I said, I stayed in the Horizon exec suite - this is probably better than your regular rooms . make sure you visit the website and check out your room size before you book. all rooms have views of bridge, darling harbour, or opera house. Overall, excellent.

The views are fantastic ~ harbour bridge, opera house, circular quay etc. Whilst we found the service to be less than acceptable the views made up for it. (Very 'snotty' service on check-in......wrong room and when we asked to be changed it became a huge deal etc). A club room entitles you to the drinks, nibble, breakfast in the 'Club'. Which is a very ordinary room saved by the fantastic views. The value is however great. Very substantial nibbles from 6-8 each night along with drinks (spirits inc). The breakfast (also inc in the Club rate) is however very disappointing. Not a huge selection, and the same every day so not appealing if you are staying more than 2-3 days. Given the proximity to the Rocks & Circular quay it is a good place to base yourself if you haven't been to Sydney before. The extra payable for a Club Room is made up on the breakfasts & drinks every night & I would recommend that you take up the option. The location is in a steep part of Sydney, so if you are not up to walking up and down hills this may not be the best option for you. The rooms themselves are fairly dated.

However, on entering the \"renovated\" deluxe harbour view room I was disappointed that the room was of a lesser standard than previously. The lovely huge cabinet which previously held a TV was replaced by a cheap looking IKEA table. The room was not as luxuriously appointed as before. The bathroom was unchanged, ie still fabulous. The view from the window was still million dollar and the reason you should stay here, even disregarding the fact that it is not of the same high standard as it was. Staff were very friendly, room service food average (I also note the room service menu has shrunk from about 20 pages to about 6 - one of the reasons I previously loved the Shangri La). But that is economics and I don't hold it against them since they have great eating places at the hotel. My bath tub was not cleaned during room service and this would not have happened before.

Probably the hotel's best feature is the location - it is really close to the Circular Quay and many of the rooms have fantastic views of the harbour. You can easily walk to the ferry terminals, Opera House, etc. It is also adjacent to the charming and historic Rocks area too. The rooms are very nicely decorated and the housekeeping is excellent. Probably the best feature of the rooms is the bathroom - very large and luxurious with a huge tub and separate shower. My only complaint is that my room (a standard twin) was pretty small by luxury hotel standards. On the downside, I was pretty disappointed with the gym and pool area. At best, the gym is like something you would find in a YMCA, not a world-class luxury hotel. I didn't use the pool, but it is really small and there is only a tiny outdoor sundeck. I would also say that the service was only adequate and not stellar. I didn't experience any problems (other than one morning when I went downstairs for breakfast and found that there were propbably 25 people waiting for a table - I didn't have time to wait and had to skip breakfast that day). The problem I had with the service was that the staff just seemed a little indifferent to the guests. Whenever I would pass a staff member in the lobby, hallway, etc. they would never acknowledge me with a greeting. It was not the welcoming feeling I usually experience at luxury hotels.

Upon checkin, everything went smoothly, the staff were very friendly and we had no problems. It was a harbour view room, and it was awesome, even from the 7th floor. Wanted to have dinner in the Altitude restaurant, was boked out though. So decided to go for the buffet restaurant on level 1. This is no ordinary buffet - it was about $80.00 a head, with the most beautiful food I had ever tasted. Maybe the other \"reviews\" who have been there, have been on a bad night, but I have been there 3 times now, and every time I come away feeling totally satisfied. We went to the bar on level 30 also, wow what a bar! It looks out over the bridge on one side, with glass tabletops and glass floor to ceiling windows. Drinks are pretty pricey though, so be prepared to pay upwards of $15.00 for a cocktail. We stayed again in late 2005, this time going for the honeymon suite.

To add insult to injury they lost two pieces of our luggage - laptop and ruck sack - which were eventaully retrieved some 45 minutes later.

Best rooms are 6 to 14 on each floor for the views. Housekeeping is quite frankly the worst I have ever seen, with items being missed (i.e. shampoo etc) left on each day of my 7 night stay, clean towels were not left (on 2 days the towels left were soiled) and the floor didn't appear to be hoovered for my entire stay.

The supposed hot buffet was always cold, the coffee was cold (you always have to ask 2 or 3 times for a cup of coffee and they are not at all proactive) and to add insult to injury they will try to charge you for a full Australian Breakfast even if you only have continental - check your bill carefully. This hotel would charge you for fresh air if they could and is not worthy of the Shangri La brand. Overall the staff are too concerned about how they look to take any notice of their guests, the service is incredibly slow and not at all attentive.

The hotel is expensive by any standard, as is Sydney, but the view alone is worth it, and the location simply could not be better. At night we left the drapes wide so that we could doze off watching the harbor traffic wind down, and awaken to a rising sun and the myriad ferrys going back and forth bringing commuters to their workplaces. The hotel is quiet, staff very good. We only had breakfast in the hotel, but it was everything it should be in a top hotel. Somewhat disconcerting is that complimentary bottled water was not provided even upon arrival, much less each day, as is customary in hotels of this level. A bottle in the mini bar was AUS$10! (did we mention that Sydney is astonishingly expensive?) Take at least one catamaran cruise around the harbor. Take a 1-hr tour of the city on the Red Bus, and consider the 1-hr Blue Bus tour which includes some of the beaches. Take the 12-minute monorail ride. All are worth the time, if not the exceptionally high tarrif (did we mention that Sydney is an astonishingly expensive city?). From this hotel the historic Rocks area is at your feet. We explored every inch of it and were glad we did. If you like authentic Thai food, as we definitely do, experience the casual cantina-style upstairs at Sailor's Thai for lunch or dinner, in the Rocks and barely 5-minutes from the hotel. If you like fusion-style Thai, do try the slightly more formal downstairs room at Sailor's Thai. We liked it enough to eat at Sailor's Thai 3 evenings in a row.

Items were added to our bill that we hadn't had, and were charged $250 for phone calls that we hadn't made. We had to complain to the concierge 5 times before the would accept that we hadn't made the calls. We were disappointed that on Christmas Day they insisted that if you were having breakfast you had to be out of the restaurant by 10:00AM so they could set up the restaurant for Christmas lunch. Fair enough, but it would have been nice if we could get a table for lunch or dinner being as we were hotel guests. Sadly this was not the case, and the concierge couldn't recommend anwhere else and quite frankly couldn't care less. We got the impression that hotel guests came second.

Four Seasons is also good location, but seems rather old and run down. The hill that leads up to the Shangri-la might be a negative factor for some, but we found so many shortcuts up to the hotel from Harrington Road, you just take elevators from the buildings on Harrington Road, and there are exits from the buildings that allow you to skip the walk up the hill.

My husband and I (ages 28/32- no children) are blessed to travel extensively for pleasure and stay in only 5 star hotels. We stayed here for 4 nights recently (Nov.7-11th) as Sydney was our first stop of our Australian vacation (1st time to visit, but definately not last). We paid for a \"Grand Harbour View Room\" and it was worth every penny! Huge, luxurious room with window seat; huge, luxurious marble bath, and of course the BEST view of the Opera House, Harbour, and Bridge. I researched for this trip for 6 months and contemplated between staying here, the Four Seasons, and the Intercontinental. We like large hotels and wanted the best location. I had read that the rooms are very tiny at the Four Seasons in comparison and the building is smaller. The Shangri-La towers over the Four Seasons, making for better views. I did not choose the Intercontinental for the side of the Circular Quay it was located on and the rooms looked nice, but not as nice as the Shangri-La. I still agree now that I have visited that the Intercontinental is not as well positioned if you don't mind climbing the hill to the Shangri-La (only from one direction though). I think people have over exaggerated and over complained about this hill. Unless you're in bad health, trust me it's nothing!! Also did not choose the other 2 hotels due to the fact they are all over the U.S.A. and we wanted to experience a different, but luxurious 5 star hotel. We would definately recommend the Shangri-La and would like to visit some of their other hotels in the future.
