{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Peaceful This was a great hotel with fantastic staff. They were very friendly and so polite.They do not have a fridge in the room but, they did offer the restaurant fridge so I could store my baby's food.If you are looking for something fancy, this is not it. The hotel room was small and the bathroom was very smelly. And is not stroller friendly, it made it difficult for us to bring the stroller up and down the steps but then again Ubud is not really a baby friendly town.We did enjoy our stay. Every morning you were faced with friendly staff who knew my son's name and would take him to see the bird while we ate our breakfast.I would stay here again, once my son is a bit older and can walk the stairs...", "Date": "Oct 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR176336725", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "newmom2newplace"}, {"Content": "Great view, great service! When we first came to this hotel, we were planning on spending just two or three days in the area. But we ended up spending a full week! Every morning, the staff would visit with us as we were having a delicious breakfast, and help us plan our day and evening, as well as giving us ideas for the next day. There was so much to do in the area, we discovered, that we could easily have spent a month there! The room we had gave a fantastic view of the rice fields as well as the lovely swimming pool. The downside was that it required walking down a lot of steps to the pool area, then up two full flights of stairs to get to the room. So, it helps to be quite physically fit to stay at this hotel! The room itself was spacious and clean and decorated with fresh flowers every day. There was even air-conditioning, which most hotels in this area in this price range don't seem to offer. They were having a bit of a bug problem when we were there, but the staff was very responsive when we called them. The pool is large and kept very clean and the setting - a lush jungle, a busy rice field and a flowing river just outside of the pool area, made for a fantastic view. Breakfast was made to order and was quite good with several options available, and served with good, strong, local Balinese coffee. Staff there was really wonderful. Everyone was helpful and took hospitality to a new level! It felt more like a home-stay than an impersonal hotel - I can't say enough good things about the people working there. We were able to book shows through them, and enjoyed the free shuttle service in their clean van to and from the city center (on demand, not on a set schedule, which was nice and very well run). They also have a spa on-site and rent motorbikes at a reasonable rate to those interested. There is a very small library there for those needing books, though many of them were in French. We thought that Artini 3 offered very good value and will stay there next time we're in Ubud.", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR666074787", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tumbleweeds023"}, {"Content": "Lovely and quiet hotel       View overlooking the pool (there are many rooms with this view)", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR818905510", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JoeLikesBali"}, {"Content": "Friendly, relaxing hotel       Rice Fields", "Date": "Jul 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR602126107", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Clarkie2323"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297695-d647119-r20723802-Artini_3_Cottages-Gianyar_Bali.html", "HotelID": "647119", "Price": "$37"}}
