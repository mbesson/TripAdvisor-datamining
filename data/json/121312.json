I'll start with what I liked about my experience at the hotel. Our room was in the south tower, so we had a great view of the southern part of the Las Vegas Strip and could see the Bellagio water show from our room. There are fairly decent dining options in the hotel in terms of affordability and quality. My favorite dining experience was at the quaint cafe, Nosh. It is a great place for a quick \"snack\" if you're in a rush.They charge almost ten dollars for a six inch sub sandwich, but once I took one-two bites of my turkey, bacon sub I felt like it was definitely worth the cost! Be sure to check out Tequila Bar and Grill for their $2 margaritas--the food is nothing special. The hotel is clean and the casino wasn't as smoky as I expected it to be (based on other online reviews). I liked the customer service that was provided by the front desk, especially the bellman that offered to bring my bag out to the shuttle stop instead of having me wait at the desk while he retrieved it. The hotel also provides a shuttle to the Rio hotel that picks up every 30 min. until 1am, which is used my most Bally's guests as a means to get to the Carnival World Buffett (which was nothing to write home about). I thought Bally's was in a fairly decent location in relation to most of the other casinos on the strip. What slows you down is having to walk into the courtyards or inside of the casinos to get where you are going as there is not much sidewalk along the strip. Lastly, the best part of my experience in the hotel was the maid service. I know...they are suppose to come tidy up the room, but we left the room kind of late one afternoon in a rush and returned to made up beds and our things more neatly place on the dresser. Little things like that were very helpful because it seemed like we were always in a rush to get somewhere while we there as a result of trying to fit a lot of activities in a brief trip. Now...on to what I did not like about Bally's. I thought the hotel-casino was quite average. It was more average than I was expecting from an establishment that I have seen referred to as a resort. We did not have much time to watch TV, but they still had the old tube units and the channel selection did not offer much. The beds were okay. I could have used large pillows or an additional pillow because the ones they have on the double beds are fairly small. I knew they did not have free wi-fi, but my friend did not and she paid over ten dollars for one day of wi-fi which I personally think is \"highway robbery\". They had a computer near the elevators of the south tower that you could use to access the internet and print, but they were charging ten dollars for it too. There were a couple of conferences going on at Bally's while we there so I am sure affordable wi-fi ($7 or less/day) would have been beneficial to those guest. Outside of the fact that the hotel needs a few upgrades, my biggest gripe about the hotel was the poor customer service and bland food at the Sidewalk Cafe. Our waiter was very inattentive and most of our service came from the lady who brought us our drinks and one of the hostesses. Other notes: I booked our rooms directly through the Bally's website, but one of my friend's (who was attending the same conference as me) booked a room at Circus Circus on one the main travel websites and received dining and drink coupons from the hotel upon arrival. There were no such amenities offered by Bally's. While it is great to view the Bellagio water show from your room at night, you may not enjoy being awakened by it at three in the morning if you are a light sleeper. Just be prepared and do not forget to close your curtains and you should be fine. There is a liquor store across the street with decent prices for those who want to get the party started before you leave your room. Lastly, Vegas is NOT a pedestrian-friendly city. I think they have a light rail system that actually had a stop at Bally's but it isn't advertised well and it cost $5 for a one-way trip. As I mentioned before the streets are designed to keep you in the hotels rather than for you to be able to walk a straight path down the strip; the crosswalks are minimal. Overall, I would recommend Bally's to someone who is looking for a clean, conveniently located place to stay with good service but no \"bells and whistles\". If you are looking for something fancy or flashy, this is not the place.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evansville, IN", "Title": "\u201cBally's - Good Value\u201d", "Author": "Jomoin", "ReviewID": "UR126503152", "Content": "We spent 4 nights at Bally's from 3/4/12 - 3/8/12.

The rooms are always very clean and the maids do a wonderful job. They are also good sized rooms. We had a room with two queen beds and there was plenty of room and I didn't feel cramped at all. The bathroom is also good sized, with plenty of counter space and room for all your stuff. There are several places to eat within the hotel that are easy, fast and yummy. NOSH is a favorite of ours, sandwiches, bagels and soup are all delicious. There's also a Sbarro, Nathan's, Sushi Bar, Cafe that offers a small buffet breakfast which offers the basics, New York Pretzel and a few other places we haven't tried. So lots of variety to choose from. It's also connected with the Paris which offers some other places for pizza and sandwiches. (Altho I do not recommend Paris' Breakfast Buffet, yuk.) The rooms in the south tower are in need of updating and I believe it's something they are working on. The furniture and headboards are worn, table was wobbly, light switch in the bathroom needed to be wiggled just right to stay on, a strip of baseboard needed to be glued back up, shower head really needed to be replaced.

I was travelling with a large group so if you are doing likewise please notify the check in people so that they put you all in the same area. My group was separated not only by floors but different towers as well. Pricing for this hotel is fantastic, so I didn't mind the decor of the room but if you prefer amenities such as a coffee maker in your room, or flat screen television or two chairs at your small table then I would suggest another location. One plus of this hotel is that there is no resort fee which can sometimes exceed $20 US per day. Even though the pool was not open it was a very long hike from the South Tower. Casino was very nice and the sports book area is a fairly long hike to the east along the shopping mall. This hotel is directly connected to the PARIS hotel and if you are going out for breakfast there is a wonderful location right at the front of the paris hotel with seating outside(heaters) where you can see the Bellagio fountains and enjoy a nice breakfast. Overall I didn't stay in my hotel room very much during my four days but beds were comfortable nonetheless. Tips for a great stay at Bally's get a room with lower number 5612 or 14. Try and avoid the people who are selling the time share promotions. There location is at both main doors and they are persistent. They will lead you in by saying that you can get cheaper show tickets or other perks. Finally if you have the oppurtunity to take a tour or rent a car and you like photo ops go to the Valley of Fire state park north and east of vegas.

They had a coffee shop, but I don't recall a restaurant, but they shared a corridor with the Paris, and that was where all of the food and drinks were.

I knew in booking there, we would be staying in an older hotel, but I was not prepared for the dirt of the room. The carpet was old and there was a huge white stain on it that looked like vomit that had dried but was never cleaned, just vacumed. In the bathroom the main control handle for the shower faucet was broken in half, still functional but not fixed. The lamp beside the bed had a broken on-off switch, as well as the radio was left to full volume with the alarm set to 5 am. What a way to wake up! The hallways have dirt all along the edges of the carpet. Upon entering an elevator there appeared to be a huge white glob that looked like someone had spit up. I've stayed in older hotels before so I know the cleaning of them can be managed. At Balley's, superficial cleaning is the only thing being done there. When we checked out days later, I asked to speak to someone in charge at the desk about the housekeeping. The woman I spoke to did not argue about what I was saying. She stated that carpet cleaning is the only tthing that would remove the stains I spoke of. In the end she indicated she felt that Balley's was only interested in aquiring properties, not maintaining them. At that point I stated I would never stay there again and would be passing my concerns along to this site. The only positive thing I would say about this hotel is its location.

One of the conference attendees stayed in the south tower and said it was pretty bad and run down. It is probably a Vegas thing but everyone in the hotel was on the hustle. The only information desk was located in the walkway connected to the Paris hotel and they were trying to sell some type of ticket package. It got pretty aggravating after a while. I rented a car and getting to the property was a challenge. Access to the property is not clearly marked and you definitely want to avoid the Strip when getting there. Self parking is a huge hassle as they want you to pay for Valet parking of course. You have to walk a long way from the self parking to the room. The TV in the room was the old tube type and hardly any available network channels to watch. Internet was $15 per day which is preposterous in this day and age.

First the positives: It's easy to go either North or South on the strip from here and also to go easily through the corridor to the Paris resturants, shops and lobby to the bus stops. Our lower lever rooms on a non-smoking floor in the North tower were quite clean , quiet, and well kept daily by the maids. Friends in the South tower were on a high level facing the street and had a good view. The hall carpet was a bit weary and worn but not filthy. The bathroom and beds were tops. The view non-existant(roof of adjacent structure). The Tequila Bar had great food at a very reasonable cost for this location, unfortunately they were not equipped tp provide take out breakfasts for guests leaving early on day trips or to catch flghts. The Sidewalk Resturant had a good breakfast buffet for 10.99. I do not gamble so do not know about the casino operations. The staff were friendly and polite with one exception. We wanted to have a senior solo friend moved to the room which connected to ours. The desk person flapped and went on and on about all the work this would create related to both the current solo guest's stay but also regarding a future guest scheduled to arrive in the room connected to ours. It was just a little too over the top when it would have made our lives so much easier. They were not guest focussed! The negative which concerned me was the billing situation where you had to give your Visa/credit card on arrival but never recieved retails of things charged as the hotel sent the bill daily to Visa without verification. On checking out at 0400 of our final day we were only presented with the bill for that day. No itemization was given, however when requested it was finally provided and we discovered several \"daily errors\" had been billed and we would never have known had we not been on the ball. For example an optional safe had been charged daily, we had never requested nor used the safe. A movie was charged to our room and several buffets from Paris resturants were also charged in error. The solution suggested was to contact the hotel during the day time hours to resolve the discrepancies. Friends leaving the same early AM were very pleased with their bill, only to be shocked when we told them of our experience with billing irregularities, they discovered their bill was for the final day only. They will be contacting the hotel for an itemized account of charges sent to Visa and reporting irregularities to Visa. A third friend who was a checked out after us overheard our comments then also requested an itemized account of the whole week finding the same kind of unsolicited charges we encountered. Due to this experience I would not recommend this hotel, as I consider what we experienced to be an intolerable business practice which I could never support regardless of the hotel positives, but others would have to make up their own minds. If you chose to use this hotel 1. be an alert and wary consumer, and 2. check your file at the main desk daily - forewarned is better than regret, as out friends would have simply wondered what the Visa charges were about if they noticed at all, as they do not always check their bill.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sutherlin,OR", "Title": "\u201cTrip to Vegas\u201d", "Author": "cablemanSutherlin_OR", "ReviewID": "UR125466323", "Content": "Got a good deal on Priceline for 2 days in Las Vegas.

My stay was the last weekend of February, 2012. Bally's is an older hotel, but it is clean with unusually large rooms (not just by vegas standards but by any standards), has some of the most affordable rates on the Strip and is located in a fantastic spot, right across the street from the Bellagio, right smack in the middle of the strip. For 54 dollars you can take a town car from the airport, stop by a liquor store, and cruise up the strip (1 hour total). There apparently are no drinking in public laws in Vegas, you can also drink in your cab/town car. They will drop you off right at the door. Unless you have large quantities of luggage, save the tip and ignore the bellhops. The check in counter is about 30 yards in the front door on your left side. There always seemed to be a line, but it went quickly and wasn't an issue. You would probably prefer the South Tour if you can get it, as it will potentially have views of the Fountains of Bellagio (which I found extremely enjoyable to watch). I stayed in the North Tower, and our elevators were fairly close to the front desk and casino area. I would say 50 yards maybe? If you've never been to Vegas (like Myself before this trip) the scope and size of everything is staggering. Everything is proportionally over the top large, so it was nice not to have to walk a mile to get to the elevators to my room. The casino at Bally's is clean and compact, fitting into one main room, it is much smaller than many of the other casino's and not as spread out. The sports book is done a flight of escalators in the back of the casino area, and down a hallway that resembles a mall. There is a sbarro's across the hallway from the sprotsbook. It's average at best, though it was posting fairly decent odds compared to Cesear's Palace across the street. Bally's is connected to the Paris hotel and there is a walkway from the bally's casino floor, that takes you through a simulated paris street, which I found very cool and right into the Paris casino which is way nicer, bigger and cooler looking than the Bally's floor. I didn't discover this hallway until the last night, but I would definitely consider Bally's again based on that easy access (assuming the price point for Bally's was low, as it usually is). I would recommend the Bally's Jubilee show. If you get comped tickets or 2-1's that is fine, don't pay extra high prices- I doubt the show sells out continually. We went to the Sunday night late show and got moved up to a table in front of the stage. I can confirm its definitely a topless show, at least parts of it are. I was entertained by the show's variety, though I would likely not see it again. Something to note, there is no Jubilee show on Fridays and the Saturday 730pm show is not topless. The theater entrance is in the middle of the casino. If you want to head across the street to Bill's Gambling Hall (its sorta a \"dive bar\" casino equivalent) I would highly recommend it, but I would use the side Bally's exit, and cross the street (not the strip) to get to Bill's- otherwise its a long walk involving various flights of stairs to get around along the strip. Bill's has 13.95 prime rib dinner 24/7. I can verify that at 230 in the morning, it was delicious. Didn't eat at Bally's. I viewed it more of a good centrally located place to stay, that was affordable with a nice big room. (Older TV and no fridge being the biggest knocks on the room). Now that I know which hotels/casinos are my style, I will probably seek them out for my next visit, but this is a good place for a first timer.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWent downhill\u201d", "Author": "Lindsay T", "ReviewID": "UR125352738", "Content": "My husband and I always stayed at Ballys.. it's the only place we have stayed at.. the first time we were there, it was great.. we had the best time.. the room was decent.. we walked over to Paris most of the time..

Anyways.. the last 2-3 times we stayed at Bally's we became very disappointed. Our room was pretty disgusting. Since we used our comps for a discounted rate, we ended up getting a nasty outdated room that was far from the casino.. we spent good money at Ballys, very good money.. We felt that if we purchased a nice room to begin with for our first stay, they would match the same room with our comps.. it was a big disappointment for us. The shower felt like we were being sprayed with a fire hose.. Service at the restaurants and bars have declined drastically. I had to go up to the window and get our own food that was sitting there waiting.. the waitress called from across the restaurant asking if we needed anything else.. that was pretty ridiculous.

You could see the sunrise and watch the planes coming into McCarran airport. If you want a strip view then a room in the south tower is your option. As far as we could tell few or none of the rooms in the North Tower have a strip view. The room was one of the Deluxe rooms. Do not go by the picture of the room from the Ballys web site, the room was much older and tireder than pictured. The carpet was stained as were the settees at the ends of the beds. The furniture was worn and the wallpaper obviously patched in several places. The bed was extremely firm but the linens were clean. Be sure to use that do not disturb sign, we saw several times where at 8:45am housekeeping was knocking, they only knocked times quickly, on peoples doors then throwing the doors open and yelling Housekeeping while folks were still in their beds asleep, not a nice way to wake up. The restaurants we tried there were good and the sidewalk breakfast at the Sidewalk Cafe was AMAZING. Enough breakfast for two so unless you have a BIG appetite plan on sharing this one. Sea Thai was also very good and we often eat Thai food and were were quite pleased with the portions and quality of the food served.

Drinks were also VERY expensive at all casinos with a domestic beer usually costing aroung $7-8 and margaritas costing $9 and up. Four drinks were regularly $32+ without tip anywhere on the strip!

We were right. The North Tower rooms (listed as \"deluxe\") were very large, nicely decorated, clean and comfy. I think they are about $20 more than the South tower's unrenovated rooms, but worth it. We had a room with a king size bed, and it included a table with 2 chairs, a small desk, a loveseat and coffee table, and a spacious bathroom, with nice granite tiles, counters and updated fixtures. We were on the 17th floor and had an obstructed view of the strip (we looked over the parking garage, but beyond that could see the New York, New York). The bed was comfortable and had 4 pillows. Even though we were there over the weekend, it was pretty quiet. Sure, you could hear people in the hall in the middle of the night as they went to their rooms, but I find that happens in just about any hotel. The staff was extremely nice, and housekeeping was good. The temp in the room was fine, water pressure and temperature were good, there really isn't anything I can find to complain about. Cable TV is included, but wi-fi is extra if you want it (I think about $12/day--we did not use). The room has a safe, but it also can only be used for a fee ($3, I think, we did not use this either). Bally's is part of many hotels that share an owner--the Paris, Caesar's, the Flamingo, Planet Hollywood to name a few--so we got a sheet of coupons good for different things at these places, but DEFINITELY get the free Total Rewards players card, which also covers all of these properties. In addition to other perks, we got a coupon book & $5 for the slots or tables to spend. Yeah, just $5, but any \"free\" money in Vegas is a plus if you ask me.

As an aside, we travelled the not-too-far distance to the Trump hotel, which is a non-smoking facility - It's beautiful!

Rooms Check-in was a breeze. (arrived around 5pm on a Tueday). We had room 6112, with the $25 upgrade for the roman soaking tub. Um yeah, husband thought this would mean hot tub and really it's just a big bath tub but it did suit his needs as he needed to soak his aching legs after walking all day. And better yet, the room had a single serve coffee maker so we could each enjoy a cup of coffee while getting ready each morning. The room was dated and there were some stains on the carpet but overall it seemed clean. Tons of space, dual vanities, two big closets, walk in shower, toilet stall and a fancy little drinking fountain (oh wait, that was a bidet). Others in the group had the standard room and enjoyed views of the fountains. Some complained of the noise - but in our room we didn't hear a peep. We had a view of Bill's Gambling Hall :) Casino The casino was decent size but small enough that we could find the other members of our group. I even hit an $800 jackpot while there and another member of our group won $900! Sign up for the players card and they give you $5 free play and you'll receive discounts at the shops, including the ones at Paris (probably other sister properties but we didn't do much shopping). Eats & Drinks Had a couple of meals at the Tequila Bar. Husband enjoyed their burger and I loved the $2 tacos and $2 margaritas. We even attempted the nacho platter one night to soak up some booze - should have waited until all 8 of us were there as we couldn't even put a dent in it. Very yummy but HUGE! There were also restaurants downstairs by the shops. They closed at 11 but we did managet to hit up Nathan's one night (look for buy one get one 50% off coupons), and the hot dogs and cheesesteak were good. Several people in our group ate at Nosh and enjoyed their food from there (right by the elevators to the rooms). Location, location, location This is the biggest draw in my opinion. The location was perfect, center strip. Close enough for Bill's drink and breakfast specials, O'Shea's frozen Bailey's, and not too far from Ellis Island's cheap meals (though we never made it there). Right across from the Bellagio fountains and a hop, skip and jump to Caesar's Palace if you're looking for some fancy shopping. Bally's is connected to Paris which has even more fun to offer. At check in we received coupons, including a 2-4-1 ride on the Eiffel tower where we viewed the Bellagio fountain show from the top of the tower at night - very cool. And the casino at Paris was fun too, great music playing there. Also enjoyed the trip to the Sugar Factory and bought souvenirs using our discount from the players card. Overall, this hotel worked out great for our group as it had something for everyone and wasn't so huge that we couldn't find each other when necessary.

Some of the lamps had switches that only worked if you jiggled them just so, and the lighting was so bad that it was almost impossible to apply makeup. The lighting near any of the mirrors was just too weak. It was a nice touch to put a phone into the bathroom, but the receiver was damaged and felt like it was going to fall apart while I was talking on it.

It was once again a pleasant experience with a quick, friendly check in (11am) and nice North Tower room. My rooms have always been comped and have always been in the North Tower. This one was by far the nicest view. 14th floor with a nice partial view of the Bellagio fountains and strip. Once again the room was a nice size, clean, and well stocked with towels. My only complaint would be the pillows. I'm used to the huge, fluffy, soft ones at Ballys in Atlantic City and these were somewhat hard, flat and lifeless. You can't go wrong with the location. Pretty much center strip within walking distance of many other large and small casinos and shopping. There is a little casino/store across Flamingo Ave (north entrance) that is great for picking up a six pack, sodas or what ever little necessities you may need and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for in the Hotel store. Catch the Deuce bus either in front of Paris or Flamingo for $7 (24 hours) and head to Fremont street or the many other stops along the way. There is also the monorail station, but that can get expensive at $5 a ride. They also offer a free shuttle that runs every half hour over to the Rio Hotel and Casino which is also part of the Caesars total rewards family. The Carnival Buffet at the Rio was excellant. Once at the Rio you can catch the shuttle back to Ballys or over to Harrahs on the strip. In the coupon book they give you at check in, one of the coupons is a buy one, get one for the Car Collection at the Imperial Palace. If you are a car lover this is a real treat at $8.95 for two people. Bring your check book as most of the cars are offered for sale. Across the street is Bill's Gamblin Hall. They have good beer specials and a free Elvis show that can't be beat. There is a one drink minimum and get there early as it does get crowded. I think shows were 3pm, 5pm and 7pm 3 or 4 days. I understand that you can transfer comp dollars earned at Bill's to your total rewards account so sign up for a card. It's a fun little casino with good drink service a great Prime Rib special. The Tequila Bar and Nosh are great little places to catch a bite to eat. Beware of the Nachos Grande at Tequila Bar! They are excellant but they are indeed GRANDE!! $2 Tequilas ($3 strawberry), great burgers, pulled pork sandwiches and cole slaw. Nosh has fabulous sandwiches on fresh baked breads. We ate breakfast twice at the Sidewalk Cafe out of convenience. It's ok for eggs over easy, hash browns and toast, but nothing at all special. We passed on the buffet after having had it in previous visits. Service however is fast and friendly.

When I found out I could get a grand \"suite\" for about half the cost of what my employer was booking, I was thrilled. I've always tried to stay and gamble at Harrah's family properties....don't think I'll be returning here. The good: Bally's is in a prime location. Right in the middle of the strip, walking distance to most places. The room was clean. Maintenance and housekeeping were very responsive and polite. I was impressed with that. Other than that... The bad: I feel cheated. I feel stupid. And I don't like places that make me feel this way. The website shows the Grand suite as a gorgeous room with an in room jacuzzi (only available in the north tower I came to find). I booked over the phone and believe (I can't be positive) I was told this. When I inquired about getting the same room in the north tower (after reading trip advisor reviews) I was told there were none available. I can live with that, ok. Fair. I was offered a junior \"suite\" in the North tower. When I inquired about an in room jacuzzi, like I thought I was getting with my original room, I was told that there wasn't one in either room. The picture on the site was simply a sunken tub. Really????? Who on earth wants a plain sunken tub in their bedroom??? Dumb. So I took the Junior \"Suite\". What made it a suite...NOTHING. It was a large room with an extra mirror outside the bathroom. That's it. Absolutely no different than an oversized standard room. Make sure you don't fall for the \"incidentals\". Bally's will try to get you to pay for your whole stay up front but will ask if you want to put a hold on \"incidentals\". How much you ask...$100/night. You've got to be kidding me. Take it if you want to jam up your credit card for the week. That's a heck of a lot of towels. The casino you ask...terrible. Plenty lively. Plenty tiny. Such a large property should have more than 3 craps tables. The only time I could get even near one was early in the morning before work. \"Bills\" right next door is a dive place but it's casino is infinitely better (and cheaper). Don't worry slot suckers, i mean players, there are plenty of these at Bally's. Overall I would never stay here again.

After 2 planes later and being awake for 24 hours, we arrived at the hotel at 8pm on New Years Eve check in was extremly quick and the lady was very polite and welcoming, we had booked 2 rooms for a party of 4, we were assigned rooms on different floors in the North tower, having to use a different set of elevators for each room, we were slightly annoyed but didn't really mind this as we expected the hotel to be busy considering our late arrival on New Years Eve. However, we got over the inconvenience when we realized we had each been allocated a diamond suite at no extra charge! We took advantage of the free phone calls between rooms to make plans rather than use 2 elevators to visit our traveling companions room. The North tower doesn't have a direct view of the strip, if you want a view of the strip, request one but expect to be in the South tower which other reviews say are not as nice as the north tower so if you want a nice room and a view pay more at a different hotel! We only used the room to sleep so didn't need a view as we were out on the strip enjoying the sights. The quality of the rooms were superb, the cleanliness was excellent and the maid service could not be faulted. If we wanted a lie in we put the do not disturb sign on the door and she skipped us until we went out. The bed did fold down from the wall, but it was kept laid and down throughout our stay and was extremely comfortable. We were so exhausted from our days out, I probably could have slept on the sofa in our room, that was also extremely comfortable! Other reviews say its a long walk from the north tower elevator to the exit to the strip, its not that far considering you can walk a long distance between hotels on the strip. I would recommend walking from Bally's through to Paris which is connected, its a pretty walk on the cobbled floor, exploring the french themed shops and cafes. We went to the Guns N Roses concert at The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel for our New Years Eve celebrations, they were superb, Axel certainly didn't act his age. Definitely worth the wait considering we arrived at 9.30 and the concert started at 8 we felt extremely lucky to enjoy the support group and have a relaxed few drinks before the Guns came on stage at 10.30, some people were complaining but this is Axel we are talking about and he can come out whenever he is ready, the performance was amazing and non-stop! Celebrating the New Year was very special and would recommend to anyone if they ever get the opportunity in the future. I would recommend Papillion Helicopters for a helicopter trip over the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam, their service is extremely efficient and reliable and have used them on both visits to Las Vegas, we just rang then from the hotel rather than booking through an agent as it cut out the commission. Both trips were superb and we felt excellent value for money. The hoover dam tour was very informative and the helicopter ride ,over the dam really finished the trip for us. The coach driver, Big O, was particularly funny and interesting, request his coach if you can! If David Copperfield is at the MGM and you like to be amazed, then book! All tickets are one price, $106, if your in a party of 4 you get your own seated table, if your a 2 you may have to share with another couple. He was spectacular! To eat after the show then I would recommend Wolfgang Pucks Bar and Grill in the MGM, the 2 different steaks on the menu were melt in the mouth and extremely tasty, 5 stars! If you like milkshakes then try the Sugar Factory restaurant in Paris, the vanilla malt was exactly like drinking malteasers, and the club sandwich with fries was just what I was expecting, delicious and huge portions, take advantage of the doggie bag and eat the rest as a snack later! My partner and his mum did the Sky Jump at the Stratosphere. It's a controlled free fall from 108 floors, they reported it was an exhilarating experience which is an easy jump before a bungee or sky dive. $125 for the wristcam DVD and jump which is about \u00a380 in the UK. You can guarantee you wouldn't find an experience that cheap in the UK, if your an adrenaline junkie then do it. The view from the stratosphere is well worth the $16 admission up the tower and if you do the skyjump you get a free pass! If your interested in history of the mob and its connections with Vegas then go to the Mob Experience at the Tropicana, we really enjoyed it, watch the short film, it's very enlightening, we watched the Godfather as soon as we were home... This was a second visit to Vegas, but my partners mum and husbands first time, we all enjoyed the visit. Definitely plan your days so your not walking back on yourselves and use the monorail its $12 for unlimited trips within 24 hours from MGM right up to the stratosphere, or $5 for one trip, much cheaper than taxis in that traffic. Also visit downtown, the Fremont Street Experience is well worth the trip up but the area does feel more like the original Vegas, you do see more local vagrants so watch your handbags and cameras, there are loads of security around but I was more wary.

Back to Bally's - on check-in we received a free upgrade to the North Tower and the room we received was fabulous. It was just short of a suite and was beautifully decorated. The service was excellent and everyone in the hotel was very helpful. The casino isn't the biggest on the Strip but the staff are really friendly.

The room was clean, not the most up to date style, but it was creme de la creme a few years ago. One amazing thing about this room was the fact that it was extremely quiet, not a peep from anywhere was heard. We were expecting a noisy stay, but were just amazed. We were there from a Wednesday to a Friday. We could see the Bellagio fountain from the window. Only thing lacking was more tv channels. While there one night we ventured to the Tequila Bar and Grill downstairs, they have two dollar tacos, and we got a pitcher of very tastey margerita. We ended up paying $60 TOTAL for our stay. This hotel does not charge resort fees which was one of the reasons I picked it as well.

I stayed at this hotel way back when it first was the original MGM Hotel (before it expanded) and knew that this was one of the oldest properties in Vegas.

There were no visible stains on the carpet and the bathroom was clean (yes, the tiling/motif was dated but it was still very nice and kept up ). My room faced into the L-shaped area of Bally's so there was little noise except that you could hear the \"whoosh\" of the Bellagio fountains at night when the show was on (luckily the last show ends after 10 pm I think). I didn't hear any of my neighbors and had a restful sleep on the bed (it wasn't the most comfortable ever but it didn't sag and was great for a good night's sleep). All in all, I was quite pleased with the room as for an older hotel, it was in much better shape than the rooms at the Westin across the street (stained carpets, broken door jams, bathrooms that need cleaning/fixing). My only complaint wasn't with the room but with the lack of 24 hour cafe's/dining places in the property-------actually, I couldn't find any place nearby that was open at 5:30am on a Wednesday morning.

This was our 7th time to Vegas and we have stayed at 6 other strip hotel/casinos. We just wanted to find something cheap in a good location. After checking the total rewards website and entering in our information we found out that we could get all 3 nights for free at either Bally's or Flamingo. After researching each one and reading reviews we definitely wanted to go with Bally's. We arrived at check in about 12:45 p.m and were given the option to upgrade to a Jr suite in the North tower ( $25 a night ) from what I had read the north tower rooms had been re-done and south tower rooms were a lot older and run down. The room was ready immediately, so no waiting. We took them up on the offer and were very pleased with our choice to do so. We were almost on the top floor, it was a diamond floor and we had a great view of Flamingo, Caesars, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn Encore etc..., plus we could see the mountains so a bit of everything. The room was huge it had a lot of space. There was a nice clean king size bed with a padded wall behind, 2 bedside tables with drawer space, the bed was comfy but the pillows were not great I got a little bit of a stiff neck in the mornings. A little velvet bench at the end of the bed. Then there was a big TV unit with an older TV that could do with an upgrade, but most people are not in Vegas to watch TV in their room. There is a desk and chair and then a living room area that had a couch, chair and coffee table. The Bathroom was very nice and spacious. Outside of the bathroom there was a large 2 door closet with plenty of room for our stuff. Also there was a separate sink and mirror and then a make up area with a chair. The room had a coffee maker, but no fridge. In the bathroom is a huge sink area, no problem putting out all our stuff, then shower and toilet, darker tile throughout, I was pleased with how clean everything was, the shower was very nice and clean, no grime anywhere or stains. As far as for the casino, it is not that big of a casino, and isn't the most fun casino to be in, but the lounge inside late night played a lot of good music. It has a lot of food options and at reasonable prices which is good for Vegas. A couple of extra perks are that it it is connected to Paris, so it's a nice easy walk to get there and we liked the Paris casino, we also got very good drink service in the Paris casino. The other perk is Bally's has a free shuttle to Rio, it runs until 1 a.m, so that is great because a cab there and back would cost you about $20 or so with tip. We never had any complaints about the hotel, and it's location is perfect center strip. We like to walk a lot and we walked one direction to Encore one day and the other direction to Mandalay bay for the show, never took long. There is obviously a lot nicer hotels on the strip, but for $25 a night you really can't beat that except free like we originally had, but I am glad we did the upgrade after hearing about some of the south tower rooms. Every employee we encountered at Bally's was very friendly. I wouldn't pay more than $40 a night to stay here, but anything less than that I believe you would not be disappointed with your choice.

Conference attendees were forced to walk back and forth between the North and South Tower rooms for breakout sessions, or from their guest room to workshop room. Every single such trip forces you to walk right through the casino where it is loud, extremely smoky and full of flashing lights. Even if you skirted the edge of the casino near the registration desk, you still had to walk through enough of it to get to the meeting rooms. Many of us complained about how all of our clothes would have to be washed or dry cleaned when we got home because the smoke smell permeated everything we wore on any day. And of course, people with health problems were just clean out of luck. The only place to grab breakfast in the hotel? Right there on the casino floor, smoke and all. Even if you were having dinnner in the fine dining restaurant, you were still forced to traverse the casino and the smoky haze just to get to the ladies room. Never, ever, ever, again. Other hotels on the strip make their casinos very easy to get to without forcing every single person who walks in the door to tramp through it, so I know it does not have to be this way.

Stayed Wed to Sat, during National Finals Rodeo week and there were cowboys everywhere! Asked for \"best view of Belagio fountains\" and was given (early checkin at 10 am) a South Tower room on the 22nd floor that had a partial view of fountains with a full view of Effiel Tower and Paris hotel/pool. The room itself was pretty run down with very worn/stained carpets, old TV, hard beds (but ok linen) and a horrible torn up dresser. The bathroom was large, sliding door shower/tub was clean, hot water and pressure good, tons of mirrors, but a huge, distracting stain near faucet that make me say \"yuck\". We seriously considered changing rooms, but then we saw the view and decided the compromise was worth it. We saw many , if not all of the Belagio fountain shows over the course of the trip, and for me, that was a huge plus to the room. The housekeeping was fine, except they DO like to start early and pretty much woke us up around 8 am every morning (ugh!). Also, they had their huge carts always in the hallway almost blocking the looong walk to elevators (which were not slow). The casino at Bally's was just ok, a little boring, but small enough to navigate easily and not get lost. The walkway to Paris hotel/shops was very convinient and nice when it was cold at night. The pool was not open, as it was Dec, but it looked a little boring, but not too bad, just in need of an update. We loved the Tequilla Bar and Grill here for the drink and food specials ~ $2 margaritas, tequilla shots, beer and yummy tacos (chicken and beef, crunchy type). Went here pretty much every evening for drinks. And they are right next to the Indigo Lounge, so we could enjoy the live bands without paying the 2 drink cover there! Very busy place, very tiny though, with not much 'atmosphere\", more like a sidewalk type cafe. We loved the show \"Jubilee\" here too , and even though it was topless, thought it was really well done, with amazing costumes, perfect dancing/singing, and over the top sets. The location of Bally's is also a huge selling point as it it pretty much dead center strip. We were able to walk all the way down to Luxor and up to Mirage very easily. Didn't do too much gambling, a little video poker and slots and cocktail service was always good. Other service personel were friendly as well.

Unfortunately, upon arriving, we quickly noted that the room showed signs of age. The furniture was quite dated and could use a facelift. The bathroom, although clean, showed its age most. There was loose and missing tiles in the bathroom, around the bathtub as well as the along the base of the wall. The grout was stained and could have used replacing. The bathroom fixtures were old and the shower fittings loose. The water pressure was not that great nor was the fluctuating water temperatures great - OUCH! While staying at the resort, there were several occasions where the escalators on the outside exit to/from the strip were broken. I didn't mind this so much at this time of year as the temperatures weren't as scorching, so walking wasn't as bad as it could have been. However, this was an inconvenience for many disabled who stayed at the resort. On a good note - the room that stayed in had a great peek-a-boo view of the strip and we could see a little bit and hear the Bellagio fountains going off. Also, the staff at the resort were very friendly and eager to assist us. The entertainment seemed to be pretty good as there were plenty of people up dancing to the band at the nightclub. The food at the nearby cafe was also good for that midnight snack. If you get a good deal on this resort, I would still recommend a stay here due to it's location.

If you are thinking of staying here remember that it is 22 dollars extra for the gym per person, and the pool is closed for the season, they do not have an indoor one. I should of looked closer before I booked here as this one of my favorite things to do is visit the gym and the pool. I will look into the holiday inn next time. If you want your hair done correctly and proffesionaly, then look to JC pennys, and a hairdresser named EVA. This is probably the best haircut I have ever had, besides my old nieghbours. The kitchen service is good, but they left not only ours, but a couple of more rooms dishes outside the door for two days, it was not picked up until I told the front desk. I thought that was unproffesional. If you have never been to Vegas avoid the front desks at the side of the hotel entrance, and they try and hook you into time shares, or real estates 'whatever', with a promise of 1/2 price tickets, or free show tickets . Go to 'tickets now' which is a walk down the street, you may have to pay more, but you do not have to put up with some deseperate wanker selling properties. I liked this place, but I will not consider staying there again, as I do like the extras at a full service hotel, and do not mind paying extra to have it. My best advice is read everything completely, and do not skim over, the website makes it look great, but does not show the upclose stuff like- cracking ceilings, and worn out carpet, scratched furniture, and old tube televison sets, and holes in the blackout curtains.

The bathroom was small and tv was one of the older tube types but it wasn't an issue. I mostly played the table games (BJ and 3-card poker) and poker machines at Ballys.

My husband had the \"add-on\" LB of king crab legs and it was the largest crab leg meat I have ever seen--and I live on the coast!

We spent a lot of time around the splendid pool area, you would not get any idea that you are in the middle of the Strip, more like some Caribean or Mediterranian resort. The pool itself is better than most Vegas pool, here you can also swim, not just sit by the pool and take occasional dip in the water, the pool is large and deep enough for actual swimming. We did not gamble so no idea of the action there. We spent 3 nights here and enjoyed the relaxed pool and the very central location on the Strip. If you are looking for an economical hotel with some Strip atmosphere, this is a good choice. Not the best hotel on Strip but definitely good value for your money. No need for a car, so you start boozing at breakfast !!", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern US", "Title": "\u201cStay in the North Tower\u201d", "Author": "SuziQ22", "ReviewID": "UR119915654", "Content": "First, my bias is that I'm not a Vegas fan, but came for a family reunion. I had stayed in Harrah's about 10 years ago for a conference and was not impressed, so was glad that the family wanted to stay somewhere different. My cousins and I decided not to upgrade to the North Tower of Bally's like our parents did, and we were sorry we didn't. The family members who stayed in the North Tower were all satisfied. Like many hotels in Vegas, the smoke smell hits you when you walk in, and even if you are on a non-smoking floor, it stays in your clothes/hair. Our room in the South tower was basically an economy room that had seen better days. The hallways were dimly lit and the carpet was old with lots of suspicious-looking stains (puke puddles is my guess). One day the cleaning crew had a box of \"Urine Off\" in the hallway - nice! There were yellow stains on the wall in our bathroom - we didn't want to know. The shower/tub combo has old sliding doors that didn't work too well, and the old showerhead sprayed all over as well. And I think I saw some mold in the caulking, luckily I am pretty blind without contacts and I decided not to check once they were in. The one plus was the room was large so having a rollaway bed was not a problem. I slept on it and it wasn't too bad, just squeaky for my cousins to hear every time I rolled around! The first night it was a little hard to get used to the \"boom\" sound of the compressed air from the Bellagio fountains across the street. I don't think they run the fountains all night long, or maybe I just got used to them. The wallpaper is peeling, the dresser was old, as was the TV, but overall we agreed it could have been worse, and we weren't hanging out in the room a whole lot. But for $170/night on the weekend, it could have been better. I wish we wouldn't have been so cheap and upgraded for the $20/night more they offered.

The hotel was right in the middle of The Strip. I stayed in the North Tower, which was recently renovated ($20/day surcharge). As with all Vegas hotels, one had to walk through the casino to get anywhere and every public area was smoke filled. But my non-smoking room had no trace of smoke. The grounds and lobby did not have any interesting displays like many of the newer hotels. It was connected to Paris via an indoor \u201cstreets\u201d that emulated France. It was also connected to the monorail station via an indoor mall. There was a workout area that cost $22/day, which was so outrageous that I did not use the facilities. There were several overpriced but decent restaurants onsite and the indoor mall had a couple of inexpensive places to eat (Sbarro Italian, Nathan\u2019s deli, sushi). The room was quite large and quiet, except minor outside Vegas noise. D\u00e9cor was pleasant. Everything, including carpet, was clean. Bed was comfortable enough. Bathroom had granite countertop and tiled shower. The toilet sounded like a freight train though. There was an old TV, a small laptop-size safe, no coffee or refrigerator. Internet access was wireless, not blazing speed but serviceable, and cost $13.99 a day ($24/day if you want to use it in other areas of the hotel). Summary If you want to stay on The Strip, this hotel is in a good location with nice size, quiet, reasonably priced rooms and good access to the monorail. Overall, it\u2019s not bad but nothing spectacular. Be aware of the potential extra charges ($14/day for internet, $22/day for workout, $20/day for refurbished rooms).

I asked what would that mean because I had nothing to compare it to since this was our first time here. He said it would be $20 and that we would have a view of the strip. I thought that would be nice so agreed. Went up to our room and it did have a view of the strip....I mean, I could see other hotel lights & signs and cars but the actual room was no better than a standard Queen room in any Best Western or the like....some of them we've been in have been better! Someone had also put their fist through the wall beside the bed. yikes! Silly me, when I checked out, we had been charged the $20 each of the 4 nights we were there. That never occurred to me since I had heard other Vegas goers say that they'd slip the desk clerk a 20 and get a really nice room...that's what I expected too. Just didn't expect it to be a daily thing. I won't fall for that again! I must say, the beds are sooooo comfortable and the pillows just perfect. Room service was very prompt and the delivery people very friendly. We had supper at Ballys Steakhouse and our waiter, John was so accommodating and patient. We just wanted to chill and chat over appetizers and wine to start and he left us alone but seemed to know when we were ready for our entree and was attentive without rushing us. The very best thing about Ballys is how central it is. You can walk to Paris and not even go outside....though I thought we were at first!! The monorail is right there and so are buses that will drop you right at the door of other hotels/casinos. Good little Tequila restaurant there too and they are the friendliest people ever and just make you feel like you are a regular there! In fact, I think that's their motto!! I guess I could say that because it was in Vegas, we never spent much time in our room...only to sleep but that's not the point.

Our room was HUGE, but the North Tower rooms don't have a nice view, except at night. The rooms do not face the strip/Bellagio. But the staff was excellent, including housekeeping. Even the gambling was great. The only complaint I have is they charge you $3/day to use the safe, which I think is ridiculous. We could have gambled that money instead! The beds were very comfortable, but the tv channels were very limited. I guess they don't want you in the room. We rented a car and used the valet daily. They were fast and courteous.

Check in was okay, but we had a buffet package, and we had to ask how the package worked, and then it was not explained to us correctly. We had problems when we went to a few of the restaurants. It all was sorted out but front desk staff should have known better.

Of course there is a very good reason for this.....they do not want you in the room. They want you downstairs gambling....Ugh! I am not a gambler, and was there on business. Everything in Vegas is outrageously expensive. Everything. An iced vanilla latte $8.00. Any burger from just about anywhere $13.00 minimum. Breakfast in the cafe was $18.00. A bowl of oatmeal $5.99. I think everything in Vegas needs to be 50% less. I do recommend the little liquor store across the street on the North side of the hotel. A liter bottle of water $0.79 cents. It's a little sundry store with lots of different snack foods, toiletries, a decent wine selection, great prices, and open 24 hours. The casino is easy to navigate, but way too smoky compared to other casinos. Very tight slots, and expensive tables. I'm not a big gambler, so maybe I'm a little critical here. The Spa is very nice though. They have nice cardio equipment and a very nice weight room. The connection to the Paris is nice. Overall, it was an okay place to stay. I would look to other newer strip hotels before I would pick Bally's again. The one positive is the location as it is central to many other casinos one might want to visit.

A person has to enjoy walking, because the place is huge. It's easy to be disoriented at first, but I quickly learned to navigate. Staff is helpful and friendly, which is saying a lot for a busy place like this.

But that was ten years ago. Now, this hotel ranks as one of the WORST based on my recent stay. Check out my break down below. Hotel Property: Hotel property is pretty average, nothing special or unique. If anything, it actually looks outdated compared the the other hotels on the strip. As you walk into the hotel the smell of cigarette and cigar smoke overwhelms you. But, that's normal for a lot hotels in Vegas. Bally's is connected to the Paris hotel with a small row of shops and restaurants. Pool area is big but that's all its got going for it. Looks like it's straight out of the 70's, all the pool furniture is old and crusty. Don't expect quality service at the pool area either. Hotel has a gym but you must pay $22 per day to use it. Nobody wants to work out that bad, c'mon. Room: I was told when I checked in that I was receiving an upgraded room because they did not have a single king size bed that I requested when I reserved the room. Of course, I was excited and agreed to except the upgrade instead of taking a room with two queen size beds. But when I stepped into my room, oh how I was upset. I was in what use to be the living room area of an old suite. This room looked like no one had stayed here since the 70's. All the furniture was sooo outdated and dirty. My bed was a \"fold-out\" bed out of the wall!!! I of course called the front desk and they told me that there were no rooms left and that I could not change rooms until the next day. Riiight... So in short, be careful of the so called upgrade at Bally's. You will probably get a bigger room, but it just be a bigger dump. Casino: The casino was average. Nothing special, mostly old slot machines and no one at the tables. Cigarette and cigar smoke is pretty bad there because they do nothing to try and mask the smell like most new casinos do now. They must have bad ventilation in there or something because you will feel dirty just from the walk from the front door to the elevators. Customer Service: I arrived at the Bally's in the afternoon and the lady at the front desk was sooo unpleasant. She seriously looked like she would rather be eating glass than work there. She had a big frown on here face and was very short with me. There was no hello, have a nice day, or anything. It was pretty depressing. My toilet was broken when I got to my room and it was making this screeching loud noise. It was so loud that even with both doors closed you could hear it from two doors down in the hall. But the worst part is, I had to complain about it for two days before anyone would fix it. I had to personally search out a maintenance person to come to my room and fix it. This took a total of 5 phone calls to maintenance and the front desk before I finally had to just search for someone myself. Took him about an hour to replace parts in the toilet and then he said that I could have fixed it myself. I couldn't believe it! Conclusion: All in all, I would say that the Bally's has long surpassed it's prime. It seems like it's falling apart in all areas. I have seen little effort to keep the hotel rooms and property updated. Unfortunately the staff is not what it use to be either. Nobody cares about their jobs or the customer. I really wish I could have given Bally's a good review because I had so many good memories here, but this stay was just the worst i've had in Vegas.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "western ny", "Title": "\u201cA real nice stay\u201d", "Author": "johnamg", "ReviewID": "UR119279065", "Content": "We stayed at Bally's from 10/8 to 10/12 for a convention.

The standard king room was extremely large and accomodated two desks, loveseat and coffee table along with the standard hotel room furniture. The bathroom was large, with good lighting, ample vanity space and towels were abundant.

I approached the woman at guest services the next day, (Kathy I believe) and explained our disappointment with the offering. She was very understanding and offered us a choice of two different rooms.

It was still dated and in need of some repair, but a big step up from the first room. The room we passed on in the north tower had been more recently renovated and had a very nice bathroom, but I didn't like the view of the roof and airport.

The room did have a coffee maker which i did not use. The only thing that I did not like was the shower because although it did have good pressure a lot of water fell onto the bathroom floor. I loved that Ballys and Paris are connected because during the summer its very hot outside and i get sunburned easily so walking through the air conditioned casinos make it much better. The sports book was hard to find at first but we figured out it was downstairs and u can take the guest elevators to go there. We ate at the tequila bar... theyre open til 6 am and its a good place to go if ur looking for cheap food and drinks... they have $2 tequila shots, margaritas, tacos, or draft beer. We didnt have to wait for a table which was great. we also checked in on facebook and received a buy one get one free drink at any casino bar and we found a casino bar that had $3 draft blue moon and we were able to use the coupon there which was awesome! When we were checking out we didnt have to wait in line and the check out person checked to see if we had any comp dollars on our accounts which no one had ever done before so i appreciated that very much! all in all i would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone because of the central location and because of the awesome rooms! =)", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location yet inconvenient neccessities\u201d", "Author": "luckynutmeg", "ReviewID": "UR119001939", "Content": "I stayed at Bally's for a business trip for three nights.

RESERVATIONS: Fairly easy, though they do charge the first night to your credit card BEFORE you stay and also have a 72 hour cancellation policy. CHECK-IN: Fast, friendly and efficient. I was in and out within 5 minutes. ROOMS: I chose the North Tower based on TA reviews and after talking to the reservationist. However, I must admit...I wasn't all that impressed. The room was a good size and had a nice sized bathroom. However, the carpet was FILTHY! It looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the beginning of time. (I wore socks while in the room and they were dark from dirt after a couple of hours.) The beds were quite firm, so I used my trusty mattress pad which made it a comfortable night's sleep. The room was VERY quiet and I only heard a door shut once. It was hot in Vegas, so I kept the air conditioner on all night. Thankfully, the conditioner was very quiet and didn't keep me awake. The toilet ran all night long, so I had to keep the bathroom door shut. The t.v. is the old \"tube\" kind and had terrible reception. There was a refrigerator, iron, blow dryer, etc. No microwave. The bathroom soaps and shampoos were Gilchrist and Soames which are my favorite. There were 2 writing desks. (I'm not sure why because one would have been enough) and an ample closet. There was a ridiculous charge for the internet...which I think is unbelievable since most hotels don't charge for internet these days. (I'm sure Bally's can afford free internet based on all the people I saw gambling and losing!!) FACILITIES: This is where Bally's falls short! The trek from self-parking is quite a long one, so if you decide to bring your luggage from the parking garage...good luck! Most of Bally's restaurants and all of their shopping is in the \"basement.\" I wanted a caramel apple (that cost me $12) and had to walk a ways to get it. The pool is REALLY a long walk and quite crowded. The Monorail is also in the basement and VERY inconvenient. (Note to anyone wanting to travel around Las Vegas...TAKE A CAB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) RESTAURANTS: We ate at the Sidewalk Cafe for breakfast and my husband talked me into getting their breakfast buffet. I'm not into buffets, but we had eaten at the Paris buffet and were blown away by the exceptional food and low cost. ($15.99 per person.) The Sidewalk buffet was $10.99, but didn't include oj ($2.00 per glass) like they dad at the Paris. Though the service at the Sidewalk was MUCH better than at the Paris, the quality and selection of food was subpar. So, I would suggest walking a few extra \"steps\" and eating at the Paris Buffet for a couple more dollars. You won't be disappointed. CHECK-OUT: I used the express check-out and it was very convenient. OVERALL: If the North Tower is the \"nice\" section, I shudder to think what the South Tower is like. But, I'd rather pay less to stay at Bally's than to shell out $200-$300 a night at the Paris. I bring my own Lysol wipes, so I gave the room a good scrub.

Our room was comped and upgraded to the North Tower and while we didn't have the best view ( along the back section looking at back of Flamingo) it was large, clean, modern and had a coffee maker. Since we arrived early from the East coast and checked in at 10:15am a room ready and waiting was a nice surprise. Check in was quick. We have platinum cards so there is a separate line, but regular check in line was short and moving quickly also. The receptionist was very friendly and searched and searched for a room that was ready. The beds were very comfortable although I must say Ballys in Atlantic City has much better pillows. The room was quiet with plenty of towels for two. Rather then pay for a frig, we take along a soft sided cooler (flattens to fit in suitcase) and some zip lock bags to fill with ice. Works great to keep left overs, drinks or snacks cold. The casino floor is laid out quite nice. Lots of choices to play and if you get bored here Paris is connected or being in the center of the strip you can head in what ever direction you want to find some action! There was a band playing in the evening by the Tequila Bar and they were quite good. We did the Jubilee show last time here and it was fabulous! A true Vegas production! We ate at the breakfast buffet one morning and it was just ok. Scrambled eggs kind of warm and bacon not real crispy. The fresh fruit was delicious. The servers now bring you toast or a bagel if you want. It was not up on the buffet. We ordered off the menu the second day and it was very good. I'm not a hash brown fan, but there's were delicious and bacon was cooked perfectly! The service was excellant and again there was a separate line for platinum, so no waiting. We ate at the Tequila Bar one evening for a quick bite and it was very good and reasonable. Excellent Chile and pulled pork sandwich and you can't go wrong with a $2 Margarita!!!! Service was quick and friendly. Nosh over by the escalators also has fantastic sandwiches. The bread they use is so fresh and delicious. Great place to grab a sandwich or hot dog. The pool is beautiful and during the week it is pretty easy to get a lounge chair. Drinks there are quite expensive and you cannot bring in your own. It is also a pretty good walk to get to especially if you are in the south tower. We had purchased buy one get one free monorail tickets off of the monorails facebook page. Usually $12 per person, so we got 2 for $12. We hadn't ridden it yet so thought this was a good opportunity for the price. The platform is a hike like the pool, but it was nice to check out some of the other casinos. It was not heavily used and during the day it was fine, but I don't know that I would want to have to use it at night. The platforms can be quite desolate with no security that we saw, but there may some at night. We had originally booked the Flamingo for this trip, but after reading review after bad review we decided to switch back to Ballys and I'm glad we did.

It's close to Bill's, the Stage Door, and Ellis Island, which in my opinion, are \"must do's\" in Vegas. We stayed four nights in the south tower.

The only downside I can think of is that the parking garage is a long way away from the south tower, but in Vegas, what hotel's garage isn't a long way away?

That's all you could see and there were spotlights down below that pointed upwards right outside our window. We went back to the desk and said we did not want the upgrade with that kind of view so we were downgraded to the tower where the rooms have not been renovated. The view from this room was awesome. We looked out on the Eiffel Tower and the pool at the Paris resort. We could also see the water and light show at the Bellagio. The only difference in the room is that the other one was more modern, newer furniture, flat screen t.v., new carpet. This room was fine for us, we didn't care how outdated the furniture was, the room was spotless. We didn't spend very much time in the room anyway except to sleep and shower. The bathroom was always clean and lots of towels, etc. The staff at the hotel was great. The bartender that works the graveyard shift, Brett, always made us ceasars in the morning. We went for early morning coffee to Sbarro, a pizza, etc. place, that is downstairs. There are a bunch of shops down there also, pretty decent prices. We went to the restaurant upstairs for breakfast every morning. The staff was always friendly and cheerful. Good food, large portions and fast service. The hotel is in a perfect location, everything is in within waliking distance. My mother was with us and she needed a wheelchair. We were able to rent one from the hotel for a reasonable cost. There were elevators or ramps pretty much everywhere, very accessible. There is a small bar/restaurant called the Tequila Bar that had nachos, quesadillas, a really good cheese dip and fries with some kind of spice that was very good. We ate there twice and it was very good. Check out was easy, you just do it through the t.v. and leave the keys.

There was a flat screen TV, but I don't think we even turned it on the whole time we were there. The lobby was clean, check in was a breeze and there was access to several restaurants right from the casino floor. A quick jaunt through the tunnel next door to the Paris expands on the dining selection. Access to the strip is via the moving walkway, which was under repair for part of our stay, so we had to walk a ways, but that's to be expected anywhere in Vegas. There is a sandwich shop right beside the elevators for the South Tower that makes one of the best turkey clubs I have ever eaten. There's a coffee shop in the lobby that gets pretty busy in the mornings, but gets the job done. The only criticism I have of Bally's is that service on the casino floor leaves a little to be desired. I played craps for about 45 minutes and not once did a waitress come by. I ended up spending most of my time at other casinos. I highly recommend signing up for the free Total Rewards program for anyone staying here, or any Caeser's property, even if you barely gamble.

We had other family coming in around midnight so we asked if they could put us all on the same floor and she did and she also said she would check them all in and they just had to come get their keys when they got there. 2 of the rooms were comped and one room only cost us $23 a day. This was a great deal. Our room was VERY nice. It was big and clean. It had a table and chairs to go with it and then another comfortable chair. We were very pleased. I liked their shampoo/conditioner and wrote a note asking for extra and they left about 10. I thought that was very nice. We used the pool every day. We went early since we were on east coast time. The pool is very big and they have many chairs. The only bad thing is that you have to walk through a little mall downstairs. It is much closer when you stay in the north tower. The walk isn't as bad as I thought it would be. There are cheap eating places here and you can get coupons on line for them. We ate at Nathan's twice. Their food is pretty good. We also like that Bally's and Paris are connected so there are many eating places between them. We ate one lunch at the Sidewalk cafe in Bally's and the food was OK but the service was SLOW. We also ate at Nosh(it's right by the South tower) and that was pretty good too. We only stayed here 2 nights. The rest of the family stayed for 5 nights. We had reservations at Caesar's. We hadn't stayed there before and we got a pretty good rate so we wanted to try it. The room at Caesar's was wonderful but I did like the vibe at Bally's much better. The day that we checked out I noticed that I couldn't find my glasses. I only use them for distance so I only wear them to shows or to drive. I asked at Bally's thinking maybe I had left them in the room. I was hoping I hadn't left them at a slot machine. They told me to check lost and found and sure enough the maids had found them and taken them to lost and found. I was so excited and so glad that I had left a tip in the room. Everyone at Bally's was so nice(much nicer than at Caesars). Bally's has a great location and their rooms were very nice. They aren't the Wynn but for the price they are a great value.

I have to say Tequilla bar and grill have fantastic nacho's and 2 dollar margaritas the only other place that has wonderful margaritas was at the fremont hotel on fremont street has them at the sports bar for 99 cents. we also ate at the fremont hotel at tony roma's and had ribs that were to die for. You also can get a pitcher of beer for 8 dollars. we did a few shows Le Reve worth every penny at the Wynn, we did Legends very good impersonators at the Harrahs, and we did Menopause the musical that made you laugh so hard this was at luxor. 3 of the girls had never been to las vegas and so they did the bus tour to vegas it was a long day but did enjoy seeing hoverdam, the grand canyon. this tour was about 10 hours from pick up to drop off, a few years ago I did the helicopter tour and seen all this in about 4 hours.

I read quite a few reviews online and was looking forward to try the \u201c20 dollar trick\u201d (if you don\u2019t know what this is, search online and you will find lots of postings). We checked in at around 1pm on a Monday, we waited in line for just a minute and it was very smooth. The staff member that checked us in was very nice and I\u2019m not going to mention her name for privacy reasons. When handing in my ID, TR card and credit card, I had a folded $50 bill in between, she saw and said: \u201coh is this for me?\u201d, I said yes, she put it in her pocket and I said: \u201cwe were wondering if you guys are not too busy if it would be possible to get an upgrade\u201d, she said that she would see what she could do and with a smile on her face started typing away.....she was able to upgrade us to a Junior suite in the North Tower (which is the upgraded/renovated one); the room was huge and very nice as you can see from the pictures. A few minutes after getting in to the tower, the check-in staff member called us in the room to ask if everything was ok, if we liked the room.....that was awesome! We had read reviews and some people were saying to use $20 for a 3 night stay, $50 for 4 nights or more and $100 for 7 days or more.....so we tipped her $50 and it worked out great, after all our room was originally comped, so a Junior suite for 5 nights for $50 was a pretty sweet deal! Bally\u2019s doesn\u2019t have a buffet but there are a few food options by the casino or towards the sports book, or you can walk to Paris which is right next door and they are internally connected. There are other options close by as well as Bally\u2019s is very well located on the strip and even a few options very close by a little off strip. The casino floor has been renovated and it looked much nicer since the last we were there, one of their casino bars have Guinness on tap which you don\u2019t see very much in Vegas, so you can play video poker while enjoying a Guinness! The 2 bartenders we interacted with were very nice, professional and friendly and even surprised us with water bottles in between drinks before we had to ask, a very nice touch. The sports book is a couple minutes away, on the lower floor on the way to the pool area, it is tight and a little dated. There had a small pool with heated water and a very large one with room temperature water while we were there in May; the pool area is large and had lots of chairs and also cabanas for rent. There were also a couple of options for drinks and food. We had read a few good reviews for the Tequila Bar & Grill, which is right by the casino, but it wasn\u2019t as nice as we thought it was going to be, just ok...one night we were seated but waited for service for 15 minutes, so we left. They had a stage with a lounge area also right next to the casino and every night they had a band playing and there was one particular one that was awesome, I wish I knew their name. They had no sign and Bally\u2019s didn\u2019t seem to advertise that particular entertainment area much, at least we didn\u2019t see anything and heard the band one night while walking by. We had seen Jubilee before in 2008 but we didn\u2019t like it, it was boring and thankfully they had some pretty good entertainers perform in between the Jubilee dance acts. We had won tickets, which was a good thing otherwise it would have been also a waste of money for us as we felt that it was a waste of time, we actually left before the end. The cleaning staff kept our room spotless and they were very nice as well, overall every staff member we came in contact with was very friendly. The floor we were in had a very large sitting area next to the elevators, I have never seen such a large one like this before, it was huge with couches and chairs. One day we went down a few floors and it also looked the same, very nice! We were very happy with our stay at Bally\u2019s, had a great experience and would definitely stay there again; we felt that comped or not Bally\u2019s is worth the money! They don\u2019t seem to get as much credit as they deserve, we all know that Vegas has been pretty hurt with the economy still recovering, and we thought that Bally\u2019s treated us extremely well. We are not high rollers and like to treat staff as people (and not as servants like others), a friendly approach and a tip, which doesn\u2019t have to be a lot, will definitely get you a long way and Bally\u2019s has proven this to us, after all it is one of the motivations for the ones who work in the service industry.

There was a safe in the room that was free for Diamond & 7-Star players, along with a coffee pot. You can also request a refrigerator. The pool is a nice size with a siting ledge along the side of the pool--great for sitting and sipping a cocktail. If you sit near the bar area, be aware that around noon the DJ starts spinning records and there are HUGE speakers next to a few of the chairs. This is also the area with constant shade. Tequila Bar-- stopped in for lunch to go. Hint- you need to go to the bar to order \"to-go\" orders. I had to talk to three employees for this information. As I was waiting for my Taco Salad (approx $12.00) the gentlemen next to me had the $2.00 taco, which is not on the menu--you just have to ask. The taco was like the crunchy tacos at Taco Bell--lots of lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. I suggest forgetting the Taco Salad and order to of the $2.00 tacos.

I simply went for early morning runs on the Strip, and used the pool (which was excellent) for free. My only complaint was with some of the service. My wife has medication which needs a fridge. When we booked the room, we specifically asked and were promised that we'd get a room with a fridge. We check in and there's no fridge. We call the front desk and they say that all the room fridges are in use, and they'd put us on a waiting list. We explain that this isn't to keep the beer cold, and that we really NEED a fridge. So they offered to move us to another room. We then were waiting for over an hour watching TV, not exactly what I planned to do in Vegas. So I went downstairs and got the room key for the second room myself. I suggested that it might be appropriate to get some sort of comp, discount, etc., and they said no. When we checked out at the end of our holiday, they asked how we enjoyed everything and we mentioned this incident. The clerk spoke with a manager who agreed to waive our safety deposit box and phone charges (about $25). That was fine with us.

My only minor complaint was that we had asked for a non smoking room and it did have the odor of smoke. It was not intolerable however. The casino itself is smaller than the Bellagio or Planet Hollywood and does get very crowded. This makes it impossible to get a cocktail unless you leave your machine and go to the bar. Also, on Friday and Saturday nights Bally's has 2 or 3 female dancers around casino for your viewing pleasure. Most people are gambling and not even paying attention. I think if they are going to waste the money on this they should at least give women some \"eye candy\" too. Put a few men up there dancing in a speedo. There are alot of women in Vegas these days too. Bally's Steakhouse is excellent. (You can get 50% off coupons at Half Price Tix for Tonight). Price is Right is an incredible show as well.

One thing about the property is that it is so immense, you are going to walk for a long way just to get to the Strip. Thankfully, they recognized the distance and put in people-movers. Except for the night they were inoperable, they were greatly appreciated. I did love the fact that Bally's and Paris are connected through an inside shopping corridor.

Been before and had the same experience this time, actually, this trip was even better because of the friendly staff. Purpose of my trip was to relax with a few books at the pool during a brief get-a-way. I was frustrated at my airline arriving over an hour late, which timed it so that we had 2 jumbo planes unloading thru Customs in front of us \u2013 took an hour and a half to get thru Customs and that was a first for me (I\u2019ve been to Vegas on vacation about 20 times and never waited more than 10 minutes at Customs in the past). Got to the hotel around 830pm and was lucky to have only a few people in front of me to check in \u2026 this hotel is known for long check in lines. The employee who checked me in was very nice, I simply said hi and asked how his day went, and then asked what it would cost to upgrade my room to a North Tower room. He said $20 per night and I said okay, let\u2019s do it. A few minutes later, the employee said he gave it to me for free at no extra charge. I thanked him and then generously tipped him. He thanked me for the tip, and tried then to upgrade me to a suite, but I declined as I was traveling alone suggested he keep the suite for a couple who might check in later. He asked what else he could do for me \u2013 I said how about a late check out and he confirmed me a 3pm check out at no fee. That was the highlight as many times when you can get a late check out, they don\u2019t confirm it until morning of check out and then even with a fee it\u2019s only until about 1pm most of the time. I was also able to get a quiet, non-smoking room as requested. I ended up with a decent view up on the 20th floor overlooking part of the roof and also the pool. The room was decent, clean, larger than most Vegas hotels. I have never stayed in the the Classic rooms (ones without a reno) so cannot compare, but the North Tower rooms suit me fine. Spent 3 days at the pool. I never had a problem finding a lounge chair, but really, due to the heat, most people are in the pool and not lounging outside the pool. Like any other Vegas hotel, drinks are a rip off at the pool but since you cannot bring in outside food and beverages, you don\u2019t have a choice but to pay those prices. The food at the Blu Caf\u00e9 at the pool was good and reasonably priced for Vegas. FYI: On Fridays thru Sundays, the DJ at the pool cranks up music at 1230pm to an ungodly volume so be prepared. I don\u2019t gamble so cannot comment on that aspect. I dined a few times at the Paris Hotel buffet, but made a point to hit the Wynn\u2019s buffet \u2013 totally worth the extra money eating there as there is a delightful selection and the quality of their food surpasses anywhere else I\u2019ve eaten on the strip. Some others I know say the Bellagio buffet is the best, but being from Vancouver I\u2019m not eager to eat seafood in Vegas when it\u2019s readily available fresh at home, and that seems to be the bragging rights at the Bellagio buffet \u2013 their seafood. Don\u2019t buy bottled water in any of the hotels on the strip \u2013 that\u2019s just wasting your money. Bottled water is cheaper in the ABC Store in the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood OR also at the corner store behind Bally\u2019s \u2013 if you exit Bally\u2019s by the Sports Betting area, that immediate cross street has a bar on the corner (sign says 19 years left on our lease) and also is attached to a corner store. If you\u2019d like to walk further, there is a Walgreens done across from Monte Carlo as well as a CVS Pharmacy too and those places sell bottled water and other items at decent prices.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt's Time To Up-Date\u201d", "Author": "Prine041745", "ReviewID": "UR116391226", "Content": "We have been staying at Bally's off and on for years.

We had some drinks in the tequila bar which were nice and good value for money. We also ate in the cafe/diner place near the pool (breakfast) which was nice.

Ya okay i'm sure they're not scrubbing the tiles or the ceilings everyday... but whatever, i paid like 750$ for Air AND hotel, for 4days.. for two people, like i care .. bed sheets smelled like bleach so that was a great sign!!! Hotel has krispy creams and coffee for cheap.... make sure you sign up for their card and you get points. There is also a tunnel from the casino into Paris!!!! that's so awesome!!!

I ran into a problem though - in the age of technology, I have 2 cell phones and a laptop. There were NOT enough outlets in the room - not even a strip of outlets at the desk. I had to unplug the lapms... I called my Husband to tell him to bring a power strip when he came - because he will add 2 cell phones to the mix as well! My co-workers who attended the seminar with me complained of the same thing. Meals and snacks during the class were catered by the hotel and were \"fine\" but nothing to be excited about. I ate at a couple of the \"food court\" establishments (Nathan's, Sbarros, etc.) and those were good. I was disappointed that the Buffet was gone (\"The Kitchen\" or something like that..). We ate there during our last trip to Vegas in 2007 and it was GREAT! I was really looking forward to eating there again.

I did not go to the shows. This time we were put in the north tower. Clean room. No coffeemaker, clean bedding, No phone in the bathroom. Granite bathroom countertops. Clean toilets. Carpet worn and stained. Furniture dated but not worn or broken. Nice fluffy pillows. Air conditioning is great. Walls showed worn area around air intake duct. Closet big and more than adequate to set two suitcases into it. Tub has granite walls. Lots of towels and face cloths. Ironing board and iron are full sized and work well. TV flat screen 25 inch in cabinet. Internet charge it is not free. Desk in room. Two phones. Two bedside tables. Lounge chair. Elevators still working well. Staff was very nice but make beds at 8 AM on weekdays or try to do so. Nothing to put on the door to stop the staff from knocking on the door. Food is put on tables for service not as in some hotels with just a tray. Food is reasonably priced but with Total Rewards it was free. Gambling is not paying out there since the economy is pretty weak. Casino has not changed. Tequila Bar had 2.00 Margaritas and 2.00 Tacos. Creme Brulee is fantastic.Lots of table games, slots, as usual. Easy access to back for elevators and restrooms in casino. Fast check in and out. We have Diamond status so we go to Daimond Club to check in. If you are Gold member get ready to stand in a long line. Platinum members not bad only a few people there in line. Seven Star members must get royal treatment. We had a standard room. New bridge over Ballys to go to Bills and Flamingo next to each other. Escalators and electric walkways out to the front of LV Blvd. for impaired. Easy (fastest) way is to go across street on Flamingo at Bills and go up to LV Blvd and Flamingo if walking. Side entrance is my favorite. I had a car. Park in back and go thru mall area to elevators at mall level to room. Mall is downstairs from casino and escalators lead to tram/monorail. Lots of mall shops and eaterys with pizza and hot dogs and a pool at back. Overall about the same as most visits to Ballys. We did not use the pool. Another 4 star visit. I knocked off for the worn down carpet. You can check out over the phone or at the desk, or on TV. We tried the phone route and found out today that part of the food bill was not put on the account since it was charged on the day we left. This was quickly resolved with a call to Ballys billing department. But if you do not gamble or play with your players card, you have to pay for it. There are coke machines on every floor but it was empty and could be they want you to buy it from room service. Its 2.50 in machine and 4.00 in the hotel. There is a 7-11 behind Ballys and a convenience store at the side on Flamingo as well. Prices much cheaper outside the hotel for bottled water as well...3.50 a pop in the hotel. They raised prices and changed the menus out while we were there. I think prices go up often. Nosh is a deli that has DELICIOUS pastrami sandwiches, soups, and parfees as well as baked items. Also has a coffee bar near check in with desserts. Wine list in room. Cable TV. Movies. Video games for the kids for a price on TV. Adult movies....etc. Wheelchair rooms.

The pool was not spectacular but the DJ there was very good. Compared to the other hotels in Vegas, the casino and theme were pretty boring but the rooms are apparently much bigger.

There is a pizzeria located in the walkway between Bally's and Paris that has yummy pizza. The Tequila Bar at Bally's has good food at reasonable prices.

Just a place to sleep. We arrived fairly late and were still met with a line @ check in. Seemed to always be one. We had the *RUDEST* guy, ironically named Elvis, check us in. After calling us over, he rudley looked at his screen, pecked on the computer in cyber speed. We tried to make small talk and he wouldn't even look at us. I asked if there were any upgrades available and he said \"No way\". Um, okay then. Turns out they were sold out of the rooms we had booked and we were upgraded to a suite for the night. Only it was made abundantly clear this was for one night only and we would have to change to our regular rooms the next night. The size of the suite (1700 square feet) and the view of the strip/pool were quite impressive. The decor was hideous and hadn't been redone in about 20 years. The suite was filthy dirty. Dust everywhere. There was a jacuzzi tub in the room that I had to clean before we would even step foot in it. The maid hadn't cleaned the very visable ring around the tub off. Ewww. I didn't expect to have to spend our first night cleaning that, but what are you going to do? Thank goodness I travel with a small can of Lysol. We went down to \"guest services\" the next day. What a joke. Had one clerk waiting on the whole line of people. Stood in line for 30 minutes at least to change rooms for the mistake that THEY made by overbooking. How's that for customer service?? I asked what it would be to stay in the big room, was told an additional $150 a night. She tried to tell us that normally, that suite went for $800 a night. Ha! If I paid that much for that dump, I would be furious!! We didn't pay $800 for our whole trip (airfare included). We decided to save our money and move to a regular room. She sent a bellman up. He was a very nice elderly man, but don't let his age fool you. That guy threw our bags on and practially ran through that hotel. After that marathon, we arrived in our regular room. It was in the back tower. It was much cleaner, decor was updated. The view of the parking garage sucked, but you get what you pay for I guess. Our A/C was working very well, kept the room cool. Bed was comfortable. Housekeeping came every day and did a good job cleaning up. No complaints after that. Check out was easy. I would stay here again if I had to.

Upon arrival we were offered to \"upgrade\" our room for an extra $20.00. I did not realize, nor did the travel website mention there were 2 types of rooms, a \"classic room\" and a \"upgraded\" room. I declined to spend the extra money thinking how bad can the rooms be at a major casino/hotel in Vegas. Upon arriving in the room, the first thing I noticed was the old worn out furniture, old bedding and tube TV from the early 1990's. I went to get some ice from the machine down the hall and when I picked up the ice bucket it was half full of old water, which indicates poor housekeeping. The TV worked half the time, losing signal on and off. The first morning I was there, housekeeping knocked 2 times, announced themselves, and entered the room, all within a matter of 5 seconds, this was at 8:30 am. The closing of the door woke me up. There was no fridge, coffee, or even a pen and paper in the room!! I visit Vegas several times a year on business and pleasure. Ive stayed in both luxury and mid-range hotels. The bottom line is for the money I spent the room was a total ripoff. The room is straight out of the early 90's with the old TV, worn bedding, and old furniture. It is indeed \"classic\", but the price is straight out of the year 2011. For the price you pay you can find a much nicer room on or off the strip. Upon checking out I mentioned the issues to the front desk manager? She appeared attentive by writing down the issues with the room, but really could have cared less. Her response was \" The rumor is these rooms are going to be updated\". Im never coming back to find out. Ballys is a big name in Vegas, the outward appearance of the casino/hotel looks very nice, but theres a racket going on with them renting out old, outdated rooms. My advice is to shop around and spend your money elsewhere. If you are just wanting a clean room at a decent price for a pleasure trip stay at Bills across the street.

The bed was comfortable, bathroom was big, and the best of all was we had a coffee pot (which we were excited about since hearing most of the rooms don't). We went to Ballys pool to lay out everyday. The pool is big and the perfect temp. We never had a problem finding a place to lay. My only complaint is that the waitresses by the pool are SO rude. It's hard to find them some of the time and then you feel like they hate you when you ask for a drink. They are not friendly and I don't think I ever saw one of them smile! We also would have liked the music to be a bit louder, it was pretty low. The tequilla bar had awesome $2 tacos, draft beers, frozen margs, and shots of tequilla. The margs. were too sweet for me so I just ordered another $2 shot and it was better. They also have a Sabarro on your way to the pool that is open 24hrs, it was good also. We never tried any other resturants in the casino. The casino smoke did not bother us, and we are not smokers. It was pretty easy to put a few dollars in the machine and get a free beer or cocktail! The one thing we didn't know until the last day is that you can use the Paris' pool since they are connected. I would def. recommend that pool over Ballys! It's way cleaner, had good music, and a half off happy hour around 4:00 I think. The location of Bally's is awesome!! It's centrally located so you can go either way down the strip.

We checked in on Saturday June 11, 2011 around 7pm. There was almost no wait to check in which was great! We quickly dropped our bags in the room and headed out for dinner. It was late when we got back to the room and we went straight to bed. In the morning, when we were settling in, my fiance found a womens hairclip in the nightstand drawer. Strange but easy to overlook I suppose. But things quickly went downhill. I went to shower and get ready for the day. As I'm standing in the shower, I look over to see that there was a used bar of soap left from the last guest as well as a dirty washcloth hanging over the curtain rod. GROSS. I was able to get past the hairclip but someone else's soap and washcloth was too much for me! I spoke with a manager who apologized and offered us a new room, which of course we accepted. The new room turned out to be an upgrade to a suite, which was beautiful but most importantly clean! The pictures attached are from the suite. There was a great jacuzzi bathtub that is located in the living room, but unfortunately it wasn't quite big enough for my fiance and I to sit and soak together. We are not large people by any means but were unable to sit side by side. Also, this suite had an amazing view of the strip, but the tub faced away from the windows. So sitting in the tub soaking left you facing the bathroom walls instead of the lights of the strip. Not great planning if you ask me. We did not feel like Bally's provided the same level of customer service or care that the other Harrahs(now Caesars Entertainment) properties provide. There was a sign on the safe stating that your room would be charged $3/day that the safe was used. Seriously? We carry alot of cash with us to Vegas and always secure it in the safe. I know $3 per day isn't a large fee, but for me it was the principle of the matter. I really felt like the hotel was just nickel and diming us. Also, I realized that I had somehow managed to lose my toothbrush, but when I called and asked housekeeping for a new toothbrush they informed me that they don't have any and that I should check the gift shop. I was shocked! I have forgotten many things on vacations and never has a hotel not been able to replace them, everything from toothbrushes, to razors, even contact solution! I ended up buying one in the gift shop ($1.79). There certainly were some positives to our stay however! We purchased the all-access stage pass which allows you to see as many shows at the Harrahs properties as you can in 48 hours. We managed to see 5 shows in 2 days. We saw Legends in Concert at Harrahs, great show! Then we saw Jubilee at Ballys, wow, this is a must see, absolutely amazing! The next day we saw The Price is Right at Ballys and my fiance was a big winner. He got to \"come on down\" and won an expresso maker, an elliptical, a lawnmower, a chaise lounge, and a slot machine! (They are shipping them all to us for free). That night we saw Vinnie Favorito and George Wallace at Flamingo. Vinnie is hilarious and I can't wait to see his show again. Warning: he picks on the audience so don't sit close unless you can take it, but it's all in good fun, great show!. George Wallace was entertaining but I definitely wouldn't see him again. Bally's pool was wonderful, although the cocktail service left something to be desired. We ordered drinks ($14 a piece frozen margaritas!) but the girl never came back even once to see if we wanted another round. There were plenty of chairs around lots of room to spread out. The Tequila Bar in the casino has some wonderful specials that are advertised around the casino, but they aren't on the menu so be sure to ask for them. $2 tacos margaritas draft beer and tequila shots. Everything was excellent. The Sidewalk Cafe serves breakfast and lunch, we ate breakfast there one day and loved every bite. Their french toast was perfect and my omelet was great. There is an indoor walkway to Paris which has a lot of other food choices. Don't miss their made to order crepes! I have stayed at just about every hotel on the strip and I would not stay at Ballys again.

Bally is dead central on the Vegas strip and within an arms throw from all the best happenings in town, so was an ideal choice that seemed to offer good value for money. It was, and we were not disappointed. The sales team were very helpful regarding group bookings right from the offset nine months before D-day when the planning started, but as we eventually did not have enough people to do a group rate booking, booked through Tripres. Despite all the internet hoo-haa about Tripres/Vegasview, my group of eight had no problems with their bookings at all. Check-in was seamless, and we all had nice large twin rooms on the 14th, 16th, and 18th floors of the north tower (went for that after the reviews on the web). They were clean, spacious, comfortable, and functional. So they charge $3/- a day for using the safe \u2013 so what? Well worth the peace of mind. Ballys suited our partying crowd down to a T, as we could walk the to all the other bars/clubs on the strip. Compared to all the other casino\u2019s we stepped into, I found Ballys spacious and well laid out, with all areas easily accessible. The pool has to be one of the best in Vegas, a classic area ideal for afternoon chilling and the weekend pool parties held there with resident DJ Roger de Gangi. Birthday meal was at Ballys steakhouse \u2013 great steaks, and efficient courteous service. As with my previous trip to Vegas, most of my daily sustenance was catered for by an ample meal of eggs \u2018easy-over\u2019 with bacon and toast at the Sidewalk Cafe each morning, that thankfully was in typical American Diner classic style with great service and value. Our group made good use of the rapid walkway through to sister casino Paris next door, which was spectacular, offering a wide range of bars/clubs/restaurants. We did venture out to my old stomping ground of three years ago at the Palms Resort off the strip on my birthday to go to the Ghostbar on the 55th (significant!) floor, to show the boys the spectacular view from the rooftop balcony there at night. But what a hassle with security letting in a group of eight 40 and 50 year olds who had pre-paid in advance! Was worth it in the end though. So can\u2019t really knock Ballys at all. I would recommend them to anyone and any group, whatever the function, who want to spend a few days in Las Vegas. No hesitation.

Also near the elevator as I had requested. The room was immediately available, and had a great partial view of the Bellagio fountains, Great room, large and clean, seemed to have been recently renovated. The room had one queen bed, with 2 side tables, plus a large table with 2 chairs, desk with chair, loveseat, and a plush armchair. large armuair, (sp)? with tube tv. (which i never used except for check out!) Plenty of drawer space, and closet space. Large immaculate bathroom, The bed was pillowtop, and extremely comfortable, with plenty of pillows.

All the staff were friendly and helpful, from the front desk people to housekeeping to belldesk to CW. i felt so very welcomed by everyone. i had to rent a scooter this trip, due to a broken bone in my foot, and the belldesk staff were great at explaining the functions and i felt very comfortable using it around the hotel, and even in the monorail. The slots were off and on at Ballys, but i did win enough to play for hours at a time, and had a few larger wins that i was happy with. C.W. were great, around all the time, never a problem with getting a drink or water. As for restaurants, i had breakfast 2 times at the sidewalk Cafe, and although the choices were limited in their buffet, the food was good and hot, and very resonable at $12.99 I did have room service 2 times, once for dinner and once for last morning breakfast. both times food was excellent and very resonably priced. Waited only 15 min. for the dinner one., but waited almost 1 hour for the Fri morning breakfast. The only other rest. i ate at in the hotel was nathans hot dog, It was ok.

This last trip, I had an offer to stay free for 5 nights and I couldn't resist. I admit I was a little concerned. I'd heard good things about the rooms but the way the hotel is situated so far back from the strip had always put me off. If you've been to Vegas, you can understand being reluctant to walk any further than you absolutely have to. It wasn't as much of a problem as I'd feared. The moving sidewalk thing from the strip helps a lot and if you're heading north, you can always cut across Flamingo and through Bill's. It's also connected via a corridor to Paris. I loved my room! It was huge by Vegas standards and extremely comfortable. I especially loved having the loveseat in the room, which was so comfortable for when I was using my laptop as I recuperated from my latest excursion. There's a nice computer table and chair as well but I liked also being able to see the TV, look out the window, and prop my feet up on the coffee table. I was in a North Tower room. I'd actually wanted a South Tower room for the strip view but I was able to see a good part of the strip from my room. The bathroom was nice-sized. The shower had good pressure and good hot water and the towels were good as well. The bed was comfortable and soft. The window was big and allowed a nice view. The elevators worked well. The TV was the old kind but it was a decent size and worked well with a good selection of channels. The drawbacks were that it was a considerable distance to the elevators to my room and another good hike from the elevator to get to my room. On the bright side, they did have express elevators for the upper floors. There's also not much in the way of places to eat. They had a few but they didn't really appeal to me for what it would cost to eat there. I ate at the Tequila Bar & Grill once. The burger was good but the service was really slow, even though they weren't busy. Bally's is connected to Paris, as I mentioned before, and it had several options for places to eat, many of them surprisingly affordable. The distance to the rooms and from the hotel to the strip is the only reason I rated it lower on location. It's close to several other hotel/casinos once you finally make it to the strip. It's also close to Ellis Island, a great place for affordable eats. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and hope to stay there again some time soon.

I booked a standard two bed room for two nights. When I checked in (surprisingly, the line up was not that long on a monday afternoon), I asked for an upgrade. The guy at the check in said I could upgrade for a north tower room, but it would cost me an extra $20 a night! I decided to check out the south tower room I was given, then make a decision. Turns out it was actually a really nice room. The room was very clean,the bathroom was really nice, but the view was Amazing! It was an odd numbered room, facing the south part of the strip. Out the window I had an awesome view of the Eiffel tower, Planet Hollywood, The Cosmopolitan, MGM grands, and best of all a very good view of Lake Bellagio. I had such a great view of the water show, I didn't even have to leave my room! (Though obviously I did, since this was Las Vegas). What I did not like is that there was no coffee maker in the room. I had to go either to the lobby or to the restaraunts to get a cup of coffee. Thankfully there was also a McDonalds within walking distance, by Harrahs (for those who prefer their McD's coffee). Overall, I thought my stay at Bally's was great! The hotel was clean, the staff was nice, and the casino was nice, though a little smokey. I did not expect it to be soo busy after reading the reviews, but it was. The best thing about Bally's definitely has to be the location. Being located right in the middle of the strip, I had great access to whichever end of the strip I wanted to go to. There were shops and restaraunts within walking distance.

Overall a very nice, comfortable room and for around $ 100/night, a great deal, in my opinion, considering Bally's location. The only negative was we had to change rooms the very 1st night due to roady neighbors (not Bally's fault) but Bally's accommodated us, apologized and gave us a new room without delay. The rest of the time, no problem. Ate in the Sidewalk Cafe twice - very good - but you must try their corn beef hash - the best I've ever eaten. I think Bally's could improve upon their air recirculation system because I think they are one of the smokiest casinos on the strip. As a non-smoker I don't like the smoke but put up with it. Since I was driving, the free parking was great (not typical at other properties) but the tips to get your car do add up. The pool was great but crowded. Two negatives: getting charged for internet usage and to use the room safe (!) - amenities lower tier hotels provide for free. Come on !! Overall a very nice stay.

Clearly they decided not to update the carpet. It was worn right down in all the usual wear spots in a room. The first 2 days we had wonderful housekeeping service. the last 3 days were horrible! All they did was remake the beds, empty garbage cans and provide new towels. I even called housekeeping to let them know they forgot to clear away our dirty drink glasses or clean the ashtrays. She assured me they would take care of it. Guess what? The next day, same thing! Dirty, untouched ashtrays, and the SAME dirty drink glasses, plus 2 more, still sitting on the desk. Called again, but it was of no use. They did clean the ashtrays, but yet AGAIN ignored the pina colada glasses (whipped cream long since hardened on). We did see the show Jubilee (my 2nd time) with BOGO tickets provided at check-in. It was a wonderful show! Well worth the money! Would recommend it to everybody! A true Las Vegas showgirl show! The valet service was wonderful, also. Always brought the car in a timely fashion. The casino was always neat and clean. The only other complaint was that they really need a Starbucks. Even the adjoining Paris doesn't have one! I thought Starbucks was in all the major hotel/casinos. Guess not. What they do have is a little coffee kiosk directly across from the front desk. They have a nice selection of coffees and pastries. Everything we tried was quite tasty. No complaints. The servers, however, need to polish up on their english.

Granted I was only a teenager at the time, I had a buddy along so we walked up and down the strip to Circus Circus everyday. Through the years, the Strip has changed but the hotel hasn't. I've stayed at Bally's a few times after that and the rooms have had minor upgrades here and there, nothing major. The rooms are spacious and every room we were in always had a sofa, which was nice. As of recently, the beds are dated and sagging but I've slept on far worse beds. They still have tube TV's but hopefully that'll change. One thing that I hope will change are their popcorn ceilings. The bathroom was spacious but when the toilet flushed, it was loud, you know, that public restroom SWOOSH kind of loud. Also, the shower head was some type of water saver so the stream of water wasn't quite strong for my taste. There are no resort fees, which the hotel really touts but, they charge $13.95 for internet access, what a rip off. The casino has remained the same over the years and their little shopping area has slowly deteriorated. I remember the pool was always fun, but it's been a few years since I've been there. Several family members have told us to try out the Sterling Brunch on Sundays but warned us on this trip to probably skip it as the quality has gone down. Well for $85 per, I'll take their word for it. Overall, Bally's is an okay place to stay, it's in the center of the Strip so you don't have to drive out, it's connected to Paris and within a short walking distance to the other casinos.

I love the location of this hotel as I stayed at Paris last year. I love how it's connected to Paris and very close to PH and the tram goes everywhere else from here! Our rooms were comped but we decided to upgrade to a jacuzzi suite(never used the jacuzzi though). I felt the room was a bit dated for a newly renovated North Tower room. Mold in the shower, stains on the sofa, chair, carpet, etc. I didn't like the view either. It faced the side of Bills Casino and it was on the 7th floor so the street noise made it very difficult to sleep at night. Having said all this, I would still stay here if given the opportunity because I love the location so much. I would definitely pick a higher floor though!

I have to compliment the front desk personnel as she went out of her way to get us rooms that were adjoining. I have absolutely no complaints about the stay at Bally's. My only issue on the week was with the Paris Resort, which adjoins Bally's. In the first 24 hours, when crossing over to the Paris side, we were stopped three times, by a Paris employee, with the question \"How are these young ladies related to you?\" In no way were my niece or her friend dressed as other than tourists, i.e. jeans, t-shirts, jackets, etc. This was extremely uncomfortable and after the third time we simply did not return to the Paris resort. After returning home I complained to Bally's in an email about the incident and received a polite email apologizing and explaining that it was Wyndham Resorts, a timeshare company, employee who was approaching us and they are taking care of the issue. I have been approached by Wyndham Resort sales people before and they have always identified themselves while the guy at the Paris did not identify himself. Even if Bally's explanation of the incident is correct it is very uncomfortable to be approached with the question: \"How are these young ladies related to you?\" In the future, if on my own or with male friends, I will consider staying at Bally's it is a wonderful resort at a great price and location.

When we arrived at the hotel, there was a lengthy check in (only 4 clerks on the desk) our room was a disaster, old and broken furniture and a big empty spot where the chair belonged. I called housekeeping for the missing chair and eventually a houseman arrived and told me there were no big chairs, but he had found a single chair in the hall with torn fabric that had arms on the chair. The next day I complained to asst mgr. Eric, who listened carefully to our concerns and promptly arranged for us to move to a room with more suitable furniture in the North Tower. The rest of our stay was pleasant in the renovated room with a comfortable chair for my elderly Mother. Prior to our check out we received a call from the bell captain saying they had drycleaning for a Joseph and was that person in our room. I clearly told them we had no drycleaning and there was no Joseph in our room. I did express check out to avoid the lengthy lines (our room was pre-paid for 4 nights and we charged no incidentals to the room). Upon returning home I received a statement showing they had charged $8.50 to my credit card for valet cleaning for Joseph! I called the hotel, and a desk clerk told me he couldn't handle the refund, that it would need to be done by asst mgr, Roxanne. After two further calls to Roxanne, I received a revised statement with the $8.50 charge for Joseph's drycleaning removed. This hotel is all about gambling. There clearly is no interest in serving room guests. Use of the pool involves a long walk from the North tower through the arcade of shops and restaurants in the basement. If you are staying in the South tower you must first walk through the entire casino in your swimsuit before descending to the basement and walking through the arcade. The hotel is lacking the most basic standard amenities and there are no coffee makers in the room. There is no free wifi in the Bally's /Paris complex, $12.99 per day is the charge to go online.

When we checked in we asked for a room with a view, we were told there was only one available and it was not clean yet, so we were happy to wait.

Beautiful. Our room, 7231 was HUGE. It was a double queen room and had a lot of room to spread out. The furniture was a bit scarred up, but was functional. The TV reception was poor, but that was not just for this room (my parents were staying in a suite which had the same problem.)

The sink was missing the nozzle, so the water kind of splashed on the counter when you washed your hands, brushed your teeth, etc. Most disappointing was the shower. The shower head was in desperate need of being replaced. The water flow was very poor and there was a strange odor, almost like a sewer smell, coming from the shower when you ran the water. It didn't make you feel the most clean. The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels were given. The comforter on the bed was changed after 3 days. The staff was always friendly and pleasant. The air conditioner was more than sufficient and cooled the room very quickly. The room was also very quiet, except for our final night we had some noisy neighbors, but they calmed down just after midnight.

This trip, I traveled with my 9-year-old daughter for a competition being held at a local arena, so our travel arrangements were made as a group and some decisions as to location of the group within the hotel and room class were out of my hands. However, I have come to the conclusion that why the experience was overall sub-par was because somehow Bally's staff is acting as though there aren't hundreds of other options for hotels of a similar class and location and are treating their guests as though the hotel is the only game in town. My first impression of the hotel was at the front driveway. I had rented a car, and was greeted with \"valet parking full\" as my welcome. I wasn't interested in valet or long term parking, only in dropping my bags, checking in, and moving the car when I was through. This is not an option at this hotel. The busy and pressed valet was relieved when I told him I was only interested in where to park in order to check in, and gave me directions to the garage which is shared with the neighboring Paris hotel. He did ask if I needed help with my bags, which I declined, though considering the very long walk from the parking garage through a shopping mall then through the casino floor to the check in counter, in hindsight I might have accepted. The line to check in was incredibly long. We waited 55 minutes to check in. I will compare this to my experience only a month earlier at the Aria, where I was checking in as a member of a large group (a couple thousand) from my company, which you can imagine led to long lines. At the Aria, every workstation was fully staffed, and there were waitresses working the line offering free water, as well as Aria staff making sure they answered our questions and helped manage the line. At Bally's, the very long counter had only three workers and they moved very slowly. One guest had an issue with the billing or the reservation, and that took one of the clerks out of circulation, which slowed the line down even more. During this wait, a worker came out of a room and matter-of-factly told someone she was on her lunch break. Well, sure, I'm sure you need it and earned it, but note to customer service folks, tired people waiting to check in after traveling to your hotel really don't need to hear that. When I finally did get to the agent, she was extremely efficient and polite and was a highlight of the hotel. The room. Well, we were given floor 5 in the North Tower. My room had a view of: a wall. There was a gravel roof for the adjoining floor (banquet hall or -- ?) directly below our windows, littered with cigarette butts from guests who chose to smoke in the non-smoking floor room. Well, we weren't here for the view, but it was disappointing. The room itself was clean and comfortable. However, signs of wear and use were to be found - peeling wallpaper in the bathroom, scuff marks everywhere. However, on the plus side, the rooms were very, very quiet and the beds were very comfortable, and large, plus the room was spacious and didn't feel crowded, with plenty of closet and drawer space for belongings. If my overall experience had been better, I would be happy to stay here again. I should note that the pool was closed, \"for the season\" which was disappointing, because even at that time of the year, it's not that cold during daylight and we would have taken advantage of the pool. Also, I paid for internet service which worked the first 15 minutes I used it, but didn't when I returned to the room later that day, or that evening when I finally had a window of time in which to call tech support. The support guy (from Cox) was great, but wanted to have someone come up to the room to check everything, and with a child who was competing the next day, I had to decline a late night visit. \"in 45 minutes or so\". The fees were waived, but it was an inconvenience to have to troubleshoot an internet connection that could have been disabled inadvertently by another guest, due to the way the service was set up. There was a person in our group who complained about what she thought was an excessive fee for the room on a weekend night, considering that there was absolutely no view, and was dealt with quite curtly by the agent, who stated that \"you should have said something to us right away and we would have changed it\" and \"that's the rate for that class of room\". The manager called over had the same attitude. Bally's, you need to understand customer service. You are not the only game in town. Service makes or breaks a place, and the \"take it or leave it\" attitude tells me to never intentionally visit again. With so many other choices in town, I will not seek out Bally's again. I discussed the same issue (viewless room) with the agent, and got the same attitude from the management. I don't complain often. In fact, I'm probably too easy to please, but that is the wrong tactic to take with guests. Sorry, Bally's, after waiting almost an hour just to check in, what makes you think that a reasonable person would want to request ANYTHING from the front desk staff? People don't travel to deal with inconveniences. A good travel experience is that the experience is seamless, and not a hassle. A great travel experience is that you feel welcomed and appreciated on top of that. Bally's totally dropped the ball.

They could pay their entire internet service bill for one month with one person's purchase. You would think by making so much money raping you with internet fees that they could put some of the 3,000% profit back into refurbishing their property. The hotel was horrendous. Do not expect to take a shower unless you don't want to wash off any soap because there is no water pressure. Also, be careful about moving around the shower head as it will pop off and hit you in the face. Sounds delightful right? By the third shower, my hand - eye coordination had improved tremendously from all the practice. I also may take up boxing since my defensive moves have improved from dodging the showerhead. You would think the jacuzzi tub would be a nice substitute for a shower that attacks you, however, it was possessed. Not only was it chipped in places, but it also turned on and off at will. At least that was comical. What was not comical was the air unit that did not work, the dirty hallways unvacuumed and littered with trash and broken glass, the upgraded room that had a television from 1990, the exit sign right outside our room that buzzed ridiculously loud, the carpet that had been oh so lovingly laid by carpet layers who obviously do not know that you are suppose to match the seams on patterned carpet, dirty bathrooms in the casino, and terrible dining. If chicken strips are the best thing on your menu, something is considerably wrong. The balcony had a nice view, however, after staying for a couple of days I understood why there was no access as I wanted to throw myself off the said balcony. I don't need to really elaborate anymore, but I would never stay at the hotel again and recommend that everyone else spend your money on a place that is equivalent to a Motel 6 or Roadway Inn.

The bed had white sheets which were pristine (something I always check) and were really comfortable.

There was just one hiccup in our trip, on the Sunday we came back up from breakfast to find our bathroom awash with black sewage pouring from the sink, maintenance was very quick he arrived within 5 minutes of one of the housekeepers ringing down. As the problem was sewage and very unhealthy and it was being walked in and out of the bathroom over the carpet we decided it would be best to change rooms, I spoke to the manager Jose who was very nice and immediately arranged for us to change rooms with free upgrade for the last 2 days of our stay for our inconvenience. We spent a lot of time in Paris, they have a lovely selection of restaurants and shops. We also spent a day at the Las Vegas shopping outlet , bought lots of bargains especially Levi's and wrangler jeans which were at incredible prices. We had a great stay and wouldnt hesitate to recommend the hotel to other family and friends. Just a word of warning, I have been to Las Vegas before so picked up straight away on the taxi drivers trick which was every time we got in a taxi they said they had to take a back route as the traffic was bad which effectively put between 7 - 10 dollars on the trip as sometimes they were going around in a circle.

She realized I told the thruth. 2nd room no better. Dirty stained carpets through out. Furnisher was majorly old and finish peeling off. Sink backed up. Dirty window view. Along with terrible bed. No comfort @ all. We didn't mind paying for an upgrade but this is unacceptable. Waited in line again for 10 mins to speak to the front desk clerks. I was told can't do anything only take another room. I said no this is the second room. So we just stuck it out and were very unhappy but made the best of Las Vegas.

The tub was slow to drain from the shower, but we had plenty of fresh towels and our room was always cleaned by 11am each morning.

I must say that all of the staff members we came across were super friendly and helpful, this includes everyone from the shop gal to the bartender to the dealers. The friendliness and location of this casino combined with the price (free) is a winning combination in my book. While Bally`s does not compare to the Venetian (the other hotel I frequent) it sure does serve up a great recipe for the price. We spent a lot of time in the tequila bar enjoying $2 mexican beers and $2 tacos. Note to Bally`s management - please change your promotional material throughout your hotel and website as you are still advertising $1 tacos. I recommend everyone give this cheap place a try. Well worth it for the price. They also have $2 margaritas. I spent a lot of time at the tables and although Blackjack used to be my game, Crazy 4 Poker has taken its place.

A hotel like this gets so many reviews so I will just give you my overall impression and a few short bits of information in quick point form.. Taxi from the airport, speak up and tell the driver to not use the tunnel because it costs approx. double to Bally's instead of the shorter route. The line up to check in is long and slow. ( 1.5 hours ) The management doesn't put on enough staff to accommodate the flow of people. Be kind to them it isn't their fault their managers don't staff appropriately. We stayed in a Grand Suite 2 nights and then in a standard room for 2 nights. Both in the North tower Reason we didn\u2019t have just one room is because we arrived later in the day upon check in and they didn\u2019t have enough standard rooms left for us so they bumped us up. Of course they didn\u2019t tell us this at first, we were just told that we were such nice people that we were being bumped up for 2 days. Later when we had to go down and be moved to a different room we were told the truth. The Grand Suite was neat to see and stay in for a few nights in all its 1985 glory but we liked the standard room better because it was newer and more comfortable. All in all Bally\u2019s is worth the money spent being that it is cheaper than most of the other hotels on the strip and you are in the middle of all the action. I probably won\u2019t stay here again but I would still recommend it to those on a budget. Buffet at the adjoining Paris Hotel was too long and expensive so we ended up eating at Denny\u2019s, Subway, and a few other out of the way places. Go downstairs in Bally\u2019s for better restaurants and shops. We found these on our last day which was too bad for us. Also the pool is closed at this time of year. We had the most fun downtown at the Fremont Street Experience and Fitzgerald\u2019s Casino.

Check-in was quick and easy -- the gal at check-in tried to tell me about upgrades, but I was in a hurry and on a budget so I cut her off, so I can't tell you what the opportunities might be. South Tower Room 5520, classified as a standard room with two queens, was large and very clean. The bathroom was also unusually large for a room in this price range. But the furnishings were old and the table was actually shabby (nicks, notches, burn marks, etc.). Other downscale touches -- the 27-inch CRT TV that was bolted to the table, and the table bolted to the floor, so you couldn't change the angle of the TV, and the half-broken clock radio. But at least the Serta Perfect Sleeper mattresses were nice and firm, and the wake-up call service was reliable. (Some places aren't. I always use the alarm on my cell phone as a backup.) I had one meal room service -- a terrific deal for $15 for a delicious small New York strip steak and four gigantic shrimp, vegetables and mashed potatoes. The casino is small and not particularly elegant by modern Vegas standards. But I found it a hoot that this place hires cocktail waitresses who are, shall we say, north of 30, and let's say, not anorexic. (They still make those ladies wear short skirts, but at least they have the decency to put them in opaque tights.) The odds are the odds wherever you gamble, a \"free\" beer tastes just as good here as anywhere, and no, that six-foot goddess in the micro-mini at the Venetian is not coming home with you anyway. The best thing about Bally's (besides the price) is the location. It's connected directly to Paris by an interior walkway lined with shops (that also has access to Paris' huge free self-park garage if you don't want to monkey around with valet). It's directly across the street from the magnificent Bellagio and its fountain, and kitty-corner from Caesars and its many attractions. And out back is a stop on the Monorail, the best way to get around Vegas if you're actually there to do business at the convention center. The basement monorail access hallway is also home to the sports book, a bunch of gift shops, the health club, a Nathan's Famous and a terrific Japanese restaurant. That's also where the pool is, but the pool is closed in January. It looked OK from the monorail, not as nice as, say, the Mirage, but then you aren't paying Mirage prices for the room, are you? Check-out was a breeze, fast and easy on a Saturday morning, and the staffer at the counter was happy with my compliments about the property. All told, I'd say Bally's is a fine choice for those doing Vegas on a budget. And the suites look really nice and are as bargain-priced as the standard rooms.

I stayed here in December 2010 and would highly recommend it. Last time I was in Las Vegas I stayed at the Bellagio, and I was wondering whether or not I would be disappointed by Ballys, but I was pleasantly surprised. My room was very large and, even with the huge king size bed, there was probably enough space to throw a disco party. The bed, by the way, was superbly comfortable. As well as the bed there was a luxurious sofa, a coffee table, three chairs and a desk in the corner. The room had two telephone handsets, a big TV with all the usual services (movies, hit TV, guest services etc) and a decent size bathroom with combined bath and shower and a hair dryer. There were plenty of towels (replaced daily) together with soaps, shampoos, body lotions and so on. I must also say that the room was very clean and the decor was nice. The room was a shade of caramel with a nice thick pile brown carpet. It is true that the paint had worn away on the odd small area and there was the odd scratch in the wallpaper, but this was not too bad and was not instantly apparent, I only noticed this on careful inspection. The location of the hotel is top notch. Bally\u2019s is right at the centre of the action and actually joins onto the Paris resort, so that they are effectively the same hotel. The Bellagio and Caesars Palace are just across the strip, to the left is Planet Hollywood and to the right are the slightly smaller hotels and bars which together make the teeming heart of the city. So you really are right in the centre of things with too many restaurants, bars, shops and casino\u2019s to mention literally minutes away from your room. There was no mini bar or extortionately priced snacks to tempt you inside the room (although there was a snack machine in the corridor near the lifts and, near Ballys casino, there is a p\u00e2tisserie which was open all hours (as of course were the casino bars)). My room didn\u2019t have a view either, but this did not bother me. (I was asked at check in whether I wanted to upgrade, perhaps if I had done so I would have had a better view). As for check in, well I am afraid it is true that you do have to wait. Or at least I did. There was a double lined queue and only about four check-in desks open. But this was a minor inconvenience only. I loved the Bellagio with its massive glass cage showers, opulent luxury and every little need catered for, but Bally\u2019s compares well in my opinion. If you want what feels like four star luxury in a prime location and can do without things such as bathroom scales, and if you want to feel like you\u2019ve made a relatively sensible choice, then you really can\u2019t do any better than to stay at Ballys.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Earl, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cThe location is great but the rooms were not.\u201d", "Author": "danesrule", "ReviewID": "UR89616879", "Content": "This was our first trip to Las Vegas and we heard that Bally's is located right where you want to be and the rooms are reasonable.

The bank of elevators for the South tower is poorly located at the far end of the casino so if you were walking from the parking garage you had quite a hike.

It's just that I never had a really great experience either. The property is a safe bet but just not special. Located in the heart of mid-strip, the hotel is central to most everything of interest. It also has a monorail station that is convenient for longer distance trips to the north and south strip areas. The hotel and casino are offset back from the strip so it is half a block walk just to get stripside - really kind of a hassle compared to other strip properties except maybe Caesars, Bellagio or the CityCenter area. Check-in lines can be long. The casino is not as large as some with a lot of under-utilized space but can be quite lively at times with a decent selection of tables and machines. The sportsbook is adequate if you like stadium seating and viewing. There are several dining and lounge options, some of which can be quite entertaining. The connection to the Paris property next door is convenient and useful if you want to upgrade your casino setting or avail yourself of better dining options. Access to the rooms was decent with plenty of elevators. The north tower rooms need renovation in their decor and ammenities. The TV's are old CRT models with limited channels, the bathrooms are small and a bit tattered, the furniture is dated, and the beds could use a mattress upgrade. The toilet in our room ran intermitantly and two days worth of calls to the front desk got us nothing but promises. It was never repaired. We had to shut the door to avoid having our sleep interrupted. However, the rooms were clean, quiet and comparatively large. Our view was non-existent but the hotel was rather full due to a convention and we were subject to the luck of the draw. Really, it was no big deal to us. It was not pool weather so I cannot comment on those facilities or those for exercise/spa. If location, price and access are important, then Bally's is a safe, reliable choice.

The casino it self was very old and dirty looking. Very smoky and stunk. The resturants were decent however. But the line to get a coffee from the shop by the front desk was long and slow. I reserved a room to overlook the fountains across the street but they did not honour it. So why take a reservation for it? The rooms in the north tower were very big which was nice. The bathroon needs work. We had a quilt on the bed with holes in it. Rugs were dirty. The beds were nice though,slept good and it was quiet. We rented a car and used the valet service which was great,they had super service. If all the employees worked this hard,it would be a fantastic hotel. All in all I would not stay there again.

We have been going to Vegas for years now & know it quite well. Before our trip we had read many of the reviews on this site. Almost all were good but some had us concerned, as we've stayed at many Vegas strip hotels, but never at Bally's. We had no need for concern! We had a very enjoyable stay & with a few minor exceptions we found Bally's to be a very nice place to stay. Many of the negative reviews on this site had to do with the age & cleanliness of the rooms & the attitude of the staff. We checked in on a Sunday at about 6:00 PM and when we arrived at the hotel there was a long line up. We were thinking \"oh, oh\" maybe what people had said about waiting in line for an hour to check in was true?! ! We only waited in line for about 20 min. At first there were only 3 front desk clerks on, but then 2 more showed up & we were through the line & checked in, in about 1/2 hour. The clerk, Lucy, was extremely friendly & helpful. We specifically asked for a high up room with a view. She even asked us what was more important to us the view or the height? We said both & thats what we got! 22nd flr. South Tower facing south strip & the Paris hotel & tower with a part view of Bellagio fountains. What a spectacular view! I was going to try the $20.00 tip approach that some people on this site said they had done & even had the money in my hand, but she granted our requests anyway. She did ask if we wanted a more upgraded room in the North Tower for an extra fee & we said no. If she had upgraded us to the North Tower for no extra fee I would have tipped her, but we certainly didn't need to. By the way Bally's internet site says that they take a $100.00 deposit per day on your credit card upon check in, but that wasn't the case. We even questioned her on this & she seemed kind of surprised at the question. It seems that only if you're planning on using the in room internet connection & phone alot that there is a deposit taken. Who wants to spend all their holiday time on the internet & phone anyway?! I know that I don't! Because we've been hearing alot about the bed bug epidemic all over North America we did a close inspection of our beds before we even unpacked. Everything was fine. VERY clean, comfortable beds & the room was HUGE!! Yes, the dresser drawers were a bit banged up in the corners & there were a few minor old stains on the carpet, but we weren't going to sweat it! So many people have complained about that stuff, but I say if you have time to be noticing every little scratch & tiny bit of grime in a corner somewhere then you're either too fussy, or spending way too much time in your room!! Its Las Vegas people, get out & have fun!! Without fail all the staff on all levels that we came in contact with were very friendly & helpful. The only criticisms we would have of the hotel are that the pool is a very long walk. Its situated at the back of the hotel, so especially from the South Tower its a long walk, as you have to go across the casino & then through the whole lower shopping mall to get there. My mother is a senior & really wanted to spend more time at the pool, but found the long walk to be too far for her convenience. However, I will say that once you're there the pool area is very clean & nice. Also, we found the ventilation in the casino at times to not be so good. I found that you could really notice the cigarette smoke and my throat was dry & my sinuses were acting up. Overall we would definately recommend Bally's! You can't beat the location, as it's right on the centre of the strip in the middle of all the action! I will be honest & say that our room was comped, except for one night, but even if you were paying for it I would say anything from $50.00 - $100.00 a night for the room we were in would be worth the money. It is a slightly older hotel & needs a bit of sprucing up here & there, but try & keep things in perspective. You're in Las Vegas on holidays, so don't get uptight about the little things! A few general travellers tips: 1) Buy the 3 day unlimited rides bus pass for $20.00 The bus service is very good. and they also have a new Gold Line which is an express bus that only stops at certain points on the strip, but is much faster. You can purchase tickets for the bus at machines that are located at most of the main strip stops. 2) DON'T buy the bottled water from the street vendors that sell them for $1.00. I had a few tummy troubles after drinking some of this water. I have a feeling that they just took old bottles & rinsed them out & put tap water into them & then sold them as new! Walgrens Drugs or any of the small stores on the strip sell bottled water cheap & its safe to drink. 3) We wouldn't recommend buying the 24hr. all access buffet pass.

Paid $20 extra per night to get upgraded from the south tower (which I hear is awful) to the north tower. The north tower room was spacious, clean and good value for the $45/night I paid. As for the casino... 20% of my gambling was at my hotel casino, Bally's. I had 2 brief combative exchanges at Bally's during my trip - both at Bally's. The first was with a pit boss, dressed in his sunday football jersey, who was responsible for playing the R&B music that was playing that night. All good for me. But him singing out loud to the music on his knees like he's Boyz II Men to a married woman at the blackjack table... distasteful and unprofessional. I asked this same guy about drink service, saying it's been about an hour. He snapped back \"No way has it been an hour\". I said \"well I was playing slots for 40 minutes before I sat here\", he said \"that's not my problem\". Nice. The other incident was with a roulette dealer. I walked up and gave him $100, asked for red chips which he gave me. I put some down and he said I can only play outside. I politely asked why, saying I've been playing red inside throughout my trip. He said \"and I'm sure that would be fine if the guy next to you wasn't playing red chips on the inside\". Ok sorry, I didn't notice him. Didn't need to ridicule, and you should have told me up front. I bet, lost, and walked away (a common theme for this trip!) Overall, drink service at Bally's is inconsistent. Sometimes I am asked if I want another 2 minutes later, but often I can't flag down a waitress if I had air traffic controller glowsticks. The sportsbook is all right. If you bet over $100 at the sportbook, ask for a drink voucher. They'll only give it to you when you ask, I learned this $600 later (hey, it was my first football sunday in vegas). Also, when I ordered a drink without one not knowing I would have to pay full price, the waitress said \"it's only free if you're betting horses\". She misinformed me, not sure why, but how could she not know? Overall, good trip even though I lost. I went to las vegas indoor skydiving which I think it well worth the $75. Bellagio is still the class act and it's nice to see a casino with good drink service and clean/classy decour, yet still have reasonable table limits for the middle class. This hotel gets 4 stars because it's all about bang for your buck. Great location and connected to Paris, which is a pretty solid casino itself.

We were on a non-smoking floor, had a view of the Paris pool, Eiffel tower, Paris balloon, south strip, and part of the Bellagio water show.

Everyone from doorman, to housekeeping to security were friendly and always thanked us for staying with them. Paris and Bally's seem like one hotel. I used the pool at Paris just cause I could. We had $1 tacos at the tequila bar on several occasions along with late night breakfast for 5bucks. Food was great. We also discovered Ellis Island right behind Bally's . . . .this is the BJ scene, Clean, friendly, pays 3-2. Woo hoo. we could walk in about 5 minutes.

Check in was quick and we were offered a \"free\" upgrade but was told that there wasn't much of a view.We were given a room in the North tower and we were on the 6th floor. The room was huge with one queen size bed, a double sofa and chair with a coffee table and a large dining table (which we didn't really use but was there if needed). We also had a fridge in the room which was really helpful for keeping our water nice and cold as it was very hot in the room. As we were told at check in, there wasn't much of a view and we looked out onto the car park and the side of the monorail but we weren't that bothered as we didn't intend spending much time in the room anyway. The room also had a dressing table and mirror area outside of the bathroom which was great for me to get ready if my husband was in the bathroom and there was also lots of storage space for hanging clothes and drawer space was plentiful too. We had a safe in the room which costs (approx) $4 a day but it gives peace of mind to know that our valuables are secure when we're not in the room. Housekeeping were nice and friendly and were in everyday to make the bed, replace the towels and restock us with any toiletries if needed. Now to the part that makes us NOT want to stay here again though (which is a shame). The service in the casino was absolutely terrible. It was virtually impossible to get a drink from the cocktail waitress as there were never any around. One evening we watched as one of them stood and talked to another member of staff for about 20 minutes and people were waiting to be served whilst playing the slot machines. My husband really got annoyed by this and refused to do anymore gambling in the casino and instead we started going across the road to Bill's every night where it was so much better. I have to say that we're not big gamblers but we do put a fair bit into the slot machines. I also wasn't particularly keen on the casino either. I know it's not anyone's fault but I felt that there was just no atmosphere and I got bored in there (which isn't like me at all). Overall, Bally's is a nice enough hotel and in a great location especially with having the Monorail station behind it but I can't see us staying there again.

A must is the Grand Canyon trip - we went by helicopter to the floor of the Canyon and had a champagne lunch. Expensive but well worth it. The Hoover Dam is also amazing.

They do not offer a free shuttle service, however, they recommended ShowtimeTours and for $12 you get a round trip ticket from the airport which was a good deal vs. paying for a cab. They only downside to that is you have to stop off at several other hotels to drop other passengers off depending on where you are located on the strip so it may take about 40 mins from the time you sit in the shuttle to the time you are in the line at check in. The check in line was fairly good except for the party of 50 Asian Tour Bus travellers infront of us with one check in window open for a Monday night. We were standing in line for about 10-15 minutes when they opened another window. Check in was a breeze and we stayed on the 12th floor in the North Tower. I got the two queen beds because it's nice to have an extra bed for clothes, shopping, stuff- the extra space is nice. The room and bathroom were very spacious and seemed clean enough which was a pleasant surprise. The only negative was the huge stain on the floor of \"whatever\" but this is Vegas and not a 5 star resort so we didn't care and besides you are never in your room anyways. We had a view of Paris next door & a partial view of the Fountains at Bellagio next door. This hotel is in a prime location in the middle of the strip so it just depends on how far you want to walk \"up or down\" it.

At other places it was not this bad. We did not make use of the shuttles etc. perhaps next time. We just walked all the way down to MGM and got as far up as the Venetian. It was about 100 degrees outside so take water with you. There are several restaurants in the Bally's/Paris casinos. We didn't get to try the ones in Paris but we ate at the Sidewalk cafe- Most disgusting food EVER!!!! Do not eat there. It's cheap and the food is horrible.

And if you saw my housekeeping at home you would know this is a unusual urge for me! You could see the dust and dirt at the edges of the hall. If you go with the South Tower bring your own cleaning supplies and perhaps sheets. We switched rooms after the first night so I will summarize both: South - second string on cleaning crew and linens. The sheets had lots of holes, definitely fodder for the rag bag. They were so gray my daughter put a t-shirt over hers as a pillow case. A few of the towels were either dirty and folded well or clean and folded very poorly. We decided on dirty to be sure. The caulk in the tub was black. The paint in the bathroom hadn't been touched in years and the wallpaper was peeling A LOT. Our furniture was so beat up I swear the stuff we got at Goodwill for my son's college apartment is nicer. The lamps were broken - not just nonfunctioning, but with lampshades askew, or in one case - below the light bulb. When they say \"nonrenovated\" to account for the price break, they mean NEVER renovated. The furniture has never been upgraded since the 70's. The cleaning crew was dismal. We came in to our room after it was made up and I thought my kids had made the beds. They were messy and lumpy. The carpet was just nasty. Overall just to unpleasant to stay in for three nights. North Tower room - better, but still holes in the sheets. Carpet still filthy, but a perfectly adequate room. Since the building is older the ventilation in the casino is horrible. It is the smokiest one we went in. I think they compensate for this by keeping the AC cranked up. The halls in the towers were like meat coolers. Again, if you must stay here (we had a wedding reception there and didn't want a long walk back afterward) go with the North Tower and then get to another casino to play. Unless you are a smoker, in which case you won't mind. Bright spots - the pool staff is very friendly. They'll help you scrounge for chairs when it's full and are very welcoming. The pool, sadly is nothing special and quite loud. (We coveted the Ballagio Pool A LOT). There's no catch to the $1 margaritas and tacos at Tequila's and the bartender was great.

Our room for four nights ended up being a total of $674, which I felt was not much of a bargain. Part of the price was an upgrade which cost an add. $80. The upgrade was offered at check in for the North Tower that we were told had been redone. If these rooms were the refurbished rooms I would not have wanted to see the South Tower. The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable and the towels plentiful. The carpet was old and worn with stains in places but did look like it had recently been cleaned. The bathroom was clean, no mold around the tub/shower and the shower curtain was clean. Around the vanity though the wood was marked with peeling paint and chips in the wood and the wallpaper. Check in was easy as there were very few people at the hotel when we checked in on a Wed evening. The tables and slots had almost no one at them, I had never seen a casino this empty before. But I will say the airport was pretty empty also. Our cap driver did say that things were slow. We had breakfast the first morning at Ballys buffett, but was not worth the $10.99 it cost. Very limited selection and there was only one person working to refill items and there were enough people eating that most dishes were empty for a while, the wait staff though were very good. All in all this is an ok place to stay if you get a good room rate. Nothing fancy but nothing horrible either. The greatest drawback in my opinion was the distance you had to go to get to the pool. Yes it is a nice pool with lots going on there but it is a good 15 min walk from your room.

For the North tower we experienced no issues with the elevators (as I have noted from previous reviews).

This continued for 10 minutes and no one had shown up, nor did anyone follow up with us. The next morning I went down to security and spoke to the manager as to why no one was sent up, they had said that the front desk had never informed them of a complaint, so that's why no one was ever sent up. After this conversation I went and spoke to the front desk manager who was again apologetic but that was it, she never addressed the fact that her staff did nothing when I had called that evening for security to be sent up. She offered nothing for the inconvenience that we had experienced. I had told her that I was very unhappy with the service and the way the hotel and staff had handled this situation.

We got asked about 4 times on the way to the elevator to get to our room. They just want you to tour the new hotel they are building, and there is no obligation to buy a time share. After it's all over, you have been fed, and get free show tickets. I would try it out, but I don't know why they want my credit card number. This makes me nervous, and is the reason I always say no. A couple tips to avoid the sales people - you have to be at least 25 and married. We would always say that we are younger, or we're leaving tonight, no time for a show. The room was nice. Updated within the last few days. Very large bathroom which was nice. Full closet. Couch and coffee table, as well as a desk. Very very spacious room. Probably one of the largest rooms I have been in. Nice view of the strip facing north. We were there for 5 nights. The room never got vaccummed. I spilled some crummbs in a very visible place on night 1, and they were still there when we left. We ran out of tissues that were never replaced, and I'm not convinced that our sheets were ever changed. We stayed in the North tower. Apparently this is the older one. You could see age in the hallways, but the rooms were very nice. My only complaint is that the room was actually pretty far away from the hotel lobby. We were near the back of the tower, elevators quite far, so to get out to the LV Blvd Sidewalk took a good 5-10 mins of walking. I had no problem with it, just would have been nicer to have been closer. The casino and lobby area are nice, although we didn't spend much time there. They didn't have any of the table games we liked open. They had a lot of tables closed when it was busy, which was strange to me. The esplanade down below the lobby floor is handy. A few gift stores and restos to grab a bite late at night. The pool is also down here, but was closed when we got there, which we did not know about. We were able to use the pool at Paris, but we did not. At the end of the esplanade, there is a stairway to go up to the monorail. We used this to go to the sahara ave area a few times. It was very quick, and handy. I don't think it's worth the price to go one or two stops, but when you want to travel the strip end to end, there is no faster way. The front of Bally's is awesome. Long moving sidewalks and escalators to get you up to the lobby. Neon lights, waterfalls and gardens. Quite the site at night and day time. Overall a great stay.

On the last night when getting ready for dinner out with friends - while sitting on the 'throne', brown water dripped down on my head and back. I looked up to see the ceiling was bulging like a balloon holding back water. The brown water that dripped on me was most likely sewage from an overflowing toilet in the room above us. I called the hotel operator who sent a plumber. The plumber said the most obvious - that he had to move us to another room. This would have made us late for our dinner reservations with friends so I said we'd have to deal with moving us when we got back from dinner. A few hours later, we came back from dinner and I went immediately to front desk. The plumber had not notified the desk of bathroom disaster. Front desk clerk did not care about the sewage, nor the mess, nor the hassle that their hotel's negligence in maintaining their property caused us. The hotel manager would only offer us the obvious - a new room and a $25 voucher for dinner, which was pointless - We had already eaten and It was close to 10pm, on our last night, we had to check out by 4am that morning to catch flight.

It was VERY convenient being around the corner from the ice machine and elevators but not too close to be disturbing. Our room was clean and with plenty of towels for 2 people. The AC could have worked alittle better, but I've heard the same about other hotels as well. I would have like to have had a refrigerator, but was not going to pay the extra $15.

We were prepared thought and brought a soft sided cooler (fit in suitcase) and some zip lock bags for the ice and it worked prefectly to keep our snackes and left overs (midnight munchies!) nice and cold.We also bought mugs at a little store for our drinks. I don't like those little glasses in the rooms. We did not use the safe either as their was a charge for that as well. We just locked our suitcases when out. The location for us was just perfect. Sort of in the middle of everything. Walkways and overpasses are very convenient and near by. Duece bus stop was right up at the Flamingo and I recommend it for going to either end of the stirp or Freemont street. It's only $7 for a 24 hour pass. Well worth it, although they can get a bit crowded later in the evening. Jubilee show was absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend it. Old style Las Vegas show. Breakfast Buffet at the cafe ($10.99) was ok. Nothing special but good food, friendly servers and quick in and out to start your day off.

It was more than enough time to take the true pulse of this aging but still vibrant resort. This is the third year in a row I have stayed at Bally's and the quality and overall experience are consistent. My room this year was on the eighth floor of the North Tower. The room itself was quite acceptable with nice touches like marble tabletops and vanities in the bathroom. The A/C unit was excellent and maintained the room temperature consistently and without fuss or noise. The carpets in the room are getting a little worn and could do with updating. The paint on the cabinetry in the bathroom was peeling rather badly and again this needs refurbishing. The plumbing worked well. There were NO bed bugs, a plus in this day and age of wide dissemination of same now that the ecofreak crowd has been successful in doing away with the only truly successful eradicant of these disgusting pests, DDT. Still, it does not hurt and is probably wise to carefully inspect your hotel room, any hotel room, carefully upon check-in for these vermin. The room was for the most part quite quiet except for two nights when drunken revelers came staggering down the hall, shouting and carousing and banging into doors. But this is expected in the Entertainment Capital of the World, right??! The price of the room was quite reasonable except for Friday and Saturday nights when it rises to rather lofty extremes contingent upon demand. Sunday through Thursday are the best nights for price. The thing about Bally's that is so attractive is that it is located smack dab in the middle of the Strip and everything is convenient. Bellagio is just across the Strip, Paris is next door, City Center is close as are the Venetian, the Palazzo and Caesar's Palace. The other thing about Bally's is that it has one of the very best steakhouses on the Strip and the BEST by far Sunday Brunch in the form of the Sterling Brunch. This is absolutely the best brunch in the city and is not to be missed. The food, champagne, caviar, lobster and prime rib as well as the rack of lamb and seafood offerings are without doubt the best quality there is to be had in LV currently and the price is very reasonable at $85 for 5-6 hours of sheer eating and drinking bliss. Ilario, the manager of both the steakhouse and the Sterling Brunch is a true gentleman and maintains a very, very high level of quality in this establishment. For those desiring more economical sustenance, there is what I refer to as the \"basement\" (pool level) where there is a Sbarro's, a Nathan's, a Haagen-Dazs ice cream outlet and a Japanese restaurant. All are good, especially the ice cream outlet. The pool at Bally's is large and single without ostentation and can be quite raucous on week-ends where amplified music keeps the largely young crowd involved. One thing I do not like about the pool set-up is that, in contrast to most of the better resorts on the Strip, it is open to the public. Instead of showing your room key for admission, you simply walk right in. Not too exclusive but the place is pleasant overall nevertheless. Unfortunately, there is no hot tub access unless you pay an additional fee for same at the Spa. The housekeeping staff at Bally's is top-notch. They are efficient and honest and keep the rooms clean and well-supplied. They are happy to come to your room late in the day to make it up if you request so by telephone.

We are from Eastern Pennsylvania, a long way from home, but felt safe and secure at Ballys. We will surely stay at Ballys again in the future! \"Thank you Ballys for your outstanding hospitality.\"", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunnyvale, California", "Title": "\u201ca right choice baby\u201d", "Author": "PrabhakarBelavadi", "ReviewID": "UR71840593", "Content": "nice reception, good rooms, cordial atlmosphere, centrally located at the strip, reasonable charges satisfying all budgets.

I checked in Sat June 19th for 1 week and returned home Sat June 26th. I booked a package from Vancouver to Vegas, with Air and Hotel, for staying at Bally\u2019s. I\u2019ve been to Vegas over a dozen times so an elaborate hotel wasn\u2019t my priority. I was simply there to relax in the hot sun by the pool during the day and read some books, and walk, shop, whatever in the evening. I hadn\u2019t stayed centre-strip in a long time so decided to give Bally\u2019s a try. With all the resort fees at many other properties, the price was the same for my package to try Bally\u2019s. I am usually an MGM or Excalibur fan due to their pool set ups. I\u2019ve tried the Flamingo Hilton too in the past. I don\u2019t gamble so cannot comment on their casinos. I have read some online reviews so was a bit worrisome about Bally\u2019s. I suppose if your expectations are super high, as it is Vegas, then you might be disappointed. I must have totally lucked out, as when I arrived at the hotel to check in around 7pm Saturday there were only 2 people in front of me in line. Mind you, those 2 people seemed to take forever to check in so this front desk team isn\u2019t the speediest around. My check in was quick once at the agent, got the non-smoking quiet room I requested, and was on my way. I was in the North Tower and it only took about 3 minute to walk to my elevators. Many online reviews say the walk to the North Tower is long, but it isn\u2019t unless you stop to talk or get a drink. During my week at Bally\u2019s, I never had to wait more than 30seconds for an elevator. It was quick. My room was high up and had a view of the roof, but I didn\u2019t care about view, just a quiet n/s room, so was very very happy. Getting a n/s room in Vegas is a challenge. Anyhow, the rooms in the North Tower facing Flamingo Road were noisy that week due to roadwork so my non-view on the other side of the building was good after all \u2013 to be honest if I put my face next to the window, I could see the Bellagio Hotel and the fountains going at night too. The rooms at Bally\u2019s are huge, clean, and well kept in my opinion \u2013 I must have been in a different North Tower room than that of the negative reviews online. There was a large closet, spacious bathroom, small desk mid-room, armoir with TV/drawers/ice bucket, and then another desk (much larger desk) and a sitting area with a love seat sized sofa and coffee table. It was by far the largest room I\u2019ve ever had in Vegas. I found the king bed very comfy and there were 4 pillows too and all were plump and full - had a great sleep every night. The walk to the pool area was quick and took 3-4minutes from my room to the pool. The elevators in the North Tower go right down to the shops area in the pool level \u2013 just walk thru there for a quick walk to the pool. The pool area consists of one huge pool, plus a 100-person hot tub (so I\u2019ve heard) but the jets were never going in the hot tub and it was more like a kids pool or just a smaller place to relax in the water. The large pool is awesome: there is a sitting bench/wall in the pool along the entire length which is perfect in the heat to drop yourself there with a drink and book for the day. They also have several seats for 2 or 3 people around their pool where it gets deeper. There is also a deep end for swimming laps. I saw people on floating mattresses which you could rent too. The food place at the pool has good variety and at reasonable prices (reasonable for Vegas). The drinks are where the hotel nails you for money. I ordered what would be considered a slushy virgin drink at 7-Eleven and it cost me $eight for a small at Bally\u2019s pool. They are always playing music at their pool. However, on Fridays/Saturdays/Sundays be prepared because the week I was there at 12:30noon those days their DJ comes alive and cranks up the music for a pool party \u2013 on one day there it was so loud you could barely hear the person next to you talking. If you are a person who likes to sit in the shade by the pool, then at Bally\u2019s you\u2019ll have to rent a cabana \u2026 they have no shad at their pool after about 10:30am. If you are a person who thrives on ambience then this likely isn\u2019t the best pool complex in Vegas for d\u00e9cor. All the staff I encountered at Bally\u2019s were awesome, friendly, polite, helpful. Bally\u2019s Hotel is very easy to find your way around. I didn\u2019t like that Bally\u2019s no longer had their own buffet outside of Sunday brunch. You had to go next door to the Paris Hotel, and their buffet lines can be super long at over an hour at times. There are several food options at Bally\u2019s, like the food court type of options on the pool level on the walk to the pool/tram (sushi, pizza place has huge variety, deli place). The food options at the Paris Hotel were all delicious, but pricy too. They also have 24-hour buffet deals but I didn\u2019t do that option. If you are looking for cheap bottled water on the strip near Bally\u2019s there are a few options. Next door to the Paris Hotel in the Planet Hollywood miracle mile shops there is the ABC Store which sells bottles of water. If you exit Bally\u2019s by the doors near the North Tower, that intersection (on Flamingo Road which is parallel to Las Vegas Blvd but 1 block off) has a 24hour place that sells various 7-Eleven type of items \u2013 I cannot remember its name but the sign on the building says something like \u201cour lease has another 20 years on it\u201d and the place is attached to a bar. If you\u2019re up for a longer walk, over next to Monte Carlo is a pharmacy (CVS I think) selling various items and bottled water. Same across the street from Monte Carlo is another pharmacy (Walgreens) with great prices. Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes, but it\u2019s not a priority to stay there again. I enjoyed myself but wouldn\u2019t mind another property too. I am flexible where to stay next and it\u2019s more about convenience of the pool, location I want for that trip, and price.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, CA", "Title": "\u201cPoor Service, Loud Rooms\u201d", "Author": "JeremyRiverside_CA", "ReviewID": "UR71533995", "Content": "The hotel screwed up my reservation and placed me in an inferior room when I paid for a suite.

It was SO WORTH IT ..... ask for cabana 8, 9 0r 10 - they are right by the kid's pool, and 10 steps from the adult pool.

She offered an upgrade to a Jacuzzi suite for $50 more a night but was not pushy or indignant when we declined the upgrade and stuck with our original non-smoking king sized bed room. I have been at other places that tried the hard sell for the upgrade, which greatly annoys me, but there was none of that here. Just a quick couple of computer taps, more smiling, room keys and directions to the elevators. Check-in was a breeze. We got to the room and could not believe how big the room was. The bedroom area was roomy with enough space for 2 night stands, desk, desk chair, a big comfy chair and TV armoire. There was plenty of space to walk around without bumping into each other or the furniture. Plus there was a space for the suitcases so we didn\u2019t have to worry about tripping over them.

I came with mediocre expectations, but was pleasantly surprised! Room service was great, no dishes left in the halls, no noise from the other rooms or hallways, rooms were cleaned by 2 pm daily, so it was a perfect stay. Casino was always busy, and the band (JAMM) performing at the Indingo lounge was AWESOME! Don't know if there is a buffet at Bally's but we bought the Buffet-to-Buffet 24 hour passes (best deal on the planet) and enjoyed Paris, Harrahs and Planet Holywood buffets the best. The location is great! Easy access to the monorail, and the bus stop for busses going downtown. We used the free shuttle to Rio Suites, very short wait time and very convenient. We met up with our cousins from Australia, who we learned a few weeks before our vacation were also going to be staying at Bally's. They also had a great stay. We came with another couple, who's been coming to Las Vegas to celebrate their anniversary for the last 15 years. This was their first time at Bally's and they loved it!

When I arrived at around noon hour there was a fairly long line of people checking in. It still did take around 45 minutes to make it to the front counter and the agent. As I was checking in solo I made a request for a non smoking king bed room but because of the early check in I was only given the option of non smoking 2 doubles. I didn't want to wait so I decided to take it. To the south tower I go. I have to say for some of the negative reviews of these particular rooms, I had no issues in what was presented in front of me. I walked in to a very large room with a great view of Caesars, Mirage and a part view of Bellagio and the fountains. Now the room is a bit out of date with its older furnishings but that did not bother me at all. Bed was nice and soft and the air conditioning worked great. Sure there was a spot of wallpaper peeling in the bathroom and a cracked tile as well but nothing that was overblown. Its an older tower and unrenovated so I would say it was quite good knowing that. The non smoking room did have a bit of a minor smoking smell to it but nothing that made me nauseous. For a comped room I was very pleased and wouldn't hesitate staying in those rooms again even if I had to pay. Room service was mediocre as it didn't arrive hot on 2 occasions and was slightly overpriced. As for the casino itself, very very smokey. I did get headaches from the strong smell. Again because its an older casino with poor ventilation. I liked the fact that it was attached to Paris by a nice indoor walkway lined with stores and restaurants. I like the casino in Paris so it was a bonus. I did have a rent a car this trip and used the self park on multiple occasions. It shares with Paris and makes for quite a long hike to get to where the rooms are located. No big deal breaker. Overall I was impressed by Bally's for a basic clean hotel with superb location.

We attempted to check in early, around 9am, but a room was not ready yet. A very nice lady named Rene helped us check in and gave us a room number, and told us to check back in a few hours to pick up the keys as the room had not yet been cleaned. Checked our bags with the bell desk, and they informed us that they would bring them to our room when it was ready. We were able to pick up our keys around 12noon, and had a South Tower room (which was comped). We were offered a North Tower upgrade for $25 per night but declined. We were surprised at how spacious the room was! The furnishings are a little old and the carpet was a little lumpy, but the room was extremely clean. We were very happy with the room, and the view was absolutely awesome! You could see the whole south strip plus the Paris pool, as well as about half of the Bellagio fountains. It was a beautiful view both day and night. I have included photos of the room, as well as the carpet and of the view. All of the staff we encountered during our stay was very nice and friendly. Housekeeping did an excellent job cleaning our room each day. The only complaints we had was that there were not enough pillows for the bed, only three very small pillows. My husband says the bed was not comfortable enough for his liking, but I was satisfied with it. The showerhead in the bathroom was likely the worst showerhead on the planet. The water came out in one strong stream, but we managed. The casino at Bally's is always pretty busy and has a lively atmosphere. We listened to live music a few nights, which was really good.

I gave it a 4 rating because of its prime location, drinks service and casino area. taxi from the airport costs about $25-30 including tip. We stayed in the older part of the hotel (the south tower?) and after some of the reviews I was a bit worried. Not necessary! Yes I agree it was tired but good value for money with the great room rates available (paid about \u00a330 per room per night for 6 nights so great value for money), the rooms were HUGE, plenty of room with 2 twin beds, older/damaged furniture though purely down to guest abuse I would imagine (which if replaced would make it feel much higher quality), its not a flat screen tv yet but it does the job so not a big deal. Bathrooms were big, good shower, plenty hot water, plenty towels & big mirrors. Rooms were clean, cant fault that,. Im sure over time this area will get a re-furb as well, but to maintain building of this size with the amount of guests it must be a never ending task. How long do you spend in your room in Vegas anyway? the hotel charges $3 per day for the safe, I think they should scrap this, really it is expected now in hotels such as this but still its a nominal fee at least. The casino area was good, was always really busy, very entertaining and the drinks service/cocktail waitresses were good, the pool was a great size with plenty loungers. The bufftet was always busy but I never ate there so cant comment, did look like good value for money though. Everything is close by, paris is linked by a nice walkway (with a good little live music bar en route), bellagio & ceasars palace just across the road, planet hollywood & paris on one side and bills gaming hall & flamingo on the other. I slept well in this hotel, quiet for the area and never heard any other guests, we were at the end of a very long corridor ao this may have been why.... I never experienced a long check in line, it was about 15-20 mins, but i did see some long lines, i guess thats just luck. I saw some man being a bit irrate with one of the reception staff, really getting him no where and it was not the poor girls fault some guests take longer than others.

My friend was departing a day before us on 6/9/10 so I went to the front desk and asked to keep her room (2 doors down from mine) so I would have a bed that was not falling apart. They told me that would not be a problem. To shorten this review I will say that I made 5 trips to the front desk taking up most of my day to get this taken care of just to get a message on my room phone that they were going to charge me an extra $44.00 to keep room #6225. Keep in mind the only difference in the rooms were the broken head board. I again made a trip to the front desk and stood in line another 45 minutes to get this corrected. The $44.00 charge was removed as they acted like they were doing me a favor when my reservation papers (in hand) showed that I was not to pay for that night anyway. Bally's in no way tried to compensate us for our trouble of wasting an entire day trying to correct their mistake.

Yes the television was older, and not a flat screen, but the picture was fine and we didn\u2019t watch TV anyway. It was a very quiet room; we never heard other guests or noises from adjacent rooms, which is rare in Vegas. The only complaint I had was that there was some sort brown schmutz on the woodwork above the desk near the ceiling that was rather gross, and there was a ripped up receipt behind the nightstand that had probably been there a while. We did not have the cleaning staff make up our room while there, so I can\u2019t comment on the staff other than they honored our Do not Disturb sign. Food: Paris is connected to Ballys, and offered many good restaurant choices. At Ballys we all had the $1 tacos and margaritas at the Tequila bar, and all in our party agreed that they were decent to good. Don\u2019t waste the 10 bucks for the Express Breakfast Buffet, it\u2019s cheap, but the lines are long and there was nothing to choose from. We all very much enjoyed the Spice Market buffet at nearby Planet Hollywood. Drinks: We never went without drinks while playing in the casino; and we all found the waitresses and bartenders to be friendly and attentive. Tables/Slots: Of all the places we played at on and off the strip, Ballys was the best for all those in our party. Aside from 2, all of us walked away with winnings from either playing the slots, poker or roulette. Pool: We had friends who arrived on a Saturday. They said the crowd at the pool was absolutely insane, with empty cups and cigarette butts floating in the water, music thumping and lots of drunks. We all met at the pool Monday afternoon, and it was a completely different scene \u2014clean, no trash, and mellow music. I suppose the weekend crowds are larger and notably rowdier, which is why my husband I usually like to come to Vegas during the week. Spa: The spa itself is nothing special but the staff was very helpful and friendly and everything was sparkling clean. I loved their steam room; it had just the right amount of steam and eucalyptus. I had an 80-minute signature massage that included hot stones. I\u2019m a spa junkie, and I was pleasingly surprised at the quality of the massage. My mom had the same massage and the pomegranate facial and was happy with both. Although we enjoyed the facility and the services at the spa, I would probably opt to try the spa at Caesars or the Bellagio next time, just for an added bit of decadence. Overall, we would return to Ballys. The location is great, yes it\u2019s a bit dated and lacks the granduer of the Bellagio and the Venetien, but the price is right, it\u2019s clean, and we were happy with the service.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cGreat time\u201d", "Author": "NEcruiser9", "ReviewID": "UR67023950", "Content": "We thought that Ballys was a great location and we couldn't beat the price for what we got.

Word of advice - book a transfer before you go! A taxi will cost you $25-$30 from the airport and about $15 on the way back. I believe transfers are around $10-$15 return per person, so it's worth it. At check-in, the clerk advised me I was booked in a South Tower room. I'd heard those rooms were not the greatest, so I asked if there were any upgrades available. She offered us a jacuzzi suite, but the room only had a king size bed and we needed two beds. We settled for a 17th floor Deluxe room in the North Tower and gave the clerk $20 for her efforts. The room was very clean and surprisingly large - about 450 sq ft. - enough room for the two of us to mill around without being under each other's feet and the bathroom was big enough for two people to get ready at the same time. Full length mirror, makeup mirror and lots of counter space. The TV was old (but who cares, we weren't there to watch TV!) and there was no fridge, but you can just use a garbage can to fill with water & ice and you've got a fantastic cooler for your drinks! If you plan on keeping food in your room, you might be SOL - not sure if they have mini fridges or not. Aside from the fan on the AC unit, it was very quiet. If you are a light sleeper, maybe ear plugs are a good option but it didn't really bother me. We actually kept the DND sign on our door the whole time we were there - we would get back to our room between 4am-6am and didn't want to be woken up. The housekeeping department did call our room later in the evening to see if we needed anything so the service is quite good. We asked for extra towels and they arrived within 10 minutes. Downside is that they have no other toiletries - I had forgotten my razor and hair gel but they didn't have any. I know some of the more expensive hotels carry these items. All in all, I found the hotel to be quite enjoyable. Yes, the casino was smokey, but they all are. Considering we were only there to sleep and get ready, it was everything we needed. The location was perfect for what we had planned - I enjoy walking, so I didn't have any problem. I even walked to Mandalay Bay and back. Just wear comfy shoes! For those who don't enjoy walking, there is the monorail that stops at Bally's. Didn't go on it, so I have no comments on it. I suppose if I had money to burn, I could go for a fancier place, but I don't.

Finally, my Total Rewards account showed all nights comped for my 4-night stay, and I booked it. I am sure that the comped room should have been a South Tower standard room, but when I checked in around 5:00 pm on a Wed afternoon, I tipped the very polite check-in clerk a $20 bill and he said \"let me see what I can do\". I really wanted a nice room on a high floor with a view. He gave me the 22nd floor in the North Tower, facing the Paris hotel and with a slight side view of the Bellagio fountains on the far right of my view. Just perfect! The room is very large for a \"Standard\" room in Vegas. About 450 square feet, I believe. The North Tower rooms are the most recently renovated rooms at Ballys, and I wasn't disappointed. Nice, comfortable king bed. Small love seat with a small, glass coffee table. There were also 2 other desks each with their own chair. The bathroom was decorated with nice, clean marble. The shower was a tub-shower combo, but in decent shape. I prefer to have separate walk-in showers and tubs, but I knew in advance that the regular rooms here only have tub/shower combos. The shower head was the only thing that could have been improved; very uneven water flow, and adjustments didn't help. But shower pressure was good, and temperature was never a problem. I had a smoking room, but the room always smelled fresh upon my return. And the maid refreshed the room each day while I was gone, and kept the room looking nice and fresh. Always a fresh supply of towels and soaps/shampoos. I did use the safe, so I didn't mind the $3 per day fee. I was able to use my comps to pay for those, so my final bill at check-out was still $0. Yay! Check-out over the TV was simple, quick and easy, of course. I don't understand the need to ever stand in line to check-out of a hotel, when the TV check-out is available. I used the pool and the spa, and enjoyed both. The casino at Ballys is decent, although I didn't have much luck, here. I won at other casinos during my trip, but not at Ballys. But that's how luck flows....... The central location of Ballys allowed me to wander the strip as far down as MGM, NYNY, and as far up as Mirage. Easy walking around, and the monorial in back is very convenient to use for longer travels. I had very little to complain about my stay at Ballys, and I hope to be back.

We don't spend a lot of time in the room so a fancy room was not important for us. The service was very good in the hotel and there is an awesome deli right at the bottom of the elevator that has great breakfast and lunch foods. It was quiet at night as well, no screaming partiers. My only issue was that they close the cafe at 2 pm so if you want food at supper time, it has to be either the fancier restaurants there or the Mexican Tequila bar or go elsewhere. I think it is a big mistake to not have a cafe with long hours (open at least until midnight) but that was the only thing I really didn't like. Anyway, if you want a smokin' deal on a clean, convenient room- I absolutely recommend Bally's. If you want a more modern, up-to-date room, it might not be for you.

We've stayed at Bally's several times and have never been disappointed, but have learned it's worth the effort (money?) to get a north tower room after once being in the south tower. We'd booked the \"standard\" room, but Joey at check-in was great and put us in a king non-smoking \"suite\" (just a larger room with extra vanity and dressing area) in the north tower. I did the $20 tip routine when I gave him my credit card and ID, but I think he'd likely have done it regardless. He made sure we were on the quiet side due to road construction at night on Flamingo. The room was huge by Vegas standards, and bright with floor-to-ceiling windows. The bed was very comfortable and we slept soundly every night. The view was southerly, over the pool, tennis courts, part of the strip and the airport. Housekeeping was thorough and even put out extra soap, toiletries and towels when they noticed we were using both vanities. The room and hallway were quite clean, in contrast to what some others posting here have experienced. Bally's is a gem in terms of accommodations, staff quality, and location relative to price. Yes, it's a bit shopworn in places (as are many of the casinos at this point), but they don't charge you as if it's the newest thing in town either. I sure hope they don't change their niche. My biggest gripe is with Harrah's and other strip locations in general. The gaming odds (blackjack, video poker) are poor. Heck, I always lose anyway, but at least I do it more slowly at the places with better payouts. Harrah's, maybe you'd make more in the long run with better odds, since some of your patrons might spend more time gambling in-house rather than elsewhere.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philippines", "Title": "\u201cTips Tips Tips\u201d", "Author": "visitvacations", "ReviewID": "UR60053661", "Content": "Stayed on this hotel last March 21 for 3 days... got it from hotwire but could have gotten a better deal by going direct through it's promo over the internet.

Clean for the most part, the shower in the bathroom was dirty, paint was chipping, older so whatever. The bed was clean but under it hadn't been vacuumed in a very long time. When we had to swich, it was done quickly and efficiently. Went into a standard room also in the North tower. Nothing special, but it was larger than we expected for a regular room. T.V. was tiny. no coffee maker. The room was dirty. The bathroom floor had not been washed. The tub had several questionable 'hairs' in it. Used soap and shampoo in the tub. Under the bed and around it were not vacuumed, crumbs and paper bits, dirt, as well as very dirty around the perimeter of the room. I had slippers so didn't care too much. Bed, sheets and pillows were clean. The shower had horrible water pressure, mixed with a need of a new shower head that would spray any which way but straight..., it was really horrible. Hot water supply was good at night, don't know about the mornings. I would of requested a room change had we been in there longer, but for 3 days, we were fine.

There is a pizza place, and icecream shop,candy store near the south enterance. Prices again were high. Really neat walkway between Ballys and Paris, Very cool! Filled with restraunts and shops.

Well this is an understatment. We paid extra for a deluxe room, dont bother as the room looks nothing like what is shown on their website or expedias website. Room shows royal blue beddings, ottomon and chair - when walking into the room it actually looked like the bed had not been finished made. All there was was a white striped thin sheet covering a thin duvet and pillow covered in white plain pillowcases. NOT ATTRACTIVE AT ALL. Nothing close to what room was advertished as. Went to the front desk to see if maybe we had the wrong room, thought maybe this was the classic room, clerk at front desk said we received what we paid for (Deluxe room) Carpet was very dirty - bathroom was fine. Yes although Ballys is in the centre of the strip you need to walk some way to get to the stripe from the hotel. We have stayed at the Excalibur and Flamingo in the past and if I were to choose between these 3 - the Flamingo would win hands down.

Definately a non-smoking room. The view was nice as well. SERVICES The cleaning staff did a good job, but they come early. if you like to sleep in place your DND sign on the door. We did call for extra towels and blankets, they came with in 10 minutes, quick service. SLEEP QUALITY Its not a sound proof hotel, like most.

I cant function without coffee so every morning I would throw on some clothes and go to the coffee kiosk next to the reception area. The beauty of this hotel is that it is connected to Paris and you dont need to leave the hotel to have a variey of bars, restaurants, and gambling. It was raining one entire day during our stay so we did not leave the hotel. Check out the circle bar at Paris great place to people watch. We played golf at the rio secco and it was a great course but expensive. $50 cab ride to the course and $150 to play with rental clubs. Worthwhile we almost played a 2nd time.

Those nights were booked in my name and 3 nights South Tower in OH\u2019s name, $45/$40/$40. The North Tower rooms have been remodelled, but the South Tower rooms have better views. We asked for the bookings to be linked so we wouldn't have to change rooms. We were offered a Junior Suite in the South Tower for an extra $25/night and decided to take it.

Huge empty space in the middle of the floor where you could have had a dance. It was big enough to fit another 4 king size beds into. There were 2 steps up to the sunken bath and 2 built-in mirrored double closets, one at each side of the bath. His and hers sinks with lots of counter space and mirrors. The safe was in one of the closets and is charged at $3/day. Toilet in a separate room and bidet in another room. Large separate shower. Lots of toiletries at each sink and the bath. The huge floor to ceiling window was the length of the room and we had a great view of Paris, the Eiffel Tower and Paris balloon, Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, the new City Centre development and south as far as Mandalay Bay. We could also see the fountains at Bellagio. There was a light duvet on the bed and the room was quite old. The carpet was a bit stained, but the rest of the room was clean. There was wired internet access at $13.99/24 hours.

The two main differences between the Ballys standard room and the Flamingos standard room was the Flamingo had a pillow top mattress, very comfortable bed and ceiling to floor window with a nice view. The service was good and the casino was basic. Ballys Sports book was very nice. The restaraunt food was very good but service was slower that I wuold have expected.

Of course tax is added on so it amounted to $11.22/per night. We arrived via Viator/Grey LIne shuttle from the airport $12.00 round trip at 10:30am. We waited in line for a short while but then we were able to get our North Tower rooms (3) at that time. We inquired about a wheelchair for my sister for the long walk to the room but they only rented them by the day. We found out later we should have rented it right then because we ended up renting it anyway the next day for the following three days - only cost $40 for the entire time - well worth it. The next day the rest of our group arrived and they too experienced a good check in. Rooms are very large and comfy. They had tables that we used to play cards. The bath was large with very nice marble counter tops. The rooms with two double beds had a very large, comfy chair. The room with king bed had a large love seat. All room had large foot stools at foot of beds. Need to mention there are NO coffee makers, microwaves or refrigerators in any of the rooms unless you book a suite. You can get a fridge for $50 or get it free if you need it for medicine. Those of us who requested room service for the Coffee Express in the morning were very satisfied. Whenever service was requested, whether to replace a light bulb, pick up extra trash, provide extra blanket -no real blankets on beds, just nice comforters) they were there within 10-15 minutes. Slot machines were tight. Food a little pricey. We found two great finds. Tickets for shows that day are cheaper next door at Bills or other such places along the strip. Sometimes you get a voucher. Then you have to go to the actual hotel to get your ticket. These tickets cannot be exchanged for a different time. Then just down that same street along side Bills down one block (with Bally's on your right) is a wonderful Italian Rest. They have a huge sign that says they have been in business for 28 years. Can't remember the name. Carafes of red and white wine came with the meal along with a hot drink to top it off for dessert. Bally's has a wonderful spa. If you book any service, such as a massage, you have use of the spa for the day. They have exercise machines, sauna, steam room, hot tubs, lounge area. They also provide lockers, warm robes and slippers. We spend quite a bit of time there the second day. It is located in the basement area of Bally's and it was great. Bally's is connected to Paris which has nice shops and restaurants. Walk through Paris and exit outside and you cross the street to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle MIle of shops.

Our room was perfect! We booked a \"classic\" room through Orbitz and when we checked in I asked if that was a renovated room in the North tower- she said no, that the classic is a room in the South tower and then she said we could upgrade to a suite for $25 a night. That was too much for me so I told her that I read on the internet that we could upgrade to a renovated room in the North tower for $10 a night so she let us. I can not speak for the South tower but the North tower room was spacious and clean with an updated bathroom and had a great view of Paris and a side view of the fountains at Bellagio. I loved the casino- it was bright and busy as heck! The Indigo lounge at Ballys had a FABULOUS band every night! Ballys is connected to Paris so it is great to walk back and forth- Paris is super neat! This was my 5th trip to Vegas and my husband's first- we both decided if we come back that we would stay at Ballys because of the location and the price. Yes- some of the other casinos are nicer, bigger and have themes but who cares! You can walk to all of them in a matter of minutes. We visited the Planet Hollywood casino a lot and ate at the Miracle Mile Mall Shops beside it 4 times - try the Cheeseburger restaurant! DO NOT go to the \"V\" Variety Show at Planet Hollywood- it was TERRIBLE! I waited in line for over an hour at Tix4Tonight to get \"vouchers\" 1/2 off and then had to wait in line at the show to pick up the \"real\" tickets and then they said the tickets were general admission so we better show up early to get good seats- we showed up an hour before the show started and our seats were HORRIBLE- huge column in the way and we had to stack 2 seats on top of each other to see anything- I would not consider this show a Las Vegas show- not even for half price! I wouldn't go to this show for free! It was really busy when we were there- (we took a cab to old Vegas and the cabbie said that Vegas had been dead until that week) we decided to take the public transportation back to Ballys (I think it is called the Deuce) I don't recommend this either- we stopped a hundred times on the way back to let people on and off- what would have taken 10 to 15 minutes in a cab took over an hour on the bus! Ballys is great - you can not beat the location- it is central to everything! The only change I would make is more liquor in the free drinks while you are gambling.

The reason that we chose THIS hotel was BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, and it's location on the strip. Check-in was ok, we arrived around 7:30pm. The clerk at the desk offered us \"the north tower\". When we asked about \"the south tower\" -- which overlooks the strip -- we were told we'd have to wait about 3 hours. She offered us an upgrade at the cost of $25 per day. We declined. She gave us a room in the north tower with a king-sized bed instead, at no additional cost. Note that Internet access is expensive -- about $12 for 24 hours! There is no free wifi in the vicinity of this hotel. The room was quite spacious, bathroom had been upgraded with marble tiles. There were plenty of towels, complimentary soaps, shampoo, body lotion, as well as a hair dryer. The bed was comfy with 4 fluffy pillows. We overlooked Flamingo Ave, which is undergoing construction. (The construction did not bother us at all, considering they work at night.) The biggest complaint that we had was the fact that food deliveries by room service were NEVER picked up. In fact, one table with food scraps sat in the hall across from our room for 3 days. Each day, there was another table in the hall. By the end of our stay, there were 4 tables with dried-up food on them! yuk. We informed the hotel manager the evening before we left, and he said he'd look after it immediately. The next morning, ALL leftovers were still there in the hall. Regarding the casino, we only played video poker at the bar. The bartender informed us that as long as we put at least $10 in the machine, and maxxed each bet, we could drink for free. (We played video poker at plenty of other casinos with about the same winnings/losses.) The location on the strip was perfect for our needs, as it is pretty well in the middle. We could easily walk up and down the strip, and the shuttle to the Rio was a simple walk to Paris. We chose to eat breakfast at Ellis Island, which is a block away from Ballys.

Having upgraded the previous stay to a suite and being very disappointed at the cleanliness, smell and decor of the suite and not lasting a full day before moving to another room, we were very apprehensive about upgrading. However the woman who checked us in could not have been more friendly and assured us if we did not like the suite we could immediatley switch to a different room. The suite was very nice, 23rd floor with 2 different views, both facing strip hotels. The only downside was the window facing ceasars palace was very dirty and really obstructed the view. The room itself was clean and very spacious. We were both very happy with the room. The room also included a coffee maker. There was quite a bit of noise coming from street construction alongside the hotel. Luckily we both brought ear plugs otherwise it would have been a problem.

I definitely did not appreciate the overwhelming smell of smoke in the elevator first thing in the morning. I was in several other casinos that did not stink of smoke. At least the room was smoke free. However, there were ants in our room, and our tv menu did not work.

It is in a great location. All their rooms are among the most spacious on the Strip. The North Tower rooms are stylish. I even like the South Tower rooms.(I wrote a positive review in October) Yea, they are dated, but still comfortable and they offer awesome Strip views. Having said all that I was looking forward to splurging a bit and trying a Grand Suite in the North Tower. I arrived at 2:00 and was told there was a room ready. And so I was off to Room 1533. Upon opening the door of the non-smoking room I was hit with the distinctive smell of stale smoke. I walked in with optimism and hopes for a really neat room. All of that faded in about 20 seconds. The vase full of plastic lilies by the door should have been the first clue. Although in the North Tower, it seems this suite was never touched when they renovated that tower. The non-descript furniture was a mismatch of different pieces. There was a reasonably comfortable love seat, a coffee table from the Reagan administration, and then why not throw in a wicker chair for the heck of it. The bed was okay at best. Certainly not the kind of luxury mattresses that many places have today. The \u201cpopcorn\u201d ceiling was in good shape considering it was probably there since the fire. Certainly not what I was looking for in a suite. The suite is only marginally bigger than a standard room. The dimensions are wider, but not as deep. Some of the space is lost to an entrance hallway. The one positive thing about the room was the slightly raised Jacuzzi tub adjacent to the bed. This is why I booked this suite. It was the centerpiece of the room. Even that was a disappointment as the power switch malfunctioned, it kept shutting off while using and the button had to be pushed repeatedly. A dimmer switch on the lighting would have made for a nicer setting, but no such luck. It was definitely a winter day when we were there. The thermostat had to be raised to 80 degrees before the room started to warm up. The blower was ridiculously loud. It continually made its presence known as it cycled on and off through the night. When the heat was not making noise the toilet did. About every 10 minutes that kicked in to refill a tank that would not remain full. All of this \u201cluxury\u201d cost $179 for the night. This was for midweek in December when that kind of money would buy a lot more in many places on the Strip. By 7:00 in the morning I was at the front desk asking to check out. Happily they did not hold me to the rest of my reservation. They did not ask any questions nor did they seem at all interested about my issues with the room. A few hours later I was sitting in an awesome suite on the 36th floor of The Hotel for $40 less a night. Standard rooms at Bally\u2019s have a lot going for them and are a great value.

The drink service in the casino was great, even when playing the low money slots. I was a little disappointed in the sports book, a few others we went into were much more comfortable. If you're betting sports, you only get free drinks with a $100 minimum bet. However, you get free drinks if you're betting anything on the races. You do the math.... I agree with the reviewer who mentioned Ellis Island, a small casino/restaurant about a 5 minute walk behind Bally's.....might be the best deal going. A $6.95 steak dinner, ( and it was good!) and it includes a 16 ounce beer .

It was pretty obvious we were there during the recession. Half of the tables in Paris & Bally's weren't being used. A couple nights we had a hard time finding a table. We never played cards at Paris because the $10 tables were always full. Dealers at Bally's were mostly fun. They kept us entertained and were always helpful. Bally's is in a very convenient location.

We stayed at Bally's all 4 nites. We'd both read the reviews for Bally's on here and the negative ones, like other reviewers have said, caused us to worry just a little about what we were going to get. Our worries were totally without merit. Our stay was awesome. Bally's, as I've rated, was excellent in every respect. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We stayed in the North Tower because there was nothing available in the South. The SEMA convention was going on that week, so we got a room in the North Tower at no extra charge (usually $20/nite as I've read). I don't understand the fiercely negative reviews on here about Bally's. I suppose Bally's could have had an off day. I rather tend to believe that those particular travelers are just the impossible to please type, know what I mean? Here's the basics: My wife and I prize cleanliness over ALL else. We were not disappointed. The room was spotless every day. New towels and bedding everyday -- a daily $5 tip probably helped. Our room and the whole hotel did seem a bit dated. The color scheme is generally of a gold color, but everything was very clean. The furnishings were just fine and the bathroom, with marble all around, was very nice. I've read a few reviews about low water pressure. We had absolutely no problem. Pressure was excellent, showerhead had good volume and the water could be as hot as you could stand it. The water was rather hard. So, if you're used to soft water like us you've been warned. We stayed on the 12th floor facing Planet Hollywood and the Paris hotel. Not a whole lot to see but the view was still nice. It was also the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in. Not gigantic but definitely bigger than average. Bally's has a monorail station connected to the hotel. I highly recommend using this. Bally's is definitely in an ideal location. However, the other hotels are farther away than they look. We walked a lot, but for repeat visits to other casinos, we used the monorail. We got a massage in Bally's spa. It was $80 for 50 min., it was nice but overpriced to me. Again, the staff at the spa was outstanding. The casino did, of course, smell of cigarette smoke. ALL of the casinos do because they allow smoking in them. They all seem to have their own individual fragrance when you first walk in. Maybe in an effort to mask the smoke smell. It was so noticeable to us because we're non-smokers, but it wasn't terrible. We ate only two meals at Bally's. A quick bite at Sbarro's and a lunch, a burger, at a restaurant not listed on their site. I forget the name but I think it begins with a \"T\". The burger was excellent but a bit pricey... like EVERYTHING in Vegas. We also ate a breakfast and a dinner at Terrible's Casino, about 2 long blocks from Bally's. Good food, good price, again, long walk. Check-in and out was relatively quick. I don't think it matters when you come or go, there will be some sort of a line. We didn't do the quick-checkout because we wanted to see the charges on our bill. They were perfectly correct. (We bought a vacation package... the only charges were for our massages). One other thing: The shuttle from the airport was miserable. The driver took \"back\" roads and it took at least 20 min. to get to Bally's. We didn't want to risk being late for our flight home so we took a cab to the airport. This I highly recommend. The only real downside I would mention is how much you have to walk. Big hotels/casinos are neat, but... they're BIG! As far as eating, my wife and I highly recommend the buffet at Excalibur. They have an all-you-can-eat, all day for $29.00. You can't beat that anywhere. Plus, the variety of their buffet is superb. American food and a good size Chinese section and a Mexican section. We ate one breakfast at MGM's Grand Buffet. Don't waste your time. It was $16/person and the variety was very limited. My final recommendations: Stay at Bally's for the location and price. We used our hotel room to clean up and sleep. Otherwise, we weren't there. If you want to pay double, triple or more for a room at the Bellagio, Venitian or where ever, that's certainly your choice, but we were extremely satisfied with everything Bally's had to offer and didn't pay an outrageous price. It really depends on what you want and what you value. Next, you have to tip darn near everyone, shuttle bus drivers, cab drivers, doormen, waiters, dealers (if you play or win much... which we didn't). So budget generously for tipping. You can find guides on tipping in Vegas. We followed what the guides said. Waitstaff were tipped as we do anywhere else. Good service got a good tip. Food in Vegas isn't used as a tool to get you into the casino. They make a profit off of it... translation: it's expensive so be prepared. Last, have a great time. Explore everywhere you can. There's a lot to see. P.S. We went through the Luxor. We were not impressed at all. In fact, the \"clientle\" walking around was much better dressed than any other hotel we were in. The atmosphere at the Luxor was very uppity, snooty and snobish. It was the ONLY hotel where we saw a sign saying \"No Photos\" inside and with a \"Proper Attire Required\" sign on one restaurant.

The room was on the 25th floor with a nice view of the North Strip (Harrah's, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn..). The room was huge, beautiful, clean & comfortable. The halls were quiet so no problems sleeping. I found the staff friendly, the slots looser than the MGM properties, but not as good as the Las Vegas Hilton or downtown. The drink service is not so great, but I found this to be true everywhere on the Strip compared to other visits. Other CONS included: no hair conditioner, no coffee maker in the room (expected), no Starbucks, only one coffee bar in the hotel (long lines in the morning), $25 for a 6 cup pot of coffee via room service with delivery charge plus tip, and a $3 charge per day for the safe. We only ate at a bar in the passage between Bally's & Paris for a quick burger which was fine.

Check-in person wasn't very friendly, and I only managed to get the least amount of conversation out of her that was required to check us in. I had requested and paid for a North Tower non smoking room , with preference of a room facing the strip, all that was available she advised me was a smoking room for that night and I could move the next day , fine, We were tired so took it. When we got to the room it was disgusting, the smell hit you coming out of the lifts that it was a smoking floor, and only got worse as we entered the room. I have stayed in smoking rooms before but this room was like nothing else, the curtains where brown, even my friend staying with me, who is a smoker said she couldn't stay in it, and it overlooked a car parking lot to top it ! Back down to reception , there was no way I was paying to stay in a room like that . A different reception person who was just so lovely, she fully understood and searched the system, finding us a non smoking room in the north tower in minutes ? , apologising that it was only on the 12th floor and not higher . This room was perfect , a view across to Ceasars , and the room was spotless.

Since I\u2019ve never been to Las Vegas before, I decided to depart home early and take my wife, a travel agent, to spend a few extra days touring Las Vegas, visiting with my sister from LA and seeing the Hoover Dam, all of which were very nice. My wife and I stayed at the Bellagio hotel / casino a few nights before the convention started at Bally\u2019s and our experience was very enjoyable; the fountain was impressive too! The day before the convention, we moved to Bally\u2019s since the hotel room was included as part of the convention\u2019s registration fee. My expectations of Bally\u2019s were lower than the Bellagio because it\u2019s an older less expensive hotel. Despite my lower expectations, Bally\u2019s still succeeded in disappointing us. We arrived at Bally\u2019s around 2 PM and I was surprised to see the long check-in line. I asked the hotel check-in line attendant if they were going to bring additional staff to help speed up the check-in process since there were six (6) empty hotel check-in attendant stations, and she said the empty stations would be staffed in about 5 minutes. I thought she was serious and was very relieved. As it turned out, she was just joking; the joke being on me and the other folks waiting in line. Thirty minutes later we were heading to our room on the 23rd floor, room 2311 to be specific. During check-in, the attendant stated that the daily $13.99 Internet fee and spa exercise room were included (free) for conference attendees. Not being a gambler, smoker (former) or heavy drinker, I was immediately overcome by the significant amount of cigarette / cigar / pipe smoke in Bally\u2019s casino\u2026 my sinus\u2019s clogged up almost immediately and stayed congested during our entire stay despite my best efforts to get relief from nasal spray. I don\u2019t know how one can avoid all the smoke filled air in the Vegas casinos, probably not, but some casinos are definitely much worse than others. Our room was large, clean, and had basic, though somewhat dated, furnishings and accouterments; it was about what I expected. The view out over Vegas from our room was pleasant, looking north over Flamingo Road. What we didn\u2019t know at the time, was that Flamingo Road appears to be a primary route for emergency vehicles and the room had very poor noise insulating characteristic due to the large single pane exterior glass doors and windows. That evening we were awoken several times by road maintenance jack hammers, emergency vehicles and even by people\u2019s voices on the street 23 floors below us. The next morning I contacted the front desk concerning the noise and they stated they would put be us a waiting list for a room change, but couldn\u2019t guarantee the move\u2026 Two noisy sleepless nights later, we decided to check-out early and depart the conference and head back home. On check-out, we were advised, to my surprise, that the Internet charges and exercise fees were not included in my conference fee as I was told at check-in. Since I needed to catch a flight I didn\u2019t have time to ask for a manager, or argue with the attendant, I asked for an address to write the hotel management. I\u2019m not confident I\u2019ll receive a reply, however; especially since I didn't deposit thousands of $$ in their casino gambling. Summary If you\u2019re a gambler, smoker and like to drink, you\u2019ll just love this hotel, especially if you\u2019re tied to a budget. I did find the prices for food and beverages in Las Vegas to be on the very high side along the strip; and I live in a high cost of living area \u2013 Washington, DC. If you decide to stay at Bally\u2019s, be sure to request a room on the south side, away from Flamingo Road, otherwise bring some heavy duty ear plugs (or get totally drunk) if you plan to sleep comfortably at night.

On previous trips we have stayed at the Flamingo and Bill's Gambling Hall and even tho we had read some rather bad reviews about Bally's we decided to give it a try. Check in took maybe 15 minutes and the desk clerk was as nice as could be. She did ask if we wanted to upgrade our South Tower room and we said no. We had reserved a king non-smoking room and there weren't any available at that time but she found us a non-smoking room with 2 queen beds and that was fine with us. The elevator to the South Tower is right off the casino floor (not far from the main hotel entrance) and our room was about halfway down the hall after exiting the elevator. We opened the door and I was delighted. The room was the largest we had ever had and the bathroom arrangement was great. The room was neat and clean and didn't smell bad. We had a great view of Bill's Gambling Hall and the strip. Yes, the windows weren't as clean as they could be but we didn't come to Vegas to stand and stare out of them. Water pressure in the shower could have blown you out of the tub and we had shower doors and not a shower curtain. Location of Bally's is just the best you can ask for. You can walk out to the front of the hotel and sit and watch the fountains at Bellagio, take the elevated crosswalks to Ceasars, Bill's etc. The connection to the Paris is an added plus for shopping or dining. There are some cheaper places to eat at Bally's downstairs and also some shops. All in all you couldn't ask for a better location.

Of course the central location is the best advantage for the hotel which has been around a few years now, but it seems to be well maintained to my eyes. We got a $40 a night rate in the south tower which really can't be beat for the strip(ouside of the IPee). We arrived at 9:00 pm on a Sunday night and were told that there was no non-smoking rooms available and asked if we wanted a smoking room instead. No thanks. Well she said we can put you up in a suite for tonight. Uh...okay. If we liked it we could pay an extra $50 a night and stay there. The suite(in the north tower on the 15th floor) included a jacuzzi tub and his and her sinks and a bidet! It also faced the strip but really between the south tower and Paris next door the strip view was limited. The room was nice for the night but we couldn't justify paying extra for the next 4 nights. The next afternoon we were moved down the hall on the same floor to a standard room facing north. I guess considering we were booked for the south tower this was considered a free upgrade so that was ok. Having stayed in south tower rooms on previous trips these rooms are a little better but if you really want a strip view stay in the south tower. Beds were a little hard i thought, even in the suite but the rooms themselves are quite large compared to pricier rooms on the strip i've stayed in. Housekeeping was consistent and our room was always cleaned when we returned later in the day. There doesn't seem to be any outstanding restaurant at Ballys so we didn't eat there much except for coffe/muffins and fast food. The coffee shop is NOT 24 hours unlike most in the strip hotels. The moving sidewalks out front were hit and miss as far as working and the time share people out front didn't seem to be as annoying as usual. VP here as in most Harrahs properties is generally terrible so go elsewhere for that. Don't know much about table games since i play VP exclusively. Paris next door has a generally nicer casino to me. All in all I can recommend Ballys for the good rates and location. Don't expect fancy of course.

For an affordable getaway or extended stay (my case) this place is great. The location was perfect and the service solidly professional, but the facility is undoubtedly dated and it shows. Good value for the money I spent., but NO microwave. Amenities: Fridge (depends on room), coffee maker, iron, ironing board, safe, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. I would stay again. Purpose of stay: multiple week business trip. PARKING: Very accessible, especially when you get familiar with all the different entrances/exits. However, parking is a long way from the front desk. So don\u2019t overload yourself if you\u2019re just checking in. Grab what you need and come back for the rest later because it\u2019s a hike. ROOM: The room was 3.5-4 stars in my book. It was definitely spacious with a sofa, a round table for four, a bar area with a small refrigerator, a small single basin sink, counter space where the ice bucket, glasses, and coffee maker sat. There was also some storage space beneath the sink for dry goods. The bed was spacious (can\u2019t remember if it was a king or queen) and comfortable after a long day of work, but it was a Murphy bed; the type that can be pushed/folded up into the wall. Opposite the bed was a hutch with a medium size tv and clothes drawers. Next to it was a work desk. The bathroom was also spacious with a lot of room to move around for one person. The small hall leading to the bathroom had a double closet with sliding mirrored doors on one side. Inside was the safe, iron, and ironing board. On the other side that was a vanity area with a counter, lamp and large mirror. Room cons: 1) No microwave. 2) Regarding the bed: because a Murphy bed sits on a platform, I constantly stubbed my toes and hit my ankles on it which was very annoying. 3) Regarding being attached to two other rooms: well, I had doors leading to them. Therefore when neighbors were present I could hear their conversations as well as whatever else they were doing \u2013 esp. after midnight (wink, wink). ENTERTAINMENT: There was a variety of evening entertainment available because Ballys and Paris casinos are co-located. The transition area between the two hotels features a piano bar, restaurants, and shops. In the Ballys casino area there is a small music venue that has a band every nite - definitely a decent place to unwind and meet new people. POOL: Located at the lowest level. Pool was a plus. Expansive; it was a great social gathering area particularly on the weekend when DJs were mixing music with contests, etc. The only detracting thing was when show promoters came walking through pushing tickets and show times. FITNESS/SPA: Located at the lowest level. So so. I\u2019m a weight lifter who likes his cardio. The spa is located in the lower level and costs $ (I paid $26 per visit which entitles you to use the gym and spa assets, but not treatments. You are able to go in/out all day for your fee). They opened at 6:30 am (which was too late for me) and they stayed open until 7pm. My best value was the weekends when I could get in an early workout, come back in the afternoon for a later workout then come back in after a day at the pool and take in a sauna, sit in a hot or cold tub (there are 3 \u2013 warm, hot, ice cold) and then indulge in using their shaving and toiletries accessories to get ready for dinner. This included complimentary use of bath robe, slippers and towels as well as free beverages and fruit. The staff was very friendly and attentive. FOOD: Located at the lowest level. A number of eateries. There was Sbarro Italian food (chain store) in a cafeteria line format offering anything from pizza to main courses. Nathan\u2019s Hot Dogs was there (chain store) also. There is also an excellent little non chain Japanese restaurant named Ichiban offering sushi and main dishes that are reasonably priced given the location (good value for your money). There are also a few candy and ice cream stores/kiosks as well as numerous tourist shops as well. SERVICE: Five stars. All the staff was courteous, helpful, professional, and friendly. I do not recommend using the quick check out. Although you can view your bill on the TV I still had some issues that took some time to get resolved once I got home to file my business expenses. If you book online, make sure you are charged your online booking fee only once.

Also I recommend the crepe stand between Bally's and Paris, with every order your receipt has an offer for $5 off the dinner buffet (which is right across from the crepe stand) for upto 4 people, so as much as $20 off for buying a $10 crepe, that's a good deal and the crepes are great too!

Still its nothing fancy but the rooms (in the North tower) are on par with a Hilton property. North Tower rooms also tend to have better views of the strip. One positive of Bally's is on the shuttles from the Las Vegas Airport they tend to be one of the first stops in that zone, and one of the last places to get picked up because their a bit closer to the airport, so there's not as much waiting involved on the bus and such. Check in lines can be long so be prepared for that, but other than that this is a good spot - location can't be beat across from Bellagio, and while Bally's doesn't have a buffet they give you coupons that can be used at Harrah's, Flamingo (both have excellent buffets), or Imperial Palace (cheap and not so good). Paris is also next door and their buffet is fancy.

The cons were don't take the room upgrade unless you plan to pay for it. They have the Total Rewards Card, which we used every time we ate, gambled etc. all 5 days and received a grand total of 16.20 rewards at the end, should be called Total Waste of Time instead of Total Rewards. Food all over Vegas is ridiculously overpriced, including Ballys. The room upgrade which we took was great. The room was cleaned every day, no problems at all with towels etc. The room safe worked great, no problems there either. The staff all over Ballys was great. The pool was great, service there for drinks was too. We were not told at check in that our debit card was going to be charged $100 per day for every day of the trip. We had a 4 day trip, so they charged our debit card $400 at check in and were not told that. When I found out about it the day before we left and asked them about it, I was told they did it because we had 'charging privledges' at the hotel. We were on the 25th floor and never waited more than 1 minute for an elevator. The employees in the Keno room were superior, as well as Debbie who was the cocktail waitress at the pool. They let us check in at 10am. We had looked at the Luxor, and New York New York also, same price range as Ballys. However it was trashy down there, a lot of construction going on. We were glad we didn't stay there. The food at the deli was great, but again overpriced. We ordered room service breakfast every day, was there within 20 minutes. Continental breakfast (plate of danish, large juice, pot of coffee) side orders of hash browns and sausage cost $25, plus $5 tip, $30 for breakfast every day. Sbarro downstairs was extremely overpriced, plate of spaghetti and cheese ravioli, 2 pops was $30. The sports book was closed for remodeling which we were never told prior to booking, of course it was reopening the day after we left. No total reward there, just a total inconvenience. The lady at check in gave us the impression that if we used our rewards card we would be comped for the room upgrade which didn't happen. I complained about it and they did comp 2 nites of room upgrades(22.40 per nite) which I thought was fair.

The little sandwich shop by the South Tower elevators is really good. The best part is that Bally's is connected to Paris by a shopping mall. That gives you two casinos for the price of one and a bunch of additional restaurants. Burgers Brassiere (or whatever) is really good and so is the dessert place.

The noise from all the machines was very loud, and I found it to be really very smoky - who thought Scotland would have been so healthy in comparison??!!!! Ballys left us helpful information sheets each morning, warning of construction work, advising us of ways to check out quickly and offering half price tickets for Jubilee, which we went to see, albeit the early show because we had a 17 year old in tow. I loved it, maybe because I'm a sucker for old style all singing all dancing shows! All acts were fab, it's quite a spectacle. Pool is quite a walk away, but worth it once you get there. However, tennis courts are NOT worth it - $20 to hire court, $10 for each racquet...I don't know how much for tennis balls, because I stopped listening!

We were there for a week. We stayed in a deluxe room. I was really worried about it because of the reviews I previously read about it, but it was just about perfect for us. The room is very spacious. Housekeeping was on point. They came to clean at different times everyday. Somehow housekeeping knew when we would leave our room. Even if it was for a short period of time they would come in and clean quickly. I still haven't figured it out. I suspect that cameras were in the room or hallways, because otherwise how would they know we were not in. The rooms were cleaned very well. It would have been great if the rooms had microwaves or refrigerators because the food in Vegas is very EXPENSIVE. If you buy a single bottle of water or soda it is going to cost you over $3 at the hotel. When traveling it is best to travel by The Deuce. It is a city bus that can take you where ever you need to go. You can get a pass for 24hours for only $7. That is great being that a cab will cost you double that price or more depending on where you are going. Catch The Deuce to target which is similar to a super Walmart. You can buy things there that are much cheaper than what the hotel will charge you. Ballys is in a great location. My only complaint is that the check-in time was VERY long. They only had two people at the front desk checking people in. It was really bad. When I toured some of the other hotels their check in process was MUCH quicker. Be careful in Vegas people will try to get your money any way they can. They will lie to you and tell you one thing, but when you get there it is totally not what they said. Most of all have fun.

Our main concern was a hotel with a fun pool atmosphere (we spent everyday at the pool and didn't hit the strip till dark), a central location and not \"over the top\" in terms of frills and cost. Ballys was GREAT! Stayed here 8 years ago and loved it then. At check in I mentioned that it was my friend's b'day and the clerk upgraded us from the South Tower to the North Tower. Rooms were large, clean with comfy beds and great airconditioning. The only changes I noticed from the last stay was that there is a daily charge for a refrigerator and use of the in room safe. The location is center strip and close to everything. You can hop on a shuttle at Paris (connected to Bally's) that will take you to the Rio and from there you can take another shuttle to Freemont. (alot of fun!!) The pool is nothing fancy but large with a deep end. A D.J. plays music everyday. If you want a pool where things are fairly loud and can get a bit \"rowdy\" ie, LOTS of drinking and encouragement of the sport goes on here...then don't stay at Bally's. We loved the activity...the waitresses were friendly, the people were friendly and there was always something going on, ie, hoola hoop competitions etc. Only negatives are the prices of items in the small market located near the lobby ($3.00 for a small bottle of water). Go to the market located 1 block behind the strip between Bally's and Gamblin Bills....good prices there...and it is a bit of a walk thru the small mall to get to the pool but you can stop and crap some fairly inexpensive fast food along the way.

Our windows were absolutely filthy and we didn't even open our curtains the entire stay because of them.

With money in hand, husband stood there for 20 minutes with the bartenders walking past him numerous times without even looking our way. Even after a polite \"excuse me sir\", we got a glance and they walked away to continue to unload a dishwasher behind the bar. Needless to say, we did not visit that bar again. Ordered room service one night and service was average (about 30 minutes) and food was mediocre. We never made it to the pool but after seeing other posters pictures I don't think we missed much. There is only 1 restaurant that was completely full and after looking over the menu posted we decided to skip this one because we never say anyone seated receiving any service from the staff (actually, never saw a waiter/waitress in 10 minutes we stood there).

Why hang around Bally's because they are slow? Which is proably what they want you to do! Got into our king ST around 10 pm. The bad reviews you read here about ST are true. Carpet in hallways dirty, stained, dark, trashy, and smelled. The room wasn't any better. Cigarette burns on mattress and floor. Bedding was ragged.The bed was the worst ever. Wallpaper was peeling off walls. You could hear your neighbors on both sides. I heard the toilet paper rolling next door - while in our bathroom. When you showered,half the water came out the shower head and half out tub fawcett. We were ready to upgrade that night, but the line was long as usual. So we stayed one night in ST. The next morning we got up and moved to NT. There is no line early in the morning. It now cost us $20 a night to move to king in NT. Which is well worth the extra money. The hallways were wide, clean, bright, no trash, well mainted, etc. Even saw people cleaning carpet, windows, dusting, etc. The room so much nicer, too.

The ST room was # 5822 And the NT room # was 2441.It is hard to believe the difference in the two towers at Bally's. It ending up costing a little over $1.50 a night for the better room. The casino host made us pay $ 6 & change because we didn't loose much money at Bally's. They don't consider time played! We played more at Paris next door which is nicer. And down the strip at O'Shays, Imperial Palance (check out the dealtainers, from 12 pm on), and Harrahs. All Harrahs Properties! There is a lot of road and hotel construction going on. A rental car is waste of money, unless you want to travel outside of Las Vegas. It is very hard to navigate the strip now. Traffic cones, lanes closed, detours, rude/ drunk drivers, buses, limos, concrete trucks, and lost tourists. I almost forgot about the police cars, ambulances, and the worst - taxis. Our Ford Focus took 2 gallons of gas to fill tank. Don't let the rental car people talk you into buying their full tank of gas at a cheaper rate, unless you plan on using it all up. Paris was giving out 20% off coupons to their Village Buffet good Mon. thru Fri., to players at the table games. We ate there twice. Very good! It is located inside, between them and Bally's. There is usually a line, but it moves fairly fast. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night buffets. A lot of choices and your beverages. The $25 all day buffet at Excaliber was not that good. And if you get the steak and eggs special anywhere, the steak needs to be cooked medium. Other wise the small steaks are tuff to chew. The good ratings at the top are for the Bally's North Tower.

What let down my experience at Ballys though was the extremely poor service I received, particuarly from front desk staff. It didn't start off well when the check in line was over an hour long. This really was unacceptable and by far the worst I had anywhere in the States. It also seems this was not a one off as I observed similar lines for check in every evening. This is not how a hotel should welcome their guests. My advice if you do chose to stay here is don't arrive past 7pm as you will likely get a long check in line. This was then compounded by an astounding lack of care by three check in staff over the next few hours in resolving what ultimately turned out to be a booking error caused by them in regard to my booking (which they claimed had been cancelled only to discover that their system had caused the problem). During this time, absolutely no assistance was given and I was treated extremely rudely by all staff members. Furthermore, when the matter was resolved, no apology was given and neither was there any offers of compensation or upgrade. Further dealings with front desk staff were also not positive as they showed continuous disregard for service or trying to positively assist their guests.

My room was in the South Tower, which I was a little leary about after reading other reviews. I have forgotten my room number but I think it was 6529. Anyway, our room had a magnificent view of the Eifel Tower and I was even able to see the fountains at Bellagio. I did not find that there was any excessive street noise or otherwise. It was a bit of a hike to the elevator but I was OK with that. The room itself was clean, clean, clean! That is number 1 on my list. Yes, it is true, the furniture is a bit outdated and scratched.....but who cares? I don't have to live with it. It's just a place to sleep and keep my stuff while I'm out enjoying myself. I'm sure the sheets were brand new. They were white and crisp. The bathroom was also very clean. I learned a tipping trick when I went to Disney. Rather than wait till the end of my stay to tip, I leave an envelope with $2.00 everyday for the room keeper. One morning my boyfriend had to go back to the room for something and our room keeper was there and she just went on and on about how nice I was to leave her a little card with her tip everyday. Who knows, this may have insured a little extra attention to our room. (I always had plenty of towels.) Check-in was a bit of a line but it went smoothly and timely. While in line there were associates passing us bottled water. No one was rude or out of line. Check out was easy too. I was told I had a phone charge on my bill and I calmly said, \"I did not use the phone at all.\" She was very polite and said, \"No problem, I'll remove that from your bill.\" That was it. Also, you can't beat the location. My whole experience was positive. In fact, I'm returning to Vegas in late September and have already booked Bally's for my stay.

Checking in - dreadful! it took over an hour ......to check in , although, the front desk clerk Arlene was awesome! She really hooked it up for us. She was so accommodating - i felt great being there! Great PR~ My husband and i checked in a day earlier than the rest of our party. .. So, I guess we got real \"Lucky\". We were upgrade to a suite with no additional charge. ( WOW ) because they did not have a room available at the time of our check in - we were pretty late in checking in.....it was about 9:00p.m . ...no rooms available - we got a suite , cool! we actually booked for an extra night for small affordable fee....wow! - now we where even more happier than before, staying an extra night in a suite! yahoo!....We got a deal of the year - i love it......we loved it....Thanks Arlene!!!!!!!!! Now- this year was my turn to do the reservations and book the rooms for our yearly trip.

Next day my family arrives about 6:00p.m - 2 hours after check in......the occupants for the 3 other rooms are being served by one clerk in order to check them all in at once. well, guess what - there are no rooms available! the male clerk told us that they had 3 rooms that would be available in about 2-4 hours........( let's do the math : it apprx 6 pm , 2-4 will be close to 8 or 10:00p.m ) hmmmm? is this acceptable ? well, it is to them . Then they informed us that each room would be on different floors . WHAT!!!!!!!!!! I explained to them that i booked together in order to have our rooms at least on the same floor. They told me that the preference of the rooms were not guaranteed. so if i booked a queen non smoking 3 months in advance - it wouldn't matter because it's based on availability......ain't that a biscuit! Now i asked to speak to the manger, he was worse. The manager said that based on availability nothing is guaranteed. i asked him if he could give them something else, kings if available , the manager said for 20.00 more a night - he would upgrade them , but not for free. the Manager would not budge , accommodate or upgrade for free - even if they didn't have their rooms ready. he knew we wouln't go to another hotel because one of us was already staying there and we all wanted to be in the same hotel. The told us : if we wanted the 3 rooms , (1) we would have to wait 2-4 hours, (2) they would be on different floors (3)refund . ...............Now doesn't that sound awful- refund ..? where in the heck are we going to find a descent room on the same night we are trying to check in on with the rates we paid....! ! ! what monsters! By now my family is so tired, already stressing out, staring at me - shaking their head ........My brother said they would wait........but were not going to pay 20.00 extra to upgrade..............( 20 x 2 nights= 40 per room x3 = 120 ) no way................... Once the rooms were finally ready - OMGosh! they should of paid to upgrade. The rooms in the south tower are ugly, smelly and gloomy! I felt horrible that my family was in that tower. Everything is old! The carpet was worn out , the bed are hard everything was just awful and very outdated. I would never , ever stay in the south tower!!!!!!!!! however i would stay in the north tower - anytime. Moral ? catch 22 ?

I would not have been able to afford such a trip if I had to pay $100+ per night for the hotel alone, with all of the shows, gambling and drinking that we had planned. The great rates and excellent location of Bally's helped make my trip a great one. Just make sure that you understand what Bally's offers. It is NOT a flashy hotel by any means. It actually looks pretty nice on the outside, with the cool violet colors and lit up rings encircling the walkways and escalators moving you up to the hotel from the strip. But on the inside, it has more of an outdated and budget feel. The casino and lobby area are definitely among the least impressive on the strip. There is a rather large \"mall\" below the lobby area, which you must take escalators down to (with the pool at the end of the mall). There are a few nice shops and restaurants, but it's nothing compared to the shops you'll see in Paris, Caesar's, Bellagio, etc. One major plus is that the hotel is connected to Paris, so you can easily walk to and from Paris through the indoor mall there, leading up to the casino of Paris. You almost feel like you're a part of the Paris hotel in this way. There is also convenient shuttle service to and from Rio/Palms. two nice hotels/casinos located pretty far from the strip (would be a long, boring walk otherwise). These shuttles are located just outside Paris, where all the cabs are. The rooms in Bally's are not anything special, but ours were pretty clean and large. We have heard that Bally's has among the largest rooms on the strip, which is a definite plus. You don't feel squeezed and cramped, and the views we had were very nice (facing north). Overall, if you're looking for a decent hotel at a great price and location, you should definitely consider Bally's. The other Harrah's hotels are pretty similar, in that they offer great locations and prices with older hotels that don't have the glitz and glamour of some of the newer, more luxurious ones. But in my opinion, you can experience all of that anyway since you're free to go into all of the casinos anyway. I go to Vegas to enjoy all of the entertainment and to explore all of the great sites. Not to sit around in a luxurious hotel. I would gladly pocket the extra $100+ a night and spend it on show tickets, blackjack tables, or nice dinners.

We had a room with double beds and the first night we slept in the bed near the window so I could see the view and watch the fountains. But we smelled bengay or menthol in the sheets. We were so exhausted from our trip we just blew it off thinking it was possibly the soap they used to wash the sheets. The second night, we smelled the menthol again.

Lovely carpet, furniture, a 1/2 loveseat, desk w/2 chairs, separate vanity area and granite bath. It really only had a wet bar with a fridge, but that was helpful in keeping our left overs and snacks. At check out we were not charged the $25 upgrade to the suite, nor the $3 for use of the safe. Not sure why but didn't ask. Parking was convenient and so was the location and being next to Paris was great with all the lovely restaurants. Maids seems to be in the hallway all day long either chatting or cleaning and did see room service carts in the halls for quite a long time. Pool was full of shall we say mature guests. Food at Nosh was great. Seemed the escalators and people movers were out quite a lot in the Bally's area. They always seems to be running in the Ceasars, Bellagio and Wynn casino cross overs. Also Bally's could use a good power washing of its side walk areas I think.

The manager called \"LARRY\" came and made us feel that it was our fault he said, \"...we had NOTHING available...\" even though the kid who was helping us first said that if we wanted to stay we had to pay $219.00 per night. Of course that's the price for a \"high end\" suite, the helpful manager wouldn't want us to stay in a expensive suite but please, don't say there is nothing available. One hour later and without receiving any help at all (The manager didn't call another hotel) we grabbed our bags and started walking towards the Monte Carlo. Next day we went back to Bally's since the night was booked for that day, 30 minutes in line and the agent gave us a room saying, \"This is one of the best room we have...\", I was already excited !, The room was spacious, the furniture was worned out and some of the outlets didn't work, whatever, I decided to take a bath and after seeing a handful of black hair coming out of the drain i changed my mind..., I quickly saw a brown strip inside the bath, I decided to scrap it with my fingers it to see what it was, BIG MISTAKE, it was rest of soap, dirt and who knows what else. 3:00 am in the morning, we went to bed, I know is early but we were way to tired, 3:45 pm a very noisy alarm wake us up, \"May I have your attention please, the source of the alarm hasn't been identify yet, please remain calm\", they repeated this tape around 30 times, there was nothing I could do to cover my ears against such a loud alarm. The alarm stopped finally, 5 minutes after, AGAIN !!!, \"May I have your attention please, the source of the alarm has been identified, this is not an emergency, I repeat, this is not an emergency\" lol, I was going insane there... Next morning, yay ! I didn't know I was going to be so happy to leave Las Vegas, Check out lane, FORGET IT, I'll try express check out, In the room they have a express check out card, just put your name and room number with the keys and drop it at front desk... easy !. The longest line I have seen since I got to Las Vegas, Why should I wait to do a express check out, I decided politely ask one of the front desk people where should I drop my card. At less than 3 ft away from one of the agents who was writing something on the computer while with a customer, I said, \"I'm sorry, excuse me, may I ask you a quick question\", ...nothing...., ummm, I tried again, the customer smiled at me and he said to the lady, \"Excuse me she needs your help...\", she looked at me, I said \"Oh hi, sorry I just have a quick question...\" I couldn't even keep talking when she looked at the customer and said, \"No... It's ok...\" and kept typing, BOOMER !, thank god the customer noticed that and looked at me like... what the heck...., anyhow, I was expecting something like that....

We found an online \"buy three nights, get one free\" deal at Bally's with an average cost-per-night of just under $100, which seemed fantastic, as I couldn't find another centrally-located hotel on the Strip for the same dates at under $150/night. After reading some of the reviews here, we went into our stay with relatively low expectations, hoping for a great location but just an adequate, clean room in which we didn't plan to spend much time. When we arrived it was clear that Bally's wasn't going to be the highest-end hotel in town, as the look of the casino and check-in area are somewhat dated, but it wasn't awful - just a little blah. Pretty much what we expected. We had to wait maybe 15 minutes to check in, but we were greeted by a very friendly and competent young man, and when we asked if any upgrades were available, he immediately placed us in a North Tower room at no additional charge. Our room was far better than we'd anticipated. It had obviously been completely updated within the past few years (stylish carpet & wallpapers, granite countertops, etc), and was extremely spacious, with a separate vanity and sink outside the main bathroom. The bed turned out to be super-comfortable, too. Our room was always cleaned while we were out having breakfast (not sure how the maids timed it just right every day, but they did), and I don't recall seeing any dirty trays in the hallways or other items that were neglected in terms of cleanliness. The casino at Bally's is small and definitely not as upscale as many other Strip casinos, but the location of the hotel is perfect. We were able to walk to most of the other \"name\" hotels on the Strip within 10 minutes or so, and if we wanted a more close-by upscale environment, we walked to Paris, which is connected to Bally's by a walkway of shops and restaurants. On our last day, we weren't scheduled to fly out until 11:30pm, so we asked for a late check-out. We were told we could delay our check-out from 11am to 1pm at no charge, or to 4pm for an additional $25 (which didn't seem too bad given the additional time it would buy us). We later asked again if there was any way we could instead check out at 9pm, and that request was granted at no additional charge. That gave us a full extra day to enjoy Vegas before we had to think about leaving, which I thought was great. We did have a few complaints: Bally's \"Total Rewards\" program pretty much blows (we spent around $1500, total, between the room, food & drink, and gambling at Bally's affiliated casinos - including some table games, not just slots - and literally wound up with $0.86 in comps. That's eighty-six CENTS. I mean, I wasn't expecting a free room night, but seriously?!?) We also wanted to work out one day, but the gym is part of the \"spa,\" which Bally's charges its guests $22/day, per person, to access. The hotel also charges for your use of its in-room safes, and $13/day for wired internet access, both of which are just plain cheap. (Yes, many hotels charge internet access fees, but when you can get free wireless internet in most public areas these days, it just seems really nickel-and-dimey). Overall, though, Bally's was a good deal, and I'm sure plenty of other, more pricey hotels charge similarly for such things. Unless you want lots of frills and extras and are willing to pay for them, stay in Bally's North Tower for a surprisingly nice room with extremely convenient access to the best of Vegas.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenwood Village, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBallys is a mixed bag of both good and bad experiences.\u201d", "Author": "CUSpan", "ReviewID": "UR30741672", "Content": "Ok, so I freely admit that I am one of those travelers that reads reviews about a place I am going for a couple of months before I go. Having read the huge variety of reviews on Ballys, I was a little concerned. Some of the reviews were very accurate, Ballys has some issues, but nothing that kept us from having a good time. The Good - The casino is still nice, not run down like I read in a few reviews. Sure it is not fancy and the poker room is in a bad location, but it is still fun. Ballys is a great location on the strip. You can easily walk to many of the casinos from there, as well as the cab rides are reasonable, being that it is centrally located. The food choices in Ballys are poor, but the food in the walkway to Paris is great. The Paris buffet is fantastic and the price is very competitive with others on the strip. Ballys room service is also very reasonable and the food was good. One thing to be careful of with the room service though, it can come much faster than they tell you. We ordered one night and they told us it would be 45 to 55 minutes. We walked down to the gift shop to get some bottles of water and came back up to the room to find the waiter pounding on our door. We had been gone maybe 10 minutes max, so we could easily have missed it. The North tower rooms are spacious and nice, but some of the views can SUCK. We were on the fifth floor and our view was of a wall about 10 feet away. The Bad - We had requested a room with a King size bed in the North tower and had paid for the upgrade. When we got there the woman checking us in started the check in process, then said she had to go in the back for a minute. Fifteen minutes later she came back to finish. I asked her if there was a problem and she said no, so I asked her why she had disappeared for 15 minutes and left us standing there, and she said she had to go in the back. Never apologized for disappearing. She then said that our King size bed was not available, again no apology. I then asked here if they put a hold on our credit card, and she said yes they did, $250, which is not terrible, but she wasn't going to tell me about it if I hadn't asked. So I asked her if they would just apply it to any charges I had during the stay since I had pre-paid for the room. She proceeded to argue with me about the pre-pay for about 5 minutes until she finally saw that I had prepaid on her computer screen. AGAIN NO APOLOGY. When we showed up to check in there was NO ONE in line and it still took over 30 minutes to check in. Not a good start to the stay. Room service trays sat outside of rooms for anywhere between 18 and 36 hours. Very disgusting, Windows were the dirtiest things I have ever seen. Not even sure how windows could get that dirty.. Each floor had soda machines and vending machines. Most of them wouldn't take dollar bills because the machine was broken and when they were working it was $2.50 for a small soda.

One of our friends didn't and the line was so long it took them an hour and a half to check out.", "Date": "May 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wyandotte, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cMay Not Be New But Still Worth The Stay\u201d", "Author": "mymisfit", "ReviewID": "UR30686542", "Content": "Stayed here May 18-22, 2009 for work.

But if you tip the front desk person that is checking you in, you just might find that they will tip you back by giving you an up-grade with no charge. That is what happend with me. I tipped $20 and got placed in the north tower on the 17th. floor, my co-worker tiped nothing and stayed in the south tower. Was my room better then there's.? That would be up to the person staying in the room, but in my opinion, yes, at least my room had been redone within the last 5 years or so. I had a comfortable bed, housekeeping was great and the noise was not bad at all. The view was not much, but there really is not a view from to many rooms in Bally's I could see the pool and the rooftop. But wasn't in the room much and really did't care.

We were offered the North Tower upgrade for $20.00 extra a night, but we just asked politely if we could get upgraded without paying the extra and our request was granted. The rooms were VERY nice. There was lots of room and they were cleaned and restocked with plenty of towels each day. We never saw any dirty room service plates left in the hall. The windows were a little dusty, but with all of the construction going on, I imagine it would be a never ending chore to keep them spotless. Besides, if you are spending that much time looking out your window while you're in Vegas then you have bigger problems to deal with. The Pool was fantastic. Not as fancy as the Mirage or the Flamingo, but the music was great and there was plenty of sun AND shade. The drinks weren't bad either. For $18.00 you can get a 4 shot margarita. $18.00 sounds like a lot, but the drink was huge and well worth it. In addition, you can bring down your own drinks as long as they are in a plastic container. The food in the hotel was decent as well, we tried the Burger place in Paris, the Skywalk Cafe, and the Paris Buffet, all of which were reasonable and tasty. Oh, and a must try is the yogurt and fruit parfaits they have at the coffee stand across from check-in. My husband became totally addicted to them. About the only complaint I could have is that the live band in the lounge (while VERY talented) was way too loud to be playing so close to the casino.

Can also confirm that room service trays routinely lie in the hallways for hours on end. Very low water pressure from the shower, but good in the tub and sink. Room faced Flamingo Road, where utility work is going on overnight. What a racket. Rest would be hard enough with the mushy bed and pillows; the drilling into the road makes it impossible.

Checked in and out without too much hassle, managing to avoid some of the huge lines I saw at other times. I was able to get a non-smoking but someone I was with couldn't and was stuck in a horrible smoking room. On check-out the clerk didn't ask if I enjoyed myself; guess she knew. The hotel also placed a nearly $1,100 hold on my credit card, even though the company pre-paid the room. When I saw this online (Internet is $14/day for wired) I called downstairs to complain. After 5 minutes waiting for the front desk to answer, I was told they mistakenly held enough for the room & incidentals. Hold still hasn't been released.

In light of the economy, Bally's has made some cuts and considers Paris as part of their property-the Sports Book is closed, as well as the Sidewalk Cafe(used to be their 24 hour casual dining place)-staffers just say\" go to Paris\" as a sub for these things. Well, it is connected to Paris, so I guess that works. If you like coffee without having to sit down to eat somewhere, one only have 2 spots you can go-wait in line! No coffee-makers in rooms. The casino is classic, well laid out, nice selection. It was hopping all the time we were there. One thing they need to work on is the outside cleanliness-I saw a lot of over-flowing trash cans and trash in the waterfall thing on the moving walk-way. Bally's location is the best-right in the middle of the Strip.

Our room was huge and included a table/chairs, couch and tv in sitting area, and wetbar with mini fridge. We were pleased with the size, but that was about it. We had asked for a King (which is what we had reserved) but were told it was a \"request\" and not a reservation for a king. So we had 2 queens - not ideal for a romantic getaway. The room, although big, was grossly out of date. Everything in there had been there for darn near 20 years. We did not have a view out of our window which was also disappointing. The South Tower is a long way from the pool. It was irritating to have to walk all the way through the casino, downstairs, through the shops and out the back to get to the pool. Took about 10-15 minutes. The pool was small. Overall, Bally's is last on my list behind other places I've stayed including the Luxor, Flamingo and even Excalibur. We would not stay there again.

I have been a regular of Ballys for the past 8 years and it used to be a very pleasant stay. I have read the other reviews and I want to clarify that I stayed in the North Tower and my friend stayed in the South Tower so I know first hand the difference. The South Tower is run down and old, the furniture is acient by hotel standards and his room smelled very bad. However, my North Tower room wasn't much better. When I arrived I waited for the North Tower room because I payed to upgrade. They delivered the wrong bag to my room. It a good thing I was there to notice. Thoughout the stay I noticed most of the features have been downsized. The staff definitely was different, in the past Ballys was noted for their customer service. I couldn't get room service, waited on hold for 20 minutes. One day housekeeping didn't even come and I called them as well where they told me they would come. I am a Total Rewards member and the staff couldn't even tell me where the Total Rewards desk was. After 2 calls and being transferred 8 times I found out that it was combined with Paris as well as the concierge so they were located at Paris. Even the basic restaurant was closed after 2pm at Ballys. Now to the room. . . It was dirty and there were stains all over the walls with dead moths on them. Why couldn't housekeeping have cleaned that up. The worst part was the moths. My room was infested with them. They were even in my make up bag. I had housekeeping up in my room early one morning at 3am trying to suck them up in the vacumn. They killed 15 that night alone. I'm told this is a normal problem in April and May however, a cab driver told me he lived there for 20 years and never had a single moth in his house. On an upside, I enjoyed the casino, like the people there. Ballys did take off one of the 3 night upgrades which I feel they should have taken off all due to the problems.

The music filtered throughout the casino and really added to the atmosphere! The food was mediocre, and I'd advice going to the restaurants in Paris just a few hundred yards down the hall.

I heard from other guests that the South Tower rooms sucked, and they had a long list of complaints. Our room was great. We did change rooms after the first night because of noisy neighbors, but the front desk took care of our request right away and put us in a similar room. Both rooms had marble bathrooms, nice showers, and very comfortable beds. Monorail was relatively close (I say relatively because the monorail was far from just about every casino it stopped at, and we went to nearly every stop during our week there) and the location is central if you want to do up the Strip. I'd really advise looking at Bally's is you aren't looking to spend an arm and a leg, but still want the Strip experience!

We were 5 hours early for check in and left our luggage at the guy in charge of the luggage,whomever. We sat at the bar and each put $5 in the video poker and basically drank for free for about 45 mins. We had 3 nights comped and 1 night we paid for. I made sure my buddy requested a North Tower room. The only thing I hate now is if you book a North Tower room online they charge you atleast an additional $30 a night. Its basically the same room just newer and more modern. Well to speak honestly, the South Tower is a dump and is trully outdated,smokey, and lacking anything past the date 1979. So if you book the South Tower room expect just a bed and shower...and if you are not picky you will not mind. Before they started charging an additional charge for North Tower I would just request one at check in. Well now of course they make you pay.

I love the pool bc its big and quiet. And I love the fact its connected to Paris. Do yourself a favor....go to the Paris lunch buffett for $17.99. Ive had it 8 times and lovvvve it. The food selection is great. Hell they have a crepe station where a lady makes you fresh crepes to order with fresh fruit. The bakery across from the buffett charges $13 alone just for crepes. But yes, if you are on a budget stay at Bally's!!!

I landed a terrific deal when I booked the room about 1 1/2 months ago using Harrah's Total Rewards program (four nights comped and the other three nights were $40.00 per night for a total hotel bill for a week well under $150.00). It really was a steal for that price even for a South Tower Room. At check in we were upgraded to a nonsmoking room on the 14th flooor, at no extra cost to the newer North Tower, where we had stayed in August 2008. I can't compare the South Tower Rooms, but the North Tower rooms are now starting to also show their age due to wear and tear I imagine. The room was not cleaned properly after the last guest (used shampoo, a razor head, and a used bar of soap were left in the shower and a glass with water was on the lavetory sink). Tip for all of those like me who really really want a coffee pot in the room for convience. Bally's has removed all of the coffee pots in their hotel rooms, and you can not get them any more from room service either. Walk down to Walgreens just past Planet Hollywood and purchase an inexpensive 4 cup coffee maker for $10, arrange for a small fridge in the room for the cream/milk, and you will be a happy camper. The cost of a Grande cup of coffee is $4, which adds up in a hurry. All along the strip the hotels and stand alone restaurants have some terrific specials and deals for any foodie types. Our top picks 1- Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Paris Paris (amazing views of the Bellagio Fountain displays and 5 star wait staff service and the food!!! OMG!!), 2- Spago in Ceasar's Forum Shops (meatloaf dinner is to die for), 3- Bon Ami Gaba (breakfast and dinner are terrific.. ask for an outside cafe table). We were not impressed with Bally's Steakhouse (escargot was terrible, but the crab cakes were very nice) and at La Dente the experience was awful on several levels so I would really pass on their price fix $19.00 three course meal..(a waiter cleared a large table for dessert and just stacked all the dishes on a nearby four top table for all diners to see. The meatballs were horribly over seasoned with white pepper). Broadly speaking the stand alone restaurant service and food was wonderful, while casino/hotel run restaurants seemed understaffed with diner type wait staff. Final tip - rent a car for a day from Hertz (located by the North Tower elevators) and explore the Hoover Dam without a tour guide and pop on down to Laughlin, a small town with several casinos about 90 miles south of Vegas.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sammycat29", "Title": "\u201cnice rooms, great value, great location, will stay again\u201d", "Author": "sammycat29", "ReviewID": "UR27884420", "Content": "This was our 4th trip to Las Vegas and our first stay at Bally's.

The lady at the desk was extremely friendly and courteous. My boyfriend asked for a room with a view and that is exactly what we got. We were able to see the Eiffel Tower at Paris and the beautiful Bellagio water fountains, as we stayed in the South Tower. There were trays in the hallway as we entered our rooms, but by the time we unpacked and walked out to start our fun filled evening, they were already picked up and this was the case the entire weeked. The rooms were a bit old fashioned, but what is to be expected at a classic hotel. The size of the rooms were great. They were very roomy. The location was awesome and we were able to walk conveniently everywhere that we wanted to go. The bathroom was also nice with a full size mirror which was great.

We were looking forward to staying at Bally\u2019s because we really like the location (centre strip) and the fact it connects to Paris. We received an email from Bally\u2019s with a promotion, and got a really good rate for the south tower. We upgraded to the north tower before arrival for $20 / night, and were really happy with the room at the north tower. The Room The room was quite large. We had two queen size beds, a large desk with two chairs, and another table with a chair. There was a nice amour with TV. There was even a one cup coffee maker. The bathroom was a good size, lots of towels, and a nice tub/shower. Everything in the room was very clean and fresh. The bed linens are duvet style, which I prefer since I get a little nervous about comforters on a hotel bed. The room was extremely comfortable and clean, not overly fancy, but suited us quite well. The Casino The casino is smaller than typical Vegas casinos, however, I liked this because it meant we could easily get around. The location of the north tower rooms is great. When you go down the elevator you are not too far from the monorail (convenient) and only a short walk to the walkway to Paris. It doesn\u2019t take long to get to the strip either. Tips If you are looking to buy bottled water, snacks, alcohol, etc, consider making a short walk from Bally\u2019s out to Stage Door (just down the street on Flamingo) or the 7-11 on Koval (beside Ellis Island, a great place for good food). This can save a lot of money, as a gallon of spring water at 7-11 is $1.99, which a small 500 ml bottle at Bally\u2019s is about $4.

The service was great in every deparment: The bellmen were friendly, checkin was fast and easy, the housekeeper rocked and the valets got our car to us quick. There are two points keeping Bally's from a five - the walkway and the casino. The walkway to get to the strip got on my nerves. You don't have to use it but the main entrance is set really far back from the strip so either way, there is a long hike with nothing worth seeing to get to and from the actual complex. As for the casino, it's boring! The slot selection is weak and the casino has no personality. The saving grace were the cocktail waitress. I was constantly asked for my order and it always came quick. Despite the few shortcomings, I would stay here again.

As many reviewers here have said, Bally's is a good value, and it has a perfect location mid-strip. It is obviously not the best hotel, in terms of 5 star status, but for the price paid, it was definitely above average. One set back, however, was check in. After waiting a couple hours for our \"upgraded\" North Tower room to be ready, we finally entered, only to find a room that had not been cleaned yet. Management responded with an upgrade from that, at no charge. That was obviously the right thing to do, and it kept us forming a bad opinion immediately, over that small mess up. The room we were moved to was in the North Tower as well (the North Tower is the remodeled tower, so we were told). It was nice, and humungous. Probably 700-800 square feet. Big King bed, and sitting area. Up a couple steps to the bi-level was the bathroom / jacuzzi area. Huge, huge jacuzzi. Two vanities, his and her closets, two private commode rooms, one with standard toilet, one with bidet. Very nice. Only nit-pick here was that some of the bathroom area seems to have been missed in the remodel. For example, the marble and tile work. While the rose-colored marble / travertine was still in good condition, it was a bit dated. Grout areas a little dirty, etc. In its hey-dey, when brand new, I'm sure this room was penthouse caliber. But with age, and lack of the right maintenance, comes a slightly run-down feeling. Again, still above average, but in needing of some additional remodeling / updating. Rest of room was fine. Newer carpet, newer furnishings. All in good repair. Room service was very good, too. Tried it several times, each time was a positive experience. So in summary, Bally's will definitely be a great choice for you, if you go in with the right perspective. If money is not an object, and you want the best of the best, pass on Bally's. There are nicer properties in LV.

As I got off the eleavotor there, on a table by the windows, was a styrofoam container with someone's half eaten carry-out dinner inside.When I checked out on Wednesday, it was still there. The hotel's restaurant situation was just as bad. The buffet and deli have closed down. We ate at their steak house one night.Very expensive, and the quality has suffered. I ordered Chateubriand and it was served with, believe it or not, potato chips. That was a first. Not everything was bad. The front desk and the staff at the poker room were friendly and effecient. And, of course the location is great. Unfortunately, it's just not the hotel it once was.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to stay\u201d", "Author": "sc173", "ReviewID": "UR24718777", "Content": "I was a bit nervous about staying at Ballys after reading some of these reviews, but my worries were all for nothing.

We were told that the room would be ready at 1pm and that there would be another line dedicated to folks just picking up keys. Went back at 1:30...no special line, so we waited in the check-in line again. Just 20 minutes or so this time. The room was ready. It was in the South Tower, 73rd floor (the top floor). Walking down the hallway, there was a room service tray outside the door of the room across the hall. This remained there for 4 days. At one point someone tripped over the tray, broke a glass and glass was strewn through the hallway for the next few days. The room was large with a king size bed and 2 fairly comfy chairs. The view was pretty nice, overlooking the Eiffel tower and we could see about 1/2 of the fountains of the Bellagio. The carpet was stained and patched, the bureau drawers were broken but usable. Everything was beige. Bed was quite comfortable. Towels were fluffy and the maid service was quite good. All the employees were very friendly with the exception of the check-in staff...they were quite cold. Didnt care for the casino...dont know why, just didnt get a good feeling there. One note of caution if you are planning to see a show out there...we found this place (several actually) called Tix4Tonight. It was in front of Bill's Gambling Hall across the street and was touting 1/2 price tickets. We waited an hour in line and bought tickets for Cirque do Solie (KA). We were charged $109 each and were given a VOUCHER for a ticket which we had to present at the actual box office of the show (MGM) to get a real ticket. We were told the sooner we got there, the better the seats. So we walked right over, waited in another line there for about a half hour and got our tickets. The face value on the ticket was $87.50! So I paid an extra $20/ticket for what??? You're better off just going directly to the box office to buy your tickets..who knew? 1/2 price??? I dont think so. Anyway, the seats were very good, 6th row, center stage. Worth the money to us, but we could have gotten the same for 20 bucks less. Live and learn I guess. All in all a pleasant experience, and the location is perfect, just about dead center in the strip.

Had a very friendly and professional young lady check us in. We had booked a South Tower room, but was given a North Tower room, 21st floor, facing airport. Very big bathroom, wonderful linens, everything super clean. The TV was \"haunted\" (turning off/on by itself, changing channels on it's own), a call to maintenance and we were told the hotel really was haunted, but they would still send someone up to look at it. No one came, but it really was no big deal as we were not there to watch TV. Went down to explore the casino and sign up for the players card, couldn't find the booth, asked two employees and no one knew where to send us - turns out they closed the on-site player's booth and we would have to go to Paris. No biggie, we thought. Well, it's WAY on the other side of Paris from Bally's. We eventually found it and signed up. The casinos in both hotels were very quiet, and it turns out it was the case everywhere we went. One negative experience, we had a letter in our room at check in that offered us discounted tickets to both Jubiliee there in Bally's and Penn & Teller at Rio. We wanted to see Penn & Teller, so in the morning we went down to the box office and was told quite rudely that to get the discounted price, we had to go to Rio and buy the tickets there. I protested that the letter didn't say that and we didn't want to waste time going there now in the morning, but she didn't seem to care. As it turned out we took a chance to buy the tickets right before the show, got nine rows back center stage for half price an hour before showtime. It was a great show and the price was terrific! Penn & Teller greeted the audience after the show to sign autographs and that was very nice! Played a bit at Bally's, cocktail service was very quick and friendly at both slots and tables. It was about the only major Strip casino that we saw cocktailers of all ages and sizes - and we thought that was very cool! Every casino employee we dealt with were terrific - fun dealers, nice waitresses. They had a great band in the lounge called JAMM, really enjoyed them. Moving walkway to the Strip was not working our first day, but was up by the second day. The walkway to Paris is very nice and convenient, with lots of neat shops and restaurants. We dined at LeVillage Buffet in Paris for dinner and it was very good! Used the shuttle to Rio and it was fast and convenient. We would most definitely stay at Bally's again, the location is terrific and convenient to the best on the Strip.

The driver was at baggage claim awaiting our arrival. All went smooth. We arrived at Bally's in a timely manner. I will go through the major topics. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I am a new Diamond member. We reserved our hotel from 1/22-25 and received 2 comp days and had to pay $85 for the Saturday night. Checkin - Checkin was smooth. There was a short line, but it moved smoothly. Being a new Diamond member, I didn't know that I could have bypassed the line. The lady at the desk told me. I was given a King Suite in the North Tower. The room was ready so we headed up. Rooms - The rooms are fairly large. They needed some upkeep but they were clean and well kept. The King Suite didn't look like a suite to me, but I had nothing to compare it to. It was nice. Casino - ALL of the Dealers were fantastic. The staff at Ballys were phenomenal. I really have nothing bad to say about any of the employees. They were great. They had quite a few $5 tables. We had a good time. Paris - We walked over to Paris a few times. The casino and its dealers were very nice...we had a good time, but their tables would go up pretty often, so we always went back to Bally's. Its really funny....I normally play $10, but I don't like a casino to tell me that's the lowest I can play...I like the option to play less if I so choose. We visited Hard Rock, Rio, Riviera (Had a ball there), Gold Coast (they took out a lot of their tables) and Paris. All in all we had a fabulous time. We would definetly stay at Bally's again, and in the end we stayed another day and got comped for our entire stay. We didn't have to pay a dime. Food - We mostly ate room service, but we went to Bally's Steakhouse and the cafe...both were nice, but of course the Steakhouse was fantastic. The food was great, but a bit over priced. Bally's could use a renovation (peeling paint, old decor, etc.) but all in all it is a nice property and we would definetly stay again. Below I have rated our hotels from the best to the least best.

I was pleasantly surprised by how well maintained the room appeared to be. The furnishings were in good repair and seemed pretty modern. However, I have two main complaints: 1. They let room service dishes sit out in the hallways for hours and even days at a time. I had to call for them to pick up my neighbor's dishes on two different days. If I hadn't called, who knows when they would have thought to come back to get them. That's sad because the general maid service was good. 2. The bed was the single most uncomfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. I remember a friend telling me that he also thought the beds at Bally's were too hard. But I chanced it anyway because of the super low price. It really wasn't worth the low price because the bed was SO unbearable. I tossed and turned and slept very poorly because of the terrible mattress. If you normally sleep on the floor or a wooden board, then this is the hotel for you.

Other guests of the wedding that we were attending stayed at the Imperial and would have switched hotels if they could have. It was a real dive. They spent as much time out of the hotel that they could and only returned to sleep. Ok, our flight got in around 11:00 PM and we took one of the shuttles into the hotel. There were about 5 guests ahead of us to check in and it went quickly. I had requested a room in the North Tower (after looking at different reviews) and also had $20.00 in my hand (which I ended up tipping the counter attendant with). We were told that there were no rooms left in the North Tower that night, but they would put us in a suite for the night then would be moved the next day. We were good with that. Well, the suite had as many square feet as my house (1,800). One huge kitchen / bar / full bath / living room with pull out couch / two tvs, and much more, and a wall of windows that overlooked the Eiffel Tower next door... nice. The bedroom had a king bed, two dressing areas, a sunken hot tub, an enclosed shower, enclosed toilet, and thirdly an enclosed bidet. The wall of windows in this room also overlooked the Tower. After a quick sleep, we were still on our home time, so we were up and gone by 9:00 their time and we spent the morning exploring and sightseeing. We came back to switch rooms and they moved us to a nice room in the North Tower. The room was clean, modern and enjoyable to be in. The hotel may not have been the fanciest on the strip, but we found it located centrally, and if we wanted glitter, glam, and to be wowed, we just had to walk out the door, and turn right, left or cross the street. You can wander all the hotels to see the sites, but there isn't really a need to pay the extra just to sleep, which is what we were using our room for. The casino was pretty much the same as all the rest (we didn't gamble very much). Check out was quick and easy (we just had to settle up for the high speed access) and we hopped a shuttle back to the airport.

We were upset by this since we agreed to what we were offered to begin with, and then we waited for 3 hours to get it. To compensate us the manager offered to only charge us for three nights of the upgrade price rather than the five days we were staying. At this point we had no other choice but to take that offer. The day before we checked out we looked at our bill and saw that the bill included charges for five days of the upgraded $20/day. We called the front desk, spoke with that manager and went through the whole story again. He agreed to take off the 2 days like we originally agreed to. Then at check out time, you guessed it. The full charges for the five days were back on the bill again. We went through the whole thing again for the third time. This manager was not helpful at all. He kept insisting there was nothing he could do about it. I told him to speak with the two other managers who already agreed to removing the two additional night charges. He said he would look into it and email me what he finds out. That was two days ago and I have not received an email, nor have I received my reduced compensations that was promised upon check in.

After checking in, we asked for a map of Vegas Strip at the Bell Desk, the staff didn't say anything but just tore off a page (map) from a magazine and gave us that \"map\", he then threw the whole magazine into the garbage bin right away. Do you want to be treated in this way on your very first day of holidays? When we entered to the hotel room, we were surprised that the room was smelly and dusty (we'd been told that it was a non-smoking room and we'd paid at a regular rate for staying for three nights). Moreover, there was an empty envelope with coffee marks left on the bedside table. There were no coffee- maker, no hot/cold water, no fridge in the room. We stayed three nights in the hotel and we found the room service was terrible. They just replenished the soap, shampoo and towels but not changing any bedsheets or cleaning the room for you.

I walked south to Excalibur several times (only Luxor and Mandalay Bay are further south). Going north is a longer trip and Bally's has a monorail station, plus the Deuce (bus) has a stop right in front of Bally's on Las Vegas Blvd.. The casino was busy at all times of the day.

I love the couch and the desk area, shower was good and our room did not have a coffee maker but a request to housekeeping and it was there.

Although the room was free, I do have some minor issues surrounding the hotel that annoyed me. Most of the hotel staff seemed friendly and willing to help, however there was several instances at one of the hotel restaurants where the wait staff were publicly arguing over issues that should have been done in private. Concerning the room itself, there isn\u2019t much to say except that it was very nice and enjoyable. We stayed on the 24th floor of the hotel, and the room was spacious and comfortable. We chose a room with a king size bed, and we felt the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was nice and felt clean. Our view of the city wasn\u2019t good, but I can sort expect that with a free room. If I had paid for the room out of pocket, I would have been a little ticked off. There was no small refrigerator or microwave and this really surprised me. These are items that have become to be expected within a room at most hotels. How else are you going to bring back and keep drinks and food to keep them cool? You had to pay $3.00 a day for a usage fee for the safe in your room, which I felt was uncalled for within a hotel that caters to people with money and/or valuables. They have glassware in the rooms instead of disposable ones. The reason that I have an issue with this is because most hotel glassware will never ever leave your room to make it to a downstairs dishwasher. A maid will typically wash these in your bathroom sink. If you have ever seen any news reports about how they are washed, you would not fully trust any room glassware at any hotel/motel. The last item concerns transportation. At some hotels that I\u2019ve stayed at, they offer free shuttle service back and forth from the airport, and I sort of expected to see this service being offered to guest within a tourist town. If the shuttle service was free, I don\u2019t how it is done unless I missed something somewhere. Three of us took a $16.00 cab ride from the airport to the hotel, since we had heard the shuttle would cost about $20.00 per person, If this is true, then we saved over $40 dollars one way. I would give the room about 4 stars out of 5, but because of the little issues that I mentioned, I would drop my rating down to 3 stars. Would I stay there again?

Our room was in the South tower (closest to the strip), on the 18th floor, with a south facing view of Paris and Bellagio, and the south part of the strip. The room was basic in decor, at little dated, but not bad. Two queen beds (comfortable), a six drawer chest, a small round table and two chairs, a large closet with mirrored doors, a big bathroom with loads of mirrors, and a fantasic window wall overlooking the south strip. The South tower has one set of six elevators, 3 for the lower floors and 3 for the upper floors. The South tower is closest to the strip, but furtherest from the restaurants, connector to Paris, pool, spa and parking. If you drive, you have to park behind Paris or use the Bally's valet. Check-in and out was super, super easy. Ordered room service for one breakfast. A little slow, but very nice and tasty. Ate at the Sidewalk Cafe twice. Good food, good service, reasonable prices. Order the fruit plate (not on the menu, but a real good option!). Bally's has no buffet currently, but Paris has a good one next door. The pool is a long walk, as is the spa and the monorail station. The South tower has better views than the North tower, but the North tower had more recently decorated and updated rooms. You will pay more for North tower rooms.

I tried to book online at Bally's but when I hit the button to make a reservation, it told me that I would need to call the 800 number directly, which I did. I was looking at the \"hot deal\" prices on the computer as I was talking to the booking agent. She quoted me a price that was higher...I had to tell her that I wanted a \"hot deal\" (there is a button on the website to see the \"hot deal\" price). So we sorted out the nights and the price but I was distracted when she quoted me the final price. It was only when we went to check out that I realized that I didn't not get the hot deal price that I had asked for. Granted, it was only a difference on $20 for the two nights, but it could have been 200. Incidentally, I was so sure that we had agreed on the lower rate that I had them pull the recording of the phone call, but all they needed was to hear me agree to a total regardless of the rates we had discussed during the course of the call. They wouldn't budge. We were given a decent room in the South tower...it was clean and always had lots of towels. It looked out on to Bill's Gambling Hall and we could see the end of the Bellagio fountains. We were on the 16th floor and it was remarkably quiet. From where we were, you practically needed a shuttle to get to the pool and the monorail, but the pool area was quiet and there was no shortage of chairs (North Tower rooms would be a bit closer to pool) We ate at Al Dente using a Tix 4 Tonight deal...it was well worth it. We each had a drink ($10 for a single!), an appetizer and an entree and the bill was about $80 including tip. The casino was smoky; there were others that were worse but there were quite a few that were better too. All in all, I feel pretty confident that Bally's was as good as anything that we could have gotten on the Strip for the price we paid. At the end of the day, 7 days on the Strip is about 3 too many regardless of where you stay!", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spingfield, IL", "Title": "\u201cBally's is Fantastic and Fabulous!\u201d", "Author": "gregg1969", "ReviewID": "UR20994133", "Content": "I stayed at Bally\u2019s on October 13-17, 2008. I had been in the casino previously (very nice, and I always do well in there), but had never stayed at the hotel. After reading many of the reviews on this website and other websites, I had my doubt about whether Bally's was a good choice. All of my doubts were erased within 20 minutes of being inside the hotel. Check-in - I had absolutely no trouble in checking in. There were plenty of desk clerks working and I only had to wait 10 minutes before I was able to check in. Although check in was 4:00pm, I was able to check in 2 hours early. My reserved room was in the south tower, but I asked to upgrade to the north tower ($20 a day charge). I decided to live it up a little, and upgraded to a grand suite. This upgrade was $100.00 per day, but since I hadn't paid a lot for my original vacation package, I thought it worth doing. The suite was on the 20th floor (also a non-smoking floor) and faced the north. The Suite - The suite itself was very beautiful, and looked exactly like it does in the virtual overview on Bally\u2019s website. Bally\u2019s website says that these suites have a wet bar and refrigerator in them (mine didn\u2019t), but this was not an issue to me. The safes do require a $3.00 fee per day, but I never used it, nor was I ever charged for it. And for those who have complained about the dirty windows, yes, my windows had the usual dirt and grime on the outside of it. My windows were also dirty when I stayed at the Monte Carlo, MGM Grand, Stardust, and Bellagio, so this is not a phenomenon that is unique to Bally\u2019s. I did have a balcony, but the door to it was bolted shut. I am sure that the hotel does this for safety reasons. I never noticed any stains on the carpet in my suite, nor did I notice any on the hallway floors. The ventilation system in the suite was adjustable and did not make any excessive noise. The only flaw in the suite was that a little of the fiberglass was wearing off next to one of the handrails on the Jacuzzi. It was only a small spot, but it was nothing for me to call management about. I only had the TV on a few times to check my room balance and to check out of the hotel, but I did notice that the channels were limited. Since I didn\u2019t come to Las Vegas to watch TV, this was something else that I could easily overlook. Housekeeping allowed me to peek into other rooms that were not occupied. I am satisfied that the north tower rooms at Bally\u2019s are quite nice and would have no qualms about staying in one on a future visit. Dining - The Sidewalk Caf\u00e9 serves good food and it is fast, depending on what time of day you go. I went in the mid-afternoons and was in and out in under an hour. Pricewise, I did not find this place expensive. I ate at the Tequila Bar a few times; great food and great prices, plus they have half price margaritas from 4:00pm until 7:00pm. I also ate at Johnny\u2019s Deli my first night, but it closed permanently a few days later. I\u2019m not sure why the hotel closed it, because it was busy the night I was there (Monday night football, plus the race and sports book was directly across from it) and it was busy when I walked past it several times on Tuesday. I thought about going to Bally\u2019s Steakhouse, but opted for the steak house at Bill\u2019s Gambling Hall instead. Excellent food at Bill\u2019s, with prices somewhat cheaper than Bally\u2019s. Hotel Staff - Every single Bally\u2019s employee that I encountered went out of their way to be friendly. I never once encountered a rude hotel employee in the 5 days that I stayed. Even the Housekeeping staff were polite and would make small talk as I passed them in the hallways. Pool - The pool is a good distance from the rooms, but if you take the elevator to the pool level, you only have to walk past the shops to get to where you are going. I never used the pool, but walked around the grounds a few times. Although it wasn\u2019t packed, the pool area was quite busy in the afternoons. Elevators - The longest I ever had to wait for an elevator was about 45 seconds. There are 2 banks of elevators, with 6 or 8 elevators in each bank. One bank is for the for the 2-15th floors and the other serves the 16-26th floors. The elevators were even speedy when I checked out on Friday morning at 9:30am. Would I stay at Bally\u2019s again? Absolutely. Although Bally\u2019s isn\u2019t as flashy and opulent as the Bellagio, Venetian, and Caesars Palace, it is still a very elegant, classy hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to people with children, but then I would never take a child to Las Vegas anyway.

This was our third trip to Las Vegas, first stay at Bally's. Previously stayed at the Flamingo and MGM Grand. When booking Bally's - we requested an early check-in as our flight was 10:30 am arrival. The McCarren Airport is so easy to navigate through, we waited 10 minutes for our luggage and then we were off.....we decided to hire a taxi this time - we split the cost with another couple - the total for the 4 of us was $15 (incl. tip). We arrived at Bally's around 11:00 am - the check-in line was long - but it moved very quickly. We booked a South Tower room for $59/Night (Hotel Website Hot Deal Special) The desk clerk asked us if we would like to upgrade our room to the North Tower for $20 extra a night, we said no thank you - she continued to push the North Tower on us by saying that we wouldn't like the South Tower room because it's old and needs renovating - when we didn't bite at first - she then said we'd have to wait as the room was not available until after 4:00 pm. When we didn't respond - she added that she would give us an extra upgrade that she normally was not allowed to do and we could have the room immediately and she would only charge us $20/night. Of course we thought we were getting a huge deal here so we signed up - my friend was getting antsy and wanted to hit the pool area and get our vacation started. When we arrived at our upgraded room - we found that it was the standard North Tower Room (not the extra upgrade she led us to believe) we requested a King Bed - but received 2 doubles. The window view was a roof top and the swimming pool in the distance. Not a big deal to us - as we just wanted a clean bed and bath area as we don't plan to spend much time in our room anyway. I would class this room as \"standard\" it may have been updated as they stated - but seemed just standard to me - it made me courious to know what the South Tower room looked like. (but I never did see a South Tower Room to compare). We settled in - for $79/night - This room was very clean - the bathroom was spotless - we never heard any noise during the night - from hallways or other rooms - the bed and pillows were comfortable - the daily housekeeping excellent - replenished towels daily. My only complaint about the room - it was extremely \"dry\" and we all had sore throats and dry noses - not sure if it was the ventilation of the hotel or just the Vegas weather (wind) at this time of year. This hotel is so easy to navigate through - you can take the elevator straight down to a hallway leading to the pool without walking through the casino area in your swimwear. I loved the pool area - towels and lounge chairs were plentiful. We found the bar drinks by the pool very expensive - so the next day we brought our own drinks down to the pool (we purchased from a variety store down the strip for less than half the cost). We gambled at Bally's most days - we found that all the staff were very friendly especially at the Roulette Table. Bally's is connected to Paris - so that was also a plus. Bally's location on the strip (to me) is perfect - you can walk in either direction to all the major hotels on the Strip. We walked to The Luxor one night - another night to the Palazzo. We took The Deuce for $5 (24hr pass) to Downtown one night - I wouldn't take the bus again - it took over an hour each way - next time I would taxi it - faster and less crowded. Downtown is fun as always - the gambling is looser on the machines and the table limits so much lower then the Strip - Hotels are older - a little seedy - but lots of fun. I found the casino(s) very smokey this time.... We had the Prime Rib Dinner Special at Bill's Gambling Hall for $7.99 - It was delicious. The Paris Buffet Breakfast for $14.99 was amazing. We went to the \"V\" Variety Show this visit - $75 each - The show was entertaining for sure - but I think a little over priced. I've been to Cirque Shows and for the value - so much better. We love Las Vegas and plan to go every year - Bally's is a nice hotel \"Standard\" and \"Clean\" and you can't beat the location. I will probably not stay here again as there are so many choices to choose from. But I did enjoy my experience here. Remember.....bring comfortable shoes (lots of walking) - a daily gambling budget - be sure to take in at least 1 show - and relax and have a great time - don't sweat the small stuff - you are after all - on vacation.", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arvada", "Title": "\u201cWas just as reviewed-okay because it was on the strip but dirty windows, etc.\u201d", "Author": "ArvadaLiketoTravel", "ReviewID": "UR20904654", "Content": "Most importantly we booked through Travelocity.

Our room was dated, carpet stained, and I pulled the bedcover off the bed altogether because I did not trust it had been washed. Still we got are forth night free.

Oh, and the room was spacious. Then on to the bad: Bally's is a hotel from the seventies, and that must have been when the room they gave me was last remodelled. I have to be fair and add that they probably changed the beds since then, but that's it. Aside from the bed, the room was virtually empty, exept for some run-down furniture. No fridge, no sofa, just a chair, a table, and one cupboard that looked like it belonged in a garage. There were dice-sized dents in the wall, and the carpet was full of stains. The whatever-it-is-called device that gets fresh air into the bathroom made as much noise a fighter jet, fortunately I could turn it off. Only that didn't make much difference, since it was audible as long as someone else in a nearby room had it on, which was just about all the time. Did I mention that the sheets actually had holes in them? Overall, these are defects I can live with if I sleep at Motel 6 -if there are no alternatives and the price is right- but at Bally's neither is the case, which makes it a rip-off in my book.

I love this hotel because of it's location, it's right in the middle of the Strip. And as this was my 8th trip to Las Vegas (3rd at Ballys) I know my way around the back roads so find it easy to get to the hotel. We had room 888 (easy to remember after one too many cocktails!) We've had nicer rooms in the past but this was big and roomy and clean. Two very comfy double beds. We didn't have much of a view and the windows aren't very clean anyway but I don't go to Vegas to look at the view from my window. I suppose the downside of this hotel is that it's quite a long walk from the car park to the hotel reception, particularly when you are dragging a suitcase but it's not that big a deal and you can always use valet park if you want to but we don't find it necessary. We got the bus to Fremont Street one night which was fun, we always do it and i would recommend a couple of hours down there. You need the correct change for the bus ($2 per person) as the drivers don't carry change. We had dinner at Tony Roma's which is in the Fremont Casino then got huge cocktails and watched two light shows (the best I've ever seen) and danced to the live band before getting the bus back up the Strip and went dancing at the Carnaval Court until 3am. There is no cover charge and no poseurs strutting their stuff - just the average person out for a dance and some fun. An extremely large vodka (Smirnoff) and coke was $10. There was a band for a while and then a DJ but nothing arsey. We also went to the top of the Stratosphere and got there just before it started getting dark which is a great time to go as you see the Strip 'come alive' and it was amazing.

The bed was quite comfortable, the love seat was a nice touch and the thermostat was easy to use & kept the room at a nice cool temperature. Really the only complaints I have about the room are that I think the shower should have doors instead of the dollar store curtain they throw up, and also the housekeepers need to do a better job of refilling the towels. As for the Bally's property, since I wasn't there 24/7 it was allright. The choice of restaurants could've been better, and the lack of a decent place to get coffee (other than a way overprices wannabe starbucks kiosk) was a bit of a turn-off. The problem with Bally's is that it's a long walk to get anywhere on property. Also, the pool area is pretty dull. The fact that they have a deep end - a rarity on the strip - is nice, but there's really nothing going on there, sort of a letdown if you've been to mandalay, mirage or any of the other places on the strip that have superb pools. Overall I really can't complain too much. Employees who I encountered were very nice, dealers were mostly very nice, and they were very accomodating with anything I asked for.

Check-in was about 20 minutes -- not bad considering how long (and it was loooong) the line was. The front desk staff we dealt with was very nice. Love that the hotel is joined with Paris Hotel and that navigating to other Strip hotels is fairly easy given all the escalators/walkways outside of Bally's...and there is a free shuttle to Rio. Casion was always very lively. Valet parking was much faster than other hotels. Cons: Bed could have been better for sure. A little too firm for us. Stay FAR away from the 'Sidewalk Cafe' NASTY food and terrible, terrible service...don't say you haven't been warned. We weren't the only ones in there complaining. Dining options are pretty limited. Did experience a bit of noise inside the room...some noise from the side road that our tower faced (we were on the 7th floor), and noise from adjoining rooms...not nearly as bad as the noise we had at The Mirage though.

When we arrived we were informed that our dog had to be taken up with the luggage, instead of on our leash. At the front check in, we were greeted very nicely until we mentioned we were looking for our dog which was taken by baggage handlers. The desk clerk at first insisted they did not allow pets, and after a short \"near argument\" in which we had to show her the website states they were pet friendly,she said that we had to immediately pay an additional \"50 dollars per day!\" We had been booked for nine days, which meant she expected us to pay 400 dollars more for the remaining unpaid pet deposit, (the other eight days that our dog was staying with at the hotel.) She would'nt the baggage handlers to take Mutley up to the room or release him to us until the balance was paid. Ultimately I the baggage handler, who was not equipped to hold the dog released him to me outside on a side street, and we sneaked him up to our room through a side entrance. Because we are not rich people, we had saved for this trip, unbelievably we had to \"pretend\" to board the dog after the first day. Which meant we hid \"Mutley\" out and made us feel like criminals. Sneaking him out at odd hours through the back entrances to do his business. In addition the over zealous desk clerk called the room 5-7 times the first evening to ask us to come down and pay the 400 dollar balance, and eventually began calling making sure we had gotten the dog out. She made it her mission to question and watch us everytime we passed by the front desk into the casino. We love to stay at this hotel but worry each time we take our dog and hope that the desk clerk from hell has quit Bally's and gone back to work for Osama Bin Laden.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronxville, NY", "Title": "\u201cBally's - 8/24-8/28 weekend Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "FastMazz", "ReviewID": "UR18423398", "Content": "I booked this hotel way back in March and specifically requested a room on a high floor that had a view of the Bellagio water fountains. I called several times before my arrival to make sure that my requests would be honored, which was for a North Tower room with a view of the Bellagio water fountains. When I arrived at this hotel at 10:30 AM (wearing my tripadvisor hat), check-in line was a breeze. I was told then that I check in is at 3 PM but they would accommodate me to give me a room at 10:30 AM. I told them that I really wanted a view of Bellagio and they said \"yes we see your request.\" I got my key and went to the room. The check in agent never once mentioned that I wasn't going to get the view I wanted. When I got to the room, the first thing I went towards was the windows which I opened them and lo and behold, the view I had was towards the mountains, casino parking lot and some trailer parking lot (which is a bit boring) and disappointed me already. I felt that the hotel should have offered right away that they want to accommodate our requests and offer to watch our bags with the bellhop so we could get the room we wanted later while we would do whatever we wanted in Vegas from 10:30 am to 3 pm. I even wore my trip advisor hat in hopes that I might get upgraded to something nicer. That never happened. Instead they didn't say anything about the room I was going to get, and put me in a room looking back towards the mountains instead. I wasn't happy with that. Considering that Bally's was a hotel and its interiors were clean, the outside windows were really dirty (soot build up or dried mud from dust/rain). I wondered when was the last time Bally's washed their exterior windows? How often do they clean their exterior windows? The room: The room I was in, 2272, I was told then that I check in is at 3 PM and was given a room in the North tower. When I walked into the room, the first thing I noticed right away was that it had a big red stain on the rug in front of the bed about the size of a small pancake. I called the hotel several times before I arrived, was assured that the room I was booked in had a view of the Bellagio water fountains. I wondered all week where that red stain came from, as it did look like it was a wine stain however it was really red. Ugh already...... The room itself wasn't as big as I expected it to be, inside there was a marble desk attached to the wall, that had a telephone and internet access which is $11.99 per day billable to the room or credit card. The television remote control took some learning when switching between closed captioning and television mode, however there were no \u201cpremium\u201d channels but had the standard channels with USA/TNT, etc. Television reception was clear. The air conditioner worked great, I liked having my room really cold as the heat outside during July is a little unbearable as I felt like I was being baked and not sweating because of how dry outside is. There was no refrigerator inside the room. The hotel provided an ironing board and iron which came in handy when I needed it. I did not use the safe, as previous posters reported the safe has a daily fee of usage. The curtains were great for keeping the lights out if you wanted to sleep late, it did keep the room dark when it wasn't open, then again in the back of the hotel is a shade. The bathroom: The shower water pressure was not that great and you had to use high pressure (which wasn't really high pressure) to take a shower. Towels provided by the hotel were nice, large and soft. When requested extra towels, they were available. A single sink. The hotel provided soap, shampoo, conditioners and lotion. The soap left my skin feeling a bit dry after the shower, but the shampoo & conditioner worked well. The room itself was provided with a coffee maker & hair dryer. I never got around to drinking the coffee as the brand was something not familiar with so never got around to making a cup of coffee. I was disappointed already that my accommodation requests were not made, right away my roommate did not want to pack everything again to move and wanted to go out and not stay in so we never got around to changing the room. I really wanted a strip view, and instead got a view of the mountains. As I don't always see mountains I didn't mind this, but the fact that Bally's did not honor my specific request going back from March left a negative feeling. Bally's is in two sections, North Tower and South Tower. When I was in the North Tower, I felt like that was all Bally's had to offer by the ambience of it. I recommend that you take the time to explore the subterranean section connecting the two hotels and going to see what is inside the South Tower, as I still wonder. There is a pool that I never got to use, but from the view in my room, it didn't appear to be small as some people say, and it did look like there were always available chairs. The casino: On the casino floor there was a bar behind the poker room with video poker, and they had Rapid roulette which I played and thought it was fun as it is quicker than regular roulette, the standard blackjack, Texas hold em, pai gow, Bet the Set, etc, and a variety of table games, however the tables itself was limited to about 12-15 tables which made the casino look small to me. I did not realize until the last day of my stay when we wanted a quick bite to eat that there is a sub-terranean section of the hotel connecting North and South tower. I felt that there should have been signs posted pointing to \"South Tower\" or the subterranean section but did not see any. So, I never got around to seeing the South Tower so I have no idea what's inside the main area. There's this casino that might be considered small by Las Vegas standards. The poker room had about 10 tables, and there was always a game going on. The poker room staff were very nice and quickly came with our chips whenever we wanted more. Drink service was good, as I didn't have to wait very long for the chips. There was an abundance of a variety of slot machines and did have a high roller area for slot machines but did not see that many people use it. I played poker most of the time and lost a few hundred on the slot machines there. Poker games offered was 1-2 no limit and 2-4 limit. Other games could be available and Bally's had poker tournaments as well. Underground there is a few places to eat, Sabarros, a New York deli, Chinese and several stores. There were tournament slot machines in the middle and it made me wonder what was in the South tower and never got around to it. The point I'm making here is that while staying at the North Tower, it felt like that was all Bally's building had to offer itself. I never ate inside Bally\u2019s except for the deli on the last day. I usually had my breakfasts and lunches at Paris at Le Buffet which was good but nothing to rave about except the large selection of foods. I did however enjoy the breakfast across from Le Buffet which made excellent croissant egg and ham sandwiches, a bit steep though $9.99, I'd recommend the restaurant across from Le Buffet if you don't want to wait on line (the lines were usually so long that it was outside the door, it took some time to get a table every morning. I played a couple slot machines in Paris, and I felt claustrophobic with its low curved ceilings that are painted to resemble a sky. I did like the interior of Paris as it did feel like I was in Paris. The lobby of North tower: The lobby was really pretty and easy on the eyes, however from the check in to the elevators was a bit of a walk as you had to walk through the slot machine area in order to get to the elevators. Even the bathrooms were far back in the casino near the elevators. I did not think the casino was that smoky as reported in the past, and I am a smoker. I felt like I never had to wait for an elevator from the first floor and it did not take that long to get an elevator from the 22nd floor either. Outside of Bally\u2019s: I always felt like it was a bit of a long walk from the people mover at \"Station Entrance\" to the checkout desk to access the outside of the hotel. Due to the heat in July, it made getting to the hotel feel far and long. There is a side entrance in the North Tower which gives you close access to \"Bills Gambling Hall\", which I used most of the time to exit. However I ended up getting into the hotel via the Station Entrance. I don't think I'll be returning to Bally's again in the future unless was offered comp rooms with the views I wanted. I would not depend on them in the future to honor my requests. Most likely if I was spending money for hotel, I would stay someplace else.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cpoker\u201d", "Author": "vonkluck", "ReviewID": "UR18391451", "Content": "Like others I received a room upgrade at check in.

The front desk staff was very pleasant and efficient. We asked for a North tower room (preferring a renovated room over a view), which was provided. We were advised to return later when the room was ready to pick up the keys. We returned a little before noon and our room was ready. We were very pleased with the room. It was a non-smoking king, as requested, and had not a hint of smokiness. The location was on the12th floor, with another room only on one side of us and an emergency stairwell on the other side (It was nice and quiet throughout our stay). The room was large, clean, bright, and in great condition. At first we thought the mattress seemed too firm and we thought it was going to be uncomfortable, but we actually slept great. The bathroom was a comfortable size, with a tub/shower combo. The sundries included the basic shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, and a compact wall mount Conair hairdryer. One thing we weren't used to was the $3 charge to use the room safe, oh well, guess it's worth it. Our view was basically of the back of the Paris. We could see a glimpse of the Paris Eiffel Tower between buildings and, standing at the window, an angled partial glimpse of the Bellagio fountains. Not a great view\u2026 we have had better, but we have also had worse! I forgot about the long walk through the Avenue Shoppes/food court/sports bar area to get to Bally's pool. I\u2019m glad I had a good cover-up! We were there around 1:15 (Friday) and the pool was busy, but not too crowded. We had no problem getting two lounge chairs in the sun. The music the DJ was playing seemed pretty loud, and it took a little getting used to when we were in the pool right in front of the speakers. Drink service was good, and the water temperature was perfect! Bally's location on the strip is great, close to center, so it is convenient to Caesar's, Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, Flamingo, and much more. It's easy to head out one direction one day, and the other the next. We spent most of our gambling time at the Paris, and there are more dining options there, so the indoor connection is also a great plus.

I was torn between asking for an upgrade to a North tower room and staying with my booked South tower room, but with a chance of having a view of the Bellagio water fountains or strip view. I decided to leave it to chance. When we checked in, around 11am, we only waited for 10 minutes and we were upgraded to a North tower room without even asking. It was a good start to our trip. We were on the 15th floor, nonsmoking room, king size bed. The room was very nice and HUGE. You could practice ballroom dancing in this room. It had a desk with a granite top which had seating on both sides. The bathroom was very large and roomy, with granite tiles on the floor and in the shower. The granite counter top was nice also. The only down side to this room was the view was of the roof of the building next door. But we didn\u2019t spend much time looking out the window in our room. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. There was no smoky smell in the room at all. The casino did smell a little of smoke, but not as bad as I had read about.

I had booked a South Tower room on a special promotion for $50/night, for two nights. I didn't get to check-in until almost 8pm because I had been in Laughlin all day. The check-in experience went like this: There were only two clerks working the desk and there wasn't a line, but both clerks were helping someone. I stand at the front of the rope waiting to be next. Here comes this woman stomping up to the counter and demands to be helped. The clerk was helping someone else and told the lady to get in line. So the woman stomps over and stands right in front of me and tells me in no uncertain terms that she was going to be next. Whatever, lady. When the clerk was done the lady stomps over and starts freaking out about something. Honestly, I don't know what she was yelling about and I didn't bother listening. I just zoned out and waited. The clerk tells the woman to go down to another desk and wait for a manager. The same clerk waves me over to be helped and the lady steps a couple feet over. I was planning on asking the clerk if I could get any kind of view of the fountains with my South Tower room, but after she just got done being yelled at I didn't say a thing. I just handed her my reservation paper and my ID/CC. She click, click, clicked away and then handed me some keys and told me I'd be in the North Tower. I REALLY wanted to be in the South Tower for the potential of a fountain view, but didn't object. I knew this was an upgrade since North Tower was a few years more renovated than South. So I thanked her and went on my way. I'm dragging my bags down a really long hallway. I am really annoyed because I am all the way at the end of the hall. Last door! I practically walked to Ellis Island! I open the door, put my bags against the wall, see the armoir, couch, bed, and then my head keeps turning to the right and I see I have a HUGE JACUZZI and marble floors and two huge closets, and two sink/vanity areas.

We booked the North Tower as we were aware that the South Tower contained rooms that had not been renovated. The rooms were great. They were large and clean. The beds were not horrible but the pilllows left me with a stiff neck every day. Beware!!! If you use the safe, they charge you $3.00 a day...can you imagine that...not even in Italy, where they try to charge you for the air you breathe, do they charge for using the safe. You would think that they would want your belongings safe in the room. The Indigo lounge, one of our favorite late night spots has a new band...way too loud and no longer to our liking...we loved the great group that used to perform regularly and miss them. We also miss the Ballys breakfast buffet that enabled you to have choices but not overwhelmingly huge. We had reservations for the \"Sterling Brunch\" at Ballys and although a bit pricey at $75. a person, it was elegant and the food was delicious. The Del Coronado Hotel in San Diego boasts the best brunch in California and it could learn a lot from this amazing brunch at Ballys. You will not be disappointed...even the unlimited champaigne is wonderful. I have read numerous comments about the casino and the smoke issue. Compared to other casinos, the smoke seems much worse at Ballys...maybe the air is not filtered as well...but our eyes did seem to burn whenever we stayed for a while in the casino, a problem that did not happen anywhere else. The pool area is about as blah as one could imagine. The music is loud, the drinks expensive and yes, it is true that there are always enough chairs, I think because there is nothing to keep you by the pool. It is hot, no misters or shade...and it is simply a concete yard with an inground pool...nothing special in any way. Also, while gambling, the drink girls are few and far between...if you order a drink, chances are, you will have lost all your money before they return with your drink...a little annoying. All in all Ballys is OK...but nothing more. I usually stay at Paris but they did not allow for Saturday check in and 2 people in our group were joining us on Saturday morning...so we opted to stay where we all could be together... I would not stay at Ballys again...maybe if they brought back the old lounge group, opened their breakfast buffet, stopped charging to use the safe and filtered their air...not to mention that a little atmosphere at the pool would be greatly appreciated... I think Ballys needs to upgrade itself...come into the modern era.

When we arrived at Bally's to check in we were told that our request for 2 beds in a nonsmoking room could not be honored. Our choice was one bed or a smoking room. Finally, the woman at the front desk gave us a two bed nonsmoking room by the elevators in a south tower room. Once up in that room I decided that I could not sleep with the noise of the elevators so I called the front desk and talked to the manager Kit who quickly volunteered to find us a 2 bed room. He called right back and then met us in front of the check in area with the key cards to the new room in the north tower. Kit saved the day but the whole experience would have been much better if our request for a 2 bed nonsmoking room had been honored in the first place. The new room was very nice and very quiet. One note -- the check in line was very long and very slow. Several employees were walking around behind the counter but I have no idea what they were doing or what their job was. It obviously wasn't to check in guests. Also, there were two employees standing near the front of the line seemingly observing the check in line and counter.

Second, the shuttle to Rio no longer leaves from Bally's, you have to go to Paris, not a long walk, no big deal, I just don't want anyone standing in front of Bally's waiting for a bus that will never show up. Third, the deli \"Nosh\" located on the casino floor is open until at least 1:00 am so you can grab a bite to eat late without paying for room service. Fourth, you can no longer cash out your gaming tickets from Paris at Bally's, something about Paris being sold by Bally's, even the bartenders couldn't explain exactly why. Other than that everything seemed to be the same. The rooms are quite large, the staff is friendly and you can lose money here just as fast as ever.

We booked the trip through Expedia to join a group of friends already in Las Vegas for several days during the week. We travel extensively for work and pleasure and are experienced travelers. If you want an honest review read further. If offended by not being politically correct or blunt move on to another review. Hotel: This hotel is as centrally located as one can get. That being the only positive. The hotel has two towers - north and south. From the previous reviews it appears the north tower has been renovated while the south tower remains untouched since about 1985. The check-in went well, but we were turned down when we asked for a north tower room based on reading Trip Advisor. We were told that no king beds remained and that the only remaining rooms were double beds even though we booked a king. We were offered an upgrade to a junior suite for $25/night. Wanting to have the process over we accepted and were directed to the south tower - 7201. The room had a large king bed with an elevated platform with a central bathtub and other bathroom essentials. The room was in desperate need of renovation with old furnishings, a moldy shower and cracked wash basins. We had a 'wonderful' view of the back of the Paris hotel. Although it was a non-smoking room we could still smell the faint odor of smoke throughout the room and floor. Smoking: For you smokers, Las Vegas is the place to be. We come from a state that thankfully does not permit indoor smoking. Smokers are everywhere in Las Vegas, but some of the higher end casinos and hotels provide excellent smoke filtration. Not so in Bally's. The casino and hotel in general smell of smoke everwhere. Those hotels that we visited that the smokers did not bother us include Madalay Bay, NY NY, Ceasar's, Rio, and the Venetian. The Venetian and its new wing, The Palazzo, seemed to have the best filtration systems. Because of the smoke we did not use any of the hotel facilities. We traveled over to Paris and to Ceasar's for meals, gaming and to walk around. Paris has its issues too, but far less than the dated Bally's. Time Share Vultures: Travel to Las Vegas has been reduced with the downturn in the economy. One of our cab drivers said that his business was off as much as 30%. The downturn has not impacted the Time Share Vultures that lurk just inside the main entrance and to the right. The approach is friendly enough if you appear to hesitate for just a moment once inside. We simply ignored them, but at times they often blocked our path. They even were inside some of the higher end casinos although were more subtle in approach. Foreign Travelers: Welcome to Las Vegas! Again with the economic downturn there are a number of foreign travelers in Las Vegas. We have been to Europe several times and have enjoyed the sights and people we have met. We respected the countries we visited by learning the basics of the language and trying to fit in. Now to the U.S. - what angers me is when certain people travel in large gaggles on the escalators and then stop at the top in one mass group deciding where to go next. Make a decision and move on. It is likely a cultural thing, but it is frustrating none the less. Also, you will find that some do not respect the tradition of waiting your turn in line. Equally as frustrating, but we just pushed back. Overall we will be back to Las Vegas but never to Bally's.

I travel a lot - at least a few times a year so I have a basis for comparison - and my experiences always seem to be better than the reviews I read which makes me think I'm not a very picky traveler.

I didn't have any problems with the South Tower - it was clean, smelled good, big and easy to access from the casino. The bathroom worked just fine, it was quiet, housekeeping came everyday...no problems at all. The Casino was big, clean and a lot of fun. There were a couple lounges in it too that were nice to sit in - there was live music every night. They had a Sbarros pizza, a couple delis too - there were some options for people who didn't want to go broke eating. The pool was great - it gets busy and by noon-ish most chairs are gone. It was however, 100 degrees everyday we were there so that's probably why it was so busy. But, there was plenty of room for everyone - we never had a problem getting a seat. They have a DJ, bar and restaurant at the pool too. We extended our stay for 1 night and didn't have any problems at the front desk. The location was great - you could walk anywhere. We ate next door at the Flamingo, watched the fountain show at the Bellagio, rode the roller coaster at NYNY and never had more than a 10 min. walk. The only bad things: EVERYTHING costs extra - pool rafts, room safes, pretty much anything. But, that's Vegas - you don't go there to save money. All in all a great stay.

I have previously stayed at Imperial Palace and the Golden Palm (glad they tore it down). We arrived by plane and the cab fare was about $20 with tip. Very reasonable. The check-in process was smooth without any hiccups. We stayed in the \u201cGrand Suite\u201d which is in the north tower, and wow! The place was huge! The suite consisted of 3 rooms linked together with a total of 4 beds (easily enough for 8-10 people if some want to sleep on the ground). We stayed for almost a week, through the weekend and the price with a few bouts of room service was a bit under $2,000. Seems pricy, but for that long a stay, huge Jacuzzi in the main room and enough space to throw a massive after party, the price comes down fast when you have a few people chip in. (Be sure to only book the room for 2 people\u2026they will give you as many keycards as you want). The normal soaps and things were provided in each room, room was made up and fresh towels added every day. Very nice housekeeping, be sure to tip them well, at Bally\u2019s they work hard. Room service was amazing! We ate room service for dinner probably 3 nights and I was always quick and delish. Besides there is something to be said for eating a perfectly cooked steak in a Jacuzzi with your significant other. Highly recommend this option, its not really expensive (we usually spent more eating out) and the food was always perfect. Did a lot of gambling. The slots were hit and miss, but they seemed to be relatively loose compared to Paris. Biggest win was probably $80 on quarters. Tables are usually open so you can get a seat or a rail at about $10-15min. Dealers are cool, and the party pit is fun if you want to win beads, a deck of cards, or a stuffed animal for getting lucky. All in all, probably brought $800 to gamble with and left with $850. The comps however are a joke! I was at the tables everyday for about 7 hours with $20-30 average bet, at the end of the trip ended up with $4.65 in comps. Truly abysmal, no comps whatsoever thrown at me after 4 hours straight at a craps table. I asked for a free buffet and the pit boss said he couldn\u2019t do it. Mostly an older crowd here but there a few 20-somethings running around.

Overall, I just considered Bally's a place to sleep while at the Conference and in Las Vegas. Overall, the Hotel offers a great location on the strip, clean rooms, with little amenities (unless you want to pay quite a bit). I have stayed at Holiday Inn Expresses that offered more. My room was in the south tower, which apparently makes a difference in how people felt about Bally's. I talked to several other conference attendees who stayed in the south tower and did not like it while others staying in the north seemed to have a better opinion. I have posted some thoughts below. Location: The location on the strip is probably Bally's primary strength. It is centralized on the strip meaning that it is just a short walk to places like the MGM and Treasure Island. There is a sky bridge right outside Bally's, which makes it easy to get to the Bellagio and Cesars Palace. Bally's is also a stop on the Monorail line, in case you do not want to walk to the other locations. It costs about $5 a ride. Rooms: The rooms in the south tower are quite large and clean. The bathroom water pressure was good and they stock the bathrooms with shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.The elevators leading up to the rooms in the south tower were the slowest I have ever experienced. I once waited 9 minutes to have the elevator come to my floor. The beds were comfortable and the rooms had quite a bit of lamps, a table, and chairs. Lack of amenities: The hotel does not offer much in the way of in-room amenities or other services without a charge. There is no in-room complimentary coffee for example. I did not have a mini-fridge either. The in-room safe costs $3.00/day or so and it is best not to touch it. If you shut it, that is when the charges kick ensue. Workout Room: The most disappointing for me was the fact that the fitness center is not complimentary to hotel guests. A day pass to use the fitness center will cost you $22.50. Needless to say I ran the strip to get in my exercise. I was not willing to pay that much for a 45 minute workout. Food: There is a small coffee kiosk in the lobby, another small coffee shop serving sandwiches, and a 24-hour diner. The food was just okay but really expensive. It is probably better to go to the strip to get food. There is also a shopping complex downstairs with a deli, Sbarro pizza, Japanese restaurant, sports bar, Haagen Das (sp?), and New York Pretzel. There are two shops that provide sundries within the hotel. TV: If you get tired of the strip, the TV channels are really limited. Other than the basic channels, there were not much else except for a block of Chinese television channels. Hotel staff: I found the staff to be a mixed bag. Some were very helpful and some were not. I appreciated the bag storage provided by the bell captains. Check-in/Check out: When you first arrive, chances are you will have to stand in a very long line to check in. It moves relatively quickly. The hotel offers express check out. Casino: I did not gamble, however, the casino seemed a bit dated compared to others along the strip. There is quite a bit of floor space at the casino. Bally's is connected to Paris through a corridor of shops. The conference took place in meeting rooms in both facilities. I would not recommend this set up for future conferences as it was a hike to get from one session to another if you had a session starting in the other hotel. Overall, the hotel was clean but to me, there was really nothing special about Ballys, other than the location. If you want your hotel to be part of your overall Vegas experience, you may want to consider another location. If you want to use your hotel as a home base while cruising the Strip, then Bally's will suit your needs.", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWould stay there again\u201d", "Author": "cat09Ohio", "ReviewID": "UR15704900", "Content": "Great hotel for the price.

And unless you absolutely must avoid fresh air, get outside and go to Red Rock Canyon or one of the other natural wonders just beyond the outer edge of the city. Pros: Friendly staff, good food in both Bally's and Paris which is connected to Bally's. In fact, the food at a Le Provencal in Paris was excellent, as was Le Village Buffet. Nice casino with $5 tables most of the week, average decor for the strip. Excellent rooms in the North Tower (avoid the South Tower until its renovated). The pictures of my room show a damaged tub, that was probably chipped during installation, but the room really was very comfortable. Astonishingly huge property. Cons: We requested a non-smoking room when we made reservations and none were available on Saturday when we arrived. They upgrade us to a Jr. Suite, but it was still a smoking room and it was a very bad night. The smoke in the casino gets worse during the night and isn't as well filtered out as in some of the other casinos (Bellagio, Caesars, Bill's, and the Flamingo - these last two had less smoke because the casino was open to outside). Astonishingly huge property. They charge extra for *everything*! $1.25 to make a call to an 800 number, $12.99 for internet access, $22.00 per day for access to the fitness room, $3 per day for the in-room safe, everything!

This was my 9th trip to Vegas and we have stayed at Bally's 4 times. I stayed at the Flamingo 1 time, Mirage 2 times, and Excalibur 2 times. Bally's is my favorite for 3 reasons: location, large rooms, and the casino is small so the rooms are quick to get to from the entrance. They have recently closed the buffet and have moved the shuttle bus that goes to the Rio to the Paris casino. Because of this I am rating it above average instead of excellent. I do not like the restaurant food at the Paris. I'm not sure I will stay at Bally's my next trip but will never stay at the Excalibur or Mirage again. You just can't beat the Harrah's reward program, so I will stay at a Harrah's property so the comps will keep coming.

More about Bally's - Every stay the rooms have been very clean and are very big. You will love the size of the bathroom! The beds have been very comfortable. No smells or noise. I have never had a bad room. We have stayed in both the North and South towers. My son likes the North tower the best because it is close to the Sports bar which he says is Great. The service is good and the employees are very nice. I don't usually ask for anything but have requested some additional towels, etc. and they were very accommodating. There are no coffee pots in any room but I have never stayed in a hotel in Vegas were there was. I am a big coffee drinker so I hate this fact. The best about Bally's is the location. It is centrally located on the strip so you can go visit a lot of casinos easily. The casino area at Ballys is not big, so there are not a lot of slot machines.

I am sensitive to mold and upon entering the suite the first thing that hit me was the moldy smell. The outdated furnishings hit me later after I went down a short halway. I think the moldy smell was coming from the carpet which looked like it was original to the hotel's 1973 opening. The main area was a very large vaulted room with very dated flea market scratched up chairs. It also had this large fake dead looking plant protruding from an oversized tarnished silver plantholder.The bathroom was open to the bedroom with a largejetted tub built into a platform with a great view of the stip. There were also two vanity areas, a water closet with the toilet, another room with the bidet, an enclosed ahower, and two closets. The pink marble everwhere was kind of a turnoff. The bed was comfortable but as with a lot of buildings from the70's there was not great soundproofing. Although I was roung 20 floors up I was awakened a couple of times by traffic noise from below. Apparently there was s small opening in the padio door that magnified the sounds to the extent that it was almost like trying to sleep in the middle of a highway. I have a feeling they only use this room when other rooms are unavailable. The room has some great features but the carpet and some of the furnishing needs to be replaces along with soundproofing added around the windows. The tub layout kind of reminded me of Tony Montana puffing his cigar in Scarface. Fortunately when I moved to the deluxe room the next day it was a total 180 degree turn for the positive. No moldy smell, tastefful furnishings a granite topped desk as well a granite bathroom. The bead, coucn, and bench were very comfortable. If you are out late and you want something to eat just be warned that room service cuts off at midnight and the hotel does not have a 24 hour cafe as is the case with most other Las Vegas Hotels. There is a 24 hour cafe on the Paris side which gets extremely crowded as it serves both hotels. The two hotels are joined by a shopping promenade.

The two stays could not have been more different--this review is for the first stay, February 19-20. It is important to note that Bally's is essentially TWO DIFFERENT HOTELS. We were assigned a room in the SOUTH TOWER which is characterized by ancient furniture (70's style, but not retro cool by any stretch of the imagination) and unbelievably bad housekeeping. We viewed rooms on the 18th and 20th floors. We had asked for a non-smoking king room, and we were assigned a non-smoking room with two queen beds. Our first room had some sticky substance all over the flat surfaces, so we phoned the front desk and asked for another room. After an interminable slog down the endless, dark, dingy corridors littered with room service detritus, we got another room--and this one had shards of broken glass and pennies on the carpeting. We tried the front desk once more and asked if there were any \"updated\" rooms. We were told that the only rooms available in the North Tower were suites for $100 per night more, and that we basically had the best option we were going to get since the hotel was quite full. We were offered the chance to switch to a king room on the same floor the following day, if one became available. We finally gave up, went to the nearby Walgreen's and bought a giant can of Lysol disinfectant, then hoped for the best. Fortunately, the linens had been changed, but be aware that these beds do not have anything resembling a bedspread/coverlet/duvet/comforter--they have a double-sheeted blanket and a weird little strip of fabric that goes over the foot of the bed. If you like a really firm mattress, then you're in luck, but if you're used to a plush or pillow-top mattress, these beds will come as a shock. The shower had plexiglas doors instead of a shower curtain, which prove difficult to clean for even the most detail-oriented housekeeping staff, so be prepared for mold and mildew. Several tiles in the bathroom had been cracked or broken, adding to the overall shabby appearance. If you're interested in toiletries, they provide Gilchrist & Soames (although our toiletries had clearly been opened and used by the prior guests). There are no coffee makers in these rooms. As far as the carpet goes, bring slippers or an extra pair of socks to wear. You don't want your bare feet touching it. On the plus side, we had a sliver of view of the Bellagio fountains. And to be fair, with a MasterCard promotional discount, we paid about $75 per night on Travelocity (including taxes and fees)--but we learned that it's not a bargain when you buy the room, it's a bargain when you can sleep in it without wondering whether you're being exposed to something vile.

I iced the bites, becuase i had swelling and lots of itching and kept it moving, i'm on vacation, okay, then on Saturday morning, day of check out, i was awakened to sharp pain on my left forearm, my arm was itchy and i turned on the lights, looked on the bed, and there it was a bed bug, i had not seen one before, and when i called housekeeping, they confirmed what it was, asked me in a not too convincing manner that if i wanted i could report it to security to file incident report, and took the bug away in a glass cup. i was outraged, she probably thought i would not go through with reporting it. i sure did report it, and not only that, while security was in the room, my husband found another bug on the bed. I was livid, i called the front desk manager who asked me to see him on the way out, since i was checking out that same day.

We stood in the lobby and my husband's friend had his photo taken with a \"Bally Chorus Girl\". By 6:00 p.m. we were extremely frustrated. My husband and his friend went up to the desk and before you know it, we had a suite for the night. We were told that we would have to vacate in the a.m. and get another room at our rate. I started to think about having to unpack and then repack to unpack again. In the a.m. my husband went and spoke with a manager. He said we could stay in the suite for the entire three days at our original price of $158 a night. We were so pleased. We celebrated our spacious suite with our friends by having a glass of wine in the suite one lazy afternoon. They loved our room and thought we really lucked out compared to their Flamingo room. I bought a very reasonably priced wine down the street at the ABC Drugstore inside of Planet Hollywood's mall-Miracle Mile. The room itself had multiple art prints everywhere and boasted a living area, a full jacuzzi, two mirrored closets,2 mirrored sink areas, a bidet, toilet, and shower stall. We received a multitude of toiletries each day. Bally's is connected to Paris where we enjoyed their buffet 2 times. It's well worth the money. My husband had pancakes in Bally's coffee shop. A bit pricy, but beautifully presented with a flower. I had a spicy soup which was excellent. Bellagio also has a dynamite nightly buffet for $30.

We were told that they would be ready by 2pm and by 5pm we still did not have a room. So we asked for an upgrade to a Jr. Suite and by 6pm they finally had that ready. No discount was given for the inconvenience. The room was okay, but nothing spectacular. My in-laws had a regular guest room and their room was actually nicer then our suite! We had to call for housekeeping because the floors were dirty and the sink area didn't look like it had been cleaned. They never arrived and we left a note the next morning to be sure these issues we addressed. This was the first time I ever stayed at a hotel where I didn't want to walk around in my bare feet. It just felt dirty the entire time I was there. Our room had a jazucci bath which we were both excited about. That excitement was dimished the first time we used it. They only allow the water level to go so high to use it (which doesn't even come to your chest when laying down). Then the jacuzzi only worked sporadically. One night my husband wanted to use it and it just wouldn't work at all. So we called the front desk and they did send up someone to fix it (this was about 1am). After about 20 minutes, it was finally fixed, but by this point my huaband was so upset about the whole ordeal that he only stayed in it for about 10 minutes. There was also a bouday (sp?) in our room that ran all the time. Again, they sent someone to fix it, but they couldn't so we had to listen to the running water for 4 days. Upon check-out, we informed them of all of the issues while we stayed and our dissatisfaction (as we had throughout the entire stay) and nothing was done. Not even an apology.

I secured a Best Rate Garantee and see they gave me a rate of about $130 for each night when in fact new years was about $300. I had spent the earlier 4 nights in this trip at Mirage and when we checked in we were disappointed with our rooms. In spite of having booked 6 months in advance, they could not even offer us a king bed as requested. I remember speaking to an Asian lady quite short and middle aged, who was so very rude to us. I asked her if we could change from 2 single to 1 large bed, and she really shouted at me like I was nobody. I was trying to find out from her if there was any difference in the south tower (where were currently checked in) or the north tower (where she offered us a king bed after 7pm). My wife was unwell so I did not want to move her around if the room was no better. i was really put off by her, but I let it go so we could have a nice holiday. We ended up staying in the room with 2 single beds because the view was THE BEST YOU CAN GET IN VEGAS, COMPLETELY UN-OBSTRUCTED OF THE SOTH STRIP! so we decided to stay put and enjoy the evening view. Each time I ever come to vegas, for some reason we eat at Sbarro in Ballys. This time we also had pretzels and hagan das icecream, we had these BOGOF coupns so every bit helps! The restaurants are nothing great, so we ate 2 times in Paris at teh burger brasserie, very nice burgers I thought, plus hot waitress in tiny shorts! maximum price for 2 hungry people with fries and drinks is about $30, cheap! Location is decent, close enough to walk to MGM lots of tourist shops along the way, and you can buy cheap water, tourist trips, souvenirs, etc so worth a morning stroll! Overall we would have preferred to stay at a themed hotel but since Ballys gave us very good room rates, we stayed there. New years was silly, the area outside the hotel was so crowded, lots of security and this was quite dangerous with so many people. Unluckily my wife became very ill, and we had no wayy to get to a hospital so we had to walk round the back way to harmon medicla centre. When I told ballys reception my wife was ill, they sent security within 5 minutes, who spent 30 minutes with us trying to help. I was very impressed with them. What was weird was with reception next morning, I wanted a checkout for 1 pm, stating my wife needs to rest before her flights which was 4pm, but they kept messing us about, saying to call back later. I really doubt all 3000 rooms were required to be cleaned at once, they could have just let us keep the room till later.

This hotel is a favorite for gambling and staying for a lot of my friends, including a few who go to Vegas several times a year. I was looking forward to checking this hotel out, but was very disappointed. The hotel decor and furnishings, facilities, etc., are all very nice and beautifully decorated. Our king room was spacious and the rooms had clearly been renovated/redecorated so were in great condition. The bathrooms were also beautiful, with granite-type vanity, tiling, and a well-designed shower. Bad things: 1. The room hadn't been cleaned thoroughly, there was a sticky spot from a glass or other food container on the bedside table. The rest of the room, however, appeared very clean. 2. The internet is $12/day, and the business center charges a RIP-OFF rate of $8 for some short period of use and $1/page for printing in bw. 3. We had a problem with checking in (2 rooms booked at same time, 1 came up 1 didn't). The service at time of check-in sucked, and I'm not being overly critical. We weren't mean, cranky, or difficult guests, and the check-in staff seemed to be interested in how quickly they could get us out of the way to check in the next person. The first person we talked to wouldn't call Hotels.com to try and help us solve the problem, referred us to the business center (where we got ripped off to try and get access to our reservation). The second person was curt and unhelpful when we asked for the hotel fax number, so Hotels.com could refax our confirmation. It took us almost 2 hours to check-in to our room, extra inconvenient with an energetic 4-year old waiting to run amok. Once again, a sterling example of how the difference between a four star and five star hotel is service service service. I'm sure Bally's doesn't care because they have ten million other gambling guests eager to stay at the hotel, but I don't plan on ever staying there again, and I will dis-recommend it to anyone.

Have previously stayed at Mirage, NY NY, Stratosphere & Sahara. This time we chose Ballys due to it's price and location. We arrived at Ballys at 6pm as our flight was delayed. We'd booked 2 kings rooms in the North Tower. Due to our late arrival all they had were 2 twin rooms in the dreaded South Tower. We were tired so agreed to take them on the understanding that we would be moved to a king and a twin room in the North Tower the next afternoon which they were happy to arrange. We found our rooms easily and were surprised how big and clean they were. Two (UK) king sized beds in both rooms with a fantastic view of the Flamingo and Caesars. The next day we headed out onto the Strip for the day and were miles from Ballys when we should have been changing rooms. We agreed that we were happy with the rooms we'd got in the South Tower and decided to stay there. Inside Ballys we ate at the deli out the back of the property which was decent value as the sandwiches are massive. Also got my morning coffee from Nosh which is at the bottom of the South Tower lifts - overpriced but it was decent coffee and convenient. Gambled all over the strip - had great fun at Planet Hollywood & Stratosphere but ended up at Ballys in the Party Pit most evenings, as did our friends who were staying at Bellagio and Caesars. Didn't visit the pool but did see it and it looked clean and uncrowded. Drinks - the free drinks flowed in Planet Hollywood, Stratosphere and Ballys. Caesars was terrible, you could die of thirst in there! Got my nails done at the Regis Salon inside Ballys - $50 for a French manicure - still on and chip free 6 days later. The 4 of us staying at Ballys all agreed that we would stay there again - even in the South Tower!

We went so far as to call about two weeks before we were due to arrive, to insist on a North Tower room. We were told it would be $20 extra per night. We figured since we were getting 5 nights for $200 to begin with that the extra $100 was not a big deal and would be worth not being unhappy with our accomodations. Check in was a literal breeze; I hadn't put my confirmation paper back in my carry-on and we already had keys to 2226 North Tower. ( No mention of the $20 extra per night ). North Tower elevators are divided into two banks; one set for floors 6 thru 16 and another set of eight elevators for floors 17 and higher.Elevators arrived quickly no matter what time of day or night. Elevator interiors were always clean. Vending and ice machines were located as you stepped out of the elevator area on the 22nd floor.It was a bit of a trek to 2226 from the elevator , but carpeting and hallway was a lot cleaner than others had reviewed on this site. Room keys always worked first time, every time. Very rarely did room service dishes sit in the hallways for more than a few hours. Room 2226 was a standard room; two queen beds; smoking. A full mirrored closet with at least 20 wooden hangars is to your right as you walk in. The bathroom is to your right, with a granite topped vanity and granite walled shower around the tub. There were always 4 washcloths,hand towels and bath towels stocked in bathroom each day . Complimentary toiletries were shampoo, conditioner,hand lotion and face soap by Gilchrest and Soames. The room itself was at least 20% larger than the standard rooms at TI and Planet Hollywood. Two beds with no nasty comforters, a total of seven pillows and an extra blanket in the closet. Beds were very comfortable. The room had a standard armoire with a television and six drawers. There was also a standard desk AND a granite topped work station desk. Besides the three straight backed chairs at the desks, there was also a large oversized chair by the window. The windows were a little on the dirty side and the view of 2226 was of another wing of the north tower to the east, Paris tower to the south, and if you put your face against the window, you could see a partial view of the Bellagio lake and fountains to the west.Otilia was our room person for the entire stay; I never even had to leave a note asking for kleenex or more shampoo. Our hallway was a little cold the first two days, but I never heard a word from other guests. The casino was laid out with slot machines all over and tables and poker room in the middle . The newer slots were located near the registration area and the North Tower elevators, while some of the older slots were basically relegated to the southern part of the casino. They also seemed to have quite a lot of video poker machines. The inner connecting hallway takes you to another whole casino at Paris without going outdoors. A quick note: Vouchers cashed out of machines at Ballys work in the machines at Paris and vice versa. Quite convenient. We did not avail ourselves of the pool or the spa facilities. On the way to the pool and the monorail are two affordable places to eat, in addition to the four restaurants located just off the casino floor. There is another affordable eatery, Nosh, near the South Tower elevators. In the connecting hallway to Paris , there are more affordable eating options. Directly across from registration there is a Java Coast coffee and snack stand.Our room did not have a coffeemaker, so I was quite the regular at Java Coast. There is a $3 a day charge to use the in room safe, which is located inside the aforementioned mirrored closet. We were double charged for the safe on one of our five days, but Joan removed the extra charge at checkout. In room television checkout is available , but we had accumulated and graduated to platinum Total Rewards this trip, so we checked out in person. We also had a day that the safe did not open, but it only took 6 to 7 minutes for someone to come and remedy that. Across Flamingo road ,next to Battista's Hole in the Wall Italian restaurant, is a convenience store that had liters of water for 79 cents!!! I believe the water available in the room was $4 a liter bottle. The five nights that we stayed were Mon 10/22 thru Sat 10/27. The hotel and casino were busier early in the week and quieter later in the week due to high volume conventions. Everywhere else we've ever stayed on a Mon thru Sat stay, has been quiet early in the week building to a crush on Friday night. Sign up for and use a players club card when you gamble, because a percentage of money gambled at Paris/Ballys/Flamingo/Harrahs/Caesars and Rio can be used towards room charges at check-out.We ended up getting all 5 nights for free due to this system and were never charged the quoted $20 upgrade charge for the North Tower. All in all I would give this stay a solid B+, only missing an A, because there is not a 24 hour restaurant in Ballys proper ( there is a 24 hour restaurant in Paris ) and the common area bathrooms were a little worn for wear.The staff from checkin through checkout were friendly and accomodating.", "Date": "October 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWhat a nice experience\u201d", "Author": "biusas", "ReviewID": "UR10384788", "Content": "My wife and I are approaching retirement age (70 & 64), and found that our 5 night stay in October at Bally's was a perfect fit.

We have never stayed in a quieter room, which was a relief from the craziness of the casino. Not a peep from neighbors or the corridor. And contrary to what we were told when we booked, there was indeed a coffee maker in the room. The staff without exception was pleasant and friendly, including valet attendants, dealers, waiters, etc. The location is tops, and I don't think can be beaten on the Strip. The price was fair ($550 for 5 nights before taxes). The only cons were minor: no grab bar in the tub/shower, very dirty windows impeding the great view, and tight comps in the casino.

Originally, we made reservations at Caesars but the hotel was overbooked upon arrival because of a convention that was in-town. In lieu, the staff offered us free accommodations across the street at Bally's [another Harrah's property]. In the beginning things did not start off well. We originally requested the premium palace tower room at Caesars. The staff promised us \"comparable or better\" if we moved to Bally's. Of course, when we arrived at Bally's they had two regular guest rooms waiting for eight guys. When we informed the desk clerk at Bally\u2019s what Caesars had promised she looked at us like we were crazy people visiting from MARS. To add insult to injury, the Bally's desk clerk called the front desk at Caesars to confirm whether or not what we were saying was true. The clerk who had helped us at Caesars must have suffered a memory lapse [in the thirty minutes that had passed] because Bally\u2019s was not going to honor the promise. As a compromise the Bally\u2019s clerk offered us a similar room at a 50% room rate. After an hour of arguing we finally wore them down to give us the room they originally promised. Thank god because after seeing their premium room I would have been extremely upset to pay what they were asking given the dated motif. Once we got settled things got better and overall the stay was pleasant. Although Bally\u2019s Las Vegas would not be in my top pick of places to stay the accommodations were very clean and the view from the room was terrific. If you\u2019re a pool person this is not the place for you. The pool at Bally\u2019s is a nice place to grab a cocktail and sit in the sun for a while if you want to escape the tables. At night the floor seemed refined for older players and the sports book was okay. In the evening we spent more time at the Hard Rock than Bally\u2019s which hosts a younger and more energetic clientele. This was my second stay at Bally\u2019s so I don\u2019t mind staying there but would prefer elsewhere.

This also made taking decent photos from them impossible. We asked for and were given rooms in the North Tower. They are nice and clean. Nothing to get excited about, but good enough. Strange TV lineup in the hotel room. Several were cable channels from China, most of which did not have any English subtitles, so I had no idea what was going on. Medium-sized tube TV with a channel picture quality that ranged from decent to poor. None were razor sharp. Casino staff and cocktail waitresses were very friendly. Elevators ran fast and smoothly. It was a loooooong walk from my hotel room to the Monorail Station and the pool. Good thing I'm in decent shape and had new gym shoes. Plenty of restaurants and small shops to buy snacks or supplies. As usual in Las Vegas, Internet kiosks are overpriced. Web browsing speed not as fast as I would have liked. Tunnel connecting Bally's with Paris Hotel was neat and convenient. The Strip entrance to Bally's has a very long escalator you can use to enter the casino, which is great for tired feet. As dozens have already mentioned, Bally's central Strip location is very nice and handy.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location for the Strip\u201d", "Author": "nunyakhOklahoma", "ReviewID": "UR10056284", "Content": "This is the first time we've stayed on the Las Vegas Strip in about four trips.

The Margarita Bar was a good place for a really tasty margarita and some great nachos. Two drinks and an order of nachos was $32.00 - not just a drop in the bucket. Drink service while gaming isn't nearly as frequent as it used to be and the cost of a drink at the bar has become exorbitant. The bands they booked were really entertaining - music from the 50's through current. We thoroughly enjoyed them. We will likely try another spot the next go round. We're most fond of the downtown area, though. Things are more reasonably priced (or were last time we went) and I never tire of the Freemont Street Experience.

We got the towers mixed up at check in - we had read that we should ask for the south tower, as we should get a view of the Bellagio and the rooms were more modern, but we asked for the north tower by mistake. However, the room was lovely. We had a view of the Wynn and the Stratosphere. Only criticism is that the windows outside had not been cleaned and were very dirty. The couple we went with were across the corridor from us, and hence had a view of the back of the Paris hotel - not brilliant, but for the amount of time spent in the room (ie sleeping and therefore minimal in Sin City!) it wasn't too bad. All the themed hotels are within walking distance of Bally's (although you may be too tired to walk back!!) The shape of Bally's isn't too confusing unlike the big hotels on the tripod basis.

The reviews are a bit mixed on this site so here's my two cents geared for making an informed choice: This property is nicer aesthetically than Rio, Harrahs, and Flamingo--which are also owned by the giant Harrah's Entertainment. It is way nicer and cleaner than many of the other vegas strip casinos that cater to budget travelers. Conversely, it is a very small step behind Treasure Island. The casino itself is large and clean and most of the restaurants are above average in decor. You do definitely want a North Tower room as these have all been renovated. I have never stayed in the South tower. The biggest drawback of this resort is the pool area--very dated and way behind the majority of glitzy vegas pools. So obviously, this isn't an issue at all in the winter months but could be annoying in the summer. The gym is a bit small but adequate. The property has a very large sportsbook with lots of TV's that is located adjacent to the food court so is very popular during football season. What are the best things about Bally's? I'm surprised that I have never heard anyone say this on this site, but staying at Bally's is pretty much like staying at TWO hotels! This is because there is a large hallway off the main casino floor that connects you directly into the Paris Hotel which is very ritzy and upscale. Since both resorts are owned by Harrah's, you can go eat in Paris and have it charged to your room at Bally's. When it's 110 degrees outside or there is a thunderstorm outside you have no idea how convenient this connecting hallway is! The other great things are the rooms in the North Tower which are about 450 sq. feet (larger than average) They are comfortable and clean and the resort usually offers rates that are about 20-30% cheaper than other Strip resorts. I do not think that the ambiance of this resort, especially when combined with the usage of Paris, deserves an average 3 star rating; I would say it's just a tad shy of 4 stars because the South Tower hasn't been renovated and the pool. If the Bally's restaurants don't meet your expectations simply walk a couple hundred yards, indoors, and you will have all the glitz and glamour of Paris--Mon Ami Gabi, The Eiffel Tower Restaurant (amazing!) and some terrific cafe's and quaint spots. Paris has a great feel to it because it is much smaller than many mega hotels--so it feels cozy and not overwhelming--it lends itself to a feeling of romance. There is a great spot located right in the hallway between the two resorts that is a \"dueling piano bar\". They serve champagne and the talented pianists take requests from the audience--it's very fun and a great meeting spot or place to kill a couple hours in the evening or after dinner perhaps. Bally's has a terrific center of the strip location; very close to Bellagio and Caesar's Palace.

The room turned out to be a regular king bed room facing Bill's (no upgrade in my book). The decor in the lobby and the casino is bland and boring - a theme which Bally's carries throughout the rest of the hotel. Our room was average size with comfortable beds and the regular lotions, soaps and shampoos in the bathroom. I was suprised at how nice the pool area was: although it is REALLY far away from the hotel. There is a super-giant \"hot tub\" next to the pool, which really looks like an old kiddie pool with some luke warm water. The pool bar was very nice (drink prices were high as usual). You get to see the monorail upclose - as it passes almost right over the main pool area. There were quite a few folks in the 60+ range - I think that this must be who Bally's really appeals to. Entering Bally's from LV Blvd. is a waste of time - they have this double football field length people mover that takes 10 minutes to ride before you get to the hotel - enter fom the side it is much faster. The location is great - as it is in the middle of everything on the strip. The Jubilee is a Vegas tradition that you have to see once. It has been running for 25 years and is a huge production of dancing, singing and acrobatics. The Diamond lounge at Bally's is closed, but the Paris casino's lounge is right down the corridor and is a great lounge. Also check out Napoleon's dueling pianos down that hallway. It is free to come in and the entertainment is great. Finally, I would just say that we found Bally's very average in every way except location.

I ate at the Steakhouse in the hotel and the service was surprisingly good, very good in a European smother the customer like way. I felt a little like a rat packer in the dark dining room getting yes sirred and not a problem sirred all night. The food was much better than expected. I had the shrimp cocktail, beefsteak salad and petit filet - all prepared and served perfectly. I'd give the restaurant a solid 4 star rating, not fancy 5 star, but definitely worth looking at as in casino restaurants go - especially with it's old Vegas feel and charm, would be good for a romantic tryst in a booth too. The coffee bar in the lobby was OK, always 30 deep people in line. The casino itself is not as large or flashy as most in Vegas but has its own special feel. I would probably not stay at Bally's if I could stay at Mirage, Treasure Island or Paris for a comparable price (based on location) or if not concerned with price would have preferred to have stayed at Mandalay/Hotel or Bellagio. I would not use Bally's for a guy/gals weekend base as it is really not as hip or in the mainstream as the other hotels close to it.", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cSo, so experience\u201d", "Author": "NJdudette", "ReviewID": "UR8592623", "Content": "I was a bit disappointed by this hotel. The outside appearance of this hotel is a bit worn and in my opinion is in need of an overhaul. I did think the staff was more than helpful and went out of their way to welcome me to their hotel; it was simply the property itself I wasn\u2019t wowed by. I was waited on fairly quickly at Bally\u2019s since I\u2019m a Platinum member and for grins I requested a room upgrade. I was told a spa suite (North Tower room #833) was available for an extra $100/night charge \u2013 I quickly went for it. What I didn\u2019t realize was that I would be charged $100/night for each of my two comped nights and an additional $100 for the night I was already paying for ($85 + $100) \u2013 my stupid mistake so I really can\u2019t complain too much. The room was decorated nicely and a good size for one or two people. The first problem I noticed was the room location \u2013 I was on the eighth floor and just above Flamingo Road \u2013 yup, lots of traffic all night long. I\u2019m a rather heavy sleeper so I figured it wouldn\u2019t bother me - I was wrong. I should have requested room change, but I was only staying for three nights and didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of re-packing and then un-packing again. In addition, I discovered on the last night that the spa didn\u2019t work \u2013 I should have said something upon check-out, but for whatever reason I chose not to - mistake number three. Oh yes, the shower stall had an awful smell and there was mold in each of the corners. I sprayed Febreeze and tried airing the shower out, but all I managed to do was stink up the rest of the room. The safe also didn\u2019t work and when I called down to the front desk to have someone look at it they said I needed to wait for maintenance, I had plans and couldn\u2019t wait so I told them I\u2019d call back. I never got around to calling them back. All and all the room was ok, but I thought it was a tad bit beat up. I thought the North Tower was recently upgraded? It\u2019s highly unlikely I\u2019d stay there again as I like a few of the other Harrah properties a lot more. The pool was a bit of a walk from the elevators, but I could always use some exercise <LOL>. Make no mistake, you will not visit Bally\u2019s for their pool scene, it\u2019s non-existent, but large enough to hang for a couple of hours and relax. The pool itself is in bad shape, it\u2019s in serious need of general maintenance. The pool decking is faded and in need of painting and the pool itself is somewhat of a hazard. The paint around the edges has chipped/worn away in certain areas where people could cut themselves or stub a toe. The hand railings were very loose/wobbly and I was nervous that one of the kids would get hurt while swinging/hanging on it (hence the reason it\u2019s wobbly). Many of the chairs were broken and it became irritating as the day went on and the pool became more crowded \u2013 searching for a working chair was a pain in the butt to put it mildly. Like most pools the drink prices were exorbitant and there were only two waitresses on staff, although, I think they did a fairly good job keeping everyone hydrated. Harrah\u2019s can do much better with this pool area. Bally\u2019s version of the infamous Vegas buffet: Big Kitchen Buffet is nothing to rave about. In many ways it reminded me of the buffet at the Flamingo. Not so much in appearance as in food choices. The food wasn\u2019t bad by any means, just nothing to write home about. The waitstaff was extremely friendly and very attentive to my needs.

I stayed at the Bally's from 8/23 to 8/26. I met my girlfriend at the airport since we both flew from different cities, and 2 friends of mine had already checked in that same day at the Bally's. The first thing that I asked him is \"what tower did you get?\" and he said \"South\" and he also said that he requested that I'd be given a room in the same floor as they. After reading all the reviews of the feared south tower I freaked out, because I did a lot of research about both towers and even printed photos of both towers to show the staff when I'd check in. I arrived at the airport at aorund 6 pm and didn't find the \"Airport Check-in\" that I read so much about, so I just decided to go straight to the hotel and do it there. I got there, and there is a huge line of people checking in, so I freaked out a little because it was already late and I didn't want to lose anymore time. Staff was so efficient that I was in line roughly 10 minutes. When I was checking in, the lady told me that my friend requested that I'd get my room in the same tower, and I told her about my research of how I'd read that the North was a lot better. She told me that North Tower is INDEED better. So I asked her if I could get a room there, and no problem. The room was absolutely gorgeous. It was huge, clean, modern, had a bar....just amazing! When my friend saw it got pissed at me, because he said that my room was A LOT better than his. They even offered to move him to the North Tower, but he was lazy to move his stuff so he stayed in the South Tower. Elevators were so quick I don't think I ever waited over 1 minute to get one. Pool was big, no problem finding beds for the 4 of us, filled with young beautiful party people....I think is the first pool that I've ever seen without kids. There's a ton of little fast food restaurants.....not the fancy type, but good enough for grabbing something to eat at 5 am. The casino is filled with old people though that didn't bothered me because none of us like to gamble. Staff was friendly. Walking distance from the coolest hotels. I checked out the last day using the TV in my room, so I didn't waste a second checking out. I would definetly stay at Bally's again. The price was just a bit over the cheap hotels in the Strip, but we definetly got a lot more for our money.

I think the agent upgraded me anyway as she told me she was putting me in the North Tower. I read on this site to try to stay in the North Tower and when I inquired the agent confirmed the North Tower is the better one. I was amazed by the size and decor of the room I received for the price! Very comfortable and was a great view from the 24th floor. Very central location on the Strip and that alone pretty much makes it worth considering Bally's - though admittedly location isn't everything. If you're room isn't clean and comfortable, location probably doesn't matter much. Yes, Bally's does overcharge and nickel-and-dime for just about everything, which I suppose helps make up for the low room price. Room service and restaurants are very expensive to what you get - you're in a tourist market and have to decide if the convenience is worth the extra cash. You will have to pay for use of the in-room safe; I guess you'll have to consider if it's worth the $3/day to use the safe. Yes, the bottle of water in the room is $4 if you take it or drink it; walk down the hallway to the machine and save $2. Ultimately, Bally's isn't doing anything every other hotel is doing and I personally just accept these things as part of my vacation funds. However, I also am usually inclined to find alternatives - they're out there if you look. Room was always well cleaned by housekeeping, though I also made sure to leave a $2 tip/day. I've found just a few bucks isn't that much to a vacation budget and makes for a great stay. If you're going to spend money on a vacation, is it that big a deal to leave a few bucks for someone to clean after you, especially if it makes for a better stay?

But, sadly, by the end, we all realized for the flight distance, that Vegas isn't much better than Atlantic City. Plus, the slots are super tight. My dad is willing to pour money into the machines, so it isn't that he plays $20 and expects to win thousands. As far as Bally's is concerned, the hotel is nice - if you stay in the North Tower. I read bad things about the South Tower but can't say it is true, as both of us got to stay in the North Tower. Unfortunately, the front desk clerk my husband and I had wanted us to pay $100 extra for this \"upgrade\". Luckily, my parents were being waited on right beside us and their clerk told them they could stay in the North Tower for free. When I heard this, I informed our clerk, who didn't seem too happy about this, but relented and put us in the North Tower. The rooms were very nice, bathroom nice, toiletries replenished daily. I do feel Vegas nickels and dimes you for anything they consider an add-on. Bally's charged us $3.00 per day for use of the safe. They know everyone is going to use it, so it is just a money maker for them. We joined the gym for 4 days, which cost us $65 per person. The gym is okay for a few days, not the greatest, but they did provide water, juice, apples and bananas in the spa. You could also use the spa free of charge - the showers, toiletries, steam room, dry sauna, and 2 jacuzzis. The connection to Paris was nice but the hallway back and forth was so crowded with people, it made it very difficult to walk through at times. The food is WAY overpriced - $4.00 for a bottle of water in your room, $3.00 for coffee, $10 for a few pieces of lettuce, etc. We ate at Bally's buffet, it was adequate for a night, especially with the $5/off per person coupon we had. We ate at Le Burger, which was overpriced for burgers, but they were good. The Carnival buffet at Rio was huge and good, plus we had another $5/off coupon. The seafood buffet at Rio was $37/per person and the line was huge. I guess it would be worth it if you love lobster, for us, it wasn't worth the line or the cost. The best deal we found was a block down from Ballys at Ellis Island. We walked there for breakfast after our first day of eating at the Sidewalk Cafe at Ballys. For eggs and coffee, our bill was $60, so I knew we had to find an alternative. Ellis Island was it - they have french toast for $2.95, a 10 oz sirloin, eggs, toast and potatoes for $6.95. They also have a NY strip, eggs, toast, and potatoes for $3.95, but this was smaller and a little fatty. The 10 oz sirloin was all meat and very good quality. Coffee is also only $.95 here. We lounged around the pool at Bally's every day - they provide towels free of charge. The chairs are a little old and uncomfortable, but it was so hot the week we were there, we made the best of it and only stayed out 2 hours at the most. The drinks are way overpriced around the pool. We also got free tickets to see Jubilee as we signed up for the Total Rewards card. The show was okay, the little acts in between the major acts were the best. I wouldn't pay money to see this show.

I've never had to wait to do this at any other hotel (vegas or otherwise) but this process took over 15 minutes---just to drop off bags. They bellhops seemed confused.

What I really liked though is there is a side door on the low level (where the shops are) which puts you literally across the street from a convenience store, a decent \"blue collar\" bar, and Battista's hole in the hole (recommend highly for dinner). The same set of doors puts you about a 7 minute walk from Ellis Island Casino (when you want to get some \"old vegas\" feel) and the Westin Causarina --4 minute walk--which has some really good happy hour gambling. I'd stay here again but only if I got a good rate and only if it was a boys trip--i don't think I'd stay here with my wife.

We asked for help from other employees with no one responding. Now we were steaming as we had tickets to Spamalot. We hauled our own 4 bags to our room in the SOUTH tower. What a haul! Upon entering our room , we noticed a large trash bag next to the door. When we walked in it looked like my 90 year old grandmothers bedroom, and furniture to match! Then we noticed the hole in the wall, peeling wallpaper and a \" large paint bubble\" above the bathtub. We headed for the show out the front entrance and observed several bellman standing around. We mentioned about the side entrance, they laughed! Upon returning late and very exhausted we headed to the room, observed the same trash bag next to the door. We had several other issue's to include a stale stagnant (nasty) odor when entering Bally\"s, front escalotors not working, dirty slot machines, cig. butts everywhere, very poor housekeeping and a staff that did not seem to care about guest service. The manager that we spoke to (Jose) gave us the same care free attitude as rest of the staff. He made us fell like we were just another complainer! The bag of trash next to our door lasted until we thru it out. We are shocked how this property has received favorable reviews in the past, it is a very nasty hotel. We walked thru several other hotels along the strip and noticed a huge improvement in housekeeping. In addition, room rate's and location are very comparable. Do not make the mistake that we did by staying at Bally's!", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore MD", "Title": "\u201cNice public areas, but rooms are raggedy\u201d", "Author": "Kaseyj1313", "ReviewID": "UR8407523", "Content": "I took my first trip to Las Vegas for a convention August 6 through 11, 2007. The convention hotel was Bally's, so I stayed there for five days. The hotel room was a big disappointment. Bally's public areas are relatively nice -- full of slot machines, gaming tables and Keno sites, plenty of high end shops, and lots of restaurants, ranging from coffee shops and donut kiosks to expensive steakhouses. But the rooms (at least in the South Tower, where I stayed) are very much down at the heels. The carpeting in the hallways is a dull and stained putrid brown. The rooms are large, but most of the space is wasted. The furnishings look like Goodwill rejects. The rooms are dark, with brown carpeting and circa 1950s chairs, end tables and dressers. Instead of a proper desk with a wheeled chair, there is a small, round, badly scratched and marked dining table and two mismatched dining chairs. On the table is the high-speed Internet connection (more about that later), awkwardly located for plugging in one's laptop. There were only two electric outlets in the wall near the table, so I had to plug my cell phone charger into another poorly located plug next to the dresser. The two lounging chairs were too soft to sit in comfortably. Lighting was also poorly located, with not enough light anywhere in the room. It was hard to work on my laptop or to read in bed. The inadequate lighting just added to the dreariness of the room. My room had a view of Caesar's Palace and the Flamingo. The king-size bed was about the right firmness for me. The 27-inch TV was not on a swivel table, so there was no way to change its position to watch from the lounging chairs. It was watch from the bed or don't watch at all (when the TV worked). During my first night, the television did not work, apparently a hotel-wide problem, according to the front desk. The bathroom was clean, with ceramic tile and soap, lotion, shampoo and conditioner, with enough towels for one person; I fear two would be caught short. I was shocked to find that the hotel charges $11.99 per 24 hours for broadband Internet access. Many hotel chains these days are offering free high-speed Internet access, and often it's wifi. To charge so much for what most people will only use a few hours is simply gouging, IMHO. I ate at the Big Kitchen Buffet most times. For $19.99 at dinner, and $12.99 for breakfast, one can pig out on American, Japanese and Chinese foods. It was not the best buffet I've ever had, but the selection was broad, and the quality was higher than, say, Golden Corral. The dessert selection was awesome, with flan and bananas Foster, assorted cookies, cheesecake, ice cream and cakes. There is a news stand, several all-night sundries and snacking places at which one can purchase sodas, bottled water and snacks. Despite my unhappiness with the room, the hotel seemed to be a good place to hold a convention. The meeting rooms were spacious and conveniently located; the staff was helpful; and the food provided at the receptions was tasty and plentiful. The hotel itself is on the Strip, and has a monorail stop. It is walking distance to many popular casinos and restaurants, and is attached to the Paris. There is a shopping mall nearby. I would not stay at Bally's again. I realize that many people visiting Vegas only use their rooms for sleeping and showering. But if you are a business traveler who needs to check e-mail daily, who would like to catch the news on TV, who would like a free newspaper every morning, and who craves bright, functional surroundings, skip this hotel.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201clovely rooms\u201d", "Author": "crosspatch", "ReviewID": "UR8400189", "Content": "Again we found it just as cheap to get in touch with the hotel directly and we didn't have to put any money up front,also if you had to cancel you could do so without losing any money.

Myself, my wife and 15 year old child. This was our first trip to Vegas but we do a lot of travelling overall. Pluses: Centrally located on the strip. Take a cab to and from the airport if there are 2 or more people rather than a shuttle its cheaper and you'll get there faster. The lobby is bright and large. I liked the marble finish all over the place....very nice. There is a small concession infront of the main checkin counter to grab a snack or a drink. This was convenient especially when coming back to the hotel and you felt you needed a water or something. Check in staff were very accommodating. I wanted a North Tower room and they found one for me although I had to wait for an hour for the room to be made up. I dropped my cell phone getting out of a cab at about 2 a.m. and the valet services found it and turned it into security. I was very grateful to get it back so quickly. Huge room, nice comfortable beds and pillows. I don't like those big bouncy pillows....these ones were just right. Nice shower. Large soaps and lots of shampoo and conditioner. They even supply mouthwash. We loved the little strip mall between Bally's and the Paris. We ate in the restraunts and delli in this mall several times. We also ate at Bally's buffet twice, lunch once and dinner once. Almost the same spread each time. We enjoyed it both times. Our elevator was quick. We were on the 16th floor and it was the first stop for that set of elevators so we always got to the room quickly. Check in was quick, check out was very quick. Minuses: I never considered safety as an issue until our fourth night. A well enough dressed guy followed me off the elevator onto the 16th floor and stopped me and proceeded to tell me a story about not having his wallet because it was in his friends rental car which was now at the airport and he was desperate for cab fare. He said his friends were now in the air, his wallet in the glove box of a rental car and he was all alone and had no way of getting his ID. He was a very good con artist and needed $40 to get a taxi. There should be a security door to the elevators that only card carrying guests can pass by! The room smelled and I finally figured out why. The airconditioning outflow is too close to the carpet and condenses leaving a puddle of water directly under it. If you're not wearing shoes you'll get soaked. You don't have to be a biologist to know there has to be mold and fungus growing under such conditions. Room safe was too costly considering I paid way more than the $58 I saw in other postings! I paid $138, $105, $105,$169, $190. Wednesday and Thursday where the $105 nights. Sat was the $190. I think I could have easily stayed at a better hotel if I shopped arround. The internet sucked.

Large, old, faded plush carpet, stained velour sofa, 70's era bedspread. You get the picture.

You have to talk through a bit of the casino, but it's not extreme like the MGM. Indeed, one other overall plus to being at Bally's is it simply doesn't feel like a zoo environment, as I suspect that most of the people in the casino are people staying in the hotel. Because it doesn't have all the shops of Bellagio, Caesar's, or Wynn, the crowds aren't too bad (granted, I was there on a Sunday-Tuesday, in August -- not peak times).

We stayed at Bally's from July 31st to Aug 3rd. When we arrived (about 9pm), there was no line up and check in was quick. Due to the later arrival, there weren't any non-smoking rooms available so they upgraded us to a \"junior\" suite on the sixth floor. Essentially, it's about twice the size of the regular room but with a murphy bed. I would have preferred a king size but it wasn't a problem. We didn't have a view, well unless you like the view of the monorail. The room was clean and quite comfortable. Some issues we had included: a very loud a/c system, a hair dryer that blew up and very slow service to fix it (called 2x and then had to go to the front desk to complain), a dirty glass with ashes left by housekeeping, and noise carried easily at night from the main suite next door. That night, we ate at the Tequila Bar. It was decent food - I thoroughly enjoyed my mojito. Altogether with dinner, drinks and a tip, it cost us about 20$. We also ate breakfast at the Sidewalk Cafe. Decent food but nothing too overwhelming. We often used the monorail to get from one end of the Strip to the other so that was a nice convenience. The casino was your typical casino but it seemed more smoky than the others I've been to. Also, the waitresses weren't as friendly nor as apt to return. As a result, we played the slots at the Paris more often - less smoke and quick bar service. The fact that it's connected to the Paris is the major bonus.

The reason I stayed at Bally's was because it's convention center hosted the trade show my $60Billion dollar company was participating in. I have traveled extensively in numerous hotels across the world from Istanbul to Islip and this was one of the worst I have ever stayed at. What I liked: The room was large. What I did not like: 1) Dirty room (dusty furniture and moldy shower tiles) with furniture that looked like it was from the Salvation Army! This was the type of room that made me want to sleep with my shoes on! 2) Rude service 3) Ask for a renovated room, BUT be forewarned my room was so raggedy that I asked for a renovated room and the guy at the front desk said I would have to pay $20 more...a small price to pay given I was on corp. expense, but it was the principle so I refused. 4) Don't believe the pics...at the front desk they have a portfolio of illlustrated pictures of the rooms and mine in the south tower looked nothing like what was shown. 5) My last day here (today 7/14), I decided to go to the pool following the end of our trade show and witnessed a scene out of MTV Spring Break. with drunk 30 somethings falling all over each other. Within 15min. they closed the pool because there was a skirmish and some drunk guy puked in it and the life guards indicated it would not reopen for :45 min. as chlorine levels were too low. I asked a pool waitress if I could get a beer and she rudely indicated they were no longer serving drinks, I would have to go to the bar. 6) The fitness center/spa is a dump. The worst I have ever seen with trash in cup holders, dark and in the basement and you have to pay $22 to use it! 7) The casino looks like something out of a 70's movies set. 8) The elevators were technically challenge, at times I would press the down button and would have to hold it continously to get an elevator. One time I had an elevator on my floor that refused to close its doors until I held down the door close button continuously while pressing the \"lobby\" button. 8) \"The Big Kitchen Buffet\" restaurant was so dirty, you did not even have to go far to eat, just grab a plate and chances were there was enough left over food on it to feed you with out even hitting the buffet!

It is unbeleivable how a customer could pay the same rate for two totally differnt style rooms. I also felt it was a gender issue that they ignored me and responded to a mans request to be moved. The hotel pool was nice but it sure felt like spring break on Sat. afternoon. Loud music by a DJ and drunk screaming people everywhere. The hotel is conncted to the Paris Hotel which is nice. There was a great restaurant on a side street next to Bally's called Battista's Hole in the Wall. For about $20 a person you get a full meal plus unlimited carafets of wine.

The hotel is in the most central location and the staff could not have been any friendlier.

However, we were given our choice of three room types upon arrival. Our room was in the North Tower and was very clean. It had a single queen bed, a dining table and 4 chairs, a smaller table w/ 2 chairs, a couch, chair, desk and coffee table. It also had a desk, fridge dressing area and large bathroom. Internet was available for $11.99/day but only worked the first 3 of the 5 days we were there. Now for a complaint - we called and were told they would come up but did not. Had we been there any longer, we would have called again. The only other complaint might be that housekeeping was way too eager to clean the room daily. For those who tend to be overly critical - Yes, this hotel is showing a little wear. Mostly in the hallway areas where the carpet is starting to look a little worn. Also, the wallpaper design is out of date. Neither of these are a bid deal for us. We don't look for perfection in a place we do not own (nor paid top dollar for). We are more concerned with cleanliness, location and staff friendliness. We have stayed at several other hotels (some higher end) and I just can't complain about this one any more than any of the others I have stayed at. The Indigo bar in the casino had excellent Motown type bands nightly which was very enjoyable to listen too.

This hotel is adequate in that you are in a good location for visiting the other hotels on the strip. We only stayed here as we got a great deal to visit Las Vegas as a two centre holiday with New York. Trouble is, we dont gamble and had our two year old son with us so we needn't have bothered with Las Vegas at all! It really is only suitable for those who want to play the machines night and day or spend time at the bar all day! I found the whole experience pointless. We visited most of the other hotels within a day and a half and, especially as the weather was awful, found very little else to do. Bally's is like most of the other hotels on the strip in that it is dark and smoky and of course, full of gamblers. Our room was huge, that was one bonus. Our son enjoyed running up and down the room more than anything else. We did have a view of the \"Eiffel Tower\" at the next door Paris hotel which was nice and were close enough to watch the fountains at the Bellagio each evening. We were unable to go in any area where alcohol was served with our son as they are so strict on the under age drinking....not that he was going to have a stiff whisky or anything! So we only indulged in around two beers drank hastily in the lobby area the whole holiday. The pool was small and not in use. The breakfast at the Buffett Venue was very good, never seen such a huge choice. Eggs any style, fish, meat, fruit, yoghurt, breads, cheeses....you name it. My husband took full advantage and ate his way through around 14 eggs benedict in 4 days. The dinner in the Buffett venue was also very good. Every type of dish available, huge king prawns, as many as you could eat.

We have been traveling to Las Vegas once or twice a year since 1973 and have stayed at many hotels there. We have stayed at Bally's for the last few years because of price, location, and quality. Our days are usually spent at the pool and the evenings are usually spent gambling and seeing a show. We have always been pleased with the rooms at Bally's and, also, the pool area where we never have any trouble finding chairs. That's the background. Now, as for this year...we checked in at the airport on Sunday, around 6pm. I had requested a king bed, high floor, north tower. The person checking us in said, \"no problem, I have a nice room with a sitting area on the 21st floor\". I asked if it had a king bed and she said yes. So I thought that there was no problem. I was wrong. The room was large and it did have a nice sitting area. The bed was a small queen size murphy bed that was pulled down from the wall. There was a kitchenette on one side of the room and a door to a connecting room on each side. I realized that this was the living room area of a suite. This was totally unacceptable so we called the front desk to complain. They said that the hotel was totally sold out and we could change tomorrow. I then went down to the front desk to speak with them personally. They said we could switch to a room with 2 queen beds on the 19th floor tonight and then they would give us a king bed room with a really nice view the next day. We could stay in our room and check in to the new one between 1-6. I asked if she knew exactly which floor and room that would be on and she said yes, the 16th floor. OK, we switched to the room with the two queens for the night. The next day, on our way back from the pool around 3:30, we made the switch to the new room. However, it was not the room with a view that we were told we were getting, it was a room on the 14th floor with a view of Paris and the parking lot. When I complained that I didn't get what was promised to me, I was told that the people had not checked out of the room that we were supposed to have. OK, at least we had a king bed which was comfortable. The pillows were small though, and, after staying at hotels in other cities who have upgraded their bedding, I think It's time that Bally's gets with the times. A corner of one of the chairs in the room had stuffing coming out of it. Our major complaint were the drapes which did not block the lights at night all along the top. Maybe they were hung too low. Also, the windows were filthy. The room was nice and large. The bathroom was nice and clean. Towels were very thin. This bathroom had a makeup mirror attached to the wall that I could adjust and that was great. The showerhead was OK, needs updating. Never a long wait for the elevator. Now as for the pool area, we had no problem getting chairs. However, we had to spend some time looking for ones that weren't broken. We were there last year at the same time and the water was warmer. this year, both pools were cold. It still felt good. The last day we were at the pool felt like kids day. The smaller pool is the \"jacuzzi\" with room for 50 people. Unfortunately, some parents use it as the kiddie pool and there were a ton of kids in there on rafts, floats, or just splashing each other. Their parents could not have cared less at what their kids were doing.

It took him nearly 2 hours of talking and waiting around for the problem to be resolved. The part of the South Tower we were in was not as bad as some people make it out here on TripAdvisor -- the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. (On a non-smoking floor) We reserved a cabana by the pool for Saturday -- when we arrived they said they had 'left messages' for us saying that 'we were bumped for a 7 star' (which I assumed was a high roller) ---this was the one thing I was really looking forward to for my bachelor party and they told us, in those words 'we were bumped'. We waited for about 20 minutes for a manager that never came down to speak to us and hopefully offer us some kind of compensation -- then we were told they had made a mistake and then walked us to our cabana. Okaaay. Thanks for wasting our time!

Fortunately, the room did not smell like smoke so that part was OK. When I checked downstairs the next morning real early, they did have king non-smoking rooms available but my husband and I decided not to move rooms, as it is a hassle, and it did not smell bad. I think I learned from this that even though they have available what you have requested, if you have booked it at their really good hot deals rate, they will tell you at check in there is not that kind of room available and try to make you pay more for a nicer room.

It was a HUGE room, but there was very little furniture and no desk. We were here for a work convention - and had two laptops that needed a spot. The bathroom was pretty much IN the room - with a big tub in the middle and stairs leading up to it. It was odd - very outdated, but I was fine. Then I took a shower (it was behind the tub) and since the bathroom was in the room, there was no steam buildup and it was cold in the room, but hot with the water. I didn't like this at all. The shower was also dirty looking. Then a motion light triggered since the tub was up a few stairs. My husband gets up a lot in the night, and the light kept waking me up. After one night, I was done. We asked to move rooms. We moved to the South tower, where we stayed last year. The rooms are very nice, new and remodeled and large. I was much more comfortable, and we had two desks! A work desk and a makeup type desk. We also had a loveseat. The hotel is not the most impressive as far as The Strip is concerned. We had friends at the Bellagio across the street - that was much nicer and impressive. But we paid half of what they paid. We went to the pool at the Bellagio with our friends - it was gorgeous, clean, I wanted to skip classes and stay there all day. Then we tried the Bally's pool.

It was crowded, chairs all messed up everywhere and it smelled like a fraternity house after a late night party. Sour beer and vomit. Yuck! Won't be going back to the pool.

Ballys is connected to other hotels via the Monorail. This train is a joy to ride as it's fast, scenic, and comfortable, though expensive.

Check their website for \"Hot Deals\" before booking from any other source. The casino was pretty good and seemed above average in payouts. The clientele was a little older than at some other places. All ages are represented, but they don't offer anything that most of the late 20's-early 30's crowd might be attracted to. Depending on what kind of experience you want, that might not be a negative thing. I would estimate there is, overall, about a 2-to-1 grandma in a motorized scooter-to-hottie ratio. In other words: If you're coming to Vegas to find or make something happen that will stay in Vegas, Bally's is probably not for you. We stayed in a luxury room in the north tower. It was huge and farily comfortable. I wasn't thrilled with the couch and upholstered seat. They looked a little on the dingy side. However, the king sized bed was very nice. It looked and smelled clean. The bathroom was good. The hot water got to lava-like temperature in no time. I would update the shower head. No matter how I adjusted the flow, it was either too little or wide. I would also update the bath to the curved shower curtain for a more luxury style feel. Downstairs in the Tequila Bar, it was a little overpriced ($9 for a margarita). The mixed drinks, while flavorful, lacked their expected potency. Bally's has a steakhouse and some sort of Asian restaraunt but we did not eat there. They do have a buffet with a great view of the Strip. Based on the atmosphere, one might expect the food to be fancy and really good. It instead was about average on taste and quality while above average on price (about $24/person for dinner). They also feature a coffee bar. The price of a large cup of regular joe was $4. The coffee bar also sells pastries, which average $3-4. As far as entertainment, we did not see the Jubilee show. Instead, I bought tickets for \"The Price is Right Live.\" Having watched the show my entire life, I was hoping it would be a special experience. Especially for $40/person. They advertise that \"Everyone Can Play and Win\" and that they use \"Interactive terminals\" at each seat. However, the operative word is \"Can.\" Players are chosen at random based on correct responses using keypads to pricing questions on various products from various years. Four people chosen at random based on the correct response move forward to check out the next item up for bid, and then the winner of that goes up on stage to play one of the trademark pricing games. There were 3 different sets of 4 contestants and then two chosen at random based on more polling to vie for the showcase. I was disappointed that I got nothing out of the game other than 90 minutes of watching several other people guess the wrong price on stuff. They also have a lounge which is immediately adjacent to the casino. It's not in a seperate room and not very intimate. Live music plays nightly until 3-4AM and the bands were fairly good, which is a plus because the lounge is basically open to the casino, the music flows out everywhere. The sign in front says that there is a 2-drink minimum for entering the lounge. First, if it were in a seperate area away from the casino and lobby I would find that acceptable. Since the lounge is connected and open except for some railings and half-walls, I can stand outside and look in to watch and listen to the band for free. Which is probably the better choice because the seating in the lounge is very limited. People had to move tables out of the way to make dancing room so the amount of room to \"get jiggy with it\" was limited by the few people \"getting their groove on.\" The age group in the lounge was decidedly 40's-50's. If it was a larger style venue, I could see it possibly attracting a younger set, or at least more people and increasing the probability for a younger set. I did not see any wheelchair ramps for grandma into the lounge, so that was a factor as well. Outside, there is a moving walkway that connects the main lobby to the strip. Bally's is also connected to Paris Las Vegas, which has a better paying casino especially during late nights, was less crowded and less smoky. Bally's bills itself as \"The Classic Vegas Experience.\" I would describe that as accurate.

We usually stay downtown, but my brother had never been to Las Vegas before, so I thought \u201cThe Strip\u201d would be better for him to experience Sin City. I did a lot of research and concluded that the best place to stay would be Bally\u2019s. They have a great location, right in the center of \u201cThe Strip,\u201d as well as a reasonable price. I booked the room well in advance (April) for our trip at Christmas (December 24th-28th, 2006). Check-in at the airport was quick, as we arrived by plane at around 1:30pm and there was only one person in line ahead of us. When I made the reservations, I requested non-smoking, North Tower rooms. We both received North Tower rooms, but my mother and I had to settle for a smoking room, as no non-smoking rooms with two queen beds were available. I was told that requests made at the time of booking are not guaranteed by Bally\u2019s (or most casinos in Las Vegas). While our room was still not ready by the time we arrived at Bally\u2019s (around 2:30pm), we dropped off our stuff in my brother\u2019s room on the fifteenth floor. Unlike some of the other casino/hotel\u2019s my mother and I have stayed at (Golden Nugget and Eldorado-Reno), Bally\u2019s does not have a security guard posted at the elevators to check to see if you are actually staying at the hotel. I didn\u2019t like that at all. When our room was finally ready (around 5:30pm), we headed up to the twenty-second floor. When we got off the elevator, we passed a nice little sitting area before heading to Room 2235. We could smell the smoke as we entered, but we didn\u2019t complain. The casino was full of smoke, so we would be smelling like an ashtray after an evening of gambling anyway. The room was very large, with two queen beds, a clock radio, a table, a writing desk, three chairs, a comfy chair, two bed ottomans, a television (with limited amount of channels) in a cabinet with remote, and two telephones. There was also an iron/ironing board, a safe, and an extra pillow in the walk-in closet. The carpet had a few stains on it, which may have been cigarette burns (I\u2019m not used to seeing that). The view from our room looked west towards Bally\u2019s South Tower and the Fountains of Bellagio Show. We could also see part of the Eiffel Tower, if you looked off to the side. The bathroom was large as well, with a wall long mirror over the sink. There were shelves under the sink with extra towels, face cloths, facial tissue, and toilet paper. They also provided a bar of soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and a shower cap. The shower was easy to operate, but did not have a handle to hold on to, which made it difficult for my mother. Unfortunately, the \u201csitting area\u201d near the elevator was right beside our room, and we could hear all the noisy people who seem to hang out there. The first night they were yelling, screaming, swearing, and banging on doors all night long. They were still at it, even after we got up in the morning to do some early gambling (5:00am). The next three nights were not as bad as the first, as I think the alcohol and lack of sleep finally caught up with them. Bally\u2019s is adjoined to the Paris Hotel/Casino through a walkway which gets very crowded, especially with the lineups for Le Village Buffet and some of the other restaurants and eateries. While the casino area at the Paris is very large, the casino at Bally\u2019s is medium sided with a large gaming area separating the north slot room with the south slot room. None of us came away winners from the casino at Bally\u2019s, but my mother managed to win a few times to cut her losses a bit. Both my brother and mother were able to get a free Bally\u2019s sweatshirt for earning ten Reward Points on their new slot cards. I was not able to get one as I joined in 1996, oh well\u2026. Parking is a bit of a problem at Bally\u2019s. They share a parkade with Paris and it seems to be quite full all of the time. After being frustrated in not finding a parking spot right away, I learned a valuable lesson\u2026PARK ON THE FIFTH FLOOR! It will save you from a headache, trust me! Check-out was very easy, and I was asked if I enjoyed my stay. I had mentioned about the noise and she said if I had phoned security? I told her what was the point, Bally\u2019s did not have security for the elevators, so what could they have done. I did not get a response, so I left it at that. After taxes, the room cost $97.01 U.S. Funds per night for the four nights. All three of us thought the rooms we had were very nice. They were large, relatively clean, and quite comfortable. Despite the noise, if we were to stay on \u201cThe Strip\u201d again, we would give Bally\u2019s another try.

I asked if I can have connecting rooms, they said absolutley. I booked the luxury room online. 2 rooms for myself and my family. I comfirmed it twice before I left. The Front Desk person was the rudest front desk person I have ever encountered in my life and I've traveled all over the world, been to Vegas numerous times since 1996. As she was checking us in I told her I wanted to make sure we had connecting rooms. She got very hostile with me and replied that they have no connecting rooms and the other room we booked would be 10 floors above the other room. She also said they had no double beds which we requested. I needed double beds since 2 of my family members were sharing a room..She told me very angrily there are no double beds available at all. Then I asked her what the views would be.. She replied in a very hostile and angry way that we would have no view at all. I told her I called to confirm and was told I was guarnteed a room with a view. She got very angry and snapped at me, saying the hotel gurantees nothing and we have no view. ... I then got very angry at this point. I told her in a nasty tone that is lie because on Ballys online booking, the luxury rooms come with a \"spectacular view\" .. I then said I called the hotel to ask the difference bewteen the Luxury and Deluxe room and was told all of the Luxury rooms come with a \"spectacular\" view and thats why I booked it and payed more money otherwise I would have payed less for the Deluxe Room without a view. So after that she says nothing and for about 10 minutes, types into her computer. We are just waiting there. She finally says, ok I found 2 rooms for you, next to each other with a great view in the renovated North tower..She said One with a 2 double beds and one with a King that you requested..

I ate only at Sidewalk Cafe. Thought it was nice, casual place to grab something for a quick bite. I did most of my eating at other hotels at Emerils, Top of The world, Mix The Negative for me is the rude and hostile Front Desk. The hotel really needs to improve their customer service. The hotels for the elevators are not so safe, anyone can get on them. You don't need a room key to access them. I found this to be unsafe for anyone traveling alone. The wait for a taxi at the hotel, takes forever. Not too many cabs pull up at Ballys. If you stay at Ballys don't let the Front Desk people put you into a room that you did not book or a bad room. Make sure you get what you payed for..Be sure to be aggressive and firm until they give you the room you booked. I would not be staying again, I don't care to fight with front desk people.

Bally's had a really reasonable rate, so we booked two nights, leaving the third night of our 4 day/3 night vacation free. Check in at McCarran airport was easy and quick, and we asked for and received a North Tower room. We opted to try the shuttle to the hotel ($14 for the two of us). After navigating to the correct exit, we waited in line for about 20 minutes, and boarding the 15 passengers took another 10 minutes. We took the \"tunnel route\" and dropped off passengers at Caeser's, Bellagio and Paris before finally arriving at the hotel. Next time, we'll stick to our usual cab transportation - maybe a dollar or two more, but so much quicker. Even during NAB we never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a cab. The room at Bally's had a view towards the Westin and the Wynn. It was a standard king room, one of the largest I've seen, a little worn around the edges but extremely clean. They changed out the bedding during our stay (new mattress pads) and the beds were even more comfy. The marble bath was nothing special, but nicely appointed with a mirrored wall and great-smelling toletries. We ordered room service twice, once for a late night snack and once for breakfast. Both times, it was delived within 25 minutes on a rolling cart with white linen and generous condiment selections. Breakfast was garnished with both the sweetest strawberries we've ever had and orchids. Service throughout our stay (and we ended up staying our third night here, rather than trying someplace else) was friendly and almost unfailingly impeccable. The only exception was a cranky server at the coffee stand in the lobby. We tried the buffet, which had excellent prime rib and desserts, and the deli in the shopping concourse, which featured Boar's Head meats and so was as good as expected.

There was a huge group two rooms down from us that would party until 6 AM every day of our stay. I know this is Vegas & all, but come on now!

The hotel/casino is connected to Paris Las Vegas, adjacent to the Flamingo and across the Street from the Bellagio, not to mention it is situated in the heart of the strip, equi-distant to the MGM on one end and the Venetian on the other. The casino was a decent size with plenty of slots and tables, and had an overall good vibe about the joint. The lobby was large and broad with check-in/out lines that were well staffed and moved reasonably quickly. Our room was average in size and quality as far as major hotel brands go and was fairly clean both stays. The hotel had a few places to eat including a steak house, a few chain restaurants, like Sbarros et al. There was a coffee shop-diner type eatery right off the main casino floor and lobby, which is where we ate our only meals on the premises (specifically, we ate only a breakfast or two and some late night drunk food, aside from room service). The hotel had several shops on the main and sub levels where we found an enormous sports book room. The hotel staff was pretty courteous and had promptly responded to our calls for room service. Lastly, the room was afforadble over Labor Day weekend, $89 USD a night (I think) and even more reasonable from $189 to $289 USD over New Year's Eve weekend, considering the prices of rooms in other hotels were going for $500 a night.

Thankfully not much of a line at the hotel. I forgot the golden rules I read on here to ask for the north tower and a room near the elevator, but we must have been lucky as we got both. The room was clean, modern and a lot bigger than the one we paid a lot more money for at Luxor last year.

Last year we spent a night at Bally's and loved it. From that one night we received all kinds of free offers, and had alot of our food comped. When we booked this year, they offered us our room for free (upgraded in North Tower) so we stayed all four nights. Overall, I really like Bally's, but like I said, I remembered it better. The one thing that really bothered me was that most of the restaurants were closed entirely or at 3pm when we were there this year. The day before Thanksgiving, I couldn't see the excuse for this. The Sidewalk Cafe, which used to be (and is still advertised as) a 24 hour restaurant closes in the afternoon. And while the food that I did have there was excellent, the menu is decidedly very boring. Not a lot for choices. Three of the nights we were there, our choices to eat in the hotel were the Steakhouse (very expensive) or the buffet (which is pretty good, but who wants to eat at a buffet for every meal), or the Mexican pub/bar. Apparently this is now normal if you aren't there on a weekend. Also, we gambled substantially more this trip than our one night last trip but received only a fraction of the comps in the hotel. Last year most of our food for the day was free, this year I got a few dollars off a T-shirt. I'm attributing this to the change to Total Rewards, and the takeover from Harrah's. I can't really complain though, since our room was free. As a side note, I sent my mother and Grandmother to see Wayne Newton's Christmas show, and they loved it. Still raving about it now. We also stopped in to see The Price is Right live. Great entertainment value, although some of the prices seemed quite wonky. Lastly, if you want to go to an awesome (but affordable) buffet, the one at Harrah's is great. It's very easy to get to and the food is really good. I don't think I got to sample everything but I was stuffed and it was well worth it. Ok, really lastly. This was the first time we rented a car for entire trip - I've heard people comment about how intimidating the traffic can be in Vegas. However, if you avoid the strip at rush hour and keep an eye out for the kamikaze taxi drivers it's really not that bad. We saw more in these four days than the other eight combined. The self park garages are usually quite handy and if you want an easy listing of the locations for most of them, check out the transportation section of Vegas.com, their list is quite useful.

And that's what we got. We had reserved a king, non-smoking room. When we arrived we were told that was not available and they upgraded us to a non-smoking suite for one night. We were told we'd have to move our room the next day or pay an extra $100/night to stay in the suite. We decided we'd move. The suite was beautiful with a huge sunken jacuzzi in the room and marble tile throughout the bath. Our friends were given the same upgrade for the first night. (Although, beware because another front desk clerk told one couple they'd have to stay in a smoking room. When they found out that we'd been upgraded to the suite without even having to ask, they pushed back and insisted they get the same and they did.) The next day we moved to a king, non-smoking room which was lovely as well. The bed was comfortable, the room clean, and the bathroom very nice.

There's an omelet station, pastries, fruit, breakfast meats, salad, pancakes, french toast. Bally's is connected to Paris which is a beautiful theme hotel. We went there every day for a meal or snack. There are a few quaint cafe-type restaurants there and, our favorite, the Creperie. It's a stand that serves made-to-order crepes filled with everthing from berries and cream to bananas and peanut butter to ham and cheese. They were delicious! That's actually the last place we went before heading off to the airport. Other things I enjoyed: We saw the Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian which was phenomenal.

Overall, I am not a huge fan of the city of Las Vegas, but we have had several weddings in the last few years to attend. I will never hesitate to stay at Ballys again.

We found ourselves walking through the short corridor to Ballys (they are connected indoors which makes it very convenient) most of the time to gamble there or take a shortcut to head North up Las Vegas Boulevard. One morning we tried the breakfast buffet and he loved it. Omelets made to order and just a huge amount of food choices. It was never super crowded (though we did go early). We decided on the next trip that the location couldn't be beaten and we would stay at Bally's. Ballys and several other LV casinos (Caesars, Mirage, Paris) share the Total Rewards card and I used it minimally on our trip when we stayed at the Paris. Well, even so, I kept getting free offers to stay in Vegas through the program so we decided to book a Trip and came out in early October to stay 2 nights free at Bally's. Though I enjoyed their casino and buffet, I wasn't too sure about the rooms since we hadn't stayed before. When we got off the plane, we used the airport checkin for Bally's and were asked if we would like to upgrade to a suite. After viewing the pictures they had we decided why not pay $100 to upgrade since we were already getting the rooms for nothing. WOW! I'm so glad we did. Our suite was gigantic at 750 square feet. There was a large living room area, large bedroom area attached his and hers sinks, a separate toilet, shower and in the very middle of the room by the bathroom was a jacuzzi tub. It was clean and roomy and we just loved it. Bally's location, I believe, is the best on the strip. It has a walkway that goes across the street if you want to visit Bellagio or Caesars and one going north if you want to head up to Barbary Coast, Flamingo, Harrah's, the Venetian and The Wynn. Also, as a sidenote, my husband loved that there was a small convenience store east of Barbary Coat that we could get reasonably priced items for our room (and not have to go to Bally's gift shop) and just cross the street back into Bally's. Also, It's right around the corner from Ellis Island if you want to try their famous food special there. We were going to move to MGM for our last night to see KA so we just video checked out and hopped on the Monorail from Bally's for a 1 minute tram ride to the MGM. To the east of the casino are stairs that lead you down to the lower level and monorail station. And guess what? There was a little shopping/food area down there by the spa I didn't even know was there (Sparros and other lower price food places) Who Knew? Overall, we thought for the price and location, Bally's was a good choice to fit our needs for this trip.", "Date": "November 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cBally's is always a great choice!\u201d", "Author": "briehl01", "ReviewID": "UR6033675", "Content": "I recently stayed at Bally's Las Vegas for the second time.

However, if you want a basic hotel with a friendly staff and a great location, Bally's works fine. This was my second stay in Vegas and quite an improvement from the frustration I had while staying at the Excalibur. The lack of themes didn't bother me at all; actually, I found it refreshing. I stayed at Bally's as part of a small conference and paid $149/night. I was given a room in the South Tower, which worked out better because the first two days of meetings were held in the South Tower. I arrived around noon to check in; I didn't see the counter at the airport although admittedly, I didn't actively search for it. Bally's didn't have any King rooms ready, but said they could do everything but assign me a room. All I would have to do after 3 p.m. was go to the VIP check in and ask for my room key. I checked my bags with the bell captain; again, they were very friendly and courteous. After reading the reviews here, I was concerned about my room location. However, the room I received in the South Tower was clean and, while it did show its age, didn't smell like stale smoke. The problem I had was that the room faced Paris and I could hear the trucks on the loading docks in the early morning. There is no work desk, just a round table and four chairs; the internet service is expensive ($12.95/day) and took a few times to log in. As a business traveler, I found this a little frustrating since when I wasn't in sessions, I had to work. The bathroom was clean and had glass tumblers instead of plastic cups. The bed was okay; again, nothing extraordinary. The hotel's location is great. If you want glitz and glamour, Paris is connected to Bally's, with a great walkway filled with theme restaurants and shops. The shops in the Bally's area are okay as well. The Bellagio is across the street. The business center is located between Bally's and Paris and while the staff is nice, the center itself is lackluster. What was most annoying was that I couldn't plug my laptop in to print and none of the computers had a USB port for my flashdrive. The prices for computer usage are very high and since there is no alternative, you have to use their computers. The first two days of conferences were held in the Las Vegas Ballrooms in the South Tower. They were accessible from casino level via the escalator and, since I was staying in the South Tower, right off the elevator. The meeting rooms were kind of dated as well and the staff seemed a little slow to respond to technical needs. We later found out that Bally's shares ALL meeting services with Paris and the meeting services are based out of Paris. This becomes an issue if you're planning an event at the hotel and need a speedy response. The food and beverages for the meetings was typical hotel food; nothing outstanding for a lunch or breakfast buffet. The third day, our conferences were in the North Tower skyview rooms on the 26th floor. Be warned: if there are a lot of people going to conferences on that floor, the elevators will be packed and slow. I had dinner at the Bally's Tequila bar the first night and the food was decent. The wait staff was friendly and prompt. I didn't have dinner at the other restaurants in the hotel, opting to go to New York New York for one night and the Aladdin for the second.

We originally booked on the internet and could not confirm a non-smoking room so I called Bally's directly. They advised they could not guarantee non-smoking but to request it once we arrive at the airport as they have a reservation desk near the baggage claim area. When we arrived we asked about our room and were advised we were booked in the South Tower and the rooms were about 20 years old. The gentleman offered to put us in the North Tower for a small additional charge per night ($35 per night) which we agreed to and was non-smoking. Our upgrade gave us complimentary access to the \"22nd Club\" which provided a lounge where we could get a quick coffee, snack in the morning or a drink, hot snack in the afternoon. The rooms were clean and we had a south-side view overlooking Paris and we could see part of Bellagio's fountains. The great advantage of Bally's is it's central location on the strip and outside of Bally's they have walkways over the street to keep people moving (one goes to Bellagio's and the other to the Flamingo). We were able to visit all the key hotels and casino's. Some of the hotels such as Bally's also have people movers so you get a bit of a break from walking. We checked out Bally's pool but it was cool the days we went out and originally they told us we could use the Paris pool but when we got there, they told us no. Perhaps because Bally's pool was open. The Bally's pool is big and deep. The shops downstairs were not overly impressive. Try the Forum Shops or visit Paris next door. Everytime we wanted to eat at the Buffet in Bally's it was lined up out the door. Paris has lots of restaurants but they were generally busy too. A few restaurants that we tried included Jimmy Buffet's (north of Bally's) and Smith Wollensky Steak House (south of Bally's). Both have balconies or outside areas to watch the action on the strip and we enjoyed both. Paris is connected with a walkway from the Bally's Casino and is very nice to visit. We also went to the Western Grand Canyon, Hoover's Dam and drove through the desert to Oatman, Arizona. The drive on Route 66 from Oatman was really interesting going through the canyons and the Mohave Desert. Car rentals are very affordable in Las Vegas.

Tip: Always check in at the airport - the front desk usually has a line. Bally's has been one of our favs in Vegas for many years. The casino is starting to really show some age, however. They've removed some of the slots (why?) and I only saw one big winner all weekend, so I assume they are letting this Harrah's property die slowly while they boost the other properties. Too bad. There isn't a better location center strip. This one is in the center of everything. Our room in the north tower (a King Suite) was awesome. There was a huge King Bed, a jacuzzi in the middle of the marble bath, a bidet, two vanities, a separate shower and a separate potty room. There was also a connecting bedroom with a Pullman bed, a conference table and another full bath. we really enjoyed our space. The only improvement needed was a little more power to the air conditioning. Tip: bring a large clip for the drapes - the lights on the outside of the building create a virtual daytime at all hours and you can never get them totally closed. The casino at Bally's used to pay us well, especailly the dollar slots. This time, we hit nothing and ended up cruising the strip to play our dwindling bankroll. We did use our comps at the Sidewalk Cafe (great breakfast) and at Al Dente, the italian restaurant. The waiter apologized for the noise inside the usually sedate Al Dente - they had two wedding parties at one time. Nevertheless, the food was outstanding. You can do a room charge or use your comps at any of the restaurants in Ballys, Flamingo, Harrah's, Rio or Caesars. One of the best secrets in Bally's is the Indigo Lounge. The band that plays Thursday - Sunday is awesome, similar to the Platters and 60s Motown groups. It makes for a great atmosphere in the casino. It is hard to find a seat at the table games in the evenings. Most were $10 tables. Take your walking shoes. Even though this hotel has a great location, it is a ten minute walk to get to the strip in front. Use the moving sidewalk and do everyone a favor by actually \"walking\" on the sidewalk. There are so many folks who block the way for everyone else by standing on the moving belt - the rule is \"walk left, stand right\". Mon Ami Gabi in Paris is the best location to see the Bellagio water show across the street. Ask for the patio and dress for Vegas weather. The wine selection and steaks are awesome here, but a little pricey. The Eiffel Tower restaurant is not worth the extra $$. Want to shop? The Desert Passage mall is next door to Paris at the Aladdin and has dozens of stores, not just \"casino\" attire. I'm hoping Bally's sticks around a little longer.

This continued until around 2am when they finally started checking people in manually, checking each room one by one according to the housekeeping lists from earlier in the day. Finally they offered up some rooms at Harrah's a few hotels away, or at the Rio (off the strip). We opted for the Rio, by the time we checked in there it was already 3am and being from the east it was already 6am for us. We heard later on that the computers came up around 11am the next day. The Rio was fantastic, if you haven't been off the strip, take the time to check out the few casino/hotels on Tropicana. See my Rio review: VIP Treatment. We called Bally's before checking out of the Rio because there was a four hour difference between check out and check in at both hotels. Bally's told us that we'd have to just wait until 3pm to check in. They didn't even want to hear about how we were \"walked\" over to Rio by them two nights before. We were comped the two nights at Rio and made our way back to Bally's. Before we even got to say anything to the gentleman at check-in he immediately told us that check-in was at 3pm and they were sold out for the night. I have to say that I was a bit cheezed by his statement. We walked up to him and told him that we were supposed to be here on Monday, NOT Wednesday, and that we were told we could get an early check in. Funny enough he suddenly remember a list, found our names and had a room in the north tower immediately for us to go to. The first thing we saw in the room was a note from management saying that the pool was closed for maintenance until Sept 9th and that hotel guests could use the pool at the Paris next door. If we didn't have a room facing the pool, we would have never known that it was reopened a couple days earlier. Besides all of this the rest of our stay at Bally's was great. The room was excellent, clean and had a great view. We could see the south end of the strip, along with the surrounding hills and the city lights. The room was tidied up every day. The location of Bally's was great too. We've stayed at the MGM before, but found it a bit of a trek to get back from the other end (especially after alot of walking). The casino is a good size, the inhouse band was very entertaining. The Big Kitchen Buffet was good, probably not as exciting if you've gone to Paris or any of the larger buffets. And the Bally's Steakhouse is a bit pricey but well worth the money. If it wasn't for the initial check-in fiasco, I probably wouldn't have a bad thing to say about Bally's.

The check-in took about 20 minutes, but after that, all was well. The room is larger than most standard Vegas rooms (useful if sharing with four people) and cheaper as they regard children as below 16 years. Most hotels treat 12 year olds as adults. The room was well appointed, very clean and recently refurbished. Although in the North Tower, we still had a view of the strip, and the Belagio fountains. The hotel is linked to Paris, where we ate breakfast and I used the more impressive casino. Whilst I would not encourage people to take children to Vegas due to the seedy atmosphere creted by the constant bombardment for prostitutes and strip clubs, if you are planning a family trip you could do a lot worse than Bally's. The buffet is quite good, and good value if you are hungry. However, the buffet at Treasure Island was better, and only marginally more expensive. It has a central strip location (probably the best position on the strip, and very important in the heat), and it is reasonably good value. In contrast, Circus Circus, which is touted as the family hotel, looks awful, and the actual circus acts are not that great.

I used my Total Rewards and was able to get three nights for only $180 total. I was thrilled considering it was a weekend. We were in town for the Def Leppard concert at Mandalay Bay and needed a cheap place to stay. We have stayed at Bally's three times in the past two years and have never been disapointed. One time we got North Tower, and twice the South Tower. Personally, I like the South Tower better - only if you get a good view. They generally have better views if you get a high floor. This time we have agreat room on the 12th floor with a not so good view. We weren't in the room much anyway to care. The first night we got in around 8:00. Airport check in was closed for Ballys and Paris due to computer problems so off we went to the hotel itself after getting our rental car. We grabbed a quick bite at the deli outside the south tower elevators. Awesome sandwhiches. We charged everything to our room the entire trip so we could rack up some points and have comps taken off our bill at the end of the trip. I changed and went right downstairs to gamble while my hubby relaxed a bit. We met up around 11:30 and decided to roam the strip. Loved Margaritaville music and drinks. Loved Osheas drinks even better as they were so cheap. Did some people watching and went to bed around 4:00. We slept in the next day (I was hungover) and decided a late lunch/early dinner would be nice. Drove to Venetian in order to eat at the Grand Lux Cafe which was excellent. Ran into a problem all weekend with valet parking as everything was full except for hotel guests, but we actually had no problem parking in the hotel garages and lucked out with close spots everywhere. Home to Ballys for naps and then off to the concert. It was great! Explored Mandalay Bay a bit after and then I ended up gambling at Barbury Coast for 6 hours until 7 am (only losing $5). Stopped at Nosh in Ballys to grap a bagel snadwhich for me and hubby which he appreciated. Honestly, it was the best breakfast sandwhich I have ever had. Slept in again and decided to eat at Sabarro in Ballys downstains (yummy). Then off to do touristy (sp?) things throughout the strip. This included the MGM lions which were the cutest babies I have ever seen. We loved it! Also checked out the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay and walking around Luxor and Excalibur. The Shark Reef was ok - mostly uneventful. I like the aquarium here in Baltimore so much better. Afterwards we drove home to Ballys and walked to Outback Steakhouse for a late dinner. Somehow whenever we come to Vegas we always end up eating at Outback for some reason. More gambling for me and then off to bed around 4:00. Woke the next day to check out and leave our bags with bell hop. Our favorite thing to do on our last day here is go to the highest deck at Margaritaville and spend the day looking out at the strip while enjoying some beers and awesome nachos.

We actually got a really great deal at what we thought was going to be an exceptional hotel --the name \"Bally's\" to me, was synonomous with a five star hotel -- I'm assuming that was because of it's reputation back in it's hey day which was some decades ago. While I don't want to give this hotel a bad rap, I do want readers to know there are better, newer, more modern hotels that may be just a little higher in price, but in my opinion well worth the extra dollars. My dissatisfaction with Bally's is as follows: It's age is obvious as you drive up to the hotel. While it is not in particularly bad shape, next to it's counterparts the architecture is a bit outdated and just looks worn. The interior also has this same aged appearance. It's obvious at one point in time it was a magnificent hotel but it seems there were no remodels to keep up with the more modern times. The \"check in line\" was a about a 30-35 minute wait. This is something I am not used since I am usually a NYNY or Monte Carlo guest where I can usually walk up to a receptionist or at worst have nothing more than a 10 min wait. The \"check out\" was much worse and something that constitutes a legitmate complaint. There were people everywhere and that wait exceeded 45min at the very least. The rooms again were older, not as modern and the decor seemed out of style. The bathroom also the same. While I can't complain about the cleanliness, just the fact that it's older things just don't appear to be as fresh and clean as the newer hotels. Service definitely could have been better and in Las Vegas I expect it to be so with all the money that is being played by it's guests. The very least a hotel could do is treat it's guests like we are \"winners\" even if we are not! Staff was not rude, but certainly not on the better end of hospitality. There is plenty of room for improvement here. I want to see smiling faces, friendly welcoming personalities and staff who goes the mile, however small the request. I know this is not an impossible expectation because I have had this wonderful experience elsewhere. I ate a small pizza and hot dog shop right off the casino floor. Not enough tables and they were all dirty. Once I found one that was available I had to get some napkins and wipe down myself. The casino was a little dark and dreary and seemed to be a little lifeless. For those who are like me -- I came to Vegas for the excitement and adrenaline. I like to hear machines paying out, people yelling at a crap table and somebody's cheer when they've got a blackjack. I didn't get this vibe here so I don't have anymore of an opinion regarding the rest of the gambling experience at Bally's -- I took my money somewhere a little more livelier. For those who are interested in the type of demographic -- mostly an older more mature crowd. Very few 20 somethings, so at least you don't need to be concerned about any obnoxious antics. I have read other reviews about a more updated tower -- obviously this was not the one I stayed in. Or perhaps the author of those other reviews has not had a lot of experiences elsewhere to compare. My general advice would be to continue to look for a competive rate in a newer casino. It seems to me you will get more for your money all around. But if you can't find a better rate at least you will know what to expect.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "allentown", "Title": "\u201cwonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "pattie627", "ReviewID": "UR5711150", "Content": "ballys was just as i expected. my sisters and i arrived at ballys at 11am there was no check in line and our room was ready. we were given a room in the north tower and it was larger then i expected. the room service was great by the time we got back from the pool our room was done and we only stayed at the pool 3 hours or so. on the first floor there is a little resturant the food was cheap and the portions were very large its next to the stairs near the lounge. the location is in the center of the strip with a monorail stop a trolley stop and the shuttle to the rio. the lounge music is fantastic and they dont push you to keep buying drinks. i would recommend this hotel to anyone especially for a first time trip. i cannot wait to go back and ballys will be the place to go", "Date": "August 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cBirthday celebration at Ballys\u201d", "Author": "Jill&Ralph", "ReviewID": "UR5711075", "Content": "Just got back yesterday from 5 night stay at Ballys.

We paid $175 per night with the two nights averaged together. I'm sure that when the old MGM Grand was remodeled and expanded after the tragic 1980 fire, it was pretty impressive. Unfortunately, the overall look and appearance does not seem to have changed much, other than maybe new carpet. Here is my take on the various aspects of our stay: Reception - excellent, got in very early Friday a.m. and was checked in, checked our luggage, and told to pick up key at noon. Staff was friendly, and very helpful. This being our first trip to a Vegas Casino Hotel on the Strip, initial impression of Lobby and casino was that it was \"Nice\", but we had nothing to compare it to. After walking around and seeing Ceasar's, Paris, Ballagio, Wynn, NY NY, Venetian, MGM Grand, those readers who have stayed at those places will know Bally's is a has been, not unlike Sratosphere, Harrah's, Riviera, Imperial Palace, and others built or last renovated around the same time. Checked into room in South Tower, great view of the Strip, large room, very cold A/C which was great. Furniture and decor are a - la - 80's, except TV which is a 25\" stereo and worked well. Room was very clean, had two queens as requested, and firm but \"sleepable\" mattresses. Bath too was dated, with cracks in sink and toilet seat. Cold water came out of the shower at a drizzle, therefore we had to either scald ourselves in the shower, with all pressure coming from the hot water side, or fill the tub an hour ahead of time and let it cool down to bathing temp. Called for repair, but am reasonably certain no one ever came to check it. We had unpacked our stuff, and didn't want to mess with changing rooms, so we put up with it. Pool - is a very long walk from the So. Tower, winding you through the casino in your bathing suit, down an escalator, past a very third rate shopping area all the way to the end where you emerge into a grossly undersized pool area that was wall to wall loungers, with limited shady areas to escape the 110 degree heat. Small frozen drinks (12 oz.) from the pool bar are $9, plus tip. A 16 oz. beer is $6. At those prices, you would think they would have waitresses running around all over trying to get you to drink up; however two people were waiting on the 500 or so sunbathers. Bally's does its part for the homeless though, given that two derelict wino looking guys were walking around picking up trash, bottles, empty glasses, etc. Uniforms are apparently not provided to, nor worn by these guys. Pool is small, black algae in the grout joints is provided free of charge, paint chipping off of the edge coping adds to the overall \"Route 66\" budget motel motif. The only food we ate at Bally's was the Big Kitchen Buffet for Breakfast Saturday A.M. It was $14 with tax, and was in fact very good, with typical fair, and an omelet station. The much touted \"Best View of the Strip\" from the buffet was the back side of the Barbary Coast Hotel next door. Two conveniences of Bally's are the monorail stop, and trolly stop at the property. The Monorail is expensive, and has limited stops at the back of a few hotels on the east side of the strip, so unless you are there for a convention at the convention center, which it goes right to, it is of little value for getting around. The trolley, which is $6.50 for a day pass, is much more convenient, stopping closer to the strip at many, many more hotels, particularly on the west side of the strip. Be prepared to spend about one hour for the ride from one end of the strip to the other. The location is the only saving grace for Bally's. Ceasar's and the Bellagio are across the street and it is connected to Paris, a superior sister property. It is actually more convenient to shop at Paris than at Bally's, and the shopping experience is superior, with many more shops and eateries, in the \"streets of Paris\" under the sky atmosphere. In summary, I tend to be about value. I don't expect Bellagio decor and shops for $100 bucks a night, but I expected alot more from Bally's at $175, and it just isn't worth it. It can best be summed up by saying it is probably worth every penny, if you can stay there for well under $100 a night. Having accompanied my 20 year old to Vegas, I gambled very little and went to no clubs, so we saw three shows, and sightseed alot, so here are some other observations, very briefly. Mystere at TI by Cirque - Got $95 second row seats, worth every penny, absolutely breathtaking, amazing, cute, funny, highly recomend it. The Sirens of TI show in front of Treasure Island - It is also worth every penny, insofar as it's free. Don't waste your time putting up with the hot, smelly, elbow to elbow crowds, they would have to pay me to wait for that 20 minute absurdity again. The Mac King Comedy Magic Show at Harrah's - It's $20, and very much worth it. Very clean, no profanity, several gut busting laughs to offset some gags that are on the corny side, two or three nifty, mouth agape with \"how'd he do that?\" illusions, but no Lance Burton, and not $100 bucks either, so I would recommend it as well. Rita Rudner at NY NY - If you don't know her, be prepared for the type of humor in the style of Bob Newhart, or even earlier, Jack Benny. Very low key and very funny, with very little sexual innuendo and no profanity, and alot of self depracating humor. She is kind of a permanent headliner, so she gets $62.50 for her show, but again I felt it was worth it. Finally, having spent most of three days walking into and around hotels, short impressions of each I visited other than Bally's: Ceasars - Probably the grandest and most over the top themed hotel, very impressive, even if you know that all that architecture, columns, statuary, fountains, and such is fiberglass. Most authentic looking fake plants I've ever seen. It looks good, but virtually everything in the place is fake. If it ever burned up, it would produce more black smoke than the oil well fires from Desert Storm. Bellagio - Very elegant, very well done, half the fiberglass of Ceasars. Wynn - Other than the astroturf all over, this is the real deal. (story behind the astroturf, which really does look almost like real grass, is that it is more environmentally friendy by having 0 water consumption). All other landscaping, both exterior and interior, which is extensive, is real. Interior landscaping is so absolutely perfect, it is the fakest looking real plants I have ever seen. By far the most elegant, authentically expensive decor on the strip. Only theme here is genuine opulence. MGM Grand - Not in the same class anymore as Bellagio or Wynn, but very nice nonetheless. Paris, Venetian, NY NY, TI - All pretty impressive themed hotels, I would spend $200 a night at Paris or NY NY, TI is the least impressive of the four, the Venetian has some construction going on which is a temporary setback for it. Harrah's - Wow, really needs to be refurbished. Imperial Palace - Good candidate to be leveled. Barabary Coast - Why is it still around? Because it doesn't sit on enough land to do anything else with. Features $2.00 drinks, even if you gamble! However, $5 min wager tables are aplenty. Actaully ate at the restuarant, do yourself a huge favor, and don't. Stratosphere - So far north, so hard to get anywhere else, the only reason it's not leveled is the 1100 foot tower, which was also very impressive in 1963 when it was built, and mildly interesting now. Great night view of the strip and all of Vegas, to be sure. Since it's $10 buck a head to ride up the elevator, which was a 30 minute wait each way on a slow day, send your kid or spouse up with a camera while you gamble. The three \"Thrill rides\" at the top, which are $10 bucks each also, are lame. Seriously, this place needs a super face lift, or start over altogether. Didn't get to any others close enough or long enough to opine. As I said, I did little gambling, but did some at Bally's, Harrah's, and NY NY. Drinks are still free if you are gambling. The process is the same as at other casinos I've been to in other destinations. A waitress will come by every two hours or so at the penny/nickel/quarter slots, and every 10 minutes at the $25 min. wager tables. Go figure. One last tip, if you are souvenir hunting or thirsty as you walk around, go to the shops in free standing centers along the strip. Here, $1 souvenirs actually cost $1 instead of $7 at the hotel shops. Also, the best bargain in town is $1.79 beers from convenience stores and many little shops scattered around, which I would happily carry around with me to beat the heat as we ventured in and out of various hotels, stores, etc.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cVery good experience.....mostly.\u201d", "Author": "iriegirl", "ReviewID": "UR5604177", "Content": "This was a birthday trip for my father (and his first time in Vegas), and since we were going to be sharing a room I wanted to get one larger than most in Vegas....so I chose Bally's.

I think if Bally's is going to charge an upgrade fee for that building then, they need to be upfront about it and tell people in upon making reservations that those rooms are an extra $20.00 per night. Other than that, we had a FANTASTIC time in Vegas. I'm not a big gambler, but I managed to take home a few hundred dollars from the Rio/Mandalay Bay/Harrahs slot machines.

Bell service was fast and very polite. We had two rooms in the North tower. The view was OK, but the rooms were very nice and much larger than your average standard rooms. We booked the North tower specifically based upon traveler reviews from this site, and I am glad we did. We gambled quite a bit, and I cannot say enough good things about the casino staff. The pit bosses and dealers were EXTREMELY friendly. We came to Vegas not knowing everything about games like Craps and Let it Ride poker, but the dealers showed us what plays to make, when to make them, etc. The craps tables were by far the best anywhere.

It's a no frill plain and simple Las Vegas hotel in the centre of the strip. Previously we had stayed at MGM which I thought was one of the best Hotels to stay in Las Vegas. It was in the south of the strip. This time we decided to stay more in the centre of the strip as we had seen most of the hotels next to MGM (Luxor, New York New York etc). It was the best deal we could find for a hotel in the centre strip. We thought of Flamingo, but stayed away from it because of bad reviews it got. We went to check out Flamingos and we like what we saw there. Next time we may stay consider staying at that hotel. It seemed very lively and enjoyable for the Kids. Location: Best part of Bally's is that it's not a bad walk from the hotel room to get to the strip. This was the best thing we liked about Bally's. In MGM it took us at least 15-20 just to get from our room to the strip. It seemed like a long walk. There is people mover in Bally's which makes it easier. I didn't see like that in any other hotel. It's right next to Paris and opposite to Bellagio. Also Caeser's is just across from it. You also get a ride from here to Rio if you want to go there. Food: Except for their breakfast I didn\u2019t like the food much in there. We stayed away from their buffet. There is Paris buffet next door which is really good, but you have to be in queue for at least 20-30 mins before you see the food. Pool: I like the Bally's Pool. It was not very crowded, but was a plain and simple rectangle shape. Not a playful water place for Kids. What I like is that on one side it's 8-13 ft deep, so it was fun to swim in there.

I cannot stress this enough. We chose Bally's because of the reasonable rates, tripadvisor reviews, and most importantly its location (heart of strip). At check-in we were told it would cost $20 extra for the North Tower. Foolishly we turned down the upgrade. Our room in the South Tower was woefully out-of-date. The furniture looked like it was picked up at a flea market and the room looked like a motor lodge (see attached photos, Exhibit A). The view, however, was fantastic. We had a good view of the strip and could see 1/2 of the Bellagio water show (Ex. B) and were looking directly at the Eiffel Tower (Ex. C). Unfortunately, the view did not make up for the shoddy room. Ordinarily we wouldn\u2019t have minded the room, but we chose to pay $40 per night more to stay at Bally\u2019s versus Aladdins thinking it would be a nicer room. We were wrong. Anyway, we went down and talked to the front desk and they were EXTREMELY understanding and offered to move us into a renovated, North Tower room that night. However, because they only had smoking rooms available we decided to wait until the next day to get a non-smoking North Tower room. The North Tower room was fantastic! Everything was immaculate and posh. It was large; it had a large tree-like plant in the corner (Ex. D); it had a beautiful desk with leather upholstered chairs (Ex. E); it had granite countertops in the bathroom (Ex. F) and vanity (Ex. G); the bed had lots of pillows and was soft and comfy (Ex. H); the TV was in an entertainment center (Ex.

I really have no complaints with the traditional room but it was nice have a bath and a half for one night!! The staff at Bally's couldn't have been more accommodating! Vearn, at the front desk went out of his way, not just with us, but with everyone he waited on!! We even spent some time down by the pool!! Everyone was terrific! I went down for coffee one morning at the Java cafe. Is that the name of it? Can't remember. Anyway, it's opposite the registration desk and the pastries and the coffee were very yummy! Most of our meals were either eaten out or we were fed by the convention folks. There was a free shuttle that went to the Rio every half hour so we never had to catch a cab! We did walk to a lot of places and I probably put 70 miles on my trainers!! Only one blister to speak of but it was well worth it!! The temperature topped out at 112 degrees farenheit during our stay but, quite honestly, I didn't mind it. I prefere the heat to the cold so I didn't complain! It's hot here just outside of St. Louis too but it's also humid. Much different from Vegas. Bally's is very centrally located so you can walk to so many cool hotels and casinos! It was terrific just being able to view all of these incredible places! (Bally's has it's own charm and was fun to tour too! Also, you're connected to Paris so you don't have to go out on the sidewalk to visit there!) My friend drove up from L.A. to meet us and go to the meeting also and was treated very well in spite of the fact that she was a late-comer to the convention. They managed to get her the convention rate when it was all said and done. From the start though, she was charged the regular room rate. So they really are winners, in my eyes!! Speaking of winning, I won around $100 in the beginning of our stay!! Not too bad for a non-seasoned gambler!! Can't say I held onto the dough for too long, but it was entertaining! If my husband and I ever visit Las Vegas or I'm involved in a girl's getaway or another convention, I will try to book with Bally's!! I am posting some photos of the suite and a few others so you can see what it all looks like!! Email me at bdalindy@accessus.net if you'd like more info regarding my stay there!!

It was very nice with a large jacuzzi tub open to the living area and shower located behind a wall, but not ideal for privacy. It would be great for a couple. They brought in a rollaway for my daughter. The next day we moved to a standard room with two queen beds which worked out much better for us. This is what we had originally reserved. The hotel does guarantee a room with your reservation, but not a particular room type. This was a large north tower room and very pleasant. The bathroom is altogether, so only one person can use it at a time. We loved the location in mid strip and easily walked south to the Aladdin Desert Passage and north as far as the Venetian. Even though it was hot and humid we were surprised at how much you could see and do while staying inside. We enjoyed the Desert Passage, Paris(connected to Bally's through the Casino) , Forum Shops, New York and Venetian shopping areas. We liked the fact that Bally's with no particular theme or attraction for tourists was relatively peaceful and less crowded. It was also nice that you could quickly get to your room without a long walk. We never has to wait for the elevators. The restaurants did not appeal to us at Bally's. Coffee was much better in Paris than at the Java Coast stand by the Casino. The pool was nothing special, but fine for sunning and cooling off.

The indoor access to Paris was most convenient so that you felt you were staying in both hotels. Bally's is also connected via the Monorail to many other hotels which was useful. The staff were very efficient but the hotel is so huge there was no personal touch - everyone is extremely professional and everything is set up for convenience - a dedicated desk for booking tours and shows was very useful and the baggage service on our last day was excellent.

We were forced to use the inroom telephone to call internationally a few times and EACH 10 second call home to say \"call me back!\" racked up a $17 connection charge!

Here's My Review : Check In: - This was the only slight dissapointment in Bally's services. As per advice from many others, decided to try to check in to Bally's at their Airport registration desk. I politely asked for a non-smoking King Bed room on a high floor in the newly renovated North Tower. The rude older lady quickly retorted that all North Tower rooms required a $20/night upgrade fee..no exceptions. I had a 20 under my credit card as a tip, but she pretended not to see it. She even said that the room wasn't ready yet and that we had to pick up keys at the front desk of Bally's. Though I was glad to get the North Tower, I wasn't happy that I had to pay $120 for the \"luxory\" (20*6 nights). When we got to Bally's there was only 3 people in line on an early Sunday evening. Should have just checked in person there. They had a room, but it only had a Queen, but they compensated that with a free fridge, a couch and extra chairs and a huge bathroom with seperate vanity area. We were impressed when we walked in. Room : The north tower rooms look like the pictures on the web site. Modern, CLEAN and HUGE. Bed was comfortable, view was of the north strip (Flamingo, Wynn,etc..). Room was at the end of a long hall but the hallway was extremely quiet. Neighbors were quiet, and stay was very peaceful. Room included hair dryer, ironing board/iron, nice size TV on a swivel stand within an armoire and other usual decor/amenities. Soaps and shampoos were of good quality, and shower nice and hot though not the best pressure. Bed was very comfortable and air conditioning worked like a charm and was fully adjustable. Services : Room service never intruded early in the morning and brought extra pillows and towels when requested. I recommend tipping housekeeping $5/day. They clean your toilet and bath and bed...why wouldn't you want them to do the best job possible? All hotel personnel from the dealers, waitresses, desk cleks, cashiers etc were very pleasant and helpful. All wished us luck in our gambling and inquired if we were enjoying our stay. Pool/Amenities : Yes, the walk to the pool is long from both North and South Towers. The trick in the North Tower is to choose the Pool Level button that brings you to the basement and not to the casino. The pool itself is nice, has a deep end and good towel service. Not the fanciest pool in town, but you should be able to find a chair anytime of day. Restaurants : We only dined in 2 restaurants : Chang's -Chinese Restaurant - This was excellent but pricey americanized chinese food . Gourmet Dinner for 2 that had 2 appetizers, 2 coctails, 4 entres and a dessert was slightly over $100 for the two of us, Johnny's Delicatessan was visited twice for quick bagels in the morning. Yummy! Location & Value: It would be hard pressed to choose a better location on the strip for the price (Flamingo would be similar in ranking as pervalue/location). Bally's has the monorail station in the back to ride to the south strip (MGM) and up the north strip. It has good taxi services and bus stop northbound and across the strip at the Bellagio southbound. It's walking distance to ponts north as far as Wynn if you are fit/agile and south to MGM/Tropicana. Odds&Ends : Bally's probably has the oldest dealers and coctail waitresses on the strip. Not the most attractive ones either but they do the job. The bartenders make darn strong and good cocktails. ! Overall : It's not the hippest, loudest. best thematic hotel/casino on the strip. But if you value great location, comfortable rooms that give you a good nights sleep and good services...Bally's should be on the top of your list ! P.S.

Since I haven't seen the South Tower rooms, I can not say if it's worth paying more for the North Tower or not. I thought the room was pretty good. It was big and was true to the picture on the website. There was a one cup coffee maker in the bathroom and from reading other reviews I don't know if this is just in the North Tower or not. I liked the decor, not overwhelming. The bathroom floor though.. if you miss the bathmat after getting out of the shower, you'll be hurting. I really liked the pool area too. It's a nice big pool with areas to sit around the perimeter and just hang out. The water wasn't ice cold either. The only bad part is no umbrellas for shade. There is about one row of loungers by the eatery for shade but get up early to snag those. That's about the only negative I saw at the pool area. Some people can't be in the sun all day. I would say the only negative I had about the hotel portion was housekeeping. It was TERRIBLE. I had to hunt down a cart and snag toilet paper because it was never replenshed and we were out.

So I'll recommend that if all possible, ask for a room in the North Tower coz it's more enjoyable. And for the price, it's definitely above average.

It's just a short walk from Bally's - it's behind the hotel, and they have the sign up saying they have $4.95 special. Their root beer and drafts were good too, be sure to try it! We ate at a few different buffets in hotels, such as Bellagio, Mirage, Paris & Golden Nuggets, and they were all very good. If you are looking for a cheap and good deal, I would recommend Golden Nuggets' lunch buffet. As for transportation, we got a day pass for the Deuce 1 day, and also for the Trolley for another day - I would say the Deuce's a better choice if you don't mind walking a little coz you can also ride on different systems with the same pass, and the air conditioning is much stronger.", "Date": "July 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saratoga Springs, NY", "Title": "\u201cGood Choice\u201d", "Author": "Saratogatraveler", "ReviewID": "UR5462581", "Content": "Spent four days at Bally's July 7-11.

We asked for rooms in the North Tower based on reviews on this site but were told there were none available. We decided to take our chances with the South Tower and were pleasntly surprised to find the rooms were very spacious and spotlessly clean. The decor was a bit dated but who cares, you don't go to Vegas to study interion design. Our view on the 10th floor was of Caesars and Barbary Coast which didn't bother us as the rooms were only used for sleeping and showering. The bathroom was big, clean and had plenty of clean towels and toiletries. We ate dinner at the Big Kitchen Buffet on 3 occasions with mixed success - once was excellent, once was OK and once the selection was very poor. Having said that it was fine for breakfast. \"Nosh\" at the bottom of the South Tower elevators does a fine breakfast bagel with a wide selection of fillings. For dinner I would recommend the buffets at Paris or the new Wynn, although this is more expensive and the queue can be quite long - go early. Do not eat at the buffet in Caesar's - this was the worst food I've had on 3 trips to LV. The casion was quite big, clean and not at all smokey. They laid new carpet in the casino while we were there and this gave the place a slightly \"newer\" feel. The waitress service was very good - never more than 3 minutes waiting, although I had to ask for more coke with my Black Russian which was very strong. This was not a problem and I didn't have to ask again for the rest of the trip - Great service, Thanks Monica. The walk to the pool is very long (I was surprised to discover how big this hotel really is, very deceiving from the outside) but the pool is clean and well maintained.

The location is great, the service was wonderful and upon check in they gave me the location of room that I requested. I wanted to be able to see the Bellagio Fountains and I was accomodated. Elevators are fast and plentiful. I never had to wait for one. I stayed in the North Tower(of course) on the 21st floor and had a great room at the end of the hall.. The room was big and not the most well appointed I've seen but the size and the conveniences in the room more than made up for lack of beauty and who spends time in the room anyway!. The bathroom and the dressing area is well lit-lots of mirrors and closet space, drawer space and that is all I cared about. Getting ready for the evening was easy with those accomodations. I had a couch and two chairs which never got used nor did the big dining room table! Housekeeping got me whatever I wanted-(for a small price-I left $5 evrytime I needed something). My room had a safe and a refrigerator in it, the latter being free and the safe was only $3 per day. I always had iced tea or juice in the refrigerator so when I woke up in the morning with dry mouth......could take a swig of cold juice. No coffee maker in the room tho but there is coffee everywhere for $2.75. The cafe at the pool told me I could have a free refill of coffee. The walk to the pool is no big deal at all. There is an elevator in the North Tower that goes right down to the pool level and its a pleasant walk, if you can walk. If you have a hard time walking..........well, Vegas isn't for you anyway!!!! The location is great, the walkways to the Paris and the Bellagio is such a convenience. The walkway to the Bellagio puts you right into their shopping mall but then you can take the walkway from therer to the forum shops at Ceasars...you couldn't ask for a better spot. I walked through the Paris to get to the Aladdin's wonderful shopping mall which is a must. So I was outside in the heat walking for that extended of a period. Everything I needed was at my fingertips. The pool service was terrific, I never found myself looking for a cocktail waitress and the service at the pool cafe where I ate breakfast everyday was just as accomodating. I ordered breakfast, they recommended what they thought I would like based on what the majority ordered. Breakfast Burrito, and a small fruit bowl-fresh as can be. Lunch was a turkey wrap that was huge and then in between my cocktails I drank water which was readily available at the bar-they have a cooler of water and a bucket of ice with cups at your disposal. What more can you ask for?? Friendly atmosphere. You can't go wrong. The show at the Indigo Lounge in the casino area was absolutely great. We sat in the front row and danced with the band, they are like the old Temptations-very entertaining. Cocktail service was great in the lounge as well. NEGATIVES-no big winning. I stayed alive with the slots but that is about it. I entered the slot tournament. That was fun . Its free if you register for your rewards card which is a must also if you are going to gamble. Your rewards card entitles you to a 10-15% discouunt in all of the affilitated hotel shops that are hotel owned. IE-Rio, Paris, Ballys, Flamingo and Ceasars. The \"NOSH\" in the back corner near the Big Buffet is a great late night snack place. That was the only place we found open for a sandwich at !0:00 PM. Everything is sooooo fresh. Don't forget to walk over to Barbary Coast-on the opposite corner of Bally's-to see Big Elvis-from 3-6 everyday. Also, I recommend using the side door to get to the Barbary Coast-you don't have to deal with the slow moving walkways. There is a free shuttle as well to the Rio(on the side entrance) if you want to visit the Voo Doo Lounge at the top to watch the sunset and the 'lights of Vegas\" sparkle. What a sight. Get there before 8:00 or you will have to pay $20 to get into the Lounge. Cocktails are $10.50 but the view makes it all worth it. A Coke was $8.00 so you might as well have a martini.", "Date": "June 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, California", "Title": "\u201cNASCAR WEEKEND\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5323206", "Content": "We stayed here for Nascar Weekend got rates at $159 + tax per night for the first two noghts and $99 for he last night. This is a great rate for that weekend. We checked in at the airport even though we drove from California we wanted a quicker check in the process took about 25 minutes and that is pretty fast onthe busy weekend. The airport check in are always very helpful and I've always got a nice room in the North Tower. I;ve stayed on the 16th and 14th floors here. I like staying here because I love the Sports Book very large, Plus there is a sopparra pizza, NY pretzel and a lil deli right off the side of the sports book. Also We enjoy Battista's restraunt located just next door on Audry it is the best place to eat. Also the rooms are always very clean I have stayed at the palms and also the Hard rock and it's like both of those places have a bad cleaning staff my rooms always turn up something left behind or dirty counter tops etc. Bally's room are always very clean. I agree the casino smells of smoke bad due to the low ceilings, I don't ever like to gamble here as I don't win but other surrounding casinos are a better bet. We have eaten at the Buffet, the side walk cafe and they are pretty good not great. Room service is always nice. Monorail is very close and conveinant if you buy a 24 hour pass its like ten or 15 bucks and worth it so you can drink al day and night and not have to worry about driving and at the same time ride all over. Never saw a show here but we did see the \"V\" show at the Venetian and liked that a lot. Never got to use the pool here but it looked like your basic pool. ALl and all I'll give Bally's a thumbs up However hearing that Harrah's Bought them (Harrahs rate are alwys so high) I proboly will never stay again if the rates climb as yu mught as well stay at the Bellagio Or MGM for Alot less.

Ballys is in a great location on the strip, easy access to alot of great attractions. Ballys is actually connected to Paris so it is like getting two casinos, several resturants and shops in one. The only downfall of this hotel is the pool area, it is far from the room and you have to walk through a casino area, by resturants and shops in your swim gear to get there. Although the service by the pool was great the pool itself is kinda old and needs a little makeover. Lastly, we stayed there with our 6 year old daughter, she had a great time by the pool but I do have to say she was probably the only kid staying at the hotel.

Would stay there again if price is right, but probably would explore another location next time--south part of strip. North part of strip: Circus, circus, etc I found to be depressing and old.

It was our first trip out to Sin City and we were pleased with the accommodations that Bally\u2019s offered. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Bally\u2019s is no 5 star hotel, but its no \u2018Joe\u2019s Hideaway Inn\u2019 either. But let\u2019s get to it\u2026 Check-in \u2013 We checked in at McCarran Airport and found the staff to be very knowledgeable and accommodating. We requested a North tower room as most people seem to do, and we were surprised when they had a non-smoking room available for us at 11:30am. The woman at the counter also gave us advise on how to get to the hotel cheaply (remember to tell the cab driver NOT to take the tunnel). The room \u2013 Having checked in at the airport we were able to cruise right past the lengthy check-in line at Bally\u2019s and go right to our room. It was spacious and nicely decorated with a couple of desks, two queen beds, and a comfortable chair. The bathroom had marble floors and counters and offered the standard hotel amenities but the room did not include a coffee maker, mini-bar, or a free safe (you had to pay $3.00 per day to use it). Our view was of Flamingo Road and the northern strip which was nice, though light sleepers may want to consider staying elsewhere as the ambulance sirens can be heard throughout the night. It should be noted that some of our party stayed next door at the Paris and their room was comparable to ours except they had one extra bench, free safe, bright blue carpet, and a mini-bar. I would have to say, however, that if I had to choose between the two hotels, I would sacrifice the expensive booze at Paris for the discount rates at Bally\u2019s. The location \u2013 I read tons of reviews claiming that Bally\u2019s is in a prime location, right in the center of the strip. This is true, but it doesn\u2019t really matter because EVERYWHERE you go in Vegas will involve more walking than you might expect. It would take us around 10 to 15 minutes to walk from our room across the moving sidewalks crowded with standing people along for the ride, up an escalator, and across the street to Belagio or Caesar\u2019s Palace. The monorail station and pool are also a hike across the lower level of the hotel. The best part about the location is that Bally\u2019s and Paris are practically seamlessly connected via a clutter of bakeries and Parisian themed restaurants (the Nutella crepes are well worth the $6.95). The food \u2013 We only ate at the Bally\u2019s buffet once for breakfast. Save your $12.95 and go over to the Paris for their breakfast buffet. It is the same price and noticeably better. The drinks at Bally\u2019s were expensive if you weren\u2019t playing. I spent $6.00 for a Corona one night after my first two only cost $1.00 each for a tip. Gaming and Entertainment \u2013 We didn\u2019t play too much at Bally\u2019s because the casino was relatively small and busy compared to the adjacent Paris and Aladdin. I did play cards for a while in the tiny poker room which required no wait on a Saturday night and in which the pit staff gets your chips for you so you can jump right into the game. We were able to get great Saturday night Jubilee tickets for $77.00 per ticket ($5 off for hotel guests) but I hear they are offered for cheaper elsewhere on the strip. The show was a lot more extravagant than I thought a topless, rhinestone and feather costume performance would offer \u2013 definitely worth a look. Overall we would stay at Bally\u2019s again if the price is right. The location is relatively convenient to other properties and the renovated rooms are in pretty good condition. Besides sleeping and maybe a litte gambling, this is probably not the exciting Vegas hotel you would want to spend your whole day at, but you will feel safe and possibly see a great show while you are there.", "Date": "May 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london, england", "Title": "\u201cBad front desk service and worrying fire alarm proceedure\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5186643", "Content": "Stayed seven nights in South Tower. On arrival asked for north tower room but was told company policy is to charge for this. Firstly, I was offered $35 extra per night to get the north tower room. This would include breakfast buffet and spa mambership for partner and myself. When I declined this, I was then offered the room at $20 per night extra (something I had seen others prev write here also). I then tried waving a print out of traveladvisor showing people got free upgrades but to no advail. The excuse this time was that upgrades are given to people spending only a few nights there. This sounds like poor business practise to me as it would be better to keep on the right side of someone spending money over 7 days in town, rather than just two nights. I didnt gamble there as a result of this poor service, and was glad. The surrounding casinos are alot nicer and more spacious. AT 4AM ON SECOND NIGHT, WAS WOKEN BY VOICE OVER TANOY IN ROOM SAYING FIRE ALARM HAD GONE OFF AND THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEM, AND TO STAY ALERT FOR UPDATES. AS A RESULT, GOT DRESSED AND WAITED FOR MORE INFO. IT NEVER CAME. AFTER 30 MINS LATER I WENT DOWN TO THE FRONT DESK TO BE TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD TOUCHED THE FIRE ALARM BY MISTAKE. WHEN ASKED WHY WASNT A SECOND MESSAGE BROADCAST INTO THE ROOMS, FONT DESK LADY IMMEDIATELY FOBBD ME OFF WITH \"THEY ARE WORKING ON THAT\". THE SECOND MESSAGE NEVER CAME. SEEING AS THIS HOTEL USED TO BE THE MGM GRAND UNTIL A FIRE CLAIMED SEVERAL LIVES HERE, I CONSIDER THIS BORDERING ON THE NEGLEGENT AND INSENSITIVE. Having said that, the room in the south tower was large and had a great view of the paris and down the strip to ny-ny. The furniture is stuck in the 80's and should had been renovated long ago. The main lamp was broken into 3 pieces and had been stuck together. Bathroom was aveage and again showing signs of age. The toliet was too low to the floor. Big tv was good but $3 charge a day to use the room safe - rip off. The reason this hotel gets two circles is for its location and great little coffee shop by the buffet escalators. If going to the breakfast buffet, save some cash and get a ham, egg and cheese bagel from NOSH, its large enough to fill you up and save $10. Service is brilliant here and these people should be promoted to front of house. Buffet looks tired again and a bit run down, walk throught the adjoinging paris hotel to the aladin, which does great spice market buffet. The pool is halfway out to the hard rock hotel, at the back next to the momorail but is nice and deep enough for a proper swim. Excellent set of tunes blasting out. Sports book is huge but lacks atmosphere, go across to ceasrs palace, osheas or bellagio. If you stay here, use it as a cheap base and go out and explore, theres alot better waiting for you casinos out there.

Once again my stay at Bally\u2019s Las Vegas was quite a pleasant one. The rooms are still the same size (approximately 450 square feet, larger than most standard rooms in Las Vegas), and the room that I stayed in was recently renovated (see the picture). Some of the hotel\u2019s shops and restaurants have changed since the acquisition of Park Place Entertainment (with includes Bally\u2019s, Paris, Caesar\u2019s Palace, amongst others) by Harrah\u2019s Entertainment. My room was located on the 26th floor of what I thought was the North Tower. The room was nice and clean, except for a used condom that I found in the hallway outside of the room. The hotel was very quiet despite the large amount of guests staying at the hotel; I\u2019ve never had a problem with noise while at Bally\u2019s. The bathroom was clean and had marble countertops and floors. One bad point that I experienced was the extremely long wait for extra towels from housekeeping. As for the casino, the table games have upped their minimums. I was there for a midweek to weekend stay and there were no $5 tables at any point in time. Ten-dollar tables are easily found and are generally open with the exception of peak hours. With the arrival of a new owner, Harrah\u2019s Entertainment has come higher room rates. There is a significant increase in Bally\u2019s room rates on weekends and peak days; prices that rival luxury hotels. Example: On Saturday June 24th, 2006 Bally\u2019s is going for $299 while Bellagio goes for $359. Rates in general have increased between 30 to 40 percent. Still, Bally\u2019s offers a center-of-it-all location and overall good service. In the past, I would not have hesitated to say that Bally\u2019s offered the best value on the strip.

That was voted the best buffet by the locals. We agree! It's fantastic! It's true that when in Vegas, a person usually does not plan to spend much time in their hotel room, but, you might want to kick back and relax a while. So, pick a great hotel. All the nice things you do for yourself add up and make the trip a great experience. Great night time views are from the top of the Eifel Tower and from the Voodoo Lounge at the Rio.

My review of Bally's is partly probably tinted a bit by my then newfound love of Vegas as a vacation spot, and should be viewed as such. With that said, I LOVED my trip to Vegas and stay at Bally's!! I asked for a room with a view and got a big room looking at Paris' Eiffel Tower and off the right right the fountains of Bellagio (later stayed at Bellagio and got a true view, which I liked immensely). The room was really big and the bathroom big and well lit. The windows were HUGE so standing and looking down south strip was a lot of fun at night. Now, the casino was just a regular casino, but it also connects with Paris, so you have two in one, one themed, and one not. That also meant having access to dining and shopping from both areas. I loved the basic sidewalk (near shopping area) cafe because it had a REALLY good big noodle soup which I crave now. There was a good mix of reasonably priced places as well as high end places. I don't usually go for the high end restaurants, but if I did, I would opt for Bellagio's fine dining, or maybe Paris. We had a couple of pool days because our stay was in the hot season. I loved the fact that there weren't millions of kids at Bally's with which to share the pool. Their poolside drinks were incredible along with the drink service. We had no trouble finding lounge chairs. The only drawback was the LONGGGGGGGGGG walk from our tower to the pool.

Plenty of towels, glasses, extra toilet paper and kleenix, and soaps - even some mouthwash. The casino was not nearly as smoky as I thought it would be. I have a high sensitivity to smoke, but was hardly bothered at all in Bally's or Paris. I loved that in all the restrooms I went in, the automatic faucets delivered warm water! The Big Kitchen Cafe served a tasty brunch on Saturday. Gone are the days of the cheap brunch, but it was reasonably priced. Orantique on the Paris side was superb for dinner and worth every cent.

I have stayed in many hotels on the strip and in downtown, and so far for the money, Bally's has my vote. If you want luxury and pampering, pay the money and go to the Venetian or Bellagio. If you just want space, comfort, and service, then Bally's ranks right up there. We had planned on checking in at the airport, but after wrestling our way to our bags and being stressed by inconsiderate people and crowds in the airport, we didn't even bother looking for the check in desk. We just hit a cab and went to the hotel to check in there. No problem with check in lines. We got early check in with no problem; though I don't think they offer the same upgrades at the hotel that they do at the airport. I didn't think there would be any difference, but when I asked for an upgrade, I was handed a book that listed a \"renovated\" room for an extra $20 per night, you don't want to know what a real upgrade costs. We decided to go with what we had. We got a south tower room and I am happy to say that it wouldn't have been worth it for an \"upgraded\" north tower room. Our room was absolutely huge compared to most rooms. The bed was comfortable, the maid service great, a sitting area and a large bathroom. I will agree with previous reviews that say that the shower pressure leaves something to be desired. The water is hot and the shower is great, but you cannot adjust the shower head. So, if you are spoiled to massage shower heads, you might be dissapointed. The showers spray and that is it. But, I paid 3 times the price for a room at Harrahs and that room was so cramped and crammed, I will tradean adjustable shower head for some comfort and space(not to mention the $$$ savings). If you are in the south tower, your elevators are just to the right of the entrance which is nice. Just a few steps from that elevator is Nosh which serves wonderful pastries and strong coffee, a few more steps and you are at the Java (something) that has better coffee. As far as room service prices, they are the best I have seen so far. I wouldn't complain about almost $8 plus a $2 room service fee for a pot of coffee when I have paid over $22 for it at a less comfortable hotel. Another thing about Bally's is that the casino is wide and open and rarely crowded. You can actually walk through the place. They have the shoppe avenue and then there is a mall that connects them to the Paris. No, the rooms don't have a coffee pot or a fridge, but really, do you expect them to at the price? They have hair dryers and ironing board/iron. As far as ammenities, for the price I can't see how you can expect more. If you don't want to order room service or travel down for coffee, then bring your own pot. There is plenty of room for you to set it up in. We intended to, but ran off & left the thing. Price, location, room comfort, service; on all of those things I think Bally's rates 5 stars. The rooms are very clean, and very comfortable. I'd rather stay here and pay less for a great room yet be right in the middle of all of the action in just a few steps.

Over the years, we've stayed at many hotels -- Stardust, Circus Circus, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, Flamingo, Imperial Palace and Mirage to name a few. We usually just try to get the best deal on the strip when booking our trips. Bally's happened to be the best deal at the time of booking using an online travel booking service. Upon arrival in Vegas, we could not locate the airport check-in counter (different terminal?) but check-in at the hotel was quick and fairly painless (a bit of an attitude and feeling rushed by attendant though). Travelled with our kids and elderly parents and we were appointed two rooms close to each other, located in the South Tower. Had I known better, I would've booked the North Tower instead (have to walk through the casino to get to the South elevators...not something I enjoy doing with my kids but then again, this is Vegas). Rooms were okay...nothing fancy but clean. Windows don't open which was a negative for us as we enjoy fresh air, especially while sleeping. But had a great view of the Eiffel Tower and partial view of Bellagio's fountains. Bathroom was a good size but tub was a bit small and there was not much pressure from the shower head. Really miss having a coffeemaker in the room but was able to buy fairly decent coffees each morning right downstairs from our room. Enjoyed the hotel buffet several times but breakfast was especially good there. And the restaurant itself was impressive and had actual, real daylight (not often found in Vegas restaurants!!). Did not use the pool as it was too cold that week in Vegas to do much of anything outside. Really liked the close proximity to the strip and other hotels (Caesars, Bellagio, Paris)...easy and quick to get to from inside the hotel lobby. Parking is shared with Paris and quite a hike to get to from our room. This was probably the biggest complaint as we had rented a car and drove around a lot. Slots were okay -- paid sometimes and not other times. Casino has plenty of 'penny' slots, which were great for my parents who enjoy gambling alot. Drink service while playing slots was not reliable (we tip $1 per order). Used the handy TV check-out service which worked great (nothing extra or unusual showed up on my credit card bill).

Our biggest complaint is all about cigarette smoke, so if you don't mind smoke, it may be the place for you. Upon checkin, we asked what upgrades were available, and we paid an extra $109/night for a suite on Floor 11, a posted, non-smoking floor. Early Sunday morning, our suite 1161 filled up with cigarette smoke from room 1161A, which was separated by a door, not a wall. We complained to the manager, Daryl, who was not happy with US, but later the smoke had cleared, only to reappear on Monday am. Later on Sunday, the hall was filled with smoke from room 1162, you could see it coming out from under the door. Ugh!! We complained again, and the problem was caused by the other guests not the hotel, but, we won't be back. The casino smoke became overwhelming also. They will propbably never ban smoking, but they could manage the ventilation systems if they tried.. They do at the Mirage and at the new Wynn. On the plus side, the staff were well trained and very eager to help. The breakfast buffet was the best we've seen, very large selection of very high quality, well-prepared food, very attractively presented. The Steakhouse restaurant met/exceeded our expectations. Good piece of ribeye (if you want the best, you need to go to Mortons,Ruths, Smith at much greater cost), cooked just right. Exquisite onion rings, fries perfectly done, and a great banana cream pie my wife said was the best she had ever had. On the other hand, stay away from the deli next to Sbarro's by the Sports Bar on the P level. My Reuben sandwich left a puddle on my plate and the corned beef had lots of fat, I couldn't finish it. If you like fresh Asian food, Noodles in Bellagio is our favorite, and Redd in Wynns is very good also. The cocktail waitresses in Wynn are the best looking on the strip, all beautiful. Be sure and visit Wynn and Bellagio for the beautifully finished main lobbies and gardens. We see many shows, this time KA at MGM, very very good, and nerve-racking at times, in fear that the performers may fall. Still, \"O\" at Bellagio is the best show of all time with Zumanity at the bottle of the Cirque offerings. Celine is great but does many covers of others' work, when her own body of work is so extensive and that's what you want to here. Penn & Teller will disappoint anyone over age 8 and LaFemme at MGM will be appreciated by everone who appreciates the female body without requiring it to be a turnon.

The only problem with the north tower rooms are the sirens and ambulances that you can hear at night because the hospital is on Flamingo Road about 5 miles east of Bally's. Otherwise, we were both very satisfied with our room. Bally's pool was closed and drained of all it's water but the pool and hot tub at Paris, which Bally's guests are allowed to use, was open from 10:00am-5:00p.m. To all the people who have written reviews that the casino is smokey, ALL CASINOS ARE SMOKEY - that's the way it is! Bally's casino is very easy to navigate. There are some casinos that are so confusing and laid out terribly - not Bally's. Had no problem finding the rest of the gang we were with when we went our separate ways gambling. Make sure you sign up for a Total Rewards card as soon as you get there (if your going to gamble). You also get a discount on all Bally's/Paris gift shop purchases with that card (whether you gamble or not). The monorail stops at Ballys but it is pretty expensive. $5.00 one way for one person or $9.00 one way for two people. All day pass is $15.00 a person and runs until about 3:00am or 4:00 am. It also runs behind the hotels so you really don't get a good view of all the hotels and action. We thought the better transportation option was the trolley. $5.00 gets you an all day pass and you can get on and off as many times as you want. They trolley stops right in front of Bally's just beyond the taxi drop off and it starts at 9:30am and ends at 1:30am. Great views of the strip and all the action. Took a craps class at the Venitian Hotel to learn the game a little better. Best thing we did. FREE class started at 11:00am, lasted 1/2 hour and at the end of the class they gave each person $15.00 of hotel money to use towards table games. Very nice! There are quite a few hotels who offer classes in craps, black jack, poker, etc. Find out about them and take advantage of them! Unfortunately Bally's did not offer any classes but Barbarry Coast right across the street does offer classes. Best dinner we had was at the Steak House Restaurant in Circus Circus. Didn't care for the hotel but the restaurant was excellent. Half the price of Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio, and the quality was just as good. Atmosphere was elegant fine dining. Rented a car and drove to the Hover Dam. Took us less then an hour to get there. Unbelievable sight! Also drove through and had lunch at Lake Las Vegas, very nice!

Our stay was between Dec 29-Jan 1. What a blast! If anyone has considered spending New Years Eve in Las Vegas and haven\u2019t had a chance, make it a point to go. It is one NON STOP PARTY! I am 45; my wife is 46, so we aren\u2019t kids. But we like to have a good time. We socialized with everyone from 21 years old to 70. The only difference between us and the 20 year olds is that we required naps. Everyone we encountered was smiling, drinking, and just having a great time! More about the party later. As usual, we left Connecticut at 5am, got into airport at 10:50am Nevada time. If you take the taxi to Ballys and he takes you through the tunnel, don\u2019t tip him! He is taking the long way and he is ripping you off. Cab fair should about 12 bucks and the drive should be from Paradise to Flamingo to Ballys. Limos are typically $75.00 one way. Arriving at Ballys we had our bags taken from the bellman and preceded to the check in desk about 11:20am. The line was long but moved very fast. We got to the desk about 10 minutes and were given our complimentary room in the South Tower. Other people we heard had to wait for their room but we had no problem checking in early once again. This could contribute to a smoking room request. Called the bellman to bring up our bags, and he arrived at our door ten minutes later. Tipped the bell hop and got ready for the day. I have read some complaining about the South Tower. Granted, it is not as new as the North Tower but there are no problems with Housekeeping at all! Some people are harder to please. They should go another hotel at 300 dollar a night. But if you are in Vegas, how long are you staying in the room, anyways? Since the room is free, I usually end up in the older tower. But it has always been clean and the king size bed is roomy and comfortable. If you want a view of the strip you must request it. The shower was missing the floor mat. I asked one of the maids the next room over to get me one so I don\u2019t slip and break my head while showering. Five minutes later she knocked on the door with the mat with a smile on her face. I tipped her a five dollar bill and she was so thankful, her smile turned into a glow. They work very hard for very little money. During the first night, my wife shut the door to the bathroom and the corner marble tile fell off the wall with a resounding bang! Startled by the sound, we both had a good laugh. We just left it there because it was not in the way of anything and it was directly underneath the sink. Later, I hoped that my wife and I didn\u2019t get into an argument, remembering the loose tile, and find her hitting me over the head with it. Get a connection card. Even if you don\u2019t really gamble that much, it will be to your advantage. All restaurants, including Ballys Steakhouse, will give you 10% off your entire bill. They won\u2019t ask for the card. They won\u2019t tell you about it the discount. Just hand the card to the server when paying your bill. If you do gamble, put all dinners on your room. This way, when checking out, any comps that you\u2019ve earned can be deducted from the room bill. Personally, we like room service. Except for New Years Eve, we had our meals rolled into the room within 45 minutes after ordering. However, New Years was a 4 hour wait. So we went down the Tequila Bar, had a very delicious Quasadeas and Tacos appetizers, served with 4 different sauces, with two extremely large Margaritas at the tune of $45.00 less 10% (connection card). Phoning in room service the next day we made sure our fat intake was well satisfied with Philly Cheese Steaks, Cheeseburgers, and Shrimp Cocktail. All very good eating, always been served hot and, like anything else in Vegas, available 24 hours a day. On the casino floor, I never, ever, had a problem getting drinks. Even on a very busy New Years Eve. This is why. When I receive my first drink after sitting down at a blackjack table or slot machine, I tip my first drink 3 to 5 dollars. Few people know this but all waitresses in Las Vegas have to pay taxes on every drink they serve. Part of your token goes to paying that tax. So if you don\u2019t tip them the first time around, although the drink is free to you, it is not to the person who is serving it. Don\u2019t expect to see your waitress anytime in the near future. Tipping well the first time, and then a buck or so after, will secure frequent visits from your hostess while gambling. On to New Years Eve party at the Strip. Being older and, supposedly wiser, I had inquired about safety on Las Vegas Blvd at New Years. The strip is closed down to traffic for the party goers. Gucci Fireworks puts on a synchronized show from the roof tops of ten casinos which is an awesome sight to see. People everywhere drinking, yelling and screaming. Having a great time but not out of control. You can\u2019t have bottles or cans out like normal, but drinks in plastic are ok. Las Vegas had a very heavy police presence which made it very safe. The police are great and don\u2019t interfere with the partying unless you violate a rule. So my wife and I ventured out to the strip to see the fireworks show. It wasn\u2019t a disappointment. It was spectacular! Unless you are claustrophobic, you are in for a real experience. It is wall to wall people and the synergy was incredible! People were just having a great time and we had absolutely no problem mingling in with the 300,000 people who left planet Earth and came to Vegas. With a two hour nap, my wife and I were good to go till 3am. Whoohoo! Ballys have never been a disappointment to me. From the pit bosses all the way down to the chamber maids, Ballys had always come though for us. All in all, the rooms, employees, and the attitudes, have always been all good. I have found that if you are nice to the people who wait on you or provide a service, in turn, you will be treated fairly with a smile. Don\u2019t think that if you have a problem with the service, and it does happen, that screaming and carrying on like a spoiled brat is going to get you good results. Ballys\u2019 personnel will try to resolve any issues you have. It is all on how you approach them is the key. So if you are up to a good trip to Vegas, Ballys will treat you right.

This has been our third time here. Yes, there are two towers and the south tower is the non-renovated one. Unfortunately this tower is more convenient to the meeting rooms and they also face the midstrip so you'll get excellent views of the Bellagio dancing fountains and the \"Eiffel Tower\". Therefore, we always request a south tower room. The above are the great things about our Ballys stay. Now for the bad: Rooms need renovating and maintenance: The south tower rooms dearly need renovating and maintaining. The decor is past being tired and worn. Currently the decor is circa 1980's. Our other bathrooms in the south tower were allright, but during our current stay the bathroom, while fine with the large marble countertop, needs to be renovated immediately. The shower is horrible with the head missing part of the spray attachment so you get blasted with a 'fire hose' effect, there is terrible moldy grout between the (white) tiles, the shower door has seen better days, and the ceiling light/fan fixture is missing a cover. Poor housekeeping: No good housekeeping is available at Ballys. At least in our current room there isn't. Room service menus were taken out from the hotel info. binder but were not replaced. Laundry bags were not replaced as well. The room had terrible dust next to and behind the beds and anywhere that's not in the forefront; obviously the housekeepers are not doing a good job. Hear and feel every noise: The rooms have zero insulation so you hear every single movement, TV show, and conversation (including arguments). You can hear door slamming from not only your next door neighbors but also from your fellow guests down the hallway. Guests are so stupid and disrespectful of other guests that they allow their doors to slam and bang no matter what hour of the day or night and the noise resonates in your room. Kids and adults run up and down the corridors and this is very disturbing too. Our next door neighbors were slamming their doors from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. and also their kids (?) were running around inside the room for a while. We tried to sleep but would be awakened rudely with the noises. As it went on for hours we had to call security to have them talk to them. In conclusion, if you want a moderately priced hotel with a great mid-Strip location, this is it. But remember it comes in the price of poor housekeeping, badly maintained south tower rooms, and there is a 100% chance that your noisy neighbors will keep you awake.", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradenton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAnother great Bally's stay!\u201d", "Author": "Troy34215", "ReviewID": "UR4252534", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at Ballys from 12/11-12/15 in the South Tower.

The poker room at Ballys is no-frills, but the players are friendly and they run daily low buy-in ($55) tournaments. The Bellagio poker room defies explanation as it is the finest and most comfortable room I\u2019ve had the pleasure of playing in. Not to mention that you will be, literally, rubbing elbows with the biggest names in poker: Ivey, Farha, Hellmuth, Brunson, etc. 2.) Have dinner at the Binion\u2019s Ranch Steakhouse downtown!

Didn't complain (not the British way) but would in the future. The room was excellent though, especially for what you pay here. It was very clean, a great size (much bigger than TI). The casino is not huge but is linked directly to Paris Hotel via a cobbled walkway. The slots are great & the comps are OK. The hotel is in a perfect location, right in the heart of the strip, across from the Bellagio (linked by a walkway & bridge).

There is now a monorail stop right at the hotel (Perfect for anyone less mobile) but I would be worried about it now because it cuts between the main hotel & the pool. There are loads of places to eat at Ballys. The best was the steak house though I did have a fly in my glass of wine. It was changed and refunded easily enough though I didn't like the attitude of the waiter when doing so. At that time the Buffet was great & on that trip we said it was the best we went to.

It was extremely important for me to find the best value for my money, without having to sacrifice too much \"creature comfort (I'm a \"Bellagio/Venetian\" type of gal). Bally's fit the bill perfectly. This is not a \"luxury\" hotel. This is a very good hotel. I am used to luxury hotel rooms and was pleased enough with my \"standard\" room that I did not feel compelled to request an upgrade. However, I must admit, I stayed in the newer North Tower. Apparently, these rooms do not have the prized direct views of the strip that can be found in the older rooms in the South Tower. I was okay with that. I still had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains from my window. The housekeeping was superb. Of course that could have been because I left a few dollars for the housekeeper every day. However, on my first night, I spilled grape juice all over the carpet. Because housekeeping was dilligent in coming right away to clean it up, the next guest will not have to critique \"stains on the carpet\" in their review. In general, I found all the staff to be pleasant and courteous. My room was a good size, with a queen size bed (although I did request a king), 2 sitting chairs with table, a couch with coffee table and a dining table with 4 chairs. The bathroom was also a nice size, not huge, but not tiny. There was also a vanity area right outside the bathroom. All in all, a great room for under $100 a night (except on the weekend when all LV hotel rates shoot up). The one negative I have is the bed. It was kind of strange. It was comfortable, but it seemed to be on some kind of platform with sharp edges. I went home with a bruised ankle from walking into the edge one too many times. As for the casino, I can't comment other than to say it was \"airy\", not smokey and everyone seemed to be having a good time. I did not play at all. I ate dinner at Bally's 24 hour restaurant, The Sidewalk Cafe, but was not impressed. However, I LOVED the buffet at the Big Kitchen. It was much better than the one at the Mirage. I ordered room service only once, breakfast, and it was outstanding! Everything was hot and very tasty. Checking in and out was a breeze as I arrived and departed at non peak times.

The second manager then bumped us to a suite in the North Tower with a huge whirlpool tub, an abundace of space and comfort, and a view of the Bellagio fountains.

A/C extremely noisy when it kicks in. No extras like bathrobe, coffeemaker, mini-fridge, CD player. Bally\u2019s location on center Strip is an advantage. Connection to Paris Hotel and opposite to Bellagio is a bonus. Bally\u2019s relatively small size also turned out to be advantageous \u2013 you don\u2019t walk too far to reach the lobby, the elevator or your room. But location is all there is to recommend about Bally\u2019s. None of its restaurants rate a visit - ordinary yet still expensive. The casino itself is small with less slots than others. Restrooms are rather tired. Wrt service, a late checkout was extended to 1pm - which any hotel in the world would do, so again, very ordinary. FYI, you can check out until 6pm but you pay an extra $45. Shopping tip: Best are Dessert Passage, Forum Shops and Fashion Show Mall. Canal Shoppes ho-hum but worth a visit for the decor. Breakfast tip: If you just need a little substance to tide you over, go to JJ\u2019s Boulangerie in Paris for their excellent breakfast croissant special: egg/ham/cheese croissant with large coffee or juice. $4.95 compared to buffet prices. Buffet tips: Bellagio is most expensive but also more authentic. As a Montrealer, I know French food and I found Paris to be overrated, espec. its overly sweet desserts. Aladdin had nothing really ethnic about its cuisine; ironically, the Chinese section was the weakest. Golden Nugget is inexpensive but then the food was not good. So Bellagio\u2019s buffet wins, but be prepared to wait. VERDICT: If you find yourself staying at Bally\u2019s but going everywhere else to eat and gamble, you might as well stay at another hotel. You would at least get credit for spending $$ in that hotel\u2019s restaurant. Affordable alternatives: Almost recommended Paris but I just read the reviews and they were not scintillating. Flamingo\u2019s is even older than Bally\u2019s. Bellagio is too expensive.

Our stay was very affordable and I would stay there again. We arrived on Wednesday evening and checked into the hotel at the airport. We had called the hotel ahead of time and requested rooms in the North Tower. They upgraded both of our rooms. My parents had a parlor suite with a sitting area and my husband and I had a room with two double beds, instead of a king, and it was smoking, which we had requested non-smoking. The next day we were able to change rooms and we stayed in a room on the same floor as my parents that was non-smoking and had a king bed. Not a big deal, they were very helpful and accomodating when we asked to be moved. The first full day there we purchased half priced tickets to \"V\" at Aladdin. The show was OK, not worth the full price as it was only an hour in length. We ate breakfast at Mandalay Bay, which was very good. We went to happy hour at the Tequila Bar at Bally's - $3.50 Margaritas....yummy :) Our second day we took the \"Celebration Trip\" to the Grand Canyon with Papillion. This helicopter trip was very enjoyable. I would recommend the tour and the tour group to anyone interested in taking this kind of trip. We ate dinner at Belligo. Wonderful buffet! On our third day, we ate at Bally's Big Buffet for dinner, DO NOT WASTE your money! Go somewhere else, the food was OK, but not worth the price. We also saw Jubliee, which I very much enjoyed. Old Vegas, beautiful costumes! On our last day, we ate brunch at Paris the crepes were very good. Would suggest this buffet. Overall we had a nice trip, did not lose big or win big.

She was very friendly and said they are supposed to charge extra but she was not going to charge us. A friend of ours was at another lady and she tried to charge him extra for the North Tower but then when he asked us there we were, she then did not charge him. So I think it just depends on who checks you in. We stayed in room 1157 of North Tower and had a view out onto the strip, we could see the very corner of the Bellagio fountains once in a while, but mostly the Ballys sign out front. The rooms were very clean. I was very nervous after seeing the South Tower room photos. But was pleased when we got into our North Tower room. I will be posting pictures on this site of our room once I get them uploaded to my pc. Didn't get any pictures of the pool. It was OK.

We Were First In Line At Bally's Registration Desk. (Thru-Out Our Stay There Was Almost Always A Que Line of Up To 20 People There). When Bally's Desk Clerk Mentioned They Only Had 1 Room Left In The South Tower With My Requested View of The Bellagio Fountains (A Handicapped One With Shower), I Asked If It Was A Renovated One (& Gave The Desk Clerk A Photo of The Renovated Bally's Labelled \"Standard Room\" From Expedia) - She Said \"No\" They Only Had Only One Renovated Room In The South Tower. I Also Volunteered That We Had Ordered Their \"Connections (Comp) Cards\" & Had Tickets To Their Bally's \"Jubilee\" Show.

The Room Was Big & New, & Big Bathroom Was All Marble, & All of The Highest Quality - Even The Towels & Toilet Paper. A/C Worked Very Well & Maid Service Was So Good That We Left Her A Good Tip On The Last Day. Surprisingly, We Found Everyone We Came In Contact With In LV To Be Extremely Pleasant & Went Out of Their Ways To Help Us - With The Exception of 1-Policeman (But One of His Polite Fellow Police Officer's Chased Us Down Afterwards To Give Us A Personal Helping Hand - While Apologizing For The Other's Abruptness).

I Walked My Feet Off, Was Impressed By The $15 \"Titanic Exhibit\" @ The Tropicana & Free \"Fremont Street Experience\" - But The Downtown Area Where The FE Is Is Very Derelict With Pan-Handlers.

The Bellagio Fountains (Every Hour 12 Noon-8 PM, & Every 15-Minutes 8 PM-12 Midnight )Are Romantic & Exceptionally Majestic & Magical At Night.

On Bally's website they show Standard rooms as pretty North tower rooms, but that is not true. Standard rooms are South tower rooms which they don't show, and North tower rooms are actually Deluxe rooms and cost $20 more per night! If you want a Deluxe room you must upgrade during check-in.

That was the first and only time we had experienced that type of behavior, but her behavior shouldn't reflect on the other staff. Now on to the room. Other reviews seem to sugarcoat South tower rooms, but I won't. South tower rooms are HORRIBLE! The small lobbies and hallways are dark and dank and had a noticeable musty smell. The carpet in our room was stained, dirty, and musty as well. The bed was attached to an outdated headboard and the comforter was threadbare in patches and had crumbs and hair on the underside. The chairs in the room had flat cushions and looked dirty as if someone had jumped on them with shoes on. The dressers were stained and scratched up and some of the drawers wouldn't even close! Instead of being in a cabinet, the T.V. sat on a small, rickety table that looked as if it would fall at any moment. The bathroom was even worse. The counters were outdated and stained and the shower was mildewed and had many cracked, yellowed tiles. My wife and I agreed there was no way we could take off our shoes and get comfortable in that room. We went downstairs and spoke to the hotel manager and told her how unsatisfied we were. We told her we couldn't believe they rented out, or even had rooms like that, in such a nice hotel. The manager was very apologetic and upgraded us to the North tower free of charge. That was very nice of her, but be warned. Standard rooms are not the pretty, Deluxe North tower rooms they show on the website. Standard rooms are horrible South tower rooms, and unless you upgrade for $20 more per night or get a free upgrade that is what you will get. Some people try to make it better by saying you won't be in your room much, but trust me, it doesn't make it better. Not for the price you pay, no matter how little. Also Bally's does not send repeat guests coupons or incentives to visit the hotel again. Even Circus Circus did that when we stayed a few years ago. We will not stay at Bally's again.", "Date": "September 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Plaines, Illinois (Chicago suburb)", "Title": "\u201cWorn out hotel, smoke stink\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3806966", "Content": "8/18-8/22 2005 We used Bally\u2019s check in desk at the airport - fast, convenient.

There is no sufficient ventilation and very bad smell in the room - simply terrible stink. Yes, we both smoke and I understand some smoke odor will be there but this was too much. I complained and they aired the room (opened window by removing safety screw) and sprayed with air freshener. Air-conditioning worked just fine. Room was very quiet. Comfortable beds. So-so housekeeping. We liked eating in hotel restaurants where food and service was fine. Pool is excellent however you have to take a long walk thru the casino and shops.

The rooms were incredibly spacious and it was set far enough away from the Strip that we were able to sleep comfortably without any noise interuption. The view from the room was much to write home about, but considering that we usually were asleep about 10 minutes after we stepped foot in the room it didn't much matter. The staff were nice enough, but unfortunately the help desk was not quite as knowledgable as I'd hoped. When we asked how we might get to Fremont street, they suggested a cab. When in fact there are actual shuttles that take you quite close for a lot cheaper. Of course we found that little important tidbit of info on our own on the last day of the trip. The pool was nice, a bit small, but we able to locate a lounge chair and were given free towels; something I hadn't expected since the hotel was quite cheap. The only thing that I can absolutely complain of was the food. The diner that we went to one late night had food that was disgusting, I mean how can you mess up a cheeseburger. After that experience, we didn't even attempt the buffet. Now if you want a superior buffet with a staggering array of choices and tasty fresh food in an adorable atmosphere, the Paris buffet is where you want to go. It beat out the Bellagio's buffet just for the shear volume of choice. And the best part about it was that Paris is connected to Bally's so all we had to do was role out of bed and walk about the equivalent of two blocks to the buffet. A little trick: make sure you get in by 11:00AM. Lunch starts at 11:30AM so by the time you've finished breakfast, the lunch will have been laid out and you will have paid breakfast prices for both breakfast AND lunch. Trust me it is worth it!!.

As usual, was very pleased with the room, even if it overlooked all the pipes and connections on the roof below. And where they find those hard-as-brick mattresses I don't know. But, otherwise the room was clean and comfortable. Made sure I had a non-connecting room to avoid noise from the next room. Still used earplugs every night just in case of late night drunks making noise in the hallways. You should always have ear plugs (the wax ones are the best), with you on a trip to Vegas. The casino seems to be getting smokier and smokier. Since they have taken away some slot machines and replaced them with more table games, the table games now go wall to wall in the middle of the casino floor. This creates a constant wave of cigarette smoke, especially through the south side of the casino. You can't spend much time at the machines there without leaving with your hair, clothes, even socks reeking of cigarette smoke. Restaurants not so good. Sidewalk cafe over priced and poor quality. Another smoking story here........Was in line late at night, about 1AM with about 12 other people. The hostess as usual asks everyone if they wanted smoking or non-smoking. Everyone wanted non-smoking and we waited and waited. I could see a whole area with no one seated there so I asked the hostess why we couldn't be seated there. She replied \"oh, 'that's the smoking area.\" Couldn't they have opened a few tables in the end of that area for the non-smokers? Maybe they were expecting a sudden rush of about 100 smokers? I think the best deal for food at Bally's is the room service, which is always quick and efficient and good, and no more expensive than eating at the Sidewalk Cafe. The Big Buffet hasn't improved, but at least they keep breakfast items out now along with lunch items. You might enjoy the buffet if you love seafood, they serve so much of it. Also had a complaint about Johnny's deli in the mall area. Lines were long and I ordered the Trifecta, which was supposed to be a corned beef, turkey, swiss cheese, etc. I ordered it on rye toast and waited about 10 minutes for a burnt rye toast sandwich (I thought I could scrape off the burnt part,) but then I opened the sandwich and see the corned beef which was 90% fat, so I picked out all that, then noticed the turkey breast also had big globs of fat in it. There was a thin slice of tomato and thick slice of swiss cheese. Then there was a big glob of runny cole slaw right on the sandwich with a third slice of burnt rye toast. A scrawny wedge of dill pickle accompanied the mess. The line was too long so I didn't bother to complain, just left the sandwich and got out of there. Will mention the snack bar at the south end of the casino, near the tower elevators. Nothing to complain about here, excellent sandwiches and snacks at very reasonable prices. I always get their chicken salad (big chunks of all white chicken), and they are always glad to serve the chicken salad on a plate with whatever you want, lettuce, tomato, onion, etc. and give you a roll or bagel on the side. All this for an unbelievable low price of $4.95. They also have a nice variety of pastries, ready to eat salads, chips, and beverages. Wherever you eat in Bally's, be sure to show your Connection Card for an automatic discount.

We were greeted at the door by a doorman who carefully took our baggage as we were quickly checked in. The desk-check-in was fast, being at 5:30pm., so I was impressed with that..and the desk clerk confirmed our room as a \"King, no smoking,\" which was not what we had requested (thru Orbitz)..and as I stated I needed a handicapped accessiable room with two queen beds, they remade room keys and sent us to the north tower. We were surprised the vastness of this room...they had given us a large suite, complete with full kitchen, dining room, living and 2 seperate bedrooms.! Called to the front desk to make sure I wasn't being charged for this before unpacking...the reply--\"no charge\" we just want to make sure you are comfortable at Bally's. Hotel staff, housekeeping went beyond to answer questions and clean well daily, and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains!! Gaming was fair and fun at Bally's with an upbeat/soulful sound between 8pm - 2 am at club Indgo, just off the casino floor, and with the ease in access to the other side of the strip via overstreet walkway at the Bally's property as well as the Monorail which was quite useful all week (as the temperatures were well into the 120's daily), we had a great time at Bally's. We usually visit las vegas twice yearly if not more, and usually stay at what I now call the \"cookie cutter\" hotel's\" (such small and predictable room/floor plan)... Mirage, TI, Bellagio, MGM, but if you want more space for less money and easy access to the strip and monorail stops..Ballys Las Vegas puts you in the middle of all of the best. We did use the pool, to which you need to grab a chair early in the morning or late in the afternoon, and it was clean and refreshing..but did not have the upgrades and \"beaches\" like Mandalay Bay or Mirage, but all we wanted to do was swim and cool off, so no big thing for us. The Tequila Bar had very cool and stiff drinks (a good thing) with bartenders and waiters on the ball, as well the 24 hr eatery next door to it has good food at a reasonable price. The kitchen buffet was only visited once by us, (I just am not a buffet type person..and expensive unless you can really justify eating all that food--good selection there) and since Bally's connects with the \"streets\" to Paris, it gave us opportunity to see more/have more options for food and shopping to use our comps.. infact, the day (night) of departure, we asked for later checkout..could give us until 3pm with no charge but since we were leaving at midnight, wanted to keep the room until later and freshen up before leaving, they only charged us $36.00...and worked with \"the connection comp card\" ... so that there were NO charges at all on my credit card that I left on file.

I was booked to be in the North Tower, but changed to the south tower because they had rooms immediately available. (I was also concerned that I might hear the emergency trucks all night if my room faced the side street in the North tower, from reading other reviews.) I ended up in the South tower, 9th floor. The odd numbered rooms overlook the Paris Hotel and the Eiffel tower! It was far from the elevator, which translated into peace and quiet. Didn't hear an emergency truck. I could hear the Bellagio fountains, and get a glimpse of them. What an awesome site, worth getting out of the room to go see. The room size was nice! The room furnishings were clean and adequate, eventhough they do not look like the pictures of the renovated rooms (located in the North Tower) on the website. I'm allergic to cigarette smoke, so I took a small air purifier, but really didn't need it. In fact, the casino area was only smoky in the evenings, but tolerable the rest of the time. I do recommend signing up for the Connections card. Dining in any of the Bally's restaurants or buffet receives a discount, if you show your card. I enjoyed the buffet for breakfast each day. What a selection. If you're on a reduced carb diet, you can find plenty of choices and the waitresses were friendly. The bright buffet dining room was nice because of the huge windows that overlook the Bally's marquee, Caesar's, the mountains, and the Barbary Coast. The discount I mentioned earlier is also available at other Caesar's properties, like Paris. Speaking of Paris, it was so nice to be able to walk from Bally's to Paris without out having to go outdoors, plus there's all the shops and restaurants along the way.

However because we were traveling to meet friends and family for our anniversary we thought it might be fun and easier to stay on the strip. We also wanted to see a \"traditional\" Las Vegas show and had heard good things about Jubilee. When considering staying in your hotel, we first checked on line, however because we were traveling to Las Vegas to celebrate our 20th anniversary we phoned to ask a few questions to make sure we knew what we were getting. The reservations clerk was very helpful and informative. She explained that the Summer Sizzlin package were for rooms in the old tower which had not been upgraded and suggested that we spend an addition $20 a night to upgrade to a new room, on a higher floor with views since it was such a special occasion. Because of her recommendation we did book the more expensive room. She thanked us for choosing Bally's and said that we would be glad we made the choice to stay and upgrade. Upon check in we had already been assigned a room on the 16th floor. We asked if there were any upgrades available since it was a special occasion and the clerk rudely informed us that the anniversary was noted and everything had already been taken care of. So we were excited to get upstairs and see our room. The room was not anything like we anticipated. First the carpet was 3 different colors from some kind of cleaning or lack of cleaning, which made us feel the room was unsanitary, second the view was the top of a lower building and the other tower of the hotel. The sofa was not in front of the windows as your web page shows, but rather back against an interior wall, that it mattered as there was no view any way. Needless to say we were not satisfied so called the front desk. The desk informed us that the room was considered an upgraded room and that there was nothing else they could do. We explained in detail what our concerns were about the room and again were informed that the room was the best the hotel could offer. We asked if that was the only vacant room in the hotel and the desk informed us that they had one other room we could look at but that it was on a lower floor. We looked at the room and felt that it appeared to at least be clean and although it had no sofa, we at least could see a couple of the other hotels from the window. So we opted to change our room. When we inquired about a lesser rate since the room was on a much lower floor we were rudely informed that the rate was the same for any room in that tower because they had been remodeled. Quite a different story then what we got from the reservationist. The next morning we went to meet friends who were picking us up and witnessed one of your employees treating people waiting for cabs so rudely I would have come right back to the hotel and complained. He actually told a young mother to get in the --- car as he was shoving her things into the taxi van. We had dinner at the buffet and with the exception of the man bringing us our drinks everyone was rude. We had lunch in the 24 hour coffee shop and again your employees were rude. In a town that was created on and boasts of service, your hotel falls short. It is apparent that your employees are not happy in your hotel either. We checked out via the TV and today our record came showing a charge for the safe rental, which we never used. And while it is only a $3 charge, the safe says UPON USE not an automatic daily charge. Obviously your hotel has some severe problems in communicating to the consumer what you offer and what you charge. We feel that hotel had a bait and switch attitude and that the consumer should be aware of your tactics. We are thankful that we have been married 20 years and actually survived the stress your hotel put us through when we should have been celebrating such a wonderful occasion.

Lets start with the positive. 1- It is in a GREAT location, right smack dab in the middle of everything. 2- It is reasonably priced as compared to neighboring properties. 3- Marvelous view of the Strip, the nightly water ballet from the Bellagio was just outside my window. 4- Room service/maintanance was friendly and prompt. (Note that I used the word \"maintanance\"). 5- Early Check-in is available at the airport (Recommended because you get your room key and can bypass the massive lines at the hotel lobby.) Then, unfortunately, there is the negative. 1- While room rates are reasonable, eating at ANY of the hotels eateries and lounges negates any possible room savings. If you are here on any kind of a budget... GOOD LUCK. More reasonably priced meals are available outside the hotel. Keep in mind that Bally's is very big and it will take you a few minutes to get outside to any neighboring venues. 2- I had on-going issues with room service and maintance. Room service was always forgetting to leave toilet paper or not cleaning properly. Calling housekeeping always set things straight quickly, but you shouldn't have to call them to start with. When I first checked in, the sliding doors to the closet were off the hinges. Maintance fixed it quickly, but why didn't housekeeping report this problem when they were cleaning the room instead of making the customer do it? 3- Casino's are known for giving free drinks to guests who are gambling. The same is true here. Unfortunately, even high rollers have problems getting any service at Bally's. The waitress staff is stretched so thin that getting waited on more than once every hour is a major accomplishment. During one period of time, I sat in the KENO parlor for two hours and didn't even see a waitress... I thought this might be a one time thing, but I was at Bally's four days and the unavailability of a waitress was an ongoing hassle. Good tipper or no, good luck in getting served. 4- Since you will have a very hard time getting waited on in the casino, you will probably want to get some refreshments and snacks at nearby convience stores. BEWARE... some of the convience stores on Las Vegas Blvd will charge you $15.99 for a 12 pack of beer and $4.00 for a 2 litre soft drink. The cost in the hotel isn't any better. A 20 oz soft drink in the hotel is $2.00+tax. Shop around... 5- Be very careful if you venture outside after dark. I didn't notice any hotel security anywhere outside the hotel. You cannot walk anywhere without having someone aggressively force printed advertisements for prostitutes at you. (According to local sources, this is legally allowed under 1st amendment rights) If you refuse to take the offered porn card, they will pop the card with their finger or hand at you (symbolically flipping you the bird?). Also from what I could see, the local police are basically nonexistant on the strip. Some mounted or foot patrol police would be greatly appreciated to help keep the riff-raff from bothering the visitors. During my entire 4 day visit, I didn't see a single police officer on the strip after dark. Advice: don't go outside alone. Synopsis: Vegas is still a fun place to visit. Visit with your hand tightly on your billfold and Vegas can still be a relatively inexpensive vacation. BUT beware of the price gouging as it is virtually everywhere in Vegas. If the casino doesn't get you, the neighboring stores will. Shop around and do a bit of walking and you will find more reasonably priced offerings than those found just around the corner.", "Date": "June 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cBally's - solid value\u201d", "Author": "SoCalBeachBum", "ReviewID": "UR3613625", "Content": "Just returned from a weekend at Bally's (Thur June 23 \u2013 Sun June 26).

Everyone felt Bally's offered a solid value for the dollar, especially when combined with their $35 per day room add-on for access to spa, continental breakfast, and early evening happy-hour snacks (pasta, rice and beef, cheese, fruit, and small fee for beer, wine and well drinks). Would have gladly foregone the add-on, however, and paid an additional $100 total per head to have stayed in Caesars, Mandalay, Venetian. Unwilling to pay the $200+ total per head those places wanted for that weekend. Check-in was fast, easy, friendly and very accommodating to our needs and requests. I let the person know how much it was appreciated in the usual and customary way and that person was polite and thankful in their response. We requested rooms on the smoking floor to be near each other although only one of us smokes cigars.

The coffee shop down by the front desk has excellent muffins, and the deli kind of back in the corner by the escalators has really good sandwiches. There's a live band that plays at night in Indigo, which you can hear from the casino. I didn't think the casino was especially smoky, but I was smoking, so maybe I'm not the best judge. Won $400 on the cute slot machines with the ducks that light up and quack (I'm such girl). I think my husband broke even on the craps tables.

The room smelled of smoke, the bed looked like someone had been lying on it, there were empty beer bottles in the room, and in the toilet was some cigarettes as well as some other inappropriate things, plus it was right next to the elavator and you could hear the elavator all night long. Immediately called the front desk and explained the situation. There was not another non-smoking room available until the next day, so I had to request that they send up housekeeping to re-clean a room that should have been clean in the first place. We went to the casino for a few hours and then back to the room, and it had been cleaned.

Because of language limitations and cultural orientation, we needed to find adjacent rooms. In trying to make this type of reservation at Bally's we learned that rooms aren't assigned until check in and there were no guarentees that our needs could be accomodated. Therefore we opted for a \"three room delux suite\"; the expense was considerably more than we had expected, but the circumstances didn't leave us many options. The accomodations were very very adequate. The suite, was composed of three adjacent rooms with internal doors. All of the rooms were very spacious, and the three rooms could have accomodated many more than the 5 in our party. One of the rooms had a tiled bath area with sunken tub, two vanity sinks, shower, toilet and bidet. The other room had two large beds and the third \"sitting room had a dining table, a comfortable fold down bed, refrigeratior. Each room had shower, tub and private toilet. The amount of space was almost humorous and the furnishings were comfortable and much more than adequate. We had a very nice stay and enjoyed ourselves very much! The down side: There is something just a bit seedy about the hotel. It could use a total refubishing. Upon our arrival there was obvious housekeeping flaws, e.g. finger prints and coffee stains on the doors and doorways and one of the rooms wasn't made up at all. A call to housekeeping took care of this. Furniture and rugs a bit worn and dirty and age shows on most of the accomodations. The exterior entrance is glitzy but chipping and rusting and the walking escalators kept breaking down. We were in the North Tower which looks out on a side street and the view was much less than the absolute spectacle of looking over at Bellagio, or Caesar's Palace or Paris.

I also commented to my companions that there seemed to be much less politeness and effort put forth by mainfloor staff.

When we checked-in they did not have the room type we had reserved and were not prepared to upgrade us. We settled for a room with two Queen beds. It was 11pm when we checked-in and went to our room. Upon opening the door I was shocked. The room was like you were staying at some 20 year old Super 8 motel. Very run down, old and nothing special. The bathroom shower was also very tired and had mold. Also, the air conditioning system was very loud as it turned on and off...rattling each time. We found the hotel staff not very helpful and somewhat clued out. The casio did not appear to have a good ventilation system as it was always smokey...too smokey for us. The pool is nice but get there early to get a chair as they go quickly. We spent most of our time at the Paris restaurants and Casino when we weren't out experiencing the strip. For the price we paid I would have expected much much better accomodations. As far as we are concerned, Bally's has the location but the Paris is the quality hotel. Bally's is charging way too much for what you get.", "Date": "May 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kailua, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "jipc", "ReviewID": "UR3483329", "Content": "I stayed at Ballys last week for a conference.

I had originally planned on staying at Paris Las Vegas, one of my favorite Las Vegas hotels, but a couple of weeks before the trip, Bally's sent me an offer for a room rate of $59.00 per night for the first three (3) nights, and I couldn't pass that up. The hallways were a bit dark and gloomy at Bally's but the room was nicely decorated and very well appointed. I was in the South Tower and had an excellent view of Flamingo Road with the Rio to the left down the road. The room was larger than what I had had at Paris. As other reviewers have noted, the location of Bally's cannot be beat with the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Flamingo, and all the rest just across the street, and the fact that Bally's is connected to its sister property Paris is a big plus in my book. Since I thought that Bally's casino was a bit small and dull, I spent my time (and money) in the casino at Paris. That's the beauty of it: Sleep in the large rooms at Bally's and spend your money at Paris, Caesars Palace, or Flamingo; you get comp dollars from all those sister properties that you can apply to your bill at Bally's at check-out. The pool at Bally's is okay, nothing special. Those who are looking for an attractive pool scene will do better at the Flamingo (I've never stayed at Flamingo but I have seen its gorgeous pool) or Hard Rock on Paradise Road. I don't have any thing negative to say about Bally's. It's a functional hotel that is somewhere between moderate and upscale in my opinion. I like to gamble at all of the Caesars Palace-affiliated properties: Caesars Palace, Paris, Flamingo, Bally's, and O'Shea's. The Caesars Group has always been very generous with its offers and comp dollars with me.

After reading other people's reviews on this website we were a bit apprehensive about what would greet us. We shouldn't have worried as it's a fantastic Hotel. Its location is extremely central, an ideal base. We arrived at the hotel and checked in about 9pm on the Thursday night. There was not queue at all at check in and we were dealt with quickly and efficiently. When we booked our room through the travel agents we asked for a few things (North Tower, not a high floor, twin beds etc.) these were all honoured at check in. The room although not one of the newly renovated ones (these are in the South Tower) was extremely nice and well decorated in hues of beige with an accent colour of red. The 2 queen size beds we\u2019re very comfy, and in addition to these there was also a huge easy chair, and a marble topped desk, a standard lamp, a large cupboard in which the widescreen TV was housed, and a full sized dressing table and chair. You would think having all this in one room would make it very cramped. Well you would be wrong!! These rooms are massive, and Bally's proudly boast that they have the biggest rooms on the Strip, and I can quite believe it. Having an iron and ironing board in the room as standard is a great touch, as most of my clothes were in need of a good pressing after making the 13 hour trip from Scotland. The maid service was also excellent. We had fresh towels to replace our used ones every day, the beds were always made and the bathroom was also cleaned on a daily basis. We made use of the in-room safe, which is highly recommend unless you want to take your valuables out with you everyday.

It is not necessarily the newest and most glamourous of all the big and wonderful hotel complexes in LV, but it is the one of more enduring quality, with a capital Q. places to spend a vacation. The rooms are more than generous in size, are extremely well kept with whatever amenities one may require, and very comfortable. The facilities include all one would expect in an upper class Las Vegas hotel, such as swimming pools, one for just hanging out in and one for those who really are there to swim, the usual shopping area for people who need to shop to live, numbers of places to breakfast, lunch, snack, dine or whatever you might wish. Not to forget the half-price margarita bar between 4 and 6 pm. Room prices will vary, based on days of the week and the kind of deal one can find, but for our money, it has been the best place so far. Not by much I might add, but so far the best. The casino is what one would expect in an upper class hotel, roomy and well laid out, the bar area is jumping with entertainment that keeps the patrons quite happy, and, to top it all off, the hotel is connected by means of a very short common area to the Paris Las Vegas Hotel, which by itself increases the variety of the restaurants, bars, and entertainment available in one quantum leap two or three-fold. Maybe more. The Las Vegas monorail stops at the rear of the property, and with that one has access to parts of the Las Vegas strip previously only reached by cab, other public transportation or long walks on Las Vegas Blvd. Not a bad thing in itself, but distances in LV can be deceiving when you're on foot. In terms of location, it is right in the centre of the \"happening\" strip and it is connected by means of overhead walkways to the other hotels at the Las Vegas Blvd. and Flamingo Drive corner. If one never leaves that corner for a week, well maybe with a couple of side trips up and down the \"strip\" one will just not run out of things to do.

When booking our hotel, and knowing nothing about Vegas or the other hotels, we went with Bally's because of location and price... Firstly, like many others, I could not agree on its location. Right smack dab in the middle of the strip, across from Bellagio, close to Caesar's Palace and adjoining with Paris Hotel. Because we were not enjoying Bally's itself so much, we loved that we could get to all the above mentioned (amazing!) hotels so easily. As for Bally's itself, here are some more positives: -- friendly staff ** special mention to Alice in the Lost and Found Dept. who is sending my bathing suit back home as I forgot it in the room upon check-out!! She was so incredibly nice and helpful. -- check-in and check- out were quick and easy -- outdoor pool area nice and clean, though on a hot day, recommend getting a lounge chair by 10:00am at the latest. The poolside snack bar made great food and was reasonably priced. One day it was unlimited pop refills which was great! -- room was clean -- monorail was so convenient -- after reading some of the reviews before we arrived, I was worried it wouldn't be running. The monorail was running all 7 days we were there. And, as it turned out, we used it quite a bit!! The negatives: -- though the room itself was clean, that is about all it was. We kept telling ourselves that we weren't in Vegas for the room, but honestly, it was very run down and needed some serious updating. It sounds like the tower we were staying in must be the older one. Yes, we did have a view of the strip (mostly the Eiffel Tower) but we would have preferred the updated room. -- room service cost killed us one night -- $30 for chicken wings and chicken tenders!!!! Completely ridiculous. -- not impressed with the Big Kitchen (breakfast) Buffet in Bally's. Very small selection compared to the breakfast buffets in the Flamingo and Paris Hotel. We completely loved the service at the Paris buffet and the buffet in Flamingo is HUGE and only $11.99/person!! Seriously, don't waste your time at Bally's -- these other two were far better. -- DO NOT EAT AT BALLY'S STEAKHOUSE!! Please -- there are so many better options out there and they will probably cost you less. First of all, the service was absolutely horrific. We were seated practically in the back of the restaurant after making a reservation the day prior. We just found the demeanor of our waiter to be inappropriate. After selecting my main course, I asked what the side dish was and he looked at me strangely and said 'The meat just comes with the sauce.\" Rather than showing me where the side selections were in the menu, I fumbled through and quickly decided on the asparagus, added nearly $10 onto my already $30 entree. I honestly could not believe it. In fairness, the meat was delicious, but our waiter would not know that as he did not come back to check on us until our plates and glasses were empty. We spent $130 on a very disappointing meal. Seriously, you can eat at much more elegant places such as Chinois at Caesar's or Emeril's in MGM Grande and spend less money as these establishments include a side dish with their entree, and have impeccable service. We called after our meal to let the manager know. We made it clear we were not looking for a comp in any way, but that he needed to know that the service was severely lacking, at least in our section of the restaurant!! Oh -- if you guys make it down to the Stratosphere, you MUST eat at Fellini's, in the corner of the casino! Oh my goodness, the service was top notch and the Italian food was AMAZING!! My husband said the cheesecake was the best he had ever had. It is well worth the trip. -- We found the casino at Bally's to be relatively uneventful and small compared to others. We spent most of our time at the Paris casino as it was far less smokey, or we went across the street to Caesar's. -- We also found there was nothing to 'do' at Bally's, beyond the couple of restaurants and casino. During our stay, we had some days where the weather was less than favourable. We never stayed at Bally's. In fact, we spent most of our time at Caesar's. Though I cannot speak of the the room at Caesar's, they have tons of restaurants and the shopping is fantastic. We often said that if we had stayed there, we wouldn't have to leave the actual hotel if we didn't want to. It literally had everything. The shops in Bally's never had a customer in them that I could see and the selection of shops was poor. Bally's was very uneventful to us. Now I feel like I could rant about all the things we loved about Caesar's Palace -- but I won't. This is a review for Bally's hotel and all wrapped up, we would choose another hotel next time we visit Vegas. Was our stay terrible? No -- but it could have been better in so many ways.

Our trip was spur-of-the-moment and we chose Bally's simply because it is my father's favorite Vegas hotel. We booked a charter vacation and arrived at Bally's in the morning to a long line to check in. (I understand there is an alternate check-in now at McCarran). I know many people complain about waiting in long lines to check in at many of the hotels. I just took it in stride. My excitement just to be in Vegas overwhelmed any negative thoughts I may have felt otherwise. Anyway, all along the counter there were signs indicating to ask about the whirlpool rooms (they are called Grand Suites now). I had sprained my ankle right before we left, so I felt a whirlpool tub would be good for me. When we asked, we were informed they were only $50 more per night. Sure! We'll take one! So up to the room we go. (I don't remember that the elevators were very far away. Locations of everything seemed very conveniently placed throughout.) Now, I don't know if you are like me, but I'm always excited about opening the door to a hotel room for the first time. I like staying in nicer hotels and the atmosphere and amenities of a room are important to me. Let me tell you....when we opened that door and saw that room, I was amazed at how beautiful it was. Huge sunken whirlpool, huge room, sofa, two separate vanity AREAS (not sinks---AREAS). A separate shower room, separate room for the toilet, two large clothes closets, TONS of marble. WOW. Nothing compared to what came after that though! We dropped off our bags in the room and headed down to gamble. When we arrived back at our room about 10:30 pm (which is 2:30 am on our body clock) we were exhausted. But we had a message from the front desk informing us that there was a \"problem with our room\" and to please bring our bags down to the front desk and they will assign us a different room. I was a bit perturbed at that point. I should have called the front desk and told them to send someone up to give us a new key and take our bags to the new room. But instead we just went down and got our new room key directly from the front desk. So up we go again, anxious to just get into bed and get some sleep, but not expecting the excitement that was awaiting us. We opened the door on the very top floor figuring the same type of room. The adjectives have not been invented to explain the amazement we felt when entering that room!!! This room had two floors, a winding staircase to a mezzanine overlooking the living room, a large wet bar, dining room/living room combination, two bathrooms, 30 ft floor to ceiling windows! The bedroom was upstairs and was exactly like the room we had just come from. I found out recently that this is a room that is not available to the general public (I asked about it when I wanted to make our most recent reservations). I figure that until we become High Rollers we will never experience a room like that again! Now that we are planning another trip this July (geez is it hot then---hard to even breath outside), I cannot justify staying anywhere else no matter how hard I try. I\u2019d like to try someplace different, and I have been in a constant quandary for 3 weeks as to where we should stay--Mandalay Bay, Mirage, Bellagio, Monte Carlo, Paris, Bally's, the Wynn. However, I cannot even force myself to stay anywhere but Bally's. Bally's just has too much going for it\u2014the comfortably large whirlpool rooms, the tram station I\u2019ve read about right within Bally\u2019s (believe me\u2014I don't prefer going outside in that heat!), the easy interior access to Paris (my favorite place to gamble because of unique outdoor atmosphere), easy access to everything within the hotel. Personally, I believe I prefer a really nice room in a three-star or four-star hotel over a standard room in a five-star hotel for the same money.

Because of its central position and larger than average rooms. Check-in was quick and easy, as we arrived late evening due to delayed flights form the UK. The room WAS very spacious, and clean, with comfortable beds - great to sink into after a very long journey! The safe in the room did not work, and on calling reception, we waited only a few minutes for someone to fix it, and he was very polite and friendly.

The bath had easy access for anyone with restricted mobility, as the sides were not too high. The towels were white and fluffy - and lots of them. The shower curtain was heavy quality. I left a small tip for the maids every day, and when I requested some shower gel, got loads of bottles of everything, including some of Bally's facial and bath soap - lovely quality French soaps.

At check in the receptionist couldnt even muster a hello, just demanded my license and credit card. When I realized she was assigning a room, I spoke up to make sure we would get connecting rooms, only to be told that was not possible, even though I had requested it when I originally booked. Didn't even bother asking for an upgrade or the north tower with a strip view. She was so unfriendly, I just wanted to finish the transaction. Either the hotel or my floor was out of shampoo, went four days with tons of conditioner and no shampoo. When we finally got shampoo, the maid took all the conditioner. I had started out with a nice tip, but that dwindled as the shampoo situation got worse. On the plus side, the rooms are clean and big. A relative ordered a fruit basket from Ballys which was delivered to my parents room. Some of the fruit was over-ripe and the peanuts were so stale as to not be edible. On our last full day there, I took our connection cards to the desk to have our slot comps applied to the room. After waiting about 45 mins. while the rep. talked to someone on the phone, he advised me that since we didn't booked thru Ballys we could only use the comps for room service and a movie my Dad had ordered by mistake. I explained to him that we booked directlly through the Ballys website, but he said sorry, no go. Next morning, waiting to leave, I went back to the connection card desk and asked if there was anything I could use all those comp points for. The clerk said I could apply them to the hotel room charge! Why they put us through all that crap the day before is beyond me. When I got home, I sent a complaint via the internet and got a notice that someone would contact me within 24 hours. Never heard from them. I wouldn't even call this a three star hotel. We dumped thousands of dollars at this place but they will never get another dime from us.

Overall we had a great experience at this property. It's central location and price (compared to it's neighbors: Paris, Caesar's Bellagio) can't be beat. I would definitely consider staying at Bally's again. We used airport check-in while we were waiting for our luggage. It took about 2 minutes. They confirmed our reservation, issued us a key and explained where our room was located. I am so glad we did this. When we got to the hotel the check in line was really long so this saved a lot of time! Our room was a mini-suite: Room 7301 in the South Tower. This was a great room for us. Lots of extra space (which was good because we had people in and out of there all week). It had 2 sinks/vanities and a sunken tub in the middle. I was a little disappointed that it wasn't a jacuzzi tub. When I booked the room I had just assumed that it would be because I didn't know why they would put a regular sunken tub in the middle of a hotel room. Oh well. It was still a great room! Two of our friends wound up getting to Las Vegas a day early and didn't have a reservation anywhere so they stayed in our room. Bally's gave us an extra bed and it stayed in our room the entire weekend free of charge. They never added any charges to our bill. We were really surprised by this. From our room we had a view of the Eiffel tower and the Bellagio Fountains. This was great, especially at night. The one and only SLIGHT downside to this is that at night you can hear the fountains booming. Not a big deal though...it didn't keep me up at night. The Spa at Bally's - I woke up the morning of my wedding *SO*& worn out. I called the spa to see if they could fit me in for a massage and they could! Let me tell you, this was the best thing I did the entire trip! You walk in and they hand you a warm robe and towel and slippers show you to your locker. Then they take you on a tour. There are 2 big Jacuzzi's, a sauna, a quiet room where you can sleep, a gym, rain showers, sitting areas, hair styling areas. This would be a great place to go with a group of friends. I wish I would have known about it sooner. You can use the facilities when you book a treatment. Or you can just pay like $20 to use them. And the best part is you can come and go as you please all day. Oh...and my massage was great.

Having lost my card and Ballys and several casinos I can vouch for this, and if for some reason his account was erased he should have complained. Your comp dollars are stored in an account on a computer...the card simply tells the machine which account to access....that stupid little card does not contain all over your account information. Again, this is customer error...not Bally's fault. Finally this gentleman flasely advises people to make sure they use all of their comp dollars before they check out of the hotel, because as soon as you do, they erase your account. Again, this is not true. If this gentleman had read the little brochure they give you when you get the card he would have known this. He says that his relative only had a couple dollars left and wanted to use them for breakfast. Well, as the rules of the card clearly state, you can only take out a minimum of $10. So if you have less than that...you can't use them. Be wary of what other customers say...people screw things up. In my opinion Ballys is the best value on the strip. GREAT comps, nice rooms, and a nice casino.

This write up is a long one but hopefully will help others out. We arrived on 23rd December and was greeted by a very lovely check-in clerk, Bridget who was tip top when it came to service and, noticing we were there for such a long time, gave us upgraded, inter-connected rooms in the North Tower - perfect for me and my parents. So fabulous was the service that I posted a note up on this forum that very night! We had stayed at Flamingo about 18 months previously so had already signed up for comp cards, however, we needed to get copies made and also we had subsequently lost our previously generated comp points which was a bit disappointing. Here are some overall observations, having stayed for a long time: 1) Over Christmas and New Years Eve peaks, the service really deteriorated - the staff simply couldn't cope - you were lucky to see a cocktail waitress when using slots in the evening. 2) The service in the 24 hour Sidewalk Cafe was absolutely abominable. My mother was served soup which was stone cold, when we asked for it to be heated up, the waiter made us feel like we were really putting him out! He threw the warmed up dish back at her on his return! We weren't alone with experiencing his attitude. The food was edible, but on a couple of the dishes the sauces weren't cooked out properly so lacked real flavour. 3) The Sterling Brunch is worth a visit - particularly if you like champagne and seafood - although it is expensive if you don't drink champagne or like lobster! I would also insist on seating in the Steak House area as we were pushed out into Al Dente next door meaning we had a route march back and forth to the buffet - OK if you want to walk off the course but not ideal for my partially disabled father! 4) There was some really aggressive behaviour being allowed to fester on some of the tables over the Christmas and NYE peak. My drink got knocked over twice in the space of half an hour on the roulette table - right over all my chips! A fellow gambler mentioned she also had her drink spilled by the same character! It seemed unfair that gamblers hovering over three or four tables should be allowed to brashly lean straight over seated gamblers aside without any intervention from security, even after you complain about the behaviour. I cashed in and walked - completely fed up with the whole thing. 5) Ballys as a whole needs to sharpen its act - it provides very little to its guests in the way of quality - the rooms are a good size, but tatty round the edges. I would like to see the payout rate for Ballys as I didn't witness anyone winning large amounts on the slots - unlike in other casinos. 6) The comp machines were very temperamental - meaning you had three or four attempts before being able to cash in on your hard-earned discounts. 7) My recommendation for using the in-room Internet service is DON'T! Use the terminals in the business centre instead. It is temperamental and I discovered that even though I had paid \u00a39.99 for 24 hours access, I was then subsequently charged that same day for additional access! It was cleared up on checkout without question but would have been missed had I not already picked it up by viewing my bill on the TV screen beforehand. 8) The cleaning and in-room supplies were poorer on the days when the hotel was obviously more busy. The threshold between the two rooms was thick with dust when we first arrived and even though we left the door open - was never cleaned while we were there! Replacement of the correct number of towels, toiletries, etc was haphazard too on busy days, although the overall cleanliness was OK. 9) The service at Sully's bar was also really poor and the bar really lacked atmosphere. We found one decent bartender there, but otherwise, it seemed like there were enough tenders, but each had one side of the island bar to deal with, and the other tenders would ignore waiting customers if that wasn't their side of the bar! I am guessing it is because of the method used for tipping, but it resulted in us walking away from the bar twice - that's over $25 of drinks lost! 10) Al dente was a decent restaurant with attentive service, although the decor was very dated and for what is probably tipped to be the second best restaurant in Ballys, deserves better. 11) There is a premium charged on drinks in the Indigo bar in the evening, as well as insistence you purchase two drinks minimum if you are watching the entertainment (which is very good quality and very popular). We didn't come across any similar practices elsewhere, although no doubt this exists. 12) The shopping mall downstairs is disappointing. OK - its not meant as competition for Caesars Forum, but it is so very dated, there are quite a few empty shops and it generally lacks character and decent lighting. 13) One reason to visit the mall is to use the link to the Monorail which is fabulous and having four days of free rides over Christmas was excellent too! 14) I think being charged for a room safe is appalling practice - it was also the case at Flamingo and really is the height of meanness for any hotel to practice in my opinion. 15) Make sure you cash in your comp points before checking out. My mother had just a few dollars worth left and planned to use them for her breakfast on the last day, but once we had checked out - her card was immediately disabled - poor show really. 16) I had to rely almost entirely on web-based information and the Caesars web site for Ballys is pretty poor and out of date - no mention of car rental facilities being in the hotel (which I had to prebook as it was a rush time), Sterling brunch, parking facilities, etc. 17) The comp card will also provide you with discounts in many of the shops too, as well as breakfast buffet, so it is worth using if only for that. Following on from other comments from reviewers, it is best to get your comp information updated at the desk - we found our address information was missing and the comp machine just registered \"invalid information\" when we tried to claim back points. Also, request two cards when you register, keep one in your room safe and if you lose it, you won't lose points. My father lost his card and previously generated points too. Having said all this, Ballys is in a great central position, ample free self parking, a link to Paris which is a bonus, a nice steakhouse and a great Sterling brunch. On the downside, the service was inconsistent in quality, there was an air of meanness in the facilities for guests and many of the public areas and elements of the rooms are tired, tatty and dated in decor. So all in all, a pretty mixed time. Overall I think its fair to say we were disappointed with the hotel and won't stay there again, Ballys is relying almost wholly now on its central position and is not offering the value it used to offer (I stayed there about three years ago and the quality was definitely better). It didn't ruin our holiday by any means - we had a ball anyway, but it did leave a little bitter taste in the mouth at times.

Years ago we had a terrible experience there. So I called ahead this time around to make sure they would give us a good room for no extra charge --it was our 20th anniversary. Said they would for us and friends. Tried to also secure champagne or something due to what we had experienced previously, and they hemmed and hawed over that. Finally one said they would see what they could do. (More on that later.) Friends called and we called day or two before check-in and they did give us the free up-grade and said it would not change... though it seemed one of the two people I spoke with was hesitant to do so due to us being on a charter. (MORE ON CHARTER later.) Check-in was great! We got in around 9:30a--didn't even go through airport check-in. Got on the shuttle and got going. There was no line for check-in and actually the person checking us in was great. She gave us our room keys and comp cards. Asked about the champagne, kinda said happy anniversary. The room keys didn't work. They said that might happen and sent someone up, whom we tipped, he got us in our room, but the new keys didn't work either. GREAT NEWS: We got the mini grand suite at the end of the North Tower...faced back of Paris Hotel and if you squeezed your neck to the glass balcony--which does not open--you see front of Bellagio and dancing waters. (You can however hear the BOOM from the waters when the show is over each time.) The room was very nice with sunken jacuzzi but the furnishings seemed scratched up for a renovated room. Bed was very confortable. Guy told me to go to VIP window at check-in about cards, because now there was a huge line. She was going to get the Manager to take us up with cards but friends were waiting and I didn't want to waste the am with running up and down --room was far from check-in. This person was going to check on champagne too. We were out all day having a time and didn't stop back before the clerk left for the day. She left no keys for anyone to give us that she said the Manager would make, and no news about the champagne --she was checking on that for us. She was very nice, don't get me wrong, but it would have been great if a note was left --we did think we'd be back in time, but it's Vegas, baby! Anyway, got the keys right away from a gal who was great, her co-worker (young man) seemed a little snooty, but she again was great. The champagne saga continued everyday, when a young girl supervisor said they don't even have champagne~! Egaads--I even believed her until I looked at room service items. Boy do they have champagne~!! LOL. Anyway, called on our last night there, spoke to supervisor --told her long outdrawn story. She was going to give us the champagne~! Big whoop now that the bloom was off the rose, so to speak. So I told her that and asked her what else she could do. She gave us two breakfast buffets for Paris! That was truly great! All in all---Room was great. We didn't want maid service and just kept our do not disturb sign on the whole time. Before that, we got extra towels, shampoo and soap (even one lightbulb for the vanity that was missing--so we could be at peace. It was great. Maybe not the cleanest, but clean enough. (One pistachio was found under the coach.) We hardly played at Bally's but loved walking around Paris and ate most of our meals there that the buffet--it was excellent! Good news: You can use your comp card at both Bally's and Paris. (I think Caesar's too, but we never got over there.) However, the comp cards that were given to us at check-in were no good at the comp kiosk, so we had to get them \"activated\" with a pin number at the comp center ---which can take a very long time if there's a line. Activate it first thing at the center, so you can just print out comps. However, it seems like you need to spend to really get any comps at all. CHARTER FLIGHT: Bad thing is: if there is bad weather coming your way and your flight is delayed or cancelled--the airline FunJet works with (Ryan Airlines) only flies every Thursday and Sunday. We just beat the bad weather. You would get your money back, but out of luck in terms of them offering to place you on regular airlines as a backup. Also: Showtime shuttle service leaving hotel to airport is the pits! Had to wait 45 minutes, called and put on hold for 8 minutes (cost me $1 per min!) but got them to come. They said there was already a shuttle there (and there was --but the driver wouldn't let anyone on and said he was there for drop-off only!) I told dispatch supervisor, who does he want to believe, the 20 people waiting for the shuttle, or the one bus driver. Even the bellman was mad~! I suggest that whatever time you want to leave your hotel and get to the airport, pad it by an extra hour. That way if they're late, they'll be right on time! Also: Don't mention how much you hate Showtime to Ryan Airlines. We asked the girl for exit row seats, and they were all gone. Said we would have gotten there on time if it weren't for Showtime. Another girl was helping out giving her ideas on other good seats. When I asked the other girl what she meant, the first girl said, \"I'm handling it!\" Geez--you cannot ask anything from them anymore. We got flagged for extra security! But it was fast and quick. What a trip! Hope the little hints helped someone. Next time I would stay at Barbary Coast or Sahara --latter one now that monorail is working. All in all, good time in Vegas.

We were in Vegas from November 26 - 29, 2004! I thought Bally's was great! The first night were were upgraded to a suite, and it was beautiful with two separate vanities, a separate toilet and bidet room, and a huge jacuzzi tub. I did not check in at the airport (although I would have liked to!) because they said the computers were down at the airport (for Bally's only), and could not check us in. We arrived in the evening, and literally walked right up to the check in counter so we were glad to have no wait. After the first night in a suite, we stayed in a room for the next two nights in the North tower (which are the remodeled rooms) and our view was of the south end of the strip, including the Stratosphere and the mountains beyond. The room was fantastic too! I have no idea what the rooms in the South Tower (which have the partial view of the strip) look like, but I would bet that anyone who didn't like Bally's stayed there. We ate twice in the coffee shop (the name escapes me now) and both times the food was excellent. The casino was nice, big, and not smoky at all. My hubby enjoyed the poker room, and best of all (for us anyway!) it was smoke free. The indoor walkway to Paris is terrific for those cold desert nights in the winter. I've previously stayed at Excalibur (which is okay) and Bellagio. Bally's isn't as glamourous as Bellagio, but it's a good price for a great hotel!

We wanted a center strip location so that we could have easy access to all of the hotels. I had done some research on hotels and we selected Bally's based on it's location and moderate prices. Because I did the research, I knew what to expect and Bally's turned out to be exactly what I had read. First of all I highly recommend the airport check-in. When we arrived there was only 1 other person in front of us in line. You can also buy hotel shuttle tickets there for $5.50 each way. Bally's is the first stop for the shuttle so it's very quick. Besides the excellent location, the best feature of Bally's is the room. We paid the $20 upgrade for a North tower, newly renovated room. The room was very large, clean and in great shape. The decor was nice but nothing special. the bathroom has a lot of marble and is really nice. Only ding is water pressure is not great. I did not get to see any of the rooms in the South tower so I cannot say how much better the North tower is. In all honesty if I stayed there again I would not bother upgrading as we did not stay in the room that much. The casino is fine but nothing special compared to the newer hotels on the strip. It was not as busy as some of the other hotels. We are not big gamblers so it did not really make a difference. If I was going to spend a lot of time at the casino I would probably go next door to Paris which has an awesome casino. In fact Paris is connected to Bally's by a small mall. It is very convenient to walk over there and take advantage of that hotel which is spectacular! As far as service goes, the Housekeeping staff was by far the best. The room was always spotless and the staff always had a smile and friendly Hello in the hallways. The rest of the staff that I dealt with was so-so. The desk clerk who checked us in at the airport was not that friendly but she was efficient. Also I tried to find a Concierge but had no luck (in fact I ended up talking to a guy who I thought was the Concierge and it turned out that he was a timeshare salesman - LOL!!!) Had to wait in line at the front desk to check out - they had 3 people there but only one was waiting on people and there was a pretty good sized line. Then the one guy shuts down his station and we had to wait a few minutes for the next guy to open up. Wait staff in the restaurants and casino were efficient but nothing special. For breakfast we mainly grabbed some coffee and pastry in the lobby and brought it back to the room. There is a snack bar called Nosh and also a Java Coast(?) stand in the main lobby. They were both very good but expensive ($2.95 for a coffee - although it was great coffee). We also ate at the Big Kitchen Buffet for lunch and breakfast. The breakfast buffet is excellent - especially for $12.95 (plus you get 10% off with their slot club card). The lunch was good too but the Paris buffet is much better (and around the same price). We didn't eat at any of the other restaurants there. We also saw the Jubilee show which is a great, classic Las Vegas show. If you plan to see Jubilee I recommend that you buy the package deal with your room which gives you 2 for 1 tickets - it is a lot cheaper than buying a full price ticket ($65-70). In summary Bally's is a nice hotel, but compared so some of the others on the strip (e.g. Bellagio, Caesars, Mirage, Paris, etc.) it is behind the times. If it were located in any other city in the U.S. you would likely think it was wonderful, but for Vegas it is middle of the road. I would definitely recommend Bally's if you plan to be up and down the strip and you can get a good deal on the rooms. I would also look into Aladdin which I think is in the same price range as Bally's. It is a little bit south but close enough to everything and much nicer than Bally's. If and when I return to Vegas I would probably stay at a nicer place and forego the center strip location, but I have no regrets at all staying there.

I stayed in 1100 sq. ft. a one-bedroom parlor suite which was actually 2 rooms with the door open in between but was very nice, our particular room did not have much view but who cares? There were several little general stores directly behind the hotel which were excellent for stocking the room with beer, snacks etc. Never got to go to the buffet it closes at like 11am! Tried the one at Paris and was not impressed at all. Staff was very friendly no problems with check-in...checkout was another story.... The Casino was DEAD I have never been in a Casino that quiet in my life! If you gamble try elsewhere, the Barbary coast was excellent, younger crowd, very lively, excellent bands but not very large. A bit of an ordeal at check-out apparently they were charging the bill from another guest to our bill because the room numbers had gotten mixed up so it took a while to straighten out to the point we missed breakfast before our flight. I read other reviews were they said they try to sneak a charge for the safe on your bill and sure enough there it was! As soon as I questioned it the desk clerk said he would \"waive\" the fee, funny since we never even touched the safe!

I used the check-in at McCarran International Airport - this is highly recommended as others have mentioned. I had requested a King sized bed, but as I had arrived early (11:00am) they only had a double queen bed available. I had no problem with this. My room was in the South Tower, and as a previous advisor mentioned, you seem to have a choice between the older rooms in the South Tower with better views, or a better/refurbished room in the North Tower with perhaps not-as-nice views.. Opening my drapes I was staring straight at the Eiffel tower of the Paris Hotel, and was also able to see much of the fountain show at the Bellagio. The room itself seemed comparable to one I had stayed in months earlier at Treasure Island - Nothing too fancy but nice enough for me. I had no problems with housekeeping during my stay. Towels were replaced..all that good stuff. Some other thoughts: -The Monorail seems to be in a permanent state of broken. Who sold Vegas this thing, Lyle Lanley? (I'm a Simson's fan) -The lower level where the Sports Book, Pool, Spa are located seems a bit desolate. It doesn't seem like it is part of the hotel.... -The ability to access the Paris hotel is a definate plus. It's lovely and I preferred their casino to Bally's - but it's proximity means that you really have 2 hotels in one. So summing up, I enjoyed my stay at Bally's.

I checked in at Bally's check-in desk at the airport, which I would recommend, since it took less than 8 minutes to check in. I reserved my room on line about 4 months ago, and I got a $69 room rate for the first five nights. The room was not renovated, but it was so spacious and in such good shape that I called the front desk to reconfirm my rate. I was on the 10 floor, north tower, which is a non-smoking floor. The floor was very quiet--I hardly heard any noise. One minor complaint--the water pressure in the shower could have been a little better. Hotel staff I encountered were friendly. The Big Kitchen Buffet was pretty good, but I preferred the buffet at Paris. Guests at Ballys can eat at any restaurant at Paris, Caesars or The Flamingo and charge their meals to their hotel bill. I recommend getting the Bally's Connection Card even if you are going to just play the slot machines. I don't think I played that much compared to some people, and I got $49 off my bill and $11 cash back at check out. The Monorail was out of service the entire time I was there (9/19 to 9/25). I used the bus several times to go up and down the strip. Buy a $5.00 pass for 24 hours of unlimited bus rides. The light show on Fremont Street was great. Food prices in downtown Vegas seemed cheaper than on the strip. Rita Rudner puts on a very funny show at NY NY. The Neil Diamond impersonator at the Riviera was very good, but his show lasted barely one hour. La Cage female impersonators show at the Riviera were very funny.

We were asked if we wanted to be upgraded to a room facing the Bellagio fountions for an extra $20.00 per night and that sounded great so we jumped on it. Turned out we could only see about 1/8 of the fountains (about like looking out your front window at your lawn sprinkler). Service? None to speak of. Casino staff need a raise to at least put smiles on their faces. They were all very unfriendly and left you with a feeling that you shouldn't be bothering them to even take your money. Cocktail waitresses, good luck in tracking one down, and yes, most of the time you'll be the one walking around looking for them instead of them looking for you. The bright spot was the Big Kitchen Buffet, the best in Vegas!! The location, although set way off the street is still a good one and right in the middle of the strip. Here's one more tip-- when you're booking your stay, not just at Bally's but anywhere in Vegas, book it through the hotel and not an internet travel site. The internet sites will get you a room and airfare but unless you book directly through the hotel don't expect to get the \"advertised\" freebee's like free shows, 2 for 1 specials, discount coupon books and the rest of what you have read. Check directly with the hotels first to see what they offer.

In fact, in reading alot of the reviews here on Trip Advisor, I didn't quite know what to expect as far as my stay here at Bally's. First, I made my reservation online on August 6th, 2004, and requested my preference for a non-smoking room with king size bed. Of course in order to book your room, you have to pay for your first night in advance. In my case, it was $70.85 including taxes. My next 2 nights costs about $195.00 each, for a grand total of $495.00 . The reason I am even bringing this up is due to reading some of the other reviews on this site where some have been saying that they got such a great rate to stay here at Ballys, which makes me wonder if I went about making my resrvation the wrong way or should I have waited til almost time for me to leave Detroit before making my reservation? (last minute) Anyway, I arrived at Bally's about 2-1/2 hours early, (check in is 3pm) and even though the line was somewhat long, it moved quicker than one might expect. I would have been able to check in earlier than the official time, but my room wasn't ready, which wasn't a suprise since I did show up earlier than I was supposed to. I didn't want to pay the extra $20.00 per night to stay in a renovated room in the North tower, so I just took the room that was offered, which was located in the South tower. (room #7117 on the 21st floor) The room was on the plain side in terms of appearance, but was a nice size. I was suprised that a hotel of this size and class (rated 4 stars), didn't have a microwave in it. I called down to the front desk to inquire about it and was told by the lady who answered the phone that none of the rooms have microwaves. I later found out that this wasn't the case, the suites have microwaves and a mini fridge in them. I walked over to my window to look out and.....What a view!!! From the window in room 7117, you could see the Paris Hotel,(Bally's sister Hotel) the 1/2 scale replica of the Effiel tower, the large circular pool for Paris Hotel guests, a decent but not complete view of the Bellagio hotel across the street, with a partial view of the Bellagio fountain show. (awesome!) You can also have a very nice view of the strip, and can see Ceasar's Palace and far away in the background, you can see the back drop which is the mountains. Let me tell you, the view from my room and that high up in the south tower is simply awesome!!! For me, this was enough that I didn't care that I wasn't in a renovated room and from the impression I got, it's somewhat of a trade off...........stay in a older room and get a nice view of the strip if you are on a high enough floor, or pay an extra $20.00 per night to stay in a renovated room in the north tower with possibly a less than desireable view. The Big Kitchen Buffet (in Bally's) was nice and the staff was friendly and very attentive and provided very good service. They have a nice selection of different food, so you are bound to find something you have a taste for. Everything was fresh, the restaurant was very clean, so I do recommend eating at the Big Kitchen Buffet. Bally's staff was friendly and was helpful in answering any questions I had. I did utilize Bally's pool which is a nice size. I would advise getting to the pool by around 10am if you want to get a chaise lounge and have a better choice of where you want to set up poolside. You have the option of having drinks brought to you, since the bar is right there in the pool area. From the South tower, you have a nice little walk to get to the other side of the hotel to take the elevators down to the lower level where the shops are set up like that of a strip mall. The walk to the pool area is like a mini site seeing tour. The icecream kiosk wasn't open the whole time I was there at Bally's. (to my disapointment) I also recommend visiting the Indigo Lounge while staying at Ballys. They offer some nice live entertainment which is free! \"Cat Daddy's\" was good entertainment and great music! I like how Bally's and it's sister Hotel, Paris is connected. I'm not really a gambler, so I couldn't tell you anything about playing the slots or any of the tables. Also, I before comming to Las Vegas, I did as much reading about Bally's and Vegas as I could to help me make the most of my time there. I read about the Monorail having just opened up, but when I arrived in Vegas, it was down and stayed down during my stay in Vegas. The bus cost $2.00 each way to ride the strip, or you can pay $5.00, I believe to get a 24 hour pass to ride the bus. You could also rent a motor scooter from a rental place on the strip by paying a $200.00 deposit, in which your rental fee will be taken out of your deposit when you return the scooter. If you have a CVS Extra care card, bring it because they do have a huge CVS in Vegas on the strip as well as a Denny's restaurant and a Walgreens also located on the strip. I was amazed at the variety of places to eat and great prices. My first night in Vegas, I had a nice sirloin steak dinner with veggies, salad and soft drink for $7.95! While you're there, take the bus down the strip to downtown Las Vegas to Fremont street. There are more casinos at that end of the strip and you can also catch the light show which is awesome! That end of the strip is also where they have the big poker tournament that you may have seen advertised on TV and on the Travel Channel. In closing this review, I would advise not bringing children to Vegas. In my opinion, Vegas is for adults and things that aren't legal in other places is legal here in Vegas and in NV period. If there is any \"kid friendly\" place in Vegas, I wasn't aware of it. There are plenty of Adult entertainment news stands with free publications on the strip, out in the open for all to see. There are also plenty of people on the strip who's job is to pass out full color business cards of different strippers, escorts, call girls etc...to everyone who passes by and they didn't seem to care that some of the people had children with them. Bally's is a nice Hotel, it just doesn't have a theme like the other hotels. I would recommend Ballys to anyone. In fact, I will stay at Ballys again and will trying to get the same room (7117 in the south tower, 21st floor) because of the awesome view from that high up. Any of the odd number rooms on that floor will assure you of a nice view of the strip on the Las Vegas Blvd side. One other thing I almost forgot to mention is that if you are a Hilton Honors member, Bally's no longer accepts the Hilton Honors membership card, even though they haven't updated the Bally's website to reflect this. Bally's website is still showing across the bottom of the home page that they are still affiliated with Park Place entertainment, which is no longer the case. I would recommend signing up for a Bally's Connection Card, so you can get discounts at certain places affiliated with Bally's and earn comps for gambling and get a 3 percent rebate on your room.

It's mostly adults there and unless you get there early, you won't get a lounger. The only other thing I'd say about Bally's, is that it's not really a place to take the kids.

Someone decided it would be easier to round everone up if we all stayed at the same place. Our first impression of Bally's was one of total chaos. Upon our arrival four disinterested desk persons were checking in approx. 150+ people. It took us the better part of one hour to get checked in and we were in the forward third of the line. Once we got our room things took a turn for the better. The double room we got was large, clean and afforded a partial view of the strip. It was rather drab but you don't spend that much time in it anyway. The bathroom is an all in one type with vanity, toilet and tub in one room. This is inconvienent when both of you want to use a different facility at the same time. Towels were at as premium so don't drop them on the floor if you wish to shower morning and evening. And believe me you will if you go in August, the average temp was 110 during the day and never dropped below 94, even at 2 in the morning. There is no coffee maker in the room but we found the beds to be comfortable on the firm side. We ate at the buffet and found the main fare average. Deserts were delicious. If you want coffee get to the coffee bar early in the morning as a line forms fast. Apparently we weren't the only ones who wanted coffee in the morning. We did find the walkway to the Paris and located many small shops and food establishments which served everything from sandwhiches to expensive dinner. As a matter of fact, once we found the Paris was connected and next door we spent most of the next two days there instead of Bally's. The casino at Bally's is best described as average. Nothing spectacular and nothing other than table games shrouded in smoke. Tried a few of the machines but after dropping my limited limit without so much as a single cherry payout I migrated next door to the Paris where the machinery seemed much more user friendly. The one thing about Bally's that can't be beat is the location. You will be directly across from the Ballagio and kitty corner to Ceasars. Almost centrally located in the middle of the strip. With the addition of overpasses on the intersection there is no traffic to hassle. The bus, the best value in town is a short walk away. Buy the all day pass as the bus runs every 15 to 20 minutes and you save a fortune on cabs. Remember if you go in the middle of July or August the temp. will be a killer and you just can't walk any distance in comfort. We found when the 110 degree wind blew it was even difficult to breath. And the wind does blow. In summary, Bally's is a bargain if your looking for a basic, tired rather dated property in a central location. The price will probably justify the lack of frills and nicities that one would find in a more expensive hotel.

We weren't sure what to expect, after reading the wide variety of reviews, but we were hoping for the best. - the price was right, anyway (we got a great deal through our travel agent)! We were not disappointed! We arrived well before the stated check in time of 3pm, and so we checked our bags with them. The man who checked our bags was professional, friendly, and courteous, and we were assisted immediately upon arrival. We spent some time getting oriented to the hotel/casino before we checked in. The casino is spacious and clean, and I was surprised at how non-smoky it was, despite the fact that everyone was smoking. When we decided to try to check in a little early at 2pm (the official check in time is 3pm), there was no problem whatsoever. There was literally NO line; the room was available early for us, and we were even upgraded for free to a larger room that included a refrigerator at no extra charge. The woman who assisted us was friendly, cheerful, and knowledgeable. The room was VERY spacious and spotlessly clean. It didn't look new, but it wasn't worn down at all. The bedspread had a tiny hole in it - that's all I can find to complain about, haha. It was a non-smoking room, and there was no odor at all - the entire floor was non-smoking. Everything in the room was in working order, aside from the in-room fridge, which we had been warned about at the front desk. As promised, a working fridge was delivered to us within ten minutes. The bathroom was clean, and the water pressure and temperature were fantastic. Even the toiletries they provided were nicer than average, and they were refreshed every day. Our bags were brought to us immediately after we requested them, and the man who brought them was friendly and shared recoomendations with us for shows to see and things to do while we were there (shows OUTSIDE of Bally's), and housekeeping was extremely quick and friendly in accomodating our request for extra pillows. Later in our stay, they provided us with extra towels for our trip to Wet N Wild without blinking an eye. Our room was cleaned every day, earlier than we expected. The dining at Bally's was great. The buffet was very crowded in the evening, as is to be expected, but we ate breakfast there every day but the first. Great price (especially with the 10% discount you get from using their Comp card) and terrific food, with lots of variety - you can get dinner at breakfast time, for those who haven't been to bed yet. Breakfast buffet was not crowded at all if we got there early, and the staff was VERY friendly and accomodating. As it gets busier, they get more hurried and kind of rush you along, so the earlier the better. One night, the couple in the room next to ours was having a very loud argument, and we ended up calling down to security. Security promptly dealt with the situation, and they were very friendly and understanding when I called. The television went on the fritz one day, and when I called down to maintenance, they told me that they were aware of the problem and were working on it. They called back about 45 minutes later to check if it was working, and they were friendly, as well. We used express check-out, which was great and hassle-free, and we checked our bags again, as we had a late flight. We were attended to promptly when we reclaimed our bags, and we were assisted in finding airport transportation by Bally's staff. We had an extremely satisfying experience, and I would be completely comfortable recommending Bally's Las Vegas to anyone.", "Date": "August 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Overall Stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2477724", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights at Bally's, had nearly zero complaints.

We did the \"Guy's Getaway Package\" which was a phenomenal value. $795 per night (2 night minimum) got us a 1,600 square foot suite which had it's own jacuzzi, 3 TV's, 2 toilets with 4 sinks, an in-room bar, 1 king bed, 1 shower, 4 sofas and a chaise lounge. The package also included $250 towards dinner at the Bally's Steakhouse, $100 towards a bar tab at any Bally's lounge, $100 in match play at the casino, 1 bottle of Jack Daniels, 1 bottle of Ketel One Vodka, sandwiches upon check-in, and free use of a 6-passenger limo for 2 hours. We were able to accomodate 10 guys in the room, even though I'm sure we were technically not allowed to. This is probably the best deal of its kind in Las Vegas (on the Strip, at least). When I was shopping around, the closest deal was at the Palms, but they wanted $2,000 per night. The suite itself was in very good condition, but the hotel overall has a very aged feel about it. The crowd that was staying there seemed older than most (also lots of families) and you won't find the attractive crowd that you would find at the newer hotels on the strip. We walked over to the Bellagio and were amazed at how many more beautiful women were there. Bally's seemed to attract a much more \"working-class\" crowd. The lobby had a very gawdy 1970's look to it and the hallways leading to the rooms were very dark. The casino was smaller than average, but had lower minimum bets that the others. On the plus side: the service was very good. We were amazed at how quickly people arrived at our door when we called. The Steakhouse was also a really big hit with the guys. The experience was very similar to what you would find at Smith & Wollensky, but I would say that the steak at Bally's was actually a little better. Don't order any side dishes though, they are overpriced and the portion sizes of the side dishes are tiny. Despite it's shortcomings in appearance, it's in a great location (connected to the Paris hotel and a short walk to the Bellagio) and we found the service to be better than at the larger hotels where every guest is just an anonymous face.

There was a problem with the room service food. Some of my food arrived at the room amost cold and an item was left off the breakfast. I complained to room service and suggested they make a 2 or 3 dollar adjustment. To my amazement, room service personnel dispatched someone to retrieve the food which I had complained about. He said an adjustment could not be made without the food being returned. Absolutely amazing. Imagine someone being sent to retrieve a waffle !!!! Since I had started to eat with my wife, there was no waffe exchange and no adjustment made. Imagine: a person employed just to retrieve a waffle !!!. Very, very poor treatment for anyone, much less someone staying there for 5 days. A possible loss of 35 cents or maybe up to one dollar for a supposedly 4 star casino.

I personally have stayed at Bally's every time I've been to Vegas, once or twice a year since 1997. This time I left my husband with the kids and went with the girls. We checked in at the airport. This was my first time using airport check in. I was given a room in North Tower (per my request). I also asked if they had any upgraded rooms. The mini suites all have king size beds, which would not work for 3 people. We were told we had a larger room. The room was the same as every other room I have stayed in (with the exception of the mini suite, which I stayed in on my first trip there). I was extremely disappointed to walk into a room that was dirty, with towels and garbage everywhere, especially since I had told the girls how great Bally's was. We were moved to a clean room on the same floor. They informed me they have been having computer problems and the room was \"clean\" in their system. Our new room was spotless. I think they could have comped us a meal or something due to the inconvenience (I even asked), but nothing was offered. We stayed on the 15th floor. The view was not great but I spend very little time in the room. We wanted the North tower due to the location in relationship to the pool. Our room looked relatively new, however, as stated above, I've been going there since 1997 and never had an issue with the quality of the room. The only suggestion I have is to put the sink and mirror outside of the bathroom so we could get ready quicker. I can't comment much on the restaurants at Bally's. The only places we ate on the property were the pool and the buffet in Paris. The buffet was the best I've ever had. My husband and I normally go to just one buffet during our trips to Vegas. We've been to Treasure Island, Rio, Bally's (two or 3 times) and the Paris Buffet is superior in quality, value, etc. We went at 3:30 and it was still considered lunchtime. We could not imagine what else they could have at dinner. The location of Bally's makes it the best value on the strip. You are directly across the street from Bellagio. The pool area is very nice and clean. In the casino, drinks are served in glasses, bottles, etc. No cheap plastic cups. They have a good selection of drinks. Waitresses are always coming by. As far as the slots, they were relatively loose. I came home with some of the money I took (which to me is a win). Our check out was flawless. I had enough comp $$$ to almost pay for one night. I am not a high roller; I play 25-cent slots and 3-card poker!!! I used my connection card each time I played at Bally's, Paris, Caesars and Flamingo. I always receive great rates and promotions from Bally's and Paris. We are already planning another girl trip for next year.

The wood is very dark and old-looking, the bedspread was an older style and definitely had some wear and tear, but the room was clean and it was HUGE! The best part of Bally's is the location. You are connected to the Paris hotel, a skywalk away from the Bellagio, and a skywalk away from the Barbary Coast (cheap fun gambling there, including 5 cent video blackjack!)

I think Bally's was the perfect size. It was about a $12 cab fare from the airport. The buffet was ok, the Bellagio buffet was much better for only $6 more. The \"Nosh\" cafe was very good, and there is a Sbarro in the lower level for a snack. The other restaurants looked great though we didn't try them.

Amazingly, check in was a breeze and we were upgraded, no cost, to one of the remodeled rooms. I heard this upgrade is $20 a night and after seeing the room, would have paid it without hesitation. The room was large, clean and very comfortable. Our set of elevators were closer to the casino which is always a perk. The staff members were friendly and accomodating, for the most part. I did have a few complaints. After being at a craps table for hours at $10 minimum, they raised it to $15 at 4:00 a.m. Strange time to increase bets. Usually when a bet is increased, they grandfather you in. Not this time. I eventually realized they wanted to close the table and hoped to force us out by raising the minimum. Nice. Also the pool, although not very crowded, was a disappointment. Pool time is a highlight for me while in vegas. Only 1 bar, no cocktailers (this may change in summer months, we were lucky enough to enjoy 90 degree heat in March), and overall unimpressive when compared to some of the flashier pools.

Would not stay here again!! Heres the story. We made reservations 6 months in advance because we were attending a wedding at Ceasars Palace. When we checked in I requested a renovated room if they had one and a decent view. They said they only had a double bed room available. I told them we reserved a King size bed room and I asked for an upgraded room since they were unable to accomadate us according to our reservation. The reply was when we booked (remember 6 months in advance) there is no guaranteee we would get the room we requested. They gave us a double bed room to sleep the night and said we would have to change rooms in the morning. The night clerk assured me we'll give you a renovated room with a view at no extra charge in the morning. Do you believe Ballys Casino asks for $20.00 per night extra for a room with new carpet, new bedspread, new drapery, clean walls??? He went so far as to show us a picture of the room they have in a binder at the desk. He indicated he would pass along the room number to the morning staff and we should call the desk when we get up. We had no choice but to sleep the night. It was already 12:30 am and we were exhausted from traveling all day. When we got up to our room it was HORRIBBLE!!! Old dirty carpet with stains all over, drapes that needed to be cleaned, dingy bedspreads and marked up walls. And when we opened up our drapes we saw nothing but a rooftop. No Las Vegas lights just a huge rooftop. The next day we had planned a breakfast with the Bride and Groom and family we hadn't seen in years. I called the desk in the morning (as the night clerk indicated) and asked about the time for that renovated room. The desk said \"You are in a renovated room!!\" I said we are not. I told her the night clerk assigned us a room on a higher floor that he said was renovated and also we do not have the King size bed we reserved. I indicated the night clerk had showed me a picture of the renovated room and that was the one we were interested in. She insisted we have a renovated room and assigned room number on a lower floor. (I was told the higher floors are the renovated floors). Well at this point I had enough. I went down to the desk and explained the entire situation to yet another clerk. (Had to stand in line for about 20 minutes) At this point I was really annoyed and frustrated. We had to sleep in this shabby room , we were totally inconvenienced because we were unable to unpack , was running late for the breakfast party with the Bride and Groom and had to re-explain the whole situation to the morning clerk at the desk. She said she didn't know what I meant by the renovated room. I said pull out the binder with the laminated room pictures in them so I can show you. OH BINGO!!! Now she knows what I mean. It was 9:00 am and to put the icing on the cake, do you believe she asked us if we could be out of thie room by 10:00 am to do the switch? I indicated we were already late for our breakfast party and we may be out of our room by 10:30 am. After breakfast, (of course before switching rooms) I looked at the new room. It was exactly like the old room but with clean carpet, clean walls, clean drapery and clean bedspread. Just an OK view. At least the room wasn't old and shabby. I dont think I could stand the other room for four days. Wouldn't you think since we were totally inconvenienced, and they did not have the accomadations we reserved that they would maybe upgrade our room? or maybe get us a better view? Possibly facing the strip? I know things happen but if Bally's had tried to accomadate us with a few extras because of our inconvenience the first night I would feel different right now. I will never return to Ballys again. We paid full price for our room and expecting the King size bed we reserved, clean drapery, clean walls and clean bedspread is not too much to ask.

Here's a nice little tip, use the Bally's / Caesar's hotel check-in desk located at the airport, it only had about 5 people in line when we got there and we had our room keys and all in less than 15 minutes or so. It's off to the rental car and straight to the room from there. How could you go wrong with that? I tried in vain to talk my way into a 'strip' view room. I mentioned to the pretty young desk clerk that I had worked for Bally's in Atlantic City, no go though. She said, \"A strip view would be another $30 per night.\" \"We will have the desert view,\" I cheerfully offered up! She had me checked in within 2 minutes! Not quite that is what we ended up with but, we were only in our room to sleep and then it was out and up early back to the sightseeing trail. We got our king bed with 'no smoking' and it was very nice. Parking your car is yet another matter though. You can use the Paris Hotel parking garage as the two properties are joined and owned by the same company. The walk is tedious though, quite long. We used the Bally's self park which is accessible via Tropicana ave. around the back of the property on a surface lot. You may want to valet, that of course is a nice thing. Plenty of nice restaurants inside of Bally's. The Big Kitchen buffet is ok, nothing gourmet here. Just as advertised you get your food in what appears to be a big kitchen... Try the MGM Grand buffet instead at $21.99 during the week it was tops in our agenda. This is 4 stars. Get there early though, they get a crowd here. The Paris Hotel has a wonderful buffet as well called \"Le Buffet\", we had the $12.95 breakfast buffet that had everything but the kitchen sink, bravo! All in all, I would stay here again, although we both would probably see what the more upscale Paris Hotel would offer us on our next trip to Las Vegas.", "Date": "April 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cNot a 4-star at all\u201d", "Author": "baltcate58", "ReviewID": "UR1790335", "Content": "1.

I found the rooms very nice, spacious & clean, the maid service efficient and daily, and had a great view outside. The room includes a safe they say charges $3 a day for use but I never did get charged for using it every day. The location was great, in the middle of the strip, and fairly quiet given the fact that it IS Las Vegas. It is also right across the street from Caesars Palace and the Bellagio; we could actually watch the dancing lights & fountain right out our window, and we had a great view of the Eiffel Tower. We were on the 18th floor and given that it is a party town, things were pretty quiet as far as other tenants go. Bottled water in the room was $4.50 USD a bottle, so I just drank out of the tap. What I was unimpressed with was that the spa and gym facility that they advertise as a drawing feature costs TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY just to go for a weight workout or a run on a treadmill. This is ridiculous. I can understand the spa costing money but not a regular fitness gym - most hotels include this. Twenty bucks a week is nominal but this was too much. I never got to eat at Ballys much because we were usually far off at a different end of the strip at mealtimes. Food could be very reasonable at the lower end of the strip (Westward Ho casino had great food for a good price) and little more expensive at the fancier end, but the portions were all great everywhere we went and we never felt ripped off. Some advice to anyone going to Vegas - if you're going to sightsee and just have a quieter fun time, go during the week (Sunday to Thursday) because the weekends are crazy! Most casinos have standing room only on weekends and the food lineups are UNREAL. Also, trying to get in on the lower-limit gaming tables on the weekend is nigh impossible. (Hey, I'm not a big spender!) However, if you're a party animal and want things rockin', the weekend in Vegas is packed, and the booze & gaming goes 24 hours a day. And bring lots of cash - not much in Vegas is cheap! Don't rush out and pay full ticket for any shows - you can usually find a two for one coupon SOMEWHERE being handed out for any given show. There is also a discount shop (covered with yellow flags and ribbons) near the Harley Davidson Cafe that sells certain tickets for same-day shows for 1/2 price - so check it out before you pay $50 or $100 each and then find out you could have saved 1/2 cost!", "Date": "February 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1665867", "Content": "My buddy and I stayed there for a bachelor party the weekend of Feb. 20th.

Because I was with a group, I got a rate of $80.00 per night. I was skeptical, because from the outside Bally's isn't much to look at. I've stayed at Bellagio, Mirage, Mandalay Bay and Paris and figured nothing would really compare. As soon as I opened the door to my room, I was really impressed. The room was huge, and the decor was pleasant and up-to-date. I'm a big fan of nice bathrooms, and I was very pleased with Bally's. The entire bathroom was done in granite, with very nice fixtures. The tub and shower were clean and big (not oversized per-se, but not at all cramped.) Bally's casino is small, but that isn't necassarily a bad thing. One of the best things about Bally's is that without going outside you can access all of Paris, and its shopping, casino and restaurants. If you like good coffee, there is a fun place in the walkway between Bally's and Paris. The \"Big Kitchen Buffet\" isn't as extensive as some others, but for the price I can't complain. Additionally, the waitstaff was very friendly, which goes a long way for me. I have always liked Bally's 24 hour coffee shop - the Sidewalk Cafe. This visit was no different. I also ate at Al Dente, which is a fine Italian restaurant. I enjoyed my experience there - its very pleasant inside, but it wasn't the best Italian meal I've ever had. I'm sure it doesn't hold a candle to Valentino (at the Venitian and Los Angeles). Another convenience Bally's offers is the ability to charge anything to your room at any of their hotels (Park Place Entertainment - Caesar's Palace, Flamingo, Paris, Bally's and the LV Hilton). For $80 I frankly thought it was a steal, and wouldn't hesitate to go back. I think I would stay there even if the price was $120 per night, though at that price I would stay at Paris, Mandalay, Bellagio and perhaps Mirage or Treasure Island ahead, if they were all equally priced - simply because its kind of fun to have the theme aspect.", "Date": "December 31, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorrible!

We could walk to the Bellagio's fountain show, and its renowned lobby in five minutes. Could walk to the Paris hotel and shops in five minutes (without going outside). Walked to the Flamingo's great buffet in ten minutes. Self-parking is a little far (in Paris hotel); but valet parking is so convenient to use. Kids will like the Houdini magic shop off the lobby.

I travel to Vegas often (2-4 times a year) and was reluctant to stay at Bally's this time around (we usually stay at Caesar's - EXCELLENT if you stay in the newest tower, but you'll pay for it or the Flamingo - great rooms on 28th floor, great slots!), but it was overall really nice. The rooms are about twice the size of any other hotel that I've stayed at in Vegas (I've stayed at TI, Flamingo, Caesar's, Bellagio, Excalibur, MGM, and Tropicana). The rooms were fairly clean and the bathroom was clean, but very plain looking. Our view wasn't much, but we got a cheap rate, so it wasn't a big deal. The room service has much more variety and is MUCH cheaper than any other hotels I've stayed at in Vegas. I didn't order the room service, but I sure thought about it because the prices were right. The pool is very nice if you like to swim. The pool goes from shallow to deep and is olympic sized. There weren't many people out by the pool when I was there, but it was also close to 100 degrees out. One warning: there is not much shade by the pool, so make sure to bring a couple of bottles of water with you when you go. I ate at the Japanese place on the way to the pool -- it was ok for the price. Not authentic, but not totally fast food tasting. I also ate at the main dinning area (forget what it's called) -- the service was bad, the food was ok. The buffett there was AWESOME though. I'm not a big buffett fan, but we went to this one for breakfast and they had EVERYTHING you could ever hope for. The only complaint I have about this hotel is that I lost too much money (haha) and on a more serious note, there were moths everywhere in the room - the hallway - every where. I killed at least 10 per day. Apperntly in late May, moths get attracted to this hotel and I was told that it was a rare occurance, but it was disgusting and annoying. I would not stay at this hotel in May, but would be willing to give it a shot again in the winter for a good rate. If not for the moth problem, I would rate this hotel excellent.", "Date": "December 17, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgreat except for my winnings......\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1513426", "Content": "which were nonexistant!
