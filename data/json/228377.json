At 50 euros a night, I don't expect something spectacular but it was quite wonderful anyway. It's a block from the famous Kadewe shopping center with loads of cafes along its street. It's 1/2 block away from the closest metro station Augsburger Strasse. Note that such station does not have escalator / elevators (as many metro stations don't). From airport you may take a bus to zoologischer garten station, where you can take a metro change to there (which requires line change for that 2 stations distance and ups/downs of stairs during the change) or walk from there to hotel that needs about 10-15min. I guess they upgraded our room so it was quite big with a balcony (kinda useless in winter) where we can see the quiet street and its neighbourhood. The rooms + beds are basic (the professional photos would've fooled you) but clean and comfy. Hotel staffs are friendly and helpful responding inquiries in perfect English. There's also a gym + spa + sauna facility upstairs at 6th floor. One small complaint would be the free WIFI. Though free, it needs a unique user/password pair per day per device - kind of annoying, and the service gets cut off easily when I reached my room.

Extremely clean and well-furnished. We felt very safe while here, and the room was very quiet with a nice view of the courtyard and a view of the street between neighboring buildings. The rooms were a little small compared to what I'm used to in the U.S., but certainly adequate and the quality of our stay was enough to make all the difference! The beds and pillows were very comfortable, and the linens delightfully fresh! My only complaint was that the duvet thing provided was WAY too hot! The room is kept warm enough you could sleep with just a sheet though. There are no in-room temperature controls, but even as picky as I am I had no issue. It was incredibly cold outside and the entire hotel was perfectly warm without being suffocating. The bathroom, always a telling point of any hotel room, was very nice! Everything was impeccably clean, but remember to leave the door cracked when taking a hot shower as there is no vent fan. I was unfortunately very ill on our trip to Berlin, and the hotel staff at the desk showed great concern for me once it was mentioned by our guide. There were members of our group who had last-minute changes in their room preferences and the staff were very quick and friendly about accommodating them. There seemed to be a lot of rooms available, even though there were people seemingly everywhere. It was a busy, but polite and inviting place. The restaurant downstairs was very nice. We visited for dinner one night and had great food at the usual price for dinner anywhere out in Germany. The restaurant staff was perfect. The breakfast included in our tour looked like it was good, but unfortunately I am not a morning person and was unable to enjoy any since I always feel worse in the mornings when sick. As with most hotels, the snacks and fizzy beverages in the fridge will cost you if you partake. Bring your own snacks/drinks and save the money!

If it weren\u2019t for this unfortunate circumstance, we admit that we probably would not have booked at the Alsterhof due its lower ranking and room pictures in the Tripadvisor, which were not appealing. The rooms at the Alsterhof did NOT have air conditioning. While we were in Berlin on 8-10 June 2010, the outside temperature ranged 28-30 degree Celsius so it was hot out. And in the rooms, we felt steamy and sweated through the nights in spite of having opened the windows. Although some of the rooms did have portable electric fans, they did little in cooling off the sauna-like rooms. If you like sleeping naked but still drenched in sweat during the summer, then this hotel is for you. On a more positive note, this hotel is centrally located, very near to Kadewe, one of Berlin\u2019s largest up-market department stores. Additionally, we felt that the breakfast was decent.

Cons: - quite distant from main attractions in the east side of the city, though it's easy to get there with the public transportation. - U-bahn line that runs near the hotel is relatively uncentral (but you can change trains as much as you want so it's not a big issue). - No air condition (only heating that works whenever the hotel wants) - equipment in the room (telephone, heating) has German instructions on it, no english.

The ticket machines are easy to use too, touch the screen and then choose English. The airport is in Zone B, but literally everywhere else we went in Berlin (including our hotel) was in Zone A so the tickets were easy to buy as it was the same one every time. We bought single tickets on each journey but I would suggest you buy a travel card (tagaskarte) which are on sale at the ticket office. There are no ticket barriers at any of the stations and I didnt see a single inspector in the 4 days I spent there but if you do get caught you will be charged 40 euros so better to be safe than be sorry. The hotel staff are polite and the room is clean and the bed was so comfy I didnt want to get up! I would suggest you learn some basic German before you arrive because the German people will be so much nicer to you if you at least TRY to speak German. We visited Checkpoint Charlie (very small so try to get there early before it gets busy), Topographie des Terrors (is outside and is all in German unless you buy the audio guide, but is also right next to the largest standing part of the Berlin Wall), The Story of Berlin (only really worth a visit for the tour down to the nuclear shelter), The Siegessaule (a walk through the park on the way is relaxing), The Reichstag (the queue was too long and didnt appear to be moving so we didnt go inside), Zoologischer Garten (fabulous day out, especially if you have children), The film museum (for fans of German film only), Fernsehturm (enjoy a drink in the bar at the top if you dont suffer from vertigo!), and of course The Brandenburg Gate (a passing glance was enough, but a sit outside the coffee shop to watch the crowds go by is even better). We were sight seeing from 10am till closing time every day and we still didnt see everything we wanted to. In the evenings we ate in local German restaurants that were recommended in the Time Out guide but the best meal we had was in Henne in Leuschnerdamm 25. The only thing on the menu is half a milk roasted chicken and you can choose between potato or cabbage salad (although we had both and shared) but it was the most delicious chicken I have ever tasted. Crispy on the outside, moist and succulent on the inside. The waitresses were lovely, and especially friendly when we tried to talk German to them and it was jam packed full of Germans.

It had all the usual, egg, bacon, cheeses etc but no smoked salmon and was not great for a 4 star hotel. It done its job but didn't make you want to refill your plate a second time.

It was fantastic. The Hotel was very good. Great great location, within walking distance of great shopping, xmas markets, the zoo, the main train station etc... and there is a U bahn station just outside the doorstep. When we checked in, there were candles all round the reception, they advised us that the hotel had no power between 1-6pm. We were out most of the afternoon anyway so it wasnt too much bother. When we returned however we were promised candles in our room by one receptionist and then it was not fulfilled. They didnt really know what to offer as light. They said we werent allowed candles. Im guessing because of fire or smoke risk however we were in a smoking room!? Anyway they eventually found us a flashlight that we had to use for an hour. The reception staff are fairly helpful, however do speak very good english. Our room was a lovely size, it was a double room, however two twin beds pushed together, however it didnt bother me. The bathroom was a nice size as well, with lovely bath and powerful shower. Everywhere was so clean and tidy. Just one tip for English people, the hotel does not have tea and coffee making facilities in the room and they also dont have english tea. closest you'll get is scented tea. As for breakfast, it was delightful. Lots of choice, we went down late both days so it was very busy so I would advise to go down earlier. On offer was Tea, coffee, fruit juices, Cereals, Bread and Rolls, Croissants, Pastries, Fruit Salad, Yoghurts, Dried Fruit, and Hot food including bacon, scrambled eggs, minced meat balls, boiled eggs, baked beans, and potatos. And to finish pancakes with maple syrup yum yum! You cant go far wrong with a breakfast like that to start the day. As for the evening the restaurant we found wasnt very popular with guests. It was very expensive in relation to some of the other eating places around but I guess it is a four star hotel. there was only 4 other people in the restaurant when we went in, so no atmosphere. If you want a great meal for next to nothing money, just turn out of the hotel and turn right. At the traffic lights turn right again and on the right hand side there is a restaurant called Toro Negro. Very busy, all candle lit, great atmosphere, great music. Its a spanish run place but they do all sorts of food. Pizza, pasta, mexican, tapas, Salads etc... We had Camebert, Large Rump Steak with Chips, Mozzerella and Herb pizza, 2 fantas, Crepes with icecream, 2 beers, and 1 wine and it came to 34 Euros! How cheap is that? The waitresses speak fairly good english as well. So overall the hotel was very good for what we paid for it, other than the electricity problem, we had a great time, and I would throughly recommend a stay in Berlin and a stay in this Hotel!", "Date": "December 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel-aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3985097", "Content": "We have just returned from a week in Berlin at the Alsterhof Hotel.

A problem with our safe was dealt with quickly and effectively. On our last morning the reception staff arranged for us to have breakfast before 6.00 as we needed to be away early for our flight.

Sure, the Alsterhof is in a great location, but I liked the nice big king-sized bed at the Marriott, and both are convenient to Berlin's extensive public transport.

The staff were plentiful and polite, the rooms clean and professional and the location was perfect. As a general guide the hotel is situated 1 block away from one of the main shopping centers of Berlin. Everything from the zoo to bars were within meters of the Alsterof, not that this mattered as the underground in Berlin is so extensive that every street corner seemed to has access. The breakfast was your usual choice of fruits, juices and grills and the bar is relaxing but a little pricey. Internet access in the foyer was free and 24 hours. Despite going in the middle of many snow storms the rooms were so cosy it was quiet a shock stepping back outside! Can highly recommend trying the small and local bars that appear randomly in the surrounding area. Most we tried came from a leaflet available in the foyer called \"Insomnia\", which if followed leads you to some character rich venues, all of which seem to have love for strange cocktails and low lighting.

My first big tip for you is if you are a non-smoker, when checking in make sure you request a non-smoking room, even if you have done so in your booking. We were given a smoking room and the smell was pretty bad. Apart from that, the bed was very small, barely a double size, and the bathroom was miniscule. Second tip - they don't provide any toiletries (shampoo/soap/conditioner) so a good idea to take your own. But the room was clean, there was no noise from any other room or outside and there was a fan in the room although it wasn't hot enough to use it! With the windows open there was a fair amount of street noise although it was quite cool so we kept them shut. Breakfast was fantastic, hot and cold buffet with everything you could want. The pancakes are great, like real American pancakes, not French crepes!! Berlin is an amazing city, and now tops my list of favourites! We recommend catching a train out to Savignyplatz and eating at the Zillemarkt restaurant there - the meals are massive, and scurmptious, and cheap!!

Free internet point in reception (if you can grab a free computer) Very clean standard room, but no freebies in the bathroom!
