This San Diego version had a warm and consistent daily welcome, good colour scheme (i.e. not that eternal beige experience you get across the USA), my room was not carpeted!! quality facilities and provisions - for the price $sub 200, it was ideal. The hotel is dark wood, sophisticated style which i hate to say (knowing how i dislike being marketed to) worked for me... Situated at the top of 5th street and core of gaslamp quarter it you have been to san diego before you will know it is really a one street (5th) town with a convention sprawl water front and then not much else in terms of charming bits - so this hotel gives you that advantage. Good hotel bar, breakfast is quite average and dull but why stay in - probably the reason it is sub-quality.

We did not travel with our dog for this trip, but enjoyed the property anyway. The pool area was so nice (and they arranged for a lovely warm, sunny afternoon [not unusual in San Diego]).

I felt a little like Alice in Wonderland going in. The front desk personnel were extraordinarily helpful - just what I expect from Kimpton Hotels.

The service was outstanding (front desk, in-room, catering, AV etc). Some of the meeting attendees had MAJOR problems with the room block (the site would not recognize them and kept quoting them a $500 a night cost which was about $360 above what the room block was actually priced.) This caused significant problems with several of the attendees. Then, one of our attendees was \"walked\" (hotel was over-booked and they did not have a room for her, even tho she had a guaranteed reservation.) They put her in another Kimpton 8 blocks away but they did comp her the one night's lodging. The beds and bathrooms were fantastic (rain shower with the best water pressure I've seen in years. Made me wonder how this fits the current water restrictions standards from the federal government) . The conference registrants were raving about the rooms, the location and most of all-the GINORMOUS front metal door that swings on a pin. Everyone was fascinated with it. The only problem (outside of the forced \"walk\" of a registrant) is that I was awakened at 5 am with a foul, FOUL smell coming into my room. (I was street facing, 3rd floor). After a few minutes,the smell was just as (if not) stronger. I wondered if I needed to get out of bed, get dressed and outside-due to some plumbing/chemical leak. Instead, I called the front desk who informed me that the House of Blues Restaurant (right next door) was cleaning their grease traps. Could not go back to sleep so I was up from 5 am on. The smell continue for 30-40 minutes and was still lingering in my room that afternoon.

The restaurant food was excellent, though pricey (but nothing too unreasonable). We didn't have much trouble finding the hotel, but it took us a little while to figure out that you just had to pull up in front of it (there's no real pullout for it) and wait for the valet.

The staff are exceptional, very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the area dining, activites etc. Especially the coolster Concierge Michael Chacon, he is in the know about everything San Diego, and helpful in arranging anything needed.

The hotel has recently been taken over by Kimpton and fully redone, and it looks great, very modern. The location is pretty good, right downtown and walking distance to lots of restaurants and the shopping centre. The rooms are smallish, which is to be expected for the location. We arrived early and were able to check in right away, which was appreciated. We were \"upgraded\" to a room with a balcony - I wouldn't pay extra for this, as the balcony is tiny (no room for a chair) and there is no view to speak of. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, if a little soft. The bathroom has just a sliding door on it, there is no separate door for the toilet area, and the shower has just a half glass wall, so you'd better be comfortable with your travelling partner. The shelf in the shower is slanted, presumably so water doesn't pool on it, but the unfortunate consequence is that toiletries have a tendancy to slide right off the shelf and onto the shower floor. There is no tub, which was fine for us but may be an issue for others. There is no carpeting in the rooms as it is all hardwood - fine for us, but those travelling with children may have an issue with this. Parking is $36 valet, and there is no self-parking on the site, though this is fairly standard for an older building in the downtown area. The valet staff were very prompt and friendly. The hotel offers free wi-fi. There are no ice machines available, but the front desk staff will happily provide ice on request. There are also no water/pop machines on the floors, but there is a drug store across the street from the hotel.

I had a balcony that could fit 8-10 people comfortably. Two robes, one (large) in the closet(Leopard) and one laying on the bed (Zebra). Three closets, one in the living area, two (small) in the bedroom area, of which one had an elite Keurig coffee machine with contents. Two flat screen t.v.'s, one in the bedroom and one in the living room area. Two bathrooms, one when you initially walk into the suite and the other in the actual bathroom area. The bedroom bathroom, which was huge, had a separate tub and rainforest shower. And I did use both. I liked the hardwood floors throughout the suit and also the retractable glass sliding doors. Each day, my room was cleaned and one night, I was on my balcony and I heard some noise in the room so I went in to look around and I was scared at first, but then I saw a woman who was only putting a fresh bag of ice in the room. How nice?!?! I didn't eat in the restaurant, but I did use the commentary happy hour in the lounge area. It gets pretty crowded too, which is nice for socializing. Be careful is you aren't used to the modern way of doing things, this hotel has unisex bathrooms in the dining area upstairs... I have to give it up to the Palomar. I didn't want to leave. The staff greets you with open arms and you can tell that they love their jobs.

It's hard enough to travel with pets, and finding a luxury hotel that accepts them (and with open arms) is more tough. The staff had great suggestions on parks, bars and restaurants where dogs are welcome. They also had dog treats waiting for them upon check-in, dog beds set up in our room, along with food and water bowls. We didn't use their other dog services, but frequently saw the staff members providing dog-walking and dog-sitting services for other guest. It's very unusual to find such a nice hotel that provides those services as well. As far as the location, it can't be beat. Right in the heart of downtown San Diego, surrounded by plenty of restaurants, shops and bars. Walking distance to plenty more than you would want to do, including Seaport Village. It really didn't get much better. As far as the room, it was comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was clean and contemporary as well.

Parking is expensive via valet but then again I felt better (after seeing some of the street \"characters\") that my car was not in a public parking lot. Valet attendants are friendly and helpful. They retrieved my car once for me when I forgot one of my bags and coat. The parking is not on site; so I appreciate the extra effort. Check-in was a breeze, friendly while efficient. The room while modern is sparse with high ceilings and wood floors. Minimal decor, small television for those who wish to watch some tv to relax. The beds are comfortable, I found the pillows to be on the hard side. The bathroom is modern but you will have to fuss with the knob for the shower to get them temperature right. It is not an easy one way hot, the other way cold or progressive hot to cold. The mini bar is expensive (the usual) but I did not find any vending machines. No ice bucket for the room. BYOB of soda or what not for the small fridge! You can hear the hummm of city traffic below; I turned on the AC fan and it seemed to help drown out some of the noise. My room was on the 9th floor. Finally the front entrance zen fortress style door is rather funny. It does not add much to the ambiance of the hotel but rather is a pain in the rear to move to get in or out of the hotel. I would not stay here again. For me; it was an okay experience for the deal I received. If I had payed full price; I would be a little more picky and probably disappointed. *****if you join the Kimpton in touch program but book through a third party you will not receive points or rewards.

First, let's talk location. Yes, it's in the Gaslamp District, which is how it is advertised. However, it is in the LAST block of the Gaslamp, about 9-12 blocks removed from the water and on the very northern end. It is also right next to a free trolley station and bus stop - both of which attract riff-raff and ne'er-do-wells. You know the scene - Everything $1 stores nearby, a Check Cashing joint across the street, etc.... Not exactly a place you'd feel comfortable walking around for a few blocks until you reached a more reputable part of the Gaslamp area. To put it in perspective, the Rite Aid across the street had 2 armed guards in the store when I shopped there to get a bottle of water at about 10:00 PM on night. Note also that I was approached 3x during my walk across the street that night - twice for \"extra change\" and once by a vagabond who wanted to \"borrow my cell phone\" for a minute. Yeah, right. Next, let's talk quality. Upon arriving to my room, I noted that 2 light bulbs were out, 1 of the lamps had holes in the shade, and on 2 other lamps, the shades were broken and just hung on the lamps at random angles. The air conditioning did not cool to the desired temperature and the hot water fluctuated in temperature during my showers. I was going to bring these matters to the attention of the front desk worker, but when the person in front of me at the desk mentioned that he had NO hot water and the receptionist asked him if he knew how to work the faucet, I figured that my complaint would likely not be addressed adequately either, so I didn't bother. Third, let's talk value. Yes, the hotel has good free coffee in the AM and a free wine reception every evening, some with free live music. However, $36/night to park a car is a bit steep. Fiinally, let's talk attitude. This hotel fancies itself to be a \"chic\", \"trendy\" hotel. Their staff are all fit and young and wearing the required black, slate and gold outfits, with the men wearing trendy hats and women giving a good appearance. However, they also come across as snooty and better-than-thou at times, despite the fact that your (and my) room charges are paying their salaries. While not put-offish to a great extent, I never really felt as if they were genuine to me or to any of the other patrons I overhead them interacting with. Superficially nice, yes, but genuine, no. There are many other hotels in the Gaslamp area, many that are much nicer, although perhaps more pricey, than this one. They are more centrally located, better lit, in safer areas and have more amenities. I'd strongly suggest that any traveler fully evaluate other options while also considering this hotel so that you make the right cost/quality trade-off. For me, while I got a good price through a travel site that allows you to get good deals on lodging, I would surely have paid more for a higher quality place with lamps that work, people who are friendly and a safer environment where I would not get accosted by bums every time I walked out the door.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, California", "Title": "\u201cPalomarginal\u201d", "Author": "blissfork", "ReviewID": "UR123673091", "Content": "Maybe marginal is not the right word.

I stayed there for two nights with my boyfriend and the whole time we thought, \"Dang. We wish we had booked at Palomar's beachier themed sister, Solamar\". For me, Palomar is like that girl in the club who tries a bit too hard. She has one too many accessories on, a bit too much eyeliner, and you know by the end of the night she's going to be DYING to take off those stilettos. Solamar is more like your super cool friend who is always going on fun adventures and wants to take you with. Palomar has upscale styling, but it ends up looking like the upscale styling of every other upscale hotel. Solamar has a fresher approach to design, including very funky mirrors in the guest rooms. To me, Solamar feels effortless, approachable, and soothing. Palomar is very nice, but just not my speed. Note 1: The pool wasn't open while I was there (or at least I couldn't find a way to unlock the door to it). That was a bummer, because I love going out on Solamar's pool deck in the early morning and curling up with a good book as the sun climbs. Note 2: The guest rooms have fab wooden floors, which help alleviate my bed bug paranoia, but their heavy wood beds scratch the floors to pieces. Note 3: I do LOVE Palomar's rolling ottomans. I rolled back and forth all over the room in a frenzy just for fun. They roll REALLY quickly and the rooms have somewhat of a corridor inside that's a perfect rolling tract. I think a lot of travelers will prefer Palomar over Solamar, but if you're a more laid back beachier type of person with an eye for funkier design I suggest trying Solamar.

It was a beautiful weather, as always in SoCal, so a walk to the Marina Park was a perfect way to stretch the legs (great recommendation by the staff).

( I stay in about 10 hotels a month ) but after reading \"The Vegas Show Guy's \" inaccurate review of The Palomar, I had to give my two cents! First some History on my stays- I originally found this place through a Hotwire purchase. It was \"Hotel Se\" at the time. I got in late and expected the typical treatment of how most hotels tend to treat Hotwire/Priceline guests ( Hotels tend to give those customers the least desirable rooms, by elevators, small or whatever ) well I was met by the Concierge and this night, he upgraded me to the most amazing room I have stayed in, in a long time. I was just your average guest, nothing special. When I left I felt like I had stayed at the Ritz and was addicted to this hotel. Upon my next visit, I learned the hotel had changed to a Kimpton property, my friendly Concierge had moved on, but I was met by a beaming front desk clerk named Nicole. Needless to say, Palomar had retained its great service in the transition. The restaurant was closed for renovation on this visit but I was excited to see it was going to be a upscale yet casual place that I would look forward to on my next visit. 3rd visit- ( Now a Palomar addict ) Nicole once again was at the desk, and this time Johnson came out to greet me and introduced himself as the Assistant Office ( front desk ) manager. He gave me his card and said if I needed anything to please contact him. Once again a PERFECT experience. ( Oh and this time the new addition to the staff was Kona the Goldfish! He does exist ) The Valet's at the Palomar are amazing- One night I got in late and had forgotten to remove my do not disturb sign on my room so housekeeping did not clean my room. I let him know at 10pm and he took care of it! By the time I was done with dinner and back in my room it was clean. And yes it is TRUE that the Valet gives you a card upon arrival with your car and lets you know to text when you need the car. It works and I loved the convenience! They are very clear about this policy so I do not know why Vegas guy would write that. Now let's talk about the SALTBOX- Love Love Love Erin! Full of life and a bevy of information. She makes one mean Martini! All of the staff in the bar have been amazing and as a Biz traveler I usually like to go somewhere other then the hotel to eat. Especially in the Gas Lamp. But you know what? I would not go anywhere else. The Sliders? - YUM, my favorite? The Lemon/Butter popcorn! ( Seriously ) Unfortunately I will not always be able to afford the Palomar, ( Our company has $$ Limitations ) but when I can, I will pick this first. It will be easy for some of you to think I work for this property, I assure you I do not. Feel free to contact me with your comments if you like. Hope all of you who get the chance to go to this property, enjoy it as much as I do. ( If you can afford it, you MUST book the Suites with the balcony and kitchen. You WILL NOT be disappointed! ( Final Note- This is kind of a hip trendy place. I am not sure it is the type of place that would appeal to the Senior set. If you are a Marriott Courtyard kind of person, or need a beach resort type place, this may not be for you! But if you like a lively nightlife, beautiful city views and GREAT GREAT SERVICE then you will be right at home at Palomar!)", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cSomething Fishy going on...\u201d", "Author": "VegasShowGuy", "ReviewID": "UR122544419", "Content": "The reviews seem to be loaded with items as if an advertisement by the hotel. E.g. Comments that guests asked for a fish, Kona, in their room ( dont seem that mentioned anywhere on site or by staff). Reviews mention texting valet to get car. Again, we were never advised of such conveniences. Unfortunately our experiences were negative aside from the Saltbox restaurant ( in separate review), which we enjoyed immensely. Just stayed in 2 rooms for 3 nights ( 1 senior, 3 adults, 2 kids = 6 people ). Booked it through Expedia on their \"unpublished hotel\" facility. Not a good idea. For us at least. This is the old Hotwire Co they acquired. You choose a general area and grade of hotel, pay upfront and then get advised of hotel you will stay at. So, we chose downtown san diego, 4.5 star. What could go wrong with a 4.5 star hotel in San Diego? For approx $170 p.night p.room with taxes. Not the cheapest, but, wow it was going to be 4.5 star. Then the fun started... We were advised via email that the hotel was the kimpton in gaslamp quarter. Having lived in San Francisco and stayed at kimptons there, we were happy as they have a good reputation there. As a safeguard, Immediately after I booked with expedia, I called the property directly to request that the rooms we purchased have 2 beds each as we were a party of 6. Hotel advised that they do not allow any requests for bookings coming from expedia/hotwire as the room rate they get is so low that we get \"run of house\" or whats left basically and that the room rate was less than an employee rate. ( not my problem - sorry - kimptons business decision ). So from the get go, it felt like were second rate citizens. It turns out that Kimpton only acquired this property, formerly Ce ce) approx 3 months ago and was desperately trying to fill rooms at any cost and ignoring the star rating. So, I asked was the hotel full or what the likelihood of getting rooms with 2 beds would be. They said they had 3 rooms with 2 beds left and that to guarantee we get them, we could upgrade for $20 per room per night. I was reluctant as I now felt like I'd been taken. I asked how they expected 6 people to sleep in 2 beds. Answer: the rooms are fire coded for 4 people irrespective of number of beds. Not the answer I was looking for. The conversation was clearly going nowhere. Not 4.5 star service. No other suggestions. I said I'd call expedia and get back. Called expedia. Spoke with phillipino person who spent forever looking up \"terms of conditions\" of my purchase. Said she would refer to supervisor. Got cut off. I called back. Spoke to another agent, who said the notes in the booking said, \" no guarantees of bed arrangement and that was it '. I then suggested they call hotel to request rooms with 2 beds on our behalf as they should have more \"clout\" or to change us to another 4.5 star hotel in the San Diego area. They used the standard, empathize and restate guidelines and said, \" I'm sorry sir, I do understand sir, but we cannot call hotel and we cannot change the hotel\". I stated that I could call my credit card company and cancel the transaction for misrepresentation, then, I would be happy to book with expedia again in a property that would guarantee 2 beds in each room ( not too much to ask is it? ). I was told I couldn't do that per their terms. Solution came when a manager got on the line and advised to go ahead and pay the upgrade to hotel and fax receipt to expedia for a refund. I haven't done that yet. The property its self seems like its in flux. Several different staff inconsistences. I felt sorry for the front desk girls. There is a need for consistent training. Eg. Called hotel phone. \"Do you have towels we can take to beach?\" . \"Yes you can take the green towels from the pool\". Went to pool. No staff. No towels. went to front desk. \"Where are beach towels please\"?. Answer. \"Sorry you cant take towels to beach\". \"Oh, I just spoke with housekeeping on phone and they advise it was ok. I went to pool and couldnt see anybody or any towels. None on view anywhere.\". \"Oh, ok, that was probably the manager who was trying to be nice and helpful\". gal said. \". \"Great, so where are they?\". There are purple towels at the back around the corner of the pool\". I went. Low and behold. WHITE TOWELS (just like ones in room). Oy Vey. This was to get a towels. No fridges. (Locked minibars only). Nice wood panel floors, but heavy , deep, scratches by side table and bed. No coffee makers. Weak chocolate and coffee in lobby in am. Parking is valet only. $36 per day. (thats pricey). Valet guy was helpful with directions. No real views to speak of. Parking garage (rm 604). Back of house, vents, etc(rm901). Errors on bill. Got charged for 2 cars, 3 nights. Only used valet 1 night with 1 car. Bed sheets were clean and comfy, however, beds were small ( double beds ). ok for 1 person only. Rooms somewhat clean. \"Dust/Fluff bunnies\" in room on floor. Shampoo and conditioner seemed poor quality. No lotion. \"Free\" in room wifi required providing email and info for their mailing list. Location on fringe of great gaslamp quarter and uglier area with \"street people\". Intimidating for kids. Overall. Better choices available. Dont recommend using \"hotwire\" method of buying high rated room and finding out later where you get. Not really a family hotel. Restaurant, Saltbox. Very Good. As we checked in, another customer with a family, was asking for a room with 2 beds as he had booked with hotwire/expedia and received room with 1 bed. Front desk couldnt help and offered him more blankets for family to sleep on floor. I'm pleased I called ahead and paid \"upgrade\" for 2 beds. Now all I have to do is see if expedia will refund upgrade fee they promised to. The city of San diego is overall very interesting, diverse, great climate and has alot to offer.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cPerfection for a weary traveler\u201d", "Author": "Paul B", "ReviewID": "UR122532759", "Content": "This was my first visit to a Kimpton property, it was based on a referral from a good friend that travels as extensively as I do.

The room included a large flat screen TV and what I considered very fast WiFi connection. There was a safe in the room that is designed to store a laptop computer securely. Inside the room was quiet but you could hear some sounds coming from the rooms when walking to the elevators. The Wine tasting Happy Hour is an excellent touch for business travelers, it provides a very nice social environment to meet others that are also visiting the area. The staff from the Palomar looks to enjoy these social hours as much as the guest which is nice to encounter. My only negative about the property is the design of the showers. Its simply not possible to shower without splattering water all over the marble floor when showering due to the rainfall shower head and half wall of the shower enclosure.

Parking must be expensive in that area of San Diego. They charge $36 for valet parking, but there's a garage across the street that's still $28. You actually might as well go with the valet even though that price sounds ludicrous. They give you a number you can text when you want to get your car so it'll be waiting for you.

I would also avoid staying on the fourth floor if you want to rest. The tv & iron in our room didn't work so we had to call engineering to fix it. Besides that, our overall stay was pleasant.

I can say without hesitation that every contact I had with hotel staff was superb. Valet, bellstaff, front-desk, wait staff, all great. You should also know that I am a regular guest at the Solamar, the other San Diego Kimpton. As an inner circle member I always hope, but never expect that I will be upgraded. This time I received a wonderful upgrade to a Flat on the 19th floor. I had 1,000 square feet just for me. I\u2019ve never stayed in a Kimpton with a full-kitchen, dishwasher included (not that I was going to use it). It had a nice living/kitchen area, a large dining room table, a bedroom with a large walk in closet and 1.5 baths. Did I mention the balcony with the beautiful view of Downtown San Diego\u2026. At the risk of sounding ungrateful, there are a few things that need to fine-tuned at the Palomar. -Housekeeping of my particular room. The carpet in the living room was stained, really stained. It needs to be shampooed and soon. In addition, the previous guest left several items of trash in the drawers of the walk-in closet. From the receipts that were left behind and the boxes, it must have been a really wild time. When as a guest you find these things, it makes you wonder\u2026what else isn\u2019t clean. -The bathroom. There are absolutely no, we\u2019re talking zero towel racks/hooks. Strange for a hotel chain that prides itself on reduce/reuse. -Window coverings/drapes. There are zero blinds/drapes/window coverings in the living room/kitchen/dining area which is fine. Just be mindful that you are in full-public view. The window coverings in the bedroom are poor. If you are bothered by light, you will be very unhappy. I travel with a sleep-mask and earplugs, so I was fine.

Also, we love to travel with our two Jack Russell terriers, and since Kimpton Hotels are pet friendly, we were able to make it a \"family\" vacation.

What we wanted from a hotel in San Diego was a hotel with a roof pool, in the Gaslamp district. The flights for UK leave San Diego late in the evening, so we thought we could have a day chilling out by the pool, before leaving in the evening to catch our flight. Prior to leaving UK we decided that we were going to stay in the Hotel Solamar (bear with me here!), and I was supposed to book it after checking with my wife it was the hotel we wanted. A couple of days before leaving I realized I had forgotten to book it, and the price had jumped by about 30% - so I decided to leave it and gamble we would find somewhere either when we arrived, and I would keep an eye on websites for deals. About a week before we arrived I checked Expedia and found the Solamar hotel, for the original price we had been looking at. At least I thought I had! I had actually booked the Palomar. After some e-mail checking to ensure we had booked the correct hotel (there is also a Palomar in San Fran I believe) we arrived at the Palomar. First thing we found was there was no car park. I'm not a fan of valet parking, as I am more than capable of parking a car, however the guys were very helpful with the parking, and gave me directions to the car park they use, and I managed to get 2 nights and 3 days (Thurs, Fri and Sat) for $30 pre paid - multiple entry. Check-in was very pleasant, and we were well looked after. The room was large, well decorated, free wi-fi, and clean. Looked like it had recently been decorated. The whole hotel was very, very nice, and in a great location for Gaslamp district. 2nd Kimpton on our trip, and very impressed. Knowing we would be checking out at lunchtime and sitting round the pool all day, we asked about access to somewhere to shower before we left and were told they would check with the Spa to see if we could use this, when we came to check out. On the Friday afternoon we went and sat by the pool, had a couple of drinks and relaxed. Perfect for what we wanted the following day. Unfortunately what we had not accounted for was that Saturday is obviously posing day by the pool. Lots of drunk, loud showy off people. Not the hotels fault - it was just the clientele that were there that day. So not as relaxing as we hoped, and only a small part of the pool area was in the Sun so we had to fight for a spot. Pool is nice though, and bar staff very welcoming. When we came to leave we were given access to the Spa to take a shower before we left. All in all I would probably give this place a 4.5 if there was a rating, but due to the staff helpfulness there (Valet guys giving their information for car park, and Nicole on reception for all of her assistance with Spa access, and other stupid questions I had!) - I will push the rating to a 5.

The check in was seamless and we were offered an upgrade to a suite for $100 more. The 4th floor, apparently, is the pool floor, which is also where Siren club is located. We decided against it and stuck with our 4th floor room. The hotel did mention the 4th floor was noisy. Small room, but wasn't half-bad. The shower, like previous reviews, was not well thought out. Water all over the floor and you'd better be with someone who does not mind seeing you in the buff. The water on the floor did not bother me it is what it is. Room service menu is limited and we did not try it out. We did try calling around 1am for the limited overnight menu, but were told it's no longer available. Bummer. The bed was comfortable, but squeaky. Two of the light fixtures were unplugged, and our room was missing it's smoke detector. Simple oversight? No turndown service, either. Bummer x2 The noise from the club did not bother us. It's our belief that if you get your room via hotwire or any other discount website, you're placed on the 4th floor or anywhere near the pool. They're undesirable rooms, because anyone in their right mind would be bothered by the loud thumping and cussing and yelling from it's drunken patrons.

He sits at a desk in the lobby, the mail man drops the mail on his desk, and he has a presence about him that adds to the Se. He's got an arrogant haughty type attitude, which fits this hotel perfectly. That's not a knock, however. It's a compliment and I'd welcome a chance to have wine with him during their free wine tasting on Friday. I'd come back if I got a good deal.

The hotel is very chic & trendy. Our room was very nice & spacious. The view wasn't the greatest, but that is what happens when you are staying in a big city. On the weekends they have a nightclub near the pool, if you stay on this side of the hotel you will hear the music until 2am or so. The hotel was within walking distance of many places to eat & drink, but if you want to go closer to the water you will need to take a taxi or the trolly. We used the trolly everyday & it was cheap & easy. I didn't think the hotel was in a great location, I didn't feel 100% safe walking in the area, plus there was a shooting near our hotel during our stay... this was rare according to everyone, but it still made us uncomfortable. Also, upon checking in they were unable to find our reservation & were going to turn us away. Thankfully, I had saved the reservation in my email & was able to show documentation. It was somewhat discouraging that they were not going to do anything for us when they couldn't find our reservation. They did end up upgrading our room, but I am not sure it was worth it. If you are looking to party, this is probably the hotel for you. If you ar e looking for more sightseeing, quiet dinners and closer to the water I would suggest staying somewhere else.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coon Rapids, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cMy husband and I enjoyed the room, spa and room service!\u201d", "Author": "BekahH", "ReviewID": "UR115684177", "Content": "We wanted comfort, nice things, a chance to get away from it all.... and we found that at Se San Diego.

However, the experience following was absolutely miserable! The first night we were treated terribly in the hotel bar, where the bartender seemed more interested in getting off of work than treating the customers with care. He was extremely rude. The following night over shadowed the previous with flying colors. We returned to our room after an entire day out in San diego only to find a room that had not been cleaned. Upon calling the front desk, the \"manager\" accused me of having left the do not disturb sign on the door. His only offer was to send up 2 fresh towels and expected me to be satisfied by that. After spending $200 a night, and $36 on parking alone... I was livid. I would advise against this hotel to any friend or family member for many reasons, but primarily because of the extreme disrespect I felt from the staff.

There is a pool party on weekends, and I saw a lot of people having a good time, but did not participate. Pool and surrounding area is beautiful.
