In Venice everything is more expensive than the rest of Italy anyway, and I wanted to ensure we chose a good place rather than a price-based room. Having said that, this is nowhere close to being a four star hotel - go elsewhere. Reasons are: - The rooms are older and less comfortable than they appear - The bathrooms were old and shower head was dirty from lack of cleaning. In addition, it was set on some sort of high pressure wash that actually stung... when you turned the nozzle to change the flow it made no difference. You had to bear through it - There was a TV in the room, but it wasn't plugged in and since there was no power outlet nearby, and no power strip to bring power to it, I'm not sure it had any functionality whatsoever... at least TRY to make it look like you care. - Customer Service was poor all around. Of the four people at the desk only one smiled when you came up and asked a question. Most acted bored of the 'silly tourist questions' like 'What's the easiest way to get to the airport?' - My wife is pregnant and was feeling tired so we decided to take it easy the day we were to leave. We asked if they had a late checkout option (which ALL 4-star hotels have... that's why you choose them) and they said no, that we had to get out by noon because they were booked up and needed the room. I even understand this, but it wasn't in a nice, customer service way... they were unhappy with us even asking the question and made that clear. - We asked for the tour options they had in the brochure sitting at their front desk and they told us to walk out and upto the local spots (different for every tour) and negotiate for ourselves... no desire to pick up the phone and help us out.

First, the room we had was very small and the bathroom was even smaller. This room was given to us when I refused to go into the first, really tiny room that was offered to us. Since I am traveling with my teenaged son, the desk clerk got annoyed because the room she was offering me had two beds. To call them beds would be charitible -- they were more like cots, and with our luggage, we would not have been able to turn around. The second room was marginally better, but still extremely small. But the worst part of the experience was the breakfast. It was as if the hotel were suprised that people wanted breakfast -- there were neither enough tables nor dishes nor cups nor silverware to go around. There was one poor woman frantically trying to clear the tables while guests were eating cereal out of coffee cups, coffee out of juice glasses and buttering rolls with the handles of forks. It was purely amateur hour from the get go. The final indignity was the arrangements that the hotel made for us to get to the train station. We paid 80 euros for a private taxi to get us there on time, but no one bothered to mention that our train was not actually leaving from this station and that we had to travel to another station to catch our train. We barely made it with less than a minute to spare -- and these were non-refundable tickets. I had shown the tickets to the clerk who made our arrangements, and he never mentioned the fact that we had to go to a different train station. And don't even get me started about the internet issues and how unpleasant the clerk was who was supposed to be helping us. Here's the thing -- don't go into the hospitality business unless you really want to help travelers, something that didn't happen at this hotel. A small, uncomfortable room, bad service, a terrible breakfast situation -- why would you want to stay here?", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Shores, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly pleasant Hotel, very nice!!\u201d", "Author": "humbert65", "ReviewID": "UR30480693", "Content": "Great location, very clean and pleasant hotel.

To cross it, I had to take off shoes, the water was as high as 15sm and it was around 10-15 degrees Centigrade. Very romantic beginning. The hotel looks nice, 4-star, but the rooms are tiny. I saw a single for 280 euros per night, and a bigger double for 450 euros per night. Ridiculous prices for this cells. My room had a tiny bathroom without a bathtub, the shower directly on the same floor, no shower tub. A tiny wardrobe. Very simple breakfast included. In the morning I woke up because of the noise, I thought it was raining, the windows were open. jaja, it was a shower in the next room. They also say the trip to Murano is included - it\u00c2\u00b4s a scum. The trip is paid by the factory held by Signoretti family and includes only a show in the factory of one tired guy who is blowing stupid horses in front of the public, and a quite big showroom with fine pieces of glass. The price of this glass includes the water taxi, the guide in Venice, the guide in Murano, a salesperson speaking several languages, and a commission to the hotel. Also if you ask about a restaurant, they would always recommend you one that pays them a commission, which does not mean it\u00c2\u00b4s a bad restaurant, but pricey.

At first we gave no thought to the inter-connecting door in the corner, until 3 noisy adults moved in that night, and we realised we had been given half of a suite.
