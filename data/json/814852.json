What a disappointment, why did I do that ? I paid 100 EUR more and got far less than what I had. There is not a single positive point for W Hotel from an end to end experience perspective ! (As said in another comment, why on earth Le Meridien is SPG 5 and W Hotel is SPG 6, I just can't understand. This should definitely be the reverse) The global \"cool trendy chic\" marketing positionning of the W hotels is fine, even if prices are high, as long as the whole customer experience is well managed and details are not forgotten. This is the least you can expect she paying 300+ EUR a room. And this is their weakness : they are just not at the level they pretend to be. Few bullet points : - Dark rooms - Poor amenities (very strict minimum with shampoo/showergel/conditionner for such a category, I never saw that anywhere else), - Furnitures not well maintained - POOR breakfast and POOR service (I mean, I can compare with where I was the day before in Instanbul, it is literally day and night) - No complimentary water in standard room (this is a joke, come on. At this price per night, not putting a 50 cts bottle of water is just a shame) - \"Whatener whenever\" concept does not worth it if you have to call back 60 min after ordering a meal in your room (supposed to be there at max 30 min after ordering) and you're being told that you have to wait an additional 15 min. OK, I finally did not pay for it. -...oh, and always surprised to see that, at check out, nobody is even asking you how was your stay. They don't understand anything in their business and just benefiting from the power of their brand. Disappointing!

It's much better to take the Spectacular room or the Fabulous room. The Mega room is bigger, but is at the end of a very very long hall. So every time you go to your room you really walk a long time and the most annoying, the staff elevator is just there, so from 7am there is a lot of noise of clapping doors and elevators and stuff being brought back and forth. And although being one of the more expensive rooms, I definitely would prefer the one with the terrace. I did like the lighting! it was a bit complicated to control, but once you got it...nice. The bed is very good as most SPG hotels. I was a bit amazed that even a Mega Room didn't have a bath. there is room for it, I get it that in standard rooms you only put a shower, but here? That would be a must for me. It is a bit strange to come in the door into your bathroom, but I an can see the smile on the interior designer's face when he pitched that idea to the client. It's a novelty, yes, but good \"people centered\" design...no! Service...yes service is a special thing. Either you have it, or you don't. They don't know yet. Our Airco was broken and I went at least 4 times to the front desk to ask to repair it...no such luck. it was either ice cold or hot warm whenever we came back from outside. When I mentioned that at checkout, first the guy on duty didn't say much, except for a smudge. But the duty manager stepped in, asked what was the problem, and gave me his card that next time I would come I should let him know, and he would provide free upgrade to compensate. I also told him about the noise, and he was sympathetic about it. But overall the staff is just not service orientated. For me that is a deeper problem that most of the time lies within the management of the hotel. If they don't install or nurture a philosophy of service mentality, then it will not come by itself.

My overall experience was very disapointing and I would recommend any regular W hotel goer, NOT TO GO to the W Istanbul. Besides its very good location, the overall service standard is very poor: - I had a problem with my booking which didn't work and I had to stay my first night in another Starwood hotel. The concierge didn't care, showed no empathy, offered no alternative option. He basically didn't do anything to help. He let me seat in the lobby without offering me any refreshment or service eventhough I was obviously coming a long way and tired. - You meet staffs in corridor throughout the hotel, you never get a hello, never receive a smile, basically you don't feel welcomed at all. - I went to the \"spa\" for a massage. The \"spa\" is this dark, old room, with damaged paint and minimum facility, no changing room, no shower....basically a gloomy closet. - When you ask for direction in the hotel (the hotel is a maze), no staff ever knew what i was looking for was. The staffs have no idea of where amenities are located in the building. - The so-called \"Whenever, Whatever\" was a joke. I asked for the host to get me some tickets for an event in town, he basically told me where i could go and buy those tickets and ignored me. Wasn't he the one supposed to go above and beyond and get those tickets himself, or send someone? I would have paid for that service. - I paid for a suite which i thought would be a nice upgrade vs a traditional single king room. The room was dark as the building is a lowrise and there is no real bathroom! The bathroom basically is in your entry, in separate elements, which gives you no sense of privacy or cozyness whatsoever.

There is a nice grocery store about a block away, as well as a laundry place about another block up the same street (walk outside the hotel, go hard left, both will be on your right). I found the service a bit cool compared to the Westins and Le Meridiens I usually stay at, and even some Ws. The room we had was also a bit strange, as others have noted, with the shower and toilet directly off the room. It's hard to describe and I had never seen anything like it. Not terrible, but different. I would probably give my experience a 3+ if that existed; it was better than good, but overall not great. So let's call it Almost Very Good. I would stay here again, although now that there is a Le Meridien open in Istanbul, I would probably try that first. If you are a W fan, however, give this one a shot.

In fact, I stayed in a different W the following evenings in a different city and had a great experience. However, I found the Istanbul to be very trendy, but not particularly warm or comfortable. The staff was difficult to approach, solemn, and did not welcome my questions with a 'warmth' or genuine concern. They automatically add a Unicef $1 donation to your bill at check-out without addressing it, which I found shady - I would be happy to donate $1, but ask me before you add it to my bill. The elevator would park on my floor, which would mean I would hear the song it was playing... at 4am nightly... and it was quite loud. The breakfast buffet is good, but 60TL and there was an unwillingness to make the custom items such as omelettes and french toast, which are overtly advertised as you walk in. Decent gym in a small space. All in all... a trendy hotel where if you feel cool by staying at a W, it might meet this expectation.

Hence there were 4 or 5 preset lighting options you can choose from, however none of them were good enough for me to shave or for my wife to for makeup. To create a romantic athmosphere I can understand little usage of light but I'd be happy by having an option for a well illuminated room. We had a breakfast on Sunday and it wasn't any special for me, lower than my expectations from W Hotel. And the price for the breakfast was 60 TL which is pretty highy, considering it will take only 5-10mins to reach Ortakoy where different choices such as House Cafe or Kitchenette can offer better breakfast for the same amount or lower. It is very hip place to stay and especially if you are coming from abroad, it is close to many attaractions (Dolmabahce Palace is across the road, Ciragan Palace, Ortakoy, Bebek and even historical peninsula is not far away).

The bathroom is spacious and well equipped. The rest of the room so-so. Hiding the TV behind smoked glass may be a nice design gag, but of course the picture quality suffers. Smallish desk with a chair that had a mind of its own, one lounger and not much room around. Functional. Not more. The bed was very nice, firm with good pillows. An iPhone dock along with a Bose wave radio completely fulfill my expectations. Good internet speed at 30tl (12 Euro) per day but the minibar is outrageously priced. Beware of deafening noise from the hotel's bar on Thursday nights - the closer you are (lower numbers) to the bar, the worse it gets.I could actually feel the bass in bed. I did try the restaurant for lunch, no complaints, but the real action starts a few feet away from the hotel in bustling Besiktas. Take a walk, out the door turn left, then next right, and there are bustling streets and an abundance of little restaurants beckons within sight of the fish market. Breakfast at 60 TL (25 Euro) was a let-down. Getting the staff to bring a cup of coffee is not easy, and two eggs on toast, sunny side up, arrived as two rock hard eggs which had been sitting in a chafer for what must have been hours. No toast, either. A request for two freshly made eggs resulted in a discussion with the waitress - but did ultimately reap the desired dish. Still without toast. Multiple request for butter or margarine yielded no result. Would I return? I guess not. The novelty wears off fast and the shortcomings by far outweigh the hipness factor.

Really?! 3. Light switches are in stupid places, like behind doors or next to the bed. I shouldn't have to cross the room to turn on overhead lights when I first come in the door. 4. The bathroom lights are horrible for doing makeup or shaving. 5. The shower also required a call to the front desk. 6. The cold water in the sink came out piping hot. After they came to fix it, it still came out hot and we were told to \"let it run for 5 or 10 minutes until it comes out cold\". Really?! This is in a country where water is in limited supply?! 7. The baby crib that was brought up for us was a cheap plastic folding thingie with no crib mattress. Our baby was miserable the whole trip until we finally figured out the problem and had her nap on the king bed the last day. 8. The restaurant features a breakfast buffet for 60 Turkish Lira per person, not included in room rate. Way too expensive. 9. We ordered off the (slightly) cheaper menu and found the food average at best, but with tiny, wannabe gourmet servings. 10. Service was slow, whether we were alone in the restaurant or among many other customers. 11. We asked for a high chair for our baby. While we waited, they took our drink orders. While my wife was standing around bouncing the baby, waiting for 10 minutes for the high chair, the staff wandered around the room and then brought us our drinks. And asked if we were ready to order. Still no baby seat! Really?! 12. Our final morning, we ordered the pancakes after overhearing another guest rave about them. One serving consists of two (2) coaster-size pancakes that tasted average at best, with two (2) sliced strawberries and half a banana, sliced. Plus a tablespoon of maple syrup. So chic, so modern, so gourmet. So average and overpriced, it was even more annoying that they didn't bring my wife her syrup and I didn't have enough for both of us. Then it took 15 minutes before I could flag a waiter down to bring her some. Really?! 13. I sipped coffee one morning in the downstairs lounge. The chairs are very modern, but totally uncomfortable, which pretty much encapsulates our whole experience with the hotel. I'll be honest. We had a great time in Istanbul and I love Turkish people (partly because they were effusively affectionate toward my baby). The sights were great. The location of the hotel is a bit out the way for the major downtown historic sites, but it wasn't difficult getting around on public transportation. But the W Istanbul was a major downer.

The room was excellent - large, heavenly bed, a daybed against one of the large windows, a nice TV and a great bathroom area with two sinks, shower and the toilet. There was no bathtub which is fine with me, as I do not like wallowing in my own filth, to quote Kramer. Service from the get go was excellent but it could have been exceptional if they had done one more thing - one of our taxi drivers was trying to gyp us for a ridiculous amount (TL35 from Sultanahmet) and we knew it could not be more than TL15. The hotel guy came, looked at us, looked at the driver and then left us to our own devices. Ideally, I would like them to treat us as one of their own and protect us from these a##hole taxi drivers.

The floorplan is unique, to say the least; and the rooms are not what you will see anywhere else in a W-chain hotel. I didn't particularly care for some features of my room, such as the dark purple colors and black velvet decor, but I like experiencing different styles and this style was a mix between post-modern and ecclectic and \"man, I think someone slipped LSD into my drink\". The lighting was very poor in the bathroom and not great anywhere in the room, but the shower - - like many Turkish showers - - was massive and awesome. It was not a Turkish hammam (Turkish bath), but the size was similar to some small hammans. It's the type of room where it will take you 15 minutes to figure out how to operate the electrically-operated blinds, recessesed lighting, etc. I would not recommend a long stay here, but for one of two nights, it was cool. My hypothesis is that the hotel and room designers tried too hard on this one to be \"modern\", or were smoking some excellent Turkish Red Afghani while making some of the final design choices. The end-result is not my taste, but I do appreciate the effort to escape the mundane and be different. I'm not entirely sure I would go back to the W Istanbul, but don't regret staying; sort of a \"been there, done that\" response to this hotel. This said, I would highly recommend this hotel to any Grateful Dead music fans, because there is something about old Deadheads which would appreciate some of the faux pas design glitches in this hotel without being judgemental. The only thing missing from my room was a 1960's glow lamp and a blacklight. Thirty years ago . . . my wife would have really enjoyed getting high here, and probably would have ended up in a Turkish Prison. Thank God those days are long past! The restaurants in the hotel, like most upscale hotels, are expensive and not the value that can be had compared to what you can get elsewhere in Istanbul. This said, the small street-level restaurant had some of the best lamb I have had in Turkey, and that is saying something. The staff here here is very friendly and anxious to help. The English skills of all of the staff I spoke with were also very good, but good English is not difficult to come by in educated Turks, especially in the hospitality industry. I would rate the concierge service here as considerably above the norm in Turkey, and amongst the best I have experienced in the W-chain. The staff manning the concierge desk really knows the city in all its facets, and Istanbul is a complex city.

It is close to many of the sights and night life of Istanbul. Somehow, I have just been having a challenging stay. My first room was 232. On check in, I noticed that the room was cold and called after an hour to see what could be done heat it better. They said that the room unoccupied for a while and that they could centrally heat it faster. Even after 16 hours in the morning the room was still only 17 deg C. I probably could have slept longer, but the room was immediately beside the storage for housekeeping. After that door slammed shut for the 30th time, I just got up and showered and got ready to move. Cautionary advice: the Mega Rooms are at the end of the halls and will have this issue. Currently, I am awake to the pulsations of the hotel night club in room 304, my suite upgrade. It is a fantastic room, except that the vibrations of the club are pulsing through the floor. I probably should have just stayed in the cold room. At least, I could sleep until morning. In both cases, the noise is not something that earplugs can help. It is a vibrating of the walls, floor and bed. Cautionary advice: do not go for a low numbered room. This still leaves lots of beautiful ones available to you. I tried having a drink at the bar at Minyon. However, the staff kept reaching across my small snack, glass and iPhone to retrieve glasses, put back dirty items. So, I just gave up and went up to just chill and get ready for bed and another touring day tomorrow. Additionally, the safe in the room was not fixed during the day as promised. After we got clear that was not Mr. Morrison and that the meeting point was actually at the room not the lobby as I was told, the guys fixed every thing quickly. The other challenge with this hotel is the price to value of the additional services. The airport driver fee is 125 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac. A movie from the entertainment system 30\u00c2\u00a3. (I can not explain the different currencies). These seem out of order to the price of the room. I recently stayed at the W in Bali and New York with much better value for the extras.

The room was small but perfect, with a huge flat-screen TV, a hip shower (unfortunately I kept pulling the orange ring thinking it was the water...ha ha, it made an emergency call! Handsome young man at the door enquiring as to whether we'd slipped and fallen!Thankfully my roommate wasn't too upset by that!). Bliss cosmetics is the brand of amenities, really great to use and replaced daily. The restaurant is really good (and again, half the price of the euro at that time). Imaginative, fresh, delicious food. The various bars are charming (although the drinks are not cheap - a signature pomengranate-and-bubbles was pricey). The staff is gorgeous, reflecting the beautiful diversity of the city's population, and I had the best massage ever from Flurya (a Tartar, she proudly told me). The day spa is really pleasant. So is the concierge (although his choice of an external restaurant was less than totally satisfying...we could have eaten better in the hotel!). You definitely get the W branding experience here, from the remixed lounge music in the bars to the skullcap hat offered in your room.

Being an ardent supporter of spg properties it is important to understand the distinction between the St. Regis, Westin and W hotels, and we were prepared for the hip urban atmosphere and the lounge/club style decor that the W hotels are known for. What we did not expect was the following experience: 1. Upon arrival to the hotel from the airport, there was nobody there to greet as the entrance, my wife and I rolled our sizable luggage from the taxi to the hotel entrance before we were helped. Somewhat minor but you expect more at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac350/night 2. We were staying at the hotel for 4 nights and I called the whatver/whenever service on day 1 requesting Continuous online access from my room for the duration of my stay, without having to select a daily login. I was informed that the \"IT\" manager was not around but would get back to me the following morning. We never received a follow up on this issue or call back. 3. Being in a deluxe room on the Top floor (4th floor) we had a skylight over the foot of our bed that was a nice touch however it brought in direct sunlight to the room very early in the morning. The sunlight had a shade that was dysfunctional and required multiple phone calls and finally duct tape to keep closed. Taping it shut seemed like a ugly short term solution. 4. Our pillowcases were stained and had tears in the fabric, holes to be precise, the bed and quality of linen is outstanding but dirty pillowcases unfortunately overshadows the positives in comfort and relaxation. 5. One morning we were outside and looking for help from the bell hop to flag us a taxi, after not being attended to for 10 minutes we were getting frustrated, finally we were acknowledged only to find that the next cab was given to 2 young women that arrived after us. At this point my wife proceeded to tell the individual that we were ahead of the party that just got into the cab. The bell hop got confrontational with my wife and she went back inside to speak with reception about the issue. Although the oversight could have just been human error on anybody's part, the lack of ownership and indignation on the part of the bell hop had us just walk down the street and hail our own taxi. The person at reception was apologetic and proceeded to speak to the bell hop in turkish to get his perspective. An unnecessary escalation that could have been quickly resolved without the indignation and attitude. 6.

The W book with hotel information was also removed without informing the guests.

The massage from the male was poor to say the least seemed rushed and unorganized style would do legs then back then legs again instead of concentrating on one area an doing that well.

The W hotel itself is in a beautifully restored historic building, which combined with the W design makes for a great contrast. The rooms are as you would expect from a W hotel - modern, very clean and design focused, whcih is what my wife and I like. Unlike some other W hotel the rooms are generously proportioned.

So if you are on the first or second floor (that's where I was - don't know what the other floors are like), you are basically underground with no daylight - the rooms are facing back of the hill. The room itself was horrible. There was no bathroom. Instead, toilet and shower are small closet-like spaces with doors opening into the front part of the room. If you are claustrophobic, forget about taking a shower. Any hotel room, even in smaller-brand and cheaper hotels, usually has some basic things like shower cap, personal kit, etc. Not here. Even when requested, it took some time for them to understand what it was I was asking for. And of course, during the following 4 days of my stay the items were never replaced. Service. What kind of service can you expect from people who are called not with titles assuming their functional responsivilities (like 'bell boy', 'room cleaning', etc.) but instead - 'talent'. They walk around with this huge chip on their shoulders knowing that they are 'talent'. And the guests are there, of course, to appluad. Except there is absolutely nothing to applaud for. Like one of other reviewers mentioned before me, the staff is only interested in bar guests because those are the ones who spend lots of money there (W bar is one of the well-known hang-out places in Istanbul) The week before my experience with W, I stayed at Park Hyatt. This was the best hotel experience I've had in a long time. Besides absolutely gorgeous and well-equipped room, this was the place where one feels cared and provided for every minute of his/her stay.

It just took up too much of the day getting back and forth from things - it is at least a 10-15 minute walk to the trolley, and then another 15-20 minute ride to get down to the main area of Sultanahmet. The hotel is a short cab ride from Taksim (if you are adventurous enough to try something new, do take advantage of the shared cabs, called \"dolmus\" - they are set up on pre-determined routes and are much cheaper. There are a bunch that go to Taksim just around the corner from the hotel.) The neighborhood of Besitkas behind the hotel is really great to stroll through - but it is NOT a tourist area. We loved the authenticity of the neighborhood - particularly the area around the fantastic open-air fish market - but be prepared to feel out of your element. We liked our room and the hotel itself was nicely maintained and attractive, but we were a bit disappointed that the nightlife at the hotel's bars and restaurants definitely seemed to be lacking. I really expected it to be a bit more lively. Also, it was very difficult to get our hands on one of the laptops reserved for guest use (I believe there is supposed to be a 20 or 30 minute limit, but a guest took one of the two computers to their room and kept it forever - and we really had to push the front desk to track it down for us after continually checking in with them for an hour.)

I have never seen such attentive, but non intrusive staff at any hotel. There are always staff milling around to help. 2. Incredibly clean-there was always staff cleaning the hotel.

The bed-hands down one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. I spend about 200+ nights in hotels a year, so this is a big statement, but definitely one of the most comfortable beds. 4. The ambiance-the hotel is beautifully decorated, there are a lot of open spaces for sitting, lounging or hosting coleagues. The bar, restaurant and lounge are all top notch with great food, beverages and service. 5. The location-the hotel is in a great location, close to Taksim and close to tha Kabates metro station.

Was our first experience of a W Hotel, and overall was pretty satisfied- though there were a few things we were a little disgruntled with. Liked: - The location. On the nicest street in Istanbul we saw during our stay. You need a taxi to get to the historical/tourist sights, but there was always one waiting for pick up on the doorstep of the hotel. - The ambience. Cool decor, nice lighting, lounge music throughout. Great for a weekend away. Not sure how it suits to a business stay, but we liked it. - The room. Nothing spectacular but furnished tastefully enough, and the shower/wet room was great. Cool music on the Bose sound dock, or can play your own ipod through it. - The concierge. Helpful for all that we needed of them and assisted with dinner reservations and concert tickets which was appreciated. Dealings with front desk staff was generally good too. Didn't like: - The first room we were put in (424 I believe). This was at the far end of the coridoor alongside all the industrial sized heating/AC equipment. It was physically vibrating the room! No guests should have been put in this room. We were moved two doors door to a vacant room, which was fine. The front desk staff should have assigned us this room in the first case as I cant imagine anyone would accept staying in the first room. - Price of incidentals.......Seriously, we've stayed at plenty of great hotels around the world, but the mark up on the minibar items was just ridiculous. Go over the road to the supermarket to get snacks or drinks at 1/15 of the price (I am not exagerating). The breakfast buffet was similarly over-priced for what you got (50TL). We just ordered off the menu instead for something half the price. - Taxis. Not a comment directed at the W as such, but Taxi's in Istanbul were a nightmare. Felt people were ripping you off everytime, and rarely going the most direct route in instances when the meter was on. Have the door staff speak to them before you get in one I would suggest.

I had never stayed at a W before and they were due to open one in London not long after. I booked a double room through work but got to my room to find it a twin. Usually I do not mind a Twin however this room was so small it made it hard to move around the bed area. Furthermore, I really do not like it when they do not tell you they only have a twin until you get to your room and the porter who did not speak English was of no help at all. I phoned reception only to be told they did not have a spare room. Later in the evening I had another moan and of course they eventually found a room for me. There was a wardrobe, no drawers and the shower/toilet were in small cupboard like rooms off the bedroom with the sink behind two pull back doors. This is to save space, as like I mentioned, the room was tiny. The shower door was completely useless and water flooded onto my carpet next to the bed making it damp the entirety of my stay. The rude lady on the front desk was not a one off. The waiting staff in the restaurant at breakfast were rude too and completely useless. They also charged way over what we ordered and were not quick or apologetic when fixing the bill. The waitresses in the bar are even worse as they know you are not a 'big spender' and only want to get rid of you before the evening really gets busy and you are taking up valuable seating space. The bar is so loud that even when we went down to the lobby for a drink we could not really hear each other. Winding down after a long day is not an option in this hotel. The lighting in the hotel is also extremely frustrating. The corridors are long and dark, the lifts are almost pitch black too. The mood lighting next to your bed is so confusing that turning the light on in the night is a hard task. To be honest, most of the above problems I usually don't moan about too much but with a hotel like the W you tend to get more frustrated because they are trying so hard to be quirky, alternative and stylish that when they completely fail on the basics you immediately get annoyed. I'm not a big moaner when it comes to hotels but I use trip advisor so much when booking hotels that I feel I should start reviewing them too. I will rate some good hotels after this one to prove i'm not all bad!

Large, quiet, no issue with neighbour noise transferrance. The fit out of the room was very modern, cool and funky. Nice lighting panel with different options for amount of lighting. Excellent towels, better than the Kempinski. Bath robes not so good and were waffle cotton that was too thin and stuck to you if damp.

This time my overall experience was a complete disappointment and I will never stay at this hotel again! But please let me tell you the whole story. Upon my arrival at W Istanbul I was not greeted at the door and there was no one to take care of my luggage. As I was entering the hotel I saw a \" W talent\" who did not even greet me and finally after noticing thy I was struggling with my lugage offered to help me I a quite reluctant manner. Where to they find these 'talents' is a mystery to me...I approached the receptio where I was welcomed and asked if I had stayed there before - I told them that I spent 3 nights there in 2008. To my greatest surprise they could not find me in the system...The receptionist gave me the key to the room and wishe me a pleasant stay. What a 'pleasant' stay this turned out to be. I certainly do note recommend it to anybody. Unless you like 'NOISE' and don't care about 'SLEEP'. I went to bed at around 11:00 pm to me awaken one hour later by a noise coming from the next door bathroom- somebody was doing some sort of construction work.. On top of that there was extremely loud music coming from the nightclub, which I was not warned about in advance...I tried to call Gues Services an dialled 0 but to my greatest disappointment nobody answered the phone....I rang them 5 or 6 times with no result...So I had to get dressed and went down to the receptio desk to inform them about the situation. The girl at the reception was kind enough and said she was going to send somebody to Investigate the 'construction' work. I also asked her about the loud music and she told me that it was coming from the nightclub. I went to my room and the noise from The bathroom stopped for a while, unfirtuntely the music from the nightclub was getting louder and louder...So needless to say sleeping was not an option in this room. On top of that the construction work resumed at 2:45 am. Then I could not take it anymore and called reception to ask for a new room. They gave a a new room immeditely- this girl was really professional and willing to help. So I went to my new room and managed to finally fall asleep. On the next morning I called guest services to ask for a late checkout at 14:00. Was told that this was impossible, yet they let me check out at 13:00. So long story short-I left 400 EUR at this hotel and did not even managed to sleep. If somebody was willing to pay this price for a noise then this experience would have definitely been worth it. To and my story I went to the reception desk and saw the same guy who had checked me in on the day before. Naturally I informed him how noisy the room was and this W Talent said: \"Oh I forgot to tell you about the party!\" What an answer!!! This is totally unacceptable and inappropriate for a hotel chain as Starwood, unless they have decided to get rid of the W brand... To summarize I could have stayed in any of re 5 star hotels in Istanbul and I made a very bad choice, which was based on my previous experience with W. Never again...I am not asking for compensatio although if Starwood was a company who cared slightly about customer satisfaction they would have offered it. Good luck W Istanbul - I hope you will not be able to trick your guests in the future And I should have read TripArvisor inadvance, as there were previous customer who had complains about this NOISE in the past, which is an integral part of W Istanbul's ambience.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "providence, RI", "Title": "\u201cHip to be Cool\u201d", "Author": "MartyBones", "ReviewID": "UR90994555", "Content": "Trendy and modern this hotel is hip and fun.

The first impression of the hotel is that you enter to a night club. The lobby is small and the lighting very poor. Guest rooms have also issues with the lighting, especially when some of the spot lights are out of order as there were in my room. The layout of the guest room is unusual and unpractical but I suppose design has to do with the Ws idea. The sink is next to the bed, without partition and opposite the sink there are 2 doors, for the shower and the wc. In any case, I believe the biggest issue in the guest rooms is the noise. I was assigned to a room with interconnected doors. Every night, in order to sleep, we had to wear earplugs, so that we did not have to listen to next door guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conversations, corridor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and night club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noise.

We really enjoyed staying a bit outside of the touristy area. We could walk around at night without being hassled by people, which was not the case elsewhere. After taking a couple of frightening cabs to and from the old city, we decided that the light rail would be much better for our wallets and our safety. The light rail is a short walk (10 minutes or so) from the hotel. We stayed over Easter weekend, and we were surprised to find a little bag of chocolate Easter eggs tied to our door one evening. It was a very nice touch, especially considering that Easter is not a holiday in Turkey. My one complaint is with the restaurant. We had breakfast at the hotel one morning. We asked the price of the breakfast buffet, and the waiter told us (the price was not printed anywhere). When we received the bill, the price was significantly higher. The manager was not all that willing to reduce the bill to what we had been told until we threw a bit of a fit. I understand that there is a language barrier, but this is why prices should be clearly marked on the menu (a la carte prices were printed).

Here is some info that might be helpful about the hotel and the city. Room: Upgraded to king size room upon arrival as we are SPG Gold Preferred Guests. As with any W Hotel, this one was also very trendy, hip, and eclectic. Room was typical European size and had nice amenities such as Bose stereo with iPod dock, safe, balcony, etc. Separated toilet and shower was also nice. The rainfall shower head was one of the biggest I have seen and was very relaxing to take a nice shower! The only thing you will have to get use to is the dozen of so light switches. But overall, great room with comfortable bedding typically seen with Starwood properties. Service: The staff was very attentive during our whole stay and was always more than willing to help you get whatever you might need. Concierge was helpful in restaurant recommendations but it might be a good idea to let them know in advance what your price range/budget is so they can steer you in the right direction. Location: The W Istanbul is located in the \"new\" part of the city. The new part is where all the action is from a ton of cafes, restaurants, bars, lounges, shopping, etc. The old city (esp. the sultanahmet area) is full of tourists so you should do you research before you eat there as the potential for \"tourist traps\" is probably higher. The W Istanbul is in an area called Besiktas which in itself has a good local scene full of cafes, restaurants, bars, etc within walking distance. The local tram to the old city is about 1 mile away so definitely walkable. Takism and Beyoglu is about a 15 min taxi ride (could be double depending on traffic however). Tips: A few blocks up from the hotel is a liquor store if you need to get wine, beer, etc for your room. You can get a bottle of local wine for the cost of what 1 glass would cost in the hotel bar (although you pay for the trendy scene I guess). Some of the must do's are seeing all the beautiful mosques, experience the grand bazaar, visit the spice market, and take a cruise down the bosphorous! In Beyoglu, there are a ton of good seafood restaurants, esp. on Navizade street. The best durum kebab (sandwich) and lentil soup was at Durum Zade (as seen on Anthony Bourdain). All in all, we truly enjoyed our first visit to Istanbul and our stay at the W Hotel. Taking into consideration the cafes, restaurants, bars, shopping, ease of transportation to old city and experiencing the \"local scene\" we would recommend staying in the new part of Istanbul.

I was later told I had got the room at a bargain rate which I simply can't believe.( If only there had been a feeling of generosity this would have been a superb place to stay.) The room itself was really not large. Why should their airport transfer be twice as much as one organised by a superb firm over the internet? Why should it cost twice as much to take a taxi found by them than one hailed in the street? We are independent travellers who fancied a luxurious few nights in a designer hotel. That doesn't mean money was no object and we had taken leave of our senses. The concierge said on being asked about local restaurants that there was nothing round the hotel - only fast food joints.

The room had wonderful lighting and the bed linen is divine. The bathroom area is really slick. Also I have never known such effecient room service. It is not the staff's fault that the company seeks to rip you off. They are really helpful. The concierge booked us just the best table for dinner and really quickly.

I love the feel of a W. You can have the worst day ever, but when you walk into a W it almost makes you forget about your day. The W Istanbul does just that. It's a place to forget about what's going on in the world and socialize, relax, have a good meal and a few cocktails (or one too many). It's a great mix and the W Istanbul does it in modern Turkish style. It's a comfortable, yet invigorating experience not many hotels are able to achieve. If your young at heart, this is definitely the place to come. It's modern, upbeat, contemporary, chic and it makes you feel good. The service at the hotel is of W standard, truly \"Whatever, Whenever\". The concierge is one of the best I've ever dealt with... he recommended a lot of great places that match what I was looking for. It was a tailored experience. The location of the hotel is also great. It's a nice area of Istanbul, a quieter area that will soon be full of shops and cafes (there are a few already). It is a short cab ride, or walk up the hill to Taksim (about 20 mins), which is fine by me as it's crazy there. The rooms are typical W style with mood lighting, big TV's, bose waves on the nightstand, cool phones that have the weather and things like rooms service menu displayed on it and a great bed and shower. All in all it's a great experience and if you like the W style, you will truly like this one. It's not a place for people on vacation looking for the typical American hotel experience of bland rooms, decor and personality.

(We travel a LOT for vacation and business; she's Starwood Platinum -- heck, our firstborn had gold status on one airline before he turned 1...) First: as plenty of other have said, the property is just stunning. Very funky-cool, but not TOO hip. It's dark-ish in a good way -- very cool and soothing to come out of the summer heat to, with typical Starwood/W mood music in the public areas, funky decor (lots of purple/magenta subtle neon, faceted costume jewels made into climbing vines in the elevators, silky cord 'curtains' in some of the rooms -- very Starck/moderne without going over the top. Second: the staff is both very well-trained *and* spectacularly helpful (too many places have one or the other but not both). They focus on going the extra little bit, offering things *before* you realize you need them (example: our door-guy, who looked like Jack LaLanne, brought me packets of lemon 'moist-wipes' when I came in from a hot afternoon -- and then handed me some on my way out the following day). The concierge service as good, and thorough, as a CEO's executive assistant (on my first visit, I happened to mention I liked the t-shirts that the staff wore at the coffee place around the corner -- when I came back, there was one waiting for me (!) >;-) The down side (and to be fair, this is probably market pressure at work, in the age of online discount booking): the razors (room rates) are reasonable; the blades (everything else) will kill you. The minibar/room-service prices are what-you'd-expect-crazy-expensive, sure -- I've never seen a $10 room-service burger and never expect to. But: $20-25 drinks in the bar (and I'm not talking specialties - this is for a gin-and-tonic, and not a premium call-brand either)?!? $6-7 for the bottle of water in the room. (They do give you a couple of small ones, gratis, though.) They didn't offer a bottle of wine as a Starwood points gift, as many other W's/Meridiens do -- and the bottle of red in the room was outrageously expensive. We don't travel cheaply -- but we just can't STAND getting nickel-and-dimed -- or outright milked -- just because they've got you right there. *** (Smart travelers will walk barely one block to the Migros supermarket, where a WIDE selection of food & drink (including beer, wine, liquor, etc.) -- and everything else -- is available at VERY reasonable prices.) In-room Internet is really pricey, too (unless you've got SW status) -- AND you have to constantly sign in with a number of things to re-fill-in -- AND you can't have more than one device on at a time. You'd think that'd be enough, but: (A) there were two of us, (B) we also had our smartphones, and (C) we couldn't figure out how to sign off ONE device so another could sign on. Minor annoyances each, but added up, it was an unnecessary irritation. We were also a little irritated that two groups had taken up enough of the hotel that we ended up not only not being upgraded this time -- we're OK with that! -- BUT that we got stuck with what someone else here complained about: a cramped \"efficiency\" room (335) near the end of the (very long) hallway, with no actual bathroom! There was a sink-in-a-closet, across from a toilet-closet, and a shower-closet. The desk chair, at the foot of the bed, didn't have enough room to sit at a comfortable distance from the desk -- and it was impossible for one of us to get past the chair to the other side of the bed when the other was sitting there. ETC.: The bed was VERY comfy, as others have said, like all Starwood properties. We can't stand those \"rainfall\" overhead showerheads, although some people inexplicably like water pouring all over their heads and into their eyes! :-) -- and would've liked the shower 'wand' to be in a holder where you can aim it (we ended up with very clean necks). The location isn't bad at all -- you're a 10 minute walk from the end of the local tram line which takes you right to the key tourist attractions; you can also catch the funicular at that station to the top of the hill for the VERY neat Beyoglu shopping/people-watching area.

He was so eager to show us around and so proud of his city; it was infectious. A few days into our trip, Cem directed us to a restaurant around the corner but it was closed and he spotted us crossing the lobby with our heads hung in defeat on our way back to the room and he immediately got up and personally escorted us around the neighborhood trying to find lahmajun (we had a craving). It was also my bf's birthday and Cem booked us a wonderful reservation. When we came back to our room, we found a card signed by the entire staff and a decadent chocolate pistachio cake. Such a great surprise. The only unfortunate thing is that the letter \"W\" does not exist in Turkish so explaining the location of your hotel is a little difficult. The area also caters to the uber rich shopping crowd, one that I don't tend to follow. The street is historic and beautiful to walk around, however.

It sounded like it was in a good location and within walking distance of most of the hip cafes and shops in the area. Boy, was I wrong! There are few cafes in the area unless you want to get a coffee. None of the hip shops are open yet, so there are very few pedestrians on the street. To get anywhere, you have to catch a taxi, which turned out to be fine because you would find this with several of the other options in Istanbul. The room itself was over the top in some respects, but more like something you would find at a Holiday Inn. The bathroom was bizarre...I had a superior room with a cabanna. The shower opens up into the room so there is no privacy at all. The lighting in the bathroom was so dark that you felt like you were in a night club. I have to say that the people in the hotel were very nice and helpful, except for when the manager woke me up to ask me if I was satisfied with the hotel. Otherwise, they were very nice and helpful. I checked out the Day Spa and I would compare it to a creepy sauna. It is down a obscure corridor and is so dark and tiny that you feel like you just want to get out of there. I'm not sure why the hotel even bothered to have a spa if they were going to make it so uninviting. The breakfast room is very nice, but I would recommend that they include the breakfast in the price. The buffet had a lot of choices, but nothing that you could really eat. The healthy section had celery sticks and some nuts, but unless you are a squirrel, there was not much else which was edible. If they just included the breakfast (and added it to the cost of the room), then it would be more in keeping with what they are trying to convey. It really surprised me that they even charged for a small bottle of water in the room. Again, why not make it free and add the charge to the room? They even charge for the internet although most hotels now offer this for free. Overall, it felt like I was staying in a dark nightclub, but without the ambiance.

During our first stay we were upgraded to a fourth-floor Fabulous room; for our second stay, which cost more in points because the basic level room was sold out, we got a Mega room on the third floor. The rooms: Both rooms were good. The Fabulous room had a skylight and a tiny outdoor terrace with a table and chairs, while the Mega room was significantly bigger and brighter with three huge windows, high ceilings and better seating in the room. We much preferred the more spacious room. We thought the outdoor space attached to some rooms was pretty useless, considering there's no view to be had and it's too hot in summer to sit outside. Be very choosy about your room class at the lower end -- our first upgrade, which we rejected, was to a Spectacular room on the first floor, below street level. The room had a little outdoor patio, but it was otherwise smallish and dark; the A/C didn't work well; and the bathroom was basically built right into the room, with the shower and toilet doors opening into the living area, which made the whole space seem even more cramped. If we had been stuck in that room for the duration of our stay, we would be writing a vastly different review. (In any case, we probably would have checked out of the hotel if that had been the only room class available.) By far, our favorite thing about our rooms was the \"W Signature\" bed, which was indescribably plush and comfortable, with a down feather topper, down pillows, soft sheets and a down comforter -- like sinking into a cloud. Climbing into that bed was a major highlight of each day. We have never slept better. (You'll appreciate the W's beds even more, once you've traveled around the country staying in Turkish hotels.) The bathrooms were also excellent, with big mirrors, huge marble walk-in showers equipped with handheld and rain shower heads, and a separate toilet room. Other cool amenities: DVD player, iPod dock, flat-screen TV, spacious work desk with built-in outlets, current copy of TimeOut Istanbul and complimentary welcome snacks and bottled water for SPG members. The hotel: Free Wi-Fi in all common spaces (in-room access is a total rip-off, which is frustratingly typical of all Starwood properties); comfortable 24-hour bar/lounge with cocktails at exorbitant prices (typical of Turkey); outdoor patio; small but adequate fitness room with free earbuds for plugging into TVs on aerobic equipment; restaurant on-site (we had yummy sandwiches there for lunch one day); prompt room service, though the food can be generously described as uneven. The location: If you're planning to spend all your time in Sultanahmet (Old Town), there are more conveniently located hotels than the W, which is across the bridge in the Besiktas neighborhood, a block from the Bosphorus and northeast of Beyoglu (New Town). That said, the hotel is an easy 10-minute walk to the tram (which goes directly to all the Old Town sights -- Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Cistern, Cemberlitas Hamam, Grand Bazaar, etc.) and a subway stop (which takes you to Taksim Square, where the main pedestrian thoroughfare in Beyoglu, Istiklal Caddesi, begins). You could also take cheap cabs everywhere -- Sultanahmet is about 10 or 15 minutes away by taxi, but there's so much traffic during the day, you'll probably get there faster by tram. We really liked staying in this part of town because it was a lot more Turkish; Sultanahmet is overpacked with tourists and carpet sellers. Besiktas is also conveniently located to Beyoglu and other Istanbul neighborhoods worth visiting for the city's better restaurants and shops. Around the hotel itself, there are lots of high-end boutiques (nothing you can't get in the U.S., though); just up the block, there's a coffee shop and a boutique wine bar, plus lots of little local bodegas and a liquor/wine shop with a good selection of Turkish wines. Overall, we really liked the W and thought it was absolutely worth staying in using Starwood points, but it's hard to say whether we would have picked it if we had to pay cash. The rooms aren't cheap and there is no shortage of luxurious hotel rooms in Istanbul. Other tips: -Giving taxi drivers a street address is futile. Better to direct them with landmarks. So, if you're heading back to the W, which most taxi drivers don't know, tell them it's across the street from Dolmabahce Palace in Besiktas and they'll know where you're headed. -Most of the restaurants we tried served food only until 11p, but stayed open later for drinks. A few places we really liked: Mikla (get the tasting menu and arrive before sunset), Cezayir, Giritli. For baklava, go to Gulluoglu; there's a shop at the Grand Bazaar stop on the tram. We thought Abracadabra, which gets raves, was totally overrated. Check out http://istanbuleats.com/ or http://chowhound.chow.com/boards or other food blogs for recommendations. -Buy a Turkish rug!

In many ways, the hotel didn't meet my expectations. First, my room was very small, not at all how the \"typical\" room appeared on the website. Next, as others have commented, the noise from the hallways was very audible in the room. The toilet and shower were separate, which is fine, but the shower was much smaller than the website implied and it reminded me of a \"prefabricated\" unit. The sink and vanity area were right out in the bedroom, which would not afford the right amount of privacy if more than one person occupied the room. The bed, while it would have been comfortable for most people, was way too soft for me, and when I inquired about getting a harder bed, I was told that all the beds were the same. It's OK to have a \"signature bed,\" but there should be some variety to accommodate different guest preferences. Finally, I thought the service in the bar was very slow and the waiter mixed up the order.

I did email the hotel that I was going to have an early arrival. Turns out, my plane arrived far earlier than planned and I got to the hotel around 7 am. Unfortunately, they did not have a room ready so they stored our luggage for us and we went out around the Sultahmet area for sightseeing. The room was ready when we returned in the late afternoon. I should mention that I used Backpackers Travel Agency (through the Turkey Travel Planner website) to book my airport transfer to/from the airport. It was far cheaper than other options and I didn't have to look forward to haggling/arguing with the taxi driver. The service was prompt and friendly, even though the drivers didn't speak much English. The hotel located at the corner of 2 streets and was very modern and funky. As a SPG Platinum, I received an upgrade to a suite. The suite isn't what I'm used to in regards to separate sitting and sleeping areas, but it certainly seems larger than many of the rooms mentioned from other travellers. The room was in a rectangle shape with a small chair/table in the corner. There was a fairly good sized working desk with a DVD player hidden in one of the drawers. There was a double sink in the bathroom and the shower/toilet are in separate and enclosed stalls. I must say that shower stall felt spartan although it was surrounded by marble/granite with horizontal stripes. It kind of made me think that was how \"institutional\" showers might feel. The shower controls were \"Japan-style\" with separate knobs for temperature control. The toilet was a strange rectangle shaped unit with a \"cleaner\" (think Japan, again) sticking out. Unlike Japan, that thing stuck out all the time and a little too much. Let's say I was surprised a few times when I leaned back just a little. There was a small outdoor patio with 2 chairs and there was a skylight in the room that could be opened. The HVAC in the room is extremely difficult to operate. I would think I had it sorted but there wasn't any A/C to be felt. Even to this day, I'm not sure if I knew how to use it correctly or whether the A/C just wasn't up to snuff. The TV was built into the wall that separate the bathroom. Problem is, there was quite a reflection/glare off the wall so it was really hard to see. In addition, there didn't seem to be any external speakers so I had to turn up the volume to maximum settings most of the time. There is a separate Bose soundwave system on the night table.The telephone was the Cisco touch-screen kind and I found it useful that I could get weather on that thing. For internet, you have to sign up online but use a function on the phone to get your special code to enter. First time I've seen that set-up. The light controls on the wall were pretty funky and had different lighting \"moods\". I should mention that the elevators use a touch system and I had to \"learn\" how to press it from my room floor. In terms of noise, it seems I had it lucky and heard nothing from neighbours or the hallway even though my room was closest to the elevators. One night, I did hear sound from the nightclub although my room was on the highest floor. Let's just say this was extremely annoying. For taxis, it seemed taxis from the hotel were ok and used the meters. It should be around 15TL to get to the Blue Mosque area. However, other taxis in the city weren't as honest. We would usually take a taxi to Sultahmet in the morning but take the metro to Kabatas - the closest stop to the hotel. From Kabatas, it's a dog's breakfast with taxis. One time, some taxi tried to tell me there was construction and he'd need to take a circuitous route - all to the tune of 20TL. We got out of that taxi right away. It seems negotiating down to 5TL was generally accepted for the Kabatas-hotel run. You can walk to the hotel from Kabatas but the traffic pollution is horrendous. We did it one day and vowed never to do it again. From Taksim to the hotel, it should be about 7TL on the meter. Let's just say most taxi drivers don't speak English (not that I expect them to) so it'd be wise to learn numbers and have your address written down for them. Around the hotel area, just behind the hotel on the right is Cafe Nero. We found it after the 2nd day and it was a god-send for good Italian coffee and paninis. There are some restos if you walk further and we tried an Italian place but it was awful. Behind the hotel on the left, you'll encounter a supermarket. Walk down the street where the supermarket is and you'll encounter a ton of local restos. We ate here most of the time. Prices were generally reasonable but quality varied a lot. For service, it was generally superb. We did talk to most of the front staff people and they were very helpful. We didn't use the concierge. However, I did have one problem trying to get body wash. The body wash wasn't replenished after cleaning so we had to phone down on the last day to get a bottle. It took 3 calls and about 45 min. After the first 2 calls, someone finally got to my room. However, he messed up by getting shampoo first, then conditioner. I finally gave him the bottle that I wanted replaced and never heard from him again. That necessitated the 3rd call in which he finally returned and got it right. Would I return? Probably as I don't want to stay in the Sultahmet area. If the metro actually extended as far as the hotel, it'd be a definite yes.

Another flaw is that the cabanas that come with many of the rooms are not covered, which limits their usefulness for those who like a little shade. Service was also spotty. The hotel sent an email days before my stay asking if there was anything they could do for me in advance of my arrival. My response was apparently ignored. When we arrived, we were told that we were getting a triple upgrade, but the room we ended up getting was exactly what we expected.

The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the water, and a 15 minute walk to the tram that takes you to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Grand Bazaar, etc. The service was impeccable. The concierge gave us a great dinner recommendation, and the front desk was very responsive to any request that arose. Out of the 8 hotels we stayed in over our 2 week trip, this was probably the most comfortable and maybe my favorite! I would not recommend this hotel to the older or more traditional crowd.

Overall, my 3-night W. hotel stay was a major disappointment. The hotel featured 3.5 star service, masquerading in 5 star prices. The GOOD: - nice room, especially if you have a patio. - everything is new and clean. - very good bed. - excellent shower, but no bathtub. - service got better by 3rd day, as staff begin to recognize me, but it was well below par for first few days. The BAD: - Not good value: overpriced. - upon checking in at 9pm, I was told the concierge would not be on-duty till the next morning (till after 11am!). Totally unacceptable, as I was looking for recommendations on dining and night life, upon my arrival; and early morning advise for the next day. - Over 4 days at the hotel, I only saw the concierge at his station once. - despite being a Gold SPG member, it was a hassle to get a free room upgraded. The front desk clerk wasn't allowed to make a decision, and had to call the duty manager (who didn't seem to be at the hotel!, and finally get permission after I refused to back down). Don't expect to get your room upgraded for free (as some other posters have indicated). - the hotel was quite. I'd guess 1/3 full. Making the room upgrade teeth-pulling exercise even more annoying - its not like there weren't lots of empty rooms. OTHER COMMENTS: - The restaurant was better value, but like the rest of the hotel, its so dark that you can't even see what you're eating. If you are dining alone, the wait staff largely ignore you. - W does not give provide even a tiny bottle of complimentary drinking water. Thirsty? Pony up 9 TL for a tiniest of bottles. - no newspaper delivered in the morning. - lacking toiletries in the room (toothbrush, show cap, q-tips, etc). - W's web site has no option for arranging hotel pick-up from the airport. Guests have to fend for themselves. There is no estimate for how much a taxi would cost, or travel time. - W. Lack charm, and a soul. It left me feeling cold. I would have checked out of the hotel the first night, if I hadn't already booked and pre-paid on-line. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS to W: - For god sakes, hire some women at the hotel. With all your stern-faced male staff milling around the front dark entrance, it felt like I was about to mugged. - buy a couple of light bulbs for the hotel. - iPod dock is a nice touch, but it is a tight fit for an iPhone.

We had a 'Spectacular' room with outdoor cabana - the cabana is a lovely feature but it was not really warm enough to sit outside during our stay in early May and probably only really of use in the peak summer months. If we were to visit in Winter, would stick to the cheaper 'Wonderful' rooms. Cons Breakfast is pretty average and expensive for the quality of the food. We only had one breakfast at the hotel and went out for remainder of our stay. There is no physical divide between the smoking and non-smoking sections in the restaurant but this is not unique to the W and seems to happen everywhere in Istanbul. Lack of sound proofing between rooms. Whilst the hotel is very quiet in terms of external traffic noise, there is a notable lack of sound proofing between the rooms. Not sure if this was exacerbated by the fact that our room had a connecting door to the room next door. Luckily we were not affected by this at night but it was quite annoying to be party to several noisy phone conversations next door in the mornings. Pros Excellent concierge service - probably the most impressive and friendly/honest service that have encountered in a hotel. Cem gave us some great tips about restaurants, sight-seeing and taxis. Good location for bars and restaurants (short taxi journey away in Taksim and Ortakoy). Besiktas is interesting for a wander and to try some street food/casual local places. Vogue was an excellent recommendation and only about 3 minutes walk away from the hotel. Whilst the hotel is not on the water, it is very close to the Bosphorus and the ferry stop of Besiktas and it is easy to get around to Sultanahmet etc. from here.

We just spent 5 wonderful nights at the W Istanbul, and the only bad thing about our stay was that we had to leave. I had been to Istanbul six months earlier on a work-related trip, and I enjoyed my time in the city so much that I wanted to return with my spouse. I booked using Starwood points and chose the W. It is one of the best choices I have ever made. We arrived very late on the evening of December 25, and the night manager greeted us. After over 24 hours of traveling, it was a wonderful welcome. We were upgraded to a studio suite (room 308) because of my Platinum status, and everything about the room was to our liking: + The bed was incredibly comfortable. + The different lighting settings added a great atmosphere to the room. + The rain shower was refreshing first thing in the morning or after a long day of exploring. + The towels were the largest and most absorbent we have ever used, and they always smelled so fresh. + The TV had a great picture and sound. The room was so big, though, that we had to turn it up if we wanted to hear it from bed. On top of all of this, EVERYONE we encountered at the W--from managers to the housekeeping personnel and everyone in between--treated us as though it were their personal mission to make our stay THE most enjoyable stay we had ever had. From what we could see, every guest was treated the same way. The concierge, Cem, deserves special mention. He was always ready to offer suggestions and make reservations whenever we asked. He should give lessons on how to be the perfect concierge. As for the location, it's not in the Old Town, but I think that's an advantage. The hotel is a 15-20 minute walk to the Kabata\u00c5\u0178 tram stop. From there, you can take a direct tram across the Golden Horn that makes stops steps from the Spice Bazaar, Topkap\u00c4\u00b1 Palace, Hagia Sophia, The Blue Mosque, or the Grand Bazaar. Alternatively, if you want to take a taxi, the hotel will call a trusted company that it knows treats customers fairly. Taxis are a bargain in Istanbul as long as you get a trustworthy driver, and that's a guarantee from the W. Another transportation option is to take a ferry from Be\u00c5\u0178ikta\u00c5\u0178 pier (just across the main street from the W) across the Bosphorus to Kad\u00c4\u00b1k\u00c3\u00b6y on the Asian side to visit the market and eat at \u00c3\u2021iya Sofras\u00c3\u00bd. (This was an excellent recommendation from Cem.) From there, you can take another ferry to Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc, which is very close to a tram stop and the Spice Bazaar. The neighborhood itself is a great place to explore. In addition to all of the upscale shops in the immediate area, there are many shopping and dining options close by. As you exit the W, turn right and walk up the hill about 20m and you will find a Caffe Nero. Or turn right, walk up the hill, and you will find a Migros Supermarket. Turn right at Migros and there are at least a dozen kebap shops and other restaurants as well as bakeries. Almost everyone in this area is a local, so you will see a different side of Istanbul than you will in Taksim or the Old Town.

A beer that cost $2 in a store sells for $10; there is 2/10 market in the NYC as well. It took a half an hour for somebody to wait on us although the bar was half empty. If you are visiting Istanbul and drinking at the W, then shame on you. My only excuse was that it was my first night. The restaurant, The Spice Market, was a better experience but again you should be able to do better. Food quality, atmosphere, prices were on par with New York City - but there was nothing about the restaurant that distinguishes it from one of a hundred similar restaurants in New York City. Did I mention Cem, that guy [--] rocks! With respect to location. Definitely better than staying in Old Town. If you want to go to that part of the city, take the Tram.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cMarvelous experience\u201d", "Author": "Nana_JP", "ReviewID": "UR23025080", "Content": "My friend and I spent three nights at the W while on a weekend visit to Istanbul. It is very modern and trendy with lots of neon lights and amazingly comfortable beds. The location was just fine with an easy taxi ride to and from the major sights and the tram that goes all the way to the Sultanahmet is only one block away. We took the opportunity to walk to several fun neighborhoods in the area to shop and eat. I highly recommend the Chocolate Caf\u00c3\u00a9 on the street to the right of the hotel entrance, back a block or two, for breakfast- especially if eggs and latte is your thing. Also the Nero Coffee Shop to the street on the left of the hotel entrance was a great place to get coffee and pastries from morning to night. The area around the hotel is big name shopping, so if Prada and Jimmy Choo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are of interest, you will be in heaven. For most of us it is great window shopping. While the ambience is certainly interesting, the very best part of the W is the staff. Every single person we met had a smile and friendly manner. Coming back in after a day of sightseeing really did feel like coming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with all the greetings and requests for a summation of our day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adventures. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to many friendly hotels, but the Istanbul W far surpasses anything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced before. One suggestion for visitors; the concierge can arrange reservations to see the Mevlana Sufi Sema Ceremony (whirling dervishes). This is not a glitzy performance but a traditional sacred ceremony in which the mystical dance and spiritual music is presented in a very dignified manner. It was amazing and the highlight of our remarkable trip to Istanbul. One warning for visitors; the hotel staff will get your taxi and make sure the driver knows where you are going and the meter is running. Be careful coming back via taxi! On one trip back to the hotel the meter was running when we started (I always check) but when we arrived the driver had obviously done something to the meter and it had a line of characters on it instead of the fare. He charged us 40 YTL which was the most expensive taxi trip we had including to/from the airport.

Super stylish and cool, with neon lights throughout, modern decor, and sensual aromas and music permeating the corridors. What the room lacks in size (average by European standards), it makes up with in unique amenities (DVD player, IPOD docking station, glass enclosed TV, 5 different levels of lighting to create any level of mood in the room). The rooms' layout is different in that there really is not a separation from the bedroom area and the shower/sink and toilet area. Therefore, when you walk out of the shower, (and it is a great overhead rain shower, but there is no tub), out of the toilet or wash at the sink, you are viewed in the bedroom, which does not allow for privacy for the modest guest. As stated before, the bedding is wonderful, but the minibar and services throughout the hotel are expensive. The staff is great, and knowledgeable and yes there are plenty of them. They were completeIy staffed when we left for an early morning flight at 4:30 in the morning! As first time visitors to Istanbul, we did not find the location off putting. (You have the best of both worlds - the location is in the upscale redeveloped area of the city, with high end designer stores lining the streets, but one street over is the \"real\" local flair where you have everyday life, retail and grocery stores and restaurants). We liked the location because we were able to escape the hustle and bustle of Istanbul, (AND YOU WILL BE CONSTANTLY HUSTLED) yet join it when we chose. Yes, the taxi driver had to ask for directions to the hotel from another driver upon our arrival, but we were able to use the local transportation, trams and buses with ease, once we were out and about. The hotel is not in Old Town, where the majority of the sites are located, but a 10-15 walk to the tram will get to there within another 10 minutes for a whopping 1.40 YTL! A Taxi cost about 10YTL, so it is a easy excursion either way. We enjoyed our stay at the W. It is contemporary and fun.

The hotel is VERY hip -- while we were there, there were two celebrity parties complete with papparazzi! Cab drivers, tour operators, and other hotel management seemed very impressed that we were staying at the W. By European standards, the rooms are spacious -- not huge, but spacious. But they are dark. The restaurant is VERY expensive and there are not a lot of places to eat nearby. The hotel is the flagship property in an urban renewal project. The hotel is very close to the soccer stadium and a blue collar neighborhood. It's also across the street from one of the sultan's palaces and the ferry to the Asian side of the country. This was my 3rd trip to Istanbul, so I was familiar with the various neighborhoods and how to reach them. If this were my first trip, I would have felt rather isoloated at the W. So I have to say the location is not really ideal for the first-time visitor (although one of the 4 seasons is down the road). the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. one of the best aspects was the lounge area just off the main lobby. we utilized it each night to entertain friends traveling with us.

The taxi driver at the airport didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where it was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even given a map and the address from the hotel website he had to confer with two or three other drivers. We thought that this was maybe a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dumb driver\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd situation but it happened on every taxi ride we took back to the hotel. In each case after the initial ride in from the airport, we gave the driver the card given to us by the concierge. In one case we ended up at Sulimaniye Mosque. The effect of this was that my wife became a virtual prisoner in the hotel, unwilling to go out on her own. We thought the room was very small for what it was advertised to be, even though we'd upgraded to the so-called \"Spectacular\" room . You cannot pull out the chair at the desk without it hitting the bed and then it blocks anyone else in the room from moving about. When room service brought our order, the waiter even asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153where do I put the tray\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; the trays were larger than the desk and we had to eat off the bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not quite as romantic as we would have hoped. The TV remote control would not operate the TV reliably from where I was lying on the bed so I called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever/Whenever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and asked them to change the batteries. A technician duly arrived; he pointed the remote at the TV from about 60cm away and it worked so he left saying there was no need to change the batteries. From my position on the bed it still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. I swapped the batteries with the ones from my travel flashlight and it worked fine. The technical answer to this is that effective power of a radiated beam reduces relative to the square of the distance the beam travels. At 3 metres from the television the received strength is 25 times less than at 60cm. The simple answer would have been to change the batteries as requested. I sure hope those few cents were worth saving. We went to the terrace bar but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anywhere to sit and were made to feel uncomfortable as we stood waiting. The layout of the bar is poor as there is no way you can fit 4 real people in the corner. The shower had a wonderful drench function. Unfortunately the door doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seal so lots of water leaks out into the floor leaving a gigantic puddle which we then had to mop up using all the towels. The hotel info guide states that we could order in-room dining from the Spice Market restaurant. When I called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever/Whenever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a menu for this I was told it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible. I found a partial menu from the Spice Market on the telephone and ordered what we wanted. My order was accepted and everything showed (except one item) although it took a very long while. There were loose electrical wires in the cabana. I mentioned this to the receptionist who said it would be taken care of. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Overall, the stay was disappointing; to us it seemed like the entire philosophy is a triumph of style over substance. A Ferrari isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much good if the engine misfires and the steering is wobbly.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "W Istanbul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d814852-Reviews-W_Istanbul-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$255 - $505*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Suleyman Seba Cad 22</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Akaretler</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34357</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "814852", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/6c/00/83/w-istanbul.jpg"}}
