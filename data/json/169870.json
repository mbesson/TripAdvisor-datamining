All in all this was my Worst experience in Playa del Carmen. I'm not a picky person when it comes to hotels in Playa del Carmen. We look for location, clean, affordable, and relaxing. We do not stay all-inclusive and prefer the smaller boutique hotels. This hotel has a wonderful location but needs extensive updates and maintenance. I should have demanded a refund and went to another hotel. I would not stay here again and would not recommend this hotel to anyone else. Many other places in Playa with comparable or better rates with much better facilities. Detailed Review... My husband and I stayed at Hotel Pelicano Inn for 5 nights. Jan 8-13, 2011. We have been to Playa several times and decided this trip to fly down and find a place to stay instead of doing reservations. (we did our online research, reviews, etc and had list of options to check). So I was told they had rooms available and we could stay in Oceanview room for 3 nights and then move to an Oceanfront room remaining 2 nights. I did take a look at the room before booking. Paid for all 5 nights and walked to our room. Then it all went downhill from there... Just as an FYI - there are no tv\u2019s or radio/clocks in the rooms. Room 306 - clean, spacious room but dated with suprisingly comfortable bed for Mexico. My husband had to move the small refrigerator to different area of room to find an outlet that would work. Water would not work when I went to flush toilet, sink and shower no water. So go to front desk to be told it will be fixed right away. Three hours later they tell us it's fixed. So we have wasted half of our day waiting around. Noticed a slight smell but thought maybe it was where water had been off for some time. Went to dinner came back and smell was worse. Decided to close door to bathroom and see what the morning would hold. Well I almost got sick when I went to use bathroom next morning, it smelled like pure sewage. So we went downstairs to tell front desk something has to be done. This was on Sunday. I was told manager was not working and was out of town. I explained the smell was horrible and we should be moved that we were wasting our vacation. He explained we could pay extra and move to Oceanfront room. I would not agree to paying extra as the reason for moving was not out of my convenience. Housekeeping agreed there was definitely a problem in room. Finally around 12 noon after several trips of speaking with front desk I told them to either refund our money for the entire stay or move us to an Oceanfront room with no extra cost. Finally they told us we could move to oceanfront room. Room 218 - Oceanfront room... Again clean but needs updates. The lamp in the room looked to have either so much dust gathered on it or it was mildew. There was no ceiling fan in this room and the lighting was very minimal. Shower had lots of pressure but at best the water was luke warm never any Hot water. The bed in this room was more than undesirable, even for Mexico. The bed sank in the middle (I don\u2019t mean you rolled to the middle it was broken length wise in the middle. It was shaped like a banana. After 4 nights of this bed my husband and I both were aching in our hip and back (and we are only 30&31 years old). This room also had small refrigerator. The view from this room was beautiful with large, spacious balcony. You could hear the music from Fusion at night. The music played some nights until 2am but with the balcony door closed you could hardly hear the music. The music was actually quite nice especially since we did not have tv or radio. Housekeeping staff did good job keeping the room clean. Most of the problems we encountered are more on the level of managment and owner issues that need to be addressed in order for this hotel to be a pleasant stay. The sad part is the location and lay out of hotel makes for potentially nice hotel someone just needs to come in and spruce the place up quite a bit. Again much better hotels for same or cheaper prices in my opinion!", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gary", "Title": "\u201cSupberb Staff!\u201d", "Author": "Garypsw", "ReviewID": "UR89068445", "Content": "Awsome hotel.

We always stay at small Mexican hotels. We go on holiday to get away from our over-regulated home country. We like having to improvise. We like being in a place where not everyone speaks English. We like having to find our way in unfamiliar places and situations. The toilet and the shower in our room were clean and worked well. There was always hot water. Some of the tiles had dark lines around them, but this is a tropical place, and mould can appear overnight. The furnishings in our room were plain, but adequate. Our room was cleaned daily by the same cheerful lady who made the beds so that they looked crisp after her every visit. After she had cleaned our room, the toilet and washbasin area were sparkling clean, and whatever it was that she mopped the floor with, left the room with a pleasant smell. We did not care that she spoke only Spanish: We communicated by supplementing our meager Spanish with sign language. It was fun. Mario, at the front desk, always had a cheerful smile and an Ola! He\u2019d seemed a bit glum on our first day, but my wife did an exaggerated mime of a smile at him, which broke the ice and we got on well. When I told him that some of the lights in our room were burned out, he had them replaced right away. Typically for a small Mexican hotel, some switches were broken. There were more than enough electrical outlets for our needs. Staff at the beach tended to look a bit sour, although they always got an umbrella for us when we asked. My wife found the mattress to be too hard. It has always been so, wherever we\u2019ve been in Mexico, so she always brings a self inflating camping mattress that gives her the comfort she needs. We especially liked having our own security box, where we could lock up our passports and other valuables whenever we needed to. There was one negative thing about our visit, an issue referred to by a previous reviewer: the room that we had reserved (and prepaid for) was not available when we arrived late at night. We were going to make an issue of it, but found no fault with the room they gave us, and decided to let the matter rest. The problem might have arisen because, although most people have weekend arrivals/departures, we were mid-weekers. Midweek airfares were lowest for us. We\u2019d have liked to have had a small refrigerator, and the price we paid ($100/night) would seem to have justified that; however, we had booked rather late, so there wasn\u2019t much choice in hotels, and anyway, there was a Mini Mart about 50 feet from the Pelicano entry.

Even though I used this site to review the hotel prior to going, we tried to keep a good attitude and hoped for the best when booking here. We have been at the Pelicano three , now four times since 1995. The first time included a free buffet breakfast, new towels each day formed into those wonderful swans and other animals and a staff that were wonderful and made our stays great. Those days are over -period. The present management only wants your money without giving any service back. The beach bar staff, when even present, are surly and not pleasant. The rooms are filthy, with loud air conditioners, leaking toilets, electric wires hanging out of the wall etc. The beds were atrocious and had some kind of pad, not a mattress. Perfectly acceptable in a 1/2 star hotel- not a three star as advertised. There is NO area with shade for the hotel guests on the beach. All the palapas once set aside for guests are now used by the bar. They stood empty the entire four days of our stay. You had to buy a drink to sit under one. Our son had a drink from the adjoining restaurant ( We couldn't find any staff to get one from the Pelicano) and instantly staff appeared from seemly nowhere and told him he couldn't have any drinks other than ones bought there. A reasonable request but downright stupid when we were the only ones there and we were paying guests. My advice in order to remain in this most wonderful of locations- right on the beach, close to Fifth Ave. and the ferry terminal- is to try the Treetops which is currently being remodeled (Sept '07) The old Albatross Hotel is gone, replaced by a new hotel. It may be OK -wasn't open yet. Most of the small hotels are being replaced by condos. Playa is rapidly turning into a mini-Cancun. More time-share hawkers than ever. Watch out for them. Fifth Avenue is now paved and runs seemly for miles from the ferry landing all the way down to the new resort hotels on the north beach. The new cruise ship pier is creating severe beach erosion. I saw sandbags all along the area around the pier to hold on to the beach. The local shops are being pushed out, replaced by high end boutiques, mostly Italian. In fact the town seems to be heavily catering to Italians with restaurants and shops.

This was the only hotel available for us near the beach, so we picked it up without much expectation. However, Pelicano Inn was the worst hotel we ever stayed in all over the world. I cannot complain about aged building and stinky room with this price range (it was about $110/night, not too much for the holiday season), but I was hoping it would be at least clean. The room was so dirty, with a lot of dust and a bunch of hairs on the floor. The sheets were not just dirty but also worn out badly. Mexican people working for such small hotels in this town are always nice, but not at Pelicano Inn. They are rude and not courteous at all. One staff did not even say hi or welcome when we checked in. All he cared was us paying a balace, and there was no explanation for the safety box or breakfast. I was thinking why they are in tourism business if they don't even want to talk to their guests nicely. On the first night, we couldn't find towels in our room and went to the front desk asking for them nicely. The staff who was there when we checked in said they would be up in our room when we returned from dinner, but they were not. I went back to the front desk again, and he gave me beach towels. I was asking for bath towels but he said \"it is the same!\" without any apology. At this point, I already wanted to leave Pelicano Inn and actually looked for a room at next door (nicest Alhambra, and pretty new mosquito hotel) but of course there was no vacancy. Next morning around 8 am, my husband went down to the front desk asking if there was a hair dryer he could borrow, but there was only a sleeping security person. When my husband talked to him, he opened his eyes and went back to sleep. My husband was trying to wake him up, but he never opened his eyes again even though he was hearing what my husband saying. My husband was upset and looked for someone else, but there was no one around. At 8 in the morning, no staff but sleeping security in the hotel. I have never faced this situation in the all the other small hotels in town, even in the much cheaper motels. Another guest who saw my husband talking to him was saying \"I asked for a wake-up call but he didn't wake me up, this hotel sucks!\" No wonder the hotel still had vacancy in the new year even though it is located on the perfect area on the beach. On the second and third night, we got really dirty, worn out towels with blood stain and other kinds of stains. On the fourth night, we did not get towels again. We tipped enough for the maid, and I have no idea why they were like this. The room was never cleaned properly during our stay. On the check out day, the same staff did not even say good bye or thank you. I asked him if the cab fare to the airport was still $39, but he said he did not know and it would depend on the driver. The cab fare is fixed in most of the case, especially to the airport, and I thought it was my fault that I still tried to communicate with him. We did not see any smile or did not hear any greeting from any staff and they seem really sick of working there. It is more than \"unfriendly\", it is just \"rude\". Here is a suggestion. There are many nice hotels around, so please do not let this hotel ruin your vacation. I wish I could give 0 out of 5.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBasic\u201d", "Author": "Becky55", "ReviewID": "UR6341194", "Content": "very basic and very cheap.

Questions for an alternative deposite (passport) where turned down within giving reasons. While checking out, the front desk staff claimed that we never signed anything and showed as a bunch of credit card strips as a proove. I called the police and suddenly, our credit card strip DID show up. And guess what .... no explanations and no appology. Just a few very unpolite side comments. Luckily, we had enough time to handle this with the police. CONCLUSION: Please try to avoid this trouble maker hotel! There are so many hotels in Playa with a much better price/performance ratio!!

While not expecting luxury (this was my second time at this hotel), and really who can beat eighty bucks for a beachfront room, there were some problems that could prevent me from staying at this awesome little hotel again until the owner decides to start paying attention. There's too much competition these days: No receipt for the room, and I paid in cash. Was told that there were no receipts left after a group of 25 checked in. Cost of the room went to 120 if I paid by CC. At least one surly waiter. The first morning, I walked into the restaurant to get a cup of coffee form the percolator, but was told that the coffee was \"for the group of 25.\" What?? Am I not a guest at the hotel? Did I do the wrong by getting my own cup? If so, why wasn't I offered a cup later...they knew I wanted some coffee! This waiter had some serious customer service issues. Of course I had some issues of my own, as this was my second week of quitting smoking. I was nasty to this same waiter when he asked me to move my reclining chair from underneath a palapa. Those are reserved for tables, which are put out around lunchtime. But they guy again didn't ask very nice. I did eventually move and received an umbrella for shade. The waitstaff is very lethargic. Some of the beach waiters in Playa, especially those in front of Capt Dave's and the Mimi work hard and always receive a good tip from me. Considering that the waitstaff at the pelicano have their beach plus the beach right next door where you rent beach chairs you would think that they could make a decent living if they hustled. Not much tip from me; I had to get up whenever I wanted something. The air conditioner in the upstairs beachfront room did not work well, and yes it leaked on my clothes. One morning a squatter had taken over the massage tent, until about 11am. The guy may have been homeless, or he may have been too borracho to continue walking, but in any case the hotel staff should have made him gone at 8am, or whenever they arrived. A couple of the waitstaff's friends partied for two days at the beach bar. Should this be a problem? Maybe not, but they were very drunk; one of them almost drowned in the ocean. A complaint to the front desk resulted in...more beer served to the guy. There was trash right at the entrance to the beach - a twelve-pack carboard container and a couple of coffee cups in plain view that were never picked up during my stay. Contrast this to the guy next door that rents the beach chairs, who spent almost an hour every day raking his entire area. It looked nice. Either his boss forced him to clean his area, or maybe he just took pride in his work, something that the beach staff at the pelicano don't do. Spotty service from the maids. Sometimes I didn't get water, sometimes I only got one towell. Still this is a pretty good little hotel for the price I paid. I think that everyone could agree that the owner really doesn't have to do anything to his property, other than make sure that his taxes are paid, and he'll still make his money when he sells. Too bad, the Pelicano could be first-rate, but it would take a blow-out of the current staff.", "Date": "April 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montana", "Title": "\u201cThird stay, wont go back.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4939388", "Content": "This was our third stay at the Pelicano in 4 years and have noticed a steady decline in all aspects of the hotel.

Many of the beach lounge chairs were broken and couldn't be used. It is the only facility that we have found that does not have beach towels available for guests. We were told by two different individuals that breakfast at the restaurant was included with our room (it wasn't). We received two threadbare bath towels each day - no wash clothes or hand towels. I asked - but was told that we could only have the two bath towels. There was only a thin sheet on the mattress and no mattress pad - ugh. There was never any hot (or even warm) water. The website said that hammocks were provided - they were not. It was interesting to see that only a very few guests used the restaurant or the bar at the Pelicano - the staff at both were us grumpy as those working at the front counter. Guests used the services at neighboring beach front hotels and were treated great. We didn't go the Pelicano expecting luxury - we enjoy adventure.
