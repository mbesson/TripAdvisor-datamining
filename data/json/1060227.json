We arrived dog tired at 5 am. It took the receptionist a couple of minutes to even look at me, he then denied they received the booking. I showed him the confirmation and he never accepted it, and instead offered a suite for an extra 75 derhams until the afternoon. We accepted, and while he was getting copies of our id's, a girl walked to the information desk, and he gave us the keys real quick and asked us in a very rude hand motion to go to what supposed to be a suite. When we walked into what we thoght a suite, it turned out to be the same exact room we booked!! We didn't want to go downstairs again as we were really tired. In the afternoon when we were going to check out, we asked to speak with the manager. After waiting for him for about 15 mins, he said that they actually received our booking, and apologised for the behaviour of the receptionist and said he had no right to be deceptive. He offered we stay there for another night, but one was more than enough. I said your apology is useless as long as you did not do anything about anything.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect central business hotel\u201d", "Author": "27kwai", "ReviewID": "UR119728101", "Content": "Clean, high standard central hotel.

It's about 7 mins walk to metro station and however it is located in the business district you can get to main malls, beaches and attracions in about 30 mins by taxi (not in the peak hour of traffic), metro, bus or shuttles. The nearest famous shopping mall is the deira city center which you can go there by the hotel shuttle or walk (about 20 mins walk). And if you want to have a guest in your room don't worry about additional costs (which some hotels in dubaicharge for it).

Wide selection of food at breakfast, don't forget to try the hommus and the mayonaise/cheese spread - its yummy. Everything is beef as its a muslim country, they even have bacon made out of beef. Swimming pool at the top - it is heated but outside pool. You can go to the top level at night and see some night view of Dubai. There is a bank close by for money exchange. Bring your own hairdryer, the hairdryer is very very weak, almost quicker leaving your hair to dry naturally!

It is infact closrer to the Airport then the actual drive it takes (This is can say as the Aircraft landing is clearly visible from the Roof Top). It is few blocks away from the Deira City Centre, one of the many mall in Dubai. Samaya's rates are similar to the any other Business Hotels in the Vicinty. The features are... It has a Health Club on the Top Floor (i think 17th Floor) and a small Swimming Pool on the Roof Top. The rooms are clean and nicely designed. The choice of amenities is smart and intelligent. The Restaurant serves a well layed out Continental Breakfast with a local touch (they serve Fresh Dates in the Breakfast) Another notable feature is the Shuttle bus service run by the Hotel to the nearest mall the Deira City Centre during the mornings and Evenings. To sum it up, I would say it is an ideal hotel for the ones who are Travelling on Business, like me.

I enjoyed each minute of my stay in the hotel. As mentioned by others, the standard rooms are not big, however very comfortable, the bathrooms are equipped with everything you would need, from toothbrush, hair conditioner, even with shoe polisher. The beds are very comfortable, the rooms are cleaned daily, or as you request. The only concern is the WIFI, which is free in the lobby, but quite expensive in the room. It's my firm believe that since Deira is the business part of Dubai, the Chamber of Commerce is just meters away, the could make even better business with a free WiFi offer for everyone. I ate in both restaurants, great breakfast, mixed arabian and continental food, excellent , lunch buffet and the Iranian restaurant in the evening puts the crone onto the culinary experience. The hotel personal is just 7 star, you can really not beat the service they offered, you are always asked if everything was ok, if they could help in anything, in the restaurants they are more than friendly, they are professionals, led by Raj Kiron, a very professional gentleman. I reccomend to try in the Iranian restaurant they special Iranian ice cream and the Iranian herb tea. They were something very special. My rating is that the hotel services are wrth of each penny you pay, except the Internet service. If I were them I would offer it for free.

I was completely happy with my selection. Let me tell you everything there is to know about why i chose this hotel. The hotel is only 10 minutes from Dubai International Airport and it cost about $7 US dollars to get to the hotel. The entranceo fo the hotel is very open, clean and extremely modern.. The front desk attendants were helpful and were able to check me in at 9am. I was very pleased after an 18 hour flight from San Francisco. The room I had was on the 7th floor and it was very nice and i will post pictures. The bathroom was big and the room had amazing clloset space. I had breakfast included and it was very good. It starts at 6 am and goes to 10am, Ih had all the items you could possibly need. I loved the way you get free bottled water in the room twice a day. You must go to the rooftop pool and it was really cool to see the city. I do have to say it was windy but on those hot days it felt great. I went to the gym and it had all the latest equipment. I would recommend taking the free shuttle to the Deira Beach. Its a very nice and safe beach with lots of things to do. The shuttle also goes to the city center which is this huge shopping area. I was not bored at all and felt very safe being alone. The hotel has three Lexus cars available for private tours and they charge by the hour and I did a tour that was prices at 550 dirham for 5 hours and I gave a 50 dirham tip. this is the best way to see the entire city in a day with a driver that will stop anywhere you want.", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Samaya Hotel Deira", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1060227-Reviews-Samaya_Hotel_Deira-Dubai.html", "Price": "$98 - $190*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Al Rigga</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">PO Box 88449</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1060227", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/a8/04/e8/samaya-hotel-deira.jpg"}}
