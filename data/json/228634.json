It was very good: modern and comfortable rooms with air conditioning and secondary glazing designed to keep the Ramblas noise out. The bed linen was changed daily. The hotel is well positioned, just below the Catalunya Square and reasonable walking distance from most main attractions, with a big market just a few hundred metres away. At present it has no bar but the staff kindly let us bring in wine to have a quiz evening in one of the lounges. Had it had this facility I would have rated the hotel as excellent: I understand that there are plans for one to be created. There are good restaurants all around and a friendly bar next door.

The staff was extremely friendly. Immediately I noticed the room is clean and modern deco! Many people will complain that the rooms are small but honestly....you really aren't in them that much! We were there for 4 nights and loved the convenience of the hotels location. We walked EVERYWHERE! Even took a run down an abandoned La Rambla one early morning. Few issues: they were doing some construction and it seemed to start VERY early in the morning and not let up ALL day. We had a weird odor in our room the first day but we didn't know if it was the construction or the area. After the first day we couldn't take it anymore....it was a sewage smell. We happened upon a staff member in the hall and he came in to smell and was astonished. They immediately moved us to their only room available...which was a bit bigger than the one we were in. I appreciate their quick response to the issue! I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a convenient, clean, and welcoming hotel in Barcelona.

My husband and I just had a very comfortable five night stay there. The rooms are modern, comfortable and clean. We had a standard double (don't go for the economy - these seem much too small for a couple). The double bed was nice and firm, but was just two singles pushed together. This didn't bother us, but could bother some people I suppose. The bathroom was well equipped with a shower/ tub combination and I found the water temperature and strength good. The location is perfect being right on the Ramblas. It is spitting distance from Catalunya Metro station. Many attractions, shops, restaurants and bars are within easy walking distance as the hotel is so central. We did not have breakfast at the hotel so I can't comment on this (12 Euro each seemed a little on the high side), but there is no need to have breakfast at the hotel as there are so many nice cafes nearby where you can get nice breakfast tortillas or pastries. (I would recommend Buenas Migas just around the corner) A lot of people on here have commented on the hotel being noisy. You do hear the occasional door open and close in the corridor and the toilet flush from other rooms, but it really isn't anywhere near as bad a some people have made out. In fact, we found it quite quiet and slept comfortably. Noise from the street is also fairly minimal. There are few services on site, but I knew this when I booked it. There is a restaurant underneath the hotel: nice food and convenient, but terribly slow service so I wouldn't necessarily recommend unless you really don't want to walk far! The staff seem friendly and helpful (although it was a shame that on checkout the man who served us said hardly a word to us - I would expect some sort of thank you and goodbye).

I mainly appreciated how central to everything this hotel was. Even thought located right along La Rambla, the noise was almost nonexistent when we had our windows closed. The biggest issue I had was that the hotel restaurant was under construction. You couldn't hear the noise from our room, but it sound pretty loud when the elevator passed from the third floor down. Also, this meant that the breakfast was served in alternate locations. For the first couple of mornings, we had to go across the street with vouchers to another hotel. Then, a small buffet was set up in the restaurant right next to the hotel. (Same building, but I don't think actually connected to the hotel.) Also, this meant there was no room service and food could not be brought back to the rooms. Obviously, you could purchase it elsewhere as takeout and bring it back, but it was inconvenient. On the other hand, there was a Carrefour about a block down, which was lovely for getting bottled water and snacks.

There are renovations works going on but, to be honest, they hardly affected anything at all and there was certainly no noise from them. Our room was clean, warm and comfortable although, for the price paid for the 3 of us at Euro 250 for 2 nights and Euro 260 for 2 nights, we had expected there to be proper beds. We had 1 double bed, a put up bed and a sofa bed. There are no facilities to make tea/coffee and we would really have expected this in a 4* hotel although there is a mini bar. So if you are looking for this you should book elsewhere or, alternatively, bring your own kettle for making hot drinks. We found the staff to be pleasant and friendly for the most part. There is a dining area within the hotel and the breakfasts offer a comprehensive selection of fresh buffet foods for diners. At Euro 12 per person (adults) and half that for children we found that, if you have a big appetite then that's good you can certainly get your 'money's worth', but for us with much smaller appetites going outside to find somewhere for breakfast would have been much more economical. I'm confused as to its 4* rating as my friends and I discussed this and felt that 3* would have been appropriate although we thought that the management thought that the central location would probably warrant it to a 4*. One thing you must check when leaving the hotel is that your bill is right. My friend had paid the first night on her credit card as soon as we booked the nights and, when our bill was printed out, they tried to charge us again for that first night. It took us twice of challenging that before the staff member would even look through the records. We were also charged full breakfast price although we had been told that we would receive a 15% discount if we breakfasted at the hotel. Again we had to challenge that.

We pretty much just used the hotel as somewhere to sleep and shower so the Royal Ramblas was perfect for us. My biggest tip is to get the Aerobus from the Airport to Barcelona. The buses leave from outside the terminal every 6 mins and drop you off at Placa De Catalunya which is the last stop. From here, head down the Ramblas and the hotel is on your right not far from the top. You can catch the bus back to the airport from where you're dropped off. A1 for Terminal 1 and A2 for T2 and costs \u00a35.30 each way. We used to get fresh juice and fruit from Mercat de La Boqueria - they do most juices you can think of from kiwi fruit to strawberry.

The reception area of the Royal was newly renovated and seemed more open and pleasant then the last time. While the front desk staff were charming and helpful, service was still painfully slow both at checkout and check-in. The scaffolding was taken down during my stay. The newly renovated restaurant next door looked promising. We were given breakfast vouchers for their sister property across the road in the morning \u2013 I only tried it once, as it really wasn\u2019t very good (especially if you are a vegetarian). I had a room on the 6th floor, overlooking Las Ramblas. The room was literally twice as big as I had on my previous stay (at the same enormous price) and I even had a full bathroom on this occasion. I would certainly avoid the basic / economy rooms at all cost. There were a few problems. For example, I can\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t join the two single beds into one, as I kept falling between the cracks (as the two beds are on wheels). Many of my colleagues also complained about this. The bed was also rock-hard and very uncomfortable, but the pillows were fine. The rooms could really do with irons. I borrowed the iron on the first night and I think it was the only one for the entire building. The hotel rooms could also benefit with a kettle in each room. The other thing about the room, which also drove me a little nuts, was the fact that the air conditioning system had not been turned on yet. You could open the windows to get some fresh air, but then you could hear all of the street noise. For the price we were paying, this was not really acceptable. The bathroom was a good size with large towels and okay to weak water-pressure. The soap provided was too small, but they also gave out shampoo and body wash, as well as toothbrush, hair cap, razer and tissues. I would suggest bringing your own amenities as I did. The room was reasonably cleaned during my 6-night stay, however, when I came back at 3:00 p.m. on the last day, the room had not been cleaned. I popped out for a couple of hours (and put the \u201cplease clean sign\u201d on my door) and it still had not been serviced by 5:15 p.m. I pleaded with the staff to remedy the situation as soon as possible, but it was not what I needed after a long week at La Fira. The best thing about this property is the location, but you will pay through the nose for the privilege of an okay, but not spectacular 3-star property (3-star by North American standards by the way).

I was apprehensive about the hotel we would be staying at but once we arrived at the hotel I was pleasantly surprised. The decor of the hotel is gorgeous and very modern. The room we had was the ramblas view superior room. The view from the window was perfect as we could see the main street. The room was very spacious and clean and the decor again was fabulous. I was really happy with the hotel and the room my partner had chosen. The location of the hotel is perfect, its situated directly on la rambla and the main square is about 5 minutes walking distance. Everything was accessible to us and we could walk directly to the shops and restaurants situated close by. The metro bus stop was less than 5 minutes walk away which made it convenient to get a bus to the airport on our departure. The bus is priced very reasonably at just under 6 euros per person which is a lot cheaper than getting a taxi! The staff at the hotel were mostly friendly and willing to help us with directions and places to eat. We found that on our arrival there was renovation work taking place for the design rooms which are being built on the royal floor situated on the PR floor. However we hardly noticed the drilling and the cleaners were nice enough to close the doors in the hallway to shield us from hearing the drilling. The hotel personally made my stay in Barcelona very enjoyable and I loved the liveliness of the square and observing from our room window. Another plus point was the supermarket which was situated downstairs a few doors down from the hotel, which made it easy and convenient to get hold of anything we needed. There was a wide range of restaurants including kfc and mcdonalds which were situated right of the hotel within a 5 minute walk however be warned that you will be ripped off trying to buy a meal from these popular chains! Another word of warning is to steer clear of side streets as they are narrow and dark and move away from the main street. We wandered down these side streets unaware, in search of a nice bar to watch the football however immediately felt unsafe with the type of people on these side streets, so be cautious. There are a wide array of shops and stalls situated on the main street and a place called Patagonia Bar where we had our last meal. When we first arrived at this place we felt it lacked atmosphere and that staff were not friendly and in particular the waitress, however the main young guy at the bar who appeared to be the owner provided a fun and friendly atmosphere and gave us 4 free shots between us along with all of the other people at the bar. So be sure to give this place a chance. Whenever there is a football match, which in our case there was, (Barcelona v Real Madrid) the atmosphere is crazy and amazing, we saw fans parading outside our hotel on the main street and chanting till the early hours of the morning, however we slept peacefully thanks to the solid sound proofed windows. This atmosphere is noisy but amazing and unlike anything you have ever seen. Shopping in Barcelona is great as they have more choice than the UK and clothes are very affordable and pretty cheap I found. I found the Zara's there were great. There are a lot of Zara shops around the square and as you walk left of the hotel along with other well known retailers such as Diesel, Levis, Esprit and H&M. However as I learnt the hard way, there is a lot of walking so take a lot of flat comfy shoes and especially ladies do not attempt to wear heals as by then end of your trip your feet will be very sore and the streets are not friendly to walk in heels. On our second day we decided to take the 'Barcelona Bus Turistic' bus tour which consisted of a blue and red route (and a green route however this is only for the summer months). Each route takes approximately 2 hours providing you don't get off at any of the stops. You are able to get on and off at any of the stops and look around etc and simply hop on the next bus which comes every 7 - 20 mins. We found this bus tour great as we saw all of the major attractions and felt like we saw quite a lot of Barcelona. We saw the famous Sagrada Familia which is an amazing architectural creation by the artist Gaudi and we also saw numerous creations of his along with a stop which was located on the red route which allowed us to get off at a view point where there was a museum but more importantly a breathtaking view of Barcelona, so be sure to get off here to take pictures. This tour is 24 euros per person for both routes and the bus stop is situated conveniently less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel, situated on the main square, which is the same area to catch the metro bus from. On our last day when we checked out, the hotel reception staff were kind and kept our suitcases for us until we left in the evening and we were able to sit in the hotel lobby area. So finally to sum up our stay, we had an amazing 2 nights and 3 days at this hotel and in this beautiful city and we were sad to go!", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Larnaca, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cWonderful location and suprisingly beautiful rooms\u201d", "Author": "charlesp", "ReviewID": "UR123589919", "Content": "Three minutes from the airport bus stop and the metro and directly on the Rambla.

To make matters even worst the light is controlled by a motion sensor so keep moving if you don\u2019t want the light to turn itself off. Moreover, you have to step into the main room to wash your hands or to dry yourself after taking a shower. The main attraction of this hotel is its proximity to La Ramblas so in reserving an economy room I did not expect a beautiful street view but I did not expect either that our windows would open on dark inner airway shaft. Everything is small in this hotel; the complementary toiletries are not enough for two people. The elevators, for a hotel this size, are so small and in high demand so a lot of guests have to take the stairs instead. The hotel restaurant seems to be a variation of a fast food restaurant chain. All in all, from what I saw in this hotel it is definitely not a 4 stars hotel. Maybe the others types of room are somewhat better but they are a lot more expensive. In my view, if you want to be recognized as a 4 stars hotel all rooms should have a minimum level of comfort and services.

On arrival the first time after a long flight from Australia, at 9.30am we were told our room was not ready but for 10 euro we could upgrade to a 'superior' room which was immediately available. We took this option and were quite happy with the room, which was clean, modern and overlooked La Ramblas, yet there was no street noise. Note there was no hair conditioner, coffee making facilities or internet in the room but a large TV with English news channels. Staff were pleasant. Negatively, the fire escape was not an enclosed or pressured stairwell but merely stairs in the middle of the hotel. After the cruise, the room we had booked was ready but we wished we had again upgraded. This room was very small, overlooked a wall and appeared designed for maximum electricity saving. The shower and toilet were separated by a frosted glass wall and shared a frosted glass sliding door across the front, so that only one could be closed off at a time. (Water from the shower leaked out into the basin area and also over the floor of the toilet, which we had to dry up. ) They also shared a light which was over the toilet and extremely bright. So far ok, except that the light was movement activated only. It went on when you entered the toilet, stayed on for about 10 seconds and then went off. You had to wave you hand or wiggle the sliding door if you wanted it to come on again. Of course it lit up again when you left the cubicle. Still ok: the problem was it did this when you passed too close to the door and during the night also. If you had to make a visit to the toilet during the night, you could not do so in the dark. This bright light went on and lit up the whole room ...guaranteed to wake a sleeping spouse. With us both having to make a couple of such trips, we found our sleep very disturbed. We could have stopped it by taking the card out of the electricity slot, but then that would have meant putting the light on to reset the heater Then our neighbours arrived home about 4 am with much chatter and door banging....the room was not soundproof! All in all it was very poor preparation for our long flight home, and would perhaps better suit young people who may not need to visit the toilet during the night.

While it was better than I expected, I would not use my own money to stay there again. GOOD POINTS: The best thing about this hotel was the location. It is very central on Las Ramblas and close to lots of shops and restaurants. Don\u2019t bother with the mini-bar in your room, just turn right out of the hotel and there is a Carrefour grocery store within a 3-minute walk. Renovations were good and the hotel had an overall clean, crisp feel. Duvet and pillows on the bed were fine. There was a satellite TV on the wall with lots of Spanish Freeview channels, plus a smattering of foreign channels on satellite. Shower strength was good and my room included complimentary shower gel, mini-soap, shampoo, moisturiser, toothbrush, shower-cap, shoe sponge, sewing kit and slippers (ladies take note \u2013 no hair conditioner and quality of products was poor). Front-desk staff were friendly. All of my wake-up calls were timely. Housekeeping did a good job. For a European hotel, the breakfast was very good. Lots of choice and the coffee was excellent. I felt safe in the hotel, although you must be careful in Barcelona, as pick pocketing is rampant. BAD POINTS: This was probably the noisiest hotel I have stayed in for years. The walls were paper-thin and you could hear EVERYTHING that your neighbour was doing (both next-door and above). Door slamming in the morning was also a huge problem for a restful night. However, I never heard any street noise. I found the bed quite uncomfortable, possibly due to the slippy, plastic, under-sheet (no worry about critters). It was also very hard. My colleagues who purchased the WiFi said that it never worked properly. My room was tiny and I only had a shower (not a bath and shower, like some of my colleagues had for the same price). It was fine if travelling single, but way too small for a couple. It reminded me of an Ibis hotel, but three times more expensive. As it was Mobile World Congress week, we paid twice as much for our rooms. Horrible value-for-money at 300 Euros a night. The price dropped to 120 a night on the shoulder dates, which I still thought was over-priced for the quality (but I guess we were also paying for the location). It was perfectly adequate with an excellent location \u2013 now I just have to catch up on the lost sleep.

The economy room is fairly comfortable but be prepared for a very odd bathroom configuration. This layout reminded me of a cruise ship accommodations and the size was just slightly larger than most cabins. Also, the bed was a bit short, so if you're tall your feet will hang off the edge. The oddest feature is the fact that the toilet and shower are not in a separate room but are right next th the bed. Each has it's own sliding partition and the lights go on when you move the door. The the lights make a beeping sound to remind you to close the door. This could annoy some. In addition, the sink sits near the door and it's not easy to keep water from spilling onto the floor of the room. Everything works fine but be aware there is very little privacy with this setup.

There are prostitutes and persons of dubious character found in the alleys and squares. That said, we walked through with no problems, just a little quicker than normal. Police are everywhere, just be assertive with the street sellers, keep walking and smiling and you should be fine. We were. The other item worth noting is the smoking.

If you are traveling with kids make sure you request the family plan. The rooms were great. Very trendy - my kids just loved the European decor there. Very nice and spacy for a hotel in Europe with this plan. The bathrooms were great. Nice large tub with jets which were nice especially after walking all day long and big shower. We didn't have any problem with the maids bothering us if we wanted to sleep in as some former person posted. Just make sure you put a sign on your door if you. Restaurant attached for the breakfast was not very good. I would opt to go somewhere else and get a much better one!

Better end of Las Ramblas, 5th floor superb views of street entertainment, extremely comfortable beds and bedding - on par with Sheraton Hotels. Superbly soundproofed, very clean and reception staff are professional and very polite. Breakfast buffet not be the best in the world but there's something for everyone and it's very reasonably priced by comparison to other eateries in the area. Evening restaurant was run at a hectic pace and had very limited vegetarian option so only visited it once. Service was very disappointing and as there's an enormous range of bars and restaurants within walking distance that serve cheaper and better food it's probably better to go elsewhere. Internet charges of 7 euros for 30 minutes are steep for slow connection. The cleaners do a good job but like to start early even if you hang the \"do not disturb\" sign up, no chance of staying in bed any later than 8.00 am as you're either woken by the noise of cleaning or a knock on the door to tell you they're ready to clean. Not really a bad thing as there is so much to see and do either by foot, bus touristic, bike tour or segway, it also means you don't need to set an alarm or miss the breakfast buffet which seems to be very popular even with people from outside the hotel. Beware the taxi service to the airport. When checking with reception we were told the taxi is \"about 28 euros however can be more depending on luggage\". We weren't entirely sure what that would mean for 2 small weekend cases and were no clearer when the taxi driver decided to round up our metered reading of 31 euros to 40 euros. At 4am in the morning we were just glad to have arrived at the airport in one piece considering the speed at which the motorway bends were taken! I would recommend this hotel, and I agree it should be referred to as The Royal as that is the name at the front that we walked past when looking for Royal Ramblas.

The bus in took about 25 minutes, when we went back on Sunday light traffic meant that the journey only took 15 - 20 mins. A note to all Easyjet travellers the bus lets you off at T2B but you must walk about 500 metres on to the T2C terminal where all the easyjet check ins are. Then when you are checked in you have to walk about 750 metres back up inside the terminal building. It's a long walk for the able bodied so if you have any motability problems beware ! We checked into the hotel and i asked for a room with a street view as the hotel sits directly on La Rambla with all its activity and acts. We wre kindly given a room on the third floor overlooking the street. Great. Thank you Royal Rambla!. The room was fine, apparently recently renovated, with wall tv, double bed, mini bar, en suite etc. The safe was complemetary which i thought was a nice touch. No trouble with deposits or charges. Room was fine. We booked B/B which was reasonable, but always crowded as the staff only opened a small portion of the room at a time, which meant that guests were cheek by jowl all the time. I suppose they only wanted to have to clean and tidy a small part rather than the whole restaurant but it managed to ruin our breakfast Travelled to Monserrat by train (stopping at so many stations on the way), took the train up and the cable car down (never again - sooo scary). It was misty on our day at Monserrat but still a beautiful place!. But that cable car, never again! Took the open top Touristic bus around the city was quite expensive but a great way to see all the city. Watched the 'Find the Lady' gang from my hotel room window. Amazing . I counted seven in the gang - two lookouts at street corners - one player - and four fake players each moving in a carefully choreographed way - making bids and winning of course - until the innocent player joins in and taken for 50 euro than all scatter - only to meet up again some time later. Prices are so expensive along La Rambla, so holding tightly onto our possessions wec went off the beaten track and enjoyed much better value in food and drink.

During our stay, the hotel was under massive renovation, with holes punched in the ceiling of the lobby, workmen on ladders, wires dangling from hallway ceilings, and the smell of paint very common in the mornings. We were out most of the day, and the bulk of the work seems to be over by 5:00 PM each day, so this was a minor inconvenience; however, we felt that, since we made our reservations directly with the hotel, the staff should have mentioned the construction issues to us. That said: our rooms on the first floor had very recently been renovated, and were spacious and well-appointed. The bathrooms are huge by European standards, and the blackout curtains and double double-paned windows (that's not a typo, by the way -- the rooms feature inner and outer windows, both of which can be opened), so we heard little street noise, even on New Year's Eve. The staff is chilly in general -- you won't receive a sunny welcome from anyone, and there's no flexibility at all in check-in time or room selection. But when our father grew ill and had to stay in one evening, they did respond very quickly and kindly to our request for a platter of bread and butter for him (the only food he could bear to think of eating) ... and didn't charge us a thing. The rooms can be booked with breakfast included. The primary benefit of dining in the attached restaurant is convenience. The spread is the same every day: chocolate breads and sweet cakes, breads, cured meats, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, fruit, toast, coffee, and juice. The price runs around 10 euros; keep in mind that, with dozens of great little pastry shops and coffee houses nearby, you can probably get a better breakfast for about the same price if you don't mind a morning walk before eating. WiFi is available, but the prices are high, with the hotel charging about $40.00 US for three days or 10$ for 45 non-continuous minutes. Unless in-room WiFi is critical, save money, walk down the street one and one-half block, and get WiFi for the price of a coffee at the local Starbucks. This all sounds more negative than it should.

We booked a Family room on the Royal floor, as we were are family of 2adults and 3 children. Please note that the bedding for this room for a family of this size is a king bed (two twin beds joined as most hotels) and a double sofa bed). On our request the hotel added a rollway which is not normal hotel policy but wanted to make sure that all of our children were comfortable and we thank them for that. We arrived before the normal check in time and were advised that our room was ready and waiting and we could check straight in. Our room was spotless it was modern and it was very comfortable for our family. The Royal floor also has a room called the Salon which has magazines and books to read, tea and water for us to drink whenever we wanted and tables and chairs for relaxing in a space other than your room. The bathroom was spotless with all expected amenities. Wi-Fi is available in the hotel, if you need to bring your laptop there is a charge but this is not any more expensive than any other european hotel we have stayed at. The staff at this hotel went out of their way to make sure that our check in and check out was as smooth as could be and if a question was asked they would do their utmost to make sure everything was done for you. Their service was fantastic and some of the best we have experienced. The hotel is in a fantastic location on La Rambla only 100m from the Aerobus express transfer service from the airport (dont bother with expensive transfers this is cheap and quick) and right in the middle of all the excitment of the centre of town. Placa Catalunya is 2min from the front door and from here you will pick up the buses for any day tours you may take and also for the hop on hop off bus. The Metro stop is also just a little up from the hotel and a good way to get around town. Port Vell is at the other end of La Ramblas, you will enjoy the walk down past all the street performers, without stopping it will take you 10min, with stopping well it could take you all day. The hotel is surrounded by restaurants and shopping is right at this hotels door. The only thing i disliked about the hotel was the breakfast on offer, the restaurant lets the hotel down but you have the choice to eat or not eat there and we took up both those choices.

Only steps from the Placa Catalunya, which is the most central place for designer shopping and Las Ramblas.

Only complaint was the bed was very hard, and given that this was the most expensive category of room, would have expected differently. Hotel staff speaks great English and is happy to help with finding your way around and booking tours.

Restaraunt option - try Bello Italy on Las Ramblas for a good Italian meal with great personal service. Same side of street as hotel, about a 5 min walk toward the Columbus Monument.

I had done my research and read some negative reviews claiming noise, poor service and other problems, but not once did I encounter any of these problems. The staff was excellent, spoke english and responded quickly to any request -- even the 5 am taxi request for our departure.

A 4 minute walk to Placa Cataluna to pick up the Hop-on/off tourist bus, the subway or shopping.

HOTEL/CONCIERGE: The hotel was ok, we were served a nice buffet breakfast and they had all kinds of typical and standard international breakfast dishes.

We didn't have breakfast included in our price but one morning when we wanted some tea and couldn't get into the lounge area on the Royal Floor as it was booked for a meeting, they told us to get it from the dining room. The breakfast looked very plentiful and fresh so it might be a bit pricey but there seemed to be a lot of choice. The staff in the restaurant were also very friendly and helpful. We would definately recommend this hotel and would definately stay here again. As far as location goes you can't get any better. You are right on La Ramblas which is always buzzing. Within 10 minutes walk you can get to the port. You must go and see the magic fountain (free). Be aware of pick pockets. Read the reviews and the scams around. Keep valuables out of sight!!!

We had booked a double superior room and were given a very small, dark and gloomy twin room with very small single beds(the lights had to be on all the time) Room 101 (!!!) overlooking Las Ramblas. We were checked in late at night after a long journey by an efficient but unfriendly member of staff. We didnt complain about the room that evening as it was late and we just wanted to go to bed. The next morning we were woken up with the sound of banging from above our beds. After a long, hot day in Barcelona we returned to our room to have a rest before heading off for a special meal for my birthday. No sooner had we put our feet up and the drilling and banging started and this went on for several hours. When we could stand it no more we left the hotel (at 7.35 pm) despite our restaurant booking not being until 9pm. I had been down to reception to request that we change rooms (to a double room as booked and to a quieter location) and to ask about the noise. I was told by a very rude male receptionist ( he answered the telephone interrupting our conversation and didnt bother to apologise after he continued speaking to someone else for several minutes )that I should ask in the morning as there was nothing he could do that evening and that the noise was due to the third floor being renovated and some problems with the water pressure and the drilling, banging etc did not start until 10 am each day and finished by 6.30 pm. Both of these facts were untrue. It is clearly unacceptable to still be making this amount of noise during the evening when guests are returning to the hotel and have paid a lot of money to stay in this location, in what is after all meant to be a 4 star hotel with a price tag to match. This receptionist then merely shrugged his shoulders at me when I told him that we were not informed that building work was taking place at the hotel when we had booked only a week before as we would not have considered paying this amount of money to have this noise the whole time you were in the room. I was really upset by his attitude and went back to the room very angry and tearful .Even something small such as the offer of complimentary breakfasts to make up for the noise would have gone a long way to making up for the inconvenience and upset that we had encountered.

The room itself was very nice (it could have used more drawers for clothing) and the bathroom was nice too.

In our opinion it should only just scrape a 3 star rating. The hotel is bland and unwelcoming although the reception and housekeeping staff were friendly. There are absolutely no facilities within the hotel so you really are just paying for a room. The tv was old and could only pick up one English speaking channel - CNN. We appreciate that you don't go away on a city break to watch tv but it's nice to have the option as it is a facility advertised and one which you are paying for after all. If you like to iron your clothes before an evening out, take a travel iron as the hotel does not have one you can use. Also take a travel kettle as the rooms do not have tea/coffee making facilities. The adjoining 'restaurant' was expensive and the menu limited and unimaginative especially for vegans/vegetarians. The pizzas look better than they taste and the complimementary olives tasted stale. The salad consisted of a handful of mixed leaves and half a tomato! Overall, we would not recommend this hotel and will not be returning to Barcelona. Apart from some nice architecture, the city is dirty, overcrowded and really you could be in any other city in Europe... plenty of Starbucks, Mc Donald's and Burger King's if that's your thing. We were particularly upset to see caged birds of all varieties for sale along Las Ramblas and the pet shops were also archaic selling puppies on show in glass fronted cages.

Our hotel room was freezing cold, colder inside than out, it seemed. I called the front desk to make sure I was operating the A/C correctly and was instructed over the phone what settings to put it on. The room was still freezing the next day, so someone came up and told me that I had actually turned the thing off. I don't think either was correct because I tried every possible setting, the temp was as high as I could set it, and our room was cold the entire time. 2. The wireless internet is expensive, 15 euro per day per computer. I paid for the internet and yet I couldn't get a signal. The front desk did rectify this problem by sending me up some big clunky antenna. It worked, but still annoying. When using a laptop, the less wires the better, right? 3. The hotel room was very mediocre. It was not 4 stars and definitely not worth the price. The room was boring. I'm not super into decor or anything, but it was basically furnished like a Motel 6 or something. It was clean, but very basic. The television was old and didn't work properly.

There is so much to see and do in Barcelona - La Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia (both must see's). We navigated our way around using both the metro and bus system. Fairly simple and saves on taxis. If you walk straight down Las Ramblas, heading to the beach you will come across Maremagnum. A self contained entertainment complex of shops, bars and restaurants with lovely views out to sea and the harbour area. We spent our last night there. Very nice relaxed atmosphere. A great end to a great holiday. Drinks wise, stay off of Las Ramblas. A pint and a JD and coke came to 19 euros in a bar on the main drag.

Their pizzas were OK, pastas not too good, but surprisingly, their paella was pretty good. \u2022Elevators were always readily waiting on the ground floor. \u2022There are lots of good restaurant nearby, but best to choose one on the side streets off Las Ramblas (because of price and quality) \u20223-5 minute walk to Boqueria market \u2022Convenience store a few doors down. We bought our water and soda there when lines weren\u2019t excessively long as they tend to be in the later afternoon. Cons: \u2022Although rooms were sound-proof from the noise on the streets, there was constant noise from the restaurant below, which you could clearly hear from our rooms (#8, 9 and 11) You can hear them moving chairs around, vacuuming and generally moving things around until 2am. Other reviewers mentioned this as well. \u2022Some nights were so busy on Las Ramblas that it was a chore just to walk through the crowds. Hotel staff said this is typical of weekend nights. \u2022Staff was cordial, but not very helpful. They did not offer restaurant recommendations, but rather, gave me a map with restaurants shown. I asked for their personal preferences in the area and was told on 2 occasions that most of the restaurants are good \u2013 they just didn\u2019t say which ones! \u2022Had to have our keys for the family suite re-programmed 3 times. Reception was apologetic, but did not know why this was occurring. \u2022There is no coffee/tea service in the room. There\u2019s a Royal Salon for those staying on the Royal Floor which provides tea service but the Salon opens at 8am or 8:30 or 9am \u2013 depending when staff decides to open up. I asked the front desk about this, but they said it should open at 7:30am. You can, instead, grab some coffee in the breakfast room which opens at 7:30 or purchase in the machine in the lobby for one euro. So, if you\u2019re an early riser, like me, you\u2019ll have to wait for your morning beverage!There\u2019s no concierge or phone book available.

The location is perfect. It's at the top of Las Ramblas, about 150m from the Placa de Catalunya and around 400m from the Liceu metro station (which is about half way down Las Ramblas). The main tourist buses leave from Placa de Catalunya and a number of metro and train lines intersect there. The hotel is also 40m away from the 'Champion' supermarket on Las Ramblas. If you don't want to pay hotel minibar prices or fancy a quick snack you can just nip to the supermarket (although you won't be short of places to eat on Las Ramblas). We bought bottles of water from the supermarket (19 cents each) and stocked our minibar with those - althought that probably annoyed the maid! Overall, we were happy with the hotel although we had a couple of minor issues (see below). We found the staff helpful and professional. The room was clean with a view over Las Ramblas, although the decor was slightly dated in the room we had. The TV had the usual satellite fare (ie. apart from the Spanish channels it was one channel per language). The safe was electronic. The rooms are very well sound-proofed and even thought it's the busiest street in Barcelona we could hardly hear a thing. Although the service had a few personal touches (eg. the porter taking the bags up to the room), it seems to be a hotel that focuses on professional rather than personal service. Having a room with a view over Las Ramblas cost an extra 20 Euro's per night but we thought it was worth it. The street is busy until late into the night with a variety of performing artists. After returning from sightseeing (between 7 and 8pm) and before going out for dinner (sometime after 9.30pm) we would just sit and just watch the street. We had 2 minor issues. When we first arrived we were put into a smoking room (when we had booked a non-smoking room). It stank, as almost all smoking rooms do. It also had a connecting door to the adjacent room and we could hear everything that was going on. We immediately asked to move to a different room and we were moved as soon as an appropriate room had been prepared (which was about 10 minutes). When we arrived in the new room it was much better although it had no toiletries.

The location was brilliant, the hotel is at the Placa de Catalunya (where all of the tourist and airport buses leave from) end of La Rambla, which was a safer and nicer area after midnight. Barcelona itself is a great place for a holiday, totally recommend the tourist bus - definitely worth the money. Also be sure to visit Montserrat - outstanding sight and worth the trip. The aquarium is too expensive for the twenty minute walk around it. Visit both Gaudi houses, as La Predrera is worth seeing for the roof and Casa Batllo for the apartment.

We had booked our reservation via internet; the Long stay promotion 4 nights & more, and had decided to splurge and book their twin Design Room on the Royal Floor. The pictures and comments do not lie. You do have a view directly on La Ramblas, the place to be, with a very large window (double panes), therefore blocking all noises from this very, very busy street. The room was very modern, but not over the top, large marble shower, beds were very comfortable and everything was new & clean. Rooms on this floor, also included free internet access. As an added touch, only clients of this floor have access to the Royal Lounge where a selection of teas and sparking wine (yes it's true) , little black chocolates, a basket of apples and magazines are available from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. You can relax right there (where a few tables are set up) or bring your champagne flutes or cups to your own room. It was really a very enjoyable bonus. The Royal Hotel is indeed very close to Plaza Cataluyna where the touristic buses & the metro are located. By the way, it is an excellent way to visit Barcelona as you can hop on & off to visit the sights. The city is so big, that we were very happy to have taken the 48-hour pass (24 hour is also available). The Royal Hotel is very, very centrally located- close to the Gothic quarters, side streets full of charm, shops, restos, down the street is the Port & Marina. And what to say of La Ramblas! Alive ! Restaurant terrasses, very creative street performers, shops, flower stands, theaters... Needless to say, if you do not like crowds, stay away. However, if you like to be right-smack in the action and stay in A-1 hotel, then the Royal Hotel is the place to stay!!! We were very satisfied and will recommend this hotel to all our friends and family. Before we left we asked to view one of their regular, standard rooms, and must say they also seemed very comfortable with tradtional Spanish style furniture. Same double-pane windows - good size rooms, clean, large bathrooms. One thing did surprise us as this is truly a 4-star hotel - there was no lobby-bar. It really didn't bother us that much. However, it would definitely be a plus for the hotel instead of their vending machines. They were, however, in the midst of opening a wall from the hotel right into the Poma restaurant, so I guess it may kind-of solve this little inconvenience. A five minute walk will take you to a little jewel of a restaurant we found - the L'Oliva on Calle Jovellanos where the food was excellent, really not expensive, service great. Their salmon al cava cooked in a sparking wine was to die for. It literally melted in your mouth. Please note they are closed on Sundays - we very disappointed cause we really wanted to go back.

When and why we stayed: My wife, son and I stayed at the Hotel Royal for 2 nights in March 2006. We were in the city as my son and I had tickets for the Barcelona versus Deportivo football match (Barca won 3:2). Cost: We booked the hotel with flights and match tickets from expedia. Room: The room and furnishing were old but most importantly clean and quiet. The beds were very comfortable and we all slept well. The bathroom was spacious with a combined bathtub and shower. The room also had a TV and table & chairs. There was also a minibar but we didn\u2019t use it as the supermarket nearby (turn right out of the hotel\u2019s front door then walk for a minute) was much cheaper for water (\u20ac0.30 for 1.5 litres) and beer (San Miguel \u20ac0.60 for half a litre). There is a free to use safe in the wardrobe. As we booked a triple room we were unable to obtain a room with a La Rambla view \u2013 these are doubles. The Hotel: The staff are friendly and when we when requested help to access our safe we received prompt assistance. We didn\u2019t eat the hotel\u2019s \u20ac13 breakfast as there are much cheaper options nearby. La Nurnia (turn left out of the hotel\u2019s front door then walk for 2 minutes towards Placa Catalunya and the restaurant is on the left) was very good and served reasonably priced set menus. Location: Perfect. The hotel is at the top of La Rambla, near Placa Catalunya, which is a major transport hub with a Metro and railway station as well as stops for buses. There are dozens of restaurants and bars nearby. The 9th floor caf\u00e9/restaurant in the El Cortes Ingles department store in Placa Catalunya is a marvellous spot to chill out over a coffee whilst you admire the magnificent city panorama there is a Starbucks near the hotel, at Ramblas 109. The Jules Verne bar a few doors away (towards Placa Catalunya) shows live English and Spanish football. The city: Barcelona is one of the great cities of the world. It is: cosmopolitan; alive; happening and radical. There\u2019s lots to see and do. A visit to the Camp Nou is a must. Our visit for a match was memorable \u2013 a tremendous spectacle with outstanding exciting football played. If there isn\u2019t a match on you can tour the stadium and visit the club\u2019s museum. The Bus Tur\u00edstic is a great way to see the city\u2019s main sites if you are short of time. The Tourist Bus has 44 stops along three routes: Northern Route (red), Southern Route (blue) & Forum Route (green) You can get on and off as many times as you like along the journey. The nearest stops to the hotel are in. Placa Catalunya A one-day ticket costs \u20ac18 or \u20ac22 for two days.

Do not eat Tapas on La Rambla or any food for that matter as it is extremely expensive and crap.

There was no view from our room (we looked onto a white wall that was about 5 feet away from our window), the room was musty and dark and the decor is very old and dank. The hotel is well-located in the heart of La Rambla, but this did not compensate for the poor upkeep and style of the hotel. The hotel lobby and reception desk are fine (although the photos make them look nicer than they actually are), but once you head up to your room, it is all downhill. I would strongly recommend finding another hotel in Barcelona because there are many with better value and better cleanliness. I would not even recommend this hotel to budget travellers or students, since it is relatively expensive.

You can walk the Ramblas at night and be close to home, jump on the metro at any time (its only a block away).

Our room faced the Ramblas and although we could still hear the fireworks and M-80's being lit off, with my ear plugs, I still got some sleep. They have a wonderful lobby, great doormen, good service and very very clean facilities. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. On the negative side (there always is one), they make you sign an agreement when you use a charge card to accept their conversion rate. Our 88E dinner in their adjoining restaurant turned into $250 US. That seemed like a bit much. But you're pretty much stuck when it comes to their credit card policy. My advice: stick to cash and travelers cheques. There is a cash machine right across the Ramblas from the hotel that you can use. In addition, the thermostat in our room never seemed to work correctly. We wanted it cooler and it wouldn't go below 25C no matter how low we set it. There is a great grocery store a few doors down the street. Don't miss the downstairs in the grocery store: 3.3 Euros for a litre of Sangria, .5 Euro for a baquette, 2 Euro for some cheese and .20 Euro for desserts.

We stayed in two rooms, both overlooking the Ramblas on the 5th and 6th floor, and had barely any noise from the streets below. The aircon worked a treat and the mini bar came in handy. One minor fault is that the lifts broke down on a couple of occasions which meant a bit of a walk to the upper floors, but it helped work the Tapas's off! We were lucky enough to see Barcelonas last league game of the season (incredible experience if you get the chance) and the hotel looked after and stored our tickets from the agency (Barcelona-football-tickets.) without any problems.

First of all you just will not get a better located hotel in barcelona. Its about 100 yards from the Placa de catalunya and right on the famous Ramblas.

You are within walking distance to the beautiful and lively marina. Not only that the hop on hop off tourist bus is again located just a minute away. And so to the hotel.

The staff are friendly and the hotel is clean. The room was small and unfortunetly for some strange reason we got two single beds pushed together in our double room which made things a bit uncomfortable. I'm not sure if this is the case in every room. One important factor is that the walls are paper thin and you can hear virtually everything in your neighbours room. The Ramblas is heaving from morning to night but when the windows are closed you cant hear a thing (except your neighbours). Watch out for those windows as they open fully and have a low ledge!
