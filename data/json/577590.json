Its close to this popular mall, I think it's called the farmers grove. Spent some time there while they were filming television show. Saw that guy from Saved by the Bell and just missed seeing a Kardasian. \u00a0Not sure which one. The rooms at \u00a0bungalow are very \u00a0good. There are 6 beds in my room and a large kitchen, so it feels like another room to hang out with a modern TV. There were many parties at night, it was a little loud but it was Saturday. I went with the group to \u00a0three different night clubs, wished I'd stayed at the first one, but it was good to see different things. I don't have any really bad things to say about Banana Bungalow. The staff was very helpful and know \u00a0everything to do in the city. I didn't go to the downtown, but everything else I did. The price was also very good, and there is a free breakfast, and you can buy more food for cheap if you like. I will love to come back again.

The Vibe Hotel - it's really a motel - turned out to be a halfway decent choice. It's not in the greatest part of town, but the streets are all well lit, so my wife and I were comfortable walking to and from the motel even late at night. It's a little over a mile walk to hollywood and highland and mann's Chinese theater. The rate for a private room was $89 (+3 using a credit card). Any additional taxes/fees were included in the $89. The room itself was pretty small, but was reasonably clean. To my surprise, it included a microwave, fridge and, get this, a bunk bed. The room already had a queen size bed. Maybe this is why the room seemed so small. The bed was comfy enough. Contrary to some other reviews, the staff was very friendly. The Thai restaurant next door is supposed to be good. And there's a Tommy's Burger a block away! From what I saw, most of the other guests were young europeans. A cereal and toast breakfast is included. Additionally, the night we were there, there was a BBQ with free beer and a dj. We missed it because of our concert, so I can't comment. There were free Internet stations everywhere. I didn't have any issues with noise, but I'm a heavy sleeper. With the younger crowd and the Hollywood blvd location, I could see how noise could be a potential problem.

We were running late the day of arrival so I gave them a call to let them know we'd be there, but then I was told that our room had been given away and we were moved to The Orbit (sister hotel of the Vibe) on the other side of Hollywood!! I specifically wanted the Vibe because it was within walking distance of a festival we were going to. We never received any phone call about the change and were told that they had no paper work for us. We straight up told them that this was bad management and insisted that we receive a free night for the mishap. Free night was out of the question and we were in fact turned away and told that we were not welcomed! We stayed at a miserable hotel on the first night (The Townehouse on Sunset), and then stayed at Magic Castle on Franklin Ave, which was wonderful and I really recommend them if you want a comfortable stay.

Not really knowing anything about LA before getting here. West Hollywood is a good hour walk to Hollywood and over an hour to the beach. Wish I had know that when I was booking this hostel.

(Check out the reviews under both names!) I booked a \"premium private room\" (with a kitchen) for a week for our family of four. The BB-H website said $10 extra per person per night (above two), but the VH site (I learned later) said $12 (and that's the rate they initially applied). When we arrived they tried to charge $15 (on grounds that now it was summer -- but of course they knew what date we were booking for when we booked)! Fortunately I had printed out the rate-page so they backed down (reluctantly). At first I got an email confirmation for a premium private room at the BB-WEST Hollywood -- but BB-WH doesn't have premium private rooms (with kitchen)! Eventually they got that sorted out, after being quite rude and unsympathetic (\"you must have booked on the wrong site\", but I had the print-out to prove that I hadn't). Our flight out of LA got canceled and we were put on a flight a day earlier so, out of courtesy, I called (before we arrived in LA) to say that we would only need 6 nights, not 7. They could only find a reservation for 4 days, which was rather worrying! Finally (after we arrived, and they checked it out more thoroughly) it turned out that we had 7 nights booked TWICE (but broken up, not all in the same room). Of course we had booked ONE room for the week, and they had said nothing about having to change rooms (twice!) when we booked. (I was quite unhappy about that and, perhaps for that reason, they ended up not moving us after all.) The \"free breakfast\" (toast and cereal) was supposed to be served 8:00-11:00, but the first day they ran out of bread by 10:15, another day they were out of oatmeal, etc. Instead of making food available, one had to ask the girl behind the counter (for bread, or cereal, or milk for coffee) -- and a sign made it clear that she would like tips (for handing us our free breakfast?).

I filled out the form, gave my credit card nu,ber as well as the security number on the backside of the card and the receptionist assured me the reservation was final. So I left and picked up my friend from LAX at the day of her arrival and we took the airport shuttle to the Hotel on Hollywood Blvd. as per recommendation of the foresaid receptionist. Immagine our surprise that upon our arrival in the hotel, my reservation semed to have vaporized, the receptionist moved back to Spain and my exhausted friend close to collapse. We sat for hours at the reception desk waiting for the manager to arrive. He finally did and was most unkind; basically I was told that I never made a reservation and they could do nothing to help us. The new receptionist called several hotels in the same area, but being it the high season................ finally the manager suggested we should take his offer for a night at the Fairfax at a lower price sure ($60/night), but no refund for the airport shuttle, no offer for a taxi to take us from Hollywood to Fairfax (I had to call my husband to get off work to drive us there), no compensation for the far more expensive Motel6 that had a room available and in the end telling me I should have made the reservation not in person but online so that there would be a record; he even suggested the form I filled out probably ended up in the garbagecan?????????????? I live around the corner of this hotel and basically I booked it for my friend because it really does look good and it's rates are proper for a Hollywood area. But I can assure you, the manager, Joe, has got no clue whatsoever on public relations or how to make his hotel worthwhile to recommend to a next possible traveler. No matter the location, no matter the friendly new receptionist, the unwilling and rude behaviour of the manager made this experience leave a nasty taste.", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Place For The Money, and Cool...\u201d", "Author": "Morphita", "ReviewID": "UR8236075", "Content": "The Vibe Hotel is actually a cool Motel from the '50's and has palm trees and is a very fun place.

My first stay was at a Hostel on Orange drive and Hollywood Blvd and moved on after 1 week. Clean but Below average. I found Vibe Hotel on a real estate website and found that for a Hostel it exceed my general expectations of a hostel although there were some moments.... I think I have valid grounds to review this place as I stayed here over 9 weeks. Now where to begin.... Housekeeping is EVERYDAY. Apparently there are lots of rumours of the cleaners stealing etc but this is NOT the case. They do not speak English and trying to tell them to come back and clean your room later or tomorrow is the only trouble you'll probably have with them. First room was the private room, where I stayed for four weeks at a rate of 250 dollars per week. Featuring an en suite shower room and bed with basic cable tv, refrigerator and microwave, mirror and a place to store your luggage. This place was clean and immaculate, spotless even the shower. Keys are given on your arrival and check in was smooth. This place has had a serious facelift and sometimes unfortunately you can hear the work going on. How this place works is that if you want to stay more than 28 days you have to move into the large apartment style room with full kitchenette and dining area. These rooms were the ones that needed improving the most as they were the oldest rooms. Kitchen utensils are provided as are fresh towels but I realised that not everything was pristine as I thought. Utensils have to be washed before use as no one else takes care of this. However beds are made everyday and there is a Barbeque Party on Saturday nights if your bored indoors. (Which I doubt you will be) I tried not to complain about anything while I was there until the day I was bitten by bedbugs. I told staff about the problem and they were great and supportive and moved me to another room. They tackled the problem immediately, and I have slept in four of their rooms and bedbugs really ARE rare. It seemed mine was a one off. I could be wrong as maybe other trippers may have found out otherwise... After being there a while I found some staff members started to act unprofessionally towards me and this made me feel uncomfortable. I didn't really complain much since I did not have the 200 pounds per night for hotels such as the Mondrian to stretch over 9 weeks and just got on with it. Service is basic. As I used to go down to make my regular payments I noticed things were not as professional as I thought as often you can hear staff arguing and fighting with one another in the middle of the night usually after they have had a drink or ten. Also, they really DO blaze the music loud so if you want somewhere peaceful, then this is NOT it. There is internet access which is free but given the number of people staying, to only four computers it's best you find an internet cafe, or better still, bring your laptop. Also in terms of getting around this is NOT the ideal place you want to be if you do NOT drive a car. The bus 217 takes ages to arrive and there is constant traffic in LA. The last thing you want to do is get stuck on a bus with weirdos in 4pm rush hour. And just to get to local shops you have to cross the road that leads to the 101 Freeway, quite dangerous if your a pedestrian! The nearest attractions are Hollywood Blvd but this is at least 20-30 minutes walk down the long long boulevard. The best places to stay, eat, shop, party are on the Sunset strip. Vibe is at least 10 minutes by car to the main parts Sunset Boulevard and at least 20 if ou want to be where the action is which is in the Beverly Hills area of the Sunset strip. Also there is Vine, starting from Hollywood and Vine, this crossroad is also where alot of action takes place. Plus the Arclight is nearby and this is the better cinema to hangout as this is where celebs go, better service, seats and general action, NOT the chinese theatre. An amazing record shop is right next door, only I have forgotten it's name! Better than Tower records but tower records is great to buy anything but music.... Regardless of what people say, if your a trendy budget jet setter like me, Hollywood Boulevard is NOT repeat NOT the place to be, the road is littered with mental and disabled people. Homeless and hungry people openly begging sometimes desperatly for food or money. Most of the time though they do not bother you. Further up, by all the so called attractions, are prostitutes and weirdos dressed up as famous characters from film and animation. Junk food and cheap shops selling vulgar items at ridiculous prices. Awful. Downtown LA is the same. The few things to visit there are the fashion, fabric and flower districts, and the Walt Disney Opera House or to catch the bus to disney land... If you have a car, and you are on a budget then this is definately the place to stay for a few days, especially if you are just crashing or trying to find your first ever apartment in LA. Weather: Was warm and bordering on blazing hot during the day, freezing at night during the winter. (Sept-Jan) Be sure to check out the Christmas parade on Hollywood blvd and at the Grove during late November. I visited Santa Monica, which is a more wealthier district and in my opinion one of the more picturesque places in California. Gorgeous beaches trendy beach people but mainly very wealthy, with strings of amazing restaurants, cars and the infamous third street promenade for shopping. I don't think there is any use talking about Rodeo drive as it is one small road, and in my Opinion, Sloane Street in London and Champs Elisees in Paris smack down Rodeo drive, they are just so much better. If you walk up to Santa Monica Pier, you can eat at some of the Oceanside restaurants there whilst catching the views of the sun setting into the Ocean. Amazing. Then there is Venice beach for all you hippy headonistic people out there. There is this thing called the drummers circle where all these free spirited and like minded musicians congregate to make music with what ever instruments they play, but it's mostly various different types of drums. Hence the drummers circle The other place to visit if you are a fashionista is the Grove and the Farmer's Market which is on Fairfax and Third in LA. Near by on Sundays is the flea market to get your one of a kind bits and pices like the celebs so often do. Also eat inside the grove at the many different world food stands where there is mexican and brazilian as well as sushi and southern food just to name a few. Then there is vintage. VINTAGE. Every vintage store you walk into is the size of a supermarket warehouse. They have one pretty much on every street corner, including a couple of famous ones on Melrose. Melrose is a long blvd and I cannot remember if it is North Melrose that has the slightly more up market boutiques and south have the more mainstream ones. Eitherway, GET YOUR ASSES down there because that is where the most amazing shopping of your life will take place. Go to Madison, Fred Segal, Agent Provocateur and Marc Jacobs on one end and Teenage Millionaire, Urban Outfitters and Ed Hardy on the other, these roads go on for miles and miles! PEOPLE: Very hard to meet people, they are indeed quite superficial and never really look up unless your name is Jennifer Aniston or Mischa Barton,but if you do, they are very warm and friendly and welcoming to the Euros, particularly us Brits. Everyone is very clique-y and you have to remember, if you go to various parts of LA, you will not always get the same reception. Also everyone drives because its a way of saying: 'I'm not poor'. Yes. Only poor people walk. Believe it when you see it. Also it's not as integrated as in the UK where black and white people live together and LA is predominately a latino community. In LA, there are NO GO areas you DO NOT WANT TO pass through find these out and beware. However if you know people there and you are familar with these places then go with someone who is street wise, mind you, all of LA LA land is quite dangerous as with any place in the World so make sure your always with company or in your car. Most LA people lock their car doors because apparently car jacking is still rife. In the right company, you may find your self hanging out with millionaires at the SKYbar at the Mondrian Hotel and checking out celebs at the new club called Hollies in Santa Monica! Also the food, at all the restaurants are amazing because Americans do NOT mess about when it comes to food. You can eat very well from Taco bell to Spago. Just remember only eat at places with grade As or Bs on their windows as this means they have passed and they are clean and safe to eat. You MUST stop by at the Griddle on Sunset, everybody knows it, just ask around for where the nearest cross road is, it's the best hangover breakfast food joint you've ever been to. On Saturdays and Sundays there are massive queues going down the street of people just waiting to eat there! Back to vibe Hotel they ARE really student friendly and full of information and regularly arrange trips to Universal Studios and Disneyland. They also sell calling cards and there is a middlebrow supermarket called Ralphs where you can buy your groceries. There is a tube system but in my opinion it is seriously underdeveloped but it's cheap clean and runs regularly if you cannot be bothered to walk or you want to visit the film studios in Burbank in North Hollywood. Now again, watch out because the tube/train system might not be up everyone's street as it picks up manual labourers and the homeless only as as I mentioned earlier, everyone drives. I could not believe the amount of homeless and poor people in LA and the so called American dream is some what an illusion for some this is quite sad, but mind you I was there working... So if you can accept that, then LA is an AMAZING place to be.... Oh and don't forget to tip 10-15 percent of the bill and not 50 percent like I did as restaurant bills were soooo cheap!

(Unfortunately, I didn't know about TripAdvisor at the time.) The website is so misleading. I booked a small room with private bath for 6 nights stay. The desk clerk was nice and showed us to our room. It was tiny and directly overlooked Hollywood Blvd. The window was broken and wouldn't close, so the traffic sound was deafening. The heater was broken, and the bed only had a thin blanket. Granted, this is southern California, so it's not like you need a down comforter, but it did get into the 40s at night! We had to wear clothes and socks to bed. There were, inexplicably, two unmade bunk beds crammed into our room along with our rock-hard queen-sized bed. These bunk beds completely blocked the closet, and there was no other place to store our clothes. Also, the toilet was the tiniest thing I have ever seen, and it got clogged immediately. (There was a plunger and I had to use it within the first 5 minutes of being there.) Also, there was a huge bucket of mop-water and Lysol outside our room, and it never moved the whole time we were there. The odor was disgusting. There is no phone in the room so if you want to contact the staff, you have to keep running down to the office. Also, the place is apparently only cleaned 3 times per week, I overheard the office clerk telling another guest. We had booked 6 nights there, but thank goodness the manager was nice and understood that it wasn't the place for us. We dealt with him politely and he was polite in return. So we only stayed the first night and received a refund for the remaining 5 nights. I think that much younger travelers (and we're only in our late 20s; it's not like we're elderly) who don't have much to spend on lodging might get a kick out of this place. The courtyard was nice and there's free internet access with plenty of Mac computers on site. The Vibe's vibe is very young. It's kind of like the dorms at college. I think that the location is really good, because it's on the outer edge of Hollywood and there is a cheap vegan restaurant directly across the street and a good Thai place 2 doors down.

The Vibe used to be a apartment building with little 300 sq ft studios. Somehow the Vibe thought a room designed for 2 at the most would be comfortable for 6. It was not. Further, they looked putting men in with the women when they had no reason to. For the most part many people live in CA and live at the Vibe because they do not have jobs that can support them in their own place. There are some travellers, but they stay very short because of the issues with the staff moving people, touching their things, stealing by staff, etc. Of the time I spent in the Vibe, 75% were living there on a permanent basis. They had mail delivered to them there. Further, the Vibe has been making more rooms into private rooms due the size, so by years end it could be back to its original purpose. The computer lab was constantly busy, old OS, and slow.
