I did not have time to explore the vicinities so, I cannot say much more than that it is a very good hotel with spacious rooms and comfortable modern bathrooms. The staff was very friendly and gave us tips and directions to where we wanted to go in such a short time. Oh, and very early in the morning ( like 6 a.m.) the room filled with smell of bacon.

We\u00b4ve just spent a long weekend in Madrid celebrating my 60th birthday and attending the unforgetable Bruce Springteen\u00b4s concert at Bernabeu stadium (almost 4 hours of non stop dedicated performance by the Boss!!!). Ac Recoletos by Marriott: a 4 star hotel (there is a more expensive 5 star version at the other end of Acala Gate called AC Palacio del Retiro) Both Ac hotels are situated in the best area of Madrid: the \"posh\" quarter of barrio de Salamanca (a Spanish version the Parisian XVth Quarter). At AC Recoletos for less than \u20ac 180 you may live (at leat for a few days) just a few steps from Serrano Street and Castellana Avenue. It is the best and safest area in Madrid close to the Metro and the museums. Serrano is \"fashion street\" and the area has many good shops and restaurants ( we booked well in advance a table at the trendy Ten-kon-Ten - Paraguas Restaurant!!!). No need to worry about breakfast because in Serrano St. you have cafeteria Mallorca which is a more exclusive type of Starbucks. Around the corner there is a sophisticated place comprising restaurant, disco bar and terrace at Plaza de la Independencia and Alcala Gate called Ramses. The hotel has parking facility for some 22 \u20ac per day and the staff is young, helful and attentive. The hotel is modern, neat and clean. Most rooms have wonderful balconies looking onto the two corner streets. To be a \"neighbour\" of the calle Serrano does not require to become a \"loaded\" burgeois if only for a few days!!! I strongly recommend this hotel although if stopping over at the airport for one or two nights my choice has always been the Silken Puerta de America hotel where architecture and design are astonishing milestones.

We stayed a couple of places on our trip and agreed that this was the best property due to the location. We used Marriott points for our stay (3 nights) and encountered no problems with the visit. The hotel is well situated to all transporation - and closest to the Airport bus that will take you directly for 2.50 EUROS. When going to the airport, make sure you find the right stop as it is not on the main stop, but on a small side street. It is a big Yellow bus that says Aeropuerto so you can't miss it and it runs during the week every 20 minutes. One note is the hotel is on a one-way small side street so no taxis usually go by...but you can find them on the main streeet around the corner. The decor of the hotel is modern and clean. We were able to share the room with 3 adults - they did charge for the extra person in the room, but provided a rollaway bed to make sure it was comfortable. The only downfall to the room was the bathroom was closed off from the room by frosted glass - which did not always provide the most privacy when in use (it was good that we knew each other well). I am sure you could get away without the fee, but like all European hotels - they don't like a lot of people in the room. Like all the AC hotels in Madrid, the mini-bar was free and wi-fi was available free in the lobby. There was no wi-fi access in the room (even for a fee). The front desk was very helpful with information on local shopping and dining. They spoke decent english, but appreciate if you try a little Spanish. They made restaurant reservations for us. Since it is close to high end shopping - most of the restaurants they suggest are rather pricey, but if you explore, there are plenty of places for all budgets. There are great little restaurants/pastry shops around the corner of the hotel for a nice breakfast and much cheaper than the 20 Euro for the hotel buffet. For great pastries and coffee - check out the place around the corner that has Brunch in capital letters out front. We found this an excellent place for a quick snack.

This hotel has a good central location near Retiro Park and a few high end boutiques in the exclusive Salamanca district of Madrid and has a funky, modern Spanish interior. Rooms are relatively spacious and well designed. The breakfast is great and in the evenings there are several great restaurants within a short walking distance of the hotel. However the hotel has several significant and unnessasary shortcomings which is surprising for a Marriott property. While there is free wifi in the hotel lobby, access to wifi in the rooms is only possible through the online purchase of a roaming card from a local Spanish telecoms provider. Their website is complicated, available in Spanish only and useless if you don't have a Spanish mobile telephone. Upshot was me losing around 15 USD trying to figure it out unsuccessfully. Could the concierge have helped? Maybe, but it has been years since I have come across such preoccupied, unhelpful and aggressive staff at reception in an international hotel (with the exception of the lady who manned the front desk in the evenings and went out of her way to be helpful). Her colleague Mirabel's calling is not in the hospitality industry. From the moment she cheerfully announced in Spanish to me after an overnight transatlantic trip that it would be hours before my room was ready (she insisted over the entire course of my stay to address me in Spanish even though I - who speak 3 languages fluently - struggle in the language and she speaks English well enough) I sensed that this grumpy lady was not in the slightest bit interested in making me feel welcome. Every request appeared to be a huge imposition and every offer of assistance half hearted: a request for directions to a gymnasium that would accept guests on a Sunday met with shruggs and eventually advice that there were a couple of gyms in the vicinity but that she neither knew if they were open nor whether they accepted non members (the gym in the hotel is frankly useless: a subterranean broom closet with a creaking treadmill and the meagre leftovers of what was once a complete set of dumbbells). She made a limp attempt at a couple of phone calls at my insistence but to no avail. Ultimately I found several options myself on the internet. I picked this hotel from many great options in Madrid because the promotional material said that it had wifi in the rooms and an onsite gymnasium (rare in Madrid). I have commented on how both are somewhat misleading statements and found no reason to return to this establishment.

The lobby is very small and the bar was deserted at all times, which doesn't encourage you to have a drink and makes you want to get to your room as quickly as possible. The breakfast was very good. The standard rooms are a bit small compared to other AC hotels, although the price is higher. Seleccion hotels used to have a free bar at certain hours: no such feature visible at Recoletos. On the whole, I was quite disappointed by the general quality of the hotel and would have chosen another one, even for a higher price.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eidnhoven", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "smcwtrip", "ReviewID": "UR69165198", "Content": "The last 3 times we have been in Madrid we were in this hotel.

Staff was good, service decent, (no one went out of their way but acceptable service, no complaints) room was clean and modern but the bathroom needs real walls not those opaque glass dividers that really provides no privacy. I traveled w/ my husband so not a big deal but if anyone else, it would have been real uncomfortable. That's my biggest issue. The beds are more like cots but I think that's the standard over there. Oh, the minifridge in the room has water bottles and juices and beer that are free of charge, that's a real plus. Overall, I had an enjoyable experience.

It's a lovely hotel in a great location and would be lovely to go for a romantic weekend break, but we had our 6 month baby with us and so the room wasn't the best family room, in addition the cot we were given had a broken leg and the hotel would not provide us with a kettle to boil the baby water, they insisted that we ring up every time we needed hot water which is quite often so we ended up buying a cheap kettle ourselves! The breakfast is extremely expensive at nearly 20 Euros each, so if it is not included in your room rate I would recommend walking out and finding somewhere nice nearby.
