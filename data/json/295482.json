The rooms are extremely nice and most have a view. Due to the small amount of rooms we always felt like beeing the only guests. Peolple are friendly and helpful. Tip: If you stay more than one night ask for a special breakfast. Otherwise they bring you the same plate of varieties every day. They are good but could be a bit boring. Downside: they definitely have a problem with their Aircon: Everytime I stayed there it was extremely warm in the room. Tip: when you check in, ask if they have an upgrade. The difference between the tiny rooftop room and a normal room is hughe and can completely change your holiday experience. Also regarding view: we have had a balcony to the Bosphorus (great) and at another time basically the wall of another building in front of the windows :-(", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Khartoum, Sudan", "Title": "\u201cWatching the ships go by and eating fresh fish\u201d", "Author": "Laura B", "ReviewID": "UR128166124", "Content": "This hotel has a delightful location. On the Asian side it feels much more like a \"real\" place than Sultanahmet, although obviously sightseeing (apart from boat trips) is harder. The restaurants are better, in particular the service, and far better value. This hotel is just by a little seafront square which has a great range of fish and other restaurants. The hotel breakfasts are good too. The highlight is of course the ships going right past your window - you can watch them for hours (and at marinetraffic dot com you can find out where they came from and where they are going too).

It was easy to understand that this was previously a \"palace\" for a very rich individual. We had a room overlooking the Bosphorus. It was adequately furnished in a sort of 1930s way. It was very light and bright as was the bathroom. We arrived quite late but the restaurant was still open and a fine light meal was a pleasure after hours of delay at the airport and through the nightmare that is Istanbul`s traffic. Having only eight or nine rooms the breakfast buffet was adequate as opposed to being lavish but individual requests were pleasantly complied with. The desk staff were very helpful.
