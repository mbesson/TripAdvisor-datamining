I was on a layover in AMS and decided to go to the city center. Since my flight to Brussels is in early morning, I decided to just spend the night at the hostel. Hotel Jimmy was along the street so I decided to look. The staff just asked me to register, asked for EUR50 for the night, refused to give a discount for scrapping the breakfast option and asked me to wait for a bit to get a room. I was shocked when he went inside a prison cell-like or closet-like hole and just pulled out the old bedsheet and just replaced it with another one. The space is like a closet with just a prison bed and sink! I could not help myself but complain that there's no space. He just said, \"But you're just going to sleep!\" I DEMANDED a full refund. Good thing he returned my money because I just can't stand the filth. This is a terrible option for any traveller. Only settle for this if there is absolutely no other choice.Exhausted and exasperated, I just spent the night in one of the recliner chairs in Schipol Airport.

As every flight was cancelled , European air space closed down . KLM refusing to provide any support or assistance , I spent the night at the airport which is not good , the next day I went into Amsterdam to find an hotel. No luck , no vacancies anywhere. Except for Hotel Jimmy, It was like something out of the League Of Gentleman. I have never been to prison but no prisoners would be housed in accommdation as that offered at Hotel Jimmy. Every resident was trying to escape Amsterdam or was it Hotel Jimmy ?, I felt pretty fed up , down , frustrated but lying in my cell at night listening to the drunken screams & shouts of fellow Jimmy residents, I thought , what have I done to deserve this . Even the bed isn't really a bed but a wooden box , I am not kidding . The staircase is really something, I have never seen any thing like it, is it designed to punish residents for crimes from another life ? The shower & toilet are in the same corridor as the cells. On a more postive note there was plenty of hot water. The internet is not free as advertised . When I think I was charged 80 euros to stay at this \" Hotel \" . I did return to the UK via Calais , but that is another story.

My friend on the other hand his room was somewhat to be said for! Him and this wife open there door to find that there bed was not made and looked like someone had just got out of bed! We walked around for ages intil i decided to get drunk so i could go back to the hotel and get into the bed from hell! No matter how much i drunk i was unable to get drunk not good as know i was heading to the bates motel! On returning back to the the room the nosie from outside was driving me mad, if the nosie of the bike bells or dust cart or the trains dont keep you away the nosie of something else would or the smell or some enlaw drugs or cig smoke! i laid there with the soap box on my nose to combat the smell. that night i would say i cryed to sleep but i laughed myself to sleep! The next morning well i decided to jump to the shower i need another just from that shower i though things were bad in barsa this was far worst! (i think the british army should use it for training for war zones when everyone would be redy for war) I turned on the shower only to find out no hot water aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh That was the final straw i decide with my father and friend we have breakfast and leave not to return, well in the breakfast room about 8 guys from the middle east were shavening that was it time to leave the hotel.

After 2 weeks of a brief backpacking trip around London, Brussels, Luxembourg and Paris, staying in reasonable backpacker and hotel accomodation, my boyfriend and I decided to round off our trip in Amsterdam, with the hope of a relaxing and enjoyable week before heading back to Australia. Having made the mistake of not booking accomodation in advance (in July - the summer season), we trekked around the 'Dam for a couple of hours trying to find any available and affordable accomodation. Finally, in despiration, we tried a 'hotel booking service' who, to our relief, agreed to arrange accomodation for us. If only we had known what we were in for!! We ended up at the Hotel Jimmy (shudder!) where, for the sum of 80 euros a night (which we had to pay upfront) we had an army barracks style room on the fourth floor (no lift!), which contained one bed slightly only larger than a single, a small sink, and a TV that could not be turned on without the remote (which was not provided). We also had shared bathroom/shower facilities, which were unpleasant to say the least. On top of this, it turned out that the cleaner only came every second day, and guests had to request in advance for their room to be cleaned, bins emptied, and sheets/towels to be changed. As a result, in our 6 night stay we managed to get a change of sheets once. These features of the hotel, combined with the lack of air conditioning (in the sweltering summer heatwave of '06), non-stop noise from the street, inability to block out much light from outside, and the surly service from the owners, made our stay unforgettable for all the wrong reasons! The only good thing was the proximity of the place to the train station, so as to provide for a quick escape!! What a SCAM!! Do not be sucked in like we were. Book ahead is all I can recommend.

Neither was true. OVERPRICED: The front desk clerk informed us that all the other hotels were booked and had no rooms available for the whole weekend (which I discovered the next day to be a lie). I noticed that he used the same fear strategy the next evening on other tired and weary tourists in order to instill panic in them so that they would be willing to pay any price to have shelter. We were charged 120 Euros for 3 people to stay in one cramped room. Nearby hostels charged only 20-30 Euros per person and their facilities were way better. Also we were told that there was a 3-night minimum stay although we only needed lodging for 2 days and was charged the extra day regardless. DIRTY: The back of the toilet seat was not clean and had urine build up from God knows how long. The sheets and blankets were also soiled. The room was evidently dusty and grimy. Although we had a TV, it was broken. NOISY: The hotel is located on a very busy street, therefore we were awoken at the crack of dawn with the public trolleys constantly riding by, honking their horns. This continues on incessantly until about midnight. INCONVENIENT: The hotel clerk has to open and close the automatic door at his discretion for security purposes, therefore you are not able to go in the building at your convenience. There is a camera that he observes and since you have to climb up the stairs to even get to the front desk, you are not able to see if there is anyone even there to let you in. At one point, we had to wait outside for over 15 minutes to enter the hotel. This was not reassuring. What could the staff be doing that they were too busy to let a guest in?
