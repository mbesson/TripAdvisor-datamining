After this we checked out the second \"disabled room\" they told us to get into the lift go to the 3rd floor and then go up the stairs to the fourth floor as the lift only goes to the third. I explained that would be an issue as we had already told them we booked a room with an 84 year old grandparent who was in a wheel chair. After much complaining on their part they placed us in the room on the ground floor by reception, was not great but did the job. We moved our room that night also to a little larger (not better) room, this was by the lift and all you could hear was the lift motor and banging of the door. The lift is not suitable for a wheel chair either, it was like a comedy pushing her into the lift and pressing the button quickly before the door shut then running down to meet her on the ground floor just as some one else pressed for the lift and she was going back up... the lift was SO small. Breakfast was far from interesting, terrible service they spilled milk all over the floor while clearing up (looks like it happens a lot) and we were served bread rolls and cornflakes.

We were visiting London for one night (on a Saturday) to go to the Proud Cabaret and needed somewhere as a base and to sleep the night. We found the Lord Jim in an ideal spot as it is so close to the Earls Court tube station. On first impressions from street view, the hotel looked clean, tidy and very pretty. Check in was not until 2 pm, but we arrived half an hour early with the view that maybe we could sit in the lounge while we wait for them to get the room ready. We did not want to have to carry our bags around London as they were very heavy and the hot weather made it feel like a chore. To our (very pleasant) surprise, we were told that there would be a room available for us immediately. The gentleman that greeted us on reception was very pleasant and enjoyed a joke with us while we checked in. We had booked through lastminute.com (my partner had also contacted the hotel the day before check in to confirm the booking, we would recommend this as there have been issues with bookings taken through that particular site) and requested a double/twin room. On confirming the booking, my partner had requested a double if one is available and was told that the hotel would do their best to accomodate us. We also met with one of the housekeeping staff on the way to our room, she was also friendly and polite, so overall so far, excellent customer service. When we arrived in our room, we found that we had been allocated one of the larger rooms, with two double beds! No complaints there! The room was very clean, the beds were very comfortable and tea and coffee were in abundance. The windows also opened properly, which is a refreshing change. The en-suite bathroom was also very clean and we had been given plenty of towels. The shower is not huge but big enough to have a good shower and the water is lovely and hot. It does take a while to heat up but perseverance is key. On returning from our night out we were let in the hotel and greeted by another friendly chap sitting on reception. The next morning we went down to breakfast, which is in a small room in the basement. Breakfast consisted of tea, coffee and juice, pastries, cereal, yoghurts and fruit and a rack of toast which is handed to you on arrival at breakfast (guests can also request more toast). This was fresh and tasty and did the job that breakfast should do, sets you up for the day. The funny thing about breakfast was that it was the first time during our stay that we had seen or heard any other guests. It is such a lovely and quiet place. At checkout we thanked the staff for a lovely stay and were thanked for our feedback. The gentleman that had checked us in also mentioned how lovely we looked dressed up for the previous night, we thought this was a lovely and personal touch. We would definitely stay in this hotel again and plan to visit London later in the year so fingers crossed for vacancies. This is not a five star hotel but easily offers five star customer service.

I had booked a twin room, as I didn't think my grown up daughter would want to 'share with mummy', but she had no choice as it was a double bed not twin, and the hotel had no other rooms available.

We went out for a meal, as there are a good selection of reastaurants, bars and cafes all within 2 minutes walking distance of the hotel.

The same receptionist from earlier said he would sort it and advised me to call from our room if I needed him again. By 3am, still noisy and still no sleep, I tried to call reception and the phone didn't work! Back to reception in my PJ's, again I reported the noise from below our room, again I was told it would be sorted. No apology was received at either time. The noise still continued. Finally got to sleep somewhere about 4am, so if you are a nightowl, or out most of the night, this shouldn't be a problem. However, if you need to sleep in, this isn't possible either due to traffic noise, doors slamming around the hotel etc. Breakfast was basic, but fresh......O.J, toast, croissants, cereal, fruit bowl, coffee was excellent - something needed to be be!

The street where the hotel is located,can be sometimes noisy at nights (other many hotels and people around) and since in warm weathers the window is open, this may be a bit distrubing at nights.Similary if the people in the hotel are the noisy and \"door-banging\" types,you may hear those as well. The breakfast hours were quite early (7:30-9:00) and the breakfast room was very small.In order to find a place, you had to go quite early-which was not very preferable for me after walking all day in the city. One other thing ,before going there I had sent an e-mail to the hotel to confirm my booking and had no reply from them at all -which I found unprofessional. Anyway, I think that from this level hotels (2-3 stars/ b&b) in London ,you shouldn't expect much. Yes,they are pricy (compared to the service) but still can't be compared with global standards. Therefore if it is clean and central that should be ok -at least that was all my expectation and I can say that Lord Jim was quite ok in that sense. However if you are looking for some more quality and comfort I'd suggest to go for at least 4-star hotels.

Located at Earls Court Tube Station(3mins walk) is along the Piccadilly Line(=direct line to Heathrow) and among the few stations that has handicap access(=with elevators=luggage friendly). View from room window is of quiet tree-lined neighbourhood(not bad!). Hotel has a tiny lift to most floors(=luggage friendly). Room and toilet is very small. The room itself seemed ok at first look with new wallpaper & new bathroom fittings. But the cleaniness was horrible. The toilet walls and door are smeared with toothpaste???, fingersmudges and other ??? stuffs. The shower cubicle's floor and the wash basin were slimy. Shower very weak. The bed-linen was moldy when bedcover and blanket was pulled away coz rather warm and w/o air-conditioning in room. The phone and remote control were sticky with orange juice or sth.

I booked on travelstay(-) for a single room in July. When I turned up at the Lord Jim reception I was told that I was actually booked in to another hotel owned by the same people. So I walked to the Court Hotel on Earls Court Road and found it to be a door with a shabby awning over it between two shops. When I checked in my room was tiny, but clean and comfortable apart from the noisy road and a window that didn't close properly. Needless to say I didn't get much sleep because of sirens and other traffic noise. There was a sink in the room with a hot water unit on the wall but with no tap coming from it so actually no use. One of the communal showers was also broken. In the morning was the worst part though, I went down for breakfast expecting the continental breakfast promised at the Lord Jim. Instead I was faced with a \"do-it-yourself\" kitchen where there was white bread for toast and margarine and jam on the table. To make things worse there was hair in the margarine. The \"chioce\" of drinks was instant coffee or tea bags. As I don't eat white bread I was unable to eat breakfast at the hotel. Guests were also expected to wash their own dishes after they had used them! Even if brown bread had been on offer I doubt I would have eaten in that kitchen at all. So if you so book to stay at the Lord Jim Hotel but are told when you arrive that you are actually staying in the Court Hotel don't go there. Fight for the room you have booked in the Lord Jim on the quiet side road with a full continental breakfast. I found out later that the Court Hotel is infact registered as a hostel, not a 2* hotel. This is called misrepresentation and is illegal.

We live in Europe and are frequent global travelers and London is a favorite destination of ours. We've stayed in places that were a disgarce compared to the Lord Jim, paying more for a room and dealt with rude, incompetent staff, unclean rooms, etc at some of those other places- the Central Park Hotel in Bayswater comes to mind- (It was awful)...but not so at the Lord Jim! The experience with this hotel and its convenient location was pleasant and a GREAT deal for the money. True, the breakfast room is small, but we surmounted that in part by arriving as early as possible, for one thing. More of a problem was that when we arrived each day, some of the guests were reluctant or refused to share open seating at the communal tables with folks they didn't know. For instance, virtually every time we went to breakfast, there would be 1 or 2 people taking up a table with 4 seats, and much grumbling if we asked if we could use their available, unused seats. Come on, it won't kill anyone to share a table with strangers for a half hour or so. People sit next to strangers at lunch and cafe/bar counters all of the time, don't they? And though the breakfast spread would not rival that of the Ritz Carlton, it was certainly of an adequate quality. Coffee, tea, juice, rolls, croissants, creals, hard boiled eggs, toast, jam, butter and fruit, exactly what I'd expect at a hotel in this class. The breakfast room staff stayed right on top of things and were quite accommodating. Our double-bedded room was very small, but we expected that as well for this hotel category- it was clean, well-provisioned, and comfortable. That's all we require, especially since we're not even in our hotel room most of the time while touring. But it makes it that much nicer when the room you return to after a day of sightseeing and exploring is cozy and clean. Our room there was always clean and well-kept.. The LJ is located on a lovely, quiet street. The staff in the reception area were always friendly, patient and helpful during the course of our stay. There is Internet service in the vicinity of the reception area, as well as snack vending machines. Continental breakfast was included with room price. A big plus is the close proximity to the Earl's Court tube station- just a short stroll away, and also there are quite a few shops, pubs and eateries nearby. We wouldn't hesitate to book at the Lord Jim again, it passed all of our expectations for the price range and we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tamworth, Staffs", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant stay!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4018832", "Content": "I had previously read some bad reviews on this website and was worried what my stay would be like.
