When we arrived at the reception, a smooth-talking man casually informed us that our room was no longer available because rain had caused some pipes to leak. He assured us everything would be fine because he'd secured us a room at their 'sister' hotel down the road that was also 4*. However, it quickly became clear that it was 4* in name only. We were put in the smallest room we've ever seen. Even worse, it was on the ground floor barely 3 metres from the reception desk. We'd thought the guy was joking when he said he'd show us to our room and then walked four paces to his left, but no! We asked if we could move room but lo and behold, the hotel was apparently fully-booked for the full three nights we were due to stay. So we had no choice but to endure three restless nights due to the noise as people passed in and out of reception late into the night and first thing in the morning. Not even close to a 4* experience. Worst of all was the manner in which the receptionist treated us - he was blunt, dismissive, and couldn't care one hoot that we were unhappy at being moved to another hotel and then being put in such a pathetically small room. We got the distinct impression that because we'd got a good price on hotels.com, we shouldn't expect anything more from them. There is another review on this site and it tells an almost identical story about 'leaking pipes' and being moved to a low-grade sister hotel. The reviewer suggested this was a scam intended to help fill undesirable rooms at this worse hotel down the road. On this experience, I'd have to agree. We still enjoyed our stay in Venice but it was no thanks to the hotel. And even now, the experience leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.

However the Boulevard Hotel is definitely not what we would call 4 star. Our room was tiny, there was only just enough space to squeeze past the double bed. The bathroom was very nice, with a bidet and a proper bath, which was most welcome after a day of walking in freezing cold weather. It was also nice and warm in the room. The room and bathroom were kept very clean and the towels and sheets were changed daily, which was very good. Toiletries are replaced every day. The breakfast was quite adequate and the overworked waiters tried their best to keep up with the constant stream of guests, but tables were left uncleared; the hot dishes were not replenished that swiftly and the fruit bowl was not topped up but disappeared when empty. There was no brown or wholemeal bread, or salad bits.

So cheap we didnt expect much from the hotel. Arrived to be told they had no booking for us (nor for the other 2 parties who arrived at the same time). Got sorted quite quickly. I had read reviews on the hotel and asked for a quiet room that wasnt too small. Got a noisey room that was like a match box but the bathroom was nice. The manager told us he gets 6 paparazzi in it during the film festival week though we could not work out how! It didnt matter because the location to the water boats was good and that's all we needed to get over to the main Island (20 mins trip).The room had a mini fridge and tv so it was ok. No kettle though so you may wish to take your own. Beds and pillows quite hard but that seems to be the way in Italy? Supermarket next door for milk, water, wine etc Venice is beautiful and we loved every minute. Food in restaurants is dreadful and expensive so dont go expecting fine dining. Our first night out we fancied real Italian pasta...it came microwaved from frozen and cost a small fortune! This is not unusual. Staff are rather matter of a fact but they do the job. I believe the hotel gets very busy in Summer and at film festival time so I dont think we would visit then. Breakfast was fine....plenty and nice and not many other guests. Lido island itself has nothing special in the winter so all time will be spent on the other islands - there are no canals nor Venetian beauty to it. It is a seaside resort in the summer for Italians so will get busy. Eating places are open but not very good. Likewise the shops. Plenty to do in Venice - highlights are island hopping (water boats are so easy to use and very frequent) and wandering around Venice itself. Murano, Burano and Torcello can all easily be done in one day and are lovely. Avoid buying \"cheap\" Murano glass ware...no such thing, they are Chinese imports! (Buy a travel card for 72 hours usually lasts for 4 day stay) for 33E as soon as you start using them. On sale everywhere. This will get you anywhere you want. If you are into books and history....try a visit to the Armenian monestry which is on its own beautiful island - catch the Boat number 20 mid afternoon and a guide will meet you and take you around for about 6E. Tour lasts about 90 mins then they see you back again. Some fascinating history, objects and manuscripts. Very easy to do and you dont have to book in advance. There were only 6 on our trip so it was lovely and personal. Guide speaks all languages. Rialto market early every morning is great for fresh fruit and produce and the eating places are a bit cheaper round there. Toilets are expensive everywhere (even on remote islands) - nearly \u00c2\u00a31.50 a go unless you are in a cafe. No free ones that we could find! Easy to get to Lido from Trevisso....bus outside airport then water bus. Everyone else seemed to be doing the same thing so follow the crowd. This bus is extra to the 33E and is about 9E each way....save a bit by buying a return. Check times back...this bus is not as frequent as water buses. The bus service is run to meet the Ryan air flights to/from Trevisso so all the staff know what is going on. The Doge's palace is worth the entry fee. St Marks is free to see the main bit but will cost to see the interesting parts as you go along. The best plan is to just get lost and enjoy wandering around the many beautiful streets and canals.

This hotel is lovely looking from the outside, the inside lobby area, dining area etc. This hotel is ideal to stay in because it has a great location AWAY from those horrific Venice crowds and it is a pleasant boat ride back to the main attractions at Venice. HOTEL ROOMS : These are small and somewhat stuffy. We arrived in November 2011, with fairly coolish temperatures outside. The heating was way too high in the hotel, and we had to resort to opening the windows at night to have some air circulation as the air conditioning unit made a terrible noise. In fact, I don't know if the \"cooling\" part of the air conditioning worked. When one opens the windows, the noise from the outside comes straight into the room - this isn't too bad during the day, but at night it does disturb sleep. Otherwise it was clean and quiet. BATHROOM : Clean and neat and a full sized bath in our room which was pleasant - though we did not use it. The bathroom window is a trap! Our room had a bathroom window which actually fell right out of its frame when I tried to open it. I let the hotel know about this. Beware travellers! BREAKFAST : Typical European breakfast of cereal, cheese, cold meat/salami and pastries. The breakfast room is quite ornate and mirrored. The heating is again, way too high to enjoy it for too long. OK, here's where I have to air my grievance a bit. The receptionists were all very helpful if a little reserved, but this is extremely professional. However, when we asked the gentleman at the reception which boat we could take to Murano to the glass factory he told us the following: a) He would arrange to have one of his colleagues take us down to the boat jetty to have a special boat take us there for free. b) And then we would have a boat trip back to Venice. What ACTUALLY happens is this:- Yes, the boat is a free ride to the factory. But nothing is free in this world... The alleged \"glass factory\" is not what you think it is. According to a local of 45 years, this Murano glass factory is just a selling tool to get you to buy from them. You arrive and you are ushered into a demonstration room where three glass blowers are making some ornamental trinkets. Then afterwards, you are guided through the various show rooms and encouraged to buy. The salesman does not stop showing you things and offering you \"special prices\" for your visit. A note here : an aquarium type piece featuring fish, bubbles etc was priced there at E4,500 (Yes, four thousand five hundred Euros). He offered a few hundred off at a special price. The SAME one is found on Lido at E1,500. Now once you buy you are hurried out of the showrooms to make room for the next customer - it's not a subtle gesture either. It's \"ok, go now. I get boat\" type of thing. We waited for a boat to take us back to Venice as promised (in the rain and wind, alone on the jetty). Finally, I went back inside and hung around trying to get someone's attention. Finally, it was the boat driver who patently ignored us 25 minutes previously when arriving on the jetty saying \"no no I don't know who\" (he didn't want to take us back - he went inside and had coffee and a gossip with his mates instead). This is hard, hard sell and unless you are a determined shopper who never falls for this type of scam, do NOT go there. I found earrings for myself at a \"special\" price and was hugely disappointed to find the same ones at 1/3 of the price at Venice. Oh well, live and learn I guess. As we spent several days in Lido we got to know a few of the shop keepers around and they were very happy to tell us that the Hotels take a \"cut\" of the sold goods on the Murano island \"factory\". They say it is a shop only, as the real glass factories are absolutely out of bounds to tourists and the public (which makes perfect sense, when one considers workplace health and safety laws). I am not sure on this, but I heard it several times, so I can only pass on what I know and say BEWARE. On a more positive note, the Hotel is right in the hub of Lido. It's a ten minute walk to a laundromat (where the soap and softener is automatically added to the washers)!! A walk further will take you to the beach. Next door to Hotel is a Billa market for food etc and there are loads of little bars or restaurants around. Another tip. Try not to buy Venice jewellery. It is overpriced and is aimed squarely at tourists who have no sense when on holidays. Everything is overpriced. Everything!! So go and enjoy your sights but keep the jewellery buying to somewhere off the beaten tourist track. If you do want to buy some gold or silver from Italy, then I recommend the only jeweller in Lido who has somewhat different pieces and has reasonable prices. Would I stay on Lido again instead of Venice? Definitely yes. Not in high summer though. The crowds would be a huge put off. Would I stay in Le Boulevard Hotel again? Hmmmm, I don't know about that. Maybe not. I'd have to see what else was around before choosing this place again. It's the noise and the air-conditioning and the sleight of hand with the Murano Glass \"Factory\" which put me off.

The single lift was slow and usually occupied, so we carried our shoulder bags up to the fourth floor to find our room, 432. There was a room 433, but no 432. Still puffing after the walk-up, I left my wife and shoulder bag on the 4th floor and walked down to reception to ask the whereabouts of the missing room 432. The man at reception rang a bell and a bellboy appeared, asked for my key, and ceremoniously walked me about 10 paces away from the reception desk to room 432 on the ground floor. He opened the door of my room with a great show of helpfulness. When I asked for the key back so I could go fetch my wife on the 4th floor, he exclaimed, \"Oh my God!\" as if no other guest had a similar experience. (Second story) I brought our ice pack to reception to ask that it be put in the freezer, and again the bell was rung and the same ubiquitous bellboy appeared and took the ice pack to be put in the freezer. The next morning we found that it was put in the refrigerator and not in the freezer. The bellboy was no longer ubiquitous.

If you go ahead and book this hotel and get given room 429 then my advice is to ask for another room. Good luck. The guy on reception didn't seem to care when I asked for another room. It is a tiny attic room with no window (unless you count the window in the bathroom but you have to stand in the bath to see out) but two skylights - 1 of which didn't open. If you sleep on the left side of the double bed and are taller than a dwarf you will have to walk bent over to save hitting your head. We had to put a table into the wardrobe in order to get enough room on the floor for two suitcases.

When we finally did get to the hotel the following day the staff at Le Boulevard informed me that they had already given our room away and we would still be charged for both nights. The staff gave the impression of not really caring at all but did make one call and it so happened that a hotel just down the street did have a triple room that we could take while Le Boulevard and Hotels.com sorted out the booking mess between the two. After several discussions between both hotels.com and the staff at Le Boulevard it was decided that I would still have to pay for both nights, however since they had rented out our room Le Boulevard would pay for our night at the other hotel. At the time this seemed satisfactory to me after all the stress of just getting to Venice and being able to sleep. Upon trying to check out the following morning our hotel (Atlanta) calls Le Boulevard regarding the previous agreement and is told by a different individual at Le Boulevard who claimed to be the manager, that he would under no circumstances pay for our room regardless of what his colleague had agreed to. I spoke with this individual as well and out of all the rude Venetians I dealt with this guy takes the cake! So after another extensive call to Hotels.com I am told to pay for the room, submit the receipt to hotels.com, and they reimburse me (which they did). But hotels.com did mention that this is not the first problem they have had with the staff at Le Boulevard.

If it was advertised as a 2 star you might be pretty happy with what you got.

We paid \u00c2\u00a380 for the larger room on expedia, don't pay more than that! There was a group of very rowdy excited school children aged 13-14 in every room on our floor (1st floor) except ours, so we asked to move after the first night and they were really funny about it - but I insisted and insisted and was eventually given quite a lovely room on the top floor (even thought they were adamant they had absolutely no other rooms available) which was silent for the next 3 nights. The two rooms we stayed in had been refurbished - but done up in a n old fashioned style - lots of mahogany and deep reds and greens - not my cup of tea at all. Breakfast is appalling - awful food, 30 unclean tables every morning. A huge group of backpackers arrived whilst we were there - this is just above hostel standard acomodation and popular with backpackers as not much more than a hostel price and they get a private room. The smaller budget priced rooms are the smallest I have ever seen and are not worth the \u00c2\u00a370 per night (unless you are backpacking). The rooms are clean though, and it is in an excelent location. The waterbuses are very regular and the 62 and 51/52 takes 35 minutes to P. de Roma, or the 82 and 51 take 15 minutes to Saint Mark's Square. The number 1 takes a bit longer as it stops at every stop - though worth it if you get the front seats outside to go all the way up the grand canal. Venice is very expensive - there is even a charge to get in some churches! Every toilet is 1 euro and drinks in main square 16 euros for a Bellini/cocktail!

The only Italians that work in the hotel are on the front desk and most were helpful, except the young one that worked the night/ early morning shift that was very grumpy and surly. The chambermaids and porters are all Filipinos, they are all helpful, but the hotel is seriously understaffed.

The hotel is very clean as was my room. The hotel is decorated blandly, (except for my bathroom which was blood red) with nothing to suggest that you were in Venice, I could be anywhere in the world. I had booked a single room, and I think that the room would have be ok with a single bed, but I was surprised to see that there was a double bed which completely dominated the room. The bathroom only had a shower and it was a very small cubicle. If you drop the soap in the shower you could not bend down the pick it up, you had the get out of the shower to do it. One plus was the aircon worked very well as the temperatures were in the low 30\u00c2\u00bas. The breakfast was the continental, cold meats, cheeses, pastries, cereals plus scrabble eggs and bacon. Fruit juices and coffee are from a machine, the coffee was very strong and the juice seemed watered down. They had a coach load of American tourists for two days of the four that I stayed there, and they did not seem able to cope with such a large amount of people at breakfast, food run out, table left dirty. On he other day that I stayed there things were ok. Venice is great, and this is my third trip (the first on my own) and the Lido is the perfect place to use as your base. Overall seeing that I was staying on my own, the location was good and the hotel was cheap for Venice, I would stay there again under similar circumstances.

Lovely furnishings throughout, and the hotel even arranged a FREE private water taxi when we wanted to go to the island of Murano.
