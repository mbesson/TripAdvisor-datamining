The hostel is only small (1 x 10 bed dorm and 3 doubles) which I lked. On a negative side there is only 1 shower room and 1 toilet, which we didn't find a problem, but I can imagine if the hostel is full could be a pain in a morning. The price included breakfast (toast and jam/ peanut butter). The location isn't great as you have to get buses everywhere, but as we were out for each entire day this wasn't too much hassle as the hostel provided info on what buses to get where and when.", "Date": "Aug 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR923541436", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "BSBond"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d626254-r21087657-Fern_Loft_Hostel_Singapore_East_Coast_Branch-Singapore.html", "HotelID": "626254", "Price": "\" id=\"hotel_626254\">"}}
