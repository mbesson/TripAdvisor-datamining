This did two things: (1) got us away from the train noise that everyone had complained about if you stay in the other tower that faces the train tracks with all the incessant dinging of the crossing rails and the blowing of the train horns, and (2) got a great view of the harbor in a serviceable (but dated) room, with a balcony. In fact, we woke the next morning to find the ship we were to sail on pointed directly at us, since it docked on the same pier we were facing.

I was so put off by her rudeness that I was about to call a manager over when my traveling companion simply pulled me away and reminded me that the management and front desk really wouldn't care.

Everything started out ok, easy check-in, pleasant staff at the front desk. Once in the room we found that the balcony door was stuck and would only open a few inches. It also would not close properly. That night was very windy so we were awake most of the night listening to the door rattle. We could also hear everything that went on in the hallways. We had booked a room that included breakfast, so the next morning went down to the restaurant with our coupon. After being seated, the waitress came by and on seeing the coupon, grabbed our menus and told us we didn't have any choice about what we would be served other than the manner in which our eggs would be cooked. She also made it very clear and I do mean VERY clear that the coupon did not include her tip. Great start to the day, but when we returned to our room it got better yet, since our keycards wouldn't work. The maid was in the hallway and when we told her the problem she said there was nothing she could do and the problem was caused by carrying the keycards close to a cell phone. Interesting observation inasmuch as my wife's keycard was never near her phone and I don't carry a cell phone. To rectify the problem we had to go back down to the front desk. There were only two people on duty to handle people checking in and out and no one who could handle this sort of problem. As a result we had to wait in line for over half an hour to address the issue. When we did manage to speak to someone she couldn't understand how this could happen and seemed to think we didn't know how to work a door handle. We told her the maid's story about the cell phones and suddenly all was clear for her, yes indeed the problem was caused by cell phones. The fact that I don't carry one and that my wife's phone was never near the keycard didn't matter, the problem had been solved. All we had to do was go back to our room and she would send someone up to deal with the matter. I indicated that I wasn't too pleased to have to wait in a line for over half an hour to discuss the problem and that I wasn't going to stand around in the hallway waiting for someone to show up. She then decided that she could issue new keycards. We returned to the room and miraculously the cards worked. We got ready to go out, waited around a bit, but no one ever did show up at our room, at least not while we were there. Went out for the day and also went out for dinner that evening. That night we again could hear everyone entering and exiting their rooms, every noise in the hall as well as the ship arriving and a variety of announcements made by the ship's staff. Next morning same rigamarole re breakfast although different waitress who didn't make an issue out of her tip. Easy check-out via voicemail. The quality of the room, the decor and the service for the price charged will ensure that we don't ever return to this hotel.

The hotel does have an free airport shuttle which goes every half hour but we ended up taking a taxi since we arrived in the parking lot just in time to see the shuttle go down the ramp. The taxi cost $10 plus only took about 10-15 minutes to the hotel and really gave us a jump to start visiting the San Diego area. Upon our arrival, yes the hotel does look a little tired from the outside but when we eventually got to our room we found it to be clean and the room was more than ample with pleasant decor. We arrived about noon and were able to check-in right away. The only down side was the room did not have a bar fridge which would have been welcome as we had bought some water and drinks for the room. Our room was on the thrid floor at the end of the hallway so we found it to be quite quiet. We did not find the trains to be noticeable that we couldn't sleep. We did not have an opportunity to try the pool but the water was quite warm so it must be heated. The best part I thought was the balcony off our room which we sat to have morning coffee and watched the hustle bustle at the cruise dock. It gave us a good vantage point to see when it would be right to head over. Why would anyone sign up for the hotel to pier shuttle from the hotel - it literally took us about 10 minutes to walk across the street - deposit our luggage at the pier and walked straight into the boarding gates. We were able to walk over to the US Midway quite easily and stopped to have lunch at the new deli just a block from the hotel, I believe it was called Halswells. Food was reasonable and more than ample to the point we were able to share an entree quite easily between us. We also have our dinner down at the Elephant & Castle in the hotel and found the burgers to be filling. Our waiter was most efficient considering the area and patrons he was caring for. Best sense of humor we have seen in a while - good ambassador. We also found the hotel within walking distance (25 minutes) to the main downtown Horton Plaza shopping mall.

I have had rooms in all 3 buildings, facing in both directions, so I feel I have had a good cross-section of rooms. I don't dislike the area (across from cruise ship terminal on the waterfront), but I don't rest well there. The rooms seem poorly insulated and I have had stays where I can hear every single word in the room next door. People who stay there are often going to or coming from cruises. So, they are whooping it up. It doesn't matter who they are or what age they are..they all seem to bang around and to talk loud...it's even worse when they are out on the balcony. Also you get outside noise a lot; amazingly loud commuter trains on the city-facing side (from about 5am until after midnight - it's unbelievable), people's voices in the swimming pool area echo (it's between the two main buildings and a bunch of rooms face that area), and even the rooms that face the waterfront expose you to the bells from the USS Midway, people and traffic on the sidewalks along the front of the hotel, and, worst of all, the blowing of cruise ship horns. I had to stay there during the holidays once, and there is a huge loud party on the docks right in front of the hotel. It was a difficult night. The good news is that the staff seems to know about the noise problems and is not shy about sending Security to noisy rooms, so kudos to them for that...if you get the frat boys or the family from Haites in the room above you, they will definitely go knock on the door for you, and if they have other rooms available, they will move you. So don't hesitate to complain to the management if you can't get any rest! Some other observations: If you are looking for a stylish place to stay, this is not it. If you need a tub, you're out of luck (shower only). Rooms are dated, and, lastly, you'd think that a big hotel chain like HI would realize that people need electrical outlets! All the rooms are short on electrical outlets and have multi-plug extensions on the few available ones...they are so heavily overloaded that there's no room for a large or adapter-sized plug (as in apple iphones and other devices)...and you usually have to crawl under the desk to even access the outlet expander. I often carry a netbook, too, and really need two handy plugs and I have NEVER found a room with this convenience. I end up having to plug my electronics in at the bathroom sink! Yikes. Then there's the food issue - aside from a deli between the buildings, there is no place to eat inexpensively (a bar/restaurant which is part of a pub chain is located on the property...limited menu), and Anthony's Seafood is across the street (good food but not cheap), and there is a small walk-up with burgers and quick stuff at the cruise terminal...but besides those limited options, you're going to have to hunt elsewhere for eats.

It is served in a separately operated restaurant/bar off the main lobby and the buffet, to which we have become accustomed, was non-existent. The restaurant charged for absolutely everything on an a la carte basis and we soon exceeded the $20 and had to pay the difference. Having paid for a room with breakfast included, we were disgusted by this. The food was good and we ate on the terrace outside but even that experience was spoiled by two pigeons on a nearby table devouring the remains of another couple's food. In conclusion, if you're looking for a good hotel, go elsewhere. We chose this one because our previous Holiday Inn experiences have been good, but don't waste your money on it.

This is the best location for cruisers as it is right across the street from the cruise ship terminal. It is also well located, if you do not mind walking a few blocks, to Horton Plaza, Gas Lamp, Seaport Village and Little Italy. A special mention to the concierge desk. They were flooded by dozens of people wanting to drop off or pick up luggage, obtain visitor info or answers to questions. We waited at least 10 minutes to drop off our bags. I was very impressed by how pleasant, respectful and patient they all were. Not everyone in line was very nice yet they treated everyone well. Kudos to them all! Here are the pro's and cons: PROS Great staff - every staff person we encountered was friendly, helpful and very patient: front desk, concierge, gift shop, housekeeping you name it. Nice property amenities - pretty pool, self laundry, better than usual gift shop, three restaurants on site and others close by. Location - as mentioned above good location View from room - we splurged on a bay side room. It is really cool to sit on our balcony and watch the cruise ships come in and leave. You can also see airplanes do the same thing. We saw dolphins following a boat out of the harbor in the morning! CONS Price - we booked through the hotel website as there were no deals on the usual hotel sites. Paid $160 for our bay view room. Room - we were on the third floor of tower three. It was bit noisy especially from the construction next door. While the room was large it seemed a bit dated. No microwave or fridge though there is s safe. Crowds - this is a place popular with cruisers. Cruise ships hold lots of people and it seemed that everyone on both our ship and the other ship that was in port were at the hotel. There were lineups to check in and to the concierge. There seemed to be people everywhere all of the time. I recommend this hotel if you are leaving or coming back from a cruise or plan to visit the USS MIdway or like watching the ships and planes or like a retro-vibe. There are better locations if you want to spend your time at the Gas Lamp area or if you want a \"cool\" hotel. This hotel feels like a little resort in the middle of a City.

This Holiday Inn is actually a complex, where you do your check-in in what I think was an original building with rooms, and they also have 2 other towers with rooms as well. One of the towers is attached to the old building, which was separated by conference room facilities, the other is not. Check In-I arrived around 2pm thursday afternoon, and while there was a line to check in, there were 5 people checking people in, so the line moved very rapidly. They gave me my room key, a code for the wireless internet, and a 10% discount coupon for a deli that is on the complex. They also give you shuttle pick-up times for the airport, the zoo, sea world, and a couple other locations. Shuttles are free. The room-I have read other reviews about the rooms here at the Holiday Inn, and I have to say, they are pretty spot on. I got the king sized bed, which I found firm, but not overly hard. They give you 4 square pillows, 2 firm, 2 soft. The chair, tables, and dresser are straight from the late 70's or early 80's. Yes, they are dated, but they serve their function. It's a Holiday Inn, what do people expect, Pottery Barn furniture. There was a 32\" LCD TV with about 30 channels along with the standard pay per view movies, which ran around $17 a pop. The room has its own thermostat, which ran smoothly and quietly. People have said about the thin walls. While I didn't hear any noise from my next door neighbors, I definitely heard the Amtrak train blowing it's horn every 30-45 minutes. Yes folks, I had a city view room with the Amtrak station only 1 block away, and its a very busy station. In addition to Amtrak, there was the local commuter train, and the red trolley line. And I have to admit, it got a little irritating. Hint, keep your balcony room locked, as all balconies are attached to each other, and it would be easy for a not so nice person to come from a different room from the outside to get into your room, if your balcony door was left unlocked. The Bathroom-I was up on the 12th floor of the tower that was attached to the first building, I didn't find problems getting hot water, but I found the water pressure being a little lacking. Same for the toilet, when you flushed, it took forever to complete the cycle. The bathroom was equipped with a shower only, which is not a problem for me. My opinion is, unless its a whirlpool tub, why bother. Standard sink, and hairdryer hanging on the wall. There was also a ironing board located in the bathroom closet. Hotel Overall-I don't know if it was color scheme, but the hotel just looked old. The hotel has a swimming pool and also a workout gym. The hotel also has a Elephant and Castle attached to the hotel, but is not a part of Holiday Inn. I ate there, and had fantastic meals. The Hotel also has room service, which I was told, comes out of a different kitchen. There is also a Ruth's Chris' steakhouse restaurant on the complex. As a stated earlier, I got a code at checkin for wireless internet, which was free for my entire stay, which was a pleasant surprise. I had no problems connecting, and had good coverage. The hotel is directly across for the cruise terminal, the maritime museum, and the Midway museum. The Carnival Spirit and Holland America's Statendam were leaving on my first night. The hotel is also within walking distance to the Gas Lamp Quarter section of San Diego.

The 1st was a bit better because I was in the north tower which had been recently remodeled and was just nicer than the south tower. Customer comfort, like comfortable seating, was definetly taken into account when remodelling the north tower. Still, I had few complaints. When I mentioned to the young man checking me in that I was celebrating my 65 birthday with them and would appreciate a bay view, I felt he did his best to accommodate me with a nice room on the 5th floor facing the bay even though I was there on a pretty good Expedia rate. The views of the bay, cruise ships across the street, sunsets and people were truly a plus that I constantly enjoyed from my little balcony with two chairs and a little table. This a 100% non-smoking hotel and I would suggest that if you choose to smoke on your balcony, and some do, be very discreet and considerate about it. You don't want neighbors complaining about your smoking. I have no doubt that they would charge you the fees that you initial for upon checking in if caught. One morning I woke up to 3 cruise ships docked at the terminal right across the street. What a sight that was. All wasn't perfect though. Flights start leaving the closeby airport right at 06:30 every morning which can be a bit of an unpleasant wakeup. A lot of the airport noise seems to depend on wind direction but I always noticed those early morning flight departures and the jet noise. I found all of the staff that I had dealings with to be efficient and friendly. I very much liked the deli at the base of our building. I had breakfast there a couple times which was made even better sitting outside on their patio on a warm San Diego morning. Their sandwiches are excellent. Never failed to satisfy. My only real dissatisfaction with this hotel relates to their $1.50 charge for local phone calls and $22.00 per day for parking. My rental car didn't even cost that much per day. Parking can be a real hassle if you try to use the city meters which are everywhere outside the hotel and charge 25 cents for 12 minutes which adds up. If you get a ticket for an expired meter I've been told it's over $40.00. There is a pay lot south of the hotel with an entrance off Broadway Street which charges $10.00 for up to 10 hours with no in and out privilages and served my needs a few times when I had parked overnight at the meters which kick in at 08:00 everyday expect Sunday. The rooms are adequate and very clean. Mine had a nice, new flat screen TV which my room in the north tower didn't have when I stayed there 2 years ago. The maid was most sweet and accommodating.

You can get around pretty well using the trolley with bus combination and everyone we met was very helpful telling us what bus or trolley to use. I do wish we had paid to use the Old Town Trolley. It was everywhere we went and you can hop on and off all day. It even goes to Coronado Island. We took the Ferry and then had to take a cab to the Coronado Hotel and the beach. The Old Town Trolley passed by while we were waiting for a cab. If you don't know your way around (like us) I think that is the way to go. The pedicabs are a nice way to get around at night. We met a pedicab driver close to the Ferry and he took us to the Gaslamp Quarter that evening and gave us a tour of the area on the way ... look up Mr. Ed - he's wonderful.

Usually those rooms are pretty expensive since you have a great view (and it really is great, it was one of the few good things). We arrived around 1 am after driving all night and I waited in the car while my husband went to check in. I waited 30 minutes and when he finally came out, I discovered that the Concierge had been sleeping (understandable) but when woken up did not immediately help my husband check in and when he finally got around to it, in the middle he walked off and was gone for 10 minutes or so before he came back and finished. No explanation was given. We found out that the guest parking was around the corner so we had to pull back out into the road to get to the garage and then discovered that we would get a ticket and would have to pay for parking when we checked out. We finally get into our section of the hotel and call up the elevator and I thought I was going to die. It was slow, shaky and smelled bad. We got to our room and were settling in when we then realized we had no refrigerator or microwave. I was a little ticked, needless to say. Also, when we went to find the ice machine it was missing. My husband called the Front Desk and they just said each floor had one. We ended up having to go up or down a floor to get ice. Another issue was the restaurants in the area; there was a Ruth's Chris, a British pub-like restaurant and a small deli. Not a lot of options. We decided to try Ruth's Chris because I knew someone who had eaten there once and liked it. I really wish my acquaintance had mentioned how expensive it was. We each got a magnificent steak for about $48 each then we ordered Asparagus for about $9-$12. Turns out each side item is a la carte. The food really was amazing but you can only eat there if you're not on a budget. British food is good, but I wasn't really feeling it during my trip. The Deli was good, but it was just your average Deli. The only really amazing thing was our view of the Bay.

The location of this hotel cannot be faulted, close to the airport and within easy reach of Downtown. On our second stay we paid extra for a room with a view over the Bay (12th floor), which was wonderful, although we hadn't allowed for the loud noise from the air conditioning units on the low roof opposite us which made sleep almost impossible. The hotel also provides a really useful free shuttle bus service between the airport and a few other key tourist locations, like the zoo, which runs regularly. There were a few silly ommissions such as milk to go with the coffee in the room, another really useful facility by the way. And long waits for the elevators which are under repair. Unfortunately, our dissatisfaction lay with the surly and curt staff that we encountered on both stays. On the first occasion when we asked if the concierge had a local map, without a word he slapped one on the counter and turned his back on us before we could speak, and started a conversation with another guest. Any thoughts of asking for help were put to bed and we moved on. We pointed out that our bill included 2 days of the valet service instead of 1 (an expensive service at $28 per day), the emotionless Receptionist fumbled with her keyboard for a good five minutes in complete silence before printing of a new bill and leaving it on the counter - an apology was clearly out of the question. When we asked if we could keep our room for one extra hour beyond check out. The same Receptionist didn't consult with anyone or check her screen even, the answer was simply \"no, that's not possible\". After spending 4 reasonably expensive nights at the hotel and entertaining friends and family within the hotel restaurants, I didn't feel that one extra hour was a lot to ask for, and it would have made our transfer to the airport that much more comfortable as we could have used the time available in a more relaxed fashion. There was also an occasion when I stood infront of 2 chatting receptionists for about 2 minutes, waiting to ask a question, not once did they acknowledge me, look at me or of course stop talking. I moved to another counter to be served. What makes me laugh about all of this is that on check in they insist on thanking you for being a member of their Preferred Client scheme, but then after this you're on your own and nothing backs this up. On this same trip we stayed in several other hotels in California and received outstanding service from genuinely helpful staff. I nearly forgot, I don't like to complain after the event, so prior to check out I rang to speak to the Duty Manager to let her know what had gone on.

The restaurant was good- had outdoor seating that we took advantage of. The room was good. Smaller room with pretty good use of space. Bathroom small with shower only- no tub. Hotel is older- but in good repair. My biggest complaint would have to be the elevators. There are 14 floors and three elevators. One was out of service. the glass elevator can only be called from the ground floor- leaving ONE to service the entire hotel when calling from your floor. Also, there seemed to be some sort of glitch because they stopped at essentially every floor even when no one was there calling for it (not once, not twice, all the time!). I think that the rate descrepency bothers me the most- more than $50/night in variance among our party of 4. I think that is a really high variance. I called the hotel and left a message, but as of yet the call has not been returned. The restaurant across the street was great Anthony's- fish place. Internet was free and was reliable.

Our arrival at the hotel was a couple of hours earlier than check-in but our room was ready which was nice.

The hotel has a great gift shop, quite large, and we were pleased to see that they also had a nice selection of wines to choose from.

Our room had a bathtub, large turnaround area in the bathroom area and plenty of well-placed grab bars. The sink/vanity and mirror were just outside the bathroom door. This was very handy for us both getting ready at the same time. The height of the bed was perfect for transferring in and out of our wheelchairs. The hotel also offers a courtesy shuttle which is equipped with a lift. There were plenty of grassy areas just outside the door for the service dog. Coming into the room we were pleasantly surprised to be placed on the bayside where we had a beatiful view. I also was not expecting the wonderful balcony which was large enough for my wheelchair to roll completely outside. The hotel itself has a bright sunny exterior color which fit perfectly on the bay environment. Interiror, its public areas and hallways do need a bit of sprucing up and cleaning. Nothing major and certainly nothing that would keep me from recommending it to anyone. Mainly I just remember ceiling tiles and vents being dirty and the hallways having a slight musty smell. Nothing a good cleaning and air freshener system would not cure. The rest of the hotel was spotless. Every employee we encountered was nothing but top notch and went out of their way to help.

There are not enough parking spaces for 1/2 of the hotel, you have to drive around and around and around looking for a space that hopefully your car can fit in and get that you can out of your car.

I thought to myself \"How bad could it be?\" It was \"Holiday Inn\" after all. You know, I'm not one to complain very often and this is also my first review of any hotel. I thought I owed it to everyone out there trying to decide what to do because I'd actually feel guilty if I didn't. With that said, here goes. I'm from Alberta, Canada and we were taken a Cruise out from San Diego and flew in a few days prior and we needed to stay somewhere for a day after the cruise was over. It seemed like a logical choice being right across the street from where the ship ports. We got into our room on the 8th floor in the South Tower. The room was clean but seemed to have gone through much wear and tear. No big Deal. Just not really nice in my opinion. (i.e. scratches and chips on the furniture, carpets in so-so shape, old t.v.'s, poorly conditioned sitting chairs etc. etc.) The Next thing, which everyone check's out is the bed. The bed was very uncomfortable, lumpy, and the pillows weren't that great and seemed somewhat small for a King. If you are someone who needs a comfortable sleep, I would think twice. Onward. It was rather hot the first day in and the next thing we did was turn on the Air Conditioner. It turned on and hot air came out. We gave it about 15 minutes and still only hot air blowing out. We called the front desk and the guy came out and said it needed to be turned on. He turned it on and the Air Conditioner started to work. \"Great\" we thought.. Until later that night we heard a \"drip, drip, drip\" in a pool on the floor. We called up the Front Desk a second time. They sent the maintenance guy again. He said, \"Oh, this one has had issues and it's actually been draining in a \"temporary bucket\" and the bucket is now over flowing\". I'm going \"peachy\". So, he goes an empties the bucket of water and on we go with the night. Well, we start to get to sleep around 11pm on our not so comfortable bed and all of a sudden we hear a \"drip, drip drip\" again in double time drips. I'm a patient guy but this time I'm just a little bit cranky and they gave us a choice to move rooms. We did of course. We moved to the North Tower and the air conditioner worked but the bed still sucked. We went on the cruise. Came Back and got our room again. This time on the 7th floor in the South Tower again. Bed was STILL was not very comfortable for the third time.. The air conditioner worked, which we didn't need because it was a cooler night but we just need to make the night. I REALLY wanted to sleep in because of all the days were doing excursions on our cruise we stayed really busy and were up early for one reason or another. Well, we got into bed, turned off the t.v. and then realized you could hear water running through the walls from somewhere. It wasn't just a little bit and it wasn't someone just turning on the tap or something. This was constant from the time we went to bed to the time we got up in the morning. I stayed in the room because I thought it would go off soon enough and it kept on waking me up all night. I was so bitter the next morning. I didn't complain because I just wanted to get out of there. Let's Recap: Uncomfortable, Water Leaks, Running Water in the Walls, Much Wear and Tear, and Generally not that nice. The Pro: Right Next to Ship Port Tip: Don't be afraid to use the Shuttle at a Different Hotel to make it to the port if you're taking a cruise for instance. The extra 15 - 30 minutes it'll take you to get ready in the morning and get there will be worth it if you get a good sleep somewhere else. P.S. - Did I mentioned the elevators seemed a little off? Seemed old and not very smooth running. (i.e. loud and/or bumpy) When you reached the floor on one of them the door took forever to open and it left you thinking you might be stuck for a split second. I'm sure they're fine by certain standards but it's one of those things you'd have to ride in and judge for yourself. Just my opinion. Again, this review isn't exaggerated. It's just my view of the experience and hope it helps you in making your decision.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBlah, if you can afford better go there\u201d", "Author": "Babaramdass", "ReviewID": "UR102942192", "Content": "The location is excellent - close to the airport, cruise ships, harbor.

To quote him he said: \"You said the main tower! You gotta get your towers right!\" He proceeded to say this a few times as if we should should know their lingo for what they call the towers. I have to mention they have various names for each tower as well so it's not like there is a definite name for each one! He stubbornly looked at what they had in the tower we requested and as he is doing this, my girlfriend is even apologizing for any incovenience that we caused him, even though she didn't have to and he just completely ignored her! Once he is about done giving us keys for a new room in a threatening sarcastic way says multiple times \"Are you going to be happy with this?!\" This guy apparantly has no idea what customer service is and left a bad taste in our mouth for the rest of our stay in this hotel. On a side note, the elevators at this hotel are terrible as they shake and we even got stuck in one for a few minutes.

The sliding door didn't stay put and so we had to put a shoe up against it to stop it from sliding back. The door also stood away from the frame about an inch.

At the price the room was, I expected to have enough toiletries without having to take my own or buy them. * the only hair dryer was one of those nailed to the wall with the puff power of an asthmatic. With three of us queuing for the bathroom, it was frustrating that the only hair dryer was in there, along with the wardrobe (with the world's smallest supply of coathangers for three people). * The walls were thin. The very annoying guy in the room next door also had a very loud voice. At 7am, we could hear every word of his phone conversation. * The room did not have a safe. We used one for free in reception but what a pain to have to keep popping downstairs to pick things up or drop things off. As a result, we did risk security more than we would by leaving stuff in the room that we would have usually locked in a room safe. The room did have a good sized balcony, overlooking the Bay and the pool. The TV worked ok, though seemed to have limited stations. It had an iron and ironing board and a reasonable shower, though no bath.

We had a room fronting the bay and had none of the noise issues (trolley and planes taking off) that people facing the city had. The view of the bay was great. Another plus is that the hotel is also very close to a lot of attractions (Seaport Village, USS Midway, historic ships, Coronado Ferry, Gaslamp district) that we were able to walk to. I also liked being able to run along the bay in the morning. We liked the hotel's shuttle service to/from airport and the zoo, but wished they would add another drop off and pick up time for attractions in mid-afternoon. We took the 9 a.m. shuttle to the zoo. Next shuttle pick up was 11:20 which would have been too soon. The shuttle pick up after that one was 4:20. We were done before that and ended up taking a taxi back to the hotel which cost us $13. Breakfast is not provided and I think for the price, they could offer something complimentary to guests. I don't understand how similar hotels in that price range (Residence Inn by Marriott and Holiday Inn Express) offer free breakfasts but the Holiday Inn doesn't. We ate one morning at the Elephant and Castle. Breakfast for 2 was $30. Other mornings I ended up walking to Ralph's Grocery Store on G Street and bought yogurts, milk and fruit. They also had some hot breakfast sandwiches. At a $1.99 my son really enjoyed the croissant egg and cheese sandwich. It ended up being a lot cheaper than eating out every morning. The room itself was decent size. I agree with the others who said it seemed a little odd to have the closet in the bathroom. The frosted sliding glass was also a little different. Wireless internet is a nice plus but it was a very slow connection. The business center only allowed you to print boarding passes for free. Otherwise there is a charge. Although it was relatively cool when we visited, the two exercise rooms were extremely hot. Something needs to be done about the ventilation in there. My son would work out for about an hour lifting weights and come back to the room completely drenched. Staff seemed average. Not overly friendly but not rude either.

We arrived on Saturday afternoon well before game time in order to check into the hotel, get situated, and grab some cocktails and food. Both the valet and check-in process was quick and painless which is always a good way to start a stay at a hotel. Upon check-in we learned that we were gold member\u2019s b/c the person who made the reservation for us is a big Holiday Inn guy. We were given a room in the South Tower, on the 11th floor, facing the bay. The room was nice enough with a small but adequate balcony with two chairs and a small table. The bed was very comfortable and I liked the variety of (soft/firm) pillows that is offered. The water pressure in the shower is very good and the shower provides good space in the otherwise small bathroom. The best part of the room is the view. If you have to pay a bit more for a room with a view of the water, I would recommend it. Not only is the view good but the people watching is also very entertaining. The two things that were sub par in the room was the outdated television, which most other hotels in the area have already updated, and the air conditioning. The a/c was making a banging sound throughout the night but it needed to remain on to the cool the room as well as for that constant noise while sleeping. Probably just something related to this room in particular but annoying none the less. The worst thing about the hotel was the elevators in the south tower. Two out of the three elevators gave a very bumpy and unsettling ride while going up and especially going down. The certificates of operation and maintenance were out of date as well. Not sure if one had anything to do with the other but it was not a good experience in the elevator. Overall, the Holiday Inn was good but not great.

King bed was not a \"heavenly bed\" but was perfectly comfortable. TV is an old-style CRT not a flat screen that many nicer hotels have gotten. Free wireless internet in the rooms and the lobby (worked fine for me, I used it a lot), if you have a laptop or iphone. The hotel is also well located: close the airport and the downtown area and across the street (literally) from the cruise terminal. The front desk staff are friendlier and more helpful than average, but they can get busy (as can the concierge) , and check-in seems to be slow, not because the front desk people are slow but because the hotel seems not to have streamlined their check-in procedures for the 21st century yet. Your experience at the Holiday Inn On The Bay will probably vary depending on which kind of room you get (whether you are in the north tower, south tower, or main building that is above the lobby) and whether it faces the city or the bay. When I checked in, I specifically asked for a quiet room; I wonder how many who have complained about noise in their reviews here did that? I knew from reading these reviews about the city side being the \"train side\" (freight trains all night) so I specifically asked for one not on that side. I checked in early before 3PM check-in so I had to wait a bit for a room; the first one had some noise in the AC or something so when I went back and asked for another room, they gave me one facing the bay (I specifically told them I wanted quiet more than the view - but I got both). The front desk staff people were helpful and patient with me as I asked to change rooms initially when I checked in. (It helps to check in closer to 3PM and not super late in the evening when many of the rooms are occupied.) I got a king room, and I saw the basic king room in both the north and south towers because I changed rooms as described above. The south tower room had a classic tub/shower and a conventional door, plus the room had a little dining table and a chair or two. The north tower room (in which I wound up staying) had been \"updated\" and had only a shower in the bathroom plus that goofy sliding door (not sound-resistant like a regular door is and fogged glass the whole length of the door). Plus my room had only a desk and office chair plus a recliner chair - no little dining table. Some people definitely won't care for that bathroom type, so if you think that will be an issue, ask for a room in the south tower. I was staying alone so it wasn't an issue, and I actually kind of liked the bathroom style. I didn't hear any train noise because I was facing the bay (9th floor, great view!), but being close to the airport, you can definitely hear the roar of airplanes taking off, especially after 6am. You probably can hear planes to some extent at many downtown hotels in San Diego. The noise didn't bother me. The AC unit allows the fan to be set to \"high\" manually so you can use that to generate some white noise, something I often do at almost any hotel. As for the location: while it may not be steps from the highlights of the Gas Lamp district like some of the downtown hotels, the hotel is still in an excellent location. Most people will tell you you HAVE to rent a car in San Diego, but it's possible to do without one if you stay at this Holiday Inn. First of all, you can just walk to things - cruise terminal, Little Italy (great Italian food, pizza, etc.) and a few other restaurants, Seaport Village, even downtown and the Gaslamp (a fairly long walk but very doable if you are in good walking shape). You are close to the ferry over to Coronado Island. There's also the hotel shuttle; I think it will take you to Seaworld or the Zoo, but I didn't use the shuttle at all except to get to and from the airport. In addition, San Diego has an excellent public transportation system: a trolley (light rail train), a commuter train (Coaster train north up to Oceanside and Encinitas) and Amtrak - and you are just a few blocks from the Santa Fe train station (also a trolley station). And while many people dismiss city buses, San Diego's are quire good - they are clean and seemed to run on time; I used them extensively along with the trolley. If you have a netbook or an iphone with you, you can use Google Maps/Google Transit to figure out how to get anywhere in town, without ever needing to fumble for a paper schedule; just type in the starting and ending points (not even the addresses, just the places and it will find them). For example, the #992 bus originates downtown a few blocks from the heart of the Gaslamp and drops you steps from the Holiday Inn hotel lobby (and on to the airport if you miss the shuttle or something). I took the buses all the way up to Pacific Beach, La Jolla, and even Del Mar (and the Coaster up to Encinitas). While the train costs extra, you can get an unlimited MTS day pass (as of March 2010) for only $5 per day or $12 for three days - and that includes buses all the way up to North County. Yes, the bus rides can be long, but at least you don't have to worry about parking a car, driving in traffic, finding your way around, fueling up the car before returning to the airport, or paying the cost to drive and park a car. After a day of sightseeing, you can look out the window or just close your eyes instead of driving. So if you don't want to rent a car, you don't have to - or just rent one for a day or two, which is what I planned to do (rental car places near the airport are not far from the hotel), but after the first day without a car, I found it easy enough to get around that I didn't even bother renting a car at all. Anyway, I enjoyed my stay at the Holiday Inn On The Bay - I got a fantastic deal the way many other people do, so I felt it was a terrific bargain. It's not the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in - there are far nicer in San Diego, but it was decent enough. If I had to pay full price at the Holiday Inn I'd probably look elsewhere, but if I got a good deal again I'd love to stay here again.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cOnly for a pre cruise stay\u201d", "Author": "Nekolover", "ReviewID": "UR58137833", "Content": "This was a standard Holiday Inn, except I thought the price was very expensive for what I was getting.

As I stayed here for work, I could not request a room change. I can see where having the balcony would've been a big plus as the rooms are TINY. They are long and narrow, which puts the bed very close to the door/bathroom and far away from the window. The main building rooms are clearly some of the last to be updated as mine had noticeably dated and scratched fixtures, ancient TV, carpet & furniture. They provided tiny 0.5 oz bottles...barely enough for one use...of shampoo and lotion (Bath & Body Works Coconut Lime) but no hair conditioner. The room service menu was of poor selection and ridiculously priced ($17 for a chicken ceasar salad PLUS delivery charge and 18% gratuity). The bartending staff at the in-hotel Elephant & Castle restaurant was quite rude & inefficient. The in house gift shop is INSANELY overpriced. $2.50 for a snack-sized bag of pretzels, $2 for a 20 oz soda, $7 for a cheaply made \"San Diego\" magnet...etc. There were no snack vending machines in the hotel either, so bring your own munchies. The ice machine on my floor did not work all week despite telling the staff. Finally, the biggest negative...THE NOISE. Unless you pass out dead away when you sleep, the noise will affect you. Cars, sirens, trains, ship bells & horns, thin room walls, outside chatter of people on their balconies. The ship horns near the dinner hour every day were so loud that I actually had to stop my phone conversation. Also beware if you are not from the area that there are many, many transients (\"bums\") that ask for spare change. The hotel does keep them off premises, but the second you walk off hotel property, you will get confronted. The positive of my stay was having things to walk to (Starbucks, shopping, restaurants).

Unfortunately it also had several things that made me decide I would most likely never stay there again, and I will continue to avoid the Holiday Inn chain. As many other people mentioned it has a great location and you can walk to everything including the trolly/metro which is great if you want to avoid the pricey cabs. We had an easy walk to seaport village and a nice mall downtown, as well as many different places to eat. I thought they did a good job with the conference as far as stocking the room with food, regulating the temp, etc. I liked the lobby area and they have a great little pub. We had no problems with the shuttle service and the drivers were nice. They came and went as promised and on schedule. The room was located in the south tower and it was clean. The beds were pretty comfortable. The free wireless was great. Other than that it is very very no frills. My biggest complaints are the customer service and the noise. At about 9:00 every night we could hear a lot of banging and dragging of furniture from somewhere near us. It was definately not guest noise...it sounded like renovations or something the hotel was doing. It started promply at 9 every night and ended around 10:30 or 11. It was very loud and annoying, so I called one night. They played dumb and said they had no knowledge of anything going on that would cause such loud noises. Basically they had a very we-don't-care attitude. Also you will hear lots of beeping and honking and car alarms, as well as typical port noises, so just be aware that this hotel is in NOT in a quiet area. I know many of these noises cannot be helped, but slamming furniture around? I asked other people at my conference and they heard it too. Very strange. Another thing that sealed the deal for me and made me decide I would not come back is when I came down to the front desk to ask a quick question. I noticed one of the concierge workers was being very short and rude to the people in front of me. I waited patiently in line, and when it came my turn, they guy stared down at his computer and ignored me for at least 10 minutes. Finally someone else came over to ask if I had been helped. He never once looked up from the computer. Bottom line...if you tolerate noise well and you just need a clean bed to sleep in...and don't much care for nice pools and luxury...this is your place.

The hotel did a pick up on graduation day, but the driver didn't know what time to show, was late, and would not let everyone on the bus even though it was half empty. Another service they offered was laundry. Well, the washers were broken, so no laundry. Our toilet backed up twice, once prompting a 12:15 AM maintenance call. The shower curtain rod was broken, causing the curtain to constantly slide toward the middle, therefore spilling water out of the front and back of the tub.

Location is great though, walking distance to lots of attractions, shopping, waterfront, restaurants, etc. One can even take a ride on a bike cart taxi service, cute at first but they become a real pain after a while approaching you for business. They use a right in your face approach, and after 50 times being asked it got very annoying. Room service expensive, add on an 18% service fee, plus delivery charge.

The pub next door (elephant and castle) tries to be a british pub - with food on a american / british theme - the bar is ok gets quite full and is fine for a few drinks after a long day or prior to going out into the gas lamp area. The restaurant is very very slow - it can take an hour to get your food once ordered and dont think of orderig a drink as sometimes they just dont appear but you do get charge. Although our food was ok (once arriving) many people did complain about the quality of the food. For some reason if you sat at the bar - your drinks and food arrived very quickly and was excellent. There is a ruth/chris steak house next door - very pricy - never saw that many people eat there. Overall this hotel is very good - fantastic location - very central to get to most places - the rooms are comfy and welcoming and clean. San diego is a fantastic place to visit - people are friendly and the city and area beautiful - be aware that san diego is spread out and you will need to travel to get to most areas. for balboa park fashion valley mall down town old town can easily be reached using the metro system (bus and tram system) very cheap and reliable To get to the beaches or legoland and sea world you really need a car.", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Welshtotty", "ReviewID": "UR20695188", "Content": "I ended up staying here unexpectantly last week for 2 nights, they managed to fit me in, i had a room on the 11th floor of the main tower facing the town.

Finally, I did read them, but only after it was too late to cancel my reservations. So, I prepared myself accordingly. I used the self-parking ($20). One part of the parking structure was filled with construction material (they are still updating their rooms). The structure could have been cleaner (floor and smell). The front desk was friendly and helpful. I reserved a bay view room. After I inquired, they were able to move my room from the 2nd floor to the 4th floor in the main building, however, both rooms were next to the elevator (which I read was extremely noisy). The room was small, but clean, with a neutral decor (and popcorn ceiling). No refrigerator or microwave. The bathroom was a fair size, but the vanity area was very small. The shower head had adequate pressure. As for noise, throughout my two-night stay, I heard the elevator only twice. I found the walls to be thick and insulating, however, the front door, although sturdy, did not stop much of the hallway noise (not sure if this is by design). The sliding glass door needed to be upgraded. It did an OK job at reducing the street traffic noise and most of the bay horns, but I had to lean a chair against it to make a good seal against the fixed part of the window. Being on the bay side of the main building, I did not hear the train horns; but outside of the building, they are loud; also the cruise line horn is very loud (but does not blast much and not at night), and there is a tall ship that shoots its cannons during its tour around the bay (actually, very cool to see). Housekeeping was responsive for a call for extra bath towels. The hotel pub's food was good, and little expensive. And Ruth's Chris Steak House had very friendly service and great food, although it was very expensive. Within walking distance were my destination, USS Midway (about a 7 minute walk), and Seaport Village (about a 12 minute walk). I had a good experience at this hotel; it has a good location and good view of the bay. I would stay there again, depending on my needs, but I would probably try another hotel nearby first (just to see what it was like).

The staff dosen't seem to care much about serving you unless you get up and talk to the manager. Not only was that the case with us but we took note of several other tables having the same issue. There is a little bakery by the South Tower that has great breakfast food and good prices. Much better deal than the hotel pub. Even though the kids eat free at the hotel, we spent over $10 less at this place. Parking cost is a bummer but that is the same everywhere.

I had read the previous reviews so had an idea that certain sides/towers were to be avoided, and thought I had paid extra for a bay view. We ended up with a room directly over the entrance canopy, next to the lifts, and the bay was indeed visible through the flags and buses pulling up - just. When I asked if there was a room higher up, I was met with the indifference mentioned so often in these reviews - in short, no way. We then went across the road for dinner in a fish restaurant which was hugely popular (although we couldn't for the life of us see why). However, somewhat jet lagged after our 11 hour flight, we left and headed for bed. Now, I would have thought we could have slept through most things that night, but this place IS REALLY NOISY. There was some horrendous and regular booming noise which at first sounded like a ship's fog horn, but after repeated opportunities to guess the source, sounded more like some kind of electric pump coming from inside the hotel. Add to this the lift noise, the outside noise from people arriving, airplanes, women screaming in delight at meeting each other in the coridor at 1.00pm and general air conditioning, toilet flushing, ... OK, you get the picture. Breakfast was a very strange affair in a mock British pub. For those of you familiar with the real thing, you will know they are not conducive to 'in the cold light of day' breakfasting. In fact, most British pubs should be avoided until well after mid-day, and preferebaly visited only in subdued lighting. The ambiance and decor was matched by the food. We became very British indeed (after all, it purported to be a British establishment) and exclaimed loudly when told they had no ordinary tea. Thistle, raspberry, dahlia cuttings, but no real tea. Fortunately, I recalled we had been left 2 tea bags by the coffee pot in the room (??) so I retrieved those and eeked them out in war-time fashion. The only good thing I have to say about this hotel is after breakfast, we were able to wheel our cases across the road and walk straight on to the ship, which we had seen arriving earlier. That part at least was very convenient. Though why on earth anyone would stay here who wasn't going on a cruise is beyond me. On our way home, we were delayed due to the late arrival of the ship. We missed our flights and had to stay a further night in San Diego. Needless to say we avoided the Holiday Inn like the plague. We ended up staying at the Sheraton ,closer to the airport. Other people in the same situation stayed at the Embassy Suites, Days Inn, etc - all equally convenient although perhaps a little more money in some cases, but worth the short taxi ride to the cruise pier and ten times nicer than this hotel.

We were on the opposite side of the tower away from the train and it still woke me up. 2. The building is NOISY. It's old, so the walls must not have been built with the latest soundproofing, so you can hear EVERY noise that's going on around you, especially at 3 AM when the train wakes you up and you're having a hard time falling back asleep. 3.

I hope they took care of the problem, because the pressure wash we saw did not. Also, if you plan to avoid the cats by parking upstairs, exposed to the sun, be sure you can go down stairs as the only safe way down is the stairs. We had our two children asleep in strollers and were not happy about the lack of a pedestrian ramp. For future comic con attendees, be careful about the shuttle. There is a stop right outside the hotel and it worked great for two days. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday however the shuttles were too full to pick up passengers and just drove by. We missed the Lost panel waiting for a bus for 40 minutes before we decided to drive and park at the Petco stadium lot. VERY disappointing. We had to drive and use the Petco lot for three days. It was that or pay a pedicab because the trolleys were also full and did not pick up passengers. These were just our experiences and should not be taken as a complete diss of this hotel.

The elevator got a bit noisy, so we did use earplugs. Other than that, there was no sound from the trains. We heard an occasional airplane, but the view made it so worth it. The room was clean....on the small side, but we were still able to fit a crib (provided by the hotel free of charge) without a problem. The bathroom is tiny, but sufficient.

In the meantime, we had a south tower room on the 5th floor. It wasn't bad but the bayview was not as great. The hotel has complimentary wireless internet connection which worked great for us. On Sunday we were able to move to room 1463 in the north tower which had spectacular views of the bay. It was a corner room and more updated than the first one we had but it was smaller. We experienced great service from the front desk and our housekeeping maid. Our only complaint was the room service. We had to call twice to get softer pillows and twice to get more hangers never received the hangers. The noise from the airport did not bother us but we are used to living near the airport so I can see how this might bother some people. You must reserve a bayview if you want to avoid the train noise since the cityview rooms all face the train station. We recommend the following places for meals: Elephant & Castle if you want waiter service but the best bet for breakfast in my opinion is Hazelwoods Deli right underneath the south tower and next to Ruth Chris'. They serve breakfast from 6 to 11 a.m. and it's very affordable especially for large families.

No problem -- they checked us in and actually gave us an upgrade (sign up for the reward program -- I received a bayview room on the 10th Floor of the tower [connected to the lobby] for $145 night.) Every single person that worked at the hotel from the front desk folks to the valet parking attendants to the cleaning crew at the pool were friendly and helpful. The parking cost is $18/day for self-park or $22/day for valet parking. All with in/out service. We did have an issue with our drain in the shower (didn't work properly) -- fixed promptly, and an issue with our front door -- you had to pull really hard to make it shut. I met others at the hotel who were complaining about their room locks as well -- so just be careful and double check that it's locked when you leave. There is a restaurant in the hotel lobby -- the Elephant and Castle -- very good food, reasonable prices and fast. The kids loved that they could play pool in the bar area until 9:00pm. There is also a well-stocked gift shop that is open from 6:00am until 11:00pm each day. The location of the hotel is ideal. You are right on the harbor -- with easy access to I-5 and downtown via city streets. The view is spectacular and although you can notice the noise if you're sitting on the balcony (yes, the planes and trains do make noise pretty regularly) I didn't notice too much interruption during the night (plus the hotel provides ear plugs, if you're inclined.) Also, one strange thing was that the balconies of the hotel are interrconnected -- hard to explain, except that there is no real divider between them and what does divide them could be easily climbed over, so you need to be conscious of this and not leave your balcony door unlocked and also make sure you are dressed appropriately if you go out on the balcony and don't want to be surprised by your neighbor sitting two feet away with a very small fence separating you. The pool was heated, although not enough for me! The kids loved it. It was clean and plenty of towels. Mainly populated with business folks. Also, there is free internet service throughout the hotel, and a computer with a printer in the lobby for $5.95/15 minutes. Although we had a rental car, there was numerous shuttles to the airport, zoo, Horton Plaza and the Seaport Village -- we didn't use them, but the shuttles were always around and others seemed to be using them.

The front desk treated me no differently even though I booked a discounted room on the internet. They even gave me a nicer room than I asked for with a great city view. If I have a negative about the hotel, it would probably be the plain and undersized pool and no hot tub. The parking charge of $18/day is obscene, although there is a large parking lot directly north of the hotel that only charges $5 a day on the weekend.

We checked in on Thursday, and were given a room on the 7th floor. I mentioned our anniversary, and next thing I knew, we were given a room on the TOP floor (14th) in the main tower over looking the bay - we had the corner room. Big thanks to the Hotel Regisrar! About 10 minutes after check in, the hotel sent us a complimentary bottle of sparkeling wine (Cal version of champagne). The view was AMAZING - we sat on the balcony, sipping our wine and watched the boats and ships sail across the bay, the planes land and take off at Lindburgh Field (San Diego Int'l Airport), and people walking along the boardwalk. The Star of India is right across the street, next to one of our favorite restaurants, Anthony's, where we ate dinner later that night. We did not use the pool, the parking is $18 per night, which may seem steep, but you have in and out priveledges. You can walk to 7-11, many restaurants (Jack in the Box, Anthony's, Little Italy) -there are numerous pedicabs to take you anywhere in Downtown - most of the pedicabbers work just on tips and will give you a great tour. We had a great time. The street traffic and airport add some \"noise\" but it is a white noise that didn't bother us at all. The view was worth the bayside price increase. Try to get above the 9th floor. Our room was CLEAN and had very new furnishings, carpet, curtains. We are already talking about our next visit.

The other great hotel is the Radisson in La Jolla, which has beautiful grounds. It's far away from the main part of San Diego but near UCSD, La Jolla, La Jolla Beaches, etc. Be sure to try the La Valencia hotel's Sunday brunch but most important, get reservations (and directions) to the well-hidden (and a bit hard to find) but amazing Marine Room. Great ambiance and food (if a trifle pricey), it has a small jazz band for dancing but it is RIGHT ON THE OCEAN. The waves literally lap at it.
