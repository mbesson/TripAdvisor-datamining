Yes, we should have been wary because of some of the other negative reviews, but we took a chance. We got to this hotel and saw the lounge, which is not pretty looking. Rather old white leather benches and kinda grimy old computers. We had booked a regular room at a special discount rate due to booking 6 months in advance. We checked in (after the man at the desk finished one phone call on the landline and another one on his cell phone and finally acknowledged our presence) and had the pleasure of getting our bags up to the third floor (that's what most Americans would call the fourth floor). There is an elevator, but you have to go up two medium flights of stairs to get there, and then another one or two flights after the elevator lets you off. Once we finally got to the room, we had an unpleasant surprise. The regular rooms are on par with a dirty hostel, and if that's what you want, there are cheaper ones and better ones near the Termini. Imagine old bed, dirty floor, bathroom so old that it can no longer look clean. Also, the bathtub had sides that are 3 ft high. I wanted to cry. Room 306 to be exact. I do have to say that the sheet did not look dirty. I went downstairs where the guy suddenly had trouble understanding English. I told him the room looked nothing like on the Internet and was dirty. After a long discussion he said the only thing we could do was upgrade by paying 20 euros a night for a superior room. I tried to bargain down with no success. Since we were way too tired to switch hotels, my husband looked at the superior rooms. They were definitely a step up from the regular rooms. However, still nothing to rave about. Room 208 had a double bed but the bathroom reeked so badly of mildew that it nearly knocked my husband over. We ended up picking room 201. Clean room with two twin beds pushed together. A clothes bar above the desk, a tiny bathroom. The floors were gray painted concrete with paint that would peel off in large chunks on your feet/socks/shoes. See photos. The bed was uncomfortable. The bathroom door was difficult to open and the towel hook was on the other side of the door from the shower. The shower had only a half glass door so the floor got drenched with every shower. The people at the front desk were clueless and unable to help most of the time. We asked where the buses left for Tivoli and they couldn't help. The computers kept on losing the Internet every 5 minutes and they blamed the Wifi when we could clearly see the strong Wifi signal. We asked for our room not to be cleaned (since we spent 10 mins on the first day wiping surfaces down with antiseptic wipes) and they couldn't even follow that simple request. Pluses of this hotel: Very close to the Trevi fountain. This was the main reason that we booked it. In hindsight, we used public transportation so much and things are so spread out in Rome that being so close to the fountain really didn't matter. In future trips we plan to stay near the Termini, which is a very easy place to get to on the buses. The Metro is generally good and fast but does not go to many areas of the city. One other surprising plus was a nice breakfast with coffee, water, juice, and tea as well as an assortment of pastries and jams/nutella/butter. All in all, we felt cheated as we were forced to pay an extra 60 euros for our 3 night stay. It actually was still a price that was near our goal 100 euro per night, but had we known we would have found a different hotel. Incidentally, we know we are not the only ones who felt bait-and-switched. While we were in the lounge trying to get the computer to work, a young couple came in with the same complaints as us - that their room was dirty and did not look like the picture on the website. The person at the desk told them that those pictures were of the superior rooms, and that there were no more rooms available to upgrade that night. I believe they ended up switching to a sister hotel of this one, owned by the same people - possibly the Accademia or the Tritone, or maybe one night at each. I don't know if they ended up paying a lot more for that, but I wouldn't be surprised.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, NJ", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay at this hotel.It doesn't rate 1 star...not cheap\u201d", "Author": "mapjoe", "ReviewID": "UR65195284", "Content": "The hotel is 1/2 finished ..barebones minumum.

Location excellent, close to everything. Security in hotel seemed ok. Room small but space enough with old fashioned unappealing tired decor in bedroom and antiquated bathroom. The shower functioned ok. Reasonably quiet and clean with window shutters that screen out the light & an opening window - not much of a view however. Mattress and pillows old, hard & lumpy, very uncomfortable & urgently needing replacing. So bad I would have bought a pillow if I could have located one nearby! Breakfast was awful, no healthy options - fake orange juice, limp croissant, jam tart and cake, the same everyday. Front desk staff cordial except for one whose abruptness came across as rudeness (unintended I believe but a bit off putting)... The hotel is suitable for the budget conscious travellor seeking a great location who can overlook the negatives. Rome is expensive, but I would suggest that this hotel is not worth more than 90 euros max for a double/twin room. Do not buy from the fruit stall at Trevi fountain, very, very expensive.

On via del Tritone take bus 62, 63 or 492, get off in Largo Argentina and take tram 8, then after crossing the bridge, get off at a big white building from a Ministry. You can not miss it. You will enjoy the (short) ride in the bus and tram to see the city. Avoid eating or drinking at the restaurants around the St. Peter's basilica, very expensive and very bad quality, not even fresh food. Rome is a wonderful city, full of history, culture and art.

Ok - Where do I start. The reception staff are horrible. Absolutely the most unfriendly people ever - rude, unhelpful, arrogant --- DO NOT STAY HERE ! The room was below average -- to get there (With our heavy suitcases) we had to go to the first floor to get the lift ! The bedroom was small but clean. The bathroom was about 100 years old and dirty. The shower (If I could call it that) was a disgrace - I had to crouch down as they installed a boiler right there under where the shower sits -- Crazy stuff. I meant to take photos to put them on her but I didn't get the chance as I was there for a wedding. On that point -- Most of the wedding party were staying next door in Hotel Cecil which appeared to ber very nice. I was best man and the groom staying next door tried to drop something up to my room but was refused -- they wanted to see a passport ! to drop something up to the room. DO NOT STAY HERE. Off the bathroom was a balcony which was boareded up so we had a tiny old battered window looking onto a dirty alley. The reception area looks great but don't be fooled. I have never stayed in hostels in Oz or anything like that so maybe I'm spoiled but let me assure you -- I wouldn't stay here ever again. This is the first review I have placed on this or any site and I registered with Trip advisor to warn people. I hope this has helped and hope that you won't book this hotel.

Once we figured out the map, and got used to the confusing streets, we found that this hotel is perfectly situated to explore Rome. The Spanish Steps are almost right around the corner! A very good map is available at the front desk, and the staff are wonderfully helpful. The room we had (#205) was a double with a wonderfully comfortable bed and air conditioning that worked. It overlooked Via Francesco Crispi, so there was intermittent noise at night. When we were there, the hotel was fully booked but very quiet \u2013 probably other hotel guests falling into their bed, exhausted as we did!!! Our room was very small, but it was immaculately clean. Bathroom was tiny too and shower was a bit of a challenge, but again clean and functional. Each room seems to have its own hot water tank, so we never ran out of hot water, except for the time that we shut the tank off by accident!!! Watch the switches on the bathroom wall! We had breakfast at the hotel everyday, which consisted of orange juice, coffee, tea, croissants, buns, and a couple of pastry items. It was the same every day, so a bit monotonous, but excellent coffee. If you want an espresso or cappuccino, you just have to ask Lucia, who is tending to the breakfast area. There are many stairs in this hotel, with a extremely small elevator that you have to take some stairs to get to. There is no safe deposit box in the room or available at the front desk, which was a bit of a worry, but we were fortunate to have no issues with our passports being stolen. It really feels like a small family-run hotel. A wonderful thing about Rome is that the water is delicious. We carried water bottles with us everywhere and refilled them from the public fountains. Save your money on water, and spend it on the excellent wine and beer (ha)! There\u2019s a small supermarket on the way to the Trevi Fountain, which was handy for snacks and the aforementioned wine. Ask at the front desk for directions to Despar. There are also many little restaurants, serving food that is familiar and delicious. My kids loved being able to eat pasta every day, but we sure enjoyed our potatoes when we got home! We liked the look of the sidewalk tables, but always chose a table inside in the air conditioning. On our last night, we dined at one of the many restaurants near the Piazza de Barberini. It\u2019s an easy walk to the Metro, which takes you one way to the Vatican or the other way to the Bus/Train Terminal. We booked a tour of the Vatican Museums with Viator. I would highly recommend this tour. There\u2019s so much to see that we would have been overwhelmed and then not fully appreciated what we did see. Our tour guide was excellent, and you are given headphones, so you don\u2019t have to be right beside her to hear her commentary. We booked a \u201chop on, hop off\u201d bus tour one day, which took us to the Colosseum and onward. The Coliseum was interesting, but I feel that we would have got more out of it if we would have booked either a tour or rented an audio guide. Same with the Roman Forum; we walked around, but really didn\u2019t understand what we were seeing, and there isn\u2019t a lot of information to be had on site. A good tip is to walk to the entrance of the Palatine Hill to buy your ticket for the Colosseum. The line is shorter here, so you spend less time standing waiting for your adventure to begin. We took the fast train to Napoli and then the local train to Pompeii. It was very interesting, but again not a lot of information on site, so we were glad to have done some research ahead of time. Pompeii is a large area, so you can expect to do a lot of walking and it\u2019s a full day excursion. All the Roman people we encountered were so friendly and helpful, but be prepared to spend time standing on a street corner trying to figure out where you are on the map, and where you need to go. This was our first trip to Europe, so we were enthralled by the narrow streets, old buildings, business people on scooters and beautiful piazzas.", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location\u201d", "Author": "aviatorlady", "ReviewID": "UR16951288", "Content": "Best price thru Venere.

The shower filled up fast if you weren't careful, and the hot water ran out quickly. We discovered that with 4 people, each had to only turn on the water in short bursts so as not to over-run the pan or use up the hot water. If you can live with that, the rest was fine.
