You have so many things to visit and do in Istanbul that staying in your hotel room is almost a sin.

The hotel is situated in the touristic area, at about 8-10 minutes from the Blue Mosque and Santa Sofia. You can go walking from there to the place where you can take the ferries to the Asian side of the city. There are lots of restaurants in the area (most of them for tourists), but some are good enough to have a nice dinner, and you can also find bars to have a beer or two if you want.

A tramline which runs along the centre of town is clean, inexpensive with automated ticketing and very frequent. You can't get lost as the tram just runs in a straight route and teminates near one of the palaces. Watch out when crossing the main road though as it is deceptively quiet until a speeding trams turns the corner - keep to the pedestrian crossing.

The ferries are again very warm, clean with both 'turkish' and european style toilets.

Many buildings are being renovated and the Central and Spice Market (by the ferry dock) are a must see, even though much of what they sell can easily be found down Camden Market! This is a great hotel for a first time visit to Istanbul with rooms facing the icy blue of the Bhosporus. The road is noisy when the double-glazed windows are opened but this is due to the road surface rather than traffic, and the sunrise and sunsets over the Bhosporus are truly beautiful.

It was a great hospitality and the best view one can imagine. Initially we booked for a standard room but when I saw the suite they offered I had to takeit because it was very nice and comfy and we were three. Myself, Mom, and my future Sister in Law had a great time staying for full 10 days in this georgeous hotel and its location. Close to everything and the receptionists were incredibly fast in meeting every inquiry we had. Thanks so much to Mesut and Turker and I hope to come back again to your lovely hotel. I recommend this hotel to everyone, be it single, couple or family. It is a place to be if you are visiting Istanbul.

Beware though that the hotel is located by a busy road and there are no public transport options near the hotel. Sultanahmet is a 10 minute walk through steep and cobbled streets and another 5 minutes and you will be in the Grand Bazaar. This is also where you will catch the tram to get to the Asian side.

Location is perfect for sight seeing, decor is nice, and the hotel is well kept. Note that the rooms are quite small, and that the beds are rather short (and narrow). The hotel restaurant and breakfast buffet are nice, but there is no room service. The staff were universally friendly, but not always efficient. Our suite was cleaned every day during breakfast, while the ground floor room never was cleaned before 4 PM, and even then only after complaining. Similiarly, coffee set was missing from one of the rooms at check in, and was only delivered after numerous complaints over two days. Replenishment of the coffee also required multiple reminders, even when the cups had been cleaned and the minibar restocked. I feel somewhat bad writing this since the employees were so nice and some of them were obviously hard-working. Maybe they are understaffed?

It is within moderate walking distance of the Blue Mosque and the palace. Another couple who had cruised with us also stayed there. The small hotel was spotlessly clean, and the staff was extraordinarily helpful. We arrived hours before check-in time, and although they could not make a room available early, they stored our luggage and treated us to a drink and snack at the cafe. They helped us find the sights and shopping we needed , and arranged for honest, inexpensive cab rides to the Spice Bazaar, a recommended restaurant, and the airport. There are several restaurants and shops within an easy walk. We chose to eat in the hotel restaurant and found the service attentive and the food excellent. I have difficulty walking, and they had no elevator, so they upgraded us to a first floor suite with a balcony at no extra charge, and without us asking for it. Their cafe and restaurant overlooked the Sea of Marmara. During one of the days we stayed there, there was a wedding reception, but there was no bothersome noise associated with it. They have a computer with high speed internet and a printer in a niche off the lobby available for use of the guests, and I used it several times without waiting.
