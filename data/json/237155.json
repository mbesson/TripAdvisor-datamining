All staff were very friendly. Value - excellent. We booked on booking.com and got a great deal. Sleep Quality - good. Comfortable beds. Noise is a particular problem for light sleepers as other guests may come in quite late from 4-5am. Cleanliness - rooms and bathroom were clean but the bedsheets had clearly not been changed. When we arrived, we found hair strands all over the pillow covers and bedsheets but no stains. As it was late when we arrived, we had to just pick the hair off and deal with it. By the next morning, we weren't fussed anymore. Location - excellent. A couple of minutes walk to La Rambla. Felt safe walking back to the hotel late at night. Rooms - large, basic rooms that were bright and well designed, there was a window in the bedroom and bathroom (we stayed in a triple/quadruple room). No TV but expected for a 1 star. Free fast wi-fi. Travel tips - La Seu Cathedral in the Gothic Quarter (or known as the 'Gothic Cathedral') is a must see. Nearest metro station is Liceu and is a couple of minutes walk from the hotel - you can take the train to La Sagrada Familia (tickets should be purchased the day before to avoid the very long lines - this also applies to any other structures by Gaudi) and Park Guell. Port Vell and the beach is within walking distance of the hotel. Overall impressions - nice, comfortable stay. Great option for budget travelers.

Valued the pro and con, the price was a big attraction, and the location, and the cleanness... I almost developed claustrophobia when I found out my room 203 without a window, I tried not to look at the four walls directly otherwise I could have passed out. I went to a tour the next day and met a lady on the trip who said her room was so simple and small with a single bed but cost 2.5 times of mine, I immediate thought the air in my room was so fresh! The room was simple but clean and nicely layout, a conformable double bed with two pillows, but I was a little disappointed to find out there wasn\u2019t a bed sheet, I had to sleep on a light blue blanket, it looked clean but no sure how often it gets washed. Reading the reviews here, someone suggest taking ear plugs when staying at hotel Call, how bad it could be I thought, but I wished I listened! It was very bad. I couldn\u2019t hear noise from the street (probably because I didn\u2019t have a window) but every time somebody talked in the hall way or in their room, it was like they were talking directly to me. My room next to the lift, so I was constantly woken up during the night, 1am, 2am, 3am... each time someone came back or went out or moved about, banging, chatting, singing.... !! I had very little sleep during three nights of staying! Hotel Call has a great location, it is near La Rambla \u2013 the street you must visit and it is only a few minutes away from the Boqueria market. The night life in Barcelona is so calm and relaxing, walking alone the La Rambla, the shops, bar, restaurant all open until late but you don\u2019t see any drunk people shouting or smashed bottle on the street, people enjoy their lives with style and class. I felt it was quite safe at night because so many tourists walking around on the streets, even 11pm I walked back to the hotel by my own I wasn\u2019t too afraid, but you still need to take a precaution of your own safety when walk alone at night. The cleaning lady saw me leaving the room with my luggage, she opened the lift door for me with a big smile on my face, her smile was so sincere that made me wanting to hug her. Barcelona is such a nice and friendly city, I can\u2019t wait to go back visiting it next time and I will come back to hotel call as the great value it offers and of course will bring a pair of ear plugs with me! If you visit Barcelona don\u2019t forget they use different size of plug to UK, (two pin), buy an adaptor at a poundland shop here cheaper than buying it at airport. Visit Montserrat is a great day/half day out, Stunning view! Finally to everyone, yes, we are on holiday, we are having a good time, but after midnight, can you please have a little consideration of the following guesses and keep your voice/noise down?", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCheap & Cheerful\u201d", "Author": "Vix8323", "ReviewID": "UR117899831", "Content": "Stayed for 6 nights & was a great location near to La Ramblas & easy access to the underground.

Past 1am, there was a constant loud knocking at our door. When I checked out, there was a man, more of a goon, speaking spanish which I couldn't understand. For fear that some bad element entered the hotel, i immediately slummed the door and locked it. A few more minutes and the goon was still there. Knocking heavily at our door. so I called the reception and asked for help. That arrogant, old receptionist guy demanded that we pay immediately or else the guy wouldn't leave the door and we won;t be able to get our taxi to the airport. WTF!!!!! So my friend and I had no choice but to get down, on our PJs and pay the reception our dues. But up until now, I consider it a nightmare. Imagine demanding you to pay at the wee hours of the morning?! They don't trust their customers. And the way they deal with us is outright unprofessional.

In brief: the PROS are: location in the Barri - low price - friendly and polite reception (basic command of English proved just enough to avoid any misunderstandings) - air conditioning in rooms (though they sometimes turn it off for periods of anywhere from a quarter of an hour to an hour). The CONS are: thin walls - low average age of guests, who sometimes treat this place as a hostel and have to be reminded it is in fact a hotel - loud room service (late risers - DON'T take rooms 405, 406, 407, 408 - they are located next to the maintenance space). - lack of windows in rooms (yes, though in noisy Barcelona this just as well might be a blessing).

Size of room was not really an issue - with city centre hotel at that price you expect compact and it was bigger than we expected - ensuite and room were big enough for two people to move around and get ready etc with no problem. it wasnt like we spent hours in the room other than sleeping so not a problem. the safe we didnt use because of the warning on here but it looked like the standard model used in all the hotels where i've never had a problem the staff worried me - even though we always treat staff well and dont expect the usual problems, we are a gay couple and the reports on the old guy here and others worried me - but they were all fabulous. They treated us with respect and smiles (the latter normally missing in spain :-)). the so called rude old guy chatted and joked with us a couple of times as well and so did the middle aged guy so i really cant see why other people have had problems - of course we did the usual things anyone would do lik elearning to say hello goodbye please and thank you in catalan rather than using english or spanish and i think that helped. in terms of cleanliness i cant see what the fuss was about - very clean with bedding and towels totally changed every day we were there. sure some of the fixtures and fittings were a bit dated but no prob we didnt have trouble with noise other than one morning when 2 of the cleaners woke us up (1030am so not too early) with a loud conversation and the electrical sockets are a problem in their number and location - one at ceiling height for a non existent tv and one in the bathroom - we had to improvise a shelf for our travel kettle but that was no prob - next time i go i'll take an extension lead Overall i would recommend this to other travellers and indeed already have.

I printed out a map of the hotel's location and arranged our journey from Estacio du Nord (The bus station near Arc de Triomf metro.) by metro (Taxi is reasonable if you can find one that is free) We travelled to Jaume metro. Found the street leading to the Plaka Jaume and the very narrow street to the hotel very easily. (about 2030 at night) I think every spare blank wall in Barcelona has grafitti on it. Which is very sad. Major towns in England are the same. LIke most of the previous reviews my comments would match, rooms clean, beds, changed every day, clean towels, HOT water all the time. Toilet clean. The three men that manned the desk, were always helpful. I speak a little spanish so that went a long way. BUT even if you dont , shouldnt be a problem. Our room was on the third floor near the lift, which we rareley heard. Our small window faced a wall. NOt a problem as it made the room very peaceful and you wouldnt know you were in a very vibrant bustling city. Like a previous reviewer didnt know what the weather was like until we ventured out. I feel sorry for the 2004 person who had there safe robbed, but we had no problems. Its a coded safe, and you just have to remember your code. Warned about pickpockets etc, but you use your noddle, take a bun bag or a zipped bag., and place it in front of you. THe downsides we experienced were, there are NO plug points in the room ( we took a kettle and couldnt use it.) MIssed my early morning cuppa. I couldnt charge up my mobile phone either. The other ,was a fellow English guest waking the whole of the hotel cos he couldnt get into his room. Everyone I think in Barcelona knew his wifes name by the time he finished. Unfortunate for us on our 1st night. He left the same morning . I hasten to add the following 4 nights were peaceful. THe hotel is a few minutes walk from the Ramblas and Liceu Metro. where there are Lots of eating places all competing for customers, cheap and otherwise. So you pays your money and takes your choice. Every morning the streets surrounding the hotel are washed and hosed down. Rubbish is removed every night or early morning. Lots of major tourist sites of easy walking distance from the hotel. Small cafe round the corner for a nice cup of \"Cafe con Leche\" ot Te con Leche and snacks for breakfast. Metro multi ticket very cheap and covers a large area. Watch the days and times of opening of the sites you want to see. If you have booked a short stay you may miss an attraction you want to see because its not open the days you have booked. IE the Magic fountain at Mont Juic which is only on Thurs, FRi Sat and Sun. I would stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "October 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guimar\u00e3es", "Title": "\u201cSuitable to stay for a visit to Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "carlaGuimar_es", "ReviewID": "UR8606747", "Content": "We were two couples with one children each.

It has a good location (near La Rambla, the Cathedral and the Liceu metro station). In La Rambla there are many cheap places to eat, like McDonald's, KFC, Pans, etc. To conclude, it's suitable for someone who is visiting Barcelona city.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houthalen", "Title": "\u201cpleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "wickedcheck", "ReviewID": "UR7682062", "Content": "We went there for two nights, and had no problems at all, the staff was very friendly (even the one at night, he called a taxi at 5 in the morning for us).
