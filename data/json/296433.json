I was greeted with a single but large room with 2 beds and I had a really good night rest. In the morning, you will be humbled with the sumptuous and what I can describe as a mega breakfast - pardon me! I was also delighted to discover that the hotel is located in a busy textile/fashion centre in Istanbul when I took a long stroll around the area walking up the street to the games park on the street to the road behind visiting some shops and back to the hotel. I love to commend the staff and management for an excellent service and to thank the airline for making my trip a worthwhile one with a transit to experience the hospitality in Istanbul. Well done and all the best!", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cyprus", "Title": "\u201cGood quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "tamer1", "ReviewID": "UR124125978", "Content": "A friend of the family actually recommended me to stay at this hotel and was not disappointed one little bit.The room was spacious,clean,the staff was friendly,the breakfast was fantastic,and the location of this hotel was great..Good in every way.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "redsea", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location to merter market\u201d", "Author": "kikokarim", "ReviewID": "UR119843211", "Content": "wonderful staff very clean and good size room ....i stayed twice in this hotel and soon will be back to istanbul and sure in gunes (the sun) hotel : )", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cConvinient transit hotel\u201d", "Author": "lucanac", "ReviewID": "UR118338519", "Content": "Stayed several night at Gunes Hotel as I was working at the Expo centre (close to the airport) and wanted to be a bit closer to the city. The hotel itself is situated in a residential neighborhood, 10min on foot to metro (Metro) and 15min to Zeytinburnu (Tram). The tram goes straight through downtown (Blue Mosque, Bazar and all the way to Kabatas). So it is perfect for being between the airport and the city on a short layover. The buffet is excellent, probably one of the best I've had for a 4star hotel. There are numerous local clothes shops en route to Zeytinburnu, nice shirts, pants etc for less than $5USD. Downside, since the hotel is in a residential area it is hard to find food after hours.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ayr, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood choice\u201d", "Author": "kanadai", "ReviewID": "UR109063915", "Content": "Three of us stayed at the Gunes Hotel in early May.

Although the hotel is not in a touristy area, the streets were still lively with lots of restaurants and shops to choose from.

First, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-proclaimed 4-star rating is completely misleading. Be advised that hotels with a 4 star rating in Turkey are in no way the equivalent of 4-star hotels in either the U.S. or Europe. Turkey has something dubbed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153superior 4-star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which may be close to the standards of the rest of the world, but their ordinary 4-star is closer to a pretty sketchy 3-star hotel elsewhere. So, by all mean, lower expectations if you intend to stay at the Gunes. The rooms are dated and in need of refurbishment. Within a minute of arrival, we tried to open the window in the room and the hinge promptly broke. The next morning when taking our showers, we were greeted with alternately hot and cold water which barely dripped out of the shower head. This was not unique to our room, because others in our group complained of the same thing. Then, I pulled on the ancient air dryer to start it only to pull it out of its socket. The good news is that the Gunes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 staff is courteous and attentive and promptly fixed both the window and the hair dryer (although the hair dryer never actually blew hot air). Also, be ware of the location of the hotel. If you are looking for an airport hotel (Ata Turk), then you are fine. If you are interested in exploring Istanbul, it takes around 30-40 minutes in typical Istanbul traffic to get into the heart of the city from the hotel. The upside to the hotel is its very lavish breakfast that is included in the price of the room. All in all, though, for the prices they charge, you can get a much better deal in the heart of town.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel\u201d", "Author": "WillwillW", "ReviewID": "UR54755323", "Content": "good hotel nice bar but very bad wifi network !!", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "south east Europe", "Title": "\u201cSAFE HARBOR WITH NO FRILLS.\u201d", "Author": "StudioChinn", "ReviewID": "UR53131385", "Content": "This is a basic, clean and reliable hotel with attentive staff.

To be fair, the hotel is in fairly good shape with fairly spacious rooms, clean, a good choice of channels on the TV, free wireless Internet and very good breakfast buffet. The rooms themselves are starting to show signs of wear and tear. A minor renovation will be in order soon. My biggest complaint was location. We normally like to get a hotel right in the thick of things so that we can stumble home at any hour of the day we wish. The Gunes is a ten minute walk to the Zeytinburnu stop where you can pick up the T1 tram to the center. The tram ride to Sultanahmet is 25 minutes which is where most of the good stuff is located. It is another 10 minutes or so to the other end, Kabatas, where it is about another 10 minute walk to the Palace.
