Great location, generally quiet, very clean and comfortable. Well-trained staff as you would expect at a Marriott property. Just a couple of suggestions: replace the old residential-model toilets with commercial pressure models that don't require frequent maintenance, and upgrade the breakfast. I realize people can stock the kitchen with their own breakfast makings, but not everyone wants to do that. The choices in the lobby are mostly sugary cereals, frozen waffles, pastries and hard-boiled eggs. Even Fairfield Inn can beat that. Also, as a previous reviewer noted, there are no king beds.

This location is a little tricky to locate, and parking can be a bit of a walk (or lug depending on suitcases). Black Friday must have been 'bring your child to work day' as many staff seemed to have their children with them. Still, the children were not in any way in the way, just odd to see children following parents working at the hotel. Breakfast is almost not worth the bother-eating in a lobby with 9 total chairs and 3 tables is silly (like I wrote 'lean operation'). Cold stuff-cereal and a few toasted things. Front desk clerk also restocks breakfast foods-and if anyone is checking out they have to attend to 2 things at one. Still-for the $$ was fine. Hard to give a low rating but do not confuse with anything close to luxury. This is a place to sleep and be on your way. Aslo, is a place that seems to draw many dog owners and their pooches.

There was a nice assortment of cereals, muffins, bagels, juices, coffee, etc. in the lobby for breakfast the next morning. This was very handy. Again, at check out, the front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful when we asked for directions to the Speedway. We would certainly recommend the hotel and we would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Celina, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWe were very pleased with the comfortable beds and resonable prices.\u201d", "Author": "csh5113", "ReviewID": "UR85217516", "Content": "I traveled to Indy with a group of 8 women, we were in town for a show and shopping and were pleasantly surprised with the wonderful location next to wonderful shopping and great resturants.
