The hotel has 6 floors of rooms - unless you are on the 6th floor at the back of the hotel you will not be able to sleep due to the sound of the nightclubs.

We were assigned to the Sun and Sands Hotel. I travel a great deal, and believe me this is no 4-star hotel. And don't let the hotel's name fool you - although Dubai is a beach destination, the only sand around this property is that to be found strewn about the big construction site across the street! There were burn holes in the sheets and bedspread in my room, and the bathroom fixtures were old and corroded. The water never got even warm, let alone hot, no matter how long I let it run in the shower. Furthermore, my colleague reported that when he took a shower, he was struck hard in the back of his head because the entire shower head flew off! When he was checking out, a staff member actually came up and grabbed him by his shirt, showed him the shower head (which he had left in his room), and accused him of destroying it! Some of the restaurants in the hotel were closed and the ones that were open looked very unappealing and empty. There did not appear to be many other dining options in the neighborhood, which is hard to navigate due to current road construction. We ended up going to lunch at the nearby Mayfair Hotel, which has an excellent buffet and very helpful staff. I can also recommend the Al Safadi restaurant, which has excellent Lebanese food - it's about a 5-10 minute walk through a veritable obstacle course of traffic barriers (ask staff for directions). If you manage to get there without being run over, the food is quite good and reasonably priced. The pounding noise from the disco (or discos) at the Sun and Sands made sleep difficult to impossible (we were on the first floor), and the staff couldn't have cared less when we complained. The promised \u201cbroadband\u201d Internet was also non-existent--after spending nearly $20 for an Internet access card and then waiting in the business center for nearly 10 minutes to get even one web page to load only partially, I gave up in frustration. Again, the staff did not care. To top it all off, on the way out of town, my colleague nearly missed his flight because the hotel shuttle back to the airport made a long detour without prior warning to drop some other guests off at the beach. As noted by the previous reviewer, this hotel seems to cater to a clientele from Iran and various Arab countries - I also saw numerous Russians. By their standards, this might qualify as 4-star, but my colleague and I found the place very disappointing in quality and not at all worth the price of slightly more than $200 per night that we paid (and this was a discount over their outrageous posted rack rates of $327 per night!).", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Faversham, Kent", "Title": "\u201cSun and Sands - Won't be visting again\u201d", "Author": "MarkyB0902", "ReviewID": "UR10476300", "Content": "Spent 7 nights at the Sun and Sands Hotel in October 2007 Situated in Deira, the old part of Dubai, this is a bit off the beaten track if you want to be nearer the newer parts such as Bur Dubai and Jumeirah thus we spent most of our time getting in and out of taxi's (which were not always easy to get because of the hotels location). The reception staff were inattentive and seemed generally disinterested in us. This may have been a cultural issue as we may have been the only Europeans staying there. The other guests were either Arabic or Iranian. Well decorated throughout all the rooms had a good sense of elegance except for the Churchill Bar just off the reception which looked like a tacky games room with two pool tables and electronic games. Not bad food there though. Bedrooms were a reasonable size. Two double beds, table and two small armchairs. Very clean throughout, especially the bathroom which again was a good size with various complementary toiletries. No tea and coffee making facilities which was a disappointment but not the end of the world as there was an excellent room service menu from which you could get a pot of coffee for about \u00a31 - not bad I thought! Limited TV channels if you want to watch it, and those that were in English had a very poor reception. Did not bother us as Dubai has more to offer that than sitting in your hotel room. No real entertainment in the hotel. They boast two nightclubs on the same floor, one Russian the other Arabian. Neither gave us a warm welcome so did not stay. Not sure what the restaurants were like as did not go but they looked nice when we looked in. Breakfast came as part of the deal but did not get down once to try it, as out until all hours enjoying all that Dubai has to offer. Overall this is an average hotel with not the best staff I have ever encountered which, in our opinion, is also not in the best location to maximise your stay in Dubai..", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sun & Sands Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d671967-Reviews-Sun_Sands_Hotel-Dubai.html", "Price": "$86 - $859*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">PO Box 35659</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "671967", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/30/94/30945636f48bd57e68028dd556c996d21large.jpg"}}
