It has recently changed management and they are working hard to improve the image. Previous reviews were not very flattering. Work is still ongoing, but the reception area was modern, staff welcoming; and the warm chocolate chip cookie went down well with a cup of tea! Our room was, as stated above, comfy and clean, all the facilities worked well. We did not eat in the hotel, as there are many food outlets in the area. The proximity of Victoria main line station, Underground and buses make getting around very easy. Not the most salubrious area, being behind the station, but it was quiet at night.

Bathroom is very clean, very nice, very well-maintained...like new. But then the desk light didn't work and the overhead didn't work and the toilet didn't flush properly. I called for service and within 3-4 minutes, a hotel service manager came up to assess the situation, repairing one light on the spot and she called for the handyman.

We booked through an agent who recommended the hotel for convenience, and it is certainly central. It is very close to the Victoria bus station, the Victoria train station and underground but still 5 mins walk from the Gatwick Express and further from the coach station. Great for walking around London, close to pubs and eateries and there is a nearby launderette - ask the concierge. Staff were very helpful, professional and friendly. The breakfast wait staff in particular were excellent, anticipating our needs.Some food items are available on request eg: porridge. We did not have other meals in the hotel so cannot comment, but other guests mentioned that they were above average. The bar certainly looked good. Unfortunately we found the air con too hot, maintaining a temperature above 25 degrees even at night and unable to be adjusted, ruining the sleep quality. We reported this three times in our stay to no effect. As the windows had restrictors on them, we could not get adequate ventilation. Nor could we get a sheet - only a duvet was provided. Eventually we begged a duvet cover from housekeeping, but this disappeared after a couple of days and we had to go through the process of finding a replacement over again, ironically a problem caused by the very efficient housekeeping staff. There is a free internet connection on the mezzanine floor - ask the concierge for help. We found this most useful. Apart from the air con, this was a good stay. If this issue is sorted, then you should find the hotel worth the stay.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "samanthani", "ReviewID": "UR126014424", "Content": "I stayed at the DoubleTree by Hilton last month. We were there the week that the hotel officially changed from the Hesperia to to the DoubleTree Hilton Victoria, and I was a little concerned, especially given the reviews from around that time (building site/dust/disorganisation etc). I need not have been worried. I arrived at the hotel at about 11:30am, which is before the official check in time. However, when I enquired, my room was ready, and I was able to check in. The check in process was a little slow, but not excessively so. My room was on Floor 1, at the rear of the hotel. It overlooked some kind of staff walkway/smoking area of an adjacent building, so not the most pleasant view, but the room itself was fine. It was not a huge room, but definitely not tiny. The bathroom was adequate, with a good selection of toiletries. As one reviewer said, there was only one toothbrush (but who goes away without a toothbrush?!), one hot chocolate and only one biscuit - and I hadn't been offered a cookie on arrival :-( There also wasn't enough tea for my mum and I - so we just asked for another biscuit and some more tea. We also needed more towels (I use a lot of towels), and these were quickly provided. We didn't take our evening meals in the hotel, preferring to sample nearby restaurants instead. However, our package included breakfast, and I have to say, I'm surprised that some people have grumbled about the breakfast. On arrival, staff showed us to a table, and then brought tea/coffee and orange juice. My mum thought the tea was a bit cold, but it was fine for me. There was an excellent range of food available for breakfast (which is buffet style): cooked breakfast, cold meats and cheese, fruit and yogurt, selection of breads (with toast available to order), pastries, cereals. The main feature about this hotel though is its location. Although we were adjacent to Victoria Station (so, yes, there might be some noise - it is central London), we didn't use the train or tube, as we chose to walk to the nearby attractions of Buckingham Palace, London Eye, Houses of Parliament, Tate Britain, Westminster Cathedral and Abbey, and even Leicester Square. My mum was worn out by our last morning, so we took a 5 minute bus ride to Harrods, then walked back via Hyde Park. The hotel really is very well located. Although there was a little bit of disorganisation in the hotel due to the change to Hilton, there was minimal disruption to our stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful, and I would definitely recommend staying here (for the right price).", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birminghma", "Title": "\u201cReasonable Hotel for Central London\u201d", "Author": "AndyJBrum", "ReviewID": "UR125844591", "Content": "Booked this through Top Secret Hotels on Last Minute.

As the tenancy of the Hesperia would down, so did the standards. This Doubletree has improved the reception and bar decor, but everything else is much the same. Check in was slow, with little customer service, no cheerful greeting, just a cookie voucher thrust towards me. There was no check that I had stayed before of knew my way around. Out of the lift, the heavy, featureless corridors of old greeted me. The rooms too have not yet been updated or upgraded. The TV is limited with no menu or listing of the channels available. The air con made a noise but didn't seem to have any effect. I couldn't get any life out of the bedside radio alarm clock, well until the alarm went off - which I hadn't set!

Hotel location was ideal for catching buses, trains and underground. That alone was worth it. I asked for a king sized bed but got a queen instead. Room was functional but not a good value for the price, but certainly clean and serviceable. I had to ask for face cloths as they were not provided otherwise. Front desk staff were aloof and not very helpful. The dining room did not have much ambience if you wanted dinner--very dated. Morning breakfasts were great. Bartenders were great and more helpful than the front desk/concierge. What the hotel lacked in atmosphere was made up by its location--walking distance to several major attractions. We would recommend it for location alone but I think next time we will stay at the Rubens instead. Equally close to transportation but much more service oriented.

We didn't arrive until just about 10pm after flying into Gatwick and was very happy to find the hotel was literally across the road from the station so no expensive London taxi's on the first night. We arrived at the hotel to be greeted warmly and efficiently by reception we were then given two warm cookies to take upstairs with us, now i'm sure for most this is not such a big deal but for a pregnant and hungry woman at 10pm i was thinking i'd died and gone to heaven they were so scrummy!! You could see some hints that there was renovation ongoing with a few workmen moving around and some dust around new fittings but didn't feel this had any negative impact on our visit. We had an executive double room and it was lovely and clean and perfectly spacious for our needs. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Room was a bit noisy but you are in the centre of London so felt it was a slight trade off for location being so good. The following few days we were out and about sight seeing and found location really was topnotch. Underground station 2 minutes round the corner and Big Bus Company stop also about 5 minutes around the corner. We even walked to Buckingham palace which took about 15 minutes. We had tickets for the Apollo Victoria Theatre which we could see from our room so no trailing around on the underground at night either. We ate at the restaurant on the Saturday night and found the food delicious and excellent value for money if you do the 2 courses offer. Major down point was we happened to be there the night before a football match so when we went to the restaurant pre-theatre the bar area was pretty busy and as there isn't a dividing wall where we were sitting i got very irrate with the noise and the fact the staff weren't responding when some customers felt it appropriate to start kicking a ball about with their son in the bar which continued to roll into the restaurant on 4 occassions. Eventually one member of staff asked them to stop but as soon as he was gone it started again and three other members of staff appeared not to want to say anything. Not good enough for a restaurant aiming themselves in the higher budget bracket in my opinion. Not quite the romantic meal i had envisaged before heading out to the theatre. On checkout we were very thankful the hotel are willing to keep your bags for you as we weren't flying home until that night so meant we didn't have to trail them around on our last day of sightseeing which could have spoiled our last day. Overall a great experience and i would definately return but perhaps would check noise levels again before eating in the restaurant. Great base for sightseeing and the gatwick express to the airport.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lausanne, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cbad value\u201d", "Author": "Tom C", "ReviewID": "UR125242320", "Content": "1) could not find my reservation, had to wait 30 minutes until they gave me a room 2) It was 10\u00c2\u00b0C when I got in the room and it was impossible to warm this room 3) Ordering a meal for the room, they told me that they have a problem with the kitchen?!?? 4) the breakfast is miserable 5) the windows are so old that it seems they are open and you are in front of a heavy road and a train station...

For a start, in a double room, there was only one sachet of hot chocolate drink and one toothbrush provided. This meant that my partner and I had to share a toothbrush and share the chocolate drink in the morning. In addition, there was a large black burn mark on the sideboard, as if someone had placed an iron on it. This was strategically covered by the Welcome brochures and other literature - I am waiting to see if my card is charged for anything, as I left the room as it was found i.e. already damaged. The room itself was very small, with the double bed wedged into a space which left little room on either side. Side steps were required to get out from one side of the bed. Similarly, the bathroom was on the small side for a hotel that is supposed to be rated as 4 stars. Noise could be heard from the street below (my room was on the 4th floor). While my partner and I were not disturbed by this, it could be a problem for light sleepers. The check-in process was extremely long. Despite 4 staff standing at the front desk, 3 did not look up or acknowledge me and continued to look at their computer screens while I waited my turn for approximately 10 minutes for the only staff member who seemed to be dealing with live guests. This was followed by a further 10 minute wait at the empty concierge desk opposite the reception desk to leave our luggage; I was worried we would miss the show my partner and I were going to see. The staff I had contact with were very polite and professional. We only needed the room for the night and it served it's purpose i.e. it was somewhere to sleep, but I wouldn't pay full price for it as a stay in one of the standard double rooms is definitely not worth triple figures.

An added bonus for us was that some evenings we chose light and inexpensive dinners from the Marks and Spencers shops that were in the train station.

The room was about what we expected (actually fairly spacious for European standards), although we did find it to be unbearably hot the first night.
