We returned to Seattle again in November 2011 and once again stayed here. Unfortunately, there had been some changes in the hotel which left us feeling that we needed to update our review. First, when we were there in 2010, they offered a lovely free breakfast. When we went in 2011, we were informed that they no longer provide a free breakfast, though we could now buy breakfast. Second, the hotel has changed to the new trend which provides liquid soap in a container on the wall rather than providing a bar of soap and a small bottle of shampoo.

My brother lives nearby and I am from Boston, so I stay here on all my family visits. The hotel was a hidden gem, as other reviewers say. Small, cozy, clean, modern, organized, simple but tasteful, quiet, and a good location. It has changed. I just arrived last night, and noticed two main changes: 1) Instead of Aveda soap products, they now have Tommy Banana dispensers (feels more like a Sheraton or Hyatt or Hotel 8), and 2) the free breakfast area is now a pay-as-you-go cafe (which few use because of this). Lastly, they have not updated the furniture or carpets with the merger. So, what you get is a hotel that is starting to fray a little around the edges (it was about time for some cosmetic upgrades anyway) too. Also, because I used to stay so often, I could get the best room for a very reasonable rate. That seems to have changed now that they have been bought/merged. This is still a good hotel (average to slightly above average). It still has some of the feel and flavor of the old \"Watertown\". But it has changed. I would probably come back, out of convenience. But I would also look around more in the area and over in Wallingford and Freemont. I would look at B & B options, and other options in the same price range and comparison shop.

Nice touches include a lot of counterspace in the bathroom to lay out all your stuff, a wooden bench, larger sofa bed, mini-refrigerator and small microwave, and Keurig coffee machine with a selection of coffee and tea pods. Instead of those tiny bottles of shampoo and bar soap that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dissolve in water, this hotel has liquid dispensers (see photo) which I prefer. The toilet/tub room has a motion sensor that operates the fan, which is very quiet. The hair dryer afixed to the wall also has a built-in night light. The room comes with 2 terry-cloth bathrobes of the kind you find in hotels (thick and heavy so you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be tempted to stick one in your bag on the way out). The king bed was high quality with good quality linens and comforter. As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a free breakfast.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open until 2pm, after which the management puts out reasonable quality free coffee and mini-cupcakes in the lobby. The free parking is underground and the spaces are tight.

They used to have great Aveda products, but now they have soap/shampoo/conditioner that all smells like a cheap Pina Colada. Take my word on this, YOU HAVE TO BRING YOUR OWN SHAMPOO ETC. The stuff they have is really really bad. If you like a hot shower, you might be disappointed, sometimes the water is almost hot but some mornings just tepid. Not a chance that you could take a hot bath though with what comes out of the tap. Internet can be quite variable. Some days pretty fast, some days painful.

I booked the Watertown Hotel through a 3rd party site. The rate was a lot cheaper than going through Watertown directly. Most hotel chains price match or \"offer a lowest rate\" type of deal but I did not have the time to do research on this. I needed a hotel, read reviews and just paid. Time was not on my side. The hotel is very new. The decor is modern and clean. Nice king size bed, and a flat screen TV. Large mirrors and many power outlets. Our room was adjacent to the elevator and never at any moment did we hear hallway traffic or noise. The Watertown offers a breakfast buffet which includes all your basic pastries, yogurt and fruit. There are bagels, hard boiled eggs and different types of milk and juice. It is basic and does the job. WIFI is also free. It is unsecured but for checking basic email or news it does the job just fine. The hotel is adjacent to the AVE where there are many places to eat of different ethnic origin and at reasonable prices. Walking to and from the AVE is a few blocks so keep that in mind. If you don't want to walk you may want to consider another hotel. Right across the street is a convenient store that has a good selection of beer and snacks. Husky Stadium is dry so if you want to get your drink on stopping by this store right across the street is a good choice. There is a shuttle but we didn't take advantage of it. My GF and I ended up walking to the AVE and catching the bus to Seattle Center and Downtown. For those who are into bus riding and want to get to downtown just remember 71, 72, and 73. And when you want to come back to the U-District remember to go under Westlake Center and use Bay A. Some people have mentioned issues with the customer service, our contact with customer service desk employees was minimal but they did answer my questions and inquires. If you are going to a UW football game or dropping your college son/daughter to UW I would highly recommend this hotel. There is a walk to the campus but it isn't too bad. At the same time just be aware of your surroundings during the evenings. There are homeless that live on the AVE but if you keep your head on a swivel and are just aware of what is around you then you should have no problem. Also when booking, keep in mind the hotel room taxes. The price that I was quoted from the 3rd party site was over $50 bucks less then what I actually paid. The fine print is there but just keep in mind that the Seattle hotel room taxes when booking any hotel--not just this one.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cPlace was nice, but customer service was spotty\u201d", "Author": "biznesstrav", "ReviewID": "UR117923087", "Content": "My suite was nice and large.

The design and atmosphere is contemporary and relaxing. For first timers to Seattle this is a good alternative to more expensive places and there is ample public transit to get to where you want to go. The fact that it is in a working residential area is a little nicer than being downtown. I liked the fact that to get to any floor of the hotel you had to be in possession of a card key. Living in the neighborhood I can add that Roosevelt is a street that is busy most of the time with cars and foot traffic which is good as there are usually people around. Late at night apply the same street smarts you would in any unfamiliar city. Arguably the neighborhood is safer overall than downtown Seattle but it is possible to get into trouble if you aren't paying attention.

For example: 1) the secure, underground parking is free; 2) they provide loaner umbrellas at the front door which are needed in the Seattle area--my daughter's friend didn't bring an umbrella so the loaner came in handy; 3) they have a free computer in the lobby that we used to look up movie times at a nearby movie theater; 4) they have themed \"carts\" which are complimentary--we used a spa cart that contained a foot spa, handheld massager, CD player with relaxing music, lotions, shampoos, loofah, etc.; 5) the cookies in the lobby during check-in were delicious; 6) the free breakfast is very good for getting tourists through a morning of sightseeing in the area; 7) they provide a map on their card key holder which was very convenient for sightseeing; and 8) we did not use the free shuttle but that is also a nice touch. Regarding the previous comment about the hotel not being near anything, this hotel is a few blocks off busy 45th and a few blocks away from University Avenue. We were able to walk to the UW, several movie theaters and many restaurants. Our room faced Roosevelt Avenue and we were not bothered by street noise (I don't think it is a very busy street). I prefered the location to a hotel such as the Deca because it is a little bit out of the way. After dinner and a movie we walked back to the hotel around 10 p.m. and felt very safe along the way. I will be staying here on my next trip to Seattle and my daughter and I can't wait to return.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cFantastic find in Seattle.

Trudy and Ty were awesome, great people and great advice for the first time tourists. Thanks Trudy and Ty, you made our stay really hassle free and super easy. The great thing is that they have several places to drop you off and you can take an easy walk to most of the touristy stuff. (plus taxis from one end of downtown to the other is around 8 bucks). And you can just arrange for pick-up after you're done. 2. free breakfast, scrambled eggs and a protein (bacon, sausage); yogurt, cereals, granola, free tea and coffee 24/7, breads, muffins, etc. 3. Great value, definitely not as expensive as the downtown hotels 4. Rooms are huge. We stayed in a double queen room on the top floor with a great view of the seattle skyline. 5. and there's a nifty little market across the street for anything you might have forgotten, and i hear the deli sandwiches are good there too. 6. more for the business set (quiet) , but I think families would like this hotel a lot. Con's: 1. nothing really much in the vicinity, just a nice quiet urban neighborhood. 2. I didn't get the really friendly feel you get from the front desk. Some were nice, some just seemed busy and could care less. I did get a lot of help from a few of the girls who were really understanding whenever I changed the shuttle schedule around. And the guy who was so patient giving me driving directions over the phone, thanks! My tip: make sure you plan out you're trip...the concierge service is pretty \"do it yourself\" ^^ 3.

The Room 515 is spacious, modern and with great amenities. The bathroom features separate toilet/bath/shower, very large bathroom counter an sink, tremendously large mirror and pass through wardrobe. In room safe, fridge, coffee maker, iron, ironing board and microwave features complimentary coffee & tea and popcorn. The double queen beds were comfortable with nice linens and lots of pillows. There's also a desk and a \"a la carte\" service that's worth checking out. The facility offers complimentary indoor parking, complimentary breakfast that's a nice spread (though I wish the girls had the scrambled eggs and bacon out by 7am the other morning), a friendly staff and really nice interior spaces. Overall, I think this hotel is a winner. It's a bit removed from downtown but there is a complimentary shuttle service or you can spend $10-15 on taxi fare to whisk you into the DT area. Will be back in a few months for a trade show at the Convention Center and the Watertown is a top contender for me even with the travel considerations into downtown. The one issue I did encounter was with the in-room WiFi. They say to just lock into the hotel's wireless but neither of my computers could do so.

This is always kinda frustrating when trying to decide on a place to book, but when considering the Watertown, please take those ratings with a grain of salt. This is my second stay here, and it's a FANTASTIC hotel, in a great location. The property is in the university district, very close to UW (worth a visit), just close enough to downtown, and very convenient to the freeway. The staff is very nice, helpful, and assisted with dinner recommendations, etc. There aren't \"doormen\" falling all over themselves, but that's a good thing. The rooms are nice, very classily decorated, and most importantly, the beds are very comfortable. The rooms have an almost nautical feel. The lighting is not dim. I should note the parking area (structure, under hotel, FREE) is a bit tight, but very secure, with card only, fully gated-access. The complimentary breakfast is great, and the coffee is excellent. The breakfast area is surrounded by large windows and some bar seating that allows you to watch the UW students making their way to classes. Never had any issues with \"homeless\" people, and probably saw alot fewer than you would staying at a big-box downtown. Since my 2005 visit, an older stripmall across the street has been replaced by a very nice set of low-rise condos, with businesses below, including a small bodega which was very convenient. This is one of the cleanest hotels I've stayed at, and it's in a nice area IMHO. I think it all really depends on what you want out of a hotel. If you want all the phony \"service\" amenities (turn-down, doorman, etc.) then the Watertown may not be for you. If you want a classy, clean, nice, unique place to stay in a really cool part of town, near the prettiest PAC-10 school campus there is, then stay here.

We really enjoyed the Watertown Hotel! It is located north of downtown Seattle and I called the hotel ahead of time to ask about transportation from the airport. They arranged for us to be picked up by car service, and the driver was early and contacted me by cellphone. The car service far exceeded expectations -- we were picked up in a super clean, comfortable, Cadillac SUV with leather interior; the driver was very friendly and capable, and we did not have to wait (he waited for us!). At the hotel, we used the free shuttle service to go downtown on our second day. After that, we rented a car and took advantage of the hotel's free and secure parking garage. We appreciated the neighborhood and walked around a good bit, strolling through the Univ of Wash campus (about 1/4 mile away) and down to Portage Bay. We also shopped at Trader Joe's (2 blocks away) for some easy, fresh takeout to eat in the room. Our first room was average sized, but the vanity area was very large and the room had several nice features. There was a microwave and mini fridge and very nice and spacious custom cabinetry. The bath products are by Aveda, which is a nice touch. We found the bed and pillows to be quite comfortable and everything was very clean. At night, the street outside was quiet and we heard no other noises. During the day, the street was busier, but the noise was not a problem at all. We took advantage of the quick and easy free wireless internet using our iphone and our ipod touch. We also found the staff to be very helpful in recommending walks and places to eat. Our second room was a suite (don't know why they gave us that) and it was HUGE. It was L-shaped with a large spa tub under a window in one corner, and it had a couch, coffee table, and armchair as well as a desk. The vanity area was even bigger than in our first room, and it had the same pretty cabinetry and amenities. Unfortunately, and possibly because of the record heat in Seattle, our second room was not adequately cooled. The a/c worked but was too small for a huge 6th floor room. We tried the free breakfast a few times. It was typical free breakfast fare (cereal, oatmeal, toast, store-bought bagels, juice, milk, etc) with the addition of fresh scrambled eggs (which were fine) and bacon or sausage (which we didn't try). They also had lots of bananas and small cups of yogurt, too. It was nice to have fresh coffee and free breakfast.

However, I was stunned to arrive in the middle of the night and find that the manager had given our room away. We had ALREADY paid, and NO rooms were available. Their policy, so they said, was to put us up in the University Inn for the night -- definitely NOT what we wanted, nor what we paid for. The employee was completely useless in finding us an alternative hotel in Seattle. He said that everything was full, and that he was very sorry. The unwritten policy was to pay for our room at another hotel, but of course, he couldn't find one. I asked to speak with a manager. No manager available that Sunday morning. I asked for a computer, and found a room at the Redmond Marriott (decent) in 3 minutes. We stormed out, exhausted and frustrated. The next morning, of course, the manager did not call me. I wasn't called on Monday either. Attempts to reach the hotel by phone only reached their fax machine. I left on my honeymoon, and two weeks later, found a message from the manager on my phone sometime during my trip.

My husband, 4 yr old son and I stayed at Watertown over Memorial weekend. We were in a room with 2 queen beds on the 5th floor. The hotel is boutique-ish looking. It is on a quiet street - we never heard much traffic from outside or noise inside the room from neighbors. The staff was very nice & friendly. Free parking, breakfast, internet and laundry definitely is a plus. The room however, was the biggest let down. The carpet had several coffee stains. Housekeeping did not get to our room our first day - and for the following days, I called when we were leaving the room to make sure we got our room cleaned. Housekeeping didn't restock supplies very well - I often had to find them again to get more shampoo, glasses etc. One day I used a lint roller on the carpet because I was looking for a toy part lost on the carpet for my son ... I lint rolled maybe a couple of inches and my roller was COVERED in hair. Apparently the carpet hadn't been vacuumed in who knows how long. The front desk says they only vacuumed in between guests. I had only been there for one day - I would be bald if all that hair on the carpet was from me. Plus I never heard a vacuum cleaner going outside our room. And we spent a good amount of time in our room - naps for our toddler, etc. Other things about the room that I didn't like : the air conditioning unit in the room was loud. The room had an awkward layout. The (small) closet was RIGHT where the front door opened. The bathroom was large - but not much area to put things on, so couldn't really utilize the largeness of it. The water pressure was LOW LOW LOW. The front desk said that the city recently mandated this - so REAL BUMMER. I probably ended up using more water because it took so long to rinse soap off. So in summary - the hotel was just ok for me. I don't know if I would stay here again. I think it may be worthwhile to spend a little more money and stay somewhere else.

It's not really very close to downtown (maybe a 10 minute drive on the I-5) but it's situated in a really great part of the U District, 4 blocks away from University of Washington and a short walk away from University Ave where there are funky little stores and food places. Even though it's close to a large university campus, it's a very quiet hotel on a quiet street. Noise was never an issue. The rooms are incredibly soundproofed. We were on the 2nd floor above the street and heard nothing. Near the hotel (1 block away), there is a great little cafe called Portage Bay Cafe. If you're here on Sunday, make sure you go there for brunch. There are people lined up outside waiting for up to an hour and it's well worth it. Best brunch in Seattle apparently, and a great place for people watching. Highly recommended. The hotel provides a lot of things free of charge that other hotels would make you pay for.

On warm days, it is possible to go to tables outside, but Seattle is rarely warm early in the morning. Free, secure parking is an added bonus. You can simply park the car and take nearby bus transport Downtown or reserve a ride on the hotel's free shuttle (with a tip to the driver). The bus takes about 20 minutes to get downtown. It is an easy walk to the University of Washington and its museums and to shops, restaurants, movie theatres, etc., in the University area. I recommend the Cedars at 4759 Brooklyn Ave. for reasonably priced cuisine from India. The Burke Gilman Trail, for cyclists and pedestrians, stretches for miles about three blocks away from the hotel.

Reminded me of a favorite hotel in Venice Italy, with the Watertown's nod to Italian modern/funky/functional design. . . with reasonable rates (Seattle is expensive!) and accommodations that capitalize on comfort and a warm and welcoming staff. Perfect! I am very particular (as my husband well knows) about hotels. How delightful to find a beautiful and chic place that has truly comfortable beds, in spotless, 'hip' decor rooms that are quiet (I am a light sleeper), efficient and include secure parking and a better than average breakfast (not just cereal) in the rate. (Rare to find a Seattle hotel without an added daily parking rate!) And it gets better: you'll find a treasure trove of \"bests\" in Seattle to check out, courtesy of the information-rich Watertown Hotel Directory that is in each room, listing unique, local, \"staff favorites\" for everything from restaurants to Seattle sights (we asked for a copy to take with us... they graciously obliged); then there are the \"theme carts\" that are no extra charge, which you can order - spa cart, game cart, movie cart... too much fun! And the little fold up pocket map they give out, is just perfect for navigating your way around the main Seattle sights - Downtown Seattle is an easy commute from the Watertown; if you don't want to drive, check out their shuttle system. Points beyond Seattle sights are within reach as freeway access is close by (but not too close!). And spend some time off the beaten path of downtown to check out the U District, Wallingford, Ballard - and other nearby Seattle treasures. Even in the gray, drizzly days that Seattle frequently serves up, the comfortable accommodations and warm hospitality at the Watertown will definitely brighten your visit...

The reviewers were spot on in prepping me for the ups and downs of this hotel. I stayed near the Needle when in Seattle last year and had done some exploring then and had figured out the city somewhat, so was curious about staying in the U district and wasn't disappointed with that choice. I agree with another reviewer that it is important to know what you're doing if you're going to stay near the U vs. downtown or Queen Anne. But the hotel has a shuttle service with very accommodating and helpful drivers, it's easy to use and readily available, as is their car service which you can reserve for rides to and from the airport. I used their car service for a one day conference in Bellevue and was pleased with how that worked out. The hotel also can call cabs for you if it's not during shuttle hours, and they come right away and are helpful too. The front desk staff was pretty good, helpful and friendly. Every once in a while I asked a question that confused them, but there was someone else to ask and they did their best to make sure I had correct answers to my questions. Fitness room was adequate - heck, Seattle has so many outdoor fitness options, including bicycles and helmets to borrow at the hotel - so you don't have to settle for the fitness room as the only option. Breakfast was adequate as well, more than ample choices and it was decent and available over several hours which was nice. Breakfast and happy hour with wine and beer and little snacks on the weeknights were included with the room price. There are plenty of other hotels in Seattle in higher price ranges that don't offer nearly as much as this place does. The rooms are pretty nice, a little on the small side (at least the studio I had was a little small, but you're not in the room that much), but they seem European in feeling, with windows that open and very clean and well appointed, lots of nice pillows and modern fixtures and bathrobes and decent bath products. The A La Carte option is also fun, and a nice free feature. AAA discount offers decent rates. And on the last night, since housekeeping forgot to make up my room, the front desk made a special deal for me to make up for that disappointment, which was greatly appreciated. It is a wonderful selling point to have that kind of service which is more than willing to go out of their way when it's their oversight causing a guest disappointment.

Nothing like sleeping with fresh instead of bottled air. --great that they filter the tap water --if your room is near the ice and soda machines, don't worry -- they automatically turn off at 7 p.m. so no white noise! (products still available thru the night) --very friendly staff, who try to help --TWO bathrobes in the room!

I realize this is very unusual.

It's a \"Seattle-themed\" place -- how about offering a local paper instead of the most low-brow of national rags? --Cramped looking workout room means you're working out virtually on top of others -- just a bunch of equipment piled in there -- my workout room at home is more spacious! --The breakfast buffet, while ample, is not worth the time and effectively wastes an opportunity to have a great meal in a great foodie-lover's town (HORRIBLE coffee, juice not fresh and some more like Sunny Delight, scary looking pastries definitely not freshly baked or high quality, scrambled eggs looked like they were reconstituted powdered variety).

Overall, we were very impressed with the quality of the amenities of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff. The location, however, was fairly far from the downtown tourist hub. Reservation Process We were part of a group reservation for the beginning of our trip so I made my reservation directly through the hotel. The person taking our reservation was very helpful and courteous. When I asked what the rate would be to extend our stay past the room block, she quoted a reasonable rate. I told her that I was going to first check if there was anything around that rate downtown and get back to her. She strongly encouraged me to do so soon since they were filly up quickly. When I looked online, everything downtown was 1.5 to 2 times pricier than the Watertown, so we decided to stay here. The reservation agent also gave us the name of a town car service we could use for airport transfers. The service was cheaper than taking a taxi. Rooms The rooms were very modern and pretty spacious. The corner of the room had floor to ceiling windows. No special view but allowed for a lot of light. The bathroom had a separate vanity area from the shower/toilet area which made getting ready easy. I also liked that the TV was on a swivel and we could watch the tv from the bath while getting ready in the morning. We had 2 queen beds that were the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on before. I really liked that they color coded their pillows (white were hypoallergenic and cream were feather). The maid service was attentive enough to notice that I had a definite preference for hypoallergenic and made the bed up accordingly each day. The bath products were Aveda. I was disappointed that we were only given shampoo, bath bar and lotion- I was counting on conditioner which we did not get. I did not make use of the cart service (a unique amenity) but had a colleague who ordered the Spa Cart and loved it! I wish I had known about it before checking in and I would have reserved the Sweet Dreams cart (there are more carts available than just those listed on their web site). The rooms also had a mini-fridge (empty) and microwave so you could grab something lite from a nearby store for a snack. Breakfast was remarkably good for a free service although the juice glasses could have doubled as shot glasses (they were tiny). We took advantage of the the free happy hour one 2 nights and liked mingling with other guests. We did not make use of the bicycles but saw many that did. The rooms were very clean (although my carpet seemed to have a stain) and would pass a white glove test for dust. Service The staff were always very pleasant and quick to acknowledge me when I was around. They would ask me if I needed assistance even before I got a chance to ask. We asked for advice on directions and restaurant recommendations several times. Shuttle Service The drivers were very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. My one complaint with this service is that it fills up very quickly. We had to pre-plan all of our trips downtown and had to plan based on when a spot was open on the shuttle. It is not available on an ad hoc request basis as I thought it might be. We also had to share with the sister property at University Inn, which competed for seats. Location The biggest drawback for me was the location of the hotel. If you are not a fan of walking a lot, then the location can seem like it is in the middle of nowhere. We walked about a mile away to a local neighborhood area for some eclectic restaurant fare. The University is about a 20 minute walk and the downtown area requires a 20 minute shuttle ride (depending on traffic).

Although one assumes that it is dark if looked from outside, not confy to walk in undies with curtains up unless u r a stripper or in good shape( I am neither).

The people on staff, while young, were very friendly and helpful. There's nothing extra-ordinary about the hotel itself, but I think what really sold me in the first place were the unique amenities. I LOVE that they had bikes and helmets for loan that were in excellent condition. The trail is only a few blocks from the hotel, and we took advantage of a rare sunny winter day to bike through UW and down to the Gasworks Park. The second amenity that we loved were the ala carts. I requested the spa cart which came with a CD player and relaxing CD, bath products, etc. I think this is an ingenious idea to personalize a hotel stay as there are various carts to choose from. Third, just little touches like free secured parking, aveda bath products, bath robes, fresh cookies in the lobby, wine tastings, a general store with Trader Joe's snacks, a recycle bin in the room, a map built into your room key holder. The room itself was very clean, and while it had a nautical theme, the decor was not gaudy or tasteless. The setup of the room was smartly designed with appliances tucked in with the clothing closet. My only complaints are that the tub was pretty small, the breakfast was so-so, and the lights around the vanity were fluorescent and therefore made doing makeup and hair difficult. I appreciate that the hotel is striving to be \"green\"-- kudos-- but splurge on the vanity lights please. The location was convenient because we had our own car, but I could see getting around to be a bit difficult if you had business downtown to attend to every day.

Our stay was tainted by a rude and cold front desk employee who \"assisted\" us during the check-in process. Long story short, I called ahead to inform the hotel of our late arrival, but I guess the message never reached the staff on duty the morning we arrived. Lady at the front desk then \"welcomed\" us in the lobby by telling (scolding) me that \"you CAN'T be checking in, because we have no rooms.\" Lovely customer service skills! A lot of the staff do seem young so who really knows how well they communicate with each other. But nothing should warrant the unhelpful and practically hostile \"reception\" we received. Well we did get a room after another employee straightened things out... The room was clean and well-appointed. Beds were comfortable. The wall/door fronting the hall do seem thin (even for a hotel) so you could really hear a lot of outside activity at times.

I can only refer to my experience in the Suite Studios, but I was amazed at the size of these rooms. Very open and comfortable. - Very clean - Courteous staff - Simple, modern furnishings with a bit of nautical flair. It has a nice urban feel, without being aggressively modern and cold (I'm looking at you, \"W Hotel\"). - Nice, central location close to I-5, downtown, Greenlake, UW, the zoo, etc. - Themed complimentary carts are a cute idea - Free parking - Not quite as expensive as most Seattle downtown and upscale hotels - Very quiet. Seems like they have good sound-proofing to keep the noise of the city out. Things we didn't like: - Additional $10 for each person (beyond the first) seems like an odd pricing structure. It's only $10, but that is somewhat irritating when you are already paying a a fairly high rate + state tax + hotel tax. If you're traveling as a family, this is going to get very expensive. - Parking garage might be a bit difficult to maneuverer around in when it's crowded - Views from most rooms are not particularly fabulous. I imagine there's a couple that will give you a nice view of Downtown, but everything else tends to face nondescript neighborhoods and office buildings. And, that's really my only negatives.

The Watertown hotel has great bells and whistles, but first let's look at the basics: * Room size and layout - We had a suite--no complaints there. I especially liked having 2 sinks, one across from the bed and one next to the bathroom door. * Bed comfort - Excellent with a nice pillowtop mattress. * Cleanliness - Some hairs left behind from previous guest, but otherwise good. * Helpfulness of staff - Quite good. * Quietness - Here's where they fall down. We heard lots of noise from the room above. Very easy to hear footsteps above you. However, they appear to have double-paned windows, and you can't hear much noise from outside. On the weekend, there were a lot of teenagers talking noisily in the hallway, but the halls were quiet at all other times. * Temperature control - A bit difficult. The thermostat says high heat, low heat, high cool, low cool and fan only. Unlike a thermostat where you can set the temperature, it was challenging to get this room to stay at a comfortable temperature. * Water pressure in shower - mediocre but adequate. * Refrigerator - Tiny box fridge. * Free internet service with ethernet cable provided. * Free underground garage parking. Garage moderately difficult to maneuver in. Always found a parking space. To sum up the basics, they were average to above average, but definitely not excellent. There are other features, however, that further improve the quality of one's stay here: * Instead of nickel and diming you like a hotel that charges $3 to $6 for a small bottle of water, there is no bottle of water in the room. Instead, they filter the water for you in the room! * Free breakfast which my partner enjoyed (Foods listed in a previous review.) * Free happy hour wine tasting * Washing machine and dryer on every floor--free! (But be sure to take all your clothes out of the washer or dryer by 10 pm, or they'll get locked in the laundry closet. But if they do, a staff member will come upstairs and lock it for you.) * Their \"ala cart\" program. You can request one of a dozen or so carts. For example, their art cart has art supplies; their games card has board games, playing cards and music; and their spa cart has items including a hand held massager and aroma therapy. * Their gym is tiny but functional, and unlike other hotel gyms I've seen, this one lends you bicycles you can ride on the nearby Burke-Gilman trail. Another thing I love about this hotel is the location, in walking distance from many restaurants, Trader Joes, Half Price Books, and much more. As a vegan, I especially enjoy three of the restaurants in walking distance--Chaco Canyon Cafe (vegetarian, half raw foods), Araya's (vegan Thai), and Bombay Grill (Indian Food--not vegetarian, but vegetarian- and vegan-friendly.)

I just happended to see the Watertown's name on a map giving directions to Meany Hall and decided to look it up on the Internet to see if it would be suitable for us to stay there. The website was great and gave us a feel of what the property was like so I phoned and arranged for a room. Because I had CAA (similar to AAA, but the Canadian version), we were given a discount to $139.00 for the night. When we arrived and checked in we were very pleasantly surprised to find a charmingly modern room that had obviously been well thought out when it came to it's design. The room was nicely appointed with new furniture and the Aveda toiletries were certainly a bonus! The Watertown has a wonderful idea in its 'cart' system. Upon registration, I was asked what type of cart I'd like brought to the room. I chose a \"spa cart\" and when I came back after going for a walk, the cart had arrived complete with foot bath, massage wand, boom box and appropriate CDs for a calming and romantic ambience. I made sure I used everything!! ( There are many other types of carts from games, to art, to kids and even a grumpy cart if you need cheering up!) The bed was very comfortable that night and I got a good sleep. The complimentary breakfast the next morning was very nice - eggs, sausages, cereal, yogurt, danishes, toast, juices, soy milk!, skim milk!, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, bananas - and that is all I can remember although there were other choices too. The total hotel is very clean, fresh and well tended. The front desk staff was super and very helpful with lots of suggestions for whatever we needed. Another little perk they offer is bicycles they LEND out for those who want to take a spin around the university and surrounding areas. Lastly, the hotel has a free van that takes visitors to and picks them up from different venues around Seattle. We wanted to go to Pikes Market for the morning and Ivan the driver was so pleasant and courteous - even dropping us off at a particular spot we wanted to go to.

We booked the Watertown based upon reviews here at Tripadvisor. This hotel more than exceeded our expectations, particularly for hotels in its price range. First, the hotel. The rooms were large, clean and very modern in design, with an in-room safe, dorm-sized fridge, microwave, and coffee pot, complete with complementary coffee and popcorn. Views were so-so -- our room looked over an empty lot that was being rebuilt. If you want to see the Seattle skyline, then pay more for a downtown hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is a few blocks away from University Avenue, which is the main drag for the University of Washington -- lots of shops, restaurants, etc. Just around the corner from the hotel is a vegan restaurant, Araya, if you're looking for vegan/vegetarian cuisine. The hotel also has a free shuttle service to/from downtown, so you can park your car in the free and secure, gated parking lot at the hotel and let the drivers take you downtown and pick you up. You can get downtown on the hour and picked up on the half hour, and if you're not sure how long you'll be, you can call the front desk to arrange a pick-up time and one of two pre-arranged pick-up spots. When we were there, the downtown buses were free to ride, which made this service even more valuable. The hotel is also along several bus lines if you prefer that route. There is a major shopping mall just down down the street, including a 24-hour grocery store (QFC), though you'll need your car to get to it. If you live in the midwest, the QFC is part of the Kroger chain, so if you plan to buy some groceries for the room and want to take advantage of the loyalty discounts, bring your Kroger card, which they'll accept! The complementary breakfast is outstanding -- scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon (different each day we were there), lots of oatmeal, cereal, fresh fruit, muffins, bagels, toast, juice, coffee, tea, dairy and soy milk, etc. All you need to get started (or pack a light lunch...). The workout room is relatively small but functional -- couple of bikes, some free weights, a couple of treadmills -- and is also where the free washer and dryer unit is located. You need to supply your own detergent or buy it from the front desk. We didn't have any problems using the wash, but since there is only one of each, it could conceivably get busy, so plan accordingly. Although the gym closes at 10 p.m., you can access the washer/dryer throughout the night with your room key. Oh, and the hotel also features themed complementary \"carts\" that you may want to check out if you have some time in the room. We tried the spa cart, which included a portable massager, foot bath, some salts, tea, and other bath products. Very nice way to end a day of walking! Other carts included a computer/printer combo, kids carts, board games, etc. (Book the cart in advance or when you check-in). If you need internet access, the room comes with complementary wired internet and even includes the CAT-5 cable so you don't need to bring one. Our room TV lacked any A/V inputs so we couldn't watch any DVDs or Netflix downloads from our laptop, but since we didn't get into the room until late both nights, that didn't really matter to us. They do have a movie cart, though, if you want to borrow a TV/DVD hook-up and watch movies. As others have noted, the hotel also has a wine bar, but we didn't have a chance to try it ourselves. Prices for wine and food seemed reasonable, though. Overall, this hotel was a great value and we would definitely recommend it if you're looking for an affordable, unique alternative to traditional and expensive downtown hotels.", "Date": "September 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cThe best staff\u201d", "Author": "Vince77", "ReviewID": "UR8658927", "Content": "My wife and I stayed there for 2 nights in July.

Going back next year, will go back to the Watertown. Good place for business visitor, families, and groups. There were at least two women's volleyball teams staying there. Things I can recommend doing in Seattle: Sightseeing tour of the city to get your bearings. Go to the Space Needle, but for the best view of the city, pay $3, go to the top of the Columbia Center at 5th and Columbia. Pike Place Market-could go every day for food, people watching and street musicians. Walk about the waterfront. Take a short cruise around the harbor. Drive about 30 minutes away from Seattle and see Snoqualmie Falls. Took a 25-minute seaplane city tour with Kenmore Air from Lake Union area. UNBELIEVABLE.

We borrowed the relaxation cart (lovely spa products - body lotion, bath salts etc, a food spa, massage machine, CD player and relaxing cd's) and the internet cart (computer and printer), but there were loads more on offer - a games cart (lots of board games), kids cart (plug socket covers, kids bath toys etc), grumpy cart (not sure what was on this) night night cart (aromatherapy products and white noise machine) to name a few. Although the hotel is a bus ride out of Seattle's centre, it was still a great location, in the middle of the University district. There were lots of good bars & restaurants just a block away. The hotel provides a free shuttle service downtown and it's also on main bus routes. We reckoned this was one of the best hotels we'd ever stayed in when you considered the location, room, standard of breakfast, service etc. Didn't want to leave & would definately stay there if we ever visit Seattle.", "Date": "August 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "NCjohnboy", "ReviewID": "UR5593308", "Content": "What an enjoyable stay.

We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the chocolate chip cookies in the lobby. It was a good value for the price we were paying....until our 3rd day. We left at 7am in the morning and when we returned at 3pm I was surprised to see a maid's cart on the floor. I didn't think much of it until we went in our room and saw that the room wasn't made up. We were in town for a wedding that was starting in 2 hours, so we picked up a couple towels from the floor and started getting ready. While I was in the shower housekeeping stopped by. My husband explained that we were getting ready and to come back after 4pm. A few minutes later we got a call from the front desk saying that if we didn't get our room cleaned right then that it wouldn't be cleaned at all. Finally the front desk said that the room would be made up after 6pm. That was fine with us, since we were going to be out until late in the evening. To our surprise at 4pm housekeeping showed up again. We were almost ready, so told them to come back in 10 minutes and we would be gone. Two minutes later the front desk called and said that the maid had left and that our room would not be cleaned up. The conversation went back and forth with the front desk. Even at a Motel 6 I expect to have my room made up. In the end as we were leaving I gave the front desk my blackberry number and told them to have the manager call me if they were unable to get our room cleaned. The clerk at the front desk (who was giving us some serious attitude) got off the phone (with whom appeared to be the offsite manager) and announced that she was going to clean our room and to not exepct much since she wasn't a trained housekeeper. We returned to a room that appeared to be cleaned, except for that there were no bath towels in the room and instead we were left with 5 bath mats! Maybe that was the clerk's way of getting even with us. The front desk appeared to be staffed by college students and not once between Thursday and Sunday did we see a manager or someone who appeared over 25 years old. I really question who is in charge here. I shouldn't have to argue with a clerk over whether my room is going to be cleaned, especially when I was gone for 8 hours during the day. I did contact the manager when I returned home. They did say that my experience should not have happened. They offered me $20 off a future stay. No thank you. I'd rather stay some place where I can be assured of clean towels and no attitude! If everything is going well and you have low expectations, I think the Watertown is a fine place to stay.

If you're a serious biker, I'd call ahead and make sure there are some good ones available. - Free \"carts\" of various entertainments were available.

And there are chocolate chip cookies in the lobby. Rooms are nicely sized and attractive. Also lots of cable channels available. The Starbucks coffee and candies were a nice touch too.

They had absolutely no record of my name, my reservation, or my claim to a room. And of course, a Friday night, they had no room for me. Possibly it is not their fault. But I'm confident it is not my mistake, so it could only be an issue between them and the internet site. They were helpful about calling some places for me, to their credit, and helped me find a different place to stay. For these reasons, and the fact that this scale only goes as low as 1, I won't give them a zero for the review. Clearly there are some loose ends with their Internet sales and marketing.

When we called down for the morning call service, a young guy on the other line was yarning. I believe most staffs are students. In some way we felt like we were staying at a training hotel.

The fitness room is VERY small and not private (it opens to the breakfast area and has sidewalk-level windows in a busy college area). Unfortunately, a comfortable bed can make or break a hotel. We stayed in a suite, and our bed was EXTREMELY uncomfortable. To add to the coolness factor, the mattress was placed on a solid wood block with no boxspring. This made for a mattress that progressively felt firmer the longer you slept on it. The worst feeling in the world is to cut your sleep short in the morning because its just too uncomfortable. It took about an hour or so to work the kinks out of our back. In all, this hotel has a laundry list of things going for it. However, only the hotel and room decor is where they appear to have gone \"the extra mile.\" Everything else appears to have been added to bolster its amenities list, but not a whole lot of PRACTICAL thought went with it.
