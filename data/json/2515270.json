For the first time ever, I lost my temper at a hotel. Rather than write a review while I was still angry, I waited until I could write a balanced review of the hotel.. First, the good points. I love this location. I like the left bank for its cafes, small shops and real neighborhoods. I especially like this location--a few blocks from the Pont Royal over the Seine to the Louvre. The hotel is also very close to the Musee d'Orsay. There isn't a better way to see Paris than on the Seine and it's only a five minute walk from the hotel. I also liked the rooms -bright, extremely clean with good bathrooms. I want to thank the hotel for upgrading our rooms to the fifth floor. I appreciated it and was set to love this hotel. The public areas need a redo, but they started renovating the bar when we were there. The breakfast room atmosphere was welcoming thanks to the lovely lady who ran it. However, the breakfast wasn't very good. The hotel says the expensive restaurant next to it prepares the breakfast. I worry about an expensive restarant that stretches the fruit salad with canned cling peaches. This hotel has location, history and nice rooms, but it lacks the most important thing a hotel can have-hospitality. On the third day of my stay when I lost my temper, it wasn't because of a single incident. This is a small hotel and you see the concierge ( especially cold) and the people at reception several times a day. Rather than smile or say a greeting, they glance at you and then look away. It's not a welcome atmosphere. To be fair, I had just come from London where a stayed in a hotel that had extraordinary service. If you think I may just be an impossible-to-please guest, please see my review of the Egerton House Hotel in London.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cNot spectacular but good quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "French-Doctor", "ReviewID": "UR127403321", "Content": "Very pretty and comfortable hotel.

The room decor is subdued and elegant, and the bed and linens were most comfortable. The deep tub and shower had fine pressure, leading to indulgent baths every night. For those who want to forego the cost of minibar items, there is a supermarket across the street. The Left Bank could not be closer -- 3 blocks to the Seine and Quai Voltaire. One block to the Rue du Bac Metro station. Several good restaurants within 3 blocks. The hotel service was impeccable.

I am an experienced global business traveler and Pont Royal gave me one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a hotel of that caliber. The value for the money is horrible. My first warning of poor service was upon arrival when no hotel staff came to assist with my suitcase or my wife\u2019s. I then entered the lobby and encountered a very angry guest who was speaking (more like yelling) to one of the staff in a very animated way. She kept repeating, \u201chow could you do this to me, you know I stay here all the time.\u201d I then lined up to check-in and another angry guest was yelling at the receptionist about being given the wrong category of room. Check-in for me went smoothly but the room was small and faced the front of the hotel. That was OK until the heating and cooling system broke down and the room became unbearably hot. When I opened the window for fresh air, the street noise was overwhelming. The result was ZERO sleep for both my wife and I. Thank God we stayed only two nights. Upon checking out I was informed by the receptionist, who I interrupted while he was in an argument with another member of the hotel\u2019s staff, that the heating and cooling system would not be fixed for several days due to no maintenance company being available to fix it! The morning before we checked out I asked the hotel staff to order a cab for a 7am pickup to take us to the airport for an early flight to Milan. I double checked my cab request the same afternoon and was told that it had been arranged. My wife and I decided to check out early to get out of the overheated room. While checking out I asked the receptionist if my 7am taxi had arrived. I was told that it had been ordered for 8am! Our flight to Milan would have been missed if my wife and I had not decided to checkout early to escape the unbearable room! While waiting for the cab to arrive I had to listen to the receptionist complain to me about what an awful place Hotel Pont Royal was to work and that most of the staff was demoralized and are looking for other jobs.

The Raphael had \"faded elegance\" while the Pont Royal is all new, deorated in the Art Deo style. The difference in room size is enormous. My Pont Royal room has a lovely view (my Raphael room had none) but one has to be extremely efficient with space. The Raphael's room was enormous. The staff at the Raphael was slightly better trained than at the Pont Royal. One example of an atmospheric difference: at the Raphael I could (and did) leave my shoes outside my room at night to be polished. At the Pont Royal this is a special service one has to arrange through the concierge. Both concierges did not hesitate to make and cancel reservations. Our Pont Royal room was not properly prepared our first night (it was very cold) but this corrected quickly. Internet is frustrating at both hotels. At the Raphael it is a paid service that had frequent interruptions. At the Pont Royal, an ethnet link is provided in the room (useless for my wife's laptop) and there is free wifi that must be accessed in the lobby. So when you read reviews critical of hotels based on their wifi mishaps, I think you have to realize the technology is just not there yet so that one could plan wifi in advance, like one can expect a working television for example. Regarding the room's size, i do not have the experience to compare the Pont Royal with other hotels on the Left Bank, but by reputation they all have small rooms.

First off, our flight got us in at 7:30 AM and after a night of no sleep on the plane, we were hoping to get checked-in early. But to our disappointment when we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by the rudest man working the desk. He refused to even check if there was a room available and kept telling us we cannot check-in until 2:00pm - that was a good 6 hours away and we had arrived on a sunday (ie. everything in paris is closed!). We sat in the lobby for hours and kept checking back with the front desk. Finally a woman came and seemed nicer and said that there should be a room available and as she was checking of course the rude man came back and said something to her in french and assured us there were no rooms available - which seemed off because we had seen at least 10 couples check out while we were waiting. We quickly came to the conclusion that we need to catch the nicer woman when she is alone so the minute the rude man left, we went back up to her and she gave us a room. That was just the beginning of many similar stories at the pont royal. The room was TINY.. the double bed was 2 uneven twins stuck together, the heating did not work (and it was COLD in november), the bathroom smelled and everytime we asked the concierge to book us a dinner, he would get the date or time wrong. Not to mention, everytime we would call the front desk to check on the status of our requests (for blankets etc), they would screen us and we would have to go down in the middle of the night to find someone there just not picking up our calls.

Located smack in the heart of the left bank of Paris in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e8s, it's within walking distance of anything you came to Paris to see. The Pont Royal is a smaller type of boutique sort of hotel with all the ambiance and turn of the century Paris charm you probably traveled here for. There's a top chef style restaurant on the main floor, and the wood paneled old world LIterary Bar reeks of Hemingway, of which the hotel claims used to be one of his haunts. The rooms are European style, or small by American standards, but well maintained and spotlessly clean. Lotsa marble, and period furnishings. During our stay they were shooting a movie on the floor which we were staying, so they moved us to a suite so we wouldn't be bothered through the late evening. Talk about your ambiance in a hotel, and one steeped in history as well. The painters Miro, Chagall, and Buffet are all noted as former guests at the Pont Royal. The best thing about the hotel in my opinion though is the location. Two blocks from Boulevard Ste Germain des Pres, you can see the Lourve down the street from the lobby, about a 6 minute walk to the Musee d'Orsay, and the Seine is just before the Lourve. Topping that, there is a Metro stop about a block and a half west of the hotel entry, making it easy to get wherever you wish to go to in Paris a breeze. The area abounds with bakeries, great restaurants, the Cafe de Flore of legend ( a hang out for Jim Morrison, Hemmingway, Sartre, etc.), and the Latin Quarter and Arts district are an easy walk.

We made our selection of this hotel premised upon reviews that we had read on Trip Advisor ourselves. Unfortunately, our stay fell far short of the great experieces that we had enjoyed at other properties and with a cruise line during this special trip. The Hotel Pont Royal was located in a fine location, however, that is the only positive that I can share of our stay. Upon booking our trip I let the management know on several occasions that this was a \"Honeymoon\" trip and that we would appreciate anything \"special\" that that might done for us during our stay. Throughout our trip at other hotels and on the cruise line we had been given perks from champagne, flowers, chocolate, fruit baskets, chocolate covered strawberries and even room upgrades where the facilities could provide them. All without asking! The Hotel Pont Royal did nothing and in fact never responded to simple promises and requests. The room was very poorly decorated with outdated linens from my guess, the 60's. We kindly asked for another room at the same price that was hopefully more elegantly decorated. The Management never even got back to us! We asked the concierge to make dinner reservations for us, but was never responded to with the information. One night we asked for a reservation at the well-known French Restaraunt attached to the hotel; as we had dined at another of this chef's restaraunt in Monte Carlo and enjoyed it. This time we waited for nearly 40 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. I believe our request was never made! The most frustrating for us was the fact that we had arranged with the management during our booking to provide us with a driver to pick us up and return us to the airport on the day of our departure. I checked upon our arrival and was told that all appeared to be in order. When it came time to leave however, the driver never showed and consequently we nearly missed our flight back to the states. Very poor service with little follow-up if I might say! There were several apologies extended, but that was it.

All I can say is that this is a very average hotel and definitely not worth the price they're charging. As previous reviewers have stated, the location is fantastic and easy walking distance to just about everything you'd want to see. We chose it because if it's location near Saint Germain des Pres and the fabulous shops and restaurants. We spent a lot of time walking around the Latin Quarter, Ile Saint Louis, Notre Dame and Centre Pompidou and this hotel was a perfect starting point to get to all of those locations. As for the hotel itself, the rooms need a MAJOR renovation. The lobby is lovely but once you get to your room it's a total disconnect. We were told when we arrived that we had been upgraded to a Superior room--which is great--except when we saw it we immediately asked what made this room different from the room we had booked and they said, 'nothing, they're basically the exact same'. So much for the upgrade. The room was extremely tiny and the decor is outdated and crappy. We were only in our room for about 5 minutes before it became obvious to us that it could not sustain electricity as well. We were then moved to another room (same shape and size) on a higher floor. The only redeeming value of this room was that it had a balcony--which we loved and sat outside having cocktails at sundown. You should be aware that the rooms do not in any way resemble what you will see on their pamphlets and advertisements. These rooms are completely different and don't even seem like they're from the same hotel. Nothing is similar except the look of the lobby. On positive note, the staff was lovely and accommodating. In sum, I would not spend the money to stay here again. I've been to Paris many times and this was by far the worst hotel in terms of the look of their hotel rooms versus price.

Our package included a driver picking us up from the airport (which was so wonderful after a 13 hour flight), a junior suite, complimentary breakfast buffet in the tea room and VIP service. We felt like VIP guests. The staff treated us very very well. There were no communication barriers and anytime we needed something they were there to help.

We were within walking distance of everything or if not then the metro station was a couple of steps away or the train stations. We walked down to the Latin Quarter almost every night for dinner, where we found the nightlife to be lively and the prices not so expensive since we were in a college district. We did not eat at the restaurant at the hotel because we had read prior it is super expensive and we saw the prices which confirmed it. There are plenty of nearby local restaurants to eat at for the fraction of the cost. Also, there is a wonderful bakery down the street where the croissonts are to die for.

This is not one of the better locations or for that matter, one of the better small hotels in Paris.", "Date": "November 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athlone", "Title": "\u201cOK but could have been better\u201d", "Author": "UnaDaly", "ReviewID": "UR4092081", "Content": "I chose this hotel on the recommendation of a travel agent. Upgraded to a deluxe room based on reviews from the tripadvisor site. Glad I did so. The room was a reasonable size with a good sized bathroom and lovely view. However, the room was not huge, have stayed in other deluxe rooms and this was just about average. The concierge (George), though, was wonderful. He was quite frankly the best thing about this hotel. When I spoke French to most of the other hotel staff they replied in English. George was the only one not to reply in English but French. My French is quite rusty but I was looking forward to practicing in France. The location of the hotel is wonderful as it is very close to the Musee d'Orsay and the Seine. Be warned, however, do not eat at the hotel's restaurant. This consists of barstools at a bar and the heat is unbearable. The fixed menu costs 98EURO per person for sitting on a bar stool. Overpriced and overrated. There is a fantastic restaurant on the rue de Verneuil (out of the hotel door and 2nd street on the left) called Le Rouge Vif. This is fabulous and reasonably priced. A joy to eat in. If I was going back to Paris again, I would not stay at this hotel again. Although the room was lovely the hotel itself was just adequate. The high cost paid is too much for the merely adequate.", "Date": "November 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel!

After reading a number of great reviews on this site, I had high expectations and they were met. First of all, the location absolutely cannot be beaten. You are 3 blocks behind the Musee d'Orsay and directly across the river from the Louvre, rue de Rivoli and close to the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame. There is a Metro station 1 block from the hotel allowing quick access to all of Paris. Our room was beautiful, not super big, but very comfortable with lots of dark wood (just like their website). The bathroom was very nice, lots of marble, bright and super clean. Our room was turned down 3-4 times a day and the maid service was impeccable. The front desk and concierge staff were very nice. Bruno and Pierre were great, and even managed to get us last minute tickets to the opera. The daily breakfast was quite good with lots of freshly squeezed juice and our favourite, Parisian croissants. All in all, a fantastic location and excellent hotel.", "Date": "October 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norman, OK", "Title": "\u201cHotel Pont Royal\u201d", "Author": "swaffy", "ReviewID": "UR4013145", "Content": "The hotel is very nice, the rooms are clean and the bathrooms have been updated and are very modern.

The halls had a very nice fresh citrus smell. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel (quite expensive) -because there were plenty of nice cafes around the area (especially Le Terminus (right on Rue du Bac across the Musee d'Orsay Museum- walking distance of 3 blocks away). Our only meal at the hotel was on the last day of our stay when we ordered room service (pricey but the steak tasted great). The hotel site was awesome in terms of location -literally 5-10 minutes to the Musee d'Orsay, 10min to the Seine River, 10-15min to the Louve, 20min to Notre Dame/Ile de Cite, 15min to to St.Germain area, and easy access to the metro/RER subway system to the Eiffel Tower as well to other sites. Everywhere we went was pretty much walkable from the hotel. We booked our trip via Expedia- including our day excursions with Paris Vision - and lucky us that the Paris Vision office (site of where the tours begin) was 15min away from our hotel. The staff was lovely and helpful. Lovely bathrobes and slippers in the room (although they forgot to put in the room when we arrived). We would definitely stay at the Hotel Pont Royal again.

We had balcony to the front which was nice but the road is quite noisy and with building work opposite made for a early wake-up call. The room was very clean, and the shower good. The breakfast was so madly expensive it was a joke, as was the mini bar. We did have a complementary bottle of wine which was welcomed before our Moulin Rouge trip. The hotel was fine, believe me and perhaps we are not experienced enough as to what to expect. Concierge service as FAB - lovely guy who was so helpful at all times.
