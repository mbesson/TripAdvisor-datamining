We always stop in Daytona Beach on our way to visit family in Ft. Lauderdale, and some of the places we have stayed at have been not as nice as La Quinta. For the price we paid and for what we got, it was a good value. I liked the room. It was a good sized room, and it was clean. In the humid climate, it is a plus that they have tiled flooring instead of carpeting in the area where you walk with dirty, sandy feet. The shower and toilet are separate from the sink, which I always consider to be a plus when you are sharing a room with another person. The TV was old school, but it was large enough and had good reception. The bedspreads were clean and in good condition. I was very happy with the cotton blanket! Yes, it seemed to be freshly laundered, not some ratty blanket that has not seen a washing in some unknown period of time. The bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was standard chain motel food: waffles, coffee, yogurt, etc. A couple of things I did not like about the room: One was the noisy air-conditioner. I turned it off at one point because of the noisy sound coming from it. The other thing that bothered me a great deal was the harsh-white fluorescent lighting in the room. How can you relax in your room when the lighting resembles that of an office building? Perhaps some soft-white CFL's can be added to make the room cozier. The outside area was clean and nice. The pool was clean, as was the hot tub. There was a large deck area with umbrellas both beside the pool and outside of the pool area. Dogs are not allowed in that area, so if you bring a dog, plan to walk him somewhere else. There is easy beach access, with a shower and faucet for clean-up when you are finished with the beach.

First of all, the pets are confined to your room, the parking lot, and a little 10x15 fenced in patch for doing their business. I had sign a waiver that if my dog made too much noise, and the neighbors complained that I was responsible to pay for their room. Also we could not leave our puppy in the room alone at any time, nor was she allowed to be on any of the furniture. Not that I would invite her to jump on the sofa, but I was worried she may decide to pop up on it and I would be charged a $ 100 extra for cleaning. The hotel itself is nice, a bit tired, but great views and pool area. The beds are comfortable, and the free wi-fi made it nice since I was on puppy duty the entire stay. The bathroom was small, but adequate, and the room came with a microwave, and small fridge. Breakfast was nothing to dream about, the breakfast room is not nearly large enough to handle the morning rush, but food was well stocked, and kept clean.

Bed was comfortable, but comforter was not clean, sliding door was very hard to open.

The delivery driver lied about why it took so long (we had been calling the manager of the pizza place constantly, so we knew what was up). Food made us ill the next morning.

Then, 4 springs fell out of the bottom of it, where her feet would lay, and there was a huge dip in it. Squeaked horribly with the smallest movement. Told man at front desk and he just said \"sorry.\" Not the cleanest room, but ok. Sheets stained and had to get bedding for the fold out couch. Sink clogged. another lady was complaining to front desk that her pull out couch was dirty, smelled of urine, and asked for a refund and was checking out. I don't know what happened there. Parking is a nightmare! Not enough stalls and if you're lucky to get one, they are so narrowly spaced apart, you can't back out! All those trucks and you can't even move! Double beds in our \"family\" suite? It's one large room, with a half divider, only 2 chairs. No workout room, as advertised. You enter your room from the outside, like an old fashioned motel. Loud and noisy people stay here. Forget about getting any breakfast! Poorly stocked. The overworked desk person has to answer phones, check in customers and stock the breakfast!

For starters you wont find transient type guests at this hotel the way you often do at many other mid range priced Daytona properties. All of the guests are travelers on vacation, and its a very family friendly atmosphere. The rooms are recently renovated, very comfortable beds, and easily the best pillows ive ever slept on in a hotel. The AC is cold, and rooms are equipped with microwave, and decent size fridge, coffee maker, and hair dryer. The tv gets 73 channels plus HBO, and the walls are very thick so you will not hear any noise from the rooms on either side of you. Beyond the rooms, a breezeway with tropical music playing leads to the pool area, which is both is clean and inviting, Also the pool has a very unique mushroom shaped fountain where you can douse yourself with flowing cold water on a hot florida day. If the pool isnt your thing, the hotel is right on the beach and you can walk from your room to the ocean in literally 3 minutes. The location in daytona is also excellent, less than a mile from the Ocean walk shoppes restaurants, and boardwalk amusement activities, and only a quarter mile from the clubs ,bars and other nightlife on Seabreeze Blvd. The staff is friendly welcoming and accomodating, especially front desk clerk Daniel, and the 2 managers karli and Tony. There lobby is also very attractive, and offers free coffee 24-7, a business center with a computer, and printer, available 24-7, and a free daily continental breakfast with everything from donuts, english muffins, danish's , and even waffles, as well as juice and coffee.

There was a TV and fridge with a (noisy) A/C unit. The 2nd 'bedroom' was just off of the first. The only (very small) bathroom was located in the 2nd bedroom so there wasn't much privacy but it was very quiet back in the 2nd bedroom. However, there were no windows in the back bedroom or bathroom, so it was a little claustrophobic. One concern is the parking. After waiting for a while for an empty parking spot, we met up with the nighttime security guard who found us a spot. We ended up having to park along the edge of the parking lot. Anyone with poor driving skills (or too much to drink) might have easily clipped our car.

It was clean, beautiful, nicely decorated, updated, and well-kept...but what really makes their customer service was what really made them shine. It was impeccable! From the night clerks to the day clerks to the management to the house and ground keepers, everyone was warm and friendly, corteous and helpful. In todayls society, I found it nothing short of astounding how nicely we were treated. Our first room was a nice, spacious room with a king and beautiful updated bathroom and vanity for only $89/ night. They allowed our 2 mini dashunds and didn't cahrge a pet fee. Unfortunately, the toilet didn't flush, but that happens, I didn't get the impression it was due to poor maintenance. They didn't have any other 2nd floor rooms with king size beds and I don't care for 1st floor rooms in any hotel near an ocean cause they always smell musty to me, so they upgraded us to the biggest oceanfront room in the hotel! It had 2 queens, a fridge, microwave, pull out couch, balcony over the pool, and a stunning ocean view. Very nice tile flooring, black granite-looking vanity and shower walls, beautiful gold duvet bedspreads, and nice sized flat screen tv (which we didn't watch, but woulve been nice if we had). The room we were in is normally $134/night. The nexy day the toilet was fixed in the original room and we enquired about whether we'd have to pay full price to stay in the oceanfront suite. The manager allowed us to stay in his nicest room for $99/night the rest of our stay, which I thought was more than fair. The continental breakfast is not extraordinary, but its not bad. You can make yourself waffles and there are decent pastries, cereal, bagels, and toast. There is also coffee and juice. For pet owners- when you arrive they make you sign a pet policy that is pretty intimidating. Don't let that scare you off! It says you can't leave them unattended in the room, which is completely impractical bc pets are not allowed on the beach, in restaurants, or shops and Daytona is way too hot to leave your pets in the car. So I asked the manager about it and he said it is not strictly enforced, but they must have to a policy in place bc they've had problems in the past with dogs who barked so incessantly that it disturbed other guests. So, in short, you can leave your dogs in the room unattended, but you must use the \"do not disturb\" sign so housekeeping knows and you are required to provide your cell # in case they get complaints about your dog. If your dogs begin to disrupt other guests, you are expected to come back to the hotel. We had no problems whatsoever! We pulled the curtain so our dogs wouldn't bark at people walking by and we asked housekeeping to clean our rooms when we took our dogs for a walk in the morning. They were very accomodating. There is not a lot of grass available for dogs to go potty, so we walked them to the nearest landscaped areas around the hotel. We didn't get a single dirty look from staff, but we were also very respectful and picked up behind our dogs like civilized people ought to do. Last, but not least, I should mention there is limited parking. If you arrive later in the evening, you will have to park in the lot across the street. We are a young couple so that wasn't the end of the world for us. But for older people or couples with young kids, it might be annoying. Overall, I am extremely impressed with La Quinta. My sister and her hubby also stayed there and after having problems with the hot water and the dead bolt, they were upgraded to an oceanfront room for free.

We were able to walk to and from the Ocean Center from this hotel as it is just under a mile and a straight shot down the road. Our dog is not a \"barker\", so we felt confident we could leave her in the room with no problems. Unlike a previous poster, we specifically asked the front desk staff about leaving her alone and they said that would be fine, and just asked us for our cell number in case a problem arose. We did sign a \"pet agreement\" agreeing to be responsible for any possible damages. We even got a welcome packet with several goodies when we checked in with lotion, chips, water, etc.(we are rewards members which you can join for free). The front desk staff could not have been more polite, courteous, and helpful. They gave me directions, recommendations, and promptly assisted me when I accidently locked myself out of my room. :-( We originally booked for a ground floor city view room, but were able to upgrade to an oceanfront room for only $20. more. I did glance into one of the city view rooms when the door was open while they cleaned it, and they looked much smaller. They offered to give us a 2nd or 3rd floor room, but we opted to stay on the ground floor oceanfront since we had the dog. The room was large with nice tile and granite countertops. The sink was outside the bathroom and we had a fridge, microwave, beautiful view of the ocean, comfortable bed, flatscreen lcd hd tv, inroom safe, iron, coffeemaker and hairdryer. The bathroom had a nice tub and good adjustable showerhead. The 2nd and 3rd floor oceanfront rooms have balconies and the groundfloor a patio area which you can access from your room. The area is landscaped very nicely with a fountain, small grassy area, and tables and chairs. The signs say \"no dogs on the grass\", but we did let our dog sit with us on the concrete at the tables and chairs that night with no problems. Beside the patio and grassy area is an enclosed pool area that looked nice, but was a little too chilly for us to enjoy. We could see the ocean just fine from our room, too, even though it was on the ground floor. There are stairs that you can walk down to access the beach, but we just enjoyed the gorgeous view from the outside patio area with our bottle of wine and our dog on her leash. I noticed (as another poster did) that there are several cameras in the pool and patio area and some are aimed at the balconies, so do keep your curtins pulled for privacy. I do understand why they have these cameras as Daytona Beach has a reputation for being a place where students and bikers may drink and party and accidents can happen. Unfortunately, too many students have fallen from hotel balconies in Daytona during spring break. I know all the cruise ships have cameras everywhere, too, including pointing at the balconies, but that isn't going to stop me from enjoying myself. One poster also mentioned a lack of place to walk your dog, but there is currently a vacant lot beside the La Quinta in the front with grass where you can walk your dog with no problems. We were able to park our car (free parking) right outside the room which was convenient. The hotel has complimentary copies of USA today in the lobby on weekdays and there is free wireless internet that worked fine after we entered the user id and password that the front desk gave us. There is also a small business center beside the breakfast area that has a desktop computer that you can use for free if you don't have a laptop with you. A printer is attached, but there is an additional fee of $1.00 per page if you need to print anything. The ice machine I used on the ground floor worked with no issues. You get the ice out by sticking your room key in the machine to activate it. Breakfast was fine...cereal, fruit, coffee, tea, milk, juices, hard boiled eggs, waffle maker, muffins, toast, etc. We paid $82.10 for our upgrade to an oceanfront room (low season rates) and booked directly through the La Quinta site. We have stayed at a lot of La Quintas since they allow pets, but this one was especially nice being right on the beach.

The balconies offer a magnificent view of the beach and ocean. In general, the rooms are clean and elegantly furnished - some have a dark wood style and others (like ours) was done in a white stone style that makes you think of old Rome or Greece. Our room also had a nice stone two-person sauna bath in the middle of the room. So why then wouldn't I stay here again? It isn't because they installed the sink and shower faucets the wrong way so that when you turn on the cold water you get scalded with hot water. Mistakes happen. It isn't because we had to ask twice for an alarm clock and toilet paper for our room and finally had to go down to the front desk to get one. Mistakes happen. It is because, after a couple of nights I was standing on the balcony and listening to the rushing of the waves under a beautiful starry sky when I suddenly noticed a large white pole sticking up among the trees and plants of the garden. At the top of the pole was something that had a small ring of tiny red lights on it. It really startled me. I looked down the length of the building and noticed two more such poles with little red lights. But since I couldn't see it clearly in the dark I decided to wait until morning to check it out. The next morning i discovered that it was exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be - video cameras! And one of them was aimed right at our balcony looking into our third-floor room! (SEE MY PHOTO). Conveniently the bed is situated right in front of the balcony. I can understand a camera facing the parking lot, front office and even the pool area - but aimed into the back of our room?! To me that is crossing the line between security and peeping tom! I plan on calling my attorney about the legality of this when I have a chance, and I also plan to notify the local press.

I can understand not wanting pets near the pool area, but at a PET FRIENDLY hotel you would think they would have some designated place to use as a dog walk area. When I inquired at the front desk i was very nicely told that the only place available was a postage stamp sized landscaped area in front of the hotel, right on the street behind the welcome sign... While inside i noticed the LONG list of pet policies this hotel has; none of which are posted on their website. Apparently they reserve the right to charge you $100 per complaint they receive about your pet. Pretty friendly, huh? The location of this hotel and the pool and beach access are great, but I would not return even without my dogs. Their only saving grace was that we were only staying 1 night and due to a promo only paid $77 plus taxes. I absolutely would not recommend this place if you are traveling with pets!", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value we'll be back\u201d", "Author": "coachklein", "ReviewID": "UR116762881", "Content": "Very nice, clean rooms.

We bought ant traps for our patio area. None of the 3 ice machines had ice. We went a full two days without the luxury of warm or hot water. The only other issue of this property, never seems to be enough parking and sometimes you have to park across the street and it does not appear secure.

Upon arrival and check in we were informed that the elevator was broken and I was with a handicapped guest. We both had to walk up 3 flights of stairs with coolers, and baggage at least five 5 times. It took at least 4 hours for the repair to be complete and again my guest had multiple leg and back surgeries and walking up and down stairs was very painful so he did not leave the room what a way to start a vacation! No one at hotel offered to help the handicapped guest and they knew he was handicapped because they provided a handicapped space and placard for his car window. 2. Next incident was when the pool was treated with chemicals at 12 o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon. All the guest were told to get out of the pool for at least 30 minutes. Some kids did not get out fast enough so the pool attendant screamed at the kids. I reported to this to the Manager and he said he is not on his staff and cannot tell him when to clean pool. I said he should suggest he come during the week and he dismissed me. 3. Our car was broken into and $200 in cash was taken along with some tools. We were not aware of the theft until we got back home so it was not reported. 4. A drunk was allowed to eat breakfast in the lobby 2 days that I was there. He continually fell asleep with his head almost landed in his food at least a dozen times, this was not a family friendly situation. He also wasted a tremendous amount of food each day, I am talking about 5 doughnuts, 8 boiled eggs, several juices, 2 coffees and many bowls of cereal. I did report this to the front desk and they said \u201cagain??\u201d This front desk clerk was there that day and have a clear view of the man. He also later hung out by the pool with even more food in white Styrofoam plates and bowls so I assume it was from the breakfast area. I know he was not a guest because I saw him walk out of the lobby the first day and not be there all day then he showed up the next morning in the same clothes. He had no room key, appeared disheveled and certainly not able to afford a room at this hotel. 5. Another item in disrepair was the ice machine, I reported this early in my stay and it was never fixed. Even with all these problems when I asked for a discount and I was given 20 or 30 dollars off my bill.

I have stayed at several other hotels in Daytona and to me this was the best hotel. There are more expensive hotels with all the bells and whistles then there are dumps at very cheap prices. This hotel is right in the middle and to me that is a good thing. The hotel is only 3 story's high. I can't stand the other higher hotels in the area! It means more people, more trouble, more headaches! I wanted a balcony room but we ended up on the bottom floor due to king jacuzzi room and after getting settled in, I would have rather had the bottom floor than the balcony! We were only a few steps away from the outside sitting area, pool and beach. Now if you perfer the balcony thats fine you can take the elevator or stairs all day long, but to just walk out the sliding door and walk out onto everything I found more relaxing. This is not a crowed hotel and personel or the manager is constantly walking around making sure everything and everyone is ok. (yes I said manager - which i find comforting than the normal stay behind my desk manager) The reviews I have read are true to form. There are a few glitches while staying here, but no hotel is perfect as some snooty people want them to be and no one for that matter is perfect either. My only problem I had staying there and again this is being on the bottom floor, was some idiot on the third floor decided to toss out old coffee and it landed on me. Prompt superman speed from the front desk and manager the problem was taken care of. The morning breakfast was plentyfull, I took mine back to my room and no one said anything. The maid was nice when she was cleaning another room and I asked for extra coffee cups. Everything worked in the room, did not have a problem with seeing any bugs, dead remote batteries, dirty sheets, cold water, and other misc compalints people write about. I too loved the grass area right outside my door, I walked around bare footed majority of the time, because i felt safe, there was always maintance man walking around picking up after everyone. Keeping the grounds in order. The neat things I noticed about the hotel was there is a outside shower to get all the sand off you before you came back up the stairs to the outside sitting area, also the kiddie pool has a fountain shower I saw all the kids giggle and having a good time in and the ice machines....there isn't anyone coming on that property to take ice that isn't a guest..lol..because it takes your room key to use the ice machine ;) The front desk does have camaras and they are constantly watching the outside area so if people are horse playing around or disturbing other people, security is prompt to go outside and check things out. I felt very secure here. I had such a relaxing time, shame was only for the night, but I will go back again with no hesitations. ohh, and the Saturday night fireworks were neat to watch. My only other complaint which is just personal with me is its not central air, and only option is the turn knobs for low cool or high cool (or heat) so I never knew what the tempreture was. I am a hot natured person and even with the bed next to the AC blowing on me, I was still a little un comfortable, but again that is just me, because my husband was freezing and other guests had their sliding doors open enjoying the cool beach breeze. But, I felt I needed to mention this, incase there are other hot natured people out there.

The hotel is old, but the room we had was clean. However, the toilet wouldn't flush properly; took 3-4 attempts to just flush it completely. The first day we were 'walked in on' twice within a couple of hours. The first time was a housecleaning person who wouldn't make eye contact when I asked her why she just walked in our locked room. She never gave me an answer. The second was a hotel staff person saying he had a complaint about the nightstand being broken. I told him that we'd only been there for a couple of hours and he was the second person to just walk in unannounced; oh, and no there was no problem with the nightstand. He apologized at least and said the front desk didn't have us as \"checked in\" yet. The first morning we were greeted with a stern warning letter on our windshield that our car would be towed because we were not registered guests. We registered our license plate number and car when we checked in. We took the letter to the front desk and she just blew it off with a sorry, no problem attitude. Second day we were told by our colleagues who booked the rooms (over $5,000,00 worth of rooms by the way) that the manager had banged on their door and told them they had to vacate their two suites because they were being moved to less expensive rooms. When he explained that these suites were booked and paid for thru the weekend, the manager basically called him a liar and said he was forcing them all to move because he'd booked someone else in these suites. Then he proceeded to bang on the door of the other suite where people were sleeping and when they answered the door he said to get out. Needless to say our colleagues left the hotel completely. And then called us to warn us of what happened and that there shouldn't be a problem with our room; but to let them know if there was. That afternoon we were lounging in our room, reading, because is was raining. We had the sliding door open for fresh air and the same manager was suddenly standing outside our sliding door yelling, 'hello, hello!' When we asked him what he wanted, he lectured us on leaving the door unlocked when we weren't in the room. Odd, because we were IN the room at the time and we informed him nicely that we weren't idiots and wouldn't leave a sliding door unlocked if weren't there. (even though two of his employees found it necessary to just walk into our locked room with the master key without knocking....). When the rain stopped, we went out onto the patio to relax but it was still windy from the passing storms. A beer bottle blew off of one of the balconies and shattered. Since there were children still running from the pool to the beach barefoot, I called the front desk to report the shattered bottle. The manager was rude and showed up at our room again giving us the 3rd degree on how it fell, whose was it, where did it come from, etc... Instead of cleaning up the mess he was trying to accuse us or anyone he could find for breaking the bottle. After 4 different barefoot kids ran through the glass, he finally stopped the inquisition and started sweeping up the glass.

One of the few upsides to this stay was that we redeemed La Quinta points and our stay was reasonably cheap. However, I was charged $10 per person per night for my two 18 year old sons, which I think is ridiculous. I'm not sure if this is LQ policy, or just this hotels policy. It seems ridiculous to me to have to pay extra for a family member. My kids just turned 18, this was their graduation present, and they still live under my roof. Rooms - The \"two room\" rooms are exactly that, two rooms. One room w/beds in it and one room w/tv & couch in it. In my conversation with the hotel prior to our arrival, I was led to believe it was a \"two bedroom\" room, a bed in each room and a seperate room for tv/couch. Cleanliness - The closet had a moldy/musty smell. We were afraid to hang our clothes in it for fear they would absorb the smell. We had a no-smoking room and it was fine the first few days, but after about the third day it started smelling like stale smoke. We realized the rooms were \"cleaned\" very strongly between guests and the cleaning solutions were wearing off and the true odor of the room was coming out by this time. Facilities-they have two washers and two dryers at this hotel. One washer was \"out of order\" the entire week we were there. The \"workout room\" is a joke. It also had a \"out of order\" sign on the door the entire week we were there. Obviously it had been that way for a while and would most likely continue to be.....there was sheetrock, ladders, saws and lots of other construction supplies stored in there. The \"workout room\" should instead be labeled \"supply room\". As others have posted, you are being watched. They have cameras all over the property and will call your room if they see you doing something they percieve as \"wrong\". I drive a 4 door truck and was limited to certain parking spaces in their very small lot. One afternoon we made a fast run back to our room from shopping and were leaving again within 5 minutes and the front desk called to tell me I needed to move my truck as I was \"in the way\". This really set me off as it was the middle of the afternoon when the parking lot was mostly empty as everyone is out sight seeing. I was parked legally in front of my room, but they perceived this as \"wrong\" because my truck is larger than most of the other cars in the parking lot. I try to be courteous, and was not \"in the way\" as they said. I made sure of this before we got out of the truck. As there are only balconies on the rooms that face the ocean, lots of the guests would set their lawn chairs up and hang out in front of their rooms in the walk ways. Beer bottles and pizza boxes were usually found in the walkways in the morning. It is definitely not a 5 star hotel. Housekeeping - they were great. Gave you anything you needed. Location - definitely not in the middle of everything. This could be good or bad depending on what you're looking for. We had to drive everywhere we went. Breakfast - suprisingly decent. No meat of any kind, but an ample supply of pastries, cereal, fruit, breads. Nothing to get too excited about, but I've seen worse. Often times had to wait for desk clerk to replenish. Upkeep - I did not see anyone doing any sort of maintenance on the hotel at any time during our stay. The parking lot was never washed off/swept up. The washer in the laundry room was never repaired. The balcony railings on the ocean side were in need of painting. They did not enforce the \"no dogs in this area\" rule (dogs were on the patio and using the grassy area nearby for their potty). I am a dog lover, but am not a friend of their poop in the grass :) Management - manager hides behind wall at front desk watching his cameras and lets employees handle disgruntled guests. After the guest leaves the room, the manager will walk out from behind the wall and talk about the guest to the employee. I saw this on more than one occasion as we were eating breakfast . Overall, Daytona Beach was a great place and we had a good time. We decided not to let the negativity of this hotel get us down. I will never go back there, and will never recommend it. We usually have good luck with La Quintas. This one needs to have it's franchise revoked. It brings down the La Quinta name.

None of the employees too friendly (not rude but not happy to help either)...the room was just okay ( i would say hampton inn a step up), the breakfast in the morning decent (but never enough tables...people standing waiting to sit all the time), extererior corridors. Pool area has NO lights at all (I can understand around the perimeter of it as it may bother pool front rooms, but none in the water either...pool area totally dark after dark. The pillow top beds were no better than anywhere else. When got up at night, and turned on the bathroom light there were several roaches scurrying around. We had 2 adults and 4 kids and we stayed in a \"city view\" family suite. We were doing a last minute trip with my sister and the kids and were trying to do it cheaply so we agreed on $109/night for parking lot view instead 169 for a beach front. We had family meet us there and they had a pool front family suite (which was nicer- more daylight). The housekeeping I swear chain smoked from early morning til after 1 hanging out all over the parking lot (our girl was very nice though). They don't tell you that they have pool towels, but if you go ask for them you can pick some up from the front desk. The pros were that it had a zero entry pool that was warm and a small hot tub. The beach is close in (you can drive on the beach there...so you have to watch kids running from the hotel property onto the beach-but cars are only going 10 mph)....right next to hotel property on the beach is a life guard, food truck that has burgers and hot dogs and snacks, and also the icecream truck passes thru a lot. But the sand is super soft, there are no rocks in the ocean and it is all sand to as far out as you would want to go, and the ocean gradually gets deep, no drop offs. The ocean in this area is very rough, we had a ball playing in it...diving in them, boogie boarding, etc. My cousin had a 5 year old who could handle them, and mine and my sisters were ages 8 thru 12 and this is their favorite beach so far. The pros on the hotel room were that it was tiled so that it wasn't wet and sandy carpet. Our A/c broke but was fixed the next morning (we realized it too late at night), and it was just a little north of the strip section, but it was a short drive to anywhere you would want to go. If you like wings, don't miss Houligans in Ormond beach, about a 15 minute drive. It had the best wings ever, and it was a sports bar/restaurant with lots of tvs and trivia machines that you can bring to the table and the kids and adults could entertain themselves with that.

My wife inserted the key into our room and it partially opened - stopped by the chain from the inside. A man, obviously shocked, yelled from the other side of the door which in turn startled my wife and I. We had to apologise for the interruption (even though this was not our mistake). My daughter and her husband opened the door to their room and it had not been made up! So, down to the desk I went and the clerk moved us to two new rooms (one of which was an upgrade to a suite). The next day we went sight seeing and when we returned to our room the card key would not work! I called the desk from our daughter's room and a new key was brought to us. Once in our room we noticed that the maid had been in and taken our used towels but didn't leave us any fresh ones. I called the desk yet again!!! New towels were brought to us. That night was probably the worst night ever spent in a hotel. Our \"special upgrade\" was beside the soda machine, ice machine, stairway and elevator!

However, after returning to the hotel with groceries after dinner we found there was NO PARKING. We were told by the night guard to park in the handicapped spot (still far away from our room) which we refused to do. We did park in an area in between the handicapped slots.The other nights we were forced to park across the street in a lot (unmarked) and dark and risk our lives running back across 4 lanes of traffic. When we complained the manager seemed less that concerned. Fighting for a breakfast table was another issue. We ended up standing or leaning just to eat. The worst thing is at 11:30pm we were seated on a couch in our room and proceeded to watch a mouse run back and forth across our floor. The night manager and security guard came and tried to find it, offered us another room,which we refused. We found that in the closet one of the ceiling tiles was crooked open and we think the mouse could have gotten in there,, or in gap in the bottom of the door. We packed up and left at 12:30 pm. We did get that night refunded. We had been there 3 days, no telling how many times the mouse crawled around us. I will never stay here again.

The breakfast was good the next morning(Hard boiled eggs, cereal, bagels ect), but lacked enough seating. I sat by the front desk and overheard two conversations from customers who were looking for rooms after checking into the two adjacent properties. Both said that they couldnt stay at those properties as the rooms were disgusting. One asked to see a room and booked a room imediately after seeing LaQuintas room. I filled out a survey on-line on my stay with LaQuinta and Today I got a call from the hotel manager, apoligizing for the watr pressure and ants and he assured me he had taken care of them through a exterminator and he also said they were replacing all the shower heads to help remedy the water presure.

The hotel is right on the beach, just a few blocks north of the main Daytona Beach area. There are about 80 rooms here, and about half have an ocean view, while the rest have a view of the parking lot. I didn't realize that at the time I booked (thru a big discount outfit where the only choice was a \"standard\" room) but I was able to get an ocean view room on check-in. The room was standard, but very clean and well maintained. Had a mini-fridge and micro,which was nice. Free breakfast is standard as well.....muffins, rolls, cereals, juice etc. Staff was quite helpful. They show free hi-speed internet on the web site, and they do have it, but it is not wi-fi. It is wired ethernet, and while cables are available at the front desk, they can be in short supply. The thing that was most unusual was the pool. It has a 10 ft mushroom in a corner in the shallow end. It is a plastic mushroom, and pool water is pumped up the stem and runs over and down the 6 ft cap, creating a 360 degree waterfall. The kids loved this waterfall effect, and as it was in the shallow end (depth 1 ft) , even the youngest could enjoy it. Looking at the car tags in the lot, there were many from out of state. And a lot of families with young kids. This is not a place that seems to attract what I would call the \"after spring break\" crowd.
