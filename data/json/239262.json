His friendly disposition and great sense of humor (\u201cBreakfast goes from 5am to 6am\u2026\u201d) went a long way to make us feel comfortable at the hotel and to feel like we were more than just guests. Our rooms were very clean, beds were comfortable, bathrooms had been updated with new fixtures (soap/shampoo supplied) and were spotless. Each room had a safe and a bar fridge. Unfortunately the fridge in our room didn\u2019t keep things very cool at all so we didn\u2019t use it much. Our room faced the courtyard below and was very quiet at night. Our traveling companions had a room facing the front street which they found to be a bit noisy in the daytime from the construction going on in the street below. The hotel was located in a safe neighborhood and we had no concerns about our safety when we were walking around at night. The hotel had good security \u2013 after 8pm and on weekends, the front entrance to the courtyard was locked. When the door was locked, there was a buzzer at the entrance to use to alert the staff at the desk and a camera for them to see who was requesting to be let in. The hotel was also in a great location to walk to many of the major attractions\u2026 5 min to the Spanish Steps, 15 min to the Vatican, 10 min to Trevi Fountain. We also walked to the Colosseum and Forum\u2026 20 min, I think. Shops, mostly high end, are located within 5 min. The grocery store across the street from the hotel was very handy and more affordable for buying water, soda and snacks. There is a restaurant located at the hotel as well as many others nearby. Breakfast was included with our rooms and consisted of a buffet with a variety of cereals, fruit, baked breads, quiche. There were also juices, fresh coffee and tea. Internet access was available in each room at a cost of 5 euros per 24 hours of use. This was especially useful on our last day at the hotel as we wanted to print our boarding passes for our flight home the next day. There was no printer in our room however Khaled advised us how to email the boarding pass info to the hotel\u2019s email address where he printed them out for all four of us and had them delivered to our rooms. And we had to be at the airport very early in the next morning, so Khaled called that evening and arranged for a taxi to pick us up in the morning.

We decided to book it anyways, figuring that we would only be in there at night. When we arrived I was so disappointed, there was no room to put suitcases, only enough room for one person to fit between the beds, the bathroom and shower were tiny and the floor was concrete. I felt as though we were in the basement of some dingy hotel.

We did have to pay for 2 full rooms, but it was worth the switch!
