I had read a lot of negative comments about the common size of Manhattan hotel rooms (SMALL!), but was pleasantly surprised when we opened the door. There certainly wasn't a lavish amount of extra space, but I was expecting to have to squeeze between the wall and the bed in order to get in and out of the bed. See the attached photo. Our room was a corner room on the east side of the 9th floor facing the street (#904). The king size bed was comfortable and the storage space in the chest and closet was more than adequate for the two of us. The in-room safe ($1/day) was a great convenience for protecting cash. The TV was a good size flat screen mounted on the wall and had HD capability. The list of available stations was more that adequate (who spends time in New York watching TV anyway? :) ). The bathroom was small, having room only for a tub/shower, commode and pedestal sink. You aren\u2019t going to spread out all your stuff in this one. The two strongest points for this property are the reasons I would gladly stay here again: 1) location, and 2) staff. The front door is half-block from Herald Square where one of the larger subway stations is located. Leaving the front door you turn left and can enter the subway before you come to the first intersection at 6th Ave. (Avenue of the Americas). Macy\u2019s is on the west side of Herald Square. The Empire State Building is about a block and half to the southwest (get there before 9:30 and you probably won\u2019t have to wait in much of a line; buy your tickets ahead of time online to reduce your waiting even more). Bryant Park, the New York Public Library, Times Square, Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden and Penn Station are all within easy walking distance. We did not have much occasion to interact with hotel staff members but when we did they were friendly and helpful. I was glad to see that they did not have bell hops waiting to take our bags and our money. We had to check out a number of hours before we needed to head to the airport and they gladly held our luggage in a locked closet until we were ready to leave. The power went off in our room one morning when we were getting ready. I called the front desk and it was back on in no more than 5 minutes. We encountered 2 minor annoyances. I shower in the evening and my wife showers in the morning. I never had this problem but she had a very hard time regulating the water for a constant temperature. We wondered if this was due to a larger number of people showering in the morning than in the evening. The breakfast area is the most disappointing. It does not handle a large crowd well. There\u2019s plenty of seating as far as I can tell but the line at the toasters can be very long if you don\u2019t arrive before 8:00. The food available was adequate but not memorable: instant oatmeal, cold serial, donuts, boiled eggs, oranges, apples, bagels, toast, orange juice, apple juince and coffee. You certainly won\u2019t leave hungry, but you won\u2019t be delighted either. There is no read-to-cook waffle batter. It\u2019s just as well. You\u2019d probably be in line for 20-30 minutes during the peak morning rush. I have a non-hotel tip for you. There were 5 of us traveling together. That\u2019s not a very cab-friendly number.

The decor and the bathroom were a bit antiquated, and so much unnecessary furniture was crammed into the room that it made the room smaller. The windows and the gauze hadn't been cleaned in I don't know how long, which made the already dark room darker, and the radiator would randomly come on and off making the room hotter than I wanted. The elevator was also extremely slow and small so when it was full you had to wait an extra long time...or use the stairs, which is what I usually just did anyway. The breakfast that comes in the package is not great - don't expect wonders! Bagels, Waffles, bread, pre-peeled boiled eggs on paper plates and juice in plastic cups. The staff were mostly oblivious to your presence. Can't say they were unfriendly, but they certainly didn't go out of their way to make you feel welcome, which was disappointing considering the mostly friendly staff I had experienced in the other hotels I stayed in.

Everything was within walking distance of this awesome little hotel. Sure its noisy and the bathrooms are small, but hey, when you're in New York, who in the heck has time to stay in the room! Upon our arrival to the airport, there was a gentleman who seemed a little shady asking in a low tone if we needed a ride to the city in his limo. We met a friend on the way in on our flight, and we decided to take him up on the offer. It turned out to be a great deal! 65.00 into the city in a limo. You cant beat that. These guys are just trying to make a living, so you can't blame them for hustling a little bit. Anyway, after seeing some of these cab drivers while I was there, I am glad my money went to the limo driver. The concierge/door person at the hotel (bad of me not to get his name!!) was extremely friendly and helpful. I even observed him giving a foot massage to a guest on the second night of our stay. Talk about hospitality! Ms. Franklin, the reservationist at the hotel was also very helpful with our accommodations. She was the icing on the cake making sure my wife and I had a nice 35th St view.

Room quite spacious - decked out in very dated furniture but quirky - we had a window that looked out onto a wall so no natural light but as we were out most of the time it was not an issue. Plenty of room to store suitcases etc. Our room was very quiet with little street noise. We went to breakfast once but didnt stay as did not suit us - limited appeal and choice. We did however go right out of hotel to end of street and crossed road to the Oxford Cafe on 5th Ave next to pret a manger - 1 minute walk. Daughter had 3 huge fresh panckes with maple syrup for just over 3 dollars which we shared and hubby had egg, bcaon, sausage roll - fresh orange juice, coffee and hot chocolate all for 18 dollars. We went to the bar next (Brendans) to hotel for evening drinks after our days out and you can access hotel through interconnecting door. Nice atmosphere - paid 8 dollars for red wine ; 7 dollars for pint guiness. We ate there once and had a nice meal and you get 15% discount. You have to book out at noon but if your flight is later they will keep suitcases in a locked room in foyer which was helpful as we didnt need to leave for JFK til 230 pm. We walked everywhere in NY - i lost half a stone ! You see so much more by doing this and all within reasonable distance. We booked this hotel as so cheap compared to others - but if we returned to NY, which is unlikely, we would try elsewhere. For those of you looking at this re booking through Virgin - we booked flights separately with Virgin and hotel through bookings.com for total of \u00a32300 instead of the \u00a33600 Virgin wanted for a package.

The room itself was clean and spacious, with a lovely warmth as well. It had a real art deco theme with warm colors and light. The bed was comfy, and the bathroom was great, with a shower and bath. We came home every night, after a long day, with our room and bed clean and fresh. The hotel itself is only a few short steps away from the nearest subway station, which from there, can get you anywhere in the city in only a few minutes, and we were only a 10 minute walk to Times Square, or beautiful Bryant Park.

The free breakfast every morning was a great way to start the day, with everything you could want, when you're in a busy city.

Personally I would prefer to slightly further away from the centre but the noise was not an issue once in the hotel. I would echo a previous review - Rooms aren't great and shower was awful. Temperature fluctuated all the time. We had booked 2 non-smoking rooms but clearly someone had been smoking heavily in one of them. The staff were not particularly friendly on arrival but more so on departure. Think this was in order to ensure a tip. Spoilt somewhat by the fact that when our limo (organised through Virgin) didn't turn up on time, whilst the bell man was helpful, he and the limo driver nearly ended up fighting while my husband loaded our bags! This was our last memory of NYC and the Comfort Inn.

However, the actual neighborhood surrounding the hotel surprised me a little, because just a few blocks over is a much cleaner and nicer area. Since we had small children with us, we probably would have chosen a little differently, had we known. I did not mind the age of the hotel - it's a little older but not gross. I also didn't mind the size of our room - with 3 adults, a preschooler, and a crib, we fit fine and did not feel cramped. However, I read over and over how \"clean\" other reviewers found the hotel to be. We did not have that same experience. When I pulled back the top blankets on both beds, there were long black hairs on the bed, and we also found several in the bathroom. I thought perhaps those had come from the cleaning person, but we passed her in the hall, and her hair was quite the opposite!

We took a room on the 2nd floor as it was the only one available for our very early check in, and we were happy enough there to stay the whole 6 nights. The rooms are small but the bed was big and conformable. The windows were rather dirty on the outside and, being surrounded by tall buildings, our 2nd floor room didn\u2019t get much light or fresh air, but I wasn\u2019t exactly planning on spending my days in my hotel room. The building is really old (antique mail shoot old) so the place has a bit of character (like the ancient elevator) and the halls are a bit musty and in need of refurbishment, but the rooms are clean and nicely decorated with dark wood furnishings, cheery yellow striped wallpaper and flat screen tvs. Bathrooms are predictably pokey but still functional. We hardly heard our neighbours, but had a bit of noise from the street outside as there was construction going on. With the air conditioner on it didn\u2019t bother us. The location of this hotel is right in the middle of the touristy mid town area \u2013 which is good for getting around \u2013 the Empire State building and Macys are practically next door. The herald square subway station is at the end of the block and it has major connections to just about everywhere. There are 2 Duane Reed\u2019s (drug/convenience store) within a block\u2019s walk which are good for drinks & snacks. We didn\u2019t try the hotel\u2019s restaurant but it was always buzzing. We did try the Korean BBQ place across the road which was pretty good, but a bit pricey. We also tried the Chinese place across the street which was decent and very cheap . There is also a slice away, hot dog place, Starbucks, Subway and Chipolates (good mexican) all within a block\u2019s walk if you don\u2019t want to go far for a quick and inexpensive bite. Breakfast was mostly over processed carbs \u2013 bagels, sliced bread, wafflels, donuts, cereal, muffins and some boiled eggs, cream cheese, jam etc. The coffee and orange juice however were good. Breakfast is irritatingly served on plastic plates with plastic cutlery (despite this being a proper restaurant at night?) \u2013 but that seems to be the breakfast norm in most chain places we stayed in the US.

Certainly this hotel's location is excellent, just a few minutes from the Empire State and a few minutes more to Time Square - all easily navigated on foot. As an 'affordable' hotel the question is less whether it delivers quality, but rather whether it represents value for money on it's own terms. On this criteria the results are mixed. There's no coffee making facilities in rooms, but this isn't uncommon for New York and free tea and coffee is available in reception throughout. Likewise the inclusion of breakfast is a nice touch, with a fairly reasonable range of cereals, fruits, toast and cakes. However... the hotel feels small, to the point of claustrophobia. Rooms themselves are clean but small. The stairs are steep to say the least and a 10 flight climb is likely to test the average Joe. Two small lifts serve the many floors, struggling to cope with demand at the best of times - let alone like during our stay when one failed and remained unprepared for the rest of the week. These aren't luxuries, these are the basics. Likewise paper plates and plastic cutlery for breakfast remove any sense of class from the establishment (whilst doubtless keeping costs, and therefore prices, down) and we found the reception service to be fairly slow and helpful as the exception rather than the norm. Given it's location and price the Comfort Inn may be worth a look.

The pros outweighed the cons such as :free daily breakfast just like it's pictured on their website: coffee, juices, cereals ( 3 kinds) donughts, bagels, sliced bread to toast, boiled eggs and waffle. The area was kept clean and filled continuously by their hard working staff. Free internet and daily newspapers. We stayed on the 12th floor facing the front without a view to speak of.

The lobby was clean and cool with AC and had several couches to sit at , enjoy complimentary coffee all day, free daily newspapers and pc use. The staff was very friendly and courteous at all times and responded lighting fast to my request of a new shower curtain since the one there had a musty smell and within minutes they were there to replace it and that took care of the funky smell. The airconditioner ran continually which I loved since usually the click on and off of most wake me up easily.

There is a subway station at the end of the street so can always catch the subway. The free breakfast was just what you needed to start the day, pretty basic but more on offer if wanted to purchase. We travelled with Virgin and with the rep meeting, you got a choice of 4 cooked breakfasts which was also a nice treat. We all did mostly tourist sites, empire state, rockerfeller centre, Ellis island, Brooklyn bridge, Statue of Liberty etc and tried to walk everywhere. The greyline buses are a good alternative though and many of our friends have used. Be careful when booking trips with Virgin, we were sold empire state tickets which when we were asked he confirmed they were the same price as purchasing there and would assist with the queuing but this was not the case! They were $2 eachmore expensive and we still had to do exactly the same queuing and change the voucher into a ticket! Room was spacious, as we had read the rooms were all small in NY. Comfy bed, flatscreen TV, safe etc. Free tea and coffee in reception, and also free internet in 15 mins slots which was just enough to check emails etc. irish bar across the road was good for beer and food. Check for happy hour times and also bargain if the guy is out front, we managed to get a 20% voucher! Overall, would definately recommend this hotel and if we went back to NY, would stay here.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex, UK", "Title": "\u201cFabulous location - made the weekend!\u201d", "Author": "dante35", "ReviewID": "UR106639774", "Content": "This hotel was brilliant.

Free internet and printer was great to get our return boarding passes. But without a doubt the location makes this hotel 5* in my book. A five minute walk to the Empire State building (which was great as we went overboard in the giftshop so could drop them off afterwards!). Macy's was even closer and is open until 9.30pm every night. Times Square was 10 minutes away as was Grand Central Terminal. The subway was at the end of the street and 5th and 6th Avenue either end.

The bathroom was tiny but the room made it for that! On the first morning of breakfast you get greated by Virgin rep and served a lovely breakfast. The mornings after you have the complimentary breakfast which is great in the mornings as it saves having to find somewhere to eat. The breakfast consists of bagels, toast, dougnuts, cereal, coffee ,juice etc. Be early to avoid to avoid it from being busy! Their is a great choice of room service food which come from the cafe next door. we found this to be a bonus especially after all the sightseeing. Their hot choc is yummy. The hotel is situated next to a cafe and a Brendans bar/grill which both serve nice snacks and food which we found to be pleasant and near (after all the walking during the day) plus you get 15% off at brendans bar/grill if you stay at hotel. Hotel is situated on a quietish street up from Macy's and from Empire estate which is approx 2-3 min walk!!! We didn't find it to be too noisy at night at the hotel due to it being on a quietish side street!!! In the hotel lobby you get complimentary free coffee and tea all day long due to having no drink facility in your room. One thing i would mention is the hotel taxi service to be pricy, it ended up costing us about $81 dollars from hotel to JFK airport on way bk!! On the way going to hotel from JFK a yellow taxi cost us about $45 dollars.... so it might be worthwhile flagging down a yellow cab!!!

And if it's busy, there's always the computers you can go and use (for free) whilst you wait for a table. The bed was comfy, which is what you need after a busy day in the hustle and bustle.

I'm 5ft 4 and would need hubby to bump me up onto the bed on some occasions as I simply couldn't get on ... mainly because I was suffering with my back from all the walking.

However, the room was clean and very neat with a large flat screen TV, and we could pick up the free wi-fi easily from the room. The bathroom however was a different story. Room 911 had obviously not been used in a while as when the bath/shower tap was first switched on a lot of black stuff was coming out along with bright yellow water. The bath was filling slowly and it turned out the plug wasn't draining properly either... The following evening before we were going out, upon flushing the toilet the water was rising and rising and leaked over into the floor before we turned off our water and reported it to the reception staff. They said they would send somebody right away, however when we arrived back to the room very late that night they said unfortunately it could not be fixed that day and would be sorted first thing in the morning. So the next morning, we went out for the day and reminded the staff of our problem. Still not fixed by the time we got back to the room to get ready for our evening out. Finally, we returned home around 10pm and the toilet had been fixed. I am sure the hotel staff are very busy, however, I think more than 24 hours to fix a toilet is slightly ridiculous. We thought the breakfast was OK. For a hotel in Manhattan, I believe it is rare to offer breakfast at all, and saved us alot of money. We did eat out a couple of days but found the hotel breakfast fine for what we needed it for. The location of the hotel was just brilliant.

They didn't even asks any question or say anything to make you feel welcome just the formal things like check out is 2pm and breakfast is at 8-10pm. So we headed into our room. The lift is so tiny that it's a bit tricky if you have a big luggage. The floors on the hall are all creaky and door noisy like the hotel was built during the First World War. We are on the 10th Floor and the door on our room won't even shut properly so at night a bit of light from the hall is seeping thru our door. Comes into our room it's tiny, dusty and dated. Bathroom was digusting not even got any heating on it so get quite cold when showering. It got two tap one for cold and one for hot so you've got to be good at mixing the water to get the right temperature. Shower is the same its not even electric shower. So you are showering and suddenly water gone either hot or cold. In the room the heating/airconditioned is behind the curtain \"How stupid is that\"? So can't close the curtain at night and in the morning u can't even open the curtain wide because the next building is an office so you will exposed yourself plus windows are quite smuggy,dusty and dirty.

We went to Woodbury Shopping Outlet (about an hour away by Bus) definately a must for the serious shoppers and also did the obligatory sight seeing bus trips downtown and uptown but never had time to go the Bronx.

Whilst there we had a Few problems, when we entered our room it stunk of stale cigarette smoke so we aired it by opening a window. We are both non smokers and hate the smell of it so this was highly unpleasant, after having the window open for a while however the smell cleared. The room was large and clean and u could request clean linen when u wanted it. Rooms and beds were clean daily and the maids did a good job so we tipped them well. On the morning after our first nights sleep we found the toiled had been blocked. How this had happen I don't know. We told the front desk when we went out that morning and by the time we returned it was fixed. At the time we mentioned the toilet we also complained that the tv signal was rubbish and also that throughout the night the radiator was making really loud hissing so could they please fix that as it woke us up on many occasions throughout the night. Sadly these two issues weren't resolved during our stay. Another grumble is the water temperature of the shower and the hand basin. It was either red hot or cold u couldn't get a good mix on the temperature at all. On the plus side the staff were friendly and always available at the front desk. The included breakfast was good enough to start off the day with and there was always enough choice of bagels, bread, cereal fruit and doughnuts and there was always a seat spare to sit down. There was also free wi Fi which was strongest when in the lobby and they also had a Pc and printer which was free to use for 15 minutes per guest at a time. This was a great help when we wanted to check in on line for our returning flight and print off our boarding passes. All in all I would say that this hotel is in a great location with good staff. Personally we wouldn't stay here again though as we preferred the hotel Metro which is across the road and was in the same cost bracket ( we stayed there 2 years ago) If you would like any more info about our stay please PM me.

It's located very near Herald Street subway station (on 34th street) and is handy for shopping at Macy's, walking to Times Square or strolling into Tribeca. Our room was spacious and tidy, and had a great view of the Empire State Building. It was also rather hot, though the maintenance man kindly turned off our radiator, which made sleeping much more comfortable. There's free wifi in the room, though we often found it difficult to get a good connection (using iPad and iPhones), but we had no such problem in the lobby. Our shower was tricky to use, as the mixer taps couldn't get 'warm', so we were either freezing or very hot! The toilet was also very close to the bath, so not so comfortable. However, the bathroom was roomy and there were toiletries if we wanted them. Towels were abundant! A 'not so obvious' charge for the room safe is a dollar a day. The bed, though soft and comfortable, was a little too soft and comfortable! Was it a water bed? It seemed to 'ripple'! Breakfast at the adjoining restaurant is good, with bagels, doughnuts, waffles, toast, coffee, two cereals and a basket of fruit available. Virgin Holidaymakers can also sample the 'menu breakfast', which would normally cost between $10-20, for free. However, Manhattan is great for unique breakfast experiences, so get up early and start searching! The staff at reception are more appropriate for a 2-star, as they seem to argue with one another, and sometimes watch TV (one guy got rather excited about the Extreme Fighting that was on, which we didn't think was suitable). They're also polite when they choose to be, and they were quick to sort our radiator problem.

I think it is important to remiind people that this is a 2/3 star hotel, so in effect, you get what you pay for. However, this hotel provides a higher class of stay than you'd expect of a 2/3 star place. The biggest positive of this hotel is the location. Perfectly situated in mid town. 10 mins walk to Flat Iron building, Times Square. 15 mins to Rockerfeller centre. Subway stop at the end of this street. It has to be said that some of the reception staff have typical NY attitudes, but I wouldn't say they are rude, they're just NY hotel staff and that means they don't have much time for anybody!!! Don't be offended and move on. Rooms are fine. Clean and considering it's a small hotel, quite big. I would recommend getting a double double room even if you are a couple. You get seperate beds but the rooms are much bigger. Now lets talk breakfast! For me this is a HUGE plus. OK, it's not all caviar and gold plates but it does the job. Fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bagels, DOUGHNUTS (only in America!) , tea coffee, fruit, toast. This is what to expect and given that breakfast at Lindy's or any other chain of restaurant will set you back $20 a visit it saves you the cash to spend on something better (like Knicks tickets!). The hotel also has a wonderful restaurant. We ate here twice during a 5 night stay and it was fantastic. You'll forget you're eating in you hotel. The food is very very good, especially the steak. The only downside to this hotel is the noise you might experience from the street if you have a room near ground level. Yes this is irritating, but you have to remember you are in the heart of New York's is town district.....it's never quiet. If you have an active holiday (and you should have given you are in NY), you'll only notice it on night one...after that you'll be so tired you could sleep through anything! I think it's important to set your expectations about this hotel. If you want a bloke at the front door opening it for you every time you walk in whilst greeting you with a smile and a good morning, then you'll be dissapointed. If you want a place that is accessible to the the subway and within 15 mins walking distance of NYC's top 10 attractions then this is for you. PLEASE don't be put off by the negative reviews written by people who expect a 2/3 star hotel to rival the Plaza. These people are fools who love to be negative at any given oppportunity. They want the experience of a 4 start hotel but are not willing to part with the cash! Take from someone who has experienced 4 different NY hotels on 5 different occaisons, this hotel offers convieince at an affordable price. If like me you couldn't afford to stay at a 5 str hotel in NY, then you can rest assured that you can stay here and still have a 5 star holiday. A little tip for anyone going to NY. Eat at JUNIORS!

Our flight was 7.40 pm and we left the hotel at 3 pm, it was a Sunday afternoon but the traffic was terrible it took an hour to get to the terminal. Checking in with Continental was a very long job they were very disorganised it took 1 hour 30 minutes to check in and get through security. TOP TIP - leave at least 4 hours from hotel to flight.

All that was to change. From checking in, the staff were really helpful. The lifts were a little slow but the hotel is older so I expected this and it didnt cause a problem at all. On getting to our room I couldnt believe how lovely it was. Really clean, comfy beds, large TV which my son couldnt wait to switch on, and plenty of room to put clothes, suitcases etc in a walk in closet. I liked the fact that the room had its own safe deposit box. The room was quite dark, it did have several lamps but admittedly the light wasnt great, but then I didnt come to New York just for a well lit room. On opening the curtains I was rewarded with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building - what more could you ask for. The hotel is central for everything, everything right on your doorstep, underground station more or less right outside the door. Brendans cafe is lovely, right next door. Macys literally over the road. Just a brilliant base to get around everywhere. Times Square is literally a 10 minute walk away and probably about a 20 minute walk to the stores on 5th Avenue - just brilliant. Breakfast consisted of waffles and donuts, toast and cereal and an abundance of coffee and juice. It was enough for first thing in the morning. Theres a great selection on the room service menu too.

If you are someone who wants donuts and pastries you need to get there before 9am though or they run out. It was always busy at breakfast and seating could be difficult to find. My only complaints would be about the narrow hallways and the elevators. The hallways are very narrow and when the maid cart is out it is very difficult to squeeze by the cart to get through to your room. The elevators are very tight so during busy times there is a long wait for an elevator. I would recommend requesting a room on a lower level.

We had two rooms one for myself and my partner in our 20's and another for my parents who are in their 50's. Transfer from JFK took around 45 minutes and cost around 60 dollars including tips and tolls in a yellow cab from outside the airport. The enterance to the hotel is bright and welcoming with a place to get free hot drinks from in the foyer. The staff on reception informed us we had two smoking rooms. We all all non-smokers but unfortunatly they could only change one of the rooms so my partner and I stuck with the smoking room. On entering the room I was very pleased we didn't swap as we had a fantastic view of the empire state building! Our room was room 708. My parents room had a slightly less interesting view from room 610 of a wall and drain pipe! We found the rooms to be more than adequate for what we wanted, a base for a full on site seeing holiday. The only drawback I found of our room was the bathroom. The toilet was really close to the bath so made it hard to sit on! The bed was comfy and the flat screen tv was good in the room. The room did smell of smoke at first but I guess this is what you expect from a smoking room. It is an old building and I did not like the stairs, they were quite tight and small, the elevators are a much better option but at peak times such as breakfast you had to wait quite a while for one. The rooms were very warm which was a good thing as it was minus 5 outside and snowing! Also we had no problem with hot water for baths and showers. We didnt notice much noise from outside at all. Nowhere near what we expected. Maybe this was becasue we were high up? Also other guests were quiet and we heard very little noise at all from our room. Breakfast was an added bonus for us as we did'nt even realise it was included at the time of booking. It was fine, there was toast, eggs, doughnuts, bagels and cereal to choose from. Also hot drinks and orange and apple juice. We also likes the free wifi and the computer in the enterance that you could use for free and print out your bording passes to check in online which was great and meant we could choose our seats for the way back. For dinner for three of our nights we went to 'O' Reileys' irish bar over the road. You got a 10 percent discount from being from the hotel if you told them. The bar downstairs was always very busy but we went upstairs to the restaurant and thought it was great with a nice atmosphere and good attentive staff. We didnt try the hotels restaurant 'Brendans' but it looked nice. Check out was at 12 and our flight was not until 9pm so we left the five bags with the reception. We tipped the man 5 dollars although he didnt seem to be expecting this at all and was grateful. Incedently this was the only time we tipped inside the hotel. The reception booked our taxi and then helped us to put the bags in when it arrived. Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and would definatley stay there again.

We only stayed in the room to sleep, so this was no real problem. The room was well appointed and had been recently decorated, it wasn\u2019t the cleanest room I have stayed in, but the cleaner did come daily. The continental breakfast provided was good with bagels, waffles, toast, cereal, cakes, hot and cold drinks and others all provided. We usually went down about 09.30 in the morning, it was usually quite busy, getting a seat and table wasn't a real problem. We didn't eat in at Brendan's due to the number of other food outlets nearby. Out and about, we used the 48 hour hop on / off Grayline bus tour ticket to get about and see New York. We did the uptown, downtown and night tours which were all good, at worst some guides were mediocre, however some are very good, keeping the topics interesting. We never had a real problem getting on the top level of the bus. Times Square was good, always bustling with people and plenty shops and restaurants to choose from. The Empire States building is just around the corner from the hotel and Macy\u2019s is only a block away. If you are travelling on a budget and planning a busy time in Manhattan for a few nights this hotel would do. If your expectations are high I would give it a miss. There is nothing greatly wrong with this hotel, however it didn\u2019t give me the feeling that I would use it again if returning to New York.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "sheilagriffiths18", "ReviewID": "UR47489221", "Content": "We stayed for six nights and found the Hotel to be very good.

However, there are plenty of lovely places to eat close by - in fact, there are a few restaurants directly opposite the hotel entrance which served excellent food. The location of this hotel is excellent - you're literally around the corner from the Empire State Building, Macys and 5th Avenue, and it's about a 10-minute walk to Times Square. Whether you decide to stay at this hotel or another in Manhattan, it would be well worth your while purchasing a New York Pass (go to www.newyorkpass.com for full details). So long as you use as many of the offers in it as possible, it's money well-spent. It includes free entry to Madame Tussaud's, museums (and MUCH more) and discounts off sightseeing tours, which are unmissable if you haven't been to New York before. It would also be worth your while buying a weekly bus ticket, which can be purchased from the underground/subway self-service machines, as it will save you a lot of money. Try to only use the yellow taxis if you're going to use one at all - there are black ones as well which are more expensive. All the taxis will charge the same for transferring to/from the airport - at the time we travelled it was $45. If you're going to the Statue of Liberty and want to walk up to the top (inside of course!), you have to pre-book this a day in advance.

We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant once and you had to eat from a paper plate with a plastic knife and fork! Yet during the day in the same place they serve delicious food and and drinks with great service.. couldnt work this one out! The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpfull. But is is one of those hotels that your sat on the coach waiting to be dropped at your hotel and think 'ooh hope thats not mine' and it is! I highly recommend a full helicopter trip!

There was a bit of construction/renovation noise to deal with but we were up early every day so that didn't really affect our visit. My only disappointment was with the breakfast buffet, which featured mostly starchy 'white food' like bread, muffins, toaster waffles, baked (not boiled) bagels, boiled eggs and 2 types of cereal. The only fruit was whole oranges and apples. This became tedious after a week and we found ourselves hunting for other varieties of fruit & cereals for breakfast.

Smack bang in the middle of the city - a gateway to everything. Empire State Building literally around the corner and subway entrance at end of street taking you to all destinations. I recommend getting a 7 day Metro Card - $25 for limitless subway and bus rides - well worth it. Breakfast was delicious - Bagels, cereals, waffles, toast, donuts, muffins, tea, coffee, juice and much more! Internet and printer available in reception which is handy for checking in for flights online etc. .Staff were very helpful, helped to book lots of trips- i would advise doing everything through them or at least seek their advice as there are a lot of touts and companies who sell fake tickets or give misguided info to sell you a product. Bar staff at Brendans, which is the bar attached to the hotel were brilliant - the drinks are very reasonable and the Cosmopolitans are really nice. They look after you and we had a free round of drinks for our custom. Also the bar food was to die for - MUST TRY. We had 3 in a room and two double beds in it. The beds were so comortable we wanted to take them home. Good size rooms and bathrooms and great closet space. The rooms were spotless - fully hoovered, towels changed and everything changed daily. We had a newly re-furbished room and was very well done. Some rooms are still being done out but will all be completed soon. If you are going soon the 4th Floor is already done out so you may want to request a room on that floor for now. The street the hotel is on has plenty of amenities, three Irish bars, fast food joints, Cocktail Lounge called Catwalk and various Souvenir shops. I recommend Digital Express dead opposite the hotel as the owners Charles and George are very helpful and will offer some discounts. There were 10 of us and we received way over $100 discount between us on all the souvenirs and memorabilia you could hope for. My only warning to anyone (not about the hotel) but about a tour Guide Company called Grayline. They do Hop on, Hop Off buses around the city. They offered us a package of hop on, hop off buses for 2 days which was fab, but also an express pass to Empire State and boat tour to, and to get off and see Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. PLEASE BE AWARE their New York Water Taxi (small yellow boat) DOES NOT, I REPEAT DOES NOT stop off at the islands it just sails around. The only way to get to the islands is to go to battery park and use liberty cruises - the official company and pay $12.00 for a ticket which is very cheap. Also the Empire State part was not worth it because although it has a queue jump, if you get there early enough there is no queue anyway. So after paying $73 each we only used the bus, payed extra for an express Empire State pass we did not need and had to shell out another $12.00 for another Statue of Liberty Ticket. Apart from that we had the most amazing time - its the best city in the world in my opinion and the Hotel was certainly a big part of that experience.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cBedbug alarm!!!\u201d", "Author": "Magazine_girlOslo", "ReviewID": "UR25987215", "Content": "OK hotel - nice location - but after my first night I found bedbugs in my bed!!!!!

Our room was on the 11th Floor and was much larger than I expected, having been previously warned that hotel rooms in New York are small. Although we had a large bay window and another large window to the side the room felt dark due to the window dressings. Sadly, we didn't have much of a view but we were not expecting much of a view in a busy city centre. The bathroom was small but it served it's purpose. The complimentary toiletries are not worth having, teeny-weeny bottles! On the plus side there was an abundance of fluffly white towels - much more than needed. There were two three quarter beds in our room, which were high from the ground and a bit of a tight squeeze for two! The room was also pleasantly decorated. The Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Our electricity went off one morning, it was restored quickly and efficiently. The best thing about this hotel has to be it's location. The Empire State Building is just around the corner to the left and Macy's at the end of the block to the right. There are a couple of Irish Pubs over the road and a lovely micro brewery/pub at the base of the Empire State Building. We managed to navigate pretty well on foot, the street/avenue grid is easy to get your mind around once you know how. As well as the Empire State Bulding and Macy's, Times Square, 5th Avenue and Grand Central Station are all within walking distance. We bought a hop-on, hop-off two day bus ticket to see the sights and get our bearings. We did the Downtown Tour and the Brooklyn Loop as we more or less did the uptown tour ourselves by foot. We hopped off the Downtown Tour at Ground Zero and walked to Battery Park to catch the Free Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue of Liberty. We had a great view of her from the River and ferry then swapped ferries to come straight back. Overall, we did not like the food we ate, we stuck to the chains like Planet Hollywood and TGI Fridays but found the food was greasy and served cold. We would go to the little off main street diners next time, there are lots and lots to choose from. Highlights of our trip has to be the Empire State Building, the views are amazing, the Statue of Liberty, Macy's. Tiffany's, Central Park in the snow and buzzing atmosphere of Times Square. As for the Comfort Inn, Manhattan I would only choose to stay there again if the budget was tight. I felt it was ok, but just ok - not quite a three star, but certainly more than a one star as the site suggests. The common areas looked grubby, the lift was tiny as was the Reception.

I explained it had been on as high as it would go since we got there and the room was still very uncomfortable. Then they said they would turn off the boiler which I guess they did becuase it started cooling off. Why wouldn't they have it where you could turn it off in the room?

However, the only sign we saw of this were workmen loading the lift in the evening, it certainly caused us no bother. The hotel also booked our transport back to Newark. This turned out to be a Limo and saved us just over $10 on the price of a Taxi. Not much, but definately a more comfortable ride.

The room had a good sized Queen bed, table and chairs, large chest of drawers and a cupboard/wardrobe, complete with coat hangars, iron and board and keycode safe. So there was no tripping over the suitcases! The room also had an air conditioning/heating unit, but we did not need to use it during our stay.

There was also some works being undertaken on a demolished building right behind the Hotel, as a result there was no need for an alarm clock as they started work at 7am sharp!

No tea making facilities, so you may like to take a travel kettle for your early morning cuppa (European adaptor does not work in USA so you may have to buy a different one whilst there). Free tea and coffee in the reception, but 11 floors down in my nightie does not appeal!!! The breakfast was not very nice - same every day, bagels, waffles, cakes and toast. Filling but stodgy. Free internet access in reception - but only one computer, so there was always a queue for it no matter what time of day or evening. Taxi fare from JFK is a fixed 45 dollars, plus 5 dollars road toll, in a yellow cab. Same on return - although the receptionist said that we should take the firm they recommend (100 dollars or thereabouts!) as there was not a fixed fee for return journey. Not true. Taxi rank just by Macey's store,a two minute walk from the hotel. Hotel was fine for the price - however the weather was really wet on a couple of days we were there, and it would have been nice had there been a large reception/sitting area, instead of having to go to the room. Only a small lobby/reception at this hotel. Bathroom o.k., but no shelves to put things on, so toiletries had to go on floor.

The hotel is in a safe location, side street runnung between 5th & 6th Avenues.Rooms are fine, it is an old hotel & so some people on this site seem to knock it for not being as spotless as you would expect a more modern hotel to be. We have always found our rooms to be clean & well kept, fresh towells each day & a nice warm, safe environment. I wouldn't take my kids there if it wasn't good. The hotel has two small lifts so at times you may have to wait a few moments but no real problems there. The hotel offers a free continental breakfast each morning which is served in Brendans bar, it has a wide selection of cakes, pastries, cereals, juices, tea/coffee & also some fresh fruit. We love it & it sets ypu up nicely for the day ahead. The hotel staff are friendly, if you have not been to NYC before you may find them a little abrupt, you will get used to the fact that New Yorkers are like that as its a busy city & everything moves quickly. We have got to know the staff very well & if you treat them nicely then they will treat you nicely. Brian who is the senior reception guy is absolutely great, if you need information on anything then you just ask him & he;ll help.

Our floor had a dip as you got into the room or right before you step into the bathroom but this could not possibly ruin my holiday. I cannot say enough about the staff. They are very accommodating and kind. My friend may feel differently, though, as he tried calling and complaining about a noisy room next door and (his words) was greeted with indifference after two calls down to the front desk.

The hotel is very close to Penn Station , only a 2 block walk. We arrived around 11am and were pleasantly surprised that we could check right in. We were given room 1207 which had a double and twin bed, so the room was a little bit larger than others. We actually had a pretty good veiw of the Empire State Building. At night it looked really neat. After reading other reviews of this hotel I expected a smaller room. It had an overside closet with a luggage rack and the bathroom was good size. The bathroom was clean but the border of wallpaper was peeling off due to no ventilation of the shower steam. It was stocked with shampoo, conditioner, soaps and shoe polish. Also pleanty of towels. After partialy unpacking we headed out to explore. The front desk staff was ver friendly and gave us maps and directions for the subway lines. We took the subway form Penn to Fulton St. to see So Street Seaport. We walked around a bit , took pictures of the Brooklyn Bridge and then ate a wonderful lunch at a restaurant called Red. We had an upstairs table and the window faced the water. The food and the prices were very good. It was a mexican restaurant and the portions were huge. After only having a snack for breakfast, we still did not complete our meals. After lunch we headed toward Chinatown to shop. We got a little off track and a very friendly local turned us the right way. We found Mott street and headed north. Bought a few reasonable pocketbooks and a couple of posters painted with names for presents. Mott Street then turns into Little Italy. I wish I hadn't eaten so much for lunch..The canollis looked wonderful. There was actually a line out in the street to buy them. By the time we got to NOHO we started looking for a cab. Which wasn't easy around 4:30pm. We ended up getting picked up and headed back to the hotel. Our cab driver was very friendly . Then out again and walked up to Times Square. After being in the southern part of the city all afternoon, it was sooo crowded. But we were in the city. Our play \"The Grinch\" was cancelled due to the stagehand strike so we decided to go see a movie. Our movie was showing on the 4th floor, the restroom was on the 3rd and concessions were on the 2nd. very confusing if you follow the crowds up the escalator and miss those things. After the movie we grabbed a slice of pizza on the way to hotel and crashed. The next day we went down to breakfast. It was very well equipped with coffee, juices, bagels, donuts, muffins, toast and eggs. The hotel held our bags for us in a locked room and gave us tickets. We ended up going to the American Museum of Natural History for a few hours, walked through Central Park then to FAO Schwartz (which was insanely busy and hot) then took a cab back to the hotel to get our luggage. Again it was very convienent to Penn station and walked over to the train station.

The rooms are quite small and so are the bathrooms, but it's nothing unusual in NYC, and they are clean albeit somewhat old. Same goes for the elevators.

The hotel is attached to Brendan's Bar and your room key card entitles you to 15% off food there...the few times we ate there it was surprisingly nice! Nice Irish bar staff but a strange lay-out. The bar seems to attract 'suit' types in the evening. There is a free 'Continental' breakfast served in Brendan's bar which is dreadful...it is worse than hostel food. It is buffet style and the one morning we did try it the place was dirty and everything was served on paper plates with paper cutlery even though this is a proper restaurant. Also the guys 'looking' after the breakfast area couldn't get people out fast enough. I would avoid it. There is a little cafe on the other side of the hotel and they have lovely breakfast for a few bucks. We stayed here as someone recommended the Comfort Inn but I have since discovered there are 2! The one they meant was the Comfort Inn Midtown which I happened to pass and it looked much nicer and has recently been renovated.

Our suggestions for improvement for the hotel would be: * There needs to be a space for groups to meet. This was a real problem for our group, because we either had to meet in the small reception area, or at one end of the restaurant, among other diners. This meant that we never could communicate information to our group thoroughly enough. We would have liked a notice board in the lobby to post important information for our group. * The towels seemed to be changed whether we wanted them to or not. There were signs in the bathroom saying that, to protect the environment, only the towels left on the floor would be changed, but they all seemed to be taken away, regardless of their placement. * The rooms were much too hot, and the pupils didn\u2019t know how to turn off the radiators.

Getting to the room obviously required the lift, a bit ropey, and then a walk along a few landings, and through a few doors, one of which upon opening had a steep staircase right on the left of it which I was paranoid I was going to fall down, but all okay really, quirky I guess.

This Comfort Inn was adorable because it was a \"boutique style\" so you didn't feel like you where in a typical cookie cutter chain hotel. It was located on 35th street between 5th and 6th so it was walking distance to the Empire State Building, around the corner from Macy's and many other shops and even had an attached resturant ( with the best pizza I've had in a long time I might add) where you recieved a 15% discount as a guest at the hotel. This was also where the contenential breakfast was served each morning. With four teenages in our group it was enough to fill them up so all we had to buy was a hot dog on the street for lunch and then a nice dinner. A half a block away was a Starbucks, 24 hour drug store , subway station and deli. Across the street were two irish pubs (not loud) and parking. Upon arrival our rooms were ready early and we checked right in. There was also a very friendly and helpful bellman at the curb to help us unload. He was also there the day we left to help us load our car. The rooms were not huge but were very clean with new up to date bedding, new carpet and very comfortable beds. The bathroom was also very clean and adequit for our needs.

Our room was spacious, clean although the toilet did get blocked once but that was dealt with efficently by the staff and casued us no real trouble. The free breakfast is great, i espiecally enjoyed the giant bagels and it was certainly enough to start the day. We ate at O'Rileys over the road twice and found it great value for food and generally a nice atmosphere. Macy's is a good shout as it is so near but I think if you are after some really decent more smart range clothes then Blommingdales is the place to go, espiecally for jeans if you like your brands!

We were in a room on the 8th floor- with a view of a backside of some building(didn't really bother us) First the plus points: we had a smooth check-in( although we'd asked for a non-smoking room which we didn't get but the room we got thankfully didn't stink of smoke!) Great location- its a walking distance from most famous tourist spots, macys and empire state building are less than 1/2 a block away. Also, in NYC streets can be very lonely at night but 35th Street where this hotel is located is well lit as it it has a 24hr parking lot which is very well lit and a lot of people are around even at night. Friendly Staff AC in the room was nice and cool! Decent breakfast- though we got bored of it by the 4th day.. Now, the negatives: The Room: it was very very small.. this place is ok for a couple of nights but as we realised, when u stay for 5 nights u need more space especially when the shopping bags start piling up towards the end of the trip! Bad Bathroom: Apart from the fact that it was really small, it was not done up at all- the tiles were old and dirty, the towels were ok, it was just like a shower and toilet were fit inside a tiny dirty tiled room.. u know how good most hotel bathrooms are these days.. this was sad! U didn't wanna spend more than 5 mins in there!! U know it got worse since we were there for 5 days! U can put up with these things for 1-2 nights not more. The BED- I have never seen such a small DOUBLE bed.. U r sure to kick the other person atleast once , if not more! We could hardly sleep for 4-5 hours due to this . I'd say if its only location u care about this place is good, but if like me, U need a good room too.. then look at other options. I'm sure there are better hotels at similar prices.

First impressions, to be fair, were that it was a bit tired and in need of a bit of attention to decor and paintwork.. However, after a while we realised that the Comfort Inn is quite adequate for a stay in New York. Our friends had stayed at a superior hotel in Times Square last year and said that even though the Comfort Inn was a lower grade hotel, it had better facilities. Such as ice and drinks machines, ice buckets in the rooms and provided continental breakfast. Also they said the beds were more comfortable. The breakfast is adequate and a welcome change to having a cooked breakfast each day, healthier too!! The rooms were fine, bathrooms were ok and there is an abundance of fresh towels and flannels each day. If you run out of any toiletries they offer to replace free of charge where possible. Staff were courteous. I have a fear of lifts and was put off at first as they are quite small, but I got used to them. Hotel is walking distance to Empire State, Macy's and 5th Ave. In fact we walked to Times Square a couple of times. Quicker than cab! The only thing I would say against is that they do not have double glazing in bedrooms. But after a tiring day in New York, believe me, you will sleep through any traffic noise. I am a travel agent and have been to some wonderful hotels over the years. Whilst the Comfort Inn is a 2 -3 star hotel, I would have no hesitation in recommending it to families, friends, young people and those who would rather spend money on food, sightseeing etc than just having a classier room where all you do is go to sleep.

The building is over 100 years old and rennovations have been...selective. We had room 612. It's one of the larger rooms, having a feeling of a cruise ship state room. The ergonomics of the room leave a lot to be desired. When getting ready in the morning be sure you close the toilet lid, lest something jump off the sloping glass shelf and into the bowl. The small modern pedestal sink contrasted nicely with the smallish, sloping porcelain tub from the 20's. In fact, everything sloped in the room. The hallways are extremely narrow and covered with the most hideous, awful carpet. If you made a wrong left turn in our hallway, you'd tumble down a steep, narrow marble staircase, never to be heard from again. The room had recently been refurbished, new carpet, wallpaper, bedding and curtains. The room was still...odd and old. The baseboards could have used a lick of paint, about the tenth layer.

His room was bigger and seemed more inviting, so it could be that we just got a bad room. I'm not saying that this is a bad motel - we have always liked Comfort Inns, but this wasn't a good room or a good stay. Whether it was short staffed because of illness or call-ins, or if there just isn't enough staff to care for the holiday crowds was not clear. I don't think it's unclean, but it lacks care. Again, that may be because the staff is down. There are also loading areas for some tye of business on both sides of the hotel which meant noise at all hours.

There are only two small lifts (5 people each max.) so if you got there at a busy time - we saw 3 large school parties arrive during our stay - there could be problems. The famous Alex deserves his reputation. A mine of knowledge who steered us towards some great sight-seeing tours and eateries. Got the impression that he might be making a buck or two out of his recommendations but wouldn't begrudge him that as the tours we took were excellent. Overall the service from all the staff was helpful and polite. Location is superb. 2 minutes from Macys, Broadway, the Empire State and the subway. Also right opposite is the Metro Hotel with a fantastic roof terrace. Late night cocktails on the 14th floor over-shadowed by the ESB was one of the highlights of our trip. We also had a sneaky look around the Metro while we were there and I have to say if you can get good rates it would be a good step up from the Comfort. Didn't try the complimentary breakfast as there is just too much choice elsewhere so can't comment on that. NYC was an unbelieveable place. I had high expectations which were surpassed. Not one part of our break was disappointing and this might lead to the Comfort Inn being viewed through rose-tinted glasses which is why I have only given it an average rating but don't be put off, there's nothing wrong with it for a budget hotel.", "Date": "June 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chapel Hill", "Title": "\u201cNot awful, but not good, for whatever that's worth...\u201d", "Author": "ramblingrose", "ReviewID": "UR3533285", "Content": "I gave this an okay rating because it was mostly clean and the front desk man, Alex, was really out-of-his-way friendly.

Mold on the bathroom ceiling, a precariously placed shelf above the sink that looked unstable, and overall the room was dark and sort of dank. My socks weren't particularly dirty for walking around the room so I think the carpet was fairly clean. The bed sheets seemed clean but I didn't sleep well. We saw no signs of bugs anywhere so that was reassuring... all in all, it was okay, but then we only were in the room a total of 7 hours over three days.

We flew BA from Manchester (don't listen to what they say on their website about the benefits of World Traveller, the Manchester flight is awful). We caught a taxi from JFK and cost about $55 after tolls and tips. It took half an hour and was well worth the yellow cab experience. On arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by Benny who helped get our cases from the cab. A very helpful man, we saw more of him than we did of the now famous Alex. The safe costs just over $1 per night, so don't be surprised when they tell you it's a compulsory charge. It's insured and well worth the payment. You choose your own code and everything was very secure. Our room was on the 5th floor (Room 509 actually) and was overlooked (as is most of midtown!) by the Empire State Building. We weren't facing the road and it was generally quite quiet. Because of the reviews on this site we weren't expecting 5* accommodation. Far from it. We knew that it would be relatively old, in need of a facelift and generally ok. In fact our room was a good size for NY standards, and very clean. Nothing can prepare you for the central heating system though. Our radiator was hidden behind a massive radiator cover. On the first day I wondered what was inside and took a look... A huge rusty antique radiator that even Tommy Walsh wouldn't want to restore! I thought 'this could never work'. But it certainly did, and you'll know about it!!!!!! Despite the notices in the bathroom about using towels twice to save the environment, our towels and bedding sheets were changed on a daily basis. Breakfast was a little bit disappointing, but nonetheless worthwhile. Make sure you're there before 9 otherwise you'll be faced with just cereal or oatmeal. If you do miss breakfast the small cafe next door does some excellent muffins. The location is without a doubt worth the old room. You are literally 2 minutes walk away from the Empire SB, Macy's, Gap, H&M. 5-10 minutes from Times Square. We walked everywhere for the first 3 days. Yes you can walk to the south of the island, but paid for it when our legs seized up. The subway is amazing and the R line (takes you up to Central Park and down to South Ferry (Staten Island Ferry)) is on the doorstep. Beware the entrance at the end of the block is closed on Sundays. The metrocard is cheap and fantastic value. A word of advice, if you're walking to the Flatiron Building please walk down 6th Avenue and not Broadway. We went the 'wrong way' twice down Broadway and felt very uncomfortable on that section. If you're like us and the labels you buy are Diesel, G-Star etc. then the best shopping for you is down Broadway in SoHo. The streets are lined with excellent shops, and one to look out for is called Yellow Rat -------. Starbucks a plenty, so there's always a coffee or hot chocolate stop. Before you buy in Bloomingdales or Macy's visit the Visitor Bureau for a 11% off card. And look out for the free gift vouchers in the NYC guide. Beware, Macy's don't offer a free gift anymore. It's an 11% discount voucher, so get it BEFORE you spend! We will be returning to New York in the future, and will without doubt stay there again. Whether it's old or not, the location outweighs all the bad points. The way we saw it was 'It's clean, and the only time we're here is to have a shower, drop off shopping bags, and sleep.' The bed was comfy and that was enough for us! Don't expect New Yorkers to bend over backwards to be nice to you either. The whole 'service with a smile' seems to have escaped many of the people we came across. Even a street beggar yelled at me when I told him that I had no change. The truth of the matter was I didn't in fact have any change at all. I had my credit card and that's it. He retorted with a hateful 'I'm sorry I'm so goddamn polite', and that was on 5th Avenue! A bit of a down point, but I didn't let it spoil my day. Incidentally, if you're a Brit and want to know what to do about money then we took $900 in cash for food sightseeing etc, and this was plenty for a week. Everthing else we spent was on the credit card. The best credit card to get is the Nationwide Card.

The hotel is in a good location being close to the subway and its within walking distance to Time Square and we felt very safe in the area.

Alex at the front desk was an angel throughout our trip and he really helped us with many things, from where to go to eat and directions and sightseeing. He is truly a tree of knowledge. Now a little bit about the hotel and room. I was worried about the size of the bathroom after reading a few reviews from this site, however i found it was not only ample, but larger than my bathroom at home. (and we ALWAYS had hot water). Regarding the radiators, they do make a wierd noise throughout the night and i suppose it was a little annoying, however, as we were that busy during the day shopping and seeing the sites, when our head hit the pillow we were out for the count and it didn't affect our sleep at all. The breakfast was basic, bread, toast, donuts, tea, coffee etc but it's so cheap to eat out and everything is in close proximity. The lifts were amusing- not slow (we never really waited more than a minute of so and the hotel was full) but the one nearest the desk has a tendency to bounce slightly on ground floor! Macys is at the end of the street and the Empire State Builidng around the corner, and there is a subway stop at the end of the street, only a couple of minutes walk. We used the subway for the first time ever on the second day and and then constantly after that. Of course you have to be careful but it is so easy to use and cheap and really worthwhile considering, as most of the major tourist sights are on the same line. Times Sq is only one stop on the Subway heading Uptown and amazing. All in all the hotel was great, the staff ever helpful and Alex a gem, and we will DEFINATELY be back again soon. Another thing to note, however not relating to the hotel; we took a tour whilst we were there which we booked in advance called a Phototrek Tour. Marc , our photographer and guide was fantastic, he took loads and loads of photo's, delivered the CD-ROM within a couple of hours, and they turned out great. I would suggest visiting his site to have a look as this was one of the best experiences we had whilst we were there.

Nearly booked other hotels, but read terrible reviews for them on this site, so opted for the Comfort Inn based on lots of good reviews. As soon as we arrived we decided we'd made a good choice - great reception area with flower displays changed regularly, really comfortable room with a great view of the Empire State building. (some rooms at the back of the hotel seem to have this view & are quieter.) The room & ensuite bathroom were really clean with towels changed daily. A real bonus was a complimentary buffet breakfast - bagels, cereal, toast, doughnuts, coffee, juice, served in 'Brendan's Bar'. Macy's is 1 minutes walk, the subway is even closer, there are a couple of bars opposite that served good food (if you mentioned you were staying in Comfort Inn at 'Playwrights' they gave you a discount on your bill.) The concierge, Alex, was brilliant - lots of great tips about places to go & ways of avoiding queues. When we return to New York we will definately book to stay here. For a 'chain' hotel & the $130 a night we paid, we really couldn't have done better.

Although it was older, our room was clean. The kids pointed out that the floor squeaked and slanted in the room but we were all comfortable and slept well. We had a back room and were not bothered by the noise in the streets at all. The breakfast buffet was average and the kids certainly missed not having a pool. The price and convenience of the location made up for those downfalls in my opinion. It's a block from the ESB, Macy's and the metro. It's between 5th & 6th Avenue so very easy to get to Times Square or shop. There's a parking garage next stores & across the street so that was also convenient. Would definitely recommend to someone who wants a good budget hotel.

We were on the 10th floor, at the back, which meant it was fairly quiet, with a great view of The Empire State Building. Our children found the rooms plenty big enough to play in and slept well every night on the sofa bed in one room and a double in the other. The location of the hotel was ideal, Macy's one way, Times Square another, the subway close by, so a great place to be with young ones. All of the staff were pleasant and helpful and we had a good meal in the restaurant on our last night. All in all, a good place to go with a family group, bearing in mind we were only using the rooms as a sleeping place in the main.

Overall we were generally satisfied. As I said the price was almost unbeatable and the location was just superb, however the hotel seemed to be lacking in certain areas and was not as clean or as nice as many previous reviews had implied. The room itself was noisy with some heater appliance making intermittent noises throughout the night would have kept many people awake. It had no view but I wasn't expecting anything more. - it looked clean overall but on closer inspection things like the plastic cups and carrier bags had been left under the beds, there was dirt and grime in the nooks and crannies and it just looked like it had been done in a rush. On the positive side the room was massive, the beds were comfy and remade everyday, the water was always hot and the room was really what you'd expect for the money paid. The breakfast could have been a bit better but hey I didn't really expect much more. I've given it an average rating because thats exactly what it was.

We checked expedia and found a few places around US$100 a night but they sounded terrible.. bedbugs, mold, dirty, odours, etc... But the place we stayed last time (the amazing Times Square Hilton) for $127 was really expesnsive this time.. we found the Comfort Inn Manhattan at the Choice Hotels site, and it looked good. $144 a night and it won the gold award from Choice Hotels 4 years in a row.. for superior quality, cleanliness, etc.. so we chose it. Plus it is a great location.. near Empire State Bldg, First Ave, Macy's, etc. We got room 1107 on August 20. The room was fine and clean and everything seemed fine.. the water did get a bit cold occasionally in the shower, but it ok .. the radiator/plumbing banged a bit but it was ok.. But the first morning we woke up.. and there were BEDBUGS crawling all over the two beds (there were 3 of us)... disgusting! We specifically chose this hotel so we wouldn't have to worry about this as it had the gold award. We went to the desk clerk and he was fine and professional.. immediately gave us a new room (907) and the room was fine... no bedbugs... But we all got bitten several times that first night.. lots of big bites and swelling and itchiness.. had to take lots of antihistimines... not fun.. and at checkout no discount or compensation was given.. nothing! For a 4 night stay, we thought we'd at least get 1 night free for our troubles,but no discount. Another problem is the VERY SLOW elevators... we often walked up and down the stairs.. Would we stay again? No.. Times Square Hilton wll be our next stay I think.. a bit extra money is worth it. I don't think they should have the gold award... the room must have had bedbugs for a while as we found several, and considering the number of bites we reecived (my GF got 9 and her cousin got 5) that first night, it was not what we expected for $144 a night. This hotel is nice.. everything was generally ok. it is not a Times Square Hilton, but it is also less expensive. Evrything would have been okay... but the bedbugs ruined it for us. Itchy for many days with big red swellings.
