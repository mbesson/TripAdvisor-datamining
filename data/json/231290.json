Lots of restaurants within easy walking distance, too. The hotel itself is probably a little dated but this didn't deter from our enjoyment. The photos on the websites show a much more luxurious place than what we actually stayed in, so they're either old pics or they've renovated since our trip. We had a family room which was quite large enough for the four of us without bumping elbows. Even so, the beds were comfortable and the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly.

We found the location ideal to explore the eternal city and some surrounding towns (we went to Frascati, Castel Gandolfo & Tivoli) since it is a short walk away from 'Termini', a train,metro and bus station. Also close by are shopping areas such as the cute Monti area and the slightly more 'mainstream' via Nazionale. Also reachable by foot, albeit further than the station, are landmarks such as the Colosseum, Spanish steps and Trevi fountain. Other lovely areas such as Piazza Navona, Campo dei Fiori and the Vatican can be easily be reached by a 10-15 mins bus ride. As for the hotel itself, I agree with most of the points highlighted in other reviews - courteous & helpful staff, varied buffet breakfast (great way to start the day!), clean rooms & bathrooms, TV, safe and free wifi. As pointed out in at least another review, the rooms may appear to be rather drab to those of us not yet attuned to the Roman baroque style! Style apart, the common area of the building calls for some polishing up, though. Implementing other ideas floated around such as a hot water dispenser would be nice too - but all in all it was a pleasant stay and we enjoyed it a lot.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cA nice experience\u201d", "Author": "Undertraveller", "ReviewID": "UR126140667", "Content": "Pros. 1.

Should at least have a hot water dispenser at a central area. 2. Colours of the room looks rather dull and dark. Making the room look quite lifeless.

We chose this hotel after extensive research on the internet and felt that the location and price was great. We were also impressed by the fact that the manager constantly checked and responded to reviews on Tripadvisor and genuinely seemed to be interested in getting everything right for the customer. Our research paid off! Hotel Selene is a great 3-star hotel and I'd come back for sure. The hotel is located only a few minutes walk from either Termini or Republica stations. If you're coming by bus from the airport I recommend taking the excellent Sit Bus which stops only about 5 mins away from the hotel. The reception is indeed based in a small office to the right of the entrance and all the staff there seemed very pleasant and accommodating. The rooms are located above on the top few floors of the building with the breakfast room on the 3rd floor. Our room was a comfortable triple room right on the 4th floor. The interior was tastefully decorated with fabric coated walls and rich blue carpet. There was a mini-bar with quite average prices (\u20ac2 for a can of Coke) but no tea or coffee making facilities (we knew about this before hand and brought along a travel kettle which was fine). The en-suite bathroom was clean and had a hair-dryer. There was also a flat screen TV with many channels (though none in English - strange as there was a photo of BBC World News on the hotel's website). If there is one small complaint - the walls between rooms are very thin as sound travelled through them very easily. For the first two nights I was kept awake until 1am by some noisy Americans in the room next door. I complained about this to the reception and it was dealt with swiftly. Breakfast is served everyday from 7.30am till 10.00am in the breakfast room. The room looks much nicer in reality than it did on the website photos. Whilst not a full-English breakfast, the buffet is decent (especially for Rome) with a choice of sweet pastries, croissants, ham, cheese, salami, bread, yoghurt, fruit salad and boiled eggs (even with a choice of runny or hard). The best thing about breakfast was the sandwich maker - so you could have delicious hot toasted sandwiches in no time at all. The breakfast gave us enough energy for the whole day (and with all the many sights in Rome...you do need a lot of energy). Thanks to reading previous reviews on Tripadvisor, I was aware of the fact that the hotel has a restaurant (COTTA) nearby. It was only through Tripadvisor that I knew that if you are a guest of the hotel you can get a whopping 20% off your bill in COTTA as well as a complimentary glass of sparkling wine. I even asked the hotel receptionist if he could recommend any local restaurants and he did mention COTTA but never mentioned the discount. Needless to say I still showed my key card to the waiter and gave my room number...and managed to get the discount. It's a good restaurant and literally only a few minutes walk away from the hotel. All in all, Hotel Selene was a great experience and I wholly recommend it to anyone!", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cisterna di Latina", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money and location\u201d", "Author": "giusie9", "ReviewID": "UR125091835", "Content": "We stayed the night that it started snowing in Rome!!

Notice, this is not a classic hotel, more apartment style. First the good things: We stayed 2 nights in room 304 at new part of the hotel ( street away from recepcion desk and old part of the hotel ), room was completely interesting, very clean. Toilet is fantastic ( not bathroom, as shower is beside bed... ) Restaurant beside entrance has nice ambient and good food. Hotel has great location, few meters from Piazza Republica and Via Nazionale. It takes 10-15 mins walk to Historical parts ( Colosseo, Roman Forum, Traian monuments... ) and Fontana di trevi. For my girlfriend it was great as Via Nazionale is full of shops. Very near is also Termini station - great way to come from and to airport. Subway You have at Piazza Republica... Yea, stuff is friendly. Things that can be better: We reserved at booking.com superior room, it says: Room size - 30 square meters. This room was not over 20... My opinion is that it would be a lot better that shower is the part of bathroom as We had to put towels outside the shower doors as wather was leaking under the door. Reception desk is behind doors where is written \"Hotel Selene shop\"? You have great sign SHS, make it visible! On both places! Breakfast is... good, but small. Just a bit wider range of meals. And, restaurant in Via Nazionale has some strange pictures...

However, I was disappointed other ta commenters failed to mention some very key downfalls of this hotel. Firstly, we arrived at hotel reception and were briskly taken across the street to an unamed building with literally no markings related to Selene. Receptionist didn't explain what the process was but I assume these apartment were the deluxe. It has to be said, they are great rooms, brand new, fantastic bathroom. Problems; -no wifi -no English tv out of 100+ channels!!! -street noise quite loud -rooms very hot. Air conditioner was set to 19 degrees and failed to cool the rooms over 3 nights. Our door key broke and we had to resolve with reception, this is the annoying thing about staying a street away from hotel reception. There were no phone numbers for reception and absolutley no info in the rooms regarding the hotel (ie check out times, breakfast times etc) lastly, having no details on breakfast, we felt confused about the process. We figured out it's at the reception only to have it full with no tables and no plates to eat either. We ended up skipping breakfast every day. I'm so confused by other comments raving about breakfast, it was worst continental in all of Europe ( trust me, I've been travelling in Europe for a while now) despite negative comments, I think the hotel could solve all of them very easy to make for a better stay. Location is the best place around though, we literally walked everywhere! No public transport required. A real bonus.

It's nothing spectacular, but it's decent and is in a perfect location. It is right near Termini (where you grab the Leonardo Express to the airport). It's right near metro Repubblica as well. The rooms were good. Nice bathroom (with a bidet and a stall shower), comfortable enough beds, and a small TV. There's a safe to put your valuables and passport in. There's no alarm clock on the night table, so I recommend if you need to wake up at certain times for your trip or for the last day to bring a cheap travel clock with you. I tend to do this for my European vacations. Our room was on the third floor. They aren't big flights of stairs, so I recommend that if you're not lugging around luggage for your whole stay, to just use the stairs, as sometimes the elevator can get stuck at a floor or take a while to get to your floor. You can buy an internet card at their front desk for 2 hours, and it isn't a terrible price. You can stop and restart on the card if you're only going to be checking one thing (like to make sure your flight hasn't changed) and resume using the card at another time. The only problem was that I found my hotel room got almost no signal (it went from 2 bars to 0 sometimes), so I'd have to go into the area with the couch to check that information (where I got 4 or 5 bars). Not a big deal though when you're just checking a few things! My favourite part was probably the breakfast. There's bread, cheese, salami, eggs (soft or hard-boiled), juices, cereal, etc. There's also a coffee machine with various options. Though I can never eat much in the mornings, I did try my best to take advantage of this breakfast! ;) I would definitely recommend this hotel as it was good and in a great location.

As noted in previous reviews, the reception is actually next door to the hotel entrance but that wasnt a problem - it is a proper reception desk, and staffed 24 hours. The staff we met were always very welcoming and helpful. If you dont want to go too far in the evening there are nearby bars and restaurants. The hotel itself is on the 3rd floor, via a lift and secure door - there are steps to the lift which may be a problem if infirm, however there is a helpful and polite porter on hand to help with bags and show you how the doors work. We had a twin room at the front of the hotel and the furnishings were old but clean. The room was quite large with adequate wardrobe space, the beds were comfortable and the walls were sound-proofed ensuring it was quiet. There was a tv and free safe in the room. The bathroom was good size and very clean. Breakfast area was basic but again very clean and a plentiful buffet of cereals, juices, yoghurts, meats, cheese, rolls, pastries etc. Hot drinks are brought to order. Have to say the regular coffee was pretty bad, but the cappuccino and tea were fine and the hot chocolates served at another table looked very tempting. We had a early flight on our last day and the reception staff offered to organise a packed breakfast bag for us to take with us - croissants, juice, yoghurt ect - which kept us going after an early start.

The room was a good size, very clean, small bathroom but a good shower. The bed linen was changed every day and fresh towels left in every day also. The breakfast was good, you got a buffet that met all needs from coffee/tea to toast to cereal to fruit and yoghurt. The lay out of the hotel is a bit funny you enter off the street and climb about 2 x 5 steps up to the lift. You go up 3 stories and you come to a door that looks like a fire escape, you need your room card to get inside this door. Then you walk through the dining room to get to the bedrooms which I thought a little odd but the building had 3 hotels in it so hence the 3rd floor was hotel selene.

I chose the hotel based on its location (near Termini), the large number of positive reviews it had received from other reviewers, and price (89 euro/night double occupancy). The hotel is located to the west of Termini on the left side of via Viminale. About a 15 minute walk from the train station pulling a bag, the hotel is also about a 15 minute walk south from the metro station at Piazza d Repubblica. The Selene Hotel is located in the same building with two other hotels (one now closed as of this writing), some offices, and some private apartments. All share the same common building entrance (which can be confusing for the first time guest). The reception and business office for the Selene Hotel is located in a separate space on via Viminale immediately to the right of the common entrance. The hotel office is manned and open around the clock, the staff spoke fluent English, and were very helpful when asked for assistance. In addition to booking the normal tourist tours, the hotel office can also book a private car to either of Rome's two airports at a very reasonable 45 euro for up to a party of 4. This is very helpful when you have an early morning flight, and need to be at the airport before the trains are running. Access to your room is either via the stairs (about 5 flights), or a micro-sized elevator. Most, if not all, of the hotel's rooms are located on the 4th floor of the building - as is the breakfast room. The guest rooms are of average size for Rome. Walls are padded to provide sound proofing. Pictures attached to other reviews fairly, and accurately, portray both bathroom and bedroom layouts and decor. Beds are very firm and closet space is limited. If traffic noise bothers your sleep, ask for a room that does not front via Viminale. Room TV's carry programming in Italian, German, and English (Sky Sports, and CNN International). Rooms also have a small refrigerator and a safe. Breakfast is served between 7:30 AM and 10:00AM, and consists of the standard fare - cheese, ham, hard rolls, soft eggs, croissants, bread/toast, yogurt, granola, milk, juice, and coffee with biscotti. Selection and availability of rolls, yogurt, and croissants are better earlier in the breakfast service than later. The neighborhood has a fair number of restaurants. Two of note are La Cucina Nazionale, and Pizzeria Ricci. La Cucina Nazionale is located about 10 minutes north of the hotel past the Opera and near the Piazza d Repubblica. Hotel guests are given a 10% discount on their bill. About 15 minutes to the west of the hotel is the Pizzeria Ricci. Reputed to be the oldest and best pizza place in Rome (per Lonely Planet), it's a wonderful place to dine. For those who like to get salami, cheese, sandwiches, and water/soda for picnic lunches in the piazzas, there are also 2 supermarkets in the vicinity. One is about 150 meters west of the hotel further down via Viminale. The other is located about 150 meters east of Termini in the Piazza d Independenza, and has a bigger selection of items. Overall, the Selene Hotel offers very good location, value, and service.

I still don't really understand why. We had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the front and we found there was no noise from the street. The room was spacious and spotless. The bathroom was also quite roomy and clean. There was a good choice of food at breakfast. The location was good and perfectly safe. We walked to all the sights, except caught the metro to the Vatican as were unsure of the distance and wanted to get there early to avoid queues.

However, as a family of 5 we needed an inexpensive hotel, centrally located, safe, and clean place to stay during 4 days in Rome. We took a chance on the Selene. Budget wise it matched and it was certainly easily to navigate all over Rome from the Termini which is located an easy 2 blocks from the hotel. The neighborhood is safe; however, a few blocks in either direction and it becomes seedy - FAST. If you've ever travelled to San Francisco you will find yourself feeling much like you are in the Tenderloin. You definately won't feel like you are in luxuious digs when you enter the dirty lobby with worn carpet. A reception receptacle is located next door with two, helpful, but not overly friendly staff. A small elevator (accommodates 2 adults and a few suitcases) can take you to the third floor to the actual hotel entrance. Once inside the doors, the hotel tries to exude an air of Euro-Chic, but fails. Very hard beds, flat pillows, and no basic amenities like soap await you. Nothing like travelling for 24 hours to be greeted by dingy surroundings, a bed like a stone, not even one feather pillow - while not a princess I do enjoy being comfortable in bed when I travel. We expected that soap would be provided and I guess if you can call the detergen in the dispenser in the shower and next to the sink soap, we had it! Breakfast was definately a weakness. While definately a European experience, my children who have wide and varied palettes were pretty much disgusted by the experience. Thank God for coffee and croissants!
