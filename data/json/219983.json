The Hotel du Palais Bourbon fit the bill, as they offer family rooms. Basically, this means a nice sized room for 2 people, and a tiny attached room for the kids.

You can walk to the Eiffel Tower (about 10 min walk) and to the Rodin. The hotel shares the same streets as many of the consulets - so it's a good neighborhood. My main beef was with the front desk & the people running the place. The guy behind the desk was not very welcoming. This would not have been a huge deal, except that we were overlapping an evening with my family from Virginia. The front desk told them that we were not staying there. The front desk told me that they had never checked in (after a brief glance at a hand written register).

The hotel is very old and needs some updating, but is overall clean and comfortable. It is on a very narrow street in a very central location with about a 5 minute walk to the Musee Rodin and a Metro Station, and is next door to several cafes, bakeries, banks and grocery stores. The street itself, like all of Paris, is very picturesque and quiet (at night). The desk clerks (there were 4 total who each worked 12 hour shifts) were very polite and helpful, but did not seem to go out of their way to make us feel welcome. They all spoke English quite well, so check in was very quick and efficient. The hallways were dimly lit and narrow, but we managed. The elevator is TINY and really slow. It can only carry about 3 people. The rooms were a good size for Paris. We were not expecting much. Good luck opening the doors because they are impossible. It takes about 5 minutes just to unlock the door and pull it apart from the frame! The room consists of a larger 14 by 14 ft room with a queen size bed and a little attached room that is only 5 feet wide with 2 twin beds. It was nicely decorated with gray textured wallpaper, an adobe red ceiling and rustic style furniture. The bathrooms had a shower and a tub (two separate areas) but be careful! There is no shower curtain so the floor gets flooded every time. The toilet is in a different room (size of a portapotty) with a tiny sink. There are also toilets between the floors. Breakfast consisted of toast, croissants, pain du chocolat, baguettes, and flax seed bread. There was also hot chocolat, tea and coffee. Since the hotel menu stated \" For your breakfast... Your room rate includes a continental breakfast\" and judging by the reviews on this website, we were under the impression that the breakfast was complementary. None of the staff informed us that there was a 8 euro charge PER PERSON for the breakfast. If we had known, we would not have eaten in the hotel. The total for the breakfasts summed up to be about $300!! Imagine how unpleasantly surprised we were at checkout. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. I feel as if there was some manipulation on their part... apparently they changed their policy without bothering to update their menus. Every night when we got back, they would politely ask us how we wanted our breakfast... not once did they imply the surcharge. I suppose we should have asked point blank, but be very careful about these things! I had planned on writing a glowing review, but after this occurrence, I can't help but view this hotel in a more negative light.

At l'Hotel du Palais Bourbon we pretty much got what we were looking for. The room was clean and had a large ( by Euro standards ) bathroom with a bidet, toilet, tub, shower and sink. There was a small single-car elevator that held up to three people. The room was quiet, had a thermostat, and the bathroom had a built in hairdryer ( perhaps best to check beforehand whether all rooms have this as it could save you from lugging one from home) Also in the room were a small TV, a kettle with instant coffee and tea and a half-full minibar -> .which was *perfect* for us as we could buy juice and milk at the grocery store down the block and keep it cool in the room. Breakfast is either served downstairs or delivered to your room. The complimentary part consisted of coffee, hot chocolate, warm milk, croissants, mini baguette, sliced country bread with butter and jam. The breads were all fresh and delicious. You can add a hard boiled egg or yogurt upon request and pay a reasonable charge for both. The hot chocolate was pretty watery. For any breakfast it's best to let the front desk clerk know your wishes the night before. The woman delivering the meals was pleasant and extremely hard working and spoke only French. We tipped her generously at the end of the week - although it is not expected. The breakfast is a good value-added service, but after several days we were hungry for a bit more vvariety and so we ate breakfast in nearby cafes and packed our unused breads and jams from the hotel every day to take with us for a snack. It worked out fine. Chacun a son gout. It took a fair while to build any rapport with the front desk staff. My rudimentary French from 25 years back helped a little - although they all spoke English they sensed I was trying at least. If you have a direct quiestion or request they will answer it for you, but we certainly never sensed they would ever go out of their way to help us. For example, we were not made aware that there was an airport shuttle service nor made aware of how one must order one's breakfast in advance the night before. Was this aloofness a Parisian thing or a Hotel du Palais Bourbon thing? Je ne sais pas. As mentioned in a previous post, the hotel is about a 15-25 minute walk from most of the major sites in Paris. This suited us fine and saved us a bit of cabfare and gave us a little exercise. Especially if you are travelling with people who have limited mobility be clear that it's twenty minutes to anywhere and not five minutes to anywhere on foot.

The main bedroom had a plasma screen TV (big hit with the kids) with English channels, a large bed (I think it was king), a small table and 4 chairs which we used to eat take in dinners and breakfast. There was also plenty of closet space to unpack and store our suit cases. Off the main bedroom was a long narrow room with two twins end to end where our children slept comfortably. The breakfast was generous and delicious. The hotel is a half a block from the Rodin Museum and around the corner from the Invaldes building and subway access.

Right on a sign on the front desk, the hotel advertises a shuttle that takes people to the airport from the hotel for 17 euros per person. As we had more luggage with us this time than we have had in the past, we didn't want to mess with taking the metro and RER, so at the very beginning of our 5-day stay at the hotel, I asked how far in advance the shuttle had to be reserved, and the clerk said just a day before, and that he would make a note of it and call to reserve it for us the day before we were leaving. Every day thereafter we reconfirmed these plans with the desk clerk, pointing to the shuttle sign, etc., and he assured us every time that, yes, he remembered. So the morning we were leaving, he said something to my husband about how the \"taxi\" would be arriving shortly. My husband had a bad feeling and, as I speak French fluently, he asked me to verify with the clerk that it was the shuttle for the airport. I specifically pointed to the sign for the shuttle and said, \"It is this one, not a regular taxi, right?\" The clerk's response was to act completely dumbfounded and tell me \"Well no! YOU asked me for a taxi! I even showed you the note I had written to remind me to get you the taxi!\" Blah blah blah. I had never used the word \"taxi\" at all, and I had pointed directly to the sign for the shuttle and asked about it specifically when we had asked him to reserve it. There was absolutely no question about what we had wanted. At one point the clerk tried to chalk the problem up to a language barrier, which is ridiculous, although I do think it's possible his French is not much better than his English. He continued to argue and act very rude to me and my husband, and asked if we wanted him to cancel the taxi, which we did not because we didn't have time to arrange anything else. The taxi ended up costing us 50 euros, and I have to say that the taxi driver and the desk clerk seemed to know each other fairly well. Aside from this headache, the room, while generally spacious and well-enough decorated, was not well-cleaned. Our trash had not been emptied from the previous guest, and there was something sticky on the bathroom floor. The inside of the little refrigerator was dirty as well. There was also a vent in the bathroom that seemed to do nothing but pipe in large doses of cigarette smoke. The street on which the hotel is situated is also much louder late into the night than what you might expect for this area. I should also note that, when I initially contacted the hotel for a reservation, I specifically asked if there is a lower rate for the room alone, NOT including breakfast. I was told that no, the room plus breakfast is the only option. On the sheet posted on the back of the door in the room, however, there were indeed two prices listed- 125 euros for the room plus breakfast, or 119 euros for the room alone. The breakfast, incidentally, was delivered half an hour late to our room 3 mornings in a row, and I suspect the only reason it got delivered at all was because I eventually broke down and called reception each morning to ask where it was.

I would have given the hotel a higher rating, but it let me down in three ways: its staff, its location, and its value. The hotel's biggest flaw lies in its staff. The older gentleman (with the white hair and bushy brows) who works the reception in the mornings is very difficult, and clearly not cut out to work in the service industry. I observed him as a guest approached him with \"I have a question\", and his reply was a huff followed by a \"I hope I can give you an answer.\" He acts as if his guests are all too much trouble for him. Any request is met with resistance and condescension. The rest of male staff were also quite indifferent, and generally gloomy-looking, except for the gentleman in the glasses who works the night shift. He was very friendly and helpful. The only smiles I saw during my stay came from the ladies who do the cleaning, and from the lovely young lady who serves breakfast every morning. The always greeted guests with a happy \"bonjour\", or asked if you had slept well. The rave reviews this hotel receives are based on guests who had the luck of staying in the renovated rooms, that is to say, some rooms have newly renovated bathrooms and bedrooms, and others do not. The singles in the 4th floor have not been renovated, and have scratched floors, dirty area rugs, and tired old bathrooms. The only electricity plugs in these rooms are located where the TV and the hairdryer are plugged, not very convenient to charge phones, and other electronic items. The room rate includes breakfast, which consists of 1 croissant, 1 crusty bun, butter, jam, and coffee per person. If you're looking for breakfast variety, you won't find it here. The location of the hotel is ok if you value quietness over accessibility. The area is upper middle class residential, home to many ministries, and embassies, thus making it quite safe. The nearest metro station is Varenne, line 13, but this is not a main line, and many changes are required to get to main areas of interest and attractions. Its location near Invalides makes it accessible on foot to the heat of Saint-Germain-des-Pres (10-15 minutes). I chose this hotel because it offered air conditioned rooms, but the said A/C was weak at best. It was not worth forking out the extra cash to secure a room with A/C when it barely did the job properly. For a hotel of the same category, in a better location (rue de Seine) try Hotel de Seine (with A/C), or Welcome Hotel. Both are located on rue de Seine, close to everything, have excellent staff, and offer similar or better prices than Hotel du Palais Bourbon.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a great location at a reasonable price!\u201d", "Author": "BusinessUser1", "ReviewID": "UR5526317", "Content": "I booked this hotel for a few days holiday for my family.

(in fact two colleagues checked out of their filthy 3 star hotel and moved into this hotel). The desk staff all spoke English and were helpful with directions, etc. The mattress was on the firm side, but I like it that way and I didn't wake up with a backache the way I usually do in budget (and some expensive) hotels. The bathroom was tiled in white with no mold in the bath/shower. The hardwood floor and rather spare curtains and furnishings were better for my asthma as there was no dust. The room had a small refrigerator. I had a double room that was larger than expected for Paris; I also peeked in some single rooms that were larger than the usual. My friends on a higher floor had some water stains just below the ceiling near the window and their room was a bit smaller than mine and seemed less recently refurbished. My room faced the street and there was a lot of street noise with the windows open, so I ended up turning on the air conditioning and closing the windows at night and then the room was very quiet. Breakfast was quintessentially Parisian - a croissant and a hard roll with butter and Jelly and beverage (tea, coffee or chocolate), consumed in the lovely breakfast room or delivered to your room. I found it satisfying and delicious, but if you expect more you'll have to visit one of the neighboring patisseries, boulangeries, groceries or cafes.

It is less than two blocks from the Varenne metro station, steps from the Rodin museum, and about a mile to a mile and a half from most Paris attractions (a bit farther from Notre Dame and Montmartre, where I took the Metro instead of walking). I normally wear a pedometer and walk at least 10,000 steps a day at home; in Paris I averaged about 17,000 steps per day by walking instead of taking the bus or metro, but buffered the extra effort by breaking up the walks with cafe and shopping stops. Criticism? There were two steps up to the elevator landing, and the bathtub was raised and had no grab-bars and thus would not be suitable for a senior or someone with limited mobility. If you're travelling with a senior citizen or someone with limited mobility spend the money for a higher end more Americanized hotel. I can also see from some Paris hotel reviews that some tourists have \"Americanized\" expectations.

Our room on the top floor was really a large 2 bedroom with 2 windows and some charm: ceilings were partly slanted, the modern bathroom had a bidet and the dark wood furniture was solid and heavy. The room had 2 tables and 4 well uppholstered comfortable chairs which were convenient for having small meals to save on Euros (+ a small fridge). Our bed was particularly comfortable while the girl's single beds were OK. Breakfast was delivered to our room every morning (as we elected for that option) on time and professionally by staff in uniform. While the room decor was a bit dated, we did not care as everything else made up for this (what do you expect from a 2 star hotel ?). We had no problem whatsoever with inside or outside noise. Location was excellent, although expect to walk a lot (ex. crossing the long Invalides esplanade to go places). Walk to rue Cler is a good 25-30 minutes and Eiffel tower about 40-45 minutes. The Varenne subway station is closeby but expect to transfer lines to get to most tourist highlights. For food, there is a nice bakery (highly service oriented) on the opposite side of the street where they will warm up your quiches and sandwiches and sell you delicious salads. We suggest you go to the Super Proxy grocery store (green and yellow sign) for a good selection of food items. This is a about a 1 minute walk from the hotel towards the Seine river. You may want to avoid the other small grocery store on the street where prices are about double. Staff is cordial, period. Expect profesionalism but don't expect them to go out of their ways to provide assistance. The owner Mrs Claudon is a distinguished and pleasant lady while her son tries to follow in her footsteps. Only issue we had during our stay was that the a/c was out for 1 day and does not seem to be quite powerful enough. We would definitely go back to Hotel Palais Bourbon and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a charming, no frills, reasonably priced accomodation.", "Date": "August 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest Choice on a Budget\u201d", "Author": "MissJoeyCR", "ReviewID": "UR3723238", "Content": "We were extremely pleased with this hotel. We had an amazing special rate of 120Euros for a triple room with air conditioning, a full bathroom and breakfast included. The hotel was very clean and quiet, was located in a lovely calm area within walking distance to many sights and the staff was helpful. They provided many maps and even had daily English language newspapers. The breakfast did not vary so it would get boring after a few days but it filled us up for sightseeing - coffee, tea or hot chocaolate and a roll with butter and jam and a fresh croissant. However, there was the option to order a full breakfast with eggs and juice at an added price. I have stayed in budget hotels in Paris before and they had dark, tiny rooms with no air conditioning, the shower in the hall and you could hear every conversation in the rooms next to you. The Hotel du Palais Bourbon was a very refreshing surprise! I would definitely stay here again and again ann would recommend it to friends.", "Date": "July 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat find!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3616143", "Content": "Hotel du Palais Bourbon is in an excellent location - a 10 minute walk from the Seine and Place de la Concorde. The rooms are clean, with an up-to-date bathroom. The beds are comfortable and the housekeeping services are very good. There is a mini fridge and safe in the room, which is very convenient. The hotel location is on a quiet street and although we were there during the busy tourist season, we slept soundly all three nights. It is a safe and clean area to stay in. We felt safe and secure all the time. The hotel staff is nice, but not overly friendly. They were helpful in answering questions, taking our tea/coffee order before retiring for the night (for breakfast the following morning) and kept our key at the reception for us while we were out visiting Paris. The breakfast consists of a bread roll and a croissant, jam and butter, tea, coffee or hot chocolate. This is a traditional french breakfast, although it would have been nice to have cheese or yogurt. Regardless, the breakfast was filling and fresh. There are 2 small grocery stores nearby, although I would recommend the store located on the way to the Seine as it is cheaper and has more selection. There is also a wonderful bakery, which sells fresh bread and desserts. We took bread with us to eat (along with cheese and meats from the grocery store) during the day, since eating and drinking in Paris is very expensive. There is also a bank machine on the rue de Bourgogne and we had no problems pulling money with our credit cards. There is street parking, although very limited. Parking is available at Place des Invalides (public lot), but the parking is expensive at 25\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per day. It would be recommended to take the train or a flight into Paris and avoid driving into the city. The public transportation system in Paris is very good, so there are no worries in having access to any of Paris\u00c2\u00b4 major monuments. We took a 2 day pass on the Open Bus Tour (city tour) and it was excellent and efficient. It cost 28\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per person for 2 days and passengers get on and get off at the various stops - at all the highlights of Paris. There are buses every 10 to 20 minutes, so there is no time wasted in waiting for the next ride. Passengers buy their ticket on the bus and can purchase a ticket at any of the stop locations. But don\u00c2\u00b4t forget to get your Open Tour map on the bus as you get on. It was invaluable! This is a great way to see the city. Hotel du Palais Bourbon is definitely worth the price and worth a stay, if only for its location. Everything is within walking distance and if you are looking for the parisian experience, staying in the heart of Paris will offer you just that! It is highly recommended and we would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "June 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA find!\u201d", "Author": "enniscs", "ReviewID": "UR3540824", "Content": "Hotel du Palais Bourbon is a two minute walk to the Rodin Museum, ten minute walk to les Invalides and five minutes from the Varennes metro station.

One was a three person room that had a sleeping alcove for the third person. The rooms were clean and quiet, even though our rooms faced the street.
