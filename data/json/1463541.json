What little time the night we arrived that was spent in the room was simply getting ready quickly to go out, Our kids in the second two rooms did the same. When checking in, my wife and our friend filled out the papers according to the helpful woman behind the counter. Only people she bothered to \"register\" was my wife and our friend. There was nine of us altogether. At 3 am when my daughter and one of her friends that were staying in the room tried to go up, the night watchman refused one of them entry, saying she was not registered. I tried to resolve the situation by signing her in, and I was told that although he was the night manager, he cannot do that, as the desk was closed. While the man was extremely polite and nice, it was horrid. My daughter had to sort their belongings and drive back home at 4am in order for one of the guests with us to have a place to sleep. (Thankfully we only live 45 min away.) In the morning, when we awoke, a few of us were suffering from breathing issues. Upon full inspection in bright daylight ALL THREE rooms have quite a bit of black mold everywhere. In the bathrooms, on the drop ceiling tiles (Who puts a drop ceiling in a SHOWER??) It was VERY disgusting. One of the ladies behind the desk was rude, accusatory towards us, and trying her best to make it out that we were in some way lying. The owner/manager refused to sort anything out with us at all. While he was not rude in any manner, he was still not helpful. He even seemed to try to make me think that simply due to the humid nature of the area, all the hotels have these issues. I disagree, and I am sure other operators in the area will quickly say he is full of it. If you have ANY type of breathing issues, DO NOT STAY HERE!!! You are placing yourself at a health risk.

I went for the weekend Aug 3-5 with my boyfriend & 10 month daughter. The people at the front desk were extremely friendly & made me feel right at home. Our room was suprisingly pleasant. It had a queen bed, tv, microwave, & mini fridge. It was rather small but not so small you're knocking into stuff. We even managed to put my daughters little playpen in their so it couldn't be THAT small. The room WAS clean when we got there & so was the bathroom. It did get dirtier through out the stay but it's our own fault for refusing room service. The maids were friendly & did ask if we needed anything yet we always refused. They usually asked when my daughter was asleep ha. The location is awesome, right on the boardwalk. You don't hear any of the boardwalk noise though which is a plus. The pool was a good, small, but nice. I did spend a lot of time in the hotel & my boyfriend always went downstairs to the shop which was very useful. Its a short drive to CVS & Layton's also. The only con I can say is the parking. The lot right behind the hotel is extremely small & even if you do get a parking spot, it's takes a while to actually get out. There is additional parking but you have to cross two roads & it's quite difficult with a child. So if you get parking right behind the hotel i would suggest you don't move it. Overall it was a great trip in a cheap, warm, hotel. Maybe I'm not half as picky as some people but you're at ocean city.

We stayed for only one night, and had a one-bed room. The room was very small - again, exactly as we expected. Yes, things are outdated - no fancy new tvs, out-dated decor - but we didn't go there expecting the Ritz. The front desk still uses a typewriter instead of a computer. There are actual keys instead of keycards. It is like going back in time - but in a good way. The rocking chairs on the porch are very enjoyable - a nice place to sit and people-watch. The only issue we had was a toilet that would not shut off. We called the front desk, and the maintainence guy was there within 2 minutes to fix it. Additionally, we were parked in by another car in the parking lot - not the hotel's fault - but when we called to tell them, the front desk guy literally RAN outside to find out who the car belonged to, called that other client, and had them move the car. Bottom line, if you are looking for a cheap hotel just for a place to sleep and shower, this will be fine. If you're looking for something fancy, it's not going to be the place for you.

We've been staying in the apartments for several years, and I think this year could be our last. These people refuse to spend a dime to fix the place up a little, and either don't pay their staff well, or just don't care about the job that they do. We had pieces of trash and wrappers in various places in the room, beds are NOT comfortable, the sliding door didn't work properly (had to fight and cut up your fingers to get it closed), and the A/C froze up our first 4 days there. As for the front desk, while they weren't all out rude, they did as little as possible. On one trip to report our a/c not working, the guy said \"What do you want me to do?\" - Gee, I don't know, call someone to fix it??? After many trips over for the a/c problem, they started to lie and say they had no way to reach the manager. Did not appreciate that. We reported the A/C each day, and we were told it was a) turned down too low (bull) b) we must be leaving windows/doors open c) it's so humid at the beach, you can't open windows. Uhhhh, we did NOT open windows. Once in awhile the door was open, because we couldn't close it! And by open, I mean 2 inches. We politely suggested to the manager, that the a/c needed freon, and the filter was filthy (we looked at it). He insisted it was just cleaned, and did NOT need freon. Well, we had 2 maintenance men in the room with us, and while they aren't experts, it was pretty obvious with it freezing up. We even took pictures of the blocks of ice. One of the other units outside was also freezing up. Nobody was even in that apartment, so the \"windows open\" excuse was crap. Well, I started to get irate by Day 3. I did not pay $3,000 for a vacation with no a/c. The manager was quick to tell me that they do not do refunds or price adjustments. No matter that I've been a loyal customer. FINALLY, I guess he found a brain, called in an HVAC guy that said.........guess what?...........needs freon. I swear, the manager (owners son) has been instructed to make excuse after excuse to not spend money, even if it means a $3,000 loss the following year. As for the sliding door, he did scrape some sand out of the track, which made it work a slight better. We suggested cleaning the rollers, at which time he said there were no rollers on the door. Another lie. We could SEE the rollers. He just didn't want to remove the door, and fix it. We did not appreciate being lied to, or someone thinking we're too stupid to know the a/c needs freon, and the dang door has rollers. He also promised to come back and work on the door after the a/c was fixed. He never came back, and I was so irritated at that point, I didn't really care. The dryer was broken the entire time we were there (the part is on order). I guess they don't realize that a 30 year old dryer could likely be replaced for about as much as the part and labor. Also, our vacuum was broken, but it was replaced with another one.....2 days after asking. Previous comments are correct about the floors. Disgusting. Walk through the apartment a few times, and your feet are black. We are very sad that it has come to this, because while we've always viewed it as \"old\" or \"quaint\", we now view it as disgusting. Our neighbor (that will never come back - they had mold in their room) suggested that they refuse to spend any money, and they're just waiting for a large hotel to come along and buy it. I get that, but in the meantime, please, please, PLEASE spend just a little bit.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Cumberland, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAviod the apartments / they are rundown and filthy\u201d", "Author": "PaFamily1", "ReviewID": "UR73312533", "Content": "We have been staying at the Majestic apartments every other year for the past 10 years.

Light fixtures were falling off the ceilings in the 2 of the three bedrooms. The tile in one of the bathrooms is broke / missing, they covered them with a throw rug. The stove had a gas leak; we shut off the gas supply, when we notified the front desk at check out, they did not comment except to make sure we turned in both keys. The calking around the tub is missing. The TV is about a 20-24 inch with a hole in the cabinet on the front. The \"furnished\" utensils are broke and are not a complete set. The apartment was not clean on arrival, we had to run the vacuum, and it also had to be replaced while we were there. We paid around 3100 for the week, a terrible amount for this place. Do your self a favor and stay elsewhere. A tradition has been changed; our family has decided not to stay there anymore.

This was our first time \"in season\" and were surprised at the rates given the age of the hotel. We still enjoyed our stay, but the sheets were never changed and this is something you expect no matter how long the stay (ours was Friday through Monday). We were happy to see that some updates were made to the room since our last visit, however the bed was extremely uncomfortable (backache material). We also visited during \"code red\" weather, and found upon arrival that the A/C was not turned on for us. After carrying our luggage in the heat to the elevator and to our \"extremely hot\" room, one could say we were not very pleased nor felt welcomed! While I totally understand the need to conserve, I would strongly recommend that especially during this type of weather that the A/C be turned on for guests prior to arrival! The water pressure and temperature was also a \"big\" problem, pressure was almost non existent and we could never get proper temperature, either you were getting scalded or frozen and had to run to the back of the shower. Not real pleasant when you were just coming from the beach and looking forward to a comforting shower! All said, I would visit again, but call in advance to make certain to ask that the A/C be turned on for us, and if the water issues had been corrected. Bring you pillows from home, you will sleep a bit better! We never used the pool, although we tried several times. It was small and very crowded.

My husband had been going there for years and I had never gone to OC before. . Neither one of us had stayed on the Boardwalk, or at this hotel before. The pictures online looked nice, and the price for the location was excellent, so we booked 5 nights here. The place is extremely old. It's not the cute, charming old that you want to take pictures of. . it's the old that you want to walk out of and not return to. . the smell you get when you open an attic, of must, humidity, and amonia. . I guess the negatives of the hotel were: The lobby was empty for the most part, and the staff was very scarce and unattentive. When you did find someone, however, they were nice, if you needed ice, or whatever. The pool is out back by the parking lot, and it's on the small side. . . there are filthy chairs surrounding the pool and a few tables with umbrellas. . . however, no one from the hotel watches the pool so it seemed like OC locals were just coming and swimming and then leaving the two times we went to the pool. Like I stated before, the hotel is really old and doesn't smell too nice... the rooms were very dated . . the bedspread was gross and I didn't use it to cover up with. . the sheets weren't changed our entire stay, I know this because there was a stain on the bottom corner and it was there all 6 days. Also we were told we'd have a queen size bed and we had a double. . and it wasn't comfortable at all. Anyhow, I guess some positives would be: the view from the room is sweet, all water and boardwalk! The AC really worked well both in the lobby and in the rooms (which is suprising given the condition of the hotel). . . The bathroom was adequate, it took a minute or two for the hot water to start, but once it did, it stayed nice and hot for the duration of my shower, and the pressure wasn't anything to complain about. . The porch out front with the rocking chairs is VERY charming. Loved sitting there in the evening and watching people! The TV worked well at night when we put it on, but the alarm clock looked so dated, I haven't even seen one like it before, so you might want to set the alarm on your cell!!!! Oh and there aren't any outlets in the wall, Had to use a power strip for cell phone chargers and digital camera battery charger. .bring your own blowdryer because there aren't any in the rooms. Lastly, the hotel has the main entrance on the Boardwalk and then a side entrance which is probably 20 feet from the pool and where you park, which was nice because you didn't have to walk in dripping wet or covered in sand through the lobby, you could just enter the side door and get right into the elevator. Overall, the hotel was nothing to write home about, and we probably would not stay here again.

We complained and they promptly changed our shower head. Unfortunately, it made no difference! It took at least 10 minutes to wash out shampoo and forget about conditioner! My husband resorted to rinsing off with a cup from the sink! Not to mention the little bit of water we had would go from steamimg hot to ice cold in 2 seconds flat.

I saw no noticeable house-keeping problems other than the bathrooms are old and when you have tile, it is hard to have a fresh appearance (I always spray Lysol all over just to be sure). The staff we came in contact with were cordial, certainly not unfriendly. Bedspreads are becoming so taboo - and I always throw mine on the floor anyway.
