[singles and interior, ie., no view, even less expensive] The rooms we looked in on, [two in addition to the one we stayed in] are small, with just enough room for two persons to negotiate comfortably for a short stay to take in the major sights near the Zocalo. The Rioja fronts on a major city-centre street, Cinco de Mayo, which is on the self-directed walking tours listed in the free tourist maps given out at the closest corner of the Cathedral. On previous, longer stays in Mexico City we'd stayed in much tonier hotels with larger rooms, and had we stayed a third night at the Rioja I would have started to feel the difference, I'm sure, but the location and price were ideal for our purposes this stay in D.F.; a viewing of painter Diego Rivera's Murals in three locations within walking distance-the Museo Mural Diego Rivera, the mural in Bellas Artes and the 250+ murals in the buildings of the Federal Sectretariat of Public Education. Over the time we were there [three weekdays/two nights] we saw older tourists like ourselves, young solo backpackers and Mexican businessmen in suits walking through the lobby. The value offered by the Rioja obviously appeals to a broad spectrum of travellers. The streets quieted down after rush hour, and stayed that way until 6 in the morning when Cinco de Mayo wakes for its working day. The woman at Rioja's front desk was wonderfully patient with my halting Spanish, and the bell-boy was able to help out with his try at English, but a better comfort level in Spanish on my part would have been helpful. Wi-fi in the lobby, a 30\" flat screen in the room, and bottled water were part of the deal, and the only evident downside was that the towels appeared to have been boiled and bleached a couple of years too often!! Three doors east towards the Zocalo is a great fresh fruit bar called Jugos Canada, where 37pesos will get you a large choice of combinations starting with 6 fresh squeezed oranges, guava, banana and honey, or if you prefer a \"Vampiro\" blended beets celery and carrot.. --Quiet at 8am but crowded at noon-- We had planned to visit well-thought-of Restaurant El Popular across the street, but were distracted by the large portioned fare at Restarant La Capillia [associated with Hotel Gillow at the intersection to the west] for a lunch, then breakfast and dinner the following day.

But for less than $20 US a night, it is excellent quality. Our room was very clean when we arrived and well cleaned every evening. When required, subway stations are less than 2 blocks away, making it very easy to get anywhere in the city.

We'd read on this site that the staff are unfriendly, but we found that by smiling and saying buenos dias everyday, they were very friendly and helpful. Great places to eat and snack all around. Only reason you might not like this hotel is if you get an exterior room, there is a lot of traffic noise from the street.

In fact, he was very accusatory and unpleasant, wouldn't give me the name of the manager or call the previous receptionist. He wouldn't even give me HIS name, so I could write a complaint to the management. I ended up having to call the tourist police to get his name-- a whole ugly ending to our stay.
