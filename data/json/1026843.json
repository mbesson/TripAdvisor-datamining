There are only 8 rooms in the hotel and the main business of the place does seem to focus on weddings and other large celebrations in addition to the restaurant. Although the owners live on-site, there is only one other front of house staff member, who only works during the day, so it does feel more like a restaurant with rooms, particularly after 4-5pm. As a result whilst the wedding reception we attended was absolutely amazing in every respect, the hotel side of things could be improved. The rooms and hotel surroundings are incredible and of a very high standard. However we were disappointed to find that the restaurant was closed on a Sunday night and all day Monday, and there was nowhere to eat within walking distance. I also asked for an ironing board and iron in the room, and this was provided, but with great reluctance. Although there was a flat screen TV in the room, we could only find a limited number of radio stations (mostly Spanish) and one TV channel (Spanish) which seemed to be under someone else's control, so we had to sit through someone else's channel hopping. Surely international TV viewing (under our own control!) is a basic requirement for a hotel of this standard? Whilst another couple in our group had a coffee machine in their room, we didn't; again something of a disappointment. Breakfast is another area that could be improved. At 25 euros per head this is expensive, particularly when it is fairly limited buffet style with no hot food. A cup of coffee on its own is exhorbitant at 15 euros. Whilst the setting for breakfast on a grand terrace overlooking the hills down to the coast is fabulous, you are plagued by numerous wasps which totally takes the pleasure out of the experience. This problem could be easily dealt with but clearly is not a priority. Overall this is a good hotel; a great building, fabulous grounds, and amazing surroundings. However, by improving the service aspects of the hotel and bringing them up to the standard of comparable hotels, this would make a good hotel into a truly great hotel of international standards.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel, location and staff. Perfect for a wedding!\u201d", "Author": "lollyflashpants47", "ReviewID": "UR21882520", "Content": "I cannot recommend Castell highly enough. We just got married in Barcelona in October and we had our reception at Castell for 70 people. Everyone was blown away by the location, views, rooms, food, staff and the level of service. It is only 35 minutes drive from Barcelona city centre and it is 10 minutes drive down the hills from Castell to the train station that you can also take into the city. They have the most modern, beautiful and perfectly spotless rooms and the wedding suite is stunning - it includes a private terrace with views of the ocean. There is also a lovely swimming pool and restaurant. The owners are so helpful and Anna speaks perfect English. They bend over backwards to help in any way they can and all the staff are 5 star and really look after you. We had our wedding reception here and I am so glad we did! We had our aperitif out on a lovely outdoor terrace overlooking the sea and then the meal and dancing inside a beautiful room with large windows surrounding it. Family and friends are all still talking about it and have said without a doubt it was the best wedding and reception they have ever been to. Upon arrival the drive down into the grounds and up to the castle is beautiful and they had little white lights wrapped around trees, torches and there is a fountain at the entrance. We also chose to have a flower petal carpet at the entrance and everyone loved that. The food they serve is spectacular and it really is like a fairytale. I would recommend Castell for a wedding reception but also for a romantic getaway for anyone. You won't regret it!!!", "Date": "November 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cA slice of heaven a stone's throw from Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "LucyMadrid", "ReviewID": "UR19877006", "Content": "Having just spent a glorious week at the Castell de L'oliver I feel compelled to promote it. It really was a slice of heaven. It is a castle that has been slowly and with utter perfection turned into a glorious hotel set only 35 km outside of Barcelona (it was a really easy half an hour drive direct to the centre). We had a sea view suite which was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. It has an amazing pool area which is hard to drag yourself away from and a restaurant where the service and especially the food served was better than I have had in some highly rated Michelin star restaurants. GO - it is glorious. It is run by a family and because it is their business, they just keep on top of everything and genuinely care. Finally, if I was not already married... it was be the most ideal location for a wedding, it even has a private chapel.", "Date": "September 8, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Castell de l'Oliver", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1026843-Reviews-Castell_de_l_Oliver-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$187 - $434*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Can Milans</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08394</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1026843", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d7/50/d75027d1f1bb8ffec889b39ae89d3b5e1large.jpg"}}
