I had been looking forward to going out for a late supper, but there was no way I was going to walk past the gauntlet of unsavory characters again. I bolted and chained the door and turned on the TV to try to drown out the exceptionally loud band playing at a raucous bar next door. The carpet was disgusting, the bed hard as rock, no blanket and the sink and tub were peeling paint. In the morning, again, guys hanging out smoking cigarettes on the balcony/walkway.

I found the staff to be the best at hotel. If one negative thing to mention about them, I followed few times how front desk employees commented customers in Spanish, not knowing that I understood. Few comments were pretty mean. But if you do not understand, you do not know. The Room, was big enough, but they are shabby. I killed three bugs at the rooms (not ants, flies nor big asian cockroaches), but I did not recognize them. For entomologists: bugs were black/red, big antennas, total length 1\" and fast. So I kept my stuff in my suitcase all the time. Cleanliness was very good, if we measure cleaning employee work, but linen/towels are old (read worn). Carpet is brown, probably became brown over the time, as my socks became brown too. Some cigarette burns can be seen on carpeting and other places in bathroom, meaning that my room and friends too were old smokers rooms, converted to non smoking by sign on the door. Wall papers & paint are falling some places. Paint in my room look pretty new and some of the staircases were painted during my stay too. Looks typical american way of renovation. Just paint over, hiding under. (falling paint is a) wrong or b) underneath is structual problems e.g. moisture). Last day I smelled cigarette smoke, probably came through ventilation. The ventilation vent in the bathroom was only dirty (non cleaned) place in the room. I can confirm other reviewers comments on elevators, that they are old and slow. You maybe want to have a room on the street side 4th or 5th floor. On street side below that the A/C unit can be disturbing. Pool side is towards Highway 836 (4-lane ea direction) creating continous traffic noise. That can be disturbing. The Amenities, Pool and Gym looked very nice, compared to other things at premises. Hotel offers also free transportation to Airport, Port of Miami and Bayside Marketplace, an outdoor shopping mall. The (two component) breakfast is served in the external restaurant called \"University & Patio\" and consists only coffee or tea OR orange juice and croissant or muffin or toast. I would rather exclude the breakfast from room rate and make the restaurant to offer complimentary orange juice(was very good) for hotel residents. Now they tried to sell decent breakfast for customers who were more or less pissed off about the breakfast. Of course the breakfast quantity is based on what the hotel is willing to pay, not the restaurant fault. WiFi/WLan is available at entire hotel, working nicely also at rooms too. The Location, closed to the airport is central at I95/highway 836 intersection and it is just like 5-6 miles from Miami Beach, which is reachable with public transportation, but it is questionable, which means that if you are looking beach holiday, choose a hotel at the Beach. Here the car becomes essential need. The hotel website promotes several things at walking distance, but as european, I disagree from security reasons to walk in the neighborhoods, except the hospitals. So at the end, hotel is well cleaned very old hotel with cheap price. I took my stay as an experience and rather will pay more for better location next time. I think that @choicehotel.com tells the best way: Rodeway Inn by Choice Hotels is defined as : \"Hit the road affordably When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the road -- and on a budget -- you can still stay with a respected name: Rodeway Inn.

We were on a tight budget and didn't really want to pay more for a hotel. Next time we will. The good things I can say are: 24 hr check-in**, 4 channels of new movies playing if you want to just kill a day in Miami, no bed bugs (when we were there), clean sheets, like everyone else says, the restaurant next door is great, and cheap, and it's nice to have the free shuttle to downtown, airport, and cruise port. **I now understand why they say 24 hr check-in. You can't go into the lobby but they have a little window to talk to the check-in clerk, similar to what you might find at a movie theater. So nice after a long flight and arriving past 1 am. If it had been any worse we would have left and requested a full refund. It really suprises us that this is considered a choice hotel. After reading the reviews, I did not want to experience \"sticky carpet\" myself so I made sure to wear socks or shoes around the room. My husband thought they must be exaggerating but he confirmed that the carpet is in fact sticky. The beds are the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on including old youth camp mattresses. You can feel every spring in your back. There is mold behind the headboards, fire detector etc. The wallpaper is bubling or peeling pretty much everywhere you look, and underneath the sink there is a hole patched with cardboard! We actually didn't notice it at first but after talking with others in the shuttle they mentioned the patch under their sink and my husband checked under ours to discover what must be an identical match. The tub had a steady stream even when turned off and although it didn't bother us too much (the noise sort of drowned out the sound of the loud AC!) I would say this hotel is the furthest thing from \"green\" (others on the shuttle had the same steady stream as well). Overall the general grime and filth would lead me to spend more on a hotel in the future.

I have never stayed in Miami before so we did not know what areas were good and what was bad. When we checked in I wasa little concerned as there was a security hut and a guard at the door.

It seemed that the area in Miami the motel was in was not a very good one, this concerned us a little. We finally found our room and went in. The room was very basic and smelt of damp. The dead lock on the door was broken and there was no safe in the room. We felt that uncomfortable that at night we pushed our suit cases up to the door. The shower had no presure and was only luke warm and the paint was peeling off from the bathroom. What really appauld us was the floor. I took my shoes and socks off and was walking around in bare foot. After two minutes my partner said \"LOOK AT YOUR FEET\". They were black. The floor was that dirty that in 2 mins my feet were black. I wet a towel and rubbed it along the floor. The towel changed to black and the carpet changed colour. The floor could do with a really good clean. The TV reception was very poor and fuzzy and we gave up in the end. Also the internet/Wifi had little/no signal.

We have paid at least this much or more for carpeted ashtrays in the past, some of which didn't even give the little soaps/shampoos. All the staff we encountered was very efficient and polite. We called for a port shuttle and it arrived within 5 min. of when we were told it would. When we arrived at the hotel office, an extremely irate person was calling and calling (3 times just while I was waiting for a man to check out, and I could hear him from where I was standing) ; he seemed to think the shuttle driver should recognize him to pull over to pick him up rather than him flagging the shuttle down. We had just left the port, and the driver, my husband and I were all watching for more people to pick up, and not a soul made the least motion to the shuttle (it was plainly marked 'Rodeway Inn'). The lady at the desk was very patient with the customer on the phone, explaining to him that there was no way the driver could recognize him unless he flagged the shuttle down. We arrived at about 10:30 am and were allowed to check in right away, even though we said we could wait. We checked out at 6:00 am the next day and the 6:00 am (earliest one) airport shuttle headed out with 4 of us by 6:05. What one really must take into account is the price asked for the lodging, and remember that it is Miami we are talking about. I am extremely thrifty and checked out literally dozens of locations. The next price point up was in the high $80.00's, and believe me, no better than this one. Is it an older location? Definetly. But more imporantly, it is kept up (at least it is now). The tub & vanity were very recently resurfaced - and let's be honest, ladies, how many of us really consider taking a tub bath in anyone's tub but our own, our mother's or our sister's? Honestly, now. True, the floor paint in the outdoor corridors didn't all quite match for color, but it was fairly recently resurfaced/painted, as were the corridor walls. The room carpet, while not attractive, was clean (I felt it with my hands). We passed lots of open room doors - and I never caught a nasty whiff of anything anywhere. The stalest-smelling place was the elevator, and that only had the 'hot closet' smell you get anywhere in a hot climate. The floor corner behind the bathroom door could have benefited from the detail brush on a good vacuum, but it was dusty rather than cruddy or dirty floor. They are in the process of remodelling or setting up a salon area across the rear hall from the office, and there was none of the funky odor frequently associated with yucky carpet, damaged drywall or plumbing coming from that open door either Our linens and towels were all clean and soft (believe me, I checked them all.) The beds were inexpensive, but surprisingly comfy. Location: Great if you need to be near the University Hospital, etc. or for an overnight. I would suggest that you request a room not facing the main road (University Blvd?). The front wall is all window, and the door did have a gap at the bottom, so there was a lot of traffic noise. The door locked just fine. The pool and its area was nice and clean - I didn't swim as there were a lot of kids, but it all quieted down very nicely by 7-8 pm. Aside from the family-owned restaurant on-site, there are no restaurants nearby (Subway or something about 3 blocks away), which is the reason why I suggest it for an overnight or a 'have to be here' location. Now, the on-site restaurant: It was very good! My last experience with on-sites was horrible (mic. potato & fish stix for $12.99), so I was very aprehensive...until I took one look inside. Great Greek/American food and super service. Prices a bit high, but then again, it is Miami, and I'm not familiar with the area. There was only one young man taking care of both inside and outside: 8 or 9 tables of 2-6 people each, and the food came out hot, and though simple, it was nicely presented. We had lunch there, and 'to go' for supper in our room. Both were quick and hot. We wandered around a little bit to see the place, and I never got a creepy feeling. We saw a few people with 'Security' t-shirts on, esp. as it got dark. We saw no one loitering, even when sitting outside at 6:00 am for the shuttle. I felt comfortable enough going downstairs to the office after dark. They have safety mirrors mounted in all the blind spots we came across, plus some cameras. The snack/drink and ice machine areas were well-swept and looked to be either mopped or hosed regularly. The only drawback I found was that I thought guests had free internet access in the office, but the comp. was connected to some sort of an ATM-type pay kiosk. The comp. screen said I could insert a $1.00 bill, but the kiosk only took a credit card, and required its PIN. I was not at all familiar with that sort of system or the company name, so I did not use it after all: I decided it was worth the extra $3.00 to check in in person at the airport, rather than open up a credit card account to an unknown 3rd (4th, 5th....) party. All-in-all, I was very happy with the facility, esp. when the low price is factored in. Had I spent the $89.00 and up price other similar locations charged, I would have been much less happy. I would call it a 'no frills' hotel (because of the very plain rooms), except that it does have a nice, clean pool area and such a great family-owned restaurant on site. I feel it was a very good value. I will recommend it to friends, and if I need an overnight Miami location again, I will check this one first.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cI would never ever stay there again, very dirty.\u201d", "Author": "guima62", "ReviewID": "UR69914050", "Content": "I am short of words when it comes to this hotel, it was so dirty and smelley, the bathtub was filthy I wouldn't even bath my dog in that bathtub.

There are so many reasons. The free internet is a joke. It would not stay connected and whenever it did connect at all it was at low and very low connection before it would repeatedly disconnect over and over again. I was unable to complete my online school assignments! The lobby restaurant was not open the hours that were advertised on its door. The TV was a flat screen and looked all nice but it is like they say, looks can be deceiving. It was full of static and barely got reception. Not one channel came in clear. The cable hook up for the tv was hanging out of the wall through a hole. Half of the ice machines where out of order. Basically every other floor (there are 4) had signs on the machines indicating that they were out of order. There was pee in the stairwells. I reserved a room for two adults and got only one wash cloth. The door lock fell right out of the door and we had to repeatedly reinsert it to lock the door. Lastly there was no hot water at all so we were unable to take showers before our afternoon flight.

I arrived, expecting the efficiency that I'd reserved and ended up in a dump of a room that didn't even have a working dead bolt or telephone. The AC unit did not have temp control knobs, the phone jack was ripped out of the wall, no clothes hanging rack, no cold water in the sink, no remote for the tv that only had 4 channels, paint spattered all over the bathroom and they charged me full price. The free continental breakfast they boasted turned out to be a voucher for coffee, oj and toast in the restaurant. They moved me to an efficiency on Sunday, the inside of the microwave is full of food debris, there is no cover on the bathroom light, the cover on the AC is falling off and I had to prop my foot on the wall to get enough leverage to pull the faucet on in the shower. I was promised a 20 minute wait at the airport for the free airport shuttle, after 3 phone calls to the hotel and 1 hour 20 minutes, the shuttle finally arrived. This moring the elevator is out of order, so we can't use the luggage carts. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to someone I didn't like, much less a friend. I'm currently reevaluating my Choice Privileges membership, and I'm not likely to keep it.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cI liked this place!

Having booked on the internet, no where did I read that the shuttle is ONLY operating from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. Even the marque in the Miami International airport states airport shuttle, implying 24 hour, NOT correct, as they told us that it was a $20.00 taxi ride to the airport.

If you want to look up reviews under the other names they are Comfort Inn Suites Days Inn Travel Inn Civic/Medical Center I warned my father and the gentleman who kindly booked our group trip that we should not stay at a hotel where one of the reviews on this site said, \"Run Forrest Run.\" I knew that trying to save a few bucks wasn't going to be worth this hotel. But the nice man who booked our trip assured us that hotel management had just completed a $1,000,000 renovation. I told them they were foolish to believe this but what do I know? My parents room's toilet did not flush. Ever! They complained and asked for maintenance and they never came. Not ever. My mom took a shower and the tub would not drain. Ever. All of our rooms smelled like Ant Spray. So bad that when you licked your lips you could taste it. Our air conditioner didn't work. And honestly we didn't need it because it was cool the night we were there but the problem was it was shut off and wouldn't quit running. Well it kinda did. It would shut off and then start up again and shut off and start up again. But it was in the off position. (That actually wasn't a huge problem but an annoyance) You can tell as soon as you pull up that this place is not well maintained. We did eat at the restaurant located in the hotel and the food was fine. But Continental breakfast was the joke of the day!!! A 4 oz juice and 1 slice of toast, oh and 1 cup of coffee ! ROTFLOLPIMP! I kid you not! So of course we ended up BUYING a real breakfast. You had to ask for butter. They weren't giving it to you without asking. We were told when we called before the trip that there was a store within 5 minutes walking distance. (We wanted to buy water and coke products to take on our cruise) Well I don't know how fast the person who told us that walks but it takes a lot longer than 5 minutes to walk 8 blocks. The waitress told us (4 females) not to walk outside around the hotel at night because it was not safe. There were no redeeming qualities about this hotel at all. We aren't picky either. Give us a clean place to sleep and give us what you promise and we are happy. This place was a dump. Very dirty, bad location, staff was not helpful in the least. I hope if you are reading this and someone is trying to convince you to stay here that you tell them, \"No WAY!\" I wish I'd been that smart. lol! We did live to tell the tale but NEVER AGAIN!!!

One side of the building had a huge 10 x 40-ft open dumpster in the middle of the parking lot. What a wonderful sight to wake up to when you step out of your room in the morning. Don't worry about losing your appetite for breakfast, though.... The \"complimentary\" breakfast--despite being a Choice Hotel, this place doesn't serve breakfast, they give their guests a voucher for the restaurant adjacent to the property. The restaurant will give you a glass of juice and ONE piece of toast. If you want anything else, you have to pay for it. Water pressure is very poor, had difficulty flushing toilet as a result. Fortunately, I spent little time at the property, as I was out and around Miami throughout the daytime and only came back to the motel to sleep. At least the place was conveniently close to a public transit station, so getting to downtown Miami was quick and easy. They also offered free shuttle service to the airport (which was 5 minutes away). Still, it's a very nasty property.

We stayed on the 4th Oct, and regret ever making the booking. When you check the Hotel's web site they claim they have just be renovated, what they forget to say is that the renovations are of such a poor quality that I hate to think what the hotel was like before. Paint applied to peeling wall paper, re-plastered walls which have not been smoothed out but painted over, bathrooms that have a yellow/nicotine coloured lamp shade - have I painted a pleasant environment to sleep in? As for the corridors, discarded TVs just blocking the hallways, Fire Exit signs pointing the wrong way or broken, lifts/elevators that are so tatty you do not feel safe in. Shuttle service, well on the Sunday of my departure (approx 11:00am) there were approximately 20 people wishing to use the service to the airport & cruise port, but only one vehicle that has seen better days. The hotel staff do not communicate with clients, lifts are out of action but no signs informing the customer. If you ask for the duty manager, make sure it is between Monday thru Friday, as there are no management on duty at weekends it would seem! When the management did eventually contact me by email (only because I complained to Choice Hotels Head Office - who were excellent), they sent me a standard letter, which I replied too, and still waiting a response after over a week.
