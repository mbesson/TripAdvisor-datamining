When we arrived (from Australia - a long flight, and then a ferry) our room wasn't ready (late afternoon). No big deal, but an indication of service - no offer of a drink while we waited, etc. We wandered around and discovered the food on a stick that was everywhere. The worst thing, for me, was the very hard bed. It was barely different to sleeping on the floor. We asked for a room change but they said all the beds were new - and the same as the one we had. After the first night of fitful sleep, we said we were cold, got an extra doona, and put that under us, so we had a layer of something a bit softer to sleep on. We still didn't sleep very well. The thing is, we had a great time on the island - I liked it much better than the rest of Hong Kong, with its windy little streets, beautiful seafood, and nice walks. But they desperately need to change their mattresses. Also, I didn't care about these things but you might - water damage on the walls, a small and awkward shower.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cClean and Tidy !\u201d", "Author": "lungkm", "ReviewID": "UR132144655", "Content": "1, Clean and Tidy. 2.

It was a welcome change from my normal regular stays in Kowloon, TST or Wan Chai... The island it self exceeded my expectations... I decided to book a room at the B&B as it is only one of 2 places you can easily book in advance on line... I went with what they call \"Suite A\" at their Tung Wan Road location... They have 2 locations on the island... It was not a suite as most frequent hotel stayers will know, which usually has separate and/or divided living and sleeping areas... Suite A is in fact the 2nd largest room they offer at 250sq.ft and advertised as a 3 person room... It has 1 double bed and a very small single in the same area and does not have a separate living area... Although it does have a small fridge which was good to have... This room would do a family with a small child fine for 1 or 2 nights... Anything more than that or for 3 adults then you might want to look into their \"Family Room\" which is 450sq.ft with 2 double beds, one single bed and 2 bathrooms... This is advertised as a 4-5 person room but would work great for those that like space or interested in a longer stay for 3+ people..! The room it self was very clean and did the job... On top of the building is a fairly large terrace with tables and chairs... Excellent place to go get take-out and bring back to eat here... Breakfast was included and was basic but good... You have a few choices of how you want your eggs cooked and the meat you want... You also have a choice of orange juice or coffee. The location is great and easy to find from the ferry... Exit the ferry pier and turn right and a quick left... Go straight and in about 1+ minute you will be there... If you continue past the B&B you will be at the beach in about 30 seconds... This part of the island is only 220m wide..! So if you are looking for a place out of the fast paced concrete jungle of Hong Kong as most people know it... Then give this a try..!

The rates are actually higher than its website says, they explained tat it was because of the Easter holiday. The location is great - just as it says it's 2 mins from the ferry and 2 mins from the Tung Wan beach, and hence it's very convenient to go for some nice food, groceries, and it's close to the hospital too. The Internet connection is good, not many channels on tv. It's a shame tat the windows are all locked so you can't open any of them. Even though there's an aircon, since the bathroom is builtin, you can still smell the mildew and humidity makes you not so comfortable.

Access to the rooms was only through a staircase (no lifts), hence may pose a problem if you carry heavy or large luggage. Stayed in a standard room but was pretty spacious (compared to mainland HK standards). The bathroom/shower stall was a 'luxury' and there was a 'nice' feature installed meant for courting couples but I shall leave you to visit the hotel to find out what it is. Check-in and check-out was prompt and efficient (in the usual HK manner) but the staff may have difficulty conversing in English. Good: Location on Cheung Chau, near to a few 24-hr convenience stores. During my stay, street hawkers near the pier were still selling local snacks even after midnight! Bad: It seems that the wifi connection is only active at the ground floor? I only stayed one night, so did not clarify this with the front desk.

Breakfast (Western) was minimal but adequate (not a place you would linger over breakfast). But who would want to when there is so much good, cheap, food around and lots to see. There was a night attendant and they happily provided us with a carafe of boiling water early mornings. Cheerful and efficient staff. Overall a great value. Cheung Chau Island is just delightful. You can immerse yourself in an authentic community. The B & B, apparently a novel concept on the island, is a first rate, budget value. Recommended, but be prepared for the tiny rooms. If you can get it, pay for the larger unit.
