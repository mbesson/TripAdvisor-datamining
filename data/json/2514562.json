Many tour companies pick up at the nearby Corus Hotel (much more expensive), so that is also a plus. The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful.

After reading last reviews here I was bit scared but I must say, we were satisfied. Our room was on 3rd floor. The room was not very big, but on the other hand there was enough space where to put our big luggage. The room was very clean, cleaning service provided every day. Bathroom also small, but clean and acceptable. The only problem was very low water pressure, so it was very hard to take shower, washing long hair was almost impossible. Also satelite TV offered very low number of chanels, but this is triviality. Walls are very thin, so you can hear TV and voices from the next room. There was a safe box which we found useful. Breakfast served in the ground floor was simple - not continental in my eyes, but you could eat enough. They offered baked beans, mashed eggs, hard boiled eggs, toasts, jams, butter, cheese, 3 types of cereals with milk and some canned fruits. Breakfast was served from 7:30 till 9:30, but some of the guest came late at 9:30 and the staff had no problem with that. Staff was very nice and helpful, providing coffee and tea. We were missing some saussages or ham coz the breakfast became quite monotonous every day. For late coming it was sometimes difficult to find cheese or juice - they were run out. Reception staff was ok, adviced you when you needed. The wifi internet is not free. You could have it for 24 hours - 5 pounds, 72 hours - 10 pounds and 7 days - 25 pounds. They also offer shorter rates (1/2 hour and 1 hour) but these are only for using hotel computers in the lobby. I found internet quite expensive in comparison with the price for one night. There is a nice pub Mitre across the street and Sheila cafe with very pleasant staff and nice offer of sandwiches. The hotel also provides taxi drives to Kings Cross and St. Pancras for 20 pounds.

Unfortunately the friendliness of the staff was limited to the two guys working on day shift. Everything else after the reception was..more or less a disappointment. The room was absolutely the tiniest HOTEL room I have ever seen! It wasn't much bigger than a broom closet! If I placed my luggage on the floor, I couldn't open the door and had to jump over it to get to the bath\"room\". Every time I wanted out, I had to close my luggage and place it next to the bed or in front of the toilet seat. There was not even a sliding door between the bath and the room itself, so all the steam, smells, everything spread to the room. The bath was refurbished, luckily, but since the shower nozzle could not be adjusted, you couldn't take a shower without getting your hair wet. The shower booth was so tiny that if you moved or turned, you touched the walls immediately! If you left the door open, the whole place got wet. There was no place to hang your towel or place your clothes or even toiletries. There wasn't even a proper coat rack to hang your longer coat or any longer pieces of clothing. Well, there were two hangers, so... There was no extra seating in the room, no chair, nothing, but on the other hand, there wouldn't have been room either... The only place to put your toiletries or shopping or anything was by the headboard and the shelf was so narrow! There was a tea kettle, but I just couldn't stomach the thought of drinking anything coming out of it. Also all the walls were stained and the carpeting so worn. On the night of my arrival, I woke to the freezing temperature in the room. The radiator was not working, neither could I turn on the heat pump on the wall. When I complained about it, it took hours before anyone could come and see either of the appliances. There was no extra blanket either. In the morning I realised why it had been so darn cold - the window was BROKEN behing the curtains!! There had been some sticky tape over the cracks, but they'd dried and dropped to the sill ages ago. Later on it was revealed that there was something wrong with the plugs in the room - how safe was I! The breakfast was lousy. Cereal, toast, canned fruits (which I saw no one touching), beans and scrambled/boiled eggs. You only got eggs and beans if you happened to go to breakfast early enough. How on earth can a hotel run out of breakfast!?! No apologies were made. They are advertising for their pub, but at least I couldn't find one. Perhaps it was the door that was closed next to the brekkie room? If you're accustomed to the 13.00 or 14.00 late check outs, don't dream of such in this place! It's 11.00 in best case and getting even that depends on who you're asking.

We were aware of rooms being \"bisou\" (small) and rather dull ambience but when in London, \"beggers can't be chooses\" so to speak. Our first room was quite small but OK for the price.

Unfortunately, on our last night, we headed back to the hotel in the afternoon to find out that we had been kicked out of our room, our luggage as well as all of our other bits and pieces had been moved into another room by one of their staff and that we would be sharing a double room (with a small double bed). This room faced the pub across the road and I couldn't get to sleep because of the noise and the incredibly uncomfortable bed. I was just glad to be leaving the hotel the next day.

I booked this hotel, because of its convenient location (very close to the tube( Lancaster and Paddington station) and the train (Paddington station)) and its low prices (compared to the other hotels in London, that cost a fortune). I knew from the beginning that it wasn't the best in the west, but i took my chances. To tell the truth, I was a little bit terrified by the reviews of some other travellers in Tripadvisor, and frankly, I was expecting the worst. Nevertheless, we were given a deluxe room on the 1st floor free of charge (we had booked a normal room instead), which was really small (about 25 sqm), but ok in generall (see my candid photos). The bathroom was also small but newly renovated and very clean, which is the most important. There wasn't enough space for the suitcases in the room, but finally we managed. There was also an LCD flat TV, but there weren't many chanels. The breakfast room was in the basement, but was newly painted and was really clean, I didn't detect an unpleasant smell, as some other travellers did. I must admit, though, that the breakfast was rather poor (coffee, tea, orange juice, one hard-boiled egg per person, toasted bread, butter and 5 kinds of marmelade). The staff that served the breakfast was very very kind, friendly and efficient, we had no problem whatsoever. As far as the reception staff is concerned, it may not have been native British, but we had no problem with the communication (they spoke relatively good English and were very friendly and polite). To sum up, the hotel was ok, considering the money we spent for it. It wasn't the best hotel I've ever stayed, but I didn't expect something more. In my opinion, I think that the reviews of the travellers in the Tripadvisor site have really brought a result: the administration of the various hotels takes the reviews into consideration, and tries to improve the conditions and the staff attitude of the corresponding hotels. Tripadvisor reviewers, keep up the good work!!! PS. The pub \"Mitre\" across the street is a must! It has a very nice traditional environment and really good, non-expensive food!

Firstly, we were shocked at the quality of the deluxe rooms. They were slightly cramped but the amenieties were superb. There was a flat screen Tv with a large selection of challenges. Also, the mattress, although it squeaked, was very confortable. I was travelling on business and the WIFI was superb. It was very useful and fast, although slightly expenisive. Also the in-room safe was helpful. The breakfast was adequate and all the staff were very polite. I would recommend this hotel, especially if you stay in a deluxe room.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jersey", "Title": "\u201cdont even think about this hotel\u201d", "Author": "theory66", "ReviewID": "UR8066925", "Content": "Stayed over night with my wife,was given room at back of hotel where there is a building site with non stop noice.Asked if we could be moved but said we would have to pay extra for a deluxe double and was told they couldnt here anything anyway,lies!

In a city like London, it was relatively cheap. But pay peanuts, get monkeys... Three of us booked a triple room - there was barely enough room to walk without smashing hipbones on the ledge built onto the wall to hold the tea/coffee. In truth, it should have been a double without the added single bed. Protests had us moved to a quad room - no larger really but a spare bed to park the bags. The remaining complaints are all small, but together combine to give an overall feeling of dissatisfaction: Extremely uncomfortable mattress (swapped the next day.) Dirty blankets (replaced the next day.) Only one towel each and no bath mat. Refurbished interior but tacky around the edges. Free internet only accessible in the foyer on your laptop - at painfully slow speeds. (Very expensive broadband available.) Breakfast (included) was toast, 2 juices, 2 cereals, coffee and a cold hard boiled egg. Every morning. The Elysee is in a good location but one gets the impression that it is milking that by cramming as many guests in to it's rooms at as low a cost per head as it can. Certainly, it was full over the weekend. If all you want is a bed, go for it. If you want a comfortable bed and more, look elsewhere...", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Elysee Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d504754-Reviews-Elysee_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$115 - $551*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">25-26 Craven Terrace</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Hyde Park</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 3EL </span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514562", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c0/e1/c0e119931e65c3523fcf2fe5bf724ab26large.jpg"}}
