The room we had was at the back of the Hotel away from the other rooms so it was very quiet. The room was very big as was the Bathroom and it was very clean. My only criticism was the bed was too hard. I noticed that some of the rooms wer quite small and cramped so we were lucky with our room. The location is perfect a 5 minute walk to the Aerobus terminal with buses running every 10 minutes to the Airport.

The boys had FC tickets so I wanted a central location where my daughter and I could entertain ourselves while they headed to the game. My one concern was reception, after reading some of the reviews. My expectations were set very low so I was quite taken aback at the exceptional service we received on arrival. The gentleman on reception could not have been friendlier or more helpful. His night replacement was equally as friendly. I signed up for the wireless for an hour at night and had no issues. The value point for wifi was 8 hrs for 5 euro, but there was no chance of me staying awake. The location was just fantastic. There were a few issues with the rooms - the doors are really hard to close so people tend to slam them. So when you're in your room you can hear people banging doors regularly. The elevator was loud and I was surprised they didn't constrain its hours of use. While the rooms themselves were spacious, clean and quite nice the stay was a bit hindered by above mentioned noise. It never woke us but was noticeable when trying to nod off. That being said, you just can't beat the price to location ratio of this hotel. I would recommend it for charm, location, service, function and value.

We therefore wanted to stay in a central location to allow easy access to all the main attractions. We investigated several options for hotels but decided to stay in the Nouvel Hotel following positive reviews. The hotel is officially rated as 3 star, and to be honest this is an accurate representation. Anyone who reviews this hotel as 5 star is mis-representing the hotel since 5 star luxury is not what this hotel is about. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the hotel is exactly as I would expect for a 3 star rating, so these comments are not intended to be negative. The Nouvel Hotel is clean, relatively basic, and functional, but its greatest asset is its location just off La Rambla (almost at the top near to Placa Catalunya) on Calle de Santa Anna. Anyone wanting easy access to the city either on foot, via the tourist buses or the Metro is ideally located at this hotel with the tourist (and airport) buses and the Metro operating from Placa Catalunya. La Rambla provides plenty of amusement with the various street entertainers, artists, illegal street hawkers (and police regularly chasing them) and with a vast array of superb restaurants. In the hotel we had a triple room, which was on the 3rd floor and luckily over-looked the (mainly) pedestrianised street, so had plenty of space and 3 small balconies. As others have commented, the beds were somewhat firm but bedding was clean, as was the bathroom which had a good shower. As you would expect from a city centre hotel it wasn\u2019t all peace and quiet, but when using the hotel as a base to see the sights this isn\u2019t the main criteria for selecting a hotel, so expect to hear a little street noise in the morning (workers travelling and shops opening) and late evenings (daily garbage clearance). The staff were all friendly and helpful, particularly the reception staff. The breakfasts were fairly basic (being an English man abroad I still can\u2019t along with cold meats and cheese for breakfast), so next time we would stay room-only and use the local patisserie which was located directly across the street from the hotel.

When our travel agent suggested a very expensive, 4-star hotel for those two days, we decided to try out luck (with a bit of guidance from another friend who had been in Barcelona the previous March) on the Internet. We knew the general vicinity where we wanted to be, and as luck would have it, our search yielded the Hotel Nouvel on Santa Anna. We couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel. It is located just a half block off Las Ramblas, the main shopping and eating avenue in Barcelona, and about a block from Placa Catalunya, the hub of the city. From the minute we arrived, the manager, Roberto, was so welcoming and helpful. The hotel is small with just 78 rooms, but the street it is on is very quiet considering it is so close to Las Ramblas, which is bustling with people at all hours of the day. If you are looking for great views, don't expect them here. Since we knew we'd be getting all the scenery we'd want on the cruise, we just wanted a quiet, clean place to sleep for those two nights. We absolutely loved this place. The decor gives an Old World feel while being thoroughly modernized. We definitely want to return to Barcelona someday to see more of what we just had a two-day taste of, and when we do, Hotel Nouvel will be our choice of accomodation.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClean, safe, convenient hotel\u201d", "Author": "musthavetravel", "ReviewID": "UR118389224", "Content": "This hotel is exactly what I wrote above.

Overall, my opinion was mixed and I will highlight the pros and cons of my stay. I was able to get this room for $52.00 a night. I had searched Barcelona hotel rates every other day for months and this hotel had a one-day sale when it normally sold for around $107.00 per night (next week it\u2019s going for $199.00 a night). One major plus about staying here is the location. It\u2019s just off La Rambla (make a sharp left turn after the first block on the left-hand side walking down from Placa Catalunya) and only about a 5-minute walk from the Aerobus stop at La Placa Catalunya. I\u2019d recommend taking the Aerobus from the airport since it cost only 5 Euros per person and they leave every 15 minutes. The hotel is only a short 3-minute walk to the major subway stop in Barcelona, La Placa Catalunya. There are many nice bakeries and places to grab a bite just feet from the hotel on Calle Santa Anna. My wife enjoyed the Santa Anna Restaurant, which is steps away from the hotel and open until about midnight. The room itself did not meet my standards. First, it was very small. The bed was small as well. Actually, it was two single beds pushed together -- each with separate blankets. The bed was very hard. The bathroom was on the small side too. The shower was standing room only, though the pressure was very strong and the water very hot. I was most disappointed with the amenities. The bar of soap was less than a centimeter thick (no exaggeration) and there was no shampoo, conditioner, or lotion! They did provide some packets of body gel. There were two hand towels and two body towels that were on the small side. Some more towels would have been nice. The room did have a nice wall-mounted flat-screen television. The channel selection was pretty bad with only one channel in English. I think it will be a long time before I voluntarily watch the BBC World News channel again. The thermostat worked well so you could adjust the room temperature accordingly. The rooms were at least clean, which is a big plus. There were a lot of little things that could have improved the quality of the room. First, they only had one tiny wastepaper basket and that was in the bathroom. There was also no alarm clock radio. There was no coffee maker or refrigerator. There was not much closet space and drawers for clothes. The hallway area outside the room was very loud. The hallways have no carpeting which amplified the sound of closing doors and conversations. Also, the maid\u2019s service cart was very loud whenever it moved. Although there were many minor issues with the room, it helps to remember that this is Europe and these types of rooms may be the norm. The hotel is also 92 years old. The staff was friendly and helpful. \u201cRoberto\u201d was very pleasant and helpful. He checked us in promptly and offered to tell us about the city, but we were pretty tired and my wife had previously visited Barcelona so we declined. He seemed a little offended, but none was meant. I also have to give credit to another staff member who did something right by NOT fulfilling a personal request. The room was registered under my wife\u2019s last name, which is different from mine, and I lost my key. When I tried to get a replacement key to the room by myself, the staffer could not verify my claim that I was her husband (he had not seen me before). He did the right thing by not giving me a key since it shows they care about security. All the staff spoke English well. One aspect of my stay that was completely absurd and insulting is paying a 20 Euro deposit just to get a remote control for the television. What are they afraid of, that I\u2019m going to fly from New York City to Barcelona with sinful thoughts of stealing a remote control to take home with me? It would never even work on my own television anyway! To paraphrase Ronald Reagan at the Berlin Wall in 1987, \u201cNouvel Hotel staff, tear down that remote control policy.\u201d We did not fly all the way across the Atlantic Ocean to stay in our hotel room all day. Therefore, the room served its purpose and I was able to relax at the end of a day of sightseeing. Also, for $52.00 a night along with its prime location, I saved a lot of money. Had I paid a lot more, I might have given a lower circle rating. If you like the antique charm, then add a circle. Don\u2019t forget to bring your own soap and shampoo and keep your expectations in check. Marc T.

Unless youre over 50, the staff treat you like swine. I was sweared at the first time i had the tv loud in my room (including f's and s's). Noone to help with luggage. When i asked whether there were any good restaurants in the area, the language barrier made it a little difficult to understand, but when i asked them to repeat it, they told me to 'go away and find it myself'. They not only insulted me but there fellow guests as well. i know first hand that the staff's behaviour was not just resticted to us. 5) On the day we arrived we were given a curfew at 10pm! doors shut after, and if by chance youre late, the swearing happens all over again without us saying a word. 6) The rooms may look attractive, however, once you're there the hotel is dark and dingy, the rooms are small and infested. However, beside the cockroaches. there was a bed, shower and sink all good. There was a lot to be dissapointed with and if you, like me, surfed the web for hours looking for a nice hotel really close to the city centre with is nicely in your price range, and come across hotel nouvel, please do look again, because after staying at a hostel straight afterwards the hostel, rated 1, was a lot better, im not kidding and this was with regard to staff, location, and price.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "waggy", "ReviewID": "UR33426869", "Content": "Friends stayed here as we stayed in another, they got best deal.

We had read the reviews and took pot luck as they differed so much. We were not dissapointed. On arrival at Barcelona airport, we took the A1 bus to place de Catalunya for e3.75, very cheap! The hotel was 5 minutes walk from the square, off the Ramblas, and easy to find. We were welcomed by Roberto who was very charming and very helpful. He explained how to see Barcelona in the short time we were there, where to get the tourist bus etc. The hotel is old and there was some work being done in the foyer but it was clean and comfortable and excellenlty located which is what you need when in Barcelona for just a few days. The ceilings are very high and the doors to the room were huge, must have been at least 10 foot high. We stayed in room 244 which was at the side and had a tiny balcony. The room was bigger than some we have stayed in and adequate for our stay. It also had a flat screen TV which was a surpise, however, you needed to pay 20e deposit for a remote which was given back when you returned it!The bathroom was nice and had a hairdryer, bidet, bath and a great shower! Breakfast was simple, you had to find a table and was self service. The scrambled egss were good but the beans were not our baked beans and the sausages were frankfurters! But there were cereals, bread rolls, croissants, fruit, yogurts cold meats and cheese along with teas, coffee and fruit juices. Although not what we would expect in a hotel at home, it was adequate to start your day. We found most restaurants in the Ramblas quite repetative but found a great restaurant that you should visit and we highly recomend. It was off the Ramblas, going towards the Port, Teatre place and called La Fonda. It was very popular and we had to wait for a table despite it being on 3 levels. We had a 3 course meal each, a jug of sangria and teas and coffees and the total cost was e35! It was not a fixed menu like a lot of restaurants in the area and the food was fresh, excellently presented and the staff were lovely. To travel around we would recommend the tourist bus which has 3 lines, red, blue and green for 19e for 1 day, 24e for 2 days, rather than the Barcelona bus which has just the one route. You also get a booklet of vouchers which gives you money off entrance fees etc. We would also recomend a visit to Monserat, a fantastic place. We decided to do the trip on our own and bought a ticket from tourist information for 29e which included, metro, train, funiculars, cable cars, all entrance fees and lunch in the self service restaurant at Monserat.. This worked out half the price for a half day tour and was easy to do on your own. Considering my mum is 73, she says she would recomend the hotel to her friends as it was centrally located, the staff were nice and after a busy day walking around the sights of Barcelona, all you want to do is sleep in a bed before you start again the next day. If you want to pay a lot more money and have 5* accomodation, then do not stay at this hotel, but if you are looking for a central location and are happy to have basic room with breakfast my Mum and I would recomend the Nouvel Hotel.", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England Cheshunt", "Title": "\u201cOld but clean\u201d", "Author": "EnglandCheshuntAngie", "ReviewID": "UR7803118", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Nouvel from 1st to 4th June, I read that the hotel was one of the oldest in barcelona with original features, and this was true the hotel was tired and dated and could do with some modernisation.

Breakfast was continental , you wont get a hot cup of tea as the water urn was luke warm every morning and the coffee was very strong.

Basically if you want to experience Barcelona like a real European, stay at this hotel. When we arrived we were placed in a twin room with the beds pushed together (meaning one massive bed!), and not one but two quant shuttered balconette windows looking out onto the side street the entrance of the hotel was off of. The bathroom was big enough and there was an English speaking (albeit American) news channel on television (what else do you really need?). The room was spotless, and remained so for the stay as the cleaners did an excellent job. The breakfast was authentic European, with croissants, pastries, toast, fruit, cereal, juice, tea and coffee with some scrambled eggs and sausages if you wished to have them.We mainly just pigged out on everything in readiment for a long day pounding the pavements! There is a bakery directly opposite the hotel entrance that serves excellent baguette sandwiches for you to pack for lunch on the run, and then of course you only need to walk to the end of the road in one direction and you are on Las Ramblas (the main shopping and cafe street) or the other direction and you are in the heart of the Gothic quater with its tiny shutter lined streets, cool clothes shops and restaurants. There is a metro station about a five minute walk away at the top of Las Ramblas that takes you to all the major sights, so of course the location of the hotel is second to none, The best thing about this hotel is the fact that a) it looks so cool and gothic all throughout from the lobby, to the creaky old lift, to the reception and b) the service we recieved from all the staff was friendly and courteous (which I hate to admit you don't expect in busy European city hotels). I probably wouldnt recommend this hotel in the height of summer simply for the fact the rooms don't have minibars for water bottles, and personally if I want a summer holiday I like staying at beach resorts with a swimming pool but for sheer romance this hotel cannot be beaten if you want a culture packed, relaxing city-break.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel redefines bare minimum\u201d", "Author": "H00sier", "ReviewID": "UR7266712", "Content": "If you want a bed in a good location at a moderately high price with little else added this is your hotel.

The location is outstanding for the price we paid - just \u00a370 per room per night- as the Ave. St Anna is only 500 yards from the Placa de Catalunya and right in between Las Ramblas and the Ave De L'Angels so you are extremely well placed for all the hustle and bustle of the main drag but at the same time peaceful once inside this lovely Art Nouveau hotel. Our twin bedded (smoking) room on the 1st floor was enormous. The space between our beds and the dressing table was the size of an average dance floor! The bathroom was a decent size and the shower was mighty powerful. There was plenty of drawer space and a double wardrobe with a safe. Satellite TV was a bit limited for us, in that there was only CNN in English but apart from that, everything was just fine. We even had a decent sized balcony, though as it was winter we didn't spend much time on there! The breakfast was perfectly adequate with plenty of tea & coffee, bread for toasting, croissants, cheese,ham, yoghurts, cereals and fruits as well as hot scrambled eggs and sausages. Enough for all tastes we thought and open until a very civilized 10.30am. The reception staff were very welcoming, knowledgeable and user friendly. We would most certainly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona.", "Date": "December 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cSewerage pipes\u201d", "Author": "RatPack", "ReviewID": "UR6127491", "Content": "We have a large family room, which was much bigger than the other membesr of our party.

You have to pay deposit for tv remote and generally the reception staff were not very friendly. Was recommended to a Flamenco Night. They obviously get a commission for selling the tickets. It cost \u20ac120 per couple, and the food was very dis-appointing, but not as dis-appointing as the dancing. Definitely not worth the money. The location of the hotel is great, however, but there are other hotels very close by with better accomodation and facilities.

The breakfast was ok, coffee and croissants were good but avoid the hot stuff, looked pretty sad and dried out to me, Reception staff were really helpful, especially Robert who tried to help me with the phone card I had bought, Dont buy one.. they dont work, you dial the number to activate it and its always engaged. theres a Supermarket on the Ramblas and you can buy a litre bottle of water for 39c.

If you get the airport link bus it drops you off two minuets away ! it is right in the centre of the city so you can walk anywhere. It also has balconies on the room ours looked over the side street and was great for people watching, we even saw a parade from it ! The city is great must see segrada familia, casa balato and the cathedral v. near hotel( remeber to take a cover up for shoulders and legs) . Also the hard rock cafe is Great esp for teenagers who love music, though go in early as you have to wait for your table. Now on to the bad dun dun dun ! .... The Bathroom was nasty there were hairs from previous guests all over the floor, the mother did not like it! On our floor lobby, flowers were in a make shift vase a water bottle!! The hotel was very smoky also. it was dissapointing because the lobby ect looks great in the photos. Also there can be some noise from outside and the bin men come very early.Las ramblas can become nasty after a few days , the restarants that line it con you into litre glasses of drinks which cost a small fortune although they are fun before you realise the price. I recomend resaurants down sidestreets which have more charcter and are more relxed.I have also heard horror stories of bag stealers on las ramblas esp ppl who come on scooters and grab it , so keep a tight hold! ******On the plus though, on the street with the wax measuemum there is one of the best pubs in barcelona! It is themed like an enchanted forest with a running waterfall , trees oo it was soo much fun and very cool which was great in the heat - you shld go there it was fab ! ******* Also the waffles near the beach are good, also the market has great fruit which is good for a cheap lunch .

Having read mixed reviews on Trip Advisor, I wasn't sure what I'd find! However, I can't really find any fault with the hotel. In terms of location, you couldn't ask for more. As this was my first visit to the city, I wanted to be in the heart of things, and just off the Las Ramblas was ideal. Ok, perhaps in some areas the hotel may need updating, but everything is kept very clean. I admit, we were lucky with our room, as we were at the back of the hotel. I didn't find it particularly noisy, and had 4 pleasant nights' sleep! But, as I say, it may have been different if I had a room at the front of the hotel. Yes, the room is basic - but these people who expect real luxury, aren't prepared to pay 5-star prices. The bathroom looked like it had recently been decorated, and new double-glazed windows were installed. All clean, and the maids were very pleasant. As for the staff at reception, I could not have asked for them to be more helpful and friendly. Any questions we had, they were always on hand to answer. The breakfast was good - with a full day's sight-seeing ahead, needed to fill myself up! Fruit, croissants, toast, rolls, jams, salami, ham, cheese, etc. Also, some hot food available, too.

We booked the hotel before checking Trip Advisor & were worried about the paper-thin walls etc mentioned in some of the reviews. Armed with earplugs just in case we arrived at the hotel and were met by very friendly staff. We had asked for a twin room when we booked just to give us more room, as we are not small people. The lady asked us if a double room was ok and foolishly we said yes. It was ok but the bad was very small, my partner is 6'3\" so his legs and feet hung over at the bottom of the bed. The floor was not very clean as it had hairs from the previous occupant over the bathroom floor. They were cleaned up the next day. The view was not great as we were at the back so we overlooked another room, which was two meters away. Long corridors with hard surfaces create the noise, which amplifies the sound, other hotels guests slamming doors and shouting till the early hours were a problem until the earplugs went in! I never heard a thing after and slept like a baby possibly due to the amount of walking I did during the day. Most of the noise transfers from pipes and air conditioning units as they are all interlinked. We realised this when the guy next door was trying to open a bottle of beer on the radiator, at first we thought it was someone trying to send a Morse code message! The best thing in the room was the shower having read other reviews I was looking forward to it. The showerhead did not look too great but the water pressure was. The bedroom on the photo of the hotel is nothing like the bedroom we had, we later learnt that this is on the top floor, the hotel could do with updating all of it's bedrooms, however a quick glance into another room on the same floor showed us a twin room which was in much better condition than ours. The hotel was easy to find and it is just off Las Ramblas & in excellent location very close to all shops and easy walking distance to all areas. Corte Ingles (big department store which sells everything) is at one end of the street whilst Las Ramblas is at the other. Local transport is great, bus and tube are both very easy systems to understand & ticket machines are in several languages. I would go back to Barcelona as it is an excellent city and the people are very friendly especially if you speak a little Spanish which did help with the restaurant staff who did need to take a happy pill as one person said but were friendly enough once I spoke to them. Breakfast was also great with very fresh produce. I would also stay at the hotel again as overall it was adequate enough for the price and location but I would be more choosy about the room & would ask to see it in advance of accepting it.", "Date": "May 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Jess099", "ReviewID": "UR5033344", "Content": "This is perfect spot to be staying in the hub of it all, yet down a traditional side street with plenty of atmosphere & not the huge bussle of the ramblas.
