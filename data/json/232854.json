Central hotels are easily too expensive. The alternative is to stay outside the centre but somewhere with good transport links. The Cilicia fits the latter category. On the one hand, the metro is too far out to be counted on, it\u2019s a good 20 minute walk up the street, hardly worth the hassle. The bus network though is likely to be your best friend while staying at the Cilicia. Here are tips for the 3/4 buses you should keep in mind, departing from Piazza Zama which is a 5 minute walk up from the hotel: 360 brings you to the Colosseum area 673 brings you to Termini 628 to the Piazza Venezia / Argentina / Piazza Navona area (maybe even the Vatican if you are willing to endure the 15 minute walk from there) and ultimately goes to Giardino which is a 5 minute walk from the Ponte della Musica which you should cross to visit the MAXXI Modern Art Museum and the Auditorium (Music). However be careful regarding the \"return leg\" as during my stay (late Oct.'11) 628 could not be relied on to come back (it was so infrequent bordering on non-existent!); a good alternative if you're in the city centre is bus 87 which is frequent and comes through Argentina to Piazza Venezia and brings you to Piazza Tuscolo, an easy 10 minutes walk up the road from the hotel (hence a descent when coming back from downtown in the evening or night). In the morning you should count on 45-50 mins door to door from hotel to city centre if you're going by bus. Do keep in mind that traffic in Rome is hectic, what looks like a relatively short distance can take some time to cover. Also, during rush hours buses can be absolutely packed! As for nearby restaurants, right next to Piazza Tuscolo is a nice place called Mangiafuoco with decent prices (15 to 20 Eur per person) and good food. But there are few decent places to eat close to hotel, you're better off dining in the city centre (Campo dei Fiori and surroundings, for instance). For any die hard AS Roma fans out there though the most fanatical of Roma caf\u00e9/restaurants sits 100 metres from the hotel, Co re Di Roma it\u2019s called (when exiting the hotel to the right, take the first left then the first right). As for location positives: it\u2019s rather close to an entrance to the Via Appia Antica and apparently the info. point is rather close by (unfortunately I missed the opportunity to see it). It\u2019s simple enough: exit to the left of the hotel and walk Via Cilicia for some 200 metres, an exit to the right descending from Via Cilicia onto the Via Appia Antica. Rooms are comfortable and large enough (sorry that I didn\u2019t take any pictures, but the hotel pictures can be relied upon). Breakfast is simple as it tend to be in Rome hotels of this standard, but it's just enough. For the price I paid (just under 70 Eur per night per room incl. breakfast for 2) I have no complaints really. I got what I expected and I consider it very good value. If you plan on leaving the hotel in the morning and to come back late in the evening or night, you know what to expect and you will be fine. If it\u2019s your first time in Rome you may be a little frustrated at the location and prefer somewhere more central - your pick. If you\u2019ve been to Rome though and willing to endure a bit of walking (as you should in Rome, it's a walker's city by excellence) and public transportation it\u2019s absolutely fine and you will relish the money that you saved on the lodging.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely valentine's stay\u201d", "Author": "dimithri1974", "ReviewID": "UR103862482", "Content": "Lovely Hotel with a beautiful big room....Beautifully decorated ,old style...minor breakages which can be easily sorted....but very roomy with a nice big wardrobe, mini fridge, side tables and lamps, and desk with large mirrors.

The only complaint I would have is that it's a bit far from the city centre. Definitely not walking distance although there is a metro station close by. I would suggest studying the metro system in advance if you are staying here, it will save you a lot of time and money. Oh and although most rooms have balconies, there is one room in the hotel on the corner that has a huge rooftop terrace that is only accessible to those people staying in that room...The view is amazing!!!!! It has two double beds and one is in a closed off room...Our group was upgraded to this room at no charge (I think because they were at capacity) and it was a great perk to the stay...

I agree that transportation can be a small problem on the first day. The metro station is 20 minutes walking, but it is a pleasant walk, we didn't mind. The only thing was that the line closed early due to constuctions in the station, so coming back was a bid of a problem. There is at least one bus that leaves from Termini station (last one at 00.30) and stops almost in front of the hotel. Taxis on Saturday night is a problem... and due to the traffic it can cost a lot. The only thing we didn't like much were the receptionists attitude. Not very polite nor helpful. They made us feel as we were bothering them with our questions, and their english, well some of them could use some extra lessons.

This is a mid class hotel with about 40 rooms. The double room we stayed in was small but well equipped and furnished, with controllable AC, cable and a bathroom/shower. Rooms and hotel were very clean, staff speaks reasonable English and was generally helpful. Complimentary breakfast was more than decent, including fresh rolls, coffee, cereal, fruit and bread. Main disadvantage is the hotel location: although near Rome's center the nearest subway station is about 1.5 kilometers away. There is a bus stop (bus 360) about 100 mtrs down the street, with about 2 busses/hr from Termini (4 kilometers from hotel). If you need to return to the hotel frequently during daytrips I would not recommend this hotel. If you plan to use it for sleeping and breakfast only it's more than fine.
