The same can be said about the food. While I am fine with a room that is adequate, my expectations in the food department are a little higher. However, I did like their black bean soup. I had it twice. The breakfast that came with the free breakfast coupon was very adequate. Service was good, friendly and unpretentious. Just helpful. At the reception desk, in the bar and in the dining room. The wireless internet is free. And you get what you don't pay for. Forget about watching a news video clip in total before you fall asleep.

My GPS unit did not recognize it, so I entered just any old address in Ponce, hoping that I would have better luck once I got here. Of course I didn't.

The Holiday Inn & Casino in Ponce is located on a hill overlooking the ocean and near the main highway.

The beds and pillows were very comfortable and there is a large flat screen TV with lots of channels to choose from. The bathroom was modern and a good size. Not much hanging space, but there is a little refrigerator and good drawer space. The hotel has a fairly large casino, restaurant and large bar. We were given a complimentary drink and a $10 matching bet, although we did not gamble. The pool is very large and has lots of patio area and seating around it, plus there is also more patio and seating area above the pool.

We took a cab into the town square of Ponce and walked around (sidewalks rolled up at 6pm!) and your cab driver gave us his personal cell so you can call them back to get you after you are finished.....but really the best part was the outstanding ( and VERY reasonable) roomservice breakfast brought to you on a rolling table and a second cup of coffee on your private balcony overlooking the ocean.... and then a day lounging by the pool......There is a casino , music, and a bar in the hotel.

We were told in Mayaguez that the hotels were owned by the same owner. This property is in many ways a twin to the Mayaguez......same carpeting in the hallways.....same furniture and similar menus in the restaurant. I think I prefer the Mayaguez property for the following reason: The hotel, although attached to the Casino, seems more separated in Mayaguez than in Ponce.....the lobby in Mayaguez is somewhat isolated from the Casino, so the entrance is more pleasant. In Ponce a lot of the Casino traffic is moving in the lobby and creates a bit more of a chaotic feel to it.....no big deal....but not pleasing to this traveler. The guest rooms in both hotels are nicely appointed and maintained. The restaurant in Mayaguez is more professionally served than in Ponce. The food is each is fine. These Holiday Inn properties are really better than the average of those that will be generally be found in the mainland of the US. One comment on the Ponce property......the flushing of the toilets makes one a little nervous......the water pressure seems a little low.....when flushing the water rises to the top of the bowl before finally and slowing receding.....sometimes requires more than one flush to complete the job.....makes you wonder if the thing is going to overflow.....but it did not. Sorry to be so graphic......but generally these kinds of toilet facilities make one a bit uneasy. Really.....this is a well run hotel and is worth a stay.

My girlfriend and I laid out with fantastic weather one day, not one other person on the pool which was fine by us.

The casino and club clients always had the parking lot packed. You had to walk to the end of the earth to get parking, and that really stinks after a day of traveling and touring the island. Do not stay here, the only rooms with a view are the ones facing the pool. You can find better hotels and if you have a choice stay in San Juan. We spent a day there and it is beautiful and you will pay the same price or even less for a nicer hotel on the beach.", "Date": "August 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cAn Average stay....\u201d", "Author": "Jinx*Ya", "ReviewID": "UR17879999", "Content": "The location is nice on a hill top that was nice.

Check-in was flawless. The bilingual staff was very helpful and accomodating. Free breakfast and drink coupons were provided on account of our Priority Club status. Our room was nothing fancy, but it overlooked the Caribbean. Couldn't ask for more than that! Watched a picture-perfect sunset from our balcony. The double beds were a little small for us, and just ok from a comfort standpoint. The bathroom functioned as it should, and the amenities were standard Holiday Inn issue. The towels were not so great. Like drying off with sandpaper. These could use improvement! We took advantage of the very neat and clean pool area. The water was cool, but extremely clean and otherwise pleasant. There were not many people around, so you could really relax. It's probably not always like that, but on our two days here, it was. One complaint - the lounge chairs were a little stained, like yours probably get at home. I think it's probably time to replace some of them. The continental breakfast in the Club Room in the mornings consisted of fresh fruit, cereal, breads, coffee/tea and juice. It was all very nice, and the attendant was a sweetheart. I enjoyed reading the complimentary Enlish-language Puerto Rican newspaper while having my coffee. I don't gamble, so I can't really comment on the casino area here. Parking is plentiful and free. We took all our other meals in town, so we didn't try the on-site restaurant. Overall, I think this was a good choice for us on our trip to Ponce. This hotel is on the western edge of the city (quite easy to find), not downtown, but it is only a short drive to get there. If you don't have a car here, I am not sure what you would do. The hotel could probably stand some updating in terms the physical plant, but not so much that it would put me off staying here again.

This was the worst Holiday Inn that we've stayed at on a vacation. The Holiday Inn Express in San Juan is a far better hotel in terms of service and amentities than this one, and it's far cheaper. There are no transportation services to/from airport or surrounding sites and no tours to sign up for even though there are plenty of sites to see in the area. My room was serviced only once during our 3 day visit. When I complained, towels were left on the bed. The dirty towels stayed on the floor in the bathroom, and the bed was not made. Even though we're members of Priority Club, we weren't told that breakfast was complementary until we overheard someone talking about it on our last day. However, you are given $10 in casino money for certain tables, and 2 drink tickets. If you want a great time in Ponce, go to the Hilton on the beach. They offer tours and transportation. If you're planning to see San Juan, the Holiday Inn Express in Condado is relatively inexpensive, has complementary continental breakfast, and offers tours to sites around the island including El Yunque, kayaking in the bay, and the beaches. BUT, has NO PARKING, otherwise check out the Comfort Inn across the street. They offer parking for $10/day and are relatively inexpensive. If you want a great time in the rainforest, stay at Casa Cubuy and take a rainforest hike with Robin Philips. This B&B is wonderful (not a 5 star resort, but a great family atmosphere, great scenery, and very private).
