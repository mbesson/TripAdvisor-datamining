Well informed and friendly. The biggest let down was the breakfast. There was no real food. The eggs were powered, the waffles tasted of bitter chemicals from the spray you needed to use on the waffle maker. No real milk and powered tang instead of orange juice. The apples were rotten on the inside even though they looked perfect on the outside. The bananas were under ripe and crunchy even though again they were perfect on the outside. Go to Wholefoods instead for your meals which is on the way back to Westlake Center. The cheapest way to and from the airport is definitely the train. It's only $2.50 per person to Westlake Center.

The hotel offers breakfast which can be jam packed with people and kids, but it has better than average selections (hot and cold plates). The lobby is very recently updated, well done. The rooms are beginning to show their age and the lighting is a bit low. The bed was fine, I felt the sheets were a bit on the cheap side. Everything was clean and as I expected. If your expecting a full service hotel in downtown, this hotel is a compromise. The area is a bit off to the side and can be noisy due to the proximity to I5 and the ramps to it.

Not much around the Hotel to tour, (subway across the street). Not a bad neighborhood....I think the Hotel does their best to control the homeless around the area.

The hotel offers shuttle services to down town area, but we did not reserve ahead of time, so no more space for return service. So we ended walk back to the hotel from downtown (around 5th and pine street). It took about 15 minutes walk which is okay with us. Overall, I have no major problem with this hotel, just feel this hotel lacks of attention to the details and if this trend continues, the condition of this hotel can be pretty bad.

Most of my reviews are preceded by counsel for third-party (e.g. Priceline) guests. That counsel has been omitted here. APRIL 2010 PLUS: Room refrigerator had been preset at a reasonable level. Hot water ran quickly. Large, very spacious room with separate living and sleeping sections. Separate bath and vanity area. MINUS: heat and cool control easy to find on wall, but with print on controls so tiny it is barely legible. A wall sign would help. System works well but is very slow to respond. Very centrally located; hourly shuttle and nearly public transportation makes moving about easy. Suggestion: tip the shuttle drivers; they can be very helpful. Avoid a car--and if you have guests, use inexpensive self-pay lot next door or street parking--street free after 6 and on weekends, as all over Seattle. Breakfast space becomes a kitchen for lunch and dinner, but there were so few customers that it can be difficult to get attention. Front desk interaction is necessary for small purchases and is always busy with counseling about how-to-get-where. Polite but can involve long, long waits. Help yourself when possible. APRIL 2009 PLUS: Breakfast buffet: hot eggs and meats, yogurts in two sizes and including low-carb, breads, muffins, make-own waffles, hard eggs, potatoes, hot oatmeal and toppings, cold cereals and juices; excellent coffee/tea in breakfast room and lobby (24 hours). Totally non-smoking, like all Marriotts. Open business center with two-computers and a printer for each, off lobby. Flawless free wired and wireless internet in rooms, wireless in lobby. Newspaper outside door on weekdays, in lobby on weekends. Inside pool and hot tub. Free access to huge 24-hour fitness across the street. Starbucks (closed weekends) across the street.

The giant, rally giant flagship REI and upscale shops (and BLIX, probably one of Seattle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best spa spaces) one block walk.

Recent (fabulous) lobby, breakfast room and bar renovation. Exceptionally helpful and friendly employees. Quiet despite extreme proximity to freeway. Coin laundry with several machines for guests, 2nd floor; $1 each wash and dry when I was there. Priceline 2.5 or 3-star, South Lake Union, $65-72 in winter/spring (desk was quoting $109 to walk-ins one day of my stay); higher in summer/fall. Hotel is owned by a TX company but Marriott-branded; in most of these hotels, Marriott provides management training and staff is well-trained. MINUS: Constant traffic on Yale Avenue can make vehicle exit risky and difficult. At all costs avoid driving at commuter hours (morning or 3-6). Valet and front desk folks will make route suggestions. Starbucks closed on weekends. Unclear how to retrieve messages from room telephone. Breakfast room can be very crowded; to avoid this go early, and avoid late hours. Room refrigerator not easily set and was extremely cold; it froze fruit, water and flowers!

Was in town for some sightseeing with a friend who'd never been to Seattle before, and this hotel was a good \"home base\" despite it being a short walk away from the tourist core. Friendly and attentive staff, modern, trendy, aquatic look throughout the main floor, and the lounge/bar was well attended by people wining and dining. Taxis took forever to arrive each time we'd asked the front desk staff to call one for us. Later we realized it's because they have a contract with the orange cabs only! Call a yellow cab from your room, or insist the staff call them for you. I found they were faster to arrive than the orange company (maybe they have more cars?). Location was fine. We took Howell St (Olive turns into it if you're coming from downtown) to and from the hotel during the day and night. Never felt vulernable or nervous, the area is pretty quiet, just parkades and office buildings in the immediate neighbourhood. That being said, we found the nearby Habesha restaurant to be our favourite place of the trip! We'd never tried Eithiopian food before, and this place was fantastic. Classy, great staff, dim lighting, nice ambiance, and AMAZING FOOD. Highly recommend starting with the Selata (salad) and sharing the chicken and lamb entrees. The hotel's breakfast buffet significantly exceeded our expectations. I'd never been to a hotel where their waffles are any more than toaster eggos, frozen belgiums, or the like. Springhill Suites had a separate station set up with batter, hot waffle irons (with clear DIY instructions), strawberries (in syrup), cans of whipped cream, and syrup. The rest of the buffet was hot and standard, with cereals, scrambled eggs, sausages, home fries, condiments/hot sauces, oatmeal, baked goods (bagels, muffins, scones, cinnamon buns, bread, etc), fresh raw fruit (whole oranges and apples), individual yogurts, and juice. Lots of seating. The only place in seattle I've found that has free breakfast. Saved us a ton of money. What else...the room! We had a King Suite and found it fine. Nothing special, lots of space. We had a room right beside the freeway, request one away from here (if they have any?). No mirror in the bathroom/shower area. It's in the separate sink area. Good I guess if someone's having a shower, and someone else wants to get ready. Free internet was a plus! Follow the instructions on the desk. Overall, I'd stay here again.

The hotel was recently renovated, so the lobby, bar & restaurant areas were pleasing to the eye. The rooms were nice as well, but they were definitely basic/bare bones. The free continental breakfast was great, but the food at the restaurant for lunch, dinner and room service was just mediocre. Worth it to eat there at the bar for reduced price bar snacks/light bites during happy hour, but would not recommend eating there otherwise for the price.

You can tell that they have tried hard to make this hotel better. The decor in the common areas was very pleasant/modern, and the space did seem quite clean/well-maintained. However, I felt that the management missed the mark on several key issues. Most obviously, they had NO idea whatsoever that there was a marathon in the city that weekend, and offered no service to the hundreds of runners that were staying at the hotel. It seems insane that they would not have known such a major event was taking place. The hotel typically runs a \"convenience shuttle\" to other nearby areas of the city (basically designed to prevent you from walking around the less-than-desirable neighborhood where it's located), but refused to run the shuttle once earlier in the morning on race day to get runners (who had to head to the race area before daybreak) to the race area. This seemed like a very major miss, and a sign of bigger things that were lacking as far as the management of the establishment. Overall, I will say that they tried hard, were willing to work with the guests, and very pleasant.

The hotel is not in the center of downtown Seattle, but more on the outside of the city, next to Interstate 5. That was not a problem for me, especially since the price for most downtown hotels is more than double or triple what I paid. Even at this location, we were more than able to walk to Seattle Center, Pike Place Market and the waterfront within 20-30 minutes or so. The hotel has a shuttle that picks up hourly from several places downtown which we took back to the hotel after navigating the downtown area. We stayed at this hotel the night before heading to Victoria, British Columbia, on the Victoria Clipper. We were able to drive from the hotel to the Clipper dock at Pier 69 within 15 minutes easily. The room was incredibly clean and spacious. I had requested a King room, but was given a double queen, which is not a big deal. The sitting area was large, with a comfortable couch, microfridge and microwave. The bed was comfortable, with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was spacious and exceptionally clean. The Neutrogena bath products were very nice. Another perk of the hotel is that there is a 24 hr fitness gym across the street which allows hotel guests entry. I did not use the gym, but it looked nice from outside. The downsides to this hotel is that it was next to the interstate and traffic was very loud. If you require a quite room, this is not the place for you. Also, the hotel is not that easy to find because of several one way streets. Thankfully I had a GPS. Another downside is that since it is on the outskirts, there are not many places to walk to have dinner or lunch. The area seems to be an area that is slowly building up and in a few years will probably have many places, but the closest place to eat was Paddy Coynes Irish Pub about 3 or 4 blocks away.

Our room was really nice (we asked for one away from the freeway after reading reviews here earlier) and it was still a bit noisy, but hey, it's the city. It felt like a deluxe room, considering the reasonable price, with nice bedding and even art on the walls that we really liked. We could even see the Space Needle a bit from our window. The shuttle runs hourly, so it wasn't as though we could reserve it to go to a certain place at a certain time. But it worked out well for us, and when the shuttle missed us by just a minute when we needed to return from the Space Needle, they promptly paid our cab fare without my even having asked. We will definitely go back when we have a need to stay near downtown Seattle again.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bayside, New York", "Title": "\u201cSomething was not quite right\u201d", "Author": "Wyatt1970", "ReviewID": "UR6165901", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel while I attended a conference in Seattle from November 14, 2006 to November 18, 2006. I thought I was saving my company money by staying here rather than one of the hotels closer to the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, but in the end I spent the same amount of money it would have cost me to stay in a closer hotel. The biggest problem I had with this hotel is its location. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the Convention Center due to the construction and the traffic lights. Try doing this in the rain a few times and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see how much of a problem it is. Going to the Public Market and other tourist sites will require an even further walk. Expect to be very tired at the end of the day, especially if you are traveling here from the East Coast like I was. Be careful with the valet parking. I woke up on the third day of the conference to drive my wife back to the airport. When I went to pick up my car, the valet came back and told me that my car had a flat tire. I am rather suspicious about how that could have happened. We did not run over anything during our drive from the rental car office to the hotel, and there were no apparent problems with the tires when we picked up the car. I have no way of proving if the valets caused the flat, but I am peeved that no one noticed the flat until I had to go pick up the car. Just imagine if I had discovered this on the day I was supposed to leave Seattle! As it was, I barely got any time to visit the Space Needle after waiting for roadside assistance to fix the flat. I also had to shell out an additional $30 to get my wife to the airport via taxi. The breakfasts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad when you consider that they are included in the price of your room. I would be more disappointed with them if I had to pay an additional fee for them. The potatoes were usually lukewarm and the pancakes and french toast had that institutional taste. They also pre-measure waffle batter for the make-your-own waffle bar, but many days the amount of batter they gave you was not enough to make a complete waffle. I also had an issue with the housekeeping. I returned to my room at the end of the day, only to find that the glasses in the bathroom had not been cleaned. I know this because my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lipstick was still on one of the glasses! It was things like these that gave me an uneasy feeling about this hotel. All in all, I have to say that I was disappointed with this hotel. It was not a bad experience, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to the high quality I have come to expect from Marriott Hotels.", "Date": "November 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ventura, CA", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing Stay in Seattle\u201d", "Author": "SPCTCC", "ReviewID": "UR6032294", "Content": "Nothing fancy, in fact a bit cramped, not well laid out and located out of the way.

It was easy to find, and just off the freeway. This hotel was walking distance to the best part of Seattle, the shopping district and Pike Place Market. Had the Monorail been running, it also would have been easy to access the Space Needle! The room and decor was immaculate and stylish and huge. The \"Continental Breakfast\" was included in the price, and though we didn't partake, as we only had one night's stay and we wanted something with a little more \"kitsch\", I did get to see the spread, and it looked a little bit better than the average continental. We went to a show at the Paramount Theatre, and walked back to the hotel late at night without any worries, though it is in kind of a quiet business district so there aren't many people around. We're not really the kind of people to spend a lot of time in a hotel room, so if you like a spectacular view or whatever, this might not be the hotel for you, but if you want a clean, reasonably priced hotel with great friendly staff and a good location, stay here.

See other reviews for room details, but there is a glaring, unforgiveable problem: The hotel sits right next to Interstate 5 (which, if you know Seattle is busy almost 24 hours a day) and the road noise is horrendous. I asked to be moved from my room to a quieter one and the desk agent assured me that the room was the quietest in the hotel. This is unforgiveable for modern, very nice hotel to have scrimped on noise insulation when next to a freeway.
