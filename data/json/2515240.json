Well!!!!! you guessed it She was not joking (obviously knew abot this problem)!. Returning to our room the hall smelt better. THEY CONTINUED TO SPRAY DURING OUR VISIT!!!!!

The choice of hotel was more for the location rather than anything else. However on arrival I was pleasantly surprised. The reception staff were lovely - friendly and helpful. We upgraded our room for 20 euros/night extra and got one of the superior rooms on the ninth floor. Great views across Paris to the Sacre Coeur and over the rooftops. The room itself was a little more stylish than your standard business hotel with a decent bathroom, good TV and coffee maker. I can't really comment about breakfast as we didn't eat there though it seemed pricey especially when there is a great Gontran Cherrier bakery up the road (just past the cemetery) which does excellent coffee and pastries. The location is perfect for Montmatre and the Metro though we walked everywhere. The stretch around the Moulin Rouge is very touristy (think Times Square NYC or Leicester Square London) with little to see although come away a few streets and there are some decent cafes and bistros. I wonder if the standard rooms might be a bit small and my only gripe was that the rooms were a bit stuffy in the night and if you're a light sleeper you might not want the window open with the bustling road outside. So if you can get a deal and get a room on the 9th floor you'll be doing well for your money.

We stayed in a superior / privilege room on the 8th floor. It was clean and modern, although my partner thought it was lacking in soul. Even the air-conditioning worked (although it could have been a bit cooler for my tastes). It was spotlessly clean but there was no cupboard/drawer space \u2013 just an open closet area. For a Paris hotel, it was a reasonable size. I found the large bed and pillows very, very comfortable. The shower strength was very good, although due to the bath/shower design, the water leaked all over the place. Good thing I asked for extra towels on arrival. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the toilet is in a separate cubicle. As we were in a privilege room, bathrobes and slippers were provided along with an espresso pod machine and a small fridge containing complimentary soft drinks \u2013 1 bottle of still, 1 bottle of sparkling, 1 bottle of orange juice, 1 can of coke, 1 can of Diet Coke. I liked the quality of the bathroom amenities. The staff were very welcoming and accommodating and seemed genuinely concerned about our stay. It is a short walk to lots of restaurants, bars and shopping areas \u2013 the location is excellent. However, do not under any expenses pay extra for the breakfast, unless you can get a good B&B rate. It nearly ruined what could have been a near-perfect stay. The breakfast room was chaos. There were too few staff tending to the needs of their guests. The food was average to poor quality at best and there was a huge line to get coffee or tea -- it was a mad scrum. The hotel didn\u2019t seem that busy during our stay so the lack of preparation was alarming -- I'm afraid my overall rating dropped because of this.

It's also close to many cute restaurants just up Rue Caulaincourt. The hotel's lobby needs to be updated, as it is not as stylish as the newly renovated rooms (floors 4 and up). The front desk staff was excellent, especially a young woman named Marion who was very cheerful and helpful. The check in was quick and effecient. The room was very clean and modern, and everything was recently renovated. The ONLY complaint I have about the room is the hair dryer!

I made all the payments and thought everything was sorted. When I arrived at the hotel they informed me that the rooms on the top floors are \"Premium\" whereas my room was \"Standard\" and that if I wanted a room on the top floors I'd need to pay 50 Euro per night extra. I was appalled, not least because none of that was mentioned when I was making my bookings. I also made sure my request went in writing to them a month in advance, surely at some point in that month they would have found the decency to inform me of that. Even if that were not to happen, at least offer me some sort of concession when I arrive at the hotel! Instead, they put me in the worst room possible, on the first floor near the breakfast room overlooking some kebab shop, from what I can see, because a wall was almost half way up the window. It's right on the street so it's loud and busy, just horrible. Now Im not one to complain about small stuff here and there, I find people to do that to be quite pedantically irritating, but my room was just all over the place. The toilet wasn't even one room! The toilet and showers were in separate rooms! The toilet didn't even have basic things like toilet paper! After the cleaning lady cleaned the room, she forgot not only forgot to replace the towels, but also no soaps and shampoo! Cleanliness wasn't great either, the hallways had bad smells throughout, especially that I'm close to the kitchen, the place smelled of cookery and oils at all times! Location-wise, you should know that this building is quite literally on the border between Montmartre and Opera, I wouldn't classify it as Montmartre. The basilica is a good 15-20 minute steep hill walk away. The area is very dirty, which is expected, I mean we are talking about Boulevard Clichy here, don't expect this to be Montmartre proper, it's on the border, but you don't me to tell you that, just grab a map. I just think this place lacked basic courtesy to it's guests. Okay, so my room is standard, and I didnt even know, that's not the problem, but they could offer alternatives, and no paying 50 euros a night is not one that I consider to be courteous! The only good thing about the place for me was the free wifi at all times, which was pleasant, but I wouldn't recommend that place to anyone, just bad treatment, I certainly won't be coming back to any mercure hotel any time soon!", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood weekend stay\u201d", "Author": "AWal02", "ReviewID": "UR125468868", "Content": "We loved the location of this hotel the buzz around moulin rouge in the evenings is amazing!

The hotel is clean and spacious. Our room (on the 4th floor) is newly remodeled and handsome. The bed is hard but not uncomfortable. The Internet is quite good. The room is quiet. Having done our homework before we came, we knew the neighborhood was a bit dodgy, and expected that. The quick subway ride into downtown makes that a minor annoyance. The nearby restaurants we've tried so far have been adequate, but not much more. I'm not especially impressed by any of them. The breakfast is unusual for a Paris hotel. It's obvious they cater to a lot of Brits and Americans, because it's far more robust than what Parisians usually eat. There's cheese and yogurt; a good selection of fresh fruit; bacon, sausage, and eggs; a choice of cereals; and an assortment of breads and croissants that were quite good. Our only complaint has to do with the service. The cleaning staff can't begin to keep up with the rate at which the tables turn over. As a result, the room always has either occupied tables or dirty tables, but no clean ones. This is a problem, because the table setup includes your utensils and coffee cup. If you can't find a clean table, you don't get either. We've taken to searching the dirty tables for unused cups and utensils so we can eat. (We've also resigned ourselves to pushing aside the dirty dishes so we can have a clear table to eat on. Once we sit down, the cleaners will not approach the table, so we're stuck with the pile of dirty dishes. Sooo appetizing.) The whole breakfast process is badly thought-out and badly managed, and needs to be reconsidered with an eye toward efficiency. Putting all cups, plates, and utensils on the buffet bar would be a strong start. Teaching the cleaners to work faster (there's room for improvement) would also help.

Overall, this was a decent place to stay. GOOD things- it was easy to drive to hotel/locate the hotel. There is a large parking garage right next to the hotel (expensive but worth it.) Quick walk to the Metro station- easy to ride and never felt unsafe riding all over the city. Never had to hire a taxi. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. Shower good and mini bar in room. Ice and vending machine not far. There is a small convenience/grocery store directly across the street from the hotel. Booked a rate through another website that included breakfast. Better rate than advertised by the hotel itself. Not the very best area of Paris but I never felt unsafe. Interesting, artsy area. One day we walked from the hotel to the Sacre Coure Cathedral - nice interesting walk and amazing view from the top of the church. BAD things-customer service is AWFUL. I asked for extra pillows and was told that I had to wait until the next day. When I told them that I specifically booked this chain/ a four star hotel in order to get things like EXTRA PILLOWS they decided to get a key to the maid's room and get my pillows. Simply ridiculous. One night the power was COMPLETELY OUT when my daughter and I returned to the hotel after dinner. Absolutely no lights/ no air conditioning. For some reason the elevators worked and we got out on our floor and made our way to the room. I used my cell phone in complete darkness as a flashlight to call the front desk. I asked about the power and was told that this had never happened before. I asked if there was a flashlight I could use and was told they would look and try to bring one. Never heard back. Not surprised. Again lousy, lousy customer service.Thank goodness it was not too hot to sleep. Sometime around 5:30 am the power went back on. Breakfast buffet was plentiful and decent but the breakfast room was like a cattle car. Much too crowded and not a nice ambiance at all. I would opt to forgo breakfast next time and get a croissant down the street.

If we were choosing the hotel we would probably pick a hotel more central to what we wanted to do in Paris. This hotel was very close to the Moulin Rouge/Pigalle and the Montmartre Area, but I we didn\u2019t spend six days in these days. We used the Place de Clichy metro stop daily and we had no problems (pickpockets, etc.) whether it was 8am or 11pm. Around the hotel there were many restaurants (we only ate at one \u2013 Creperie Pen-ty \u2013 best crepes in Paris!), currency exchanges, and stores (allowing us to buy a pack of water and keep it in our mini-frig in the room). Our room was on the sixth floor and had a nice view over Paris. It was very modern with a large enough bathroom, a nice wardrobe area, a mini-frig, a safe, and a coffee/tea station. There were plenty of outlets to charge our cameras and cell phones, and the beds were very comfortable. On our first night at the hotel, the entire building lost electricity making it impossible to shower and get ready for bed. The Wi-Fi connection at the hotel was great (other than you needed to get a new access code everyday) and made it possible to keep it touch with friends and family back home. The worst part of the hotel was the breakfast. Because we were with a tour group for breakfast we were placed in a \u201cspecial\u201d tour group breakfast with other tour groups (sometimes a total of 4 or 5 groups were in a little breakfast room). The breakfast food was generally non-existent, over-cooked, or under-cooked. All of the people in our group felt the same way, and by the last three nights we went to a few boulangeries and patisseries, bought orange juice at one of the nearby stores and ate breakfast in our room. Overall the hotel was good, with breakfast being the only bad thing. Nothing was horrible about this hotel but we would most likely not stay at this hotel again.

We travelled by RER and then metro from CDG airport, changing at Gare du Nord/La Chapelle. The hotel can be viewed immediately from leaving the Place de Clichy metro station. We were checked in quickly and our room was ready when arrived at around 5pm. We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room as we knew that hotel rooms could be small in Paris. The bathroom also had a good-sized bath. The beds were comfortable and there was enough storage for a stay of three nights. The bathroom came equipped with a hairdyer and toiletries. Our room was at the front of the hotel and the window looked onto the busy road however when the windows were closed we could hear hardly any noise. The hotel is quiet in the evenings and we had great sleeps. The hotel is at the bottom of the Montmartre hill and just off the Blvd de Clichy. The Pigalle red-light district is not far away and while this part of the street is undoubtedly seedy, it feels perfectly safe. A walk up the hill leads you to Montmartre with good shops and restuarants and of course, the Sacre Coeur. Opera and the Arc de Trimuphe are also in walking distance and the Place de Clichy metro station is well connected with sights across the city. This station feels safe in the evening. Overall, the hotel offered very good value for money through a hotels.com deal and we got a much larger and nicer room in Paris than we expected on our budget - even if this budget would have got us signifcantly more in any other city.

The Place de Clichy/Moulin Rouge/bar neighbourhood is a little sleazy, but if you veer away from that to Montmartre and the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur and you discover a whole new village atmosphere. Also i was a little concerned that the Mercure brand would mean the hotel was devoid of individual character. However, i was delighted with the choice. It is well worth paying a bit extra for the top floor privilege rooms which offer a simply stunning view over the rooftops of Paris and gives a few pleasing extras like espresso machine, complimentary soft drinks in fridge, bathrobes and late check-out as part of the 3 night package.

It took few days for the reservation department to reply my email and after the quotation of the current package. It took another few days for them to reply me with the bad new of fully book. Luckily at the end I managed to make the reservation through internet. The nightmare began when I check in the hotel. I had reserved 2 rooms for 4 days. 1 twin bed room and 1 king size bed room. However during the check-in, the staff informed me I reserved the twin bed room only and when I show her my confirmation, she just simply suggest me come back tomorrow for room change. I also work in the hotel industry and we also experience fully book. But when we see the reservation like this (1 king bed and 1 twin bed), we will believe it is a family booking and will not change the king size bed to twin bed room!! Breakfast did not have much choice and the food was not refill after finish. I totally regret I should use the money to have my breakfast outside! One day I was going to the front office to ask for late check out. Firstly, it was a mess in the lobby, nobody line up and people just rush to the counter once it was empty. I saw the front office manager was helping in the counter but he didn't try to organize and control the lobby crowd. At the end, I was able to be served by one of the front office staff. I told him I would like to have a late check out for tomorrow and he did not seem to know what is a late check out!!! After explaining him the situation he said he will leave a message. So the next day I went to the front office to confirm my late check out, the staff said he did not receive any information and he rudely said \"it is not my problem. You told the guy from yesterday and now it is me working\"! I was totally shocked with his attitude and disappointed with the communication of the front office team! During check out, I gave my Accor membership card to the staff and he said the system can not recognize the card (which it works perfectly during my stay in Mercure in Zurich). Then I told him my airline membership number. The staff insisted that he can only enter it to the system when he see the card.

Check in was a very smooth affair, quick and courteous, with very good English spoken by the young lady at reception (which was a positive, as my French is not good!). My room was immaculate, beautifully presented, modern and comfortable. The bed was large and very comfortable. The TV had the usual selection of local channels, with some European channels too. The bathroom was modern and again immaculate, with a great shower with good water pressure (very important in any hotel - you can't beat a great shower!) One slight moan about the room was that the air conditioning seemed largely inneffectual. Any movement on the control seemed to do very little and as a consequence, the room was quite hot throughout my stay. Nothing to get too worked up about though. The floor was quiet (5th floor) with very little noise from either the corridors or adjoining rooms - aiding a very good sleep. Breakfast was a buffet type affair, with a great selection of cold and cooked meats, fresh bread, coffee, tea and fruit juices. Also a good selection of yoghurts, pro-biotics and fresh fruit / cereal. We didn't eat our evening meal in the hotel, but there are very good restaurants within the local vicinity and the hotel is exceptionally close to the Place de Clichy metro stop, putting you litterally minutes away from some great restaurants (a 10 minute 1.50euro trip on the metro and we were at the Champs Elysees). The hotel is well located for ease of transport about central Paris. Yes, it's close to the red light district, but there were absolutely no problems either outside or directly around the hotel. Don't let this put you off staying here - one of the major attractions of Paris (the Moulin Rouge) is a 5 minute walk away, so don't be put off. A very pleasant and comfortable stay - wouldn't hesitate in recommending or staying here again for business or pleasure. One comment would be the constant hub-bub in reception - because there is a large proportion of tourists here, there are always coaches outside and lots of groups of tourists in reception - but this is expected for any hotel on the tourist trail.

Mercure should get rid of these percolators in our opinion as they appear cheap and inefficient - the coffee produced was only in small quantities and the machine was temperamental. Having said that, this was our only gripe. Breakfast was not too crowded, the service was excellent and the choice was very good. We thought it was rather expensive nevertheless at 17 euros each. We would certainly return to the Mercure Montmartre in the future as it has everything you need from a Paris hotel.

When we came down the next morning however, there was a line up of people sitting around in the foyer waiting for taxis.

When he came back into the hotel to let me know, the guy behind the desk told us that there were others in line waiting for a taxi, and that we need to wait for our turn - even though my hubby had flagged down the taxi himself.

I've stayed at other hotels where there would be someone from the hotel standing outside flagging down taxis and making sure that everyone was on their way.

On the positive side the location of the hotel was fantastic and the rooms (of which we stayed in two) were very well decorated and clean. Unfortunately the service and management at the hotel negates all this. On arrival we were told that the room we had booked for three nights was only available for the last two nights and the first night we would have to stay in another room, moving on the second day. Firstly when staying only three days in a hotel I do not appreciate having to repack and move all my belongings one day into the stay. And secondly if for whatever reason the hotel did not have the room I had reserved available then I would have appreciated being informed of this prior to my arrival at the hotel. Having finally moved to the room we had booked we found that the air conditioning was not working. It was unbearably hot in the room. Despite both myself and my partner phoning and going down to reception multiple times we were not given a satisfactory answer as to why we had no air con. Different members of staff gave us different reasons, some saying it was a problem throughout the hotel - however as soon as we stepped outside the door of our room it was perfectly cool in the hallways. Every time we asked we were told that someone was working on it. So you may ask why we didnt call the 'direct line' to management that the manager seems so keen to mention?

I booked 2 renovated rooms on the upper floors. When I checked in I found that one of the rooms allocated to me was a disabled room. That is not a problem in itself. The real problems started when we returned from dinner and decided to shower. There is no shower screen in the bathroom (to enable wheelchair access), and the water flooded all over the bathroom floor. It was impossible to contain the water only to the shower area. Without any other floor drains the water could not possibly drain away and puddled about 13mm or half an inch all around the toilet and the hand basin. During the early hours when I visited the bathroom I found myself wading through the water (where's the wellies I thought?) When I climbed back in bed I found that the bottom of my pyjamas were soaked from the puddles. The next morning when I compained to the front desk staff I was told that if I waited around the hotel till noon then I could change rooms. When I told them that we would be out sightseeing at tht time and was there any other alternative. I was told that they would send up someone to mop the floors whenever I asked, so I said that I would therefore stay in the room.......what a mistake. After returning late to the hotel and showering we had the same problem. Called the front desk to get the floor mopped and was told that no-one would be able to come to the room to mop the floor. It was only about 9.30pm. There was no satisfaction given, nor any follow-up from management. I also dislike the attitude of hotel staff who deny the existance of any problems in a room when you can tell that the problem has been there for ages. In this case I photographed the bathroom floor to show the permanent water stains on the black floor tiles to prove this was not the first time that the room had flooded.

The rooms are quiet, even though we faced a busy road (roadworks at the time of our stay, improving the layout at Place de Clichy). An unexpected find for the Continent was tea/coffee making facility in the room. It is a hotel used by many tour groups for one night stays so can be busy in the mornings but regular guests have a separate dining area for breakfast. There is plenty of choice of cereals, bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs plus the usual continental cold meats and cheeses with a wide selection of bread, croissants etc. fruit juice, teas and coffee. Alongside the Cemetery of Montmartre (an interesting place to visit), it is near the Moulin Rouge (very expensive - cheapest dinner and show being 150 euros) and at the edge of Pigalle. It seemed a perfectly safe area from what we saw. The little 'train' is a good way of getting to know the layout of Montmartre. It leaves from Place Blanche and costs 6 euros per person, stopping at Sacre-Coeur where you can get out and return by a later 'train' . Metro tickets are valid on the buses - a carnet of 10 costs 12 euros. We found an interesting bistro at 'Au Virage Lepic' up the steep Rue Lepic. The food is excellent. There are many eateries all over Montmartre to cater for all tastes. The Mercure does not offer an evening menu and seemed to have the restaurant only for breakfast. In the city, the Batobus is a useful vehicle for stopping off on a river trip at points of interest along the Seine. We didn't use it so cannot quote the cost. It is a get on and off facility over about 8 places. As people over the age of 55, we were pleased to accept a 2 for 1 offer on the breakfast.

The price was so low (less that we spent on airfare alone to Italy two years ago) that we told ourselves that the hotel was more or less free and that we wouldn't complain about it. By the end of our week we were quite pleased that we in fact had nothing to complain about. The hotel itself is what I would call a budget business class hotel (akin to an urban Holiday Inn in North America) housed in a fairly nondescript modern building. It has zero charm but is well maintained, functional and the rooms are large enough with all the expected features. We actually had a view of the golden dome of the Invalides and the Eieffel tower off in the distance! If you want a view make sure you're on at least the fifth floor and facing in the right direction. Try to avoid the viewless first floor which is just down the hall from the noisy breakfast room and various meeting halls. Our package included a full breakfast: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, pastries, cereal, fruit, yogurt, cheese, bread etc.... and most importantly excellent coffee! Certainly no complaints here, but I think if it had not been included in our package we wouldn't have paid the 17 euros but instead would have gone to one of the nearby cafes. There's not much else to say about the hotel itself except to mention that it's lack of charm is easily made up for by the friendly and extremely helpful front desk staff who were always happy to assist us non-French speakers with restaurant reservations and other requests. I've been to a couple of 5 stars whose front desks were far less useful. In terms of location, the hotel is on the edge of Montmartre rather then in the central core of Paris where you'll probably be spending most of your time. It's true that it's fairly close to a rather seedy area along the Boulevard de Clichy (the Moulin Rouge is here), but it's just as close to the best part of Montmartre...Rue Joseph de Maistre, Rue des Martyres, Rue des Abbesses, Rue Lepic etc where it's non-touristy yet filled with wonderful restaurants, patisseries, bistros etc. We could have happily come here every night for dinner. If you really want the full tourist experience Place de Tetre and Sacre Cour are no more then a 15-20 minute walk away. If you prefer a hotel where many of the great sites of Paris are an easy walk from your front door, this isn't the place. Nonetheless, there's plenty of nearby public transit. Almost at the front door is the stop for bus 95 which will take you to Gallerie Lafayette, the Opera, the Louvre (about 20 minutes) and St Germain de Pres. Next to it is the stop for bus 30 which passes by Parc Monceau and the Arch de Triomphe/Champs Elysees on its way to the Trocedero across the river from the Eiffel Tower. We'd also see bus 80(?) passing by which travels along the Seine past Nortre Dame on its way to Ville de Cite (close to the Pompideau Centre) but we never figured out where its stop was! Instead we took a short stroll to Place de Clichy where we had two subway lines to take us anywhere we wanted to go.

Of course, there are a lot of other great streets in the area, but we've decided not to stay in this hotel again because of the seediness of this one street.

We had breakfast included and while it was busy some days there was always a place to sit - I noticed some people complained about the service on Tripadvisor but we had no problems at all - it is a buffet after all and not a full service resturant! There are plenty of resturants around the area/Macdonalds down the street for free wi-fi and a middle eastern takeout spot across the road if your in a hurry...5 euro's for a filling meal - cant go wrong! You can walk to the Moulin Rouge from the hotel as well as all of Montmarte's sights...be warned though its a lot of uphill so take it easy if you are unfit or have health issues...if thats the case just head over to the subway no biggie.

I chose it because, among all the Accor hotels in Paris, it offered the best location for the lowest price. It is located just off Place de Clichy, a place not so inspiring because congested with traffic, but very convenient since it's just at the foot of the Montmartre hill, very close to the Moulin Rouge (if you're into that kind of shows - we weren't) and to several station. The hotel looks horrible from the outside. Unfortunately, among all the old buildings along the street, it occupies part of a huge ugly white concrete block, which hosts an unispiring shopping centre, a car parking and an Ibis hotel as well as the Mercure. As you enter the hall you feel relieved as you realise it actually looks like a hotel inside! I had never been to a Mercure so I didn't really know what to expect. The pictures on the website looked really nice, but they are supposed to, aren't they? All in all the hotel is good, it is quite basic, but you probably won't need many frills in a city like Paris, which will keep you busy for most of the day and tire you so much that you will be sleeping by 10pm... Anyway, some of the reception staff were really nice and approachable, some others less so, the common areas are basic, with just a couple of sofas and a small bar (we didn't have breakfat at the hotel so I can't comment on that). The room was basic too, with plain furnishing, the toilet was OK, the beds not so comfortable. The best part was definitely the view. As the building has 8 or 9 floors you might want to ask for a top floor room overlooking the city. We didn't ask for one, but they allocated one to us and it was absolutely amazing. We could see most of Paris from the 7th floor, with the Tour Eiffel flashing at night. The room also featured a mini bar and a free safe, which we loved. I must say we enjoyed our stay. It was our first time in Paris so we probably weren't much interested in a fancy hotel. The Mercure did its purpose, it was well located, functional and clean. The full price for a room is hefty in my opinion, but it probably reflects normal prices for that category in Paris. We paid much less due to the discount I got so I didn't investigate it. Be aware of the bill anyway. We decided not to have breakfast at the hotel and so we said at check-in but at check out we were charged for breakfast every day. Additionally, we were charged for bar items we didn't take. The lady at reception was really nice and polite and eventually charged us the correct amount, but make sure you don't get charged for breakfast if you don't want it. Also be aware that if you accidentally move any contents of the bar, a sensor will indicate that you've taken it and will automatically charge you for that item (!)", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Mercure Paris Montmartre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197567-Reviews-Mercure_Paris_Montmartre-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$145 - $317*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3 Rue Caulaincourt</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75018</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515240", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/90/9d/1c/mercure-paris-montmartre.jpg"}}
