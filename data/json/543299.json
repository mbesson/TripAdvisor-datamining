This is a great hotel for the business traveler or the conference goer but the average tourist will find it isolated from anything interesting to do.

I've used this to book great stays in San Francisco, Las Vegas, Basel (Switzerland) and had wonderful experiences. Sometimes you get a sense that the hotel staff at reception knows you're not paying full price and might not give you the best service, but never have I had such a negative, shall we say struggle, with the front desk staff. Upon check-in, I informed the staff that I would be joined by a friend later, to which they responded that my booking was only for single occupancy. The first gentleman I dealt with was actually quite kind and suggested he would let it slip, but that there might only be one bed in the room. Indeed, there was only one bed--not queen-sized, only large enough for one person. I went back to reception and said I would be glad to pay the extra, but that it confused me because I thought I had booked for double occupancy. In fact, Priceline bookings are always noted for double occupancy, but they told me I would need to pay 20 EUR extra per night. This might be reasonable if the rate included breakfast, but it did not. I called Priceline at my own long-distance expense and they said they would look into it and get back to me within 5 days. As it was Easter weekend and I did not hear back from Priceline before my check-out, I had to talk to the reception staff repeatedly and only at check-out did they actually rescind the 20 EUR per night fee. The night before check-out, I asked if they might comp breakfast the next morning because of the trouble and nuisance the situation had caused. I thought it a reasonable request, but it was flat out denied. THAT SAID... the hotel is rather beautiful, posh, and comfortable. It has a small fitness facility including a tanning bed for 5 EUR/10 minutes. It's a bit of a walk (10-15 minutes) from the nearest U- and S-Bahn station at Potsdamer Platz, but there are closer bus stops with intermittent service.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cClean and good hotel\u201d", "Author": "salsaaudi", "ReviewID": "UR127187527", "Content": "This hotel is about an hour ride as I decided to use the public transport as it was much cheaper.

Fine dining is available in the Grand Restaurant M which is open from 6pm daily.
