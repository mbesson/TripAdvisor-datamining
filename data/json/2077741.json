The pool is tiny (under 6 ft wide at one end - I did a width without moving!) but it's nice to have along with a steam room / sauna / gym. Also the location is great - you're right next to a lovely park and you just take the 200 bus which runs regularly and into town. The journey takes 15-20 mins and is easier than the tube. So overall we'd recommend the place. Two gripes though: one, the restaurant staff were rude when we arrived for dinner at the pre-arranged time; and two, they tried to charge us EUR 18 for a pot of coffee on room service! That just seems like extortion and leaves a nasty taste. If you do go, make sure you head to the Cafe Am Neuen See a few minutes away in the park. It's an awesome outdoor beergarden - our favourite place in the city!", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for a weekend getaway or a business meeting\u201d", "Author": "InnaSapo", "ReviewID": "UR128399484", "Content": "Very interesting hotel, they have a sea theme all around it, e.g. dolphin's singing in the elevator - which is quite an interesting touch and life&travel quotes by famous people on the walls! :) I used this hotel for a meeting, meeting space is very well equiped, our room was with natural lighting and located in the quiet corridor so you can be sure nothing will disturb you during your meeting. F&B service is immaculate, a waiter called Nicholas who assisted us with meeting requirements/lunch was quick and nice to deal with. Hotel Spa is on a very high level, it is not a huge area, but enough for about 6-8 people. The main thing is that everything is very clean and it is a pleasure to use their Spa at the end of a long meeting. Great hotel location, just 10 min walk from a shopping area and 30 min drive from Tegel Airport. Rooms are really quiet, clean and very stylish. Room service food is extremely superb, applause to their evening Chef! The only minus is the wi-fi, it is quite slow if you required to access web portals, but is ok for the emails.

Hotel is suituated in the Embassy quarter and is reasonably new. Rooms are bright, fresh and clean. Good strong shower and plenty of shampoo, shower gel etc so you don't need to take your own. Whilst no subway nearby, the hotel is only a 10 minute walk from the station at the zoo but this is made pointless by the bus stop right outside the door. The 200 bus takes you into Postdamer Platz and onto Alexanderplatz, or to the terminus at the zoo if going the other direction. If arriving into Schonefeld airport take the train to Bundesplatz and catch the U9 to the Zoo. The 200 bus will take you to the hotel door. No wi-fi in the rooms but they do offer free cabled internet in the room, with wi-fi available in the hotel lobby. They also offer a pc with printer in the lobby for free use - ideal for online check-in etc. Used the fitness centre. Pool is small and a bit cold - not really suited for swiming or children who want to play. Small sauna and steam room are adequate. No changing rooms at the pool so get changed in your room. Towels are available at the pool but can be in short supply later in the day. Small gym with various weights, bikes and running machines adjacent to the pool. Didn't use the restaurant for breakfast preferring to eat on the go. Plenty of choices at all of the main tourist points - Postdamer Platz probably gives the best selection. Overall a good hotel with friendly, helpfull staff. Ideal location for exploring with Tiergarten park only a 5 minute walk away for those who like to get into the fresh air.

(Oh, and the price was good, too.) Pleased to say, it was a really good 6-night stay. The bedrooms are just about OK size-wise (the generally clever design has ended up with a bit of a squeeze near the fitted wardrobe), but against that the bathroom space is generous. So well-lit is the bathroom that you might need sunglasses. A blue light over the bath gives the water a touch of the warm sea, and if you flip a venetian blind you can look from your bath through the bedroom and out of the window. (Brrr!) Great shower, by the way. Overall, your private quarters have been made to feel as light and bright as the Algarve, all white and blue. Good bed, extra pillows if you ask, stylish chairs. The hotel actually says 'style' everywhere - good furnishings, and quirky touches like a projected seascape of swimming fish on the floor of reception. The lift lobbies on the various floors all have a wall of poetic quotations translated in several languages, where a key theme seems to be the sea, and death - death at sea, even. A bit odd, perhaps, certainly in Berlin, but at least it gets the guests talking. Breakfasts were good, although the capacity of the restaurant seems pretty finely calculated: we never waited for a table, but there were usually only one or two spare. We tried the food once or twice at other times, and reckon the Portuguese dishes are excellent whereas the German or international are just OK. The hotel staff were super - friendly and helpful, without exception. When we were there, quite a few parents or grandparents were staying and taking the kids to the zoo, which is right nearby. As a location, the Pestana is not at all bad. Excellent for walks in the Tiergarten, Berlin's main park, which is just a short street away; dependent otherwise on the number 200 bus, stopping just by the hotel, which has a great route from Zoo Station right through Potsdamer Platz to Unter den Linden and East Berlin, but was (in our experience) a bit erratic. We waited quite a few times longer than the scheduled 10 minutes, and gave up once and just walked. If you don't take the bus, be prepared for a 15-minute walk (at least) to the nearest underground, a bit less perhaps to the shops. We would certainly go back to the Pestana, although to be honest it'd be even nicer to visit them in Portugal again!", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cGreat deal for price.\u201d", "Author": "chanteusecrystal", "ReviewID": "UR121122257", "Content": "My husband I and stayed here for two nights, and I must say it was a very comfortable and quiet hotel.

Transportation however is not a problem, both the 100 and the 200 buses stop by the hotel on a very regular schedule and they take you to the busier parts of the city in no time. The Zoo is within walking distance, so is the Philarmonie. Rooms: Rooms are functional and confortable. Well decorated, great design and color palet,mostly white and blue. Bed was confortable, although conforter was a lit bit too warm for October. Bathroom has a tub with a really big shower. Closet is a bit small for a bigger stay. Big TV flat screen. Free wireless is slow, but you can buy a quicker connection or go downstairs to the lobby computer. Design and decoration: Since Pestana is a portuguese hotel chain, the \"sea theme\" for the decoration was a really good choice! Details like portuguese poems written in the walls and wave sounds on the elevators were really appreciated. Breakfast buffet: nice bread selection, great croissants, 3 kinds of juice, tea, coffee, milk, 2 kinds of cereal, boiled or stirred eggs, sausages, bacon, tomato, cucumber, salmon, big selection of cheese and hams, 4 kinds of jam, nutella and honey...everything was very well prepared and fresh! Highly recommended! Staff: since it's a new hotel I guess they are still a bit inexperient...the girls in the lobby were not very imaginative when giving suggestions (I wonder if it's just because they are German...).

I should note however that the window wasn\u2019t clean (two large smudge marks on the window). TV channels provided are mainly German (as you\u2019d expect), with the only English-speaking channels being BBC World and another American channel. The rooms are very clean (aside from the window already mentioned), and we were very happy. I personally found the beds to be quite uncomfortable; however that may be because we use a Tempur mattress at home, so that view may be slightly unfair!

The air conditioning in the room is fantastic \u2013 no problems at all. Very cold when you want it to be, and similarly very hot when you want it to be.

It\u2019s a digital 4-digit code safe, and very easy to use. The room also has an iPod dock, which I used to listen to music from my iPhone. It also charges it, so leave your charger at home with confidence! (iPhone 3GS) The room was very quiet, and we heard nothing from our neighbours! Internet Access Wireless internet is available for free in the lobby, based on a one-hour token system which the staff are happy to provide multiple codes for when you arrive. The lobby also has a PC if you don\u2019t bring a computer with you, which is rarely being used, so you\u2019ll often be able to get on. A standard ethernet connection is provided in the room (also free), but make sure your laptop has an ethernet port!

Gym The gym is brilliant, but (as to be expected) there isn\u2019t a great range for anyone into weightlifting - The fixed-weight dumbbells go up to 10kg. Also in the gym is a treadmill, a cycling machine, a cross trainer, and benches for weight lifting. The gym opens from 7am until 10pm each day, and was never busy during our stay. \u2018Wellness Area\u2019 (Spa) The \u2018Wellness Area\u2019 has the following: Pool, Loungers, Steam Room & Sauna. The pool is very nice, although don\u2019t expect to be able to swim lengths with another person in the pool. The pool is a slightly awkward shape, which makes the problem worse. The loungers are nice, though in busy periods you won\u2019t get one! (Which we often found) The steam room and sauna are really nice, but as with the rest of the \u2018Wellness Area\u2019, they\u2019re often busy. The Wellness Area opens from 7am until 10pm each day. Quiet periods are during the early morning and during the middle of the day. It gets very busy later in the morning and from about 6pm onwards. Restaurant (Breakfast) The breakfast included in the room is great, and we really enjoyed it. Included is the following (not an exhaustive list): Sausages, bacon, scrambled egg, hard boiled eggs (though not on purpose!), toast, croissants, apples, various condiments and spreads, cheese, various cold meats, muesli, cornflakes, fresh tomatoes and cucumber, salmon, bread rolls and yoghurts. Drinks on offer: Various teas, coffee, apple juice, orange juice and water. Everything here was fantastic quality, and we looked forward to breakfast every day! Location We found the hotel was ideally located for reaching all of the attractions, and actually found because of this we didn\u2019t even need a travel pass for the week. It is a few metres away from the Tiergarten and not much further from the embassies. A short walk takes you into the favourites. You can easily walk from the Zoologischer Garten S-Bahn station, which we did. A simple ABC single (3 eur) will take you to/from the airport. Take the \u2018AirportExpress\u2019 \u2013 It\u2019s much faster! Staff We found the staff generally OK, though don\u2019t expect much from the staff in the restaurant. We found them quite rude, and making guests wait whilst they took priority walking through \u2013 One even asked for our room number (having asked for no-one else\u2019s) quite rudely, then asked again five minutes later; with a bad attitude. Staff on reception were better, though certainly no charmers. No real issues there. Cleaning staff were very friendly, and we had no problems with them at all (although one day they didn\u2019t empty the bin \u2013 worth noting, as it was full!) Parking We didn't park at the hotel, but it's 15 eur per night. Overall, an excellent hotel, and one we would stay at again. If it were not for some small downfalls, it would definitely have scored a 5. On this occasion, it scores a 4. Thank you Pestana Berlin for a brilliant stay.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAll that you can ask for!\u201d", "Author": "JTereso", "ReviewID": "UR113260119", "Content": "Me and my wife just arrived fromm our 4 day trip to berlin, where we stayed at the Pestana Tiergarten Hotel for some lovelly 3 nights!

The breakfast is superb (expect for the eggs, a little dry) with plenty of choice. The rooms are fully equipped and beautifully designed with a huge bed and spacious bathroom. The hotel has a spa and gym. The hotel is located in a very quiet zone, next to the tiergarten and a lot of embassy buildings. Despite that, the 200 bus line has stops right in front of the hotel, making it very easy to get everywhere you want to go, as the 200 bus is one of the 2 lines that cross the city through the center.

When we booked the room we couldn't find a review of this new hotel, so we were a bit skeptical in advance. The design of the hotel is a bit futuristic, and a little cheesy, but everything is new, so not much to complain about. The service was okay, and the receptionists were helpful and spoke understandable English. The room was nice. Modern and spacious, but we didn't get exactly what we booked, as another reviewer also write here on Trip advisor. We booked our room through hotels.com, and the description said that the rooms have a balcony, a city-view and free wireless internet. I read the review about this here the day before departure, and called hotels.com to get this clearified. They called Pestana and who said that not all rooms have balcony, even though this is what stood on hotels.com when we ordered. They said we could request a room with balcony, which we did, but did not get. Maybe the hotel is not to blame, and only hotels.com, but it was a bit dissapointing. The view from the room was to the backyard of the nearby embassy. There was a wi-fi to connect to, but it was free only for 24 hours. Worked fine. The beds in the room was just okay, and two single beds were placed next to each other, but not attached in any way, so they glided apart all the time. When booking the room it said the bathroom had a bathtub, which it did not. The shower was large and comfortable, so we didn't mind. Positive: A small speaker with iPod/iPhone connection next to the bed. Charged my iPhone 4 and played music. Very nice. Large TV with movie rentals. A bit expensive(13 euro for a movie) though. The location of the hotel was very good for our part. The 200 bus route, which goes from the Zoo to Alexanderplatz stops almost right outside the hotel, and can get you anywhere. I think the nearest stop is named Corneliusstrasse. The restaurant was a little above average. The breakfast was nice. We rented a couple of bikes from the hotel for 8 euro per bike for a whole day. This was maybe our best experience in Berlin. The city is very good for cyclists, even though there is a lot of construction work downtown. A cycling trip thrugh the large park of Tiergarten was terrific in the afternoon! Since I couldn't find a photo of the front side of the hotel online, I took a couple of photos myself so people can see what it looks like.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PencilPrincess", "Title": "\u201cProfessional and Good\u201d", "Author": "PencilPrincess", "ReviewID": "UR110400251", "Content": "I chose this hotel for it's proximity to the Embassies. I was surprised to find absolutely no reviews of this hotel online when I booked it, but then I found out it was very new. No reviews, new hotel, awesome location = exciting unknown. When we walked up to the Pestana we knew we were in the clear. The hotel is lovely as well as lovingly placed. Customer service is as I, personally, like it: straightforward, very professional and no frills. Just good, straight service. Breakfast buffet was lovely. 4 star level indeed. Just to mention a few of the offerings: Lax, Nurenberger sausages, bio yoghurt in glass jars with kiwis, chives, a selection of Granini juices, self service espresso machine and a silver carafe of coffee at every table. Presentation was clean and lovely. I found myself looking forward to breakfast. A sweet location in the Embassy district. The lap pool and sauna were also great benefits for us in the morning before we started our day. Despite all the great restaurants in Berlin, we looked forward to sampling the food here after a long day about the town. The restaurant provided nice service and good food. We especially liked the Portugese Fish Soup.

One of the reasons to choose the newly opened Pestana Berlin Tiergarten out of the 1000 hotels in Berlin, was the despriction on hotels.com, which among other things promised a room with balcony, city view and free wifi. Once we arrived at the hotel, we got a room with no balcony, no city view and no wifi. We complained of course, but there wasn\u2019t much to do, as the 6th floor with the balconies and the city views apparently wasn\u2019t open yet. Moreover the reservation manager claimed that the room type, which we had booked, didn\u2019t have balcony, city view and free wifi. We showed her the booking, where it - nevertheless - was clearly stated. But, that was a mistake, she just said. We asked for compensation and got a free lunch to a value of 10 euro \u2013 not much when we had (pre)payed around 90 euro per night to stay there. Apart from this, the hotel itself was quite nice; brand new and with pretty big rooms. Especially the bed and the bath room was a nice experience. Also the breakfast was above average with a wide selection of food and drinks. Taken into consideration that the hotel is situated in the middle of Berlin, the location is quite bad - unless you are attending a meeting or a conference at one of the many embassies around. The area is really quiet and boring, and the hotel\u2019s pretty far from the nearest U- or S-bahn. All in all, you\u2019ll be happier choosing one of the many other good hotels in Berlin - and hopefully then you\u2019ll also get a hotel, where you get what you booked.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Pestana Berlin Tiergarten", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d2077741-Reviews-Pestana_Berlin_Tiergarten-Berlin.html", "Price": "$96 - $197*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Stuelerstrasse 6</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10787</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2077741", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f1/29/f2/pestana-berlin-tiergarten.jpg"}}
