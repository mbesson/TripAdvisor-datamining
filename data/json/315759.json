{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great location, great views, great price! These apartments were a revelation, ideally situated 5 minutes from Kings Cross and across the wharf from the Royal Botanical Gardens (which take you direct to the Opera House and Circular Quay). For a few dollars extra a Harbour View studio gives you stunning views across the harbour to the Opera House and Darling Harbour. The actual studios are a little shabby (decor circa 1970s!!) but this is more than made up for by the friendliness/helpfulness of the staff, the location and the cost. Book it now!!", "Date": "Mar 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR491179484", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Alison66"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d315759-r4728934-The_Grantham-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "315759", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
