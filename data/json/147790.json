The architecture is really unique, concrete modern style lofts that are all open air. I will say you should use the bug spray that they provide though the mosquitos are something fierce in those parts. You can hear the rainforest come alive around 5:00 am, which was a unique experience for me. All of the staff was very friendly and gracious. Every day our loft was stocked with fresh eggs, fruit, bread, coffee and juices. All you need to start your day, of lounging by their poolside or hitting the local beaches.

It's on a quiet hill in Vieques. There are three buildings with guest rooms, one designed with a circle in mind (Redonda), another with a triangle (Triangular), and another with a square/rectangle (Rectangular). We stayed in the Redonda, it was really amazing, like no other place I've stayed. In terms of the space, it's entirely concrete with architect-designed furniture. The bunker-like architecture blurs the line between inside and outside. There are large \"windows\" (they're so large, calling them \"windows\" isn't entirely accurate, one of them was about the size of a movie theater screen) but there are no screens. So you will see lizards in your room. We found one on a shirt in our closet when we were packing up to leave. They particularly come out at night, especially if have lights on. They're innocuous though, and not so many in number that we felt even remotely close to overwhelmed by them, quite the contrary, they enhanced the experience by amplifying the tropical setting. We also noticed a bird that took a liking to our kitchen, and we found it snooping around our dining area on occasion. The bathroom in our unit was outdoors, vine covered, with a view of the Vieques hills. We found a little tree frog and a millipede climbing around the vines in our outdoor shower. All of these animals enhanced our experience, though I mention it because I realize this type of setting may not be everyone's cup of tea. The climate inside our unit was comfortable no matter what time of day. We did not really have any bug issues -- maybe some ants and mosquitos here and there (and I'm pretty sure the same bird I saw in our kitchen was nibbling on the soap in our bathroom throughout our stay) but nothing that made the experience any less amazing. Hix Island house is a quiet place, and unless you go there with a bunch of people (which would probably be really fun, will keep that idea in mind), you'll likely go to bed early, but you won't mind. The front desk at the Island House has remarkably friendly and helpful staff. They have great insight into what to do on the island, and where to eat, and they will arrange reservations for you if you ask them. They also have boogie boards, masks, snorkels etc. at the front desk that you can borrow, and the rooms come with portable beach chairs and a small cooler that you can take to the beach with you. I won't go into detail about the architecture at Hix. Suffice it to say it's really amazing and unique (including the pool, and all of the Hix-designed buildings). If you don't mind being a little closer to nature and the elements than you usually are (albeit in a luxurious kind of way), you aren't looking for a place with a late, on-site, night life, and you love minimalist eco-conscious architecture, then there is no place on Vieques other than Hix that you should consider staying.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201carchitecture and landscape paradise\u201d", "Author": "EMUarch", "ReviewID": "UR127776528", "Content": "we went for our honeymoon and it was great! beautiful yet simple architecture, funtional yet design oriented! an architects paradise! we were invited to the Casona for a cocktail for guests given by John Hix himself and his wife Neeva.

The pictures I saw on their website were, in my opinion, misleading; they show rooms that are much more clean and bright than what you actually get. In reality, the room we stayed in was dark for most of the day and there were lots of mosquitos. I also found a Tarantual under my shoes one morning, which I actually thought was pretty cool, but it scared the heck out of me. Due to a flight delay, we were unable to make it to the island for our first night at Hix. We called ahead and were told that this would not be a problem and I was lead to believe that we would not be charged for missing that night. However, when we arrived, we were informed that there was \"nothing they could do\" and we would be charged. Fortunately, we were able to re-arrange our plans and ended up staying an extra night at no charge. So in the end, this part worked out fine and we appreciated the management's flexibility. After checking in and showering, we noticed that the shower was not draining. The water backed up and flooded the entire room. We used a bunch of towels to clean up what we could, then stopped by the office to report the incident as we went out for the evening. They assured us that it would be taken care of right away. Great! When we returned almost 4 hours later, there were still towels and water all over the floor so I called the number for the manager, which is listed in every room. Nobody answered. We wanted to shower (we had done the biobay tour), but didn't want to flood everything again, so we went to bed and left it for the morning. When I talked to the front desk the next day, I was told that the shower was fixed, so I went to check it. Indeed, they had fixed the shower, but had not bothered to let us know and they had done nothing to clean up the mess throughout the room. We informed the front desk of this, but even when we returned at the end of the second day, the sopping towels were still in our room and there were more and more mosquitos from all the standing water. The free bread is nice and we really liked that they provide some fruit and eggs every day, but these small luxuries do not make up for the inadequate service and poor room conditions. We picked this place BECAUSE we like eco-lodging in general, but for the price of these rooms I just expect more (better furniture, nicer kitchen equipment, better lighting, but most of all, better service). I understand that things go wrong, and that is fine, but I don't really want to hear excuses about it. Things do go wrong, and at a well organized, high-end establishment, the problem is taken care of right away and you can feel good about it. Hix House just isn't one of those places.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cUpscale nature holiday\u201d", "Author": "waynem1", "ReviewID": "UR126451259", "Content": "We spent almost 2 weeks at Hix Island House and slept like babies the whole time. Waking each morning to a wide screen view (9 ft. x 22 ft.) of the tree tops and ocean beyond with the sun rising over the ocean. The rooms and associated private terraces are very large and fully open air, wherein that wide screen view is your non glazed window to the world. The non glazing is a bit weird at first as you keep wanting to close something across the opening or pull down hurricane shutters. Give it a day and you will come to love this open air concept. We may have been the only guests who did the whole 2 weeks on good quality mountain bikes we reserved through Blackbeard Sports. We only saw 2 other people on bikes during our rides. Car drivers gave us lots of clearance and they drive quite slow. Bikes are not for the faint hearted though as Hix Island House is at the upper area of the mountain range that runs along the island and everything is pretty much down hill from there and a trek on the return. We shopped daily for food with backpacks and bikes in either Isabelle II or in Esperanza. However if you do the same be prepared for the hill climbs of your life to get back to Hix. Most folks rent jeeps, but I don't think they enjoyed the beautiful pool at Hix as much as we did after our rides. The breakfast supplies provided by Hix were excellent and a great start to the day. Beaches we visited had no one on them and the one we found with people had just 24 people on a 2 km white sand beach. Hats off to all at Hix for making ours a most memorable stay.

First, the staff are very cold and unhelpful - not what you would expect for the prices they charge. Second, you better not stay up after the sun goes down because you will experience a total bug attack. Hix is on a tropical island so it is quite warm and there was no breeze when we stayed. The windows have no screens, so what this means is that when you keep you lights on after the sun goes down a huge array of insects will descend on you in your room. This happened to us on our first night and all we could do was sit on the bed under the mosquito net while insects small to humongous landed on the net weighing it down so much that we had to periodically shake the net to get them off. So gross and definitely not a good set-up for romance. We decided we could not stay and told the hotel staff what had happened. They wanted to charge us for the 3 subsequent nights we had reserved the room for even though we would not be staying there those three nights, it was not the high season, and there was only one other couple staying at the time. They also let us know that we should have used bug spray. Thanks! But I don't think that would have done the trick. If we had known that it was more like camping than staying in a hotel we could have made a decision as to whether we were up for that or not on our honeymoon.

If you are going to be eco, wouldn't you try to get fruit that does not travel so far, especially if the hotel is located in a tropical climate?! The cereal was just plan old corn flakes.

There were numerous windows with wooden interior shutters, but the one wall was permanently open from about waist up and about 30 feet wide. It was like a Frank Lloyd Wright cabin in the woods.

The pool is perfect- pretty surroundings, great view, unusual shape, long enough to swim laps. It seems like the upstairs lofts are really cool. We needed two beds. The only room w/two beds is The Gallery. This is a rustic room- a simple square shape, two twin beds, some very basic furniture, and unpainted cement floor/ceiling/walls. It got dirty so fast and there's no housekeeping service. The bathroom floor was getting gross by the end of the second day and my friend had to clean the drain. Our room was screened in but the front door had large openings near the floor. We sprayed a circle of raid around the beds an hour before going to sleep, and our poison moat took care of the roaches we found each morning. By the time I saw the second tarantula outside next to the room in the same day (really), this became a real problem. We checked out the next morning for the more civilized but less interesting Tamarindo. Consider these two things. 1) This was a basic room. It's the apparent afterthought of the owner. It should be priced this way. We paid $205/night (w/tax) in the offest of all off-seasons. I can see why some of the lofts cost considerably more, but this was an insult. This room should be priced at $75 in off season, and $125 in season. Maybe add $25 for the pool and service and $25 for the kitchen that was stocked with basic foods each day. 2) We apparently had the only ground level room with a screened forth wall. All rooms have only 3 walls and open to the views- cool, but on the ground floor I can't imagine what walks in after seeing what we dealt with.

We stayed at Hix as a part of our Honeymoon. This is an extremely relaxing and beautiful property. However, you must be prepared to live with nature in all its positives and negatives. I read every review on Hix Island House before we booked and I thought I knew what to expect. Be prepared for the bugs and nature to be part of your life. We stayed in Loft 1, which was beautiful. All of the Lofts have a very Zen design and definitely contribute to a very peaceful atmosphere. But again, be prepared for nature. When we checked in, we were told that there are not very many bugs up where the buildings are situated and we found that to be false. The first night we were invaded by an army of very tiny red ants (not sure if they are fire ants but they sure bite) and we woke up with approximately 100 bites on our bodies. We pulled the sheets back and there were hundreds of ants in the bed. They most certainly were not there when we went to bed as we did a thorough check of the bedding. We immediately informed management and they changed the sheets and sprayed around the room. We also bought numerous types of bug sprays/repellents at the local store in order protect ourselves. We spent approximately 15 minutes before we went to bed the remaining four nights spraying around the area and spraying ourselves with bug spray. (Side note: the mosquito nets do not work well when you use the fans they provide and are very hard to keep the bed covered with the fans blowing them around. Also, be prepared it doesn't really get lower than 78 degrees at night and it is humid. The fans help, but the \"trade winds\" are not exactly air conditioning. We got used to the temperature after a day or two, but its not exactly cool) We did not have any further problems with the ants. But there are many other bugs/wildlife that will be in your room and you need to know whether you can in fact deal with them or not. It rained several nights of our stay and we did have a ton of mosquitoes in our room. Additionally, we did encounter between 5-10 cockroaches (they are big) in various parts of our room, including the robes hanging in the bathroom. There was also a very large spider in the outdoor shower that literally jumped several feet across the shower when we tried to get it. Helpful tip, make sure you put away any food and definitely check the floor to make sure there are no stray pieces or crumbs, the ants will find it and they will swarm to it and they will bite you. There are variety of lizards that will be on the walls and crawling around the room. They did not bother us at all, they are very unobtrusive and help with bug control. But again, you need to know whether you can deal with them, because they will be there. They are also all around the pool and the property. We also had a few very small frogs in our outdoor shower which was very cool. Overall, the rooms were clean. We did notice the new bed sheet they put on our bed for the last night of our stay was stained fairly significantly. Also, the white robes in the bathroom were stayed yellow in places as was one of the night shirts that they leave for you in the room. I'm sure they take bad linens out of their rotation but these did make it through whatever quality control they have. The pool is wonderful. It is a great temperature and you could literally spend a day just at the pool and your room. It is small, but we only encountered a few wonderful people at the random times while we were down there. We also did Yoga the last three days we were there and it was wonderful. The instructor is very good with all practice levels and made us feel very comfortable. I was a Yoga virgin, but she surely got me hooked. The grounds and ambiance of the setting certainly help magnify the experience. I do not mean to say that the hotel is not wonderful, because it truly is spectacular. Even with the Ant attack, we had an amazing stay. The grounds are well kept. The views from the property are spectacular. All the employees are very nice and more than willing to provide you with helpful advice about the island or give you anything they can to make the stay better. You just need to make sure that this is something you can handle. It will not be like any experience you have ever had. The beaches on the island are truly spectacular. Every beach we went to could be the cover of a travel magazine and the hotel helps by providing lounge chairs, beach towels, a cooler, snorkeling gear, and wave boards. Seriously the beaches are the most beautiful I have ever seen. There was hardly anyone else there and many times we were the only people on the beach for several hours. If you love beaches you will love Vieques. Helpful tips: Rent a Jeep. You will need 4-wheel drive to get to some of the spectacular beaches on Vieques. We used Maritiza's Car Rental and they were very good. They seemed to have the best vehicles on the Island. Be prepared that most of the companies will not give you space tire, you have to call them if you get a flat tire. Some of the beach access roads are very rocky and we got a flat tire at Secret Beach and had to call. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE WITH YOU. Its not likely you will encounter another person if you are at one of the secluded beaches. Overall, a beautiful location. I would agree with a lot of other posters that it is really glorified camping. But, the ambiance is wonderful, the rooms are very well designed, and they do provide you with a lot of extras that most places do not. You must be prepared for the bugs and willing do deal with them. We had an amazing Honeymoon and Hix Island House definitely contributed to that.

Especially if you get to see the infinity pool at the owners' cottage (which is not for public use). Hix is what I would call luxury camping, in that you get the best of the outdoors with very little of the downside. However, if you are the type to get annoyed at a few mosquitoes or tiny ants in the kitchen or bathroom, or having to do a few dishes after using the kitchen, then this may not be the place for you. For me and my husband, though, the simplicity of our stay there brought us to a calmer place, and having to do small tasks like washing a few dishes or taking out the trash helped me to feel more grounded. We chose this place because they offered yoga every day, and both yoga teachers -Jen and Maureen - were fabulous in their own way (they offered Vinyasa and Amrit yoga). The yoga pavilion is a raised platform with no walls and a corrugated roof. The breeze made it feel amazing. It's hard to top practicing with the birds and beautiful foliage all around you. Maureen also gives excellent massages, which you can book through the front desk. It may have been the best massage of my life. After the massage, she was able to give me special attention in yoga class because she knew my strengths and weaknesses. There is no TV, so my husband downloaded some shows and movies, which we watched on his laptop. The beaches in Vieques are beautiful, but the room with its chaise lounges is so relaxing that we didn't feel like we had to leave in order to enjoy our stay, which was that much more relaxing. This is one of my top vacations ever. We spent a week there. Hix staff were so kind as to upgrade our room, possibly because of the length of our stay and the lack of other patrons at the time. One night we were the only guests at Hix. This was not an issue for us, as everyone pretty much keeps to themselves. Another highlight was the cocktail hour at the owners cottage. We met some nice people and dined with another couple. There were many guests and residents from Massachusetts, like us. Another highlight was a 2-hour horseback ride across the Island.

The grounds were so tranquil the entire time, and our Casa Rectangular loft was perfect in every way. The concept of an open-air room didn't fully hit us until that first night we fell asleep to the sounds of leaves and birds with a cool ocean breeze coming through. Also, the morning sun is that much more intense with no window to diffuse its rays. We saw only one mosquito the final night, but the large net hanging above the bed makes a handy fortress. There is also a garage-style hurricane shutter you can lower in times of rain, which we used only once on a chilly night. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the necessary utensils and staples for making breakfast, along with good Puerto Rican coffee and freshly baked bread. The staff was very accommodating, and seemed to carry a happiness about them simply by being in constant contact with this lovely oasis. Our favorite room activities by far were bathing in the private outdoor shower under the stars, and sun worshipping on the raised concrete deck with a nice ocean view.

The loft also had a charcoal grill and lounge chairs on a private sunning area on the roof. Brenda, the woman at the front desk, was eager to help us with anything and everything and took care of all of our reservations -- from dinner to the biobay tour, etc. I would strongly urge anyone going there to: 1) rent a car (we thought we could get by with bikes but you really need a car to get to the secluded beaches); 2) stop by the front desk each morning to chat with Brenda about the local \"news\" (i.e., by doing this we got a heads up that the restaurant we planned to go to one night had decided not to open and that the ferry was having mechanical problems); 3) travel to/from by plane because the ferries are totally unreliable and the flights are really cheap and much faster. We took a plane there, but had planned to take the ferry back. Even though the ferry was supposedly fixed by then, it never showed up and we had to scramble to try to find a plane at the last minute. Naturally, so did everyone else that had planned to take the ferry so alot of the flights were already full and we almost ended up being stranded there for another night after we had checked out of Hix and had non-refundable reservations in Fajardo.

Once we checked out the Hix website, we were convinced it would be amazing. Our expectations were far exceeded!! First of all, it's breath-taking and beautiful -- the landscape, the architecture, and the peaceful seclusion were just what we wanted. As soon as we arrived we said we would return. We stayed in Loft 1 which is HUGE and beautifully decorated!!! The table could seat 6 and there is a huge open window/ledge overlooking the pool. The outdoor shower is a spectacular addition. The bathroom also has double sinks and very nice Rusk shampoo/conditioner. The hanging bed is a wonderful spot to nap in the sun (and I believe that Loft 1 is the only loft to have one). Our actual bed was the most comfortable thing ever! We were only at Hix for two nights (we seriously considered extending our stay but a wedding party was coming in and we couldn't). Our two nights felt like much, much longer because it's just so relaxing. It's heavenly, really. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, cups, plates, silverware etc. The fruit/eggs/bread/coffee/juices in our fridge every day were so nice. We went to the Green Market shop to pick up a couple of other things, but otherwise had plenty of food provided for breakfast. We were also appreciative of the use of beach chairs, cooler bags, robes and towels they provided for us. As most other posts say, there are no screens on the doors/windows. We did not have any problems with bugs at all. (We were there in late June.) However, they do provide bug spray and candles if there are bugs and the mosquito net over the bed. You can also close the big window/garage door, if need-be. The pool is breathtaking -- there's a reason it's been voted the Best Pool in Vieques. Brenda, in reception, was wonderfully helpful both before and during our stay. She set up the Bio Bay tour tickets for us (which we highly recommend) and told us about the best restaurant in town - El Quenepo - where we had a delicious and romantic meal! Hi Brenda!

As far as Vieques, I recommend renting a 4 wheel drive and exploring the beaches and towns. Red Beach and Blue Beach were our favorites, but the more popular Sun Bay Beach was beautiful too. I recommend doing the bio bay tour, but make sure to check the moon phase first. The tour guides at Island Adventures were knowledgeable, funny and friendly.

It's very much a matter of taste, no doubt that Hix is not your standard hotel experience. So I understand why some may find it not to their liking, but if you have a proper understanding of what you're getting, then then disappointments shouldn't be an issue. I've tried to add some items which haven't been covered previously. We came from Hell to Heaven: after a 4-day conference in Fajardo, at El Conquistador, Hix stood out as phenomenal. We (a couple in our early 30's) we're getting nausious, depressed and fed up with the massiveness of El Conquistador, it's thousands of noisy guests, ringing and dinging Casino, and where just happy to get away from it. So Hix, being the exact opposite, was a true blessing. It's true that you will need a car. Book well in advance, as most places are fully booked fast. We ended up getting a car from Raphael at Acevedos Car Rental. A very decent Ford Explorer. The pictures from both the Hix website, as well as from the other reviewers give a good understanding of what it is, but as a lot of the Hix experience is tranquility, it's really hard to catch that in a still photo. The front desk is VERY helpful (we met Bob & Joanne), but don't forget to ask. They're not intrusive in trying to lure your wishes and desires, so just ask if there's anything you need, or something you need help on figuring out. Worst thing that can happen is a no. We stayed at Loft 5 for 3 nights, and then at Loft 1 for 2 nights. Loft 1 is quite a lot bigger, has two sinks in the bathroom, two sinks in the kitchen, a little desk, a hanging mattress by the patio, and in general is a lot more spacious than Loft 5. It's almost too big for two people. Loft 5 was nice, more simple but great as well. A simple square room with kitchen, bed and patio. Both great rooms. No problems with heat, the ceiling fan along with the outside breeze is quite perfect. I could only reach an internet signal while at the front desk, which actually was OK as it forced a bit more relaxation, and less work. We did a Eco Tour with Abes snorkling, doing the mangroves, snorkling, secluded beach and ending off with the Bio Bay. $100/person, lasting from 2 p.m. till approx 8 p.m. A great trip. El Quenepo is great for dinner. On Sundays the BBH serves an excellent brunch. There are two things would make the Hix experience better: firstly, a daily maid service, just to make the bed, clean the dishes etc. would be great. It's not a cheap place, so it wouldn't hurt with that little service. It's actually great and very much in tune with the whole atmosphere that there isn't roomservice etc. etc., but as the room can get messy after 2 or 3 days, it would be nice with a little bit of service. Secondly (and a very minor thing): a toaster in each room. There's fresh bread every day, but some of us like to toast it a bit, if for no other reason than for variation.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "dalideigh", "ReviewID": "UR18146224", "Content": "We spent a week at this most unusal and pleasant hotel on a most unusual and pleasant island.

We had a wonderful time! I'll admit that after reading some reviews, I was really concerned about bugs, lizards, etc, but I was really comfortable there. We saw very few bugs, and only a few very tiny lizards. The lizards stayed over near the patio and the entryway, and never came near the bed or closet areas, so they really were not a problem. The Hix Island House is very clean and extremely peaceful. There are no TVs, clocks, radios or internet access within the rooms, which is exactly what we wanted! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The women who worked at the front desk were both great - they gave us directions, recommendations, and helped us by booking a trip to the bio bay. The landscaping around the hotel grounds is gorgeous. We were on the ground level and had flowering bushes surrounding our patio. The hotel is inland, so the view of the ocean was extremely limited, but we still thought we had beautiful scenery. Staying here was a fabulous experience! Sleeping in the fresh air, with the sounds of the birds and the wind, was great! We woke one morning to rain, and loved it - the sound and smell of the rain was a great way to wake up! I would suggest buying groceries and planning to eat in the room for several of your meals (there's a full kitchen). There is only one restaurant that is very nearby, but it was closed when we tried to go there (which was around 5:00 on a weeknight, so they must have irregular hours). The hotel is about a 10-minute drive from the nearest town, which isn't a bad drive but it did become a little tedious when we had to make the drive multiple times each day. One more suggestion is to try to arrive before 5:00 pm. We arrived after dark. We had been told that the office would be closed. As promised, there was an envelope waiting for us, with our name on it, with the key to the room and directions for getting from the office to the room (the office is in a separate building from the 3 buildings that house the rooms).

It was fantastic, it was private, our massages were great, the pool was refreshing, and our room was bug free, even though everything is open to the sky! Staff, especially front desk manager Brenda, are the tops. Fresh fruit, juices and baked breads were delivered to our room every day. Weekly cocktail parties at the owners' extraordinary villa gave us a chance to meet the others staying on the compound and hob nob with John Hix and family, the creative inspriation behind Hix Island House. We cooked in the apartment half the time, but got a chance to try out new restaurants on the Island during the rest of the ten days- which was very easy to do since Vieques is such a small island. Our favorite was La Campesena. Vieques is a bit quirky as an island, but what an easy place to get to from the northeast. All in all, the vacation was a value since a 15% discount was offered since we stayed more than a week.

We stayed in the Adobe Loft, which was on the ground floor with a very private patio on which we got massages one afternoon. The trip was one of the most relaxing I have ever had and our stay was a centerpoint for that. The Hix House is actually several different buildings, each with three or four \"lofts\" constructed of concrete with unglazed windows. Every loft has some form of private outdoor space and many have outdoor showers. The buildings are designed to interface smoothly with the natural surroundings and as a result there are all manner of plant and (small) animal life around. We frequently saw lizards in our room and there was a set of black hummingbirds hard at work pollinating the trees on our patio. At night, the surroundings are pitch black and the only sounds you hear are insects chirping and the wind rushing through trees. The sky is so clear that you can actually see the Milky Way, a rarity for us city-dwellers. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. They made good recommendations for beaches for various purposes (reading books, snorkeling, bodysurfing, etc) and restaurants. They had snorkel equipment for us to borrow and a couple of boogie-boards as well. Every day they would stock the fridge with food to prepare for breakfast: local eggs, fresh baked bread, fresh fruit, jam, butter, milk, coffee, etc. We were also able to supplement this with some fruit from the trees on the grounds. Overall, this was one of the best vacation spots I have ever been to. It is not the place for you if you equate luxury with sterility or people pampering you and scuttling about like servants.

There were no battles for chairs or getting up at 6am to put your towel on a \"reserved chair\". The pool is the perfect place to cool off and read in a quiet setting. The Hix Island house is defintely not your typical \"all inclusive\" hotel. It is not a food-factory, or day camp! We actually loved trying out all the restaurants in the downtown area.

Brenda at the desk was so helpful and hooked us up with the Bio Bay tour (Blue Caribe, which I highly recommend\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso friendly and amazing), a massage in the loft (heaven), a $30 ginormous Puerto Rican meal that we picked up from their neighbor (it lasted us lunch and dinner and was incredible), and directions to every possible place we could as for. The location is great\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsecluded, but still pretty central to anywhere you need to go. Definitely rent a car\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe had an SUV from Maritzas, who had good prices and were so easy to work with. They took us to the ferry after we dropped the car off, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hassle us about anything. The SUV got us pretty much everywhere we needed to go, although there was one time we had to turn around because the road got too bad. We would definitely pay extra and get a Jeep next time, since exploring the beaches was the most fun of everything and I think we would have gone to a couple even more remote ones if we had 4WD. But an SUV was definitely sufficient for almost everything. The Room: the pictures don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lie\u00e2\u20ac\u201dour room was spacious, modern, incredibly hip and surprisingly comfortable. The bed was so soft and the sheets and pillows were heavenly. The outdoor shower was also a great bonus, as the views are amazing. We were in Loft 5, which I personally thought was one of the best ones. All of the views were incredible (you could see the ocean, mountains, forests, and lots of lovely sky) and since we were on the top floor, everything felt very private (although there were only two other couples staying at Hix while we were there, so it was pretty private anyways). The amenities in the room were also great\u00e2\u20ac\u201dplush towels, soft button-down Neeva Gayle shirts, along with robes and all the usual bathroom stuff (if you need a hair dryer, just ask and the front desk will gladly give you one). The kitchen had everything you could possibly need to cook with (pots, pans, dishes, olive oil, hot sauce, salt/pepper, a colander, utensils, knives, coffee grinder, French press), as well as the breakfast items that you could request more of each day by writing down what you need on the clipboard at the front desk: homemade bread (such a great snack, we went through two loaves), an assortment of fruit, eggs, pineapple juice, orange juice, milk, cereal, brita water pitcher, jelly, tea, fresh coffee beans. We picked up some cheese and other stuff from the big supermarket near Isabel Segunda (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the map you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get at the front desk) and made omelettes each morning. We also cooked dinner and packed our lunches for our beach day excusions, which worked out wonderfully. Other room amenities: trivial pursuit, Scrabble, chess, bug spray, sunscreen, extra blankets, mosquito-away coils (these worked great, we burned one at each end of the room each night), tealights, lighters, beach towels, beach cooler bag, beach chairs\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.we even borrowed fins from the office on our last day so we could snorkel out to the island in front of Esperanza. The pool at Hix is beautiful and so relaxing, and fit right into the landscape with everything else. Some general Vieques tips: Esperanza is a lot of fun at night\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe went to Bananas (very good food) and Duffy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (lots of friendly expats hang out here), and walked along the Malecon (boardwalk). Isabel Segunda is fun to sightsee for half a day (the lighthouse, the fort both have beautiful views and fun exhibits), though a little tricky to drive around. The bugs weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really an issue at Hix, but we probably helped by only using candles once it got dark so that they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attracted to large amounts of light. The mosquito net for the bed is huge, and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel constraining at all (it helps if you tuck the corners under the edges of the bed). Use the mosquito coils and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave food out\u00e2\u20ac\u201dobviously Hix is not for everyone (if you want a cheesy resort with planned events, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it here), but we felt like we were living in a dream the entire time. Allot most of your time for exploring beaches\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere is a breakdown a ways back in one of the previous reviews that gives the best details and locations, so I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try to match that. Our favorite beaches: Playa Navio, Red Beach, Green Beach (4WD definitely helps), Media Luna (for swimming) and Garcia Beach. Also, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up to it and have fins, definitely try to go across to the island in front of Esperanza for snorkelling. Head out in front of where Blue Caribe is and go to the right (southwest) side of the island where all the rocks are. The reef is amazing there (we saw so many incredible fish, nurse sharks, gorgeous coral), though it is a bit of a swim. The conclusion? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re definitely going back, and next time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re bringing friends. This was the perfect place to start our honeymoon, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re even thinking about going to Vieques/Hix, do it.

For one of the first times in my travels, the hotel lived up to the preconceptions and expectations I had created before my trip. To start, our hosts were Diane, Michael, and Joanne, three of the nicest people on the island as far as I'm concerned. Diane checked us in and led us to our place, Matisse, located in the Triangle House. Along the way, she even picked some fresh lemons and brought them up to the house for us. When you get to your room, there are plenty of windows, but no glass. No Air Con, but an amazing fan. The whole concept of the place is to fit into nature peacefully and disturb it as little as possible. And you honestly get that feel once you set foot in your space. Mosquito nets tastefully hang over the beds (and you're instructed how to use them correctly!), a lovely table with chairs, full kitchen with everything you would need to create your own meals (even some eggs for breakfast and fresh loaves of bread daily!!!), coffee press & beans, etc. The pool area is to die for. Clean water, beautiful views, and many times when you are totally alone! Quite rare at an island resort! I think we even spotted a concrete ping pong table a ways off into the woods. Mr. Hix did an incredible job with the design and execution of his vision. This hotel is NOT for someone looking for a pool boy serving daiquiris, a person with high maintenance needs, or your average tourist. This place is for someone looking to get away and escape. Be alone, without distraction of TV or radios... My point is that you shouldn't stay here if you like staying at a W and having a tub full of pink M&M's on arrival. This is for something looking for a bit more out of their trip than extravagance and excess. I never wanted to leave. I look back at the photos and wish I were still there. I have never felt this way about a hotel before. I want to return again and again! The Island of Vieques is unreal. If you are looking for a spot not burdened with tourists and chain restaurants, and to get a real taste of a Caribbean island, then head here for sure!

Puerto Rican's have a saying that loosely translates to \"If it is packed with people, then you can be sure it's good\"; we also ate at the BBH Hotel.

It was comparable to a NY City restaurant and was located by the pool of the hotel (the Martini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so hot!). Many beaches are located down long dirt roads often filled with water holes and mud pits. GET A JEEP! It can be an adventure getting to the beach, but once there the solitude is breath taking. (Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to wash your jeep to avoid fees!) At the recommendation of Diane, one of the managers of the Hix House, we went to Blue beach for some snorkeling. She not only described it to a T, but we even found our way out to a deserted coral reef island. There is a beautiful little beach out there. Amazing!

Now, you may think: Is this vacation place for purists, poetically inclined, eco-minded people?

For example, you will get an atypically spacious room (only 13 of them) furnished with artful (and useful!) original accessories of world known designers. Thus, if you open up to the aesthetically pleasing surroundings, you are bound to get in touch with your relaxation responses (a short distance to stress decompression) without excluding basic earthy conveniences. Follow me? Wining and dining has never tasted better (if you look well, in Vieques you can find almost any fine gourmet goods to satisfy a sophisticated palate). And then, you have a very short distance access to some of the most astonishing beaches in the Caribbean to let yourself go. What a treasure! We will definitely return in the future.

Even the room amenities were way above (and more thoughtful) than other places we've stayed in the Caribbean. For example, in addition to the usual niceties like aromatic hand soaps and shampoos, our room at Hix also had some surprising and very useful extras: lanterns, bed-side fans, beach chairs/coolers, bug spray and most impressively a well-stocked kitchen. But it was the managers -- Diane and Mike -- that made this vacation one of our best island stays yet. Thanks to their restaurant recommendations and skilled reservation making, we ate extremely well (go to Uva for one of the best island meals you'll ever have) and found gorgeous beaches (Blue Beach for great snorkeling).

Our white towels and robes had stains on them so we asked for new ones and they were very nice about changing them. All of this would be okay if it was slightly cheaper, but it is one of the most expensive places to stay on the island. Additionally, despite the throw on the bed having a colorful pattern, a stain was still visible on it. The concept is peacefulness so there is no maid service, and if you want anything you have to request it at the front desk which is only open between 9 and 5.

We stayed at the Hix Island House. The room was the 'Adobe Triangular Room'. Even the being on the lower level, showering, watching humming birds dance from lush flower to flower is quite the experience. The windows do not have glass panes, and have wood shutters. it is absolutely raw at its core, so it allows you to engulf the breath-taking surroundings of nature. Echoes of the coqui (the local frog), is absolutely relaxing under the moonlit sky. You can plan all you want, by trying to plan your activities ahead of time. But Brenda at the front desk will gladly help you out with the real deal. She made our trip all the more romantic and exciting with her careful recommendations for dinner, beaches, and the BioBay (which we missed regretfully). Also being a yoga newbie, I couldn't resist taking a class in the morning on the premises. Closing your eyes, breathing and hearing all that nature around you, again...is just amazing. Maybe it's being a city boy, that when I see flowers so rich in color, sounds of birds and coqui, geckos crawling everywhere, and seeing horses in the middle of the road...it's just so exciting. If you want to experience something out of the ordinary, totally relaxed, and absolutely amazing, I highly highly recommend the HIX Island House. The hotel is beautiful, the pool is beautiful, the surroundings are beautiful, and the staff are super friendly.

Overall, a wonderful experience worthy of many return stays. Considering the positive reviews left by other reviewers, I'll just fill in some blanks on HIH/Vieques that may yet have gone unaddressed by others. * Room. We stayed at the Studio in Casa Triangular, which is where John Hix stayed for more than a decade before HIH was turned into a hotel. Diane/Brenda/Joanne basically said this unit was John's favorite. It must be so considering all the pictures of it featured in the book of John's works (autographed versions sell for $20 at the front desk). Now, contrary to the photos you see on the website (as of 3/13/2006), you do not have a full panorama of waters surrounding Vieques. In the units' line of sight stands a huge Mimosa tree. We were not much disappointed since this tradeoff of view (of easily reachable beaches) vs usability (hammocks that sway with the trade winds now tied to the trees) was a worthwhile one. * Accessibility. As any of the hotel staff would tell you, a car is NECESSARY. You can practically drive to anywhere you'd want to go on the island w/i 15 minutes (aside to/from Green Beach, which was not worth the trip given that its isolation and that we allocated 1 day to beach hop / snorkel). We rented a 2007 PT Cruiser convertible (Touring Edition, 2.4L Turbo) from Martineau Car Rental (almost across from Martinuea Resort; walkable). Now, Martineau was to have us picked up from VQS (which was 5 minutes away from it), yet we waited for 30 minutes only to get to Martineau via publico ($3/p). Martineau was kind enough to throw in a 7% discount on the rental, only to overcharge by 34% when I looked at my cc bill. Lesson here is to make sure to save all your receipts and to be VERY thorough when you do the car inspection upon first receiving the car (take photos if you must; we did but only because we like taking photos of everything). If you're a planner like me, you probably tried (and failed) looking for driving maps for Vieques destinations. Turned out HIH front desk will give you the only good and useful driving map of Vieques. There is no need to waste time finding good maps of Vieques online (and MS Streets and Trips '07, iGuidance 3.0, or Garmin City Navigator US v8 won't have anything good either). All you really need is just the one map that Brenda/Joanne will gladly give you. Now, if you want to plan a bit using the computer nonetheless, use wayhoo.com to get the GPS coordinates of some of the locales and enter them into MSST. Unfortunately, we forgot to get the coords for HIH so can't help you there. Nevertheless, everything is accessible enough that this level of planning is not necessary. You will not get lost easily while on Vieques. * Amenities. The unit came with a well stocked fridge. We had coffee, honey, tea bags, a dozen eggs, 4 mini-cans of Lotus brand OJ and 4 mini-cans of pineapple juice, a Brita water jug, and a good assortment of fruits. We drove to the nearby Green Market and bought cheese and ham to make omelettes in the morning. What would have been great is if HIH stocked Coqui Fire hot sauce (locally made; [--]) in the units, as Green Market was all out of it when we went. FYI, you can try many of the flavors at Belly Buttons at Esperanza waterfront, however. Neither Island Steakhouse nor Chez Shack had any. Lastly, the room also came with lotsa books in case you forgot to bring some, as well as a chess set, scrabble, candle-lit lanterns, and bug spray! * Activities. We spent what equated to 2 days in Vieques. In my mind, this was the appropriate amount if you also plan to visit the main island (which we did for 3 days). Having days starting at 8AM (sun rises at 6:45AM) and ending by sundown @ 7PM, this was our trip allocation: * One full day for beach exploration / snorkel / bum. See 'Beaches' for details. * Half day for Abe's all-in-one biobay/kayak/snorkel tour. See \"Abe's' for details. * Half day bumming @ HIH * Quarter day driving around getting to know Vieques. See 'Accessibility' above for details. * Abe's Biobay. [--] There's quite a few options from which to choose for bioluminescent bay tour. We picked Abe's because they were the only one to offer an all-in-one option, combining kayaking, snorkeling, mangrove traversing, and biobay swim. A good deal at $90/person, we met at Belly Buttons @ 1PM, stopped by Green Market to get more beverages, and headed off driving to Mosquito Bay to start our kayak trip across the bay into the mangroves. Kayak across the bay was pretty exhausting but definitely worth it if you don't want to just lounge your days away. Be sure to try some mangrove oysters - very salty but delicious. Abe will chuck them for you. After the mangrove tour, we continued to kayak to Novillo Beach - the secluded beach accessible only by kayak. It was there that we snorkeled for about 1.5 hours. Beach dinner by the sunset was large coldcut subs prepared by Belly Buttons with chips and Caprisun. Be sure to feed the 'pet fish' as they're used to being fed around 6:30PM and will follow you wherever you go. We then headed off in the dark back to the bay where we witnessed the truly amazing dinoflagellates sparkle like little diamonds at night. This is one of those experiences that no digicam can ever capture. * Food / restaurants. We cooked our own breakfast everyday during our stay. A little mouse also joined us one morning and it scurried across the unit. No wonder the wonderful homemade bread was stored in a tupperware. For dinner, we dined at Chez Shack for its Monday BBQ grill night with live music ($35/person after-tax, for entree + beer + AYCE salad bar). Be sure to call in advance to reserve seats, though we'd actually recommend Island Steakhouse AYCE BBQ dinner ($35/person after-tax, for pina colada + AYCE entree). Island's tasted better, did not have overly loud music or slow service, and was not as \"shacky\" feeling. (Island's menu consisted of honey corn bread, pulled pork, chicken, baby back ribs, jalape\u00c3\u00b1o mashed potatoes, and corn on the cob). * Wireless internet. You can either use the iMac at the front desk (that closes at 5PM), or if try to get some weak signals using the 54Mbps wireless connection from the office. Our unit was farthest away from the office unit yet still managed to stream some internet radio with only minor buffering. I hope HIH would spend $50 and get a signal extender. As my gf called it, I suffered from some minor internet withdrawal. * Weather. During the day, temperature remained in the low 80s for the entire trip. Be sure to put on SPF 50 (we only used 15 and 30) since UV gets through cloudy days almost as well as clear days. At night, there was abs no need for AC as the tradewinds really cooled the unit. The gf had the fan off at one point since she got too cold. Only one instance when it rained one night @ 7:30PM for 10 minutes as we rushed to finished building our sand 'castle'. We wished it'd rain a bit more as we did not hear any coqui songs (though we did manage to capture two coquis in the outdoor shower area!) * Beaches. Below is all the information I gathered while searching for beaches. I did not write some of them but figured to save readers time by aggregating what helped us. Favorite was probably Media Luna since that was where I saw a 4ft Mantaray at 4ft of glistening waters. And the sand was fine enough to build detailed sand castles (which we also did, given that my gf's an architect). I've included GPS coords for your convenience. Overview: [--] snorkel: [--] & [--] All the Beaches on Vieques are dependent on the wind direction on any particular day. If the winds are from the Southeast then the North Coast Beaches will be nicer. If the wind is blowing from the Northeast then head for the South Coast Beaches!

Playa Negrita (black sand) \u00c2\u00b7 Head towards La Hueca, which is located on the southwestern part of the island. From Esperanza head west, you will pass Casa Vieja Art Gallery on your left, slow down and start looking for a dirt road path on your left. You will see a big boulder on this dirt road. You will be driving towards the edge of a cliff, find a place to park around there. Grab your camera, your sandals, put on some sunscreen and walk down a walkway on your left. You will just walk and walk around the coast until you find the black sand beach. I was extremely desperate to get there, but do take your time, it is a beautiful walk towards the beach. As I mentioned earlier you will have to work your way around rock walls. The bottom of the beach is rocky and can get slippery so please walk around with care. Playa Esperanza (for snorkeling) \u00c2\u00b7 Right in front of Trade Winds Guesthouse \u00c2\u00b7 Very easy access for snorkeling Green Beach (for seclusion & snorkel) \u00c2\u00b7 Take the road all the way to the end where it \"Ts\" and then go left (it's a pretty rough road) \u00c2\u00b7 Go all the way to the last \"cut out\" that leads to the beach. \u00c2\u00b7 Walk to your right about 90 ~ 120 ft then go in the water (too much sharp coral and \"sea porcupines\" in front of the cut out). \u00c2\u00b7 Once in the water swim out about 120 ~ 180 ft and swim to your left. There's a great reef out there and I've seen everything you can see in the water out there: all the fish, turtles, sting rays, manta rays, lobsters, and once a fairly big nurse shark (a couple of years ago). \u00c2\u00b7 Need to leave by 4PM to avoid midges \u00c2\u00b7 Great drive to get there, have to pass Kiani Lagoon mangroves", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back\u201d", "Author": "emdawg", "ReviewID": "UR7350040", "Content": "This posting can't possibly express my esteem and admiration for what the folks at Hix Island House have put together, but I'll do my best.

We'll be going back--I don't think we could stay away even if we wanted to. Regarding the service, I'll say this: If you want to feel completely alone, and not be bothered for any reason whatsoever, they'll accomodate you. However, if you need them for anything, they will be there in spades. We unwittingly booked a room on the busiest weekend of the year and couldn't find a rental car or a scooter or even a bike to get around the island. When we realized this might be a problem, we simply called them and I know they tried to track one down for us every day the week prior to our arrival and had pulled off the impossible by the time we landed. When it came time for us to leave the evening of Easter Sunday, a Hix cartaker came to our door two hours before we were to depart and told us our cab driver was getting soused on the beach and wasn't coming. So they drove us to the airport and refused payment! The folks at Hix don't seem to be about taking your money, though I know they're running a business.

If you're willing to pay for the priviledge of access rather than service or amenities, Hix Island House delivers. The architecture and setting are spare and soothing: one experiences a sense of spaciousness there, inpart because the lofts are so much bigger than any hotel room. My partner and I stayed at the Hix Island House for one week and while we enjoyed our visit--the staff is warm, the setting spectacular-- I think it would have been better if I had known the following: While the linens and the prices charged are high-end, the food provided is basic: Letty is a lovely woman and the bread she bakes is good, not great; the juice was canned; the butter was in pre-packaged pats; the jam was from Smucker's; the milk is Parmalat. Add coffee and fruit to this and that is the sum of what you get. So pack your own treats if you're into having a bigger or better selection than what's offered. (We bought greens and muesli from the healthfood store and milk and other groceries from the large grocery store in Isabel Segunda.) Fancier foods --goat cheese, crackers, fiji water, etc... are available at Hix Island House, at the reception desk, for a typically steep hotel-mini-bar price. I would suggest to the management that this stash of food be offered to guests free of charge. It sounds generous, but I think it's only fair, considering the provisions are quite basic. All the restaurants that we were sent to: Chez Shack, Richard's Cafe, Trade Winds, Mama Sanga's -- sucked. Bright Side: We enjoyed the pool and highly recommend the daily yoga lessons with Jennifer. I would also suggest staying in a loft on the 2nd floor or higher; you'll get more light. Vieques itself is a magical place. The people are proud and friendly. Wild horses roam the island and sometimes it seems there are more horses than people. Visit the bioluminescent bay: it's a wonder. The best beach is Red Beach, but make sure you wear sandals: there are prickers in the sand. It's a nice drive out to Green Beach, but it's better for snorkeling than swimming. The best food is at the road-side stands that are open near Sun Bay beach and in the parking lot in downtown Esperanza on Thursdays-Sundays. Chez shack is fine on grill night, but not worth it otherwise. Go to El Quenepo in Esperanza, it is the best of the high-end restaurants.

The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful with reservations. We missed our flight out to Vieques due to our own stupidity (did not realize about the time difference and failed to change our watches to local time). Both the hotel and rental car company (Island) were very helpful since they both close at 5pm and we were arriving at 5:30. Island Rental Car delivered our car to the hotel and our car key and hotel key were left in an envelope on the door of the reception area. Our room was stocked with fruit, eggs, bread and other great food. I was hoping that the fruit would be a little more \"local\" but for the most part it was fruit that I could have bought at home with the stickers on them (plums, apples, pears, oranges, and lemons). There were not very many bugs, which I think is a seasonal thing. I don't think that I could go to this hotel during the wet, buggy season. The outdoor shower was wonderful. For the most part my husband and I felt like we spent a lot of money to go high class camping. We had to be cautious of turning on lights for too long because we didn't want to attract bugs, and I had to read by candlelight under the mosquito net. Our mosquito net could have used a bit of maintenance. There were holes the size of my fist and others the size of my head that would definitely not keep out bugs. I had to try to strategically cover these up, which became a science. There are also adorable lizards living in the rooms, but don't worry they are great. They eat many of the bugs! Another house guest that you will have are mice. We had at least one mouse living in our stove who would come out at night to eat everything. He took a bite of all of the pieces of fruit in the fruit bowl and ate some candy that I had in a plastic bag on my night table. On our last day we heard a lady above us screaming because she found a mouse in her purse. I guess that is nature for you. The pool was nice and warm. A few of the bulbs were out, which made it a little difficult for night swimming, but overall it was nice to have and generally there were no people at the pool when I was in it. The restaurants around the island are really pricey and not really worth the money. We went to Chez Shak (right down the street from the hotel and highly recommended by hotel staff) and I must say that it was WAY OVERPRICED for what we got. The food was good, but we left starving because the portions were so small. My husband and I had two sodas (we don't drink) and swordfish for me and another fish dish for him. The bill came to about $80 including tip, which for the amount of food we got (tiny thin piece of fish and a little squash) is too expensive. We also ate at Tradewinds (decent), Duffy's for lunch (expensive and owned by the same people as Chez Shak, but okay) and M Bar (expensive and not recommended, my fish was overcooked). Overall, the best food that we had was at an authentic Puerto Rican small restaurant on the side of the road. It was reasonably priced and not the same old food that every other restaurant was serving at high prices. For the beaches, we went to Sun Bay (public beach) - very nice calm beach and can park right at the sand edge, Navio Beach - our favorite because the waves were great fun to play in but a lot of seaweed, Red Beach - small beach with shack like cabanas that fill up early but provide nice shade, Secret Beach - small secluded beach, fun to watch the crabs walking along the sand and Green Beach - rocky beach good for snorkeling only. Hopefully this helps give you some ideas about the hotel and island. The architechture is worth seeing because it is impressive and the breezes are nice. Other hotels on the island are also expensive, so it may be worth it to you to spend a little extra and stay at Hix for the \"experience.\" In the end, I must say that I was a little relieved to get back to my own house and bed without mice and bugs to worry about.", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "Groodle", "ReviewID": "UR6918016", "Content": "I have never written a review of anything before, but I had such a fantastic stay at this hotel, I felt compelled.

In addition to booking my room, she was also extremely helpful in explaining flight (we ended up taking Cape Air from San Juan International) and SUV rental options and provided me with their cell phone number in case we had any problems in our travels. I took her up on the offer before I even arrived at the hotel. Despite their clear directions, we managed to take a wrong turn on our way to the hotel. Mike, patiently helped us figure out where we were (near the island's main village, Isabella) and guided us to the hotel. Upon arrival, we fell in love with the architecture. I've never been anywhere like it before. The hotel's three main guest buildings (the aptly named Casa Redona, Casa Triangular, and Casa Rectangular) are even more stunning than they appear in the pictures. While we expected to be awed by the architecture, we had underestimated the serenity and natural beauty of the setting. Hix carefully situated the buildings into the hillside in such a way that each provides its handful of units with privacy, yet each are only steps away from the pool, check-in building, and yoga platform. The subtle, yet well maintained landscaping is the icing on the cake. I concur with previous revierws' accolades. The managers and staff\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhile providing all of the personal service we could ask for (and we did)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwere never intrusive. In fact, the personal attention was a key reason that our brief visit to Vieques was packed with fond memories. Not only did they guide us to several great meals at the island's restaurants, they told us who to ask for at each one. Of particularly note was nearby Chez Shack\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich we, following Diane's recommendation, we reached via a spectacular moonlit walk. The restaurant's friendly staff (yes, it is a shack, but with one of the island's top chefs), were particularly attentive when we told them that the Hix House had sent us. Mike helped us with our reservation to explore bioluminescent Mosquito Bay (a Vieques-must-do) and directions to many of the island's secluded beaches\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding our favorite, Blue Beach. The staff was consistently friendly and all seemed to genuinely enjoy their work. JoAnne was a wealth of information about the island. A final note\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the managers' 3-year old standard poodle, Porter, was a particular joy for my girlfriend, as he reminded her of her childhood dog. He reminded us why we went to the Carribean in the first place\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6to play!

It is a wonderful alternative to any other hotel experience. It is luxurious and spartan at the same time. The units have stocked kitchens and ample common space. The luxury linens are always clean and replenished as needed. No one comes to knock on the door daily to say \"housekeeping!\" which has always irked me. Nor does anyone slip into the units unless requested. Warm homemade bread greets you as you arrive and other basic staples are available such as coffee beans, coffee grinder, French press, and all the accessory items for a nice cup of tea too.

It was the best vacation we've ever had. The following items contributed: 1. The architecture. The concrete building material, the design (high ceilings, clean lines) greatly contributed to our feeling of well-being. It was like being at the newly renovated Museum of Modern Art in New York - no matter where you were in the unit, the visual impact was perfect. The bathroom and outdoor shower area was a dream. The space always looked great no matter how cluttered it got when we left clothes on the ledge and chairs and shoes (sometimes muddy) on the floor. The space is \"good for your mind.\" 2. The comfort. The bed was great and bed linens wonderful as were the towels, robes and beach blankets. We loved Neeva Gayle's big shirts (and bought 2 black ones to bring home with us. I'm wearing mine right now). The kitchen was designed and appointed extremely well - well enough that we cooked all our breakfasts and 3 out of 5 dinners there (and sat under the stars on our patio and ate them with chilled bottles of Chilean red wine). We made sandwiches with the wonderful freshly baked bread for lunch (we grilled it first, it was good cold-grilled) and took them to the beach a couple of times together with some of the generous amounts of fruit that they provide (upon request). We also used the great beach chairs one day and sat at Sun Bay Beach for 3 hours. 3. The environment. It was, indeed, very romantic. You felt like you were one with nature and we often just sat outdoors on our ocean view patio quietly listening to the sounds and breathing the beautiful, jasmine scented air. The only time of day when it was too hot and bright to be on the patio was during lunch and then we would bring the small dining table and chairs indoors, close to the door opening, and have our lunch in the cool bunker-like indoor environment, with the door wide open. The shower, as I mentioned, was heavenly with a full ocean view and a wide ledge where you could place your cooling drink (i.e. a late afternoon beer) while you showered. The pool was divine - very low in chemicals and beautifully designed. I was there early every morning for my exercise and there was never anybody else there. We also took a wonderful, romantic evening swim one night under the stars (pool is open until 11pm). 4. Very importantly: the people who own the place and the staff who work there. John Hix, the architect, is a genious (sorry to embarrass you John). His wife Neeva Gayle, is also a genious. They are absolutely great, caring, people and we feel like our lives are richer for having met them. In my opinion the item \"service\" includes the philosophy behind the place and my husband and I love the philosophy behind the Hix Island House: nature can't be controlled and the best way to enjoy nature on your vacation is to be close to it, not sealed off from it. Here you are close to it in a beautiful, comfortable environment. All the people we met who worked there: Diane, Brenda, Joan, were absolutely wonderful and helped us with everything we asked for - made reservations, replenished our room, gave us directions. As far as the replenishing is concerned, that's what made it such a great value for us because we got as much fruit and bread as we asked for and that accounts for a large part of our diet (we brought our own oats for oatmeal in the morning). They also provide eggs, milk, jelly, juices and even olive oil that we used for cooking. We made fried rice one night with the eggs. The lemons that grow on the property are wonderful to put in your cold water or beer. To everybody who hates bugs - I have researched the issue plus I know from my sister's experience from 20 years in Puerto Rico that there are no \"killer\" bugs in the Caribbean. Even scorpions and tarantulas are harmless. Remember, we are a FAR greater danger to them and their environment than they are to us. They may cause skin irritations but that's about all. I always bring Lanacain or something to sooth bug bites. We should all just enjoy every last little creature 'cause who knows how long we'll all be around at the rate that we humans are destroying our shared environment. All those little creatures are part of the chain - they all serve a purpose. Why can't we ever get that into our heads? The last Caribbean vacation we took last February our cottage was full of bugs and we just reminded ourselves of that and felt very calm about it. To sum it up: we intend to go back to the Hix Island House as much as we can and we would like to try all of the units eventually.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cranston, RI", "Title": "\u201cRomantic 25th anniversary at Hix!\u201d", "Author": "RItraveller", "ReviewID": "UR6086153", "Content": "Just returned from 3 nights at HIH and we could not have had a better experience. We only wished that we could have stayed longer. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and found HIH to be a sensual, romantic experience in every way. Everything starts with the design of the rooms and grounds. Our room (Loft 1) was designed so that the natural world was always present. Whether it was the sun reflecting off the brushed concrete wall in the morning or the fabulous night sky viewed from our outdoor shower, we were never far from nature. The rooms are designed to take advantage of prevailing breezes to cool the room so that there is no need for air-conditioning. This allows you to hear the coqui at night, the birds in the morning or the breeze rustling through the leaves in the tree outside the bedroom window. Yes there are occasional insects, but we used the candle powered lanterns and mosquito netting at night and had absolutely no problems. The amenities in the room were perfect. The kitchen was well equipped and we could have easily entertained several guests. We made breakfast in our kitchen each morning which saved time and money. The homemade brown nut bread was delicious toasted on the griddle. The bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows and the swinging bed on the deck was a nice touch. The grounds are beautiful, but not in a manicured formal garden sort of way. There are at least two trees with small lemons which can be used in drinks, etc. The pool uses a filtration system that minimizes the use of chemicals. The water is clean, warm and relaxing as you float under the palms. We arrived after 5PM on a Friday and there was no one else around so we had the pool to ourselves. It was a great way to unwind after a long day of traveling. Swimming at night under a sky with a million stars was magical. The staff (Michael, Diane, Brenda and Joanne) was friendly and helpful. They provided recommendations answered questions (the biobay trip is an incredible experience which should not be missed) and but did not intrude on our solitude. The masseuse they recommended (Lee) was excellent. Honor system beers and cold drinks at the front desk were a nice convenience. Despite our enthusiasm, I agree with other reviews in that HIH isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for everyone. You are exposed to nature in ways that just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist at most other hotels.

My wife and I were at our mental limits and had to get away, but I demanded some place \"different\" because I travel frequently for my job so I've grown numb to 5-star hotels/resorts, which all look & feel the same to me. I just wanted peace & quiet, away from people being paid to be nice to me. My wife, on the other hand, freely admits she likes to be pampered on vacations; but she \"compromised\" for this trip because I was particularly burnt out. Surprisingly, she was absolutely blown away by Hix. Not surprisingly, so was I. Recalling the trip afterwards, we agreed that one of the most memorable moments (along with BioBay, the great food downtown, having the Vieques beaches all to ourselves) was our initial shock opening the door to our room. It was huge, and beautiful in its minimalism. There was one reviewer who used the word \"sterile\" - wrong. \"Minimalist\" is a genuine compliment, as the Hix perfectly melds with the overall experience of Vieques. This is an island with only 10k people owning just 40% of the land; the electricity still occasionally goes out - for the whole island. Hix lets you quietly melt into the background and fully experience the tranquility of Vieques. Our view was gorgeous. An obligatory photo of the outdoor shower. Our room was huge. The bread & fruit was tasty, and the fridge a great option. And the outdoor yoga was by far the best yoga I've ever had; fresh air, rising sun, day heating up (good for flexibility). I highly recommend going to the Green Store for lunch picnics and grabbing the occasional breakfast or dinner materials. We went to another store and found worms in our pancake mix. We also swatted some small gnats at night when we played Scrabble (they have several board games downstairs). These things do not ruin a trip; they're part of the experience of an island that miraculously remains one of the best kept travel secrets. The best part of the trip was the lack of TV, computer, or any other electronic/media distraction. We tore thru books, we had a blast & a few fights playing Scrabble, and we had the unusual experience of just being with each other with no distractions. If that sounds boring, don't go to Vieques or Hix. If you want to go to an island for a fake getaway with self-important people dressed in $100 'casual' shorts - go to Nantucket.

My wife (we just got married down in Vieques, and had our reception at the Casona) and I can't pay enough compliments to the managers, Diane and Michael, and our personal \"answer girl,\" Brenda. We've never felt choked up about checking out of a hotel, but this time, it was like saying goodbye to old friends . . . these three were our family in Vieques, and we're really going to miss them. Brenda, always cheerful, always helpful, will get you sorted on what to do and where to go when you're on this beautifully sleepy little island. In the weeks leading up to our trip, she was my point of contact for making sure everything was in order. On top of that, she helped serve food at our reception (more on that later), and our guests paid compliment after compliment on how much they loved Brenda. Michael saved our reception from dissolving into an evening of sit and stare. Unfortunately, a few of our 'party' guests dropped out at the last second, and we were left with an unhealthy mix of old and young that was hesitant to sit back and enjoy themselves. Mike played DJ for a bit and had the salsa going, and although people still refused to dance (my feet hurt/I'm tired/etc), Mike and Diane were dancing, and eventually a limbo stick popped out, and I ended up in the pool in my wedding pants. More people followed (some forcibly) and the mood loosened after that. ---- On a side note, while I didn't get a chance to try any, Mike won a hot sauce competition this past weekend, so be sure to ask him for a taste . . . I've gotta ask him to send us a bottle . . . As for Diane . . . working with Brenda, she made the entire trip as seamless as possible; she made sure we had chicken for the dinner the night before the wedding, she got the flowers to us in time for the ceremony, she softened the blows of 'wedding planning disasters' I encountered -- we could not have pulled off this wedding without her. It's rather rare to meet someone who's a genuinely kind person -- who's not just smiling because she has to. We feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet her and this Hix family. The hotel itself is astounding. We were lucky enough to rent out the whole hotel for our wedding guests, so we got to experience each of the lofts. Thunderstorms in your room, coqui (tree frogs native to PR) on your kitchen counter, lizards on your patio furniture, outdoor showers -- all very, very cool. The view from the 'skydeck' of Matisse, I believe (top of Casa Triangular), is beyond words. I'd never seen the Milky Way outside of pictures and the occasional trip to the Adler Planetarium here in Chicago -- on a clear night, the stars are right there with you. If you're worried about mosquitos, yes, you'll get a few bites, but so did couples that were staying in typical Inns and resorts on the island. Honestly, we got more mosquito bites eating at Island Steakhouse (awesome food!) than we did from eating in our loft. Put on some spray and you'll be fine. We had a bit of . . . uh . . . 'naked time,' and the bugs respected our privacy. I'd recommend staying in one of the upper lofts; we stayed in Loft 1 and loved it, but again, we were able to check out the other lofts as well since our guests were basically in every room. The upper lofts were nicer than the lower lofts if only because they had better views. For the love of God, though, if you're squeamish about bugs or lizards or creatures that go 'coqui' in the night, stay at Martineau Bay or something. The reviews that have been posted thus far are accurate, for the most part (admittedly, I was a little nervous about reading nothing but glowing reviews, and paid more attention to the negative than the positive comments). The person complaining about not getting bread -- there's a food request sheet at the front desk, we got everything we wanted every time we requested it. Write what you want down before 1:00 or something, and you'll get it, simple as that. We had zero problems in that regard.

Don't get me wrong, it is architecturally striking, environmentally friendly and a retreat from technology and the mundane routine. But it's not for everyone (and i'm not exactly a \"princess\" type). It just didn't live up to it's expectations once I arrived...and we didn't get daily fresh baked bread...we got one for the week. The owners were nice...enough...but not overly so (we met them once). I guess we'd heard all the hype about how wonderful Hix was and were a little disappointed it didn't live up to it. Something about being surrounded by concrete was rather disconcerting, almost sterile. The view was okay, we thought we would have a view of the ocean from our room. The furniture is actually very patio furniture like (in fairness the accessories were unique and wonderful), they have to be durable because yes, it will rain in your living room (and it makes the concrete slippery). We arrived in the beginning of rainy season and the bugs were bad - very bad. But my husband never got bitten. Our mosquito net told a story in the morning...I was afraid to do yoga - something about the combo of deet, sweat and bugs - which I had really been looking forward to as part of our trip.

Bugs aside...If you're traveling to Hix, here are my suggestions: Bring books for the daytime, maybe even your computer (I know, I know...) for the DVD player with some movies for the evening. Split up your time (if you have it) to really experience the different flavors of the island - the areas are very different (Isabella, Bravo Beach, Esperanza) and Hix is somewhat isolated in more of a hilltop area. Good for privacy and solitude, not if you want to be closer to the action (restaurants, beaches, etc...especially at night). There are many beautiful places to stay on the island. Check out as many restaurants as you can! Of course I don't want to make it seem horrible.

If you are turned off, as I am, by the crowded, souvenir-shop infested, overpriced, commercial tourist traps that so much of the Caribbean has become, then you will love the unspoiled, natural beauty of this island and the elegant simplicity of this hotel. It takes about a day to fully appreciate the genius of the inn's architecture; when I first walked into my room I didn't quite get the huge open-air window cutouts and the polished concrete that makes up the countertops, floors, and walls of the buildings. However, the rooms are designed so that the gentle breeze is constant, eliminating the need for air conditioning, and it seemed almost miraculous that concrete could feel so comfortable and rooms so completely open to the outdoors could be so private (because of the way the buildings are situated on the slope.) And nothing feels better than taking an open-air (but totally private) shower. We stayed in a room called the Studio, and it had a nice kitchen stocked with fresh bread, coffee, juice, milk, and everything we needed, so we didn't need to leave our room until we were ready to go exploring. I spent long mornings reading on our terrace, listening to the birds singing and the wild horses neighing. The beaches were postcard beautiful and nearly deserted, even the public beach with its restrooms and concession (which served surprisingly good food). If you like driving around, there are many dirt roads leading to remote coastal areas. We also had lunch and dinner in the two tiny towns, Isabel Segundo and Esperanza, and the food was excellent wherever we went. The highlight of the weekend was the nighttime kayaking trip to Mosquito Bay (there were no mosquitos at all), which is said to be the greatest example of \"bioluminescence\" (millions of tiny organisms that light up when disturbed, or splashed) in the world. It absolutely has to be experienced to be believed. Just kicking in the water makes it light up like a fountain. Though the setting at Hix Island House is very private, the entire staff is very approachable and works hard to make guests feel comfortable.

I'm refering to unwinding and relaxing to recharge you batteries. I got to this state in about half a day at Hix Island house, a record on any vacation. Innkeepers Mike and Dianne made sure we knew where to go, what to do, and where to eat. Their friendly, relaxed attitude will get you the full lowdown on the island and all it has to offer. The thing is.... it's OK if you don't step a foot out of Hix, enjoy the pool, take a walk, lounge out in the tropical setting and feel the gentle breeze of the Carribean. But what about the BUGS!? It's the tropics and you've got a non-airconditioned room open to the \"elements\". We'll the breeze took care of the air-conditioning part. It was incredibly rejuvenating not to be in a hotel with the air-conditioning pumping away all night. The bugs were \"on vacation\". I don't know if it's the breeze, or the dry season but they didn't pose a problem. I came fully prepared to douse myself with chemicals but in the end the cans of spray stayed on the shelf. Ok so where's the bad part? I hate reading reviews where people just keep gushing on and on, you know there must be something they're not telling you. We'll first if you rent a vehicle, make sure it's a high clearance \"Jeep like\" car. A quick shower can turn the roads into large puddles (if you asked Mike and Dianne they would have told you about this). It's fun if you have a Jeep but not so great if you get stuck in you Neon. Next even if you have a Jeep it's not a great idea to go exploring on a path in the jungle that no one has been down in the last 10 years. It might just... end and then you've got an interesting multi-point turn (speaking from experience). Also the scratches on the vehicle might be a problem when you return it to the rent-a-car place (errr... what scratches?) Last, Mike and Dianne will tell you about all the nice restaurants on the island. It's surprising how many there are. You should go visit every one of them if you get into your \"zone\" running or exercising.

But of course the beaches were the best way to spend the day. We went to all the beaches on the way out to Blue beach and enjoyed the all for different reasons. Some were wavy and good for body surfing. Others were easy to swim and fun to snorkle. The one regret we had was that we didn't go to Green Beach with snorkling equiptment. We waited until the last day to go there and found it to be the best beach for potential cool fish sightings. Lots of nice boats to look at from mainland PR. Some people told us not to tell anyone about beautiful Vieques, but we are spreading the word. I am sure the local people and businesses would appreciate the tourists.

When we walked in the unit, there was fresh baked bread and a refrigerator full of eggs, milk, juice, cereal, butter and COFFEE!!! This place has it all! After we finished checking out all the features of this wonderful room, I took the wife to see the BioBay. The BioBay alone is enough reason to visit Vieques and stay at the Hix Island House. Kurt gave me excellent directions to the place. When we got back, it rained, which was absolutely beautiful and wonderful, considering there are no windows or doors in the unit.

The large amount of roosters on the island can be annoying (they don't just crow at dawn). The service was helpful, setting up tours and restaurant reservations. The island is definitely for outdoorsy people who don't just want to shop and plop and as you must drive, you'll have to be used to narrow winding, sometimes rough roads.

And the bio-bay is just mind-blowing. Take the Kayak tour with Abe. He's great. As far as restaurants go: La Sirena is a joke of bad management and despite the good tamales it's only worth getting a beer or watching the theatre of the owner fighting with her help. Bili is quite good but a little pricey for what it is. The Tiki Hut sandwich shop is good for breakfast but the sandwiches are a bit strange (the owner was very nice and let us get food just before he closed).

If you do not enjoy being outside, need air conditioning or hate bugs, you will most likely not be comfortable there. We went in the off season, so it was very wet - nothing ever dried out completely. We stayed at HIH for 3 nights, which was enough - although we're very glad to have experienced it and will do so again in the future. The grounds and architecture are minimally invasive (very hidden) and fabulous. It's not manicured landscaping like you would find over at the Wyndam, but what would be there naturally. Beautiful. The pool area is stunning, and the water feels very clean (low chemical pool). Although we stayed on the top floor of Casa Rectangular during a booked memorial day weekend (according to innkeepers) we rarely saw or heard another person. The open floorplan gave views of the coast over the tree tops, and the nights were amazingly starry and peaceful. That same open floorplan lets the sun come glaring in EARLY (5:30 - 6 am) - so if you like to sleep late on vacation it's going to be difficult. There is no maid service, but whenever you request something it's there. The coffee is good, the bread somewhat tasty but a little mushy (maybe its the rainy season again). Nothing on Vieques is local (ie: fruit), so expect your basic apple and orange combo flown in from mainland PR. As for the luxury linens/furniture - we had a couple of Frette towels and I think the bedspread was from Ikea. We could care less what kind of linens are provided (again this was not luxury), or furniture - but if it's advertised as such then people expect it to be so. Also we had one very uncomfortable lounge chair made from plywood and a broken plastic armchair - so to sit together we had to perch on the balcony. The innkeepers (Kurt and Christianne) are helpful and very interesting to talk with. Being from over-developed Florida we appreciate what John Hix has created - an attempt to be minimally invasive and environmentally conscious. Overall we would stay at HIH again not expecting luxury, but expecting a quiet, relaxing \"experience.\"", "Date": "July 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, MO", "Title": "\u201cLike camping - only better\u201d", "Author": "milytaylor", "ReviewID": "UR2029852", "Content": "First of all, if you don't like to camp, you won't like Hix Island House. The rooms are open which means: no lights after dark and no leaving food lying around. I love camping so I didn't have any problems. In fact, it's better because you didn't have to worry about the tents collapsing and you have a constant supply of hot water. :) I just got back from my trip and I miss Hix already. The frogs, called coquis (co-keys), will serenade you to sleep. The rains will lull you into peacefulness. The sun and the roosters will signal the new day. The views are breath-taking. The pool divine. I never once wished for a TV, AC, or DVD. (not included in the room) I brought my own radio/alarm clock. (No clocks in room either.) The room also doesn't have a phone but there is one phone at the main office. I went in off-season, so this may not be true all year around. The island pretty much shuts down at 9 - 10. Bars don't stay open late and there's no place to dance and congregate. Vieques is an island to get away from it all. Don't expect coffee shops, ice cream stands, or bookstores. I found two chains - Directv and the USPS. If that isn't your cup of tea and you need your TV, DVD, AM/FM, then maybe Hix isn't the place for you. Being a single female traveler, I never once felt threatened during my stay at Hix, Vieques, or San Juan.", "Date": "May 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA Unique and Relaxing Vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1685421", "Content": "Our stay at Hix Island House was one of the most relaxing vacations I have been on. I had done my homework and knew quite a bit about the resort before I arrived. However, for me, it exceeded my expectations! This is a beautiful place high in the hills. Beautiful tradewinds meant very few bugs while we were there - I only got one mosquito bite during my entire stay in Vieques. Our room was large and spacious and wonderful. It was as open as they described - we had a large patio that was completely open to the outside (there is a metal grate if that makes you more comfortable at night) A ceiling fan made our nights comfortable and we never ever noticed the lack of air conditioning. The openness of our room (missing the fourth wall as we were on the ground floor) made it completely unnecessary. At the same time we were never cold either. The kitchen contained all the utensils, plates and things we required (paper towel, etc). Neeva's potato bread is excellent and was still warm and wrapped in a linen towel when we arrived. A fruit bowl was also inviting when we checked in. We love to cook and it was wonderful to have a spacious area to prepare our own snacks and meals. Grocery shops are just a short drive away. The reception desk and hostesses were incredibly helpful with restaurant recommendations, directions, bookings, everything. A yoga class that I did while I was there was just that - a real yoga class where people from outside the place came to practice. Nightimes were incredible - beautiful star watching, especially from the lounge chairs that we had. One reviewer from last year felt the location was not convenient. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. In my opinion, a car is essential for visiting Vieques. I can't imagine anyone coming to Vieques without one. We rented a Honda Element and found we were close to everything on the island. After a week of driving around from the Hix Island House, our gas bill was $14US. I think the location is central and perfect. Part of our experience was feeling as if the place was our home. And we truly did. We enjoyed washing our own dishes and making our bed. If we needed anything, we simply asked reception and it was done. Vieques was a wonderful place for peace and quiet. Most nights we 'hung out' watching the stars or reading. We had a truly wonderful meal at Cafe Media Luna one night - the tasting menu is fantastic. Another highly regarded restaurant Chez Shack is just at the end of the street (walking distance) I will definitely be back!", "Date": "March 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cIt is like a dream....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1643547", "Content": "We have never experienced such a relaxing holiday as our few days at Hix Island House and the wonderful little island of Vieques. Vieques was a refreshing change from the other Caribbean islands we have visited, in that there was never a lineup experienced, security concerns were rarely if ever present, the beaches were incredible, and the restaurants, surprisingly for such a small place, were of exceptional quality and variety. In response to this setting, John and Neeva Gayle Hix have created the perfect complement. Imagine sleeping in a shell with an 18' wide opening to the softest breezes imaginable at your feet, and waking to the sun gently rising over the Caribbean each morning and illuminating your studio in a warm glow. The achievement of the architecture is that you have a very immediate connection to the natural environment (ocean breezes, sun and shadow, sounds of birds and coqui), yet are protected from the heat of the sun and the night-time rain showers, and can regulate it very easily by manipulating the windowless openings to the exterior. The connection between interior and exterior is often vague - living spaces that project unimpeded to the open sky, showers for each suite that are either open directly to the view or the sky or both, outdoor dining courtyards protected from the wind... The minimal, stongly geometric forms of the buildings magnify the beauty of the natural surroundings and very successfully capture the spirit of the climate. The grounds are a clever combination of wild trees and plants, with shots of colour or form presented by flowering vines and dramatic tall grasses, all orchestrated to provide privacy for the guests and a wonderful ambiance similar to ancient ruins in a jungle. One of the best discoveries is the award-winning swimming pool, with its copper-treated water and view over the hills to the ocean. The hospitality of the owners and staff were excellent, with a very well stocked refrigerator upon arrival, fresh-baked bread (which should be available for export!) and yoga lessons on site, and an eagerness to assure that guests make the most of their stay on the island by readily recommending interesting sites and good restaurants. Hix Island House is definitely a 'design destination', and in conjunction with the interests of its owners in environmental conservation, is also an experience unlike any others we know of. If you enjoy adventure and good design, we highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cA dream honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1511172", "Content": "Hix Island House was provided a spectacular finale to my honeymoon.
