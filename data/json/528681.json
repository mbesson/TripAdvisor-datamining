Located through large main door - on 2nd floor of building (press buzzer to be let in). Reception - small but nice reception area (but then it is only a small hotel). All staff very polite, friendly, lots of smiles made you feel very welcome. Rooms - average size, small bathroom but with everything you need, very nicely maintained and decorated. A little noisy at night, but then you are on a main road so this can't be helped - after a long day exploring Rome, it isn't too difficult to fall fast asleep! Breakfast - had to leave early for flight so didn't get to see breakfast, however, fresh croissants had just been delivered and the man at reception made sure to offer us some to take with us. Location - excellent - 3 mins from Colloseum/Forum/Palatine Hill e.t.c. - turn right out of hotel and come to crossroads in 30seconds - look left and the Colloseum is there - 3mins down the road and left and you come to the Colloseum.

I was pleasantly surprised!!! What\u2019s more, I stayed twice at Adas Hotel, in February and in July this year. It is a very cheap hotel so one must be aware of what to expect. I don\u2019t agree with other reviewers. Some people seem to expect five-star facilities in a budget hotel. If one likes and enjoys comfort, big spaces, modern facilities, then one must choose another kind of hotels. This is a budget hotel, useful for having a bath and sleeping after a long day in Rome. It is just that! I paid 75 \u20ac for a triple room. That is very cheap! Breakfast included! It is true that breakfast is basic (some toast, bread, croissants, jam/butter, cornflakes, milk and the BEST coffee I have ever had in my life!!!). The hotel has rooms on different floors. The ones that are on the 6th floor are the best ones. Elevator goes to 5th floor only, so if you have heavy luggage, it is an issue. It is an old building (something usual in Europe), with old facilities but its location is perfect! Two blocks away from The Colliseum, about 8 from Termini station, right beside Trajan's Market and the Fori Imperiali, a short walk from Piazza Venezia as well as a short stroll to Santa Maria Maggiore and San Pietro in Vincoli, where Michel Angelo\u2019s Moises is . It is true what some reviews claim that the hotel is not easy to find (its blue sign is very small) and the stairs \u201care very dark and unsigned so you are not really sure that you are in the right place\u201d. This is so. However, the address (Via Cavour 233) is easily found, as Via Cavour (full of restaurants and souvenirs shops) is a busy road. Wi-Fi only in the very small reception area. Friendly staff. Free maps in the reception. If you are not picky about hotels, but just looking for a bathroom, a bed and a basic breakfast in the Eternal City, ignore all the bad reviews about this hotel!!

Actually many other guests have given good ratings. Therefore, to avoid emotional discussion, I will try to describe as factual as possible. 1. Hotel management Adas Hotel, Romano Inn, Centro Romano -- peculiarly, these hotels are the same hotel. Same reception, same breakfast room, except that under which name you book through. Compare their websites. This means that, when you make a booking of either of those hotels, you should also refer to reviews for other two hotels. Adas Hotel -- 1200th, Centro Romano -- 120th. The appropriate ranking may be somewhere around 700th. 2. Room About 9 square meters. (2.25m*4m), 3 sm (1.5m*2m) of which was a en-suite facility with shower cubicle (80cm*80cm), washing basin and toilet. Smaller than the room shown on their website. Seems recently refurbished, cleaned well, whereas a 10cm hole could be seen on the wall, dust falling down. Room on the north side of the building, with 1m*80cm window. Loo cracked. May hurt your bottom. No heating facilities. Only an air conditioner. Of course, no fridge, tea facilities. 3. Towel Interesting. Perhaps it was not 100% cotton, but paper-mixed textile. Like disposable table clothes. No exchange during our stay for couple of nights. 4. Breakfast 7:30-9:30, not by 10:00. Menu was as advertised (coffee, croissant, cereal). The breakfast room was tiny. 18 people within about 10 sm (=2people in 1sm), and no confort. I had to que up to get a cup of coffee. Imagine fully-seated Mcdonalds. The personal space might be even smaller than Mcdonalds. I got pretty tired from the morning, though I had a lot to do on the day. You may have to wait to get a seat in busy time. We gave up having breakfast there from the second morning. 5. Payment Cash only. Credit card not accepted, on the contrary to the advertisement. 6. Check-out 10:30, not 11:00 (advertised time) 7. Location&no robbery Location is relatively good, close to the metro station. Our luggage was not robbed, though we left it (locked suitcase) in our room. We paid less than 100 euro per night, which was cheaper than the standard price in central Rome. It is all up to readers if this hotel is worth staying.

Some people complain that all the tv-channles were Italian, but that's just fine because we were in Italy! When in Italy i enjoy to follow Italian tv channles, not CNN.

We even wanted to book another hotel. But we were glad we did not. Although not everything was perfect we were still happy with our choice. So on to our review: The room was very clean and big enough. There's a safe (costs extra), a mini bar, Television (only italian channels, but there was also a digital receiver but we hat no idea how to use it or if it costs extra too) and air conditioning (5 euros per day). The bathroom (with shower) was also very clean but too small. You are not able to dress yourself there. The breakfast was ok. You can choose between coffee, cappuchino, latte and tea (we have no idea if you can get more than one cup). A pitcher of orange juice was also put on the table. The buns were very small , but you can also have cornflakes, biscuits, croissants, and something like croissants with chocolate in it. Additionally there's butter, cheese, ham and marmelade. The staff was very friendly, but unfortunately the hotel owner doesn't speak any english. But there are two big problems remaining. The first one is: The Hotel is situated at a busy road, so the night might not be as calm as you want to (being in a room on the road side). And the secound one is: if you have a room on the 6th floor and want to leave the hotel, you have to go downstairs to the 5th floor, then with the elevator to the 2nd floor (leave key at the receiption) and then again with the elevator to the ground floor.", "Date": "August 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than told before\u201d", "Author": "Scandinavian1", "ReviewID": "UR8355192", "Content": "We just arrived from Rome and stayed 5 nights at the Adashotel.

When we arrived for check in, we discovered that we would have to pay an additional 5 Euros per day to rent the air conditioning! I've stayed at a lot of hotels and I've never had to rent air conditioning in my life. We then discovered that our room was on the 6th floor (as are most of the rooms) and our elevator onlly went up to the 5th floor. We had to lug several heavy bags up an extra flight of stairs. The elevator was small and could not accommodate our bags and us so we had to go in shifts. When we did arrive at our room it was small and clean with a new bathroom. However, the \"double bed\" was actually two single beds pushed together. Anytime my husband or I would go towards the center of the bed, the beds would come apart. I asked for a room with a true double bed and was told the hotel does this for all their rooms so that every room can accommodate separate travelers as well as couples. The towels in the bathroom are comparable to very large dish towels. The hotel also requires that you leave your room key at the front desk every single time you leave. This is a nuisance as you have to stop on the second floor every time you leave and stop there again every time you come in. It felt a bit like we were being babysat. On our last day, we asked for a taxi to come pick us up at 3:45 AM as we had a 6:30 AM flight. By 3:55, we were getting concerned as the airport was 30 minutes away and we wanted to be there 2 hours prior to the departure. When I went back upstairs to ask the night desk attendent to call the taxi company the holel had recommended, he acted very nonchalantly and told me that I should just wait 10 more minutes even though the taxi was already running almost 15 minutes late at that point. We ended up having to flag down another taxi that was driving by. Note, the hotel had quoted us 49 Euros for their taxi service and the street taxi cost only 40 Euros.
