Stayed there for 3 nights in April 2012,I found that this hotel is rather good for budget traveller. If you don't spend your whole day at the hotel just for your whink of sleep then this hotel is your good choice. Its location is on geylang Lor1 road where you can find a number of seafood, chinesere staurants and fruit stalls near by especially for those who like \"durians\" Geylang street must be their favourite zone. To get to the hotel is very convenience, from Changi airport just take a MRT to Tanah Merah Junction then transitted by the east west line train to kallang station. It will totally take you around 30 minutes to the Kallang MRT. After arrving at Kallang station, keep walking on the left of the Kallang MRT station to Geylang Lor 1 road cross the intersection to Sim Ave and keep walikng straing on Sim Ave till you find the gas station walk pass the gas station. The Gelay Lor 6 where the hotel located on is just 2 block away from the gas station. Very easy to find it. Even though Geylang area is regarded as a red light district, I feel very safe and confortable during stayed there. Regarding the room, it is a compact room size with good aircon function. The bed sheet is clean but the pillow is too soft for me. this isn't a big issue though. The toilet is also clean there isn't a bath tub but only shower. The hotel provides toothbrushes, 2 small cup of drinking water, tea coffer maker and 2 packs of instant coffee every day. Safey box not provied in room you must contact front desk if you want I think it would be cost applied but I haven't used it. If you want to use internet ( both WIFI and the hotels PC) just buy a coupon from the front desk as well.It costs around 2 Singapor dollars for 30 minutes. It would be very good if the hotel provide free WIFI I think 2 dollars is very dear for just 30 minutes. Besides, the front desk agents are nice and handful.I ahd booked a wrong date for my departure flight, a front desk lady staff helped me contact the airline and got me a free of flight ticket printed. Overall, if I go back to Singapore next time, this hotel would be one of my choice.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Makati, Rizal, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cpromotional rates are nonrefundable booking...pls be warned!\u201d", "Author": "len521", "ReviewID": "UR127280068", "Content": "i booked early to avoid wasting time looking for nice hotels, since emerald hotel got the positive reviews and one of the best 2star hotels in geylang...so i booked early on line through agoda...they didnt say anything about the non refundable booking until i called the fragrance hotel reservation office! the agoda website said free cancelllation and if you'll read the booking conditions they didnt say about the promotional rates are non refundable...so we must pay the WHOLE 2days even if we dont use it or even if i cancel in advance!!!!

Unfortunately, our rooms (De Luxe) weren't ready yet until 3:00 PM, so the desk clerks suggested we put our luggage in a holding room and tour the city which we did. When my wife and I returned to check us in, we were pleasantly surprised by our rooms (Rm.509 & 510.) Both were small but were clean,and we had new towels and bedding. There was hot water and we even had complimentary coffee! Going to and from the hotel was not a problem as the Kallang MRT station was just a healthy walk away. At the Kallang station there were food outlets: Bread Talk,Old Chang Kee,Mr.Bean and a 7-11. Along Sims Avenue my wife and I discovered fruit stands where we had a snack of mangoes,papayas,and dragon fruit for $5SD. Breakfast was no problem because Chinese restos like the Mongkok Dimsum were nearby. Geylang Road is lined with lots of hawkers food restos so for our last dinner we had a filling meal of delicious Cereal Prawns,Chili Crab,Yang Chow rice and drinks for only $70 SD. Many Filipinos use the Fragrance Emerald hotel so it's easy to feel at home. A bonus is that we get to share tips on where to get a taxi easily or where to go.

The other side with shops walk there at night as the grass side is dark. Not to worry there is a pathway for you walk.

The hotel is clean, basic and is in a good location for a massive selection of eating places. This is located within 10 minute walking distance to the Kallang MRT. Despite being in the red-light district, I didn't feel unsafe or never got approached by any touts for women. I was happily roaming around at night browsing through the many eating places on offer on Geyland Road. My criteria for choosing a hotel is cleanliness and value for money. Singapore is a city of expensive hotels so finding something cheap that gives you decent crash pad is hard to come by. which is why this hotel was ok for me. The staff can be a bit more courteous and look a bit happier than look like grumpy people just doing their job. In Summary: What I liked: a) Location. Easy access to EW line MRT Kallang stop. short trip to the airport on the MRT and 2 stops to the city centre. b) Price c) Cleanliness d) Good Air con e) good hot water supply f) complimentary coffee, water cups and kettle in the room g) Towels changed daily and beds made, but not new bed linen (not like I change my bed linen at home daily) h) LCD TV What I disliked: a) Tiny rooms, barely any room to move around the room let alone keep any luggage, but not a big issue for me as I travelled with my backpack and by myself, so the spare bed was my store area. b) Bathrooms don't have shower enclosures or curtains. When you shower the whole bathroom gets wet. Not a biggie if you shower after you go to the toilet. THe water drains quickly and is dry when you go out for the day and return to the room later in the day c) no free internet , 2 hours for S$5+ . Not acceptable for a technology savvy country like Singapore where internet is now almost a basic necessity. d) Very noisy passages. Every move in the communal area including the doors being shut can be heard inside the room. e) the bed sheets were clean but I don't think the blankets were necessarily very clean The pros above were good for me and the cons were not an issue to me as my soul intention was to have a crash pad for the nights I was in SIngapore where I spent most the day out venturing around Singapore and for me to return to the hotel, shower and sleep in a clean room. therefore depending on your expectations from a hotel, this hotel can be your cup of tea and may not be your choice. After all you get what you pay for and is decent at that too. I think my view is pretty balanced and honest as I don't expect Marina Bay Sands hotel standard from a \u00a330 a night Fragrance emerald hotel.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cGood price, clean, but far from centre\u201d", "Author": "Hikari_PL", "ReviewID": "UR120779306", "Content": "Pros: clean, brand new inside, fair price.

The Geylang area has a myriad of eateries(some of which are open 24/7..) in the immediate area as well as a 7 Eleven store around the corner.The favoured mode of transport for our group was taxis.Cheap and extemely efficient,we found it to be a quicker ( and cooler choice) of transport,though there is an MRT station not far from the hotel.

I booked a room for three nights via the internet site Wotif. Months ahead i kept an eye on different sites that offers hotels in singapore. Looking for some favorable deal or promotion. But Singapore is not Bangkok where you can find four or five star hotel at a cheap price. I found some interesting offers of new hotels but somehow it was at a rather far corner of the island or far from a MRT station. I considered some private places. Guys offering a guestroom and the idea of having personal contact instead of an anynomous hotelroom seemed appealing but again it didn't work out. So i ended up again with the choice i made the previous times before. A budget hotel in the geylang area that is situated between the airport and the center, easy accessible by the MRT. I came to appreciate the area. Described as a red light district or a 'low-end' place. It is but it is surely more than that. When it comes to cleaniness and organization it can be compared to the same level as some of the better areas of any European city. Restaurants and cheap eateries everywhere. Most hotels offer one hour stay and is the terrain of a lot of female sexworkers but nowhere this turns the streets in a seedy and unsafe place like in the West. No posh shopping malls here but a vibrant streetlife at night. I read that new immigrants of mostly mainland China start their new life here and it gives the area for sure a more chinese instead of a western feeling you find in so many other places. And it keeps the prices down. And makes it an affordable place for a 'price conscious' traveller as i am. I don't know about the origins of the Fragrance hotel chain. They have several branches in this area but also in other ares of Singapore. It is a kind of 'no frills' place: small clean rooms with everything you need as a temporal visitor. Everything works what is needed: hot water, air conditioning, television, large bed. Two Stars. No breakfast or restaurant facilities. Minimal staff. Chinese impersonal service. Overpriced internet facilities but you find cheap alternatives around the corner. Don't expect something stylish, this is not Ibis. I booked a superior double room. The description of the room sounds: a small but decent size room with an ensuite bathroom. Indeed, before i must have book another type of room - i think 'deluxe'; it was a rather indecent sized room, i could hardly move around the bed and i found nearly no space to open my suitcase\u2026 This time i was housed with a room looking out on the streetfront and at the third level. The queen size bed is meant for two adults. For a single traveler as myself the room and the bed were in that case more than satisfying and that for a 'decent' price as well; for two person it would have been a bargain. For the first time i tried out the wireless service. The reception lady showed me the rates and explained something in Singlish. 10 singapore dollars for 10 hours of access seemed a good deal. When i logged on, the connection was there right away. It was only the next morning that i discovered some less pleasant side of this purchase and it was printed in a clear message on the sales ticket: 'Once activated, the time starts to run even though you may have logged out.' I guess i only used around two hours.. Not very practical if you wanna use the internet only for checking your mail or look for some information. So better go back around the corner to one of the internet caf\u00e9s where they charge only 1,5 dollar for one hour\u2026", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201cCompact Rooms for a Compact Price\u201d", "Author": "Xavier_uk", "ReviewID": "UR60469042", "Content": "I needed to stay in Singapore for a couple of nights and the Singapore Stopover was a bit too expensive after the first night.

It is a 10 minute walk to the MRT station although this does involve crossing several roads. There are many dining options at the end of the road. The check in was easy and the entrance was clean. My room looked onto the back of the hotel and was quiet at night, so I was happy. My room was compact!! I could only open my suitcase fully in two location, on the double bed and in the hallway to the bathroom/wet room. The bathroom was a wet room. This means that the shower (you need to put the heater on for hot water) was at one corner and the water drained in the centre of the bathroom. The bed was comfortable which was nice surprise. The aircondtioning worked although it had seen better days. Yes the rooms have thin walls but most of the noise comes from the corridor which I found more annoying. The room is cleaned each day as is the corridors. Another nice surprise was that 2 free bottles of water were supplied each day. Would I come back again to this hotel, yes but only after the first night of the Singapore Stopover. Odd things about the hotel When I was checking in I realised that the hotel offered \"Transit Rates\" for 1-6 hours.

The red-light-district status was not a deterrent, as it really isn't that visible unless you're aware or looking for it. Yes, they rent the rooms out hourly, but so does nearly every Geylang hotel. Why folks pay upwards of 200USD or rooms downtown in beyond me. A typical evening downtown costs a fortune.

It was priceless to see the confused look on the faces of a Korean couple, for example, as the taxi dropped them off in the parking lot. Geylang isn't on any of the numerous official \"tourist maps\" of Singapore. I had been there before, and had done my homework on TA, choosing the Fragrance Emerald from 5 or 6 identically priced choices that were all among the few really budget options offered via Expedia for an increasingly pricey Singapore. For me it worked out well. A taxi from the airport on day non-peak rate was around S$16 and got there pretty quickly. It was around noon and they didn't have rooms ready yet for my category, so I opted to store the bags and go around town for 2 or 3 hours rather than paying an upcharge for a higher grade (mine was a queen room). The room was smallish, but clean, well-kept and with most things working. \"Small\" in Singapore is still about twice the size of \"small\" in Hong Kong, and this place was larger and much better and nicer than the backpacker places I remember from Bencoolen (now gone to make way for hotels). As for location, it's about a 10-15 minute walk to Kallang MRT, which is the closest from that side of Geylang. If you stay closer to Lorong 20 and up you're nearer to Aljunied MRT and it's likely a shorter walk. Geylang is well-supplied with hawker places for food or with convenience stores, though international franchises like McDonald's would require a taxi, bus or MRT ride out of the area. As for the red-light status, the area looks like any other in Singapore by day, and by night Lorong 6 was pretty quiet. Lor 10 & 12 had what girls there were walking around (mostly Indonesian), and Lor 18 and 20 have the Thai \"fishbowl\" places. The situation could change, but Lorong 6 was a good bet for being lower-key and away from the diminished amount of activity in other blocks. Geylang has an amazing number of hotel rooms for an area of several blocks not even on tourist maps, but it appears that overbuilding + a crackdown on streetwalkers (i.e. enforcing immigration policy) has led to hotels having to attract longer stayers. My room was on the fourth floor and away from whatever short-term traffic they had over the course of 2 weekdays...in most places the lower floors are kept for the hourly customers and the higher floors for the longer-stayers, though there could be some mixing of room assignments on a busy weekend, I'd imagine. Overall I'd conditionally recommend for seasoned budget travelers and most everyone except families with children.", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAs expected for the price\u201d", "Author": "nz_traveller_1234", "ReviewID": "UR36689010", "Content": "Bit of a mixed bag, was going to book into another hotel @ $NZ130 per night but then thought I'd try Fragrance Emerald as it was only $NZ50 per night.

But another viable option is The Fragrance Emerald Hotel, especially for those willing to 'walk on the wild side'.

I had to open my luggage on the bed and side step around the whole room. The floors were extremely dirty and the room had this certain scent. It was disgusting to keep waking up to that scent through the night. I had to sleep with the bed sheet over my face since the scent was overpowering. The sink also smelled terrible. It was definately coming from the drain. When I took a shower, everything in the bathroom was drenched since there is nothing partitioning any part of the bathroom. Just imagine a square - top left: shower, bottom left: toilet, top right:sink, bottom right:door, center, drain. This bathroom was probably no bigger than 5' x 4' (please keep in mind that I'm being extremely generous with this size). If you don't believe me... check out my pictures!! When we came back into our room that night, the power in the room was off. We called the maid who was cleaning a couple of doors down. She came in with folded up jeans, tshirt and no shoes. The most disgusting thing in this room would have to be the little chair for the mirror. You couldn't even sit on the chair because of the diseases it may have contained. There countless dripstains all over the chair. Worst of all, the minute you step outside of the hotel, there are six or seven prostitutes standing five inches apart. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, but when I came back about nine hours later, they were still there. Some were being dropped off by other men. You make the call. Thank god, we only stayed for one night. We did have this reserved about a week later for two nights, but I'm sure it was worth the $25 to change the reservation. Bottom line, if you are broke and want to stay in a roach motel to see beautiful Singapore, please stay here. Otherwise, Singapore hotels may just be a spare no expense issue to ensure a decent stay. I suggest the M hotel! This should be their ad: If you want to take a shower, do some business in the toilet, brush your teeth and watch T.V at the same time, this is the place for you!!!
