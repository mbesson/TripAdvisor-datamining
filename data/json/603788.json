Because I speak Spanish I found it easier to get around in Barcelona and the hotel but for my boyfriend he found it a bit difficult to converse with the people there. The staff otherwise are very helpful and relaxed. There is also a luggage storage room if you have an early checkout but a late flight which we found very useful Hotel Breakfast- the hotel breakfast was excellent! We thought it would be a continental breakfast of the usual boring ham, cheese and toast but here there was a selection of chorizo, jamon, tortilla espanola (vegetarian), croissants, baguette, buns, sausages, fruit, tomatos, coffee, juice, sausages, boiled eggs and some little cakes. The eating area is located in the basement of the hotel and is really, really nice Location- The hotel is located in the Medinaceli Square which is seen on most Barcelona city maps and is very easy to find (at least for me because I google mapped it before). It is located not even 5 minutes from Las Ramblas, about a 10 minute walk to Port Vell and 25 minute walk to Barceloneta (I'm sure the walks would be shorter for us if it wasn't so hot and we weren't trudging along!). During our stay my boyfriend and I walked around and visited the sites and were very thankful for the central location of our hotel. We flew into Spain from Girona aiport and there was a bus that took us to the bus station in Barcelona (about 20 minute walk from the hotel). A return ticket to the airport was 22euros and valid for a month. Food- Barcelona isn't a cheap city and the average cost of a meal if about 10euros and this isn't usually from the nicest restaurant. We bought some jamon, baguette, olives and chorizo from a local supermercado and ate that on the 'balcony' of the hotel room which was a lot cheaper than eating out that day! The food is very nice in Barcelona but the restaurants are very repetitive. Avoid eating at or around Las Ramblas as the restaurants are expensive. Overall a great hotel and brilliant trip! Barcelona has a great day and night life and the culture there is very relaxed and chilled.

Taxis were ordered and we then spent some time driving round Barcelona trying to get to the hotel as there was a demonstration in progress which blocked a number of streets and we finished up walking quite a way with our cases. The hotel was formerly a palace and there are signs of this particularly in the central atrium.There is a strange smell on entering the hotel but once inside this disappears. The reception staff were O.K but not particularly welcoming or over friendly. Our bedroom was fine overlooking a small street at the side of the hotel, a reasonable size, clean and light with a decent shower ( which we had requested). The hotel is in a small square just across the road from the marina and on the edge of the gothic quarter so very convenient for everything. Unfortunately the building on the side of the square next to the hotel is virtually derelict and appears to house undesirables at night. In the square itself people congregate to drink, talk and shout until the late into the night. This was not a problem for us in January but could be in warmer weather with the windows open! The breakfast room is in the basement, pleasant enough but uninspiring. Breakfast was virtually the same each day and not particularly exciting but there was enough to eat. The coffeee machine was not a good one and the drinks it produced we found to be of poor quality.

We think it unrealstic to expect an hotel to be completely quiet in the centre of this most vibrant city! The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable. Our only small diasappointment was that there could have been a little more choice at breakfast (there was no muesli or wholemeal bread and the fruit salad was from a can - there was whole fresh fruit, however) and it would be much better to have properly made coffee rather than a do-it-yourself machine. In short, we would have given this hotal five stars but it lost one for the breakfast. Finally, we don't think it is worth paying the full price for this hotel.

Think the key to the good/bad reviews may be which floor your room is. Did hear a few people complaining about noise who were all on the top floor. I stayed in a room on first floor overlooking the square with 2 balconies and had no noise problems and also stayed in room on second floor (also with 2 balconies) over the side street and again had no noise problems. Always found the front desk staff helpful and able to speak English. Breakfast was good but was included in my price (booked hotel online). Heard it was 9 euros otherwise which is a bit steep unless you are a big breakfast eater. Rooms were clean and location is 5 minutes from beach, shopping centre, Las Ramblas and a metro station... ie GREAT ! Minor points but... no shampoo, conditioner, lotion, radio or alarm clock. Also no internet, business centre, gym, restaurant or bar on site. Charged 3 euro per day if want to use the room safe. If request the mini bar key can have use of the small fridge in each room. Overall - think the key is how much you are paying for the rooms. It is a good hotel, good staff, good breakfast, and excellent location - probably in reality more what you would expect from a 3 star hotel though.... As far as pointers - do take the airport bus (vice train or taxi). It costs 4.05 euros and brings you to Catalanya place. From there either take the metro to Dassanes and walk 5 minutes or take a taxi (about 5 euros). I made the mistake of sleeping in a bit and deciding to take a taxi to the airport and it cost me 20 euros + 12 in surcharges (32 euro total) due to 1) leaving before 0800 which is a higher tarrif rate, 2) having luggage - of which he counted my handluggage/small backpack as a full piece of luggage on top of that because I put it in the trunk instead of bringing with me up front 3) extra charge to go to the airport 4) extra charge for the hotel calling for him (vice being flagged down) and 5) best of all when I asked to confirm I had the right airport terminal my flight would be out of ... he called in to his central dispatch to confirm and then told me that \"call\" would be an additional 2 euro surcharge.... as I said... take the airport bus.......", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hastings, East Sussex", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, bad smells! and definately not a 4 star\u201d", "Author": "killakellers", "ReviewID": "UR21311623", "Content": "We arrived in Barcelona late, and were told that our hotel had been double booked.

On the plus size, the room was clean, modern and a reasonable size. The bathroom also had a good quality power shower and was clean and well equiped.

The front desk staff was helpful and our room was larger than we expected upon arrival, considering the typical European hotel room. We found the room to be comfortable, and there was no outside noise at all to bother us which was perfect! We didn't need use of the room safe as we were only staying one night and the bed, linens and bathroom amenities were very good and perfect for our needs. Our only complaint is that in our room the air conditioning did not seem to function. Because we traveled to Barcelona during mild weather this was not an issue for us, but other US guests may complain about this since we are spoiled with our expectations for the typical hotel. We disagree with other guest's impressions of the breakfast - we were pleasantly surprised to see a nicely decorated , brightly lit and large breakfast room with elegant chairs and table linens and the hot buffet selection was delicious, plentiful and replenished regularly. There were also a variety of meats [chorizos or sausages], pastries/cakes, yogurt, cereals, fresh fruit and an easy to use coffee machine that dispensed a choice of hot beverages with and without milk and caffeine. If you chose hot cocoa or tea this was also available. It exceeded our expectations and we definitely recommend it to any guests who don't want to pay excessive euros looking for a meal early in the morning because of a misleading review. Also, the location to the Ramblas was ideal, just a few short blocks and we were in heaven. We arrived during Mother's Day in Barcelona and the Ramblas were full of life and entertainment. We enjoyed an amazing meal and delicious Tapas at a restaurant on the Ramblas only a short walk away - Amaya. I strongly recommend it. We noticed several of the other patrons eating there were repeat visitors, as the wait staff remembered them and took extra good care of them. This is what you want from a vacation! The prices were right in line with similar restaurants located on the Ramblas - you can compare menus as you walk by and see for yourself. Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again. It is charming, beautifully decorated inside, and there is a Tabacco store not two minutes away from the entrance where you can buy stamps for the post cards you'll be sending to your family telling them how amazing Barcelona is. The Front desk reception will kindly mail the post card for you - now that's service. Also, since we had a sightseeing tour booked for early morning the day our cruise departed, the front desk has a special room to hold luggage at no extra charge, and they will monitor it for you. You can get to it whenever you need it and they can arrange taxis or recommend tours for you if you are spending extra time in Barcelona. The hotel was also within a short walking distance of the Plaza de Colom [or Christopher Columbus Plaza for those of us from the states] and it seemed the Touristy thing to do was to take pictures on the lion statues and buy tickets on the Hop On/Hop Off city bus. The pier area has a great little mall [Maremagnum] and the Aquarium is nearby for anyone who is interested.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Medinaceli", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d603788-Reviews-Medinaceli-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$122 - $241*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Plaza duc de Medinaceli 8</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "603788", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fe/8d/fe8d8f25506d6895d5815a2aab540ffc6large.jpg"}}
