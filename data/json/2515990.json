What attracted us back was the good experience last year plus the great location of the hotel in the midst of the city. This time though, we decided to opt for the newer modernized wing. To our delightful surprise, the hotel could guarantee interconnecting rooms which was perfect for our needs - a family of four with two teenagers. The hotel had not changed much and we recognized some of the staff from last year's visit - a good sign. The bell boy came to our rescue immediately as the taxi drew up and front desk staff were friendly and courteous. The hotel lobby was still as busy and was humming with guests. Our rooms were on the 4th floor and had a view of the pool courtyard. Both were spacious and inviting - one with a king bed and the other with two queens - and very different to the older style rooms in the historical wing we stayed in previously. We loved the storage space provided and the comfortable beds. Internet access was complimentary as part of the room tariff. There was no mini bar but the hotel provided bottled water and coffee making facilities in the rooms. There is a restaurant on site which provides in-room dining which we had on one night. The menu was extensive and our order, although reasonably large, arrived within 30 minutes. The price of the appetizers and salads were between USD$7 - 15 and mains ranged from $USD20 - 35. Quality was variable; a word of warning that we found some of the meals way too large for one person even with a big appetite so it may pay to ask for some guidance. The salad starters were nice and fresh. Worth considering is the Endive and Pecan Nut Salad with Blue Cheese dressing. The mains that deserve a mention are the chicken pot pie which was a hit with our daughter but was large enough for 2-3 servings, and the Pork Chops with Blueberry Sauce. The latter came with a large dollop of mashed potatoes and a good portion of spinach. The NY pepper steak could have been good but the portion my husband had was too sinewy for the price of the dish. The chocolate layer cake dessert offering was fantastic but again a 2-3 person serving size. Step out of The Handlery and you will find yourself in the midst of things. The hotel is surrounded by a large range of restaurants and cafes so guests are actually spoilt for choice if they are eating out. A short walk down Maiden Lane is Bistro 69, an unpretentious Italian joint serving well priced good fare. The coffee is superb! The hotel is also great for the shoppers amongst us being a short step away from high end designer and main street shops. Macy's is up one block from the O'Farrell entrance. Art galleries are also aplenty and are great for a browse. Those interested in catching the historic San Francisco trams will find a stop at Powell St. This line services the trams that head towards Fisherman's Wharf and is fequented by tourists. If looking for a joy ride, go early as the queues can get horribly long. After two more nights at The Handlery this year, it still has the thumbs up from the family. We would certainly return again especially to the rooms in the new wing. Unless a bedroom by the poolside was definitely wanted, avoid the 2nd floor rooms as there is little privacy.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cA centrally located, friendly, well appointed and great value hotel\u201d", "Author": "Gail P", "ReviewID": "UR128256813", "Content": "Centrally located,friendly, well appointed hotel.

I'll start with the postive bits. We ( 2 adults 2 children 13 and 15) were travelling with my brother and father in law. The check in was very smooth and we were given 3 rooms next to each other which was great. When we arrived in our room we noticed that the 2 beds in the our room were fairly narrow, much closer to a large single than a double, we decided that we couldnt spend 4 nights sleeping virtually on top of each other and rang reception to ask if anything could be done. the recptionist said they were very sorry and that porter would be up very shortly to move us to another room. A few minutes later the porter arrived and moved us to another room (actually a suite of 2 rooms ) this room was great and very spacious, but it had the same sized beds as the last room. I pointed this out and after a further conversation with the receptionist we were moved to a suite which had a king sized bed and a large pull out sofa. the room was clean and very nicely furinshed with flat screen TVs in both rooms. The room overlooked the main street and whilst this meant you heard traffic noise, I dont mind this as I quite like the noise of a city. We recevied vouchers for a free breaksfast every morning and this was so good that we used them every day. you can choose between a very nice fry up (American breakfast) or Muesli (Granola) or a belgian waffle, accompanied with penty of sour dough toast (delicious!). The bar was also very nice with a broad choice of quality spirits and a decent range of bottled beers. We looked at both the pool areas and the gym, but didnt use either. They were both very pleasant and well maintained. To sum up an excellent hotel right in the heart of the city, with first class amenities. This is the incident that spolit my stay. On our second to last day we were woken at 7 am by a protest taking place at a hotel about 150 yards up the road. There were approx 7 people with placards and loud hailers protesting about being harshly treated by that hotel (they were either current or former employees). This protest went on for an hour and we were then able to return to sleep. The following morning, our last day at the hotel, exactly the same thing happened. given that we were travelling that day I knew I wouldnt have time to return to sleep so rang reception to complain about the second early wake up and ask couldnt something be done. I was then informed that the protestors had a PERMIT to hold this protest EVERY morning, I asked why we hadnt been told this and was told this was an oversight. I then went over to have a word with the protestors, one my way back in I was asked by reception how I was that day, given that I was by now hopping mad, I told them, this resulted in the manager coming down to speak with me, he was very apologetic. I pointed out to him again that he should have told us this was going to happen regularly so we could have requested a quieter room. At this point the lady who had checked us in said she had told us all upon check in that the protests would be taking place. This was a lie! She hadnt, or at least if she had it had been done in such a way that none of the 7 people in our party had absorbed the fact, which seems extremely unlikely. I guess, if you feel that way inclined, its ok to lie to your boss about imparting information to customers when they arent there. But to do so in front of the customer concerned is terrible, I was outraged. The whole situation could have been avoided by them telling us that the protests were scheduled, the hotel failed to do this simple thing and then tried to tell me that they had.

For maybe $10-$20 more per night there are much better hotels available in SF, including the Financial District. So unless this location is paramount, I would not recommend it. And, in comparing prices, be aware that there is a surcharge of $10.99/ night on the standard-size room rate for wi-fi, and that charge is device-specific -- that is, if 2 people want to each use their own laptop (even at different times) that's $22/ night more.

You thought hey it might be nice to stay right on Union Square and in the front of the Cable Car line, So you check the St Francis rates...ouch. Here's an alternative: The Handlery Hotel on Geary St right across from the St Francis. Although it's a small hotel, the rates aren't always fabulous because of it's location, when they are, grab a room. The hotel has 2 buildings. One is a newer building that backs onto Ofarrell St and the older section is the front where the lobby is located and is on Geary St. I stayed there several years ago when I attended a conference. I stayed in the older building which they call \"the historic rooms\". At that time, they up graded me to a room that had a sweet sitting room attached to it with sofas. This time they were having a promotion and I booked a \"historic room\". I requested a view if possible and I was given a room on Geary St. Do not make that mistake, I was wokened up at 3am by what I surmised as the clanging of garbage trucks. The room was small but had a quaint bay window in it. I usually don't mention bathroom size, but, this was the smallest bathroom for hotel room with the exception of Parisien hotels I've stayed in. They have done a nice job with decor. When you step into the hallway you can tell that this was an old hotel. The floors creaked when walking down the hall and plumbing pipes are mounted where you can see them as is some of the electrical ware. The stairway is narrow. Again, it is well decorated and reminds you that the heart of SF was bustling before indoor plumbing and electricity. But, here's the real plus-the location. You are 1/2 block from Macys, close to all the Union Square shopping, down the street from the Broadway type theaters, 3-4 blocks from shopping on Market St and the Hyde-Powel Cable Car turnaround. The staff will help you if you would like to catch a bus to ...? They also have a concierge. I did not use the pool, but it is encircled by both buildings so is protected from the wind. It is a fairly large size with a few tables and lounge chairs. It would be especially nice if traveling with children and having something for them to do at the end of a day of museums and shopping.

Like most moderately priced hotels in San Francisco, the Handlery is an old property. In one or two places, the carpet looks a little bit shabby. However, in all the ways that count, this is a nice comfortable, full-service hotel that may be one of the best values in this very expensive city. Accommodations On my latest trip, I had room 847, spacious and nicely furnished. It was larger than the room I had last year, perhaps because I mentioned that I had reviewed them for Tripadvisor. On the other hand, the bath was not quite as spacious. There was a desk with lamps, desk-top plugs, and a great chair, In addition to the desk, there was a large dining table. Under the large flat-screen TV there was a small refrigerator. I liked the interface on the TV. On the power on screen, there is a scroll that shows the available channels and their numbers. This saved me from having to scroll to find the channel that I wanted. Since I now watch movies on my iPad, I did not notice the movie selection or the prices but I would expect them to be good.. I almost forgot that there was a safe in my room. There was a coffee bar in the room, but since the weather was good, I just went across the street to one of the three Starbucks in the block. (Lest you think that is a lot of Starbucks, there is a spot on Market street from which one can count five Starbucks. There are another two closer than the furthest of the five but which one cannot see.) One of the advantages of an older property was the large walk-in closet. [I hate those tiny presses that pass for closets in \"modern\" hotels. ] The clock radio had a line-in connector for mobile computers. As an iPhone user, I might have liked an iPhone adapter but this arrangement accommodates my iPad, laptop, and your Android or Windows device. The king-size bed had a very comfortable mattress, plenty of big fluffy pillows and a bolster. There was a room service breakfast menu and order form on the bed. Okay, there was no scale in the bathroom. That is by way of saying that is the only thing I missed. All of the permanent and consumable amenities were there, including my favorite, the curved shower curtain bar that makes the shower seem more roomy. There was a generous supply of generous sized towels and was clothes. The modern plumbing delivered plenty of hot water. Amenities The Handlery offers all the amenities one would hope for, from a knowledgeable, polite, and helpful concierge to shampoo in the bath. There is a very nice pool in a large atrium, a barber-shop, a business center, and an exercise facility. While I did not avail myself of any of these things, they were all pleasant, well-equipped, and popular. While this is not a convention hotel, there is a small number of meeting rooms. Wireless Internet is $9.95 per day or $40- per week (per device). While free would be nice, this is cheaper than most commercial hotels. These think nothing of charging $20 per day on top of much higher room rates. (In the US, economy hotels include free Internet but luxury properties charge extra.) Last year, when I mentioned that I had three computers, they gave me a code.) There is a vending machine and an ice machine across from the elevator on all floors. Unlike most hotels, where one finds the vending machine by the noise, these are silent (Silent!) and out in the open. Dining is in the Daily Grill. For world travelers, the Grill is a very popular pub. You can find the menu on the web. I like it so well that I try to eat there at least once on any trip to San Francisco. Transportation The Handlery is at Union Square, the heart of San Francisco. The garage entrance is two blocks up Cyril Magnin from the Powell Street BART station, 30 minutes and $8.10 from SFO. One can spit from the front entrance to the Powell Street Cable Car. There is always a taxi queue at the door. (I shared a cab to the airport with a colleague; the fare was $66- before tip) San Francisco has world class public transportation and Google and the BART app, make it easy to use. However if you choose to drive, guest parking in the Handlery garage is $34.00 per day, a discount from the daily rate for those who are not guests. Other The Handlery is a no-smoking property and one must agree to a $250- cleaning charge if one violates this policy. Of course, many Americans prefer smoke-free properties. The result is fresh and pleasant atmosphere throughout. (I did notice an ash tray by the pool.) I hope that this review has helped you decide whether the Handlery is for you and that, if you choose it, you will have a pleasant stay.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood, central place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Charlotte F", "ReviewID": "UR125532929", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights in February 2012 and had a fine stay.

Whilst we did stay a little while ago, I am currently planning a trip back to America, and felt compelled to review the hotel. Originally, our travel agent here in Australia booked us into Hotel Union Square around the corner. We were forced to move from the hotel after being there for an hour because the room was filthy. While my mother and I decided what to do about our accomodation problems, we walked down the road and saw the Handerly. The exterior is beautiful; looks like a five star hotel and is extremely welcoming. While we were standing admiring the hotel (and wishing we were there instead of our disgusting hotel!) the concierge came out to us and asked us if we needed help. Even though it was raining and we weren't even in the hotel lobby, he came to help us. After telling him about our terrible hotel, he escorted us to the front desk. From there, the man at the desk helped us find a room. There were only two rooms available with two double beds; one near the pool or one near the lift. We chose to stay near the lift. Apart from the lovely staff helping us find a room, they also went out of their way again that night. We asked the concierge whether he thought a taxi would pick us up from the previous hotel and drive us around the corner with our two huge suitcases and two carry-on cases. We were expecting to either pay for a cab, or have to drag them up the street. While taking two bags around the corner may not sound difficult, by this point it was late at night and raining, and our bags were very heavy. The lovely concierge told us he would bring a trolley to the first hotel, and wheel it back for us to The Handerly. We were shocked by how kind and helpful he was! He told us to meet him in the Hotel Union Square lobby in 15 minutes with our bags packed. We walked back, and 15 minutes later when we stepped out of the lift, he was there with another staff member, who took our bags from us, walked us to the back entrance of The Handerly and took us straight to our room! The room was clean, quiet and had a nice view of the street. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location, and the restaurant and room service was brilliant. On the day we left, the concierge got us a taxi as soon as we asked and helped us with our bags. Our stay at the hotel was amazing; the staff were fantastic and helped us with anything we needed. The room was great and big, and the prices are reasonable. I am looking forward to staying at the Handerly again when I return to San Fran!

Approximately 5 days prior to our arrival, I received a call from hotel staff that the hotel's computer system had accidentally overbooked the evening of Wednesday, October 5 (the big Oracle conference was in town) and that we could NOT stay at the hotel that Wednesday evening. While I was quite upset that we couldn't stay there, management did two things to accommodate our family's inconvenience. First, and most importantly, they put us up at the St. Regis hotel Wednesday evening. We had a very comfortable sleep after flying all night coming in from the East coast! Second, upon our return to the Handlery Hotel early Thursday evening after a busy day of sightseeing, we found a nice \"Thank You for understanding\" basket filled with a bottle of wine, crackers, nuts, etc. waiting for us in our room from Jon Handlery, the President of Handlery Hotels, together with a very sincere apology for this inexcusable screw-up. Bottom Line: My wife and I felt they provided outstanding customer service to \"right the wrong\" that impacted our vacation. We stayed in a room in the new section that overlooked the pool and it was VERY quiet. I pretty much summarized the reviews I had read on TripAdvisor down to two key items: Stay in the new section and get a room overlooking the pool. Our room fulfilled both of those requirements. We had two queen sized beds and a room that, while not large, was spacious enough for a family of four. It was also a very clean room. The only negative, as others have pointed out, was that getting to the room required going up some stairs and then walking down a long hallway. Nonetheless, we didn't find it to be a great inconvenience. Location: This is what we really appreciated about the hotel. It's close to Starbucks, Union Square, a number of amazing restaurants and shops, the theatre district, and it was very close to a great breakfast diner right around the corner (Lori's Diner -- we ate there EVERY day for breakfast and my two kids, wife and I LOVED it!). For a few evenings where we came back late from sightseeing, the Daily Grill, connected to the Handlery Hotel, fit the bill for good overall American Cuisine. Steaks, pasta, hamburgers, seafood -- you name it, they got it. And the overall quality of the food was pretty decent.

Since I am not a tourist, my requirements are very specific regarding location, and I prefer to stay close to Union Square and lower Nob Hill because of transportation, ease of walking to my old haunts, and it being well-lit and well-traveled at night if I am alone on foot. The Handlery is in an excellent location, on Geary Street just off of Powell, with access to buses, cabs, and the Powell street cable car line. This is an older hotel, with a new and an old wing. I had stayed here in 2008 (booked through Expedia, as always) and stayed in the old wing. Those rooms are very small (when they say \"petite\" they mean it!) but had been given an upgrade so the bathroom was quite large. When I booked this trip I did not count on an upgrade due to my length of stay (5 nights) and I expected a small room and a small bathroom. Having read some recent reviews, I knew some recent guests had been surprised at the size of both, but I only stay at boutique hotels in San Francisco so I was prepared. Or so I thought. While the size of the room was in keeping with what I expected, the layout was not. The TV faced the desk, so I guess they expect guests to sit in a straight backed chair with their feet on their dresser to watch TV. ( Or watch with the eyes in the back of their heads while they sit at their desk?) If you want to watch TV in bed, you have to sit with your neck turned as the TV barely turns toward the bed. (Due to a nerve problem with my neck, I ended up with a migraine from this.) And then there is the bathroom. Because the ice machine is directly behind this room, 210, the bathroom is tiny. Oh, it's well lit (although the magnifying mirror on its extending arm was so high and far back on the wall as to do me no good, and I am 5'3\") but the shower (no tub) is LESS THAN FULL SIZE. It's not even a full stall shower! It's triangular in shape and the drain is almost at the threshold of the shower. I don't see how a taller or heavier person could have bathed effectively in it and God forbid a gal should try to (gasp!) shave her legs! In order to get under the shower head I was against the curtain (which, incidentally, smelled like a rancid dishrag). I have short hair so my showers are short but they were not relaxing and who needs a shower to be stressful? The staff were pleasant enough (although no bellman offered to help me with my gigantic suitcase and it took me no fewer than four phone calls to get a sharp knife when I wanted to slice some cheese one evening when I was eating cheese and crackers in my room) and other than the stinky shower curtain the room was clean. I did not ask to move rooms because their business center costs $5.00 per 20 minutes and I was not going to waste my time and money researching their website to see if 3/4 baths are mentioned anywhere. (They ARE NOT.) Even if they were, this hardly qualified as that shower was not even a full sized stall shower. I know--I have lived with several! If you consider this hotel, the absolute pluses are: location, cleanliness and the pleasant staff. But be prepared for TINY TINY TINY rooms and if you can, avoid room 210 unless you are there for a very short stay. I, for one, will not be back unless I can be assured that I will never have that small a bathroom again.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Titusville, FL", "Title": "\u201cLove the Handlery\u201d", "Author": "jpaq68", "ReviewID": "UR121558559", "Content": "A few years ago, while looking for a hotel in San Francisco, I chose the Handlery for the simple reason that it was near my favorite nightspot and I haven't wanted to stay anywhere else ever since.

On the third day, I booked a room and invited my friend. We only stayed one night but the experience was the best. When I booked, I asked for the conference rate because the official hotel was Handlery. I was given the conference rate without a problem for two doubles. I arrived and was initially given a handicapped accessible room with two twin beds. I had originally booked two doubles. I changed the room because the accessible bathroom had a big room to shower in with no shower curtain and a hand held shower head, the windows faced an outdoor hole in the hotel and I felt like I was in a closet with no air flow, and I am tall and can't sleep on a tiny twin bed. I simply asked to be changed. The front desk was calm and nice and had no problem with a switch. I was switched to a very small room with one double bed and had to switch again because of the mistake in needing two beds. No big deal. I went down stairs and waited in line again and was helped at the front desk. I had asked for just the courtesy of a window facing the street because I wanted air and to see the street, any street. The front desk clerk, Matthew, was looking in his black binder to find me a room with a street view and two beds. He has looked on several floors when I asked \"do suites have two beds.\" Matthew replied \"yes.\" He quickly booked me into a family suite for one night. When I got to the room, I was so happy. We had windows! Moreover, I was actually touched at the quality of the service. I went to the windows to catch a glimpse of the street and found that I had a corner room with a view of Union Square's Ice Skating Rink!!!! I also ended up with two rooms so I gave my friend, who put me up at her house for two nights, her own room. We opened the windows and had a great cross breeze and a fantastic view. This room was an entirely different experience. The other two rooms I had to get out of were both like closets. They actually gave me a feeling of being closed into a space that I was trapped in. I could not have stayed in either room. On the other hand, the room I ended up in (family suite) was the best because it had that open feel, the character of the older hotel and the best view I couldn't have dreamed up in my wish list. Each room had a flat screen TV, there was one walk in closet, a fridge and a coffee maker. The beds were great. The pillows varied and I slept fine until the protest at 7am on Sunday morning. There were protesters at the Frank Hotel that woke the entire block up with sirens and mega phone chanting and I resent that because we had been up early every day for the conference and Sunday was our only day to sleep. The noise wasn't too bad for being above the street and I slept fine until the protesters woke me. I don't sympathize with the protesters because of their wake up service. The window with the best view had a broken blind and it was some work to tie it up to really get that uninterrupted view while having company later on the night of our stay. I would choose the family suite again but not the regular rooms. The service was the best of any hotel and they worked with me every step of the way. Some rooms are VERY SMALL.

I did a bit of online research and found this hotel about 3 blocks away for about 1/3 the cost. It fit the bill perfectly. The check in was very smooth. We arrived early in the day and asked they store our luggage until a room was ready. I requested safekeeping for my laptop, and although they did not offer any, we decided what the heck. If it's missing, it's missing. The hotel is almost directly across from Union Square, which is a central meeting spot for the double decker bus tours. It's a relaxing way to see San Francisco with 'on and off' capabilities. Upon getting back to the hotel from this tour, our luggage was promptly retrieved and we were given a room key. We were in the historic section with a queen-sized bed. The room was kind of small, but I've come to believe that may be a 'norm' in historic hotels. The room was nicely appointed, comfortable bed, large flat-screen TV, coffee maker, etc. We never could seem to get the room to cool down, so we simply kept the windows open after the first night. Housekeeping service was very good too. The hotel is about three blocks from Market Street, perhaps five or six blocks to Chinatown. There are plenty of dining opportunitues all around, but we prefered the liesurely stroll to Chinatwon most evenings for some great cuisine. The trolly line is within a block and the Powell Station BART is only three blocks away (the best way to travel to and from the airport without a doubt...no traffic). The F line to Pier 33 (Alcatraz) and Fisherman's Warf was about four blocks away on Market Street if you wanted to take an F line trolley ($2 good for all day). High-end shopping was all within a block or two. It could not have been more central. I was in conferences all day, but the central location made it easy for my wife to enjoy liesurely strolls in the Union Square/Financial District/Chinatown areas. We went to the pool to see it, but never got in. The pool felt as though it was heated. It was outdoors and in a nice courtyard setting in the newer portion of the hotel. We also heard good things about the attached restaurant from some locals, but never tried it. It was too easy to simply walk around and find something. Our only complaint was the concierge seemed a little abrupt when we did seek advice. It may have simply been perception, but he didn't seem happy to help. We both noticed it on seperate occasions. But the front desk was just the opposite. Friendly and courteous at every opportunity. It was a great stay and given our research, seemed a reasonable price given other hotels in close proximity.

At 2:00 a.m. however, the night clubs/bars in the area closed down and believe me the party simply moved out onto the street \u2013 right under our window. The next morning (at 7:00 am), the picket line across the street, with bullhorns at full volume, fired back up to provide us with a wake up call we could have done without. We requested another room for our second night and were told to come back in about 6 hours and they would accommodate us. We were moved, but the trip was kind of a bummer as we slogged around the city after our first sleepless night.

We have not completed our stay here yet, however, I must say that this hotel does not come close to meeting our expectations. We even feel a bit uneasy giving a bad review because we are not picky travellers and have never had an experience like this. Throughout this California trip alone, we have stayed in 1-star motor inns, 4 star upscale hotels, and others in between. We have not had anything bad to say about any of our previous acconomodations, let alone what we have already experienced here. Our first encounter was with the valet parking service gentleman. I asked him if I could park my own car in the space as we had a lot of luggage that would require multiple trips. We also had some loose items that we wanted to pack away before unloading. He could barely speak English and just kept saying \"NO, I PARK, NO I PARK, YOU NO PARK\". We come from Toronto and are very used to multi-culturalism, however, we could not understand a word he was saying. I again asked him if I can park myself, and he said \"NO, YOU PAY $38 PER NIGHT AND I PARK\". We unloaded all of our luggage onto the driveway and gave him the keys. If he would have explained it's valet-only, it would have made more sense to me. He could also have offered to get someone to assist us with our bags. From there, we were standing in the parking garage without any idea of how to enter the hotel or reach the elevator. Very poor service and a frustrating/awkward conversation. Especially when it's your first impression. The front-desk lady was very pleasant and professional. She promptly gave us a run down on the hotel as she quickly checked us in. However, when we got to our room and turned on the A/C, it started dripping down water. Unfortunately, the vent is on the ceiling right by the door so we got the moldy water on us. Yes, moldy water. Looking up into the vent, there were green and brown spots of mold from where it was consistently dripping down. We called the front desk and the same lady apologized and set us up with our new room. A guy came to the room, apologized, and asked me if I tried to clean it off. I found that interesting as it seemed as if he was suggesting the hotel guest should attempt to clean mold off the AC unit. For the record, I did attempt to clean it off but it was caked on. The good news is that we are currently in the new room that is mold-free as expected. I'm sure these instances are isolated based on the other reviews. It just doesn't make sense how you can have a valet guy that barely speaks English and is rude and does not even point you in the right direction or offer help. Additionally, having a customer pay $150+ per night to have mold and water drip on them as soon as they open their room door? We are not ones to complain, however, our 1-star motor inn back in San Diego trumps the service here at the Handerly in San Francisco! Perhaps we just caught a new guy on the job and had bad luck on the room allocation, however, we cannot give this hotel a positive or even adequate review. It has left a very bad taste in our mouth and we will not be reccomending this hotel or returning.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sugarland, texas", "Title": "\u201cThe best choice for a visit\u201d", "Author": "michaelSugarland", "ReviewID": "UR116385096", "Content": "We just finished a week long visit @ the Handerly and you should consider it for several reasons. Its location is superb as it shares the block just off Union Square. By being this close you can walk to several superb restaurants, shopping and art galleries. You are also away from the tourist draw of Fishermans wharf and yet only a 8 minute drive via taylor street which is a straight shot north up and over some fun inclines. It features huge rooms with balconies (request new side only) a pool, restaurant and bar and a small work-out room with about 20 different dumbells to do a modest \"lift work-out\". Open computer room as well (5 stations)should you need to print anything. I used this about 4 times and never had to wait for a station. It is open 24/7 which is a plus. They also have a well-informed concierage team. We were in room 668 which I liked because you are above street noise and have a long distance view of surrounding city. No one could see inside our room so we could keep the drapes open and balcony door to let in a cool breeze and visually extend the length of our room. The outside balconies are huge in length and width ((14 feet by 7 feet) so you can actually use them and enjoy a morning coffee & paper session. If you have to have a starbucks and in a nice setting , the St. Regis is next door @ 2x the room cost but free to informed Handerly geusts who wander over in the mornings to enjoy their excellent pastries and marbled interior while downing a latte. There are several restaurants within walking distance but my favorite 3 were Dotties blue plate for bfast. A stunning place only 3 blocks away !! It should be noted that i went to Mammas to compare it versus Dotties for who is the king of bfast in San Fran and while Mammas is VERY good...its not even close to Dotties. I would stay @ the Handerly again just for the freedom to leave my room 7:15 am and be first in line for Dotties seating which only supports 25 people ! Johns grill which is only 2 blocks away and for great Italian...Scala only 1 block away. Equally impressive are the 6 galleries that surround the Handerly....all within 100 feet. Dali, Monet, Picasso ...it goes on and on. It truly is a mini-lourve experience and all for free. You know its good art when you see prices for $44,000 for one piece.. Another plus of the Handerly location is that you can walk to the Marakech magic theatre on Ofarrrell which was the highlight of our trip. Thats right, it topped our visit to Muir woods, Segway tour of city, bike ride over golden gate and into Sausalito and so on. Why is it so good? Peter Morrison who is the magician is simply amazing. Its not just the mind blowing tricks but its his personna and \"styling\" of the show. The theatre seats about 30 people and all are within 30 feet so sight lines are very good as is proximity. Additionally he gets several audience members to engage in magic which makes him all the more amazing as the audience has eye witnesses to \"how did he do that ?\" We did rent a car the whole week and I must say the garage staff were quick and polite in getting our car for us @ least once every day. Finally, the Handerly is also within walking distance of the punch line comedy club as went to see the Sklar Brothers there and laughed our ____ off. So all in all given the value of the hotels accomadations and the very fair price they charge with the surrounding options I truly believe its the only choice when in San Francisco !", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGreat, convenient hotel\u201d", "Author": "ACHCalgary", "ReviewID": "UR116283409", "Content": "Great hotel in a good central location for what we wanted to see.

(On a side note, I highly recommend the Muni Passport; we definitely got our money's worth.) I'd read many hotel reviews and found a frequent complaint of Union Square guests was the street noise. Because the Handlery is one of the few hotels with balcony rooms that face an interior courtyard (with a pool!), we were completely unaware of the outside world while we slept. Another common complaint in some of SF hotels is that the bathrooms were small--not at the Handlery! There was a separate vanity with a lighted magnifying mirror. I couldn't have been more pleased with the room. The service was very good, with one exception. I rarely needed concierge services, but the one time that I did I was not pleased with it. I noticed three different gentlemen serving at the concierge desk during our stay, and the one I asked for advice had an attitude. He wasn't very helpful regarding public transportation advice (saying twice, \"Just call a cab\" and as it turned out a cab wasn't necessary at all), and seemed critical of my restaurant research that I'd done beforehand.

I also e-mailed Mr. Handlery before we went letting him know how impressed I was with his personal responses and asking which room he would recommend for my family. He responded right away, gave me the recommendation and then asked for the ages of my granddaughters so he could have something in their room to remember San Francisco. When we checked in at the hotel, the clerk informed me there was a note on our reservation instructing the staff to call Mr. Handlery when we arrived. As soon as she called him, he came out to personally welcome us to the hotel. I have to say that this made all of us feel very special.

It was nicely appointed yet modest. Nice flat panel TV and bedding was terrific. Since we were in a room that was on a light well our room was very quiet. My friend stayed in #501 which faced the street and was woken up by the street noise. Even though we had no view, it was worth the extra sleep especially since we weren't in our room long at all. I do wish they had blackout curtains on the windows. Our room wasn't too bad but another in our party stayed in #634 and they got really early morning light since they were higher up. Bummer. Seems like it would be easy to fix. The front desk clerks were terrific. The concierge was a bit stuffy but helpful anyway. We've stayed at this hotel 4-5 years ago with our children when they were small. This is one of the only hotels around Union Square with a pool. It's still there and still lovely and fits the bill if you have kids and need a break from tourist stuff. It's not a pool to really sit out and sunbathe and has no jacuzzi. Although this isn't a 5-Star property we'll still come back here again and again due to the price, the location and the beds being very comfortable.

After the unavoidable and horrible long flights over from Australia, after which we always feel like we have crawled out of a dumpster, and probably look like we have too unfortunately, at a very early morning check-in, to our great joy and relief we were assigned a room immediately. Bliss. I observed all the Reception staff trying to assign all guests at check-in a room immediately. This is a very commendable practice and shows a hotel with not only well trained staff but a very tight and regimented house-keeping system. How intelligent. And rare! Well done folks. We had an 8th floor room on right side building facing the pool and it had a room like balcony, perfect. The rooms are very spacious and fitouts quite luxurious. The hotel is deceptively large, in a spread out way causing the occasional oddity with lift access up one level to one wing. The staff are abundant and more than obliging helping guests with luggage at all times. However the hotel does cater to guests requiring Handicapped facilities and special access or rooms. Location is perfect. Right in the Retail Centre and Union Square area and an easy walk up or down to the BART station at a cost of only $US 8.10 per person to/from airport. Effortless. Recommend buying the 2 day tickets for the Hop on Hop off Buses and definitely as many rides on the thrilling cable car/trams across as many routes as possible. San Francisco is a vibrant city and great for walking around. Our only negative experience. Ten years ago there was evidence of a drug problem in SFO. This time from the minute we arrived in the CBD we were constantly approached by homeless/beggars. I calculate we (very carefully) handed out what amounted to $US 50.00 in small change across the course of the 3 days. Great care needs to be taken in any public place, Hot Dog stands, the BART ticket machines, similar. They pounce. Usually it is just a request for the change but can be overwhelming.

We had breakfast vouchers which only allowed you one drink (either tea, OR coffee, OR orange juice).

Waiters were ok, but not up to the standard we had come to expect in america. Road noise wasn't as loud as the air con unit which we couldn't turn off or even change the settings! Definitely in need of an upgrade! Cleaning staff were good and were respectful of your schedule. Wifi cost us (per computer) $9.95 for 24 hours (Hotel Frank across the road had free wifi, only needed a password from reception).

The owner of the hotel was good enough to come out and meet us as we were know to him through a business contact, but unfortunately the rest of the staff were very stand offish.

The rooms are very small and it looks like they have been made small over the years to make room for bathrooms, as I believe at one stage, the guests used to share bathrooms on each floor. Overall I guess this was ok for a 3.5 star hotel, but it's distance from all things that are touristy in SF is a problem.

Bell hops (though we didn't need them) were on the ready outside the hotel. The lobby was in pristine condition and everyone greeted us with a smile upon entry. The check in process was a little troublesome but it was my bad. They let me use the business center to get the problem cleared up, went back to the desk and within 2 minutes the clerk handed me the key cards. That was the smoothest check-in I have ever encountered. When we first entered the room it was immaculate. Fresh clean linen, clean floor, clean bathroom, and brochures on the desk. There was also a 46 inch TV to boot (which we hardly used except for the morning news). The room was just large enough to keep my wife and I comfortable, but it's not like we were there 24 hours a day. Why vacation in SFO if your going to spend 18 hours a day locked up in the room. We pretty much woke up at 6 am, watched the news, left the hotel at 7 and didn't come back until 9 or 10 pm, so no complaints about room size for us. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in for a hotel. It was neither too hard nor too soft. I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. Either I was extremely comfortable or extremely tired from roaming the streets for 15 hours; either way I had 4 excellent nights sleep. I swear, so many people like to nit-pick, but this hotel is the best I have ever stayed. I had room 702 which over-looked Geary and it was a little noisy but the noise ceased at around 10 or 11 pm. There was no bathtub, but the shower suited us just fine. It was just enough to fit my 6'4\" 340 lbs frame. In other words, it got the job done. I hardly take tub baths anyway so it was all good with me. Everyday housekeeping made the room look just as it did when we checked in. Fresh bed linen everyday, new towels everyday, they did a fantastic job. I already had a trip itinerary prepared so I didn't need the concierge too much, but when we did need him, he was extremely informative and had great knowledge of SFO's public transportation system. That was very helpful because we didn't quite adhere to our schedule. The hotel was the perfect location for us. Half a block from Union Square, across the street from a MUNI bus stop, 3 blocks from Powell Street BART/MUNI station and the light rail stop. It's within walking distance of Chinatown also, but we chose to take the Powell/Mason cable car to get there. That stop was a 1 minute walk right out of the hotel. There are all kinds of breakfast spots within a block of the hotel, so there is never a shortage of new places to eat for breakfast. It is not even a 2 minute walk to Pinecrest Diner which serves up the fluffiest pancakes in SFO. Check-out was a breeze and we received our deposit with-in 48 hours of check-out. I guess if there was one complaint I can muster up would be the slow elevators, and there are only two elevators in the front lobby which are very tiny (they only hold 6 people). But that's not enough to knock a point off my rating. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is convenient to everything, very comfortable, affordable, and it's historic.

If you are in SF for short period as tourist - I highly recommend the following 3 tours: Alcatraz tour (but buy your tickets ahead online before your trip or you will face long lineups at the pier); the San Francisco Movie Tours (3-hour tour on small comfortable shuttle around the city, very enjoyable and you'll see so much of the city in that one tour alone -- sanfranciscomovietours.com). Young professional actor \"Wylie\" was our terrific and knowledgeable tour guide; and the Great Pacific Coast Tour (10-hour full day tour on small comfortable shuttle bus along coast to Monterey and Carmel by the Sea, with fantastic lunch at Casanova in Carmel). The day flies by, you'll be awestruck by the coastal scenery and the stops along the way. Our driver Peter (retired senior) was a terrific tour guide and his driving skills were first rate. We learned quickly that in San Francisco tipping is expected with all those who provide good service - so have lots of dollar bills handy for your stay - for waiters, for concierge, for tour drivers and guides. The BART train was handy way to get from SF Airport to Powell St. @ $8 each. And it was just a few blocks walk up to the Handlery Hotel in Union Square. Much cheaper than taking airport shuttles and cabs. Just be prepared to see a bit of the gritty side of SF - street people, pan handlers, all sorts of characters. Very much like Times Square in New York. But we found it safe to walk around the city during the day - but avoid doing so at nights. Certain streets are a bit rough and should be avoided - parts of Market St. and the Tenderloin district. We took the BART up to Berkeley downtown one afternoon and toured the lovely surroundings of \"U of California at Berkeley \"campus. Happened upon commencement activities - saw the students gowned up for their grad ceremonies. We will stay at the Handlery again if we return to SF one day.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bourne", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel in a central location .\u201d", "Author": "katiepops64", "ReviewID": "UR108927425", "Content": "Stayed at the Handlery for 2 days and we found the hotel to be perfect for what we needed .

After coming from 3 different hotels that had huge rooms with huge beds, it was a bit of shock to the system to open our door on the 7th floor and realise how small the room is.

Again, this could all be due to the previous huge rooms leaving an impression on us. Our 1st night was marred by the fire alarm screaming at 4am. No one\u2019s fault, but standing in the cold S.F. rain at 4am seems to influence your opinions. Perhaps the most shocking thing is the $38.00 a night car parking fee. i dont know if this is a S.F. thing, or a common practise in inner city hotels, but i thought it was a ridiculous amount.

My husband was timing a 5k for a group of conventioneers early in the A.M on Thursday. So, we arrived at 4 P.M. on Wednesday, in time to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. :) Our room was on the newer side \"Premier\" over the garage. Perfect location overlooking O'Farrell St. We had a spacious, King Premier balcony room. I just LOVED the location and it was on the 3rd floor, just as I requested. And, I really looked forward to the balcony! We were not disappointed! I just LOVE to watch the hustle and bustle of the city streets below. I had contacted Jon Handlery a few days before letting him now how impressed I am that he replies to everyone here on Trip Advisor. I also told him that my husband and I were spending one night at the Handlery for business and to celebrate our anniversay a month late. Next thing you know, he wrote me back even though he was out of the country, it turns out! And, he had his assistant contact me asking what we preferred--white or red wine, or champagne. So, when we walked into our room we were pleasantly greeted with a chilled bottle of bubbly and a bag of snacks and bottled water. And, a nice note. What a WONDERFUL gesture!! Thank you so much, Mr. Handlery! I loved the size of the room. It was perfect having a small couch and easy chair, as well as the desk. My husband needed to access the internet for business. It worked great! I notice the couch opens up as a bed, so there would have been room for our daughter! I really was impressed with the amenities in our room. Also, it really wasn't loud at night, even though we were facing the busy street. It wasn't a problem at all! I realize it wasn't a weekend. But, I love the city, so it wouldn't have bothered me. I loved the lighted make-up mirror and the little powder room, complete with cushioned, rolling stool. A very nice touch. The next morning there was a complimentary SF Chronicle newspaper at our door. And, after my husband got back from the 5k race, we both had a cup of coffee in the room. I would have preferred those little liquid half and half containers over the powdered creamer, however. :) But, the coffee was just fine, otherwise. Strong enough, too! The parking garage was a cinch. After initially working our way through the maze of stairs and hallways to arrive at the lobby, we never had to go over that way again. :) Since we stayed above the garage, it was easy just to take the elevator down and exit out on O'Farrell or pick up the car if needed. Very convenient. The ONLY thing I would change in our room is the MATTRESS and pillows. And, I mean the ONLY thing! :) I have to admit, I wasn't comfortable, although my husband slept like a baby. I'm used to my own feather pillow, as well as the less-poofy pillows I use against my back and between my knees. I also have THE most comfortable mattress in the world at home. Unfortunately, the mattress at the hotel seemed to dip toward the middle so I stayed more toward the edge. Again, I'm so used to my own bed, it's just hard to compare! The best hotel bed I ever slept in was a Heavenly Bed in Seattle a few years back. Oh my! I felt cradled in a firm, but gentle cloud. :) Handlery's bed-issue did NOT cause me to give it any less than 5 stars, though! Everything else about our stay was beyond perfect! That balcony was the selling point for ME! I will GLADLY book the same room or one close by at the Handlery Union Square again! Your family has really done an exceptional job with this hotel. I'm so glad that it's STAYING in the family, too!

Easy to get to Fishermans Wharf, the tourist area. I would not recommend the tour bus as a means of transport as its expensive, restrictive in hours and only goes one direction in the city. But do use it if you would like a spoken or pre-recorded guide of the city and making a day or half day of it. There are a couple of choices of routes but one ticket only covers the one route. Longer routes make journys more long winded. Consider the direction of the bus route before commiting to buying a day ticket, which is around $30. The bike route is recommended and caters for all abilities - you can do the entire route or just cycle part of it in one direction and take it on the ferry back to the hire shop.

The paint in the room was fine but it looked like a five year old cut in the corners (now that we all have access to the DIY channel we are all experts). I would have appreciated it if the clerk at the front counter let me know when checking in there was no view or no bath tub. By no view I mean no view, these old buildings sometimes have windows that open up into a opening that Is an air vent, and no tub fine but had the counter clear told me about the air shaft view and no tub I would have gladly paid more for a different room. I checked in Monday night and the place did not look full so I know there were different rooms available. I gave a four on value because I felt the price I payed was a little high for the room I received, I stay 1-2 nights in SF about 7 times a year and I day trip about once a month and I have a good idea what rooms should go for. I have a tip for first time visitors to San Francisco stay in the union square area, you can take public transportation to other parts of the city for your excursions. If you get a good room you can open your window and see and hear the cable cars going by. I will give you a warning there are some bad neighborhoods not far from union square.

We had a standard double room, with 2 double beds and it was quite a spacious room with coffee making facilites and hair dryer. The bathroom was clean and the shower was great. We did not have a view, but did not mind as we were sight seeing all day. We did not have the noise from the street either, so it was very quite at night time. Although we were supposed to be room only, we got complimentary breakfast for the 3 days. This was a choice of hot American breakfast with toast, Waffle or granola and fruit and a selction of tea or coffee. This was a pleasant surprise and very generally service at breakfast was excellent, although was often very busy. The hotel was centrally located and just a few minutes walk from the centre of Union Square, the Powell & Mason Cable Car and numerous shops and large department stores. We would recommend staying here rather than Fishermans Warf and Pier 33, as you can travel don to these areas during the day. For us there were several highlights of San Fransisco. Alcatraz was excellent (book online in advance through Alcatraz Cruises, approx $26 each for early bird tour - alot less people at this time). It was great to see the Golden Gate Bridge (although very foggy the first day we were there), eat in the Cliff House Restaurant, visit Golden Gate Park,take in a ball game only a few stops away),Pier 33 and all the usual tourist spots. If travelling on the Cable Car (return journey is approx $10 each) you still need to queue after you have bought the tickets. Even though the homeless guy in the orange vest is shouting that you don't need to! Do be careful as lots of homeless people about and do not walk to the left (away from Union Square) when you me out of the hotel. Generally though, San Fransisco seems fairly safe, just be careful of wallets etc as in any large city. We only wish we had longer in SF as 3 nights was not enough to see all the attractions. Next time we would like to do the Alcatraz night time tour and the movie tour.

We primary selected this hotel as compared to some of the large chain hotels because of 1) more affordable daily parking rate, 2) complimentary refrigerator in the room, 3) location and 4) daily room rate. My husband, myself and our 2 1/2 year old son and 3 week old daughter shared the room. This hotel is in an ideal location right in the heart of Union Square and near several eateries like Cheesecake Factory, Chipotle, Burger Bar and several fast food places and convenience stores. Honestly, the location couldn't have been better. We arrived around 7pm on a Friday night and were upstairs and in our room by 8pm. We met a few challenges on our first night which were concerning to myself as both a mother and a pediatric ER doctor. Parking is located on the ground level and is valet-only. Because of the way parking is set up, you need to get everything out of your car quickly so that the next person can move in to unload as well. This was extremely difficulty while traveling with children when you have a stroller and a ton of luggage and \"kids things\". We generally like to be self-sufficient in an attempt to save some money (ie: I don't like to have a bell man carry my luggage for a fee when I'm perfectly capable of doing it myself for free). After unloading however, we were informed that there was no way to access the lobby from the garage with a stroller as there is an obligatory flight of stairs between two portions of the lobby. They offered a bell-man to take us back a \"secret elevator\" to the lobby which I was not thrilled about knowing that we were now being forced to use the service because of lack of handicapped access. I asked if there would be a charge for the bell service (never having been to San Fran before, I wasn't sure, as there was a fee for parking etc). and Lawrence (bell-man) responded with \"A tip will do\". Wow. Tacky. And....embarrassing for us as we did not have any cash on us. I'm a firm believer that an establishment should pay its employees a fair wage being that tipping is not mandatory instead of relying on its customers to pay them in tips, and if service is above average, I'll tip. I guess I just don't see why I should give them extra money for doing their job. So basically if you have a stroller or a wheelchair you will be using the bell service and tips are expected so bring cash. There are two sides to the hotel (historic and new). The new side is not connected to the lobby completely by one set of elevators and you need to go up either a very historic looking wheelchair lift for one flight and then transfer to the main elevators or carry your stroller / wheelchair up a flight of stairs so there are obvious safety concerns there. Had we known about this, we probably would have booked elsewhere as it made every adventure outside very difficult with the stroller. The room was very nice however on the first night our room faced O'Farrell street, home to an Irish pub. Extremely loud music was blasted until 1 am or so and the noise from the street was extremely loud, so much that our family pretty much didn't sleep all night.. If you're going out on the town at night and want to have city views this is probably fine. However for a family with two small children on business, this was not ideal. We asked for a room switch which was granted the next day to a room facing the pool, on the interior of the hotel and had a wonderful two nights of sleep there. The manager that switched us was very friendly going out of his way to help with storage of our items during the room switch and the other manager we encountered, Catherine, was wonderful and helpful as well. The Daily Grill inside the hotel is small but very good. The refrigerator worked well for breast-milk storage which was a major concern of mine while traveling with such a young baby. Again, this hotel is probably great for couples without children or needing wheelchair / stroller access but proved to be a bit difficult for us.

Our room was clean and spacious. We did have an 'industrial rooftop view' to one side and a view of the courtyard to the other. It was my husband's birthday and we were delighted to be left a bottle of fizz and a basket of goodies too. We had collected our car immediately from the airport which meant we had to park at the hotel. The cost is expensive compared to London city centre hotels but seemed the same everywhere we stayed in California. I think the location is fantastic. You walk right out of the front door and you are on Union Square with one of the famous cable car lines right there. You can take this cable car to get to Fishermans wharf. We had considered booking a hotel at Fishermans Wharf but having visited I would definitely recommend a stay around Union Square. If we go back (which I am sure we will!) we will definitely stay at The Handlery again. P.S Three top tips: 1.) ride the cable cars first thing in the morning for fab experience without crowds. 2.)

The family-owned hotel, one block off Union Square, has been recently renovated and the \"moderate\" double/double room in the \"Historic\" part of the hotel was spacious, clean, quiet(we asked for a quiet room on an upper floor), and very well-outfitted. The beds were comfortable. A welcoming basket of \"goodies\" was also a surprise. The bathroom, while small, had all conveniences, including a magnifying mirror and a pullout clothes line in the stall shower to rinse out sox, etc. The niche for the toilet was narrow, and I would not recommend a heavy person to stay in this particular room, although I am sure there are other rooms in the hotel that have a different configuration. The A/C had a thermostatic control, and while a little noisy, worked well. Also appreciated was the iron, ironing board, and small safe in the closet. The little frig was very convenient to hold the two complimentary bottles of spring water given to us with the goodies basket. All hotel personnel were pleasant and friendly.

It's also close to the trains and tourist information and plenty of shops , both high street and designer. The hotel has a restauraunt and offers room service but we didn't eat there as there were so many great places to eat and takeaways nearby. We had a twin room which was quite small but adequate for our needs as we spent most of the time out and about. Our room had twin queen size beds, a TV, fridge and coffee maker and a small bathroom with a shower/bath. There is a swimming pool at the hotel which we didn't use as it was a bit cold during our stay to be swimming out doors. If you don't have a laptop computer you can log on in the hotels computer room ( 5 terminals ) by purchasing a token for 20 minutes useage for $5 or pay by credit card. The hotel has what I'd call proper old fashioned customer service. There's a Bell Boy to help with luggage and a Concierge who knows all about the best places to eat etc and will book tables, excursions , airport transfers for you. During our stay we did two excursions booked through Viator. The first was a half day trip to Muir Woods to see the Giant Redwoods and a visit to Sausalito. We chose the afternoon departure so we could have a lie in and it was a great trip out . Muir Woods was so tranquil but quite cool at times so take a jacket. Sausalito was beautiful and the market there was fab - biggest and best strawberies I've ever tasted. We also got some great pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge on our way out. We also did the day trip to Yosemite National Park which was a very long day with an early start but well worth it. Stunning scenery at Yosemite but dissapointingly we were unable to see the Giant Sequioas as late snow prevented the coach acessing the area. The quides on both trips were really friendly and informative and certainly earned their tip. All excursions included pick up and drop of at our hotel and were puntual.

This hotel was recommended to me by a San Francisco native. It was a fantastic location at Union Square--very convenient to cable car lines, ticket booth, restaurants, etc. My GPS directed us right to the front entrance of the hotel; problem was that there was NO PARKING there. My friend stayed in the car while I ran in and checked in. Note that the desk clerk told me that, before 4 p.m., this is doable but the cops will start ticketing at 4 p.m. if you try to stay parked there (due to rush hour, I guess). The hotel is huge and built around an interior pool deck, which is really nice; however, this makes for a LONG walk if, like me, you asked for a city view and prefer to talk to the desk or concierge in person vs. by phone. When checking in, I was asked if I wanted city view or pool view. The clerk told me that city view is nice but can be noisy, but I was there to see the city so I chose it anyway. It WAS noisy. If I was to stay there again, I'd choose the pool view. The garage entrance is on another street. Parking in the garage is $38 a day!!! You can include parking in your room rate (maybe they give you a break on the rate if it's included in the room), but I wasn't sure if my friend was staying in the city with me or not (she lives in the suburbs), so I didn't include parking in my rate and had to pay it separately. The room was VERY nice--beautiful, in fact. Nicely appointed with 2 elegantly-made and comfortable queen beds, a flat-screen TV, a desk and quality office chair and a cabinet with mini fridge and coffeemaker. There was, however, no microwave. The bathroom is fine, though my friend was disappointed that the sink wasn't outside the bathroom like it was in our Yosemite hotels. I actually preferred that, since I'm the one that's up in the middle of the nite to use the bathroom and having the sink inside the bathroom meant I didn't have to worry as much about waking her when I got up at 3 a.m. Sleeping in the room, however, was NOT very nice. Between the obnoxiously loud grinding noise from the air conditioning system and the incredibly intrusive noise from the street (given that we were 4 floors up from ground level), sleeping was not easy. The AC noise bothered me more than the street noise, where the opposite was true for my friend, who was sleeping in the bed closest to the outside wall. Also, the thermostat for the AC system was very confusing--not done by temp (unless it was metric!). Another disappointment was that this beautiful luxury hotel had no exhaust fan in the bathroom. Even the no-frills motel we stayed at in Oakhurst had that! Finally, I had booked the room and I checked in. I was not asked if anyone was staying with me, though I told them I had a friend waiting outside due to no parking. I was given 4 keycards (why 4, I don't know), but my friend's keycards expired within 24 hours of us being there and she got locked out. The desk refused to let her up until they reached me, but I was in the shower when this happened and my friend was very nearly late to get ready for dinner and the theatre that night by the time they reached me. We ate in the on-site restaurant, the Daily Grill, for a light dinner on Saturday evening. We were seated immediately in a comfortable booth, and loved our waiter, who was not only a good waiter but very cute and personable. My friend had a dinner salad with ahi tuna and said it was very good. I had a side salad with house vinaigrette and the 3-cheese mac & cheese from the sides menu and both were excellent. Would I stay there again? Yes, probably, as I thought it was a beautiful hotel and it is in a great location.

The cable cars are located just around the corner and is an excellent way to get around the city. And if you want to travel by taxi, they are usually parked right outside.

There are numerous shops surrounding the hotel that display art. And the hotel is a block away from Union Square where if you love to shop, you'll be in heaven. We also found a 24-hour diner (Lori's Diner) just around the corner. It's a diner that takes you back to the 50's.

Other things: we took the boat to Alcatraz which is well worth a visit, as is Fisherman's Wharf area. We also walked a lot - through Chinatown, Italian area, up to Coit Tower, Embarcardero and took the tram to Lombard Street. Ate cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory in Macy's. A good cafe/restaurant for breakfast is Tads Diner on a street just off Union Square down from the Handlery. We met friends who live near San Francisco for a day and they took us to Muir Woods and Sonoma (wine tasting) both of which are worth a visit.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Hotel, excellent service\u201d", "Author": "Hayley244154", "ReviewID": "UR62208447", "Content": "We have just returned from the Handlery union square.

Lobby and pool were impressive, and the location is great, but the historic section in this hotel has a definite odour (mold, mildew?) even after the \"so called\" renovations. Our room and bathroom were so small you could hardly swing a cat! The air conditioner/air exchanger was not working properly so along with a mouldy smell it was very hot and we could not open the window as no screen and sirens were going all night long. Upon arrival the clerk was sure to let us know that we had the \"internet rate\" and for an additional $30 per night we could upgrade - not very good business practice in my opinion. Very deceiving on the part of this hotel and Kayak as our room looked nothing like the photo and it was non-refundable so we had no option but to stay here for 3 nights. Even the bellman admitted the room was small and gave us this lame excuse that \"people were smaller back in the old days\". We are not LARGE people, this room would have been too small for 2 of Snow White's dwarfs! He did offer to see if there was another room \"a bit larger\" in the same section of the hotel but this should have been given to us in the first place! The hotel certainly did not appear to be at full capacity so why stick people in the worst hotel room you have?

We stayed here at the Handlery after recommendations from a friend and also the reviews here on trip adviser and we think you couldn't pick a better spot for your stay in San Francisco. This was a surprise trip for my other half for his 40th birthday and we were made to feel as special as this occasion warranted, including being greeted on arrival by the General Manager Jon Handlery himself! (we wish we could have seen him at the end of our stay too to say a big thank you) From the moment we walked through the door we knew we had chosen well, all the staff from the porters to the concierge were so friendly and helpful, this excellent service continued thoughout our stay and made it such a great experience. In particular the concierge Dale with his endless patience at my questions even before the trip when we were still in the UK! He seemed to know the answer to everything and have a timetable for everything too! The doorman Hermie was also a delight, a wonderful person to greet you in the morning before you head out and welcome you back in the evening with a smile. The room was wonderful, well appointed with coffee maker, hairdryer, fridge etc we wanted for nothing. The hotel has just been completely refurbished, we stayed in the historic quarter and it couldn't have been better for us, just charming with excellent views over the streets we had come to visit. We felt right at home! The pool is always warm by the way so pack your trunks you'll need them! We enjoyed a swim on several occasions and it's the perfect way to start or end a day. We found the hotel to be very clean in both the room and public areas, couldn't fault them there either! The toiletries are ethical and they are good too - you can trust the shampoo ladies! You won't struggle to find excellent eateries or things to do in the area either, we can recommend extranomical advertures for a wine tasting tour to Sonoma and we also went to Yosemite with them. The concierge would be happy to arrange any trips with these or other providers when you arrive so don't feel you need to book everything in advance (although we would urge you to book your Alcatraz trip as far in advance as you can online - we've seen the queues!) The Handlery is clearly a popular hotel as it's on every tour companies pick up list, meaning you will be picked up and dropped off right at your hotel door. Breakfast wise you are so spoilt for choice, personally we favoured Cafe Mason just round the corner for blintzies (sweet soft cheese filled pancakes with fruit), Max's over the road for pancakes and Pinecrest for 24hr service with a smile! Try as many diners as you can though we had a different breakfast every day. For dinner, if you have a few pennies spare splash out at Farrallon on Post St (you'll need to book at least on the weekend) it's a unique dining experience with food to match the decor! On most nights we stayed mainly in the French quarter on Claude Lane for quality food at reasonable prices with masses of atmosphere. The Handlery Hotel is located literally a few minutes walk from the Powell St Cable car turnaround so you can get to the wharf quickly and scenically or just about anywhere really if you fancy dinner in another area of the city. Cable cars stop after midnight so you have plenty of chance to get home and the wharf is only about 45 mins to walk anyway (though easier when it's cooler - all those lovely hills!) Buses and trams also all seem to run from this area so it's the perfect base for everything you will need to get to. Take the BART from the airport it's only 30 mins and they run every 15. For $8.10 each way you can't go wrong and you just have a couple of minutes walk from Powell St BART station to the hotel itself, time to soak up the vibe! The ticket machine at the airport shows you simply how to buy a ticket so you don't even have that to worry about. Hire a bike from Blazing Saddles on Mason Street, the guy there, Jeff is much more helpful than the outlet they have at the wharf and he'll take the time to show you the flatest routes too! We were very glad not to have chosen a hotel on Fisherman's Wharf, the area in parts is charming in the day, for example the Blue Mermaid for clam chowder in the sun at the Cannery is lovely, however we personally found Pier 39 a bit too much (all amusements and tourist shops) and preferred the city bustle of Union Square rather than the tourist traffic of the Wharf and Embarcadero area. Union Square and the surrounding streets are fascinating and the buskers and different shops make for a real buzz that you'll miss when you leave! Well we are missing it anyway! We had a peek at some of the other hotels in the square when we went out for drinks, they seemed to be all lobby and no substance behind to us but then we were spoilt with the Handlery! The Starlight bar at the Westin even charges it's own visitors $5 to go to their own bar for a drink - we thought that was outrageous! So in short, you won't regret a stay at the Handlery on Union Square, we'll certainly be returning as soon as we can, we got engaged in Golden Gate park on our last day there so I think a few anniversary visits are also in order! We've recommended the hotel to all our friends and you can't get a better commendation than that.

The heating systems are louder than a vacuum cleaner. This place should just give up and advertise hourly rates. Did I mention that I got athlete's foot from their disgusting carpets? Incidentally, the internet is even worse than the cleanliness. I do not exaggerate when I say I've seen more reliable service from third-world dialup ISPs. I was there for a scientific conference, and I learned that the hotel internet consists of a single, very overloaded DSL line. No one can connect to anything -- even Gmail is impossible durnig peak hours.

This does mean though that if you have a street facing room, you MUST take ear plugs as there is no double glazing. The public transport routes are also right on the doorstep so it means you have quick and easy access to the whole city (a daily pass is $9 or a single bus ticket is $2, though this allows travel for a further 90 mins if you want to swap buses). I would recommend the hop on/hop off super bus tour (blue bus) as a way to get to grips with the layout and size of the city once you arrive, plus you can learn some amazing facts from the eager tour guides...great for pub quizzes!! The Daily Grill restaurant isattached to the Handlery and has an excellent menu, though I never managed to get beyond the amazing pork chop in blackberry sauce - wow! The main road nearby, Powell, has too many eating places to list, though Cafe Bellini deserves a special mention for its great breakfasts and dinners, which are very reasonably priced. The ferries are very straightforward to get to by bus and offer a cheap way to get close to Alcatraz if you don't want a full tour and then gives you a stop in Sausolito, which is an idyllic coastal 'village'. We took the evening Alcatraz tour (4.30pm) which menat that we arrived in the light but managed to see the sunset over the Golden Gate Bridge before we left the island after dark. This tour has only one boat load, rather than the regular 3 or 4 during the day, so you really get a feel of the place and can find yourself being the only one in the main cell building - quite a chilling experience! A ride west (to 33rd) on the 38 bus, from outside the Handlery, takes you to the golf course at Lincoln Park which is the home to the Legion of Honour Museum, a small and welcoming art museum. The museum looks over the bay to the bridge and beyond to the centre of the city, so cameras are essential!

There seems to be a serious problem with homeless people and beggars in San Franciso, but there were not any on Geary, I think because of the harsh wind that whips up that particular street. The hotel was exactly as it represented itself, except for one of the front desk people. She was very stern and less than friendly. Actually just a little too stern, and bordering on the verge of rude. I was actually reprimanded by her on checkout to stand away from the desk until others before me were finished checking out. She made me feel like a small child who had done something wrong. Not quite the proper handling of guests as far as I am concerned. Even the couple waiting behind me commented on her behavior towards me. There was no smiling at all from her when she checked us in or when she checked us out. Beyond that, the only thing that I was surprised about was that the hotel does not at this time have a microwave oven available to guests except in the employee lunch area. I find that when I travel, restaurants always serve too much food, and so I bring it back to my room with me. Most hotels have a microwave available for guests to use. Maybe that is just a temporary situation, but my pasta would not have been very good cold and I didn't feel comfortable intruding on the employees to warm my food. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. I liked the location and appreciated the fact that there were no homeless people hanging around outside the hotel, as they seem to cover every block of the entire city.

I had a copy of my online reservation that showed I booked, and paid more for, a Club room. The man at the desk went into a room and then came back and said they could give me a Club room facing the pool. I had room 381, which seemed to be in a section of the hotel that was in between the old and the new. It was two stories tall and surrounded two sides of the pool. It had the look of an old motor court motel with outside hallways to get to your room. I could see across the pool to the new 8 story Club section, which is where I thought I would get a room. Once I opened the door to room 381, I saw a HUGE dark stain on the carpet. There were also multiple stains on the small couch. I could tell the hotel was calling this a \"club\" room since it had bathrobes and the electric shoe polisher. I noticed the shoe polisher was unplugged due to the lower half of the electircal outlet was cracked off and missing. There was just a hole, which seemed dangerous. There was also a crack in the light switch in the bathroom. The surfaces of furniture looked clean, but any ledges on the sides were full of dust. Also, the door frame in the bathroom had a filthy layer of some nasty gunk stuck to the frame. There was a small stool that pulled out in front of the mirror to sit on when you dress. It was also stained. I booked this room for $188 a night. There are so many other small hotels in the area, I'm sure you could find a cleaner one. The main positive to the hotel is its location on Union Square-- cable cars stop right on the corner and you can walk to Chinatown. Also, there is a heated pool, which is hard to find in San Francisco.

We had a choice of street view or pool view from our balcony. Although we knew it would be noisier, we thought the street view would be more interesting. It was both! The sliding glass door was not up to blocking out the street noise, which I think is probably not possible. However, being city dwellers anyway, street noise is normal for us and was not a problem. If you want quiet, though, request a pool view! As far as the other comments about the two parts of the hotel: it is strange, but not horrible. There are definitely ways to avoid problems.If you are driving your own car, stay in the new section. There is an elevator directly from the garage to your section. If you are not driving, stay in the original section or ask a bellman to take your luggage to the new section for you. You do have to walk a fair ways, including stairs. We mostly entered through the garage entrance (which is on the block behind, O'Farrell) even when we had been out on foot since it was more direct. There is a wheel chair lift to get to the new section from the old if you are not able to drive around to the back and enter through the garage. I think I read one review that said it was a scary elevator due to the low, exposed side walls. It is a standard interior wheel chair lift, not an elevator. They are not designed to be closed in. The location was very convenient to shopping, eating, and the theaters. We had a great time walking around the area. We had a special anniversary dinner at Morton's.

Given our visit was for leisure and sightseeing, the hotels location adjacent to Union Square was perfect, it was vary easy to walk around Union Square (with it's artist's displays) and to the adjacent shops - Westfields Mall was some 300 yards away and the Powell / Market Street Cable car terminus was only 250 yards away. But back to the hotel itself - our room in the Historic Quarter of the Hotel was spacious, with a King Size bed and the decor was spotless. There was an adequate size bathroom which was kept well stocked. The facilities at the Hotel were also very good, although we did not use the Gym or the pool, we did (due to the wonderful weather during our stay) sit around around the pool to relax on some afternoons. The Daily Grill provided an excellent breakfast, although we did not eat there during the evening, (preferring to sample the various cuisines within the city) but the menu looked most inviting. Finally, the hotel staff - from our check in to our check out - all the staff without exception were most helpful and extremely courteous and the concierge was a mine of information on good restaurants, site seeing trips and places of interest - he even booked our Alcatraz Tickets for us. All in all, the Handlery on Union Square was a excellent place to stay. A few general comments on our stay - on Market Street itself (300 yards from the hotel)one could catch trams which (Senior Citizens note that for a flat rate $1.5 per person)) went all the way to Fisherman's Wharf and the Cannery building. Prior to our visit we also pre booked (by the Internet) a City Tours and a Wine Country tour, both through a company called http://www.bitours.com/ - although the tours themselves were provided by the Great Pacific Tour Company. Both tours were very well organised (we were picked up from / returned to out hotel) and the guides were very knowledgeable and courteous.

At check-in we were given a deluxe room in the \u201cnewer\u201d part of the hotel. It was a long room with small balcony overlooking the pool. The furniture was tattered and gross. I called down to ask for a for a room change. The helpful front desk changed our room to a suite in the main building. I asked if that meant that the suite was in worse shape, since it was in the older original part of the hotel. She said that it was a better room. Since it was overlooking Union Square. And those rooms do not get as much use. I should have suspected something at that point. But the suite was really charming. Big living room for the kids to run around with lots of light beaming in through the windows. Off to explore the city we went. That evening we came back to find that music from Union Square was louder in our room than it was outside on our way back to the hotel. The kids could not get sleep from how loud the noise was bouncing off the building across the street in into our suite. I called down and the same person that had help us earlier apologized and said that the band playing was doing so illegally and they are supposed to stop by 10 pm! We had the option to call the SFPD to complain. They had no control over the noise. Though she could switch us to a quieter room. Luckily we had not unpacked. I was checking out our 3rd suite with a walk-in closet. When I heard my son say \u201clook mom we are really up high\u201d. His head was sticking out of our 8th floor window that had been left wide open. I closed it immediately and found that the lock did not work. There was not a single safety lock on any of the 5 windows in the room. Exhausted we just went to bed. Not before finding that water pressure in this part of the hotel was abysmal. We were determined to have a good time and not spend our time switching rooms. Instead, we should have switched hotels. The problems with this hotel are far beyond the control of the staff. The problem is with those in charge who are not closing it down to make much-needed upgrades. Or even just install new double-paned windows with safety latches to keep the noise out and children safe in their rooms. The staff is doing the best they can with what they\u2019ve got.

My assessment of the hotel is that, as with most things, it has good and bad points, but mostly good ones. The good\u2014the location is very convenient for shopping and transportation, the beds were perfect, and the sheet/comforter arrangement was a new concept to me, one I liked a lot (instead of a bedspread or comforter cover\u2014which never seems clean\u2014the comforter was sandwiched between two sheets with a small throw on top [ignored as probably not clean\u2014see above] so we all felt great about lying on the bed to relax, which, of course, you have to do, since there are only two chairs). The toiletries provided were generous and smelled wonderful. Most of the staff seemed competent, friendly and helpful, the attached restaurant is good (not great\u2014some things were very good, others mediocre\u2014I\u2019d stay away from the cheeseburger, which is way too big and pretty blah), and the staff there were all extremely pleasant. The bad\u2014our room could have been cleaner. It wasn\u2019t horrible, but there were coffee spots on the tray under the coffeepot that were there when we arrived and still there when we left. The floor seemed pretty clean, and the major horizontal surfaces had been dusted, but all the minor horizontal surface (for example, the top of the hairdryer, the top edges of the light switches, the smaller shelves) were quite dusty. The pipe that provided water to the toilet leaked every time we flushed, and made a puddle on the floor. We reported this at the desk when we went out for the day, and the leak seemed to be a little less when we came back, but it wasn\u2019t fixed and we continued to have a wet bath mat on the floor. This exacerbated the damp bathroom problem\u2014there\u2019s no exhaust fan, so the room stays pretty humid, which is probably why there\u2019s mildew in the grout of the shower. Our room number was 660, in the club section of the hotel. This room is immediately adjacent to the elevators, and, while they were not so noisy that they kept us awake, we could hear them quite clearly, so people who are sensitive to noises should probably ask for a different room. The other thing about this room is that it doesn\u2019t have a little balcony, like the rest of the corridor\u2014the sliding glass doors open, and there\u2019s a metal railing to keep you from jumping or falling, but there\u2019s nowhere to go but down. It was pouring most of our trip, so we didn\u2019t miss having a balcony, but in the summer I think I would have. The base of the sliding doors\u2014the metal frame\u2014was quite rusted, and that further undermined my faith in the stability of the metal railing\u2014I was afraid it would give way if my son leaned on it. We wanted to stay in and watch a movie one night, but the television couldn\u2019t download the movie from the mother ship, or something, so we weren\u2019t able to. The staff couldn\u2019t fix it that night, but they did take the $12.99 off our bill (actually, they said they would, but they didn\u2019t\u2014if we hadn\u2019t caught it, we would have been billed, but they were cheerful about removing it when we pointed it out). One last thing--don\u2019t let the words \u201cheated pool\u201d fool you into thinking you\u2019ll be able to swim in February, you won\u2019t\u2014heating keeps the temperature barely tepid, but since it\u2019s outdoors, only a masochist would jump in. There\u2019s a sauna, but since our key cards never worked on the door, we didn\u2019t get a chance to see it. I see I\u2019ve spent a lot more time talking about the bad things, and I want to make it clear that we weren\u2019t unhappy there\u2014they were very nice and we were comfortable, overall\u2014but a little more attention to housekeeping, maintenance and the physical plant would move them up to another level.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cBest location..room quite small\u201d", "Author": "island085", "ReviewID": "UR25722124", "Content": "Stayed back in October 2008.

The room was very nice but the problem was getting there, u either need to take many stairs or an elevator for the handicap that was a little scary (not your normal elevator). I would not recomend staying in the nicer section of the hotel if u or someone in your group has a problem getting around. The location of this hotel is awesome for everthing, shopping, theater , restaurants and bars. My daughter and i went out after we got back from the theater to a Irish pub right across the street from the back side of the hotel on O'Farrel st.. The bar was a lot of fun they had dueling pianos. I am usualy pretty whimpy about going out at nite in the city, but since the bar was right across the street i felt pretty safe. FYI they lock the hotel door at nite at the back of the hotel on O'Farrel but u can use your room key to get in. That made me feel very safe too. I would deffinatly stay here again but just probably not with mom.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cOnly Good if you Upgrade\u201d", "Author": "BrisbaneSmiley", "ReviewID": "UR24879556", "Content": "The Handlrey is basically two hotels in one.

I was unsure as we were travelling a long way about 'which' hotel to pick so I decided to e.mail Jon Handlery, I had a reply within 24hrs that was personal, and answered my questions, We booked and we were so glad we choose the Handlery. From the minute we arrived the staff were welcoming, friendly and informative. After the long flights, I expected to feel overwhelmed, however the staff and effeciency of the hotel made us feel at home almost straight away. The room we were allocated was fantastic, quiet, beautiful decor, very comfortable bed, plenty of space and we were thrilled that we had a complimentary bottle of champagne and goodies...I had mentioned beforehand that it was our 25th wedding anniversary!!! haha Make sure that you dine and have evening drinks in hotel 'eatery/bar'. We had breakfast and evening meals and what great service, food and drink. We wandered round San Francisco in the evening, trying many bars and visiting other hotels but I can honestly say that the Handerly was in our opinion the best, with a great atmosphere and we will definately recommend it to family and friends and hopefully return soon!!!

This hotel did not live up to my expectations based on all the positive reviews I read on the internet. We chose an older hotel for the historic value and ambiance knowing it would probably not have up to date technology or ammenities but this was really disappointing. The 6th floor room (hotel has 7 floors) was incredibly hot and stuffy for 3 of the 4 days we were there.

Do NOT attempt to use the TV/Internet. Go to the 2nd floor business office and use the computers there. The room was tiny for 4 adult sized people and 2 double beds. The furnishings were pitiful - not enough storage space or chairs. The closet was equally tiny. The bathroom had only a shower stall that \"spit\" water at you, only one shelf for personal items. One of the two bed lamps was not functional. Housekeeping kept leaving glasses, mugs and coffee for 2 despite the fact that there were 4 of us staying there. Room was dingy and uninviting.

It was my second visit to SFO but the first for everyone else. With 2 small children we wanted to stay somewhere central with easy access to transport. We were not disappointed from that respect with the Handlery. Shops galore and the cable car practically at the door step. We were in a club room so after checking in, the easiest access from and to our room was from the O'Farrell St entrance. There were renovations being undertaken at the time we stayed but we were unaffected aside from the fact we had to walk through the basement to get from the lobby to our room on the other side of the hotel. Check in was easy and staff very friendly. Our room was comfortable. Even though there were 4 of us and we had a lot of luggage given we were travelling with 2 small children, we did not feel too cramped and it was useful having a small dressing table just outside the bathroom. Our room looked over O'Farrell St and we did get a bit of street noise, including music and singing from the buskers until about 11pm to 12am but it did not really bother us and our children were able to sleep through it. Our room was just outside the lift though and they were noisy. But again we were not too bothered by it but be aware of it if you a light sleeper and noise sensitive. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom small but adequate. Our coffee maker was not working but was replaced very promptly with a new one. Our room missed being serviced on one day we stayed but clean towels were delivered to us quickly once we called for them. We also got a letter of apology from John Handlery regarding this in response to a feedback form we completed. With our 1 year old we needed to get boiled water and to be able to heat up food from time to time and the staff were very accommodating about that. We were able to access the staffroom to use the microwave. We did not find the concierge very friendly or approachable but the bell hops were very helpful and accommodating. We intended to, but did not get around to trying out the Daily Grill but there are lots of cafes and restaurants close by to try and many at reasonable prices. For breakfast Loris Diner is a good choice (we went back a few times) as is Cafe Mason. Both are just around the corner from the hotel. We had breakfast at Lefty O'Doulls one day but would not back. Food was below average compared to what else was nearby and service was not great. We tried to get into Dotties True Blue Cafe on Jones St given great reviews it got on TripAdvisor but there was a long line outside so we did not wait as we had to 2 children who were very hungry at that stage. We did a lot of walking and our 5 year old managed to keep up pretty well. If you are travelling with kids, Zeum and the Exploratorium are a must. Zeum is in walking distance (about 15 mins) and the Exploratorium accessible by bus. We went to the Aquarium which was good but not really that big and to be honest, if you have been to Kelly Tarlton's in Auckland, the Sydney Aquarium or the Aquarium in Vancouver, you won't really miss anything by giving the Pier 39 Aquarium a miss. You may want to go in any event though if you have kids as they do have some touching pools where you can touch starfish and some fish. We bought the 7 day City Pass which was very handy, and definitely worthwhile if you intend to hop on and off the cable car as otherwise the one ride or daily passes are relatively expensive. The cable car turning area at Powell and Market Streets always seemed to be busy with long lines. It seemed less of a wait at the cable car turning area at the end of the Powell Hyde line. Catch the cable car to the top of Lombard St - it stops literally right at the top where pretty gardens are - rather than approach from the bottom as walking down is definitely easier than walking up! It's easy to catch the cable car back to the city from the bottom of the street. Book your Alcatraz tickets at least a couple of days in advance even in the low season. It was not peak season when we went but we still had to wait for a couple of days before there were available spaces. We did a Wok Wizz walking tour of Chinatown - our guide was very informative and gave us lots of good tips of places to go for people wanting to purchase or see particular things. The tour included a stop at the fortune cookie factory on Ross Street (I think) where we could see how the cookies were made, sample them and of course buy. It was USD5 for a big bag. Very yummy. If you are heading to Chinatown and looking for the more authentic stores, ie the ones where the locals buy their fresh fruit and vegetables and groceries etc, head to Stockton St and Jackson St. Grant St, the street with the Chinatown gate is more for tourists. Cheap T-shirts galore - about USD2 or 3 each. Ghiradelli Square and Hyde St Pier is a good place to spend a relaxing morning or afternoon, especially if you are interested in historic ships and maritime matters. It is also where the Ghiradelli chocolate factory and shops are. Although we had 7 days in SFO, we took things reasonably slowly since we were travelling with kids, but we could probably have easily spent another few days, or even a week, to see some of the other things we didn't get to! One other thing to be aware of is that it is pretty cool in SFO, apparently at any time of the year. Even though it was mid Spring when we went, we found it at times cooler than it was back in Auckland (where it was mid Autumn). Layers are definitely recommended and I would make sure you have a fleece or similar, especially for the kids if you are going to be down near hthe pier/wharf areas. Having said that, if you forget to pack them, there are plenty of places to buy them at relatively cheap prices. For non-Americans and people who have not been to the States before, it might be useful to know that pharmacies like Walgreens, which can be found all over central city, sell almost anything that you would want from a supermarket at reasonable prices so a good place to go to stock up on bottled water, snacks and the like.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montana", "Title": "\u201cGreat overall hotel\u201d", "Author": "mtoutdoorsman", "ReviewID": "UR16740055", "Content": "This hotel is a classy older property taken very good care of and very clean.

Our room was not ready but the hotel staff checked our luggage while we went to eat at a local restaurant across the street, Max's. I had one of the best corn beef & pastrami sandwiches by the way! We went back to the hotel around 3:45 and our room was ready and the bellman brought our luggage up about 5 minutes later. It was worth the wait though! We got an amazing view of the city from our 8th floor room in the club wing. If you have a choice, definitely stay in a club room, they are nicer, roomier and have better views. We only paid $189.99 per night for 2 queen beds. We did have a fridge, 19 inch TV (but who goes to San Fran to watch TV anyway?), a nice bathroom, large closet, desk and a super nice vanity area for me to do my makeup (came with a 3 way lighted mirror as well). The toiletries provided were of moderate value including shampoo, conditioner, lotion, a shower cap and 2 soaps (per day). Towels were ample in the bathroom as well, we were provided 4 large towels, 4 hand towels and 2 face towels. The most surprising part was the bed and that it was actually comfortable. I very rarely have slept in a hotel bed that didn\u2019t have springs popping up, lumpy parts and sunken middle areas. I slept fairly well, even with the street noise, which wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it would be. Our window looking down onto the street had a sliding door, which made the room more comfortable with fresh air. The hotel is located on the edge of Union Square and in walking distance to the trolley stop at Union Square, which is about 2 blocks away. The Moscone Convention Center is about 4-5 blocks away and very easy to get to. Take the trolley to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, Chinatown and Pier 39. I am definitely staying at the Handlery the next time we come to SF. You can\u2019t beat a 2 Queen room for under 200.00 in the city. Even the Motel 6 in the Tenderloin district was 125.00 a night. The concierge was very helpful as was the hotel staff. We always had a taxi waiting and they even provided us a shipping box to ship all of our souvenir\u2019s back. We didn\u2019t try the restaurant at the hotel but I can recommend an amazing breakfast/brunch place. Dottie\u2019s True Blue caf\u00e9 is about 4 blocks away on Jones, in between Geary & O\u2019Farrell. It\u2019s a tiny caf\u00e9 with room for about 20 people, including the counter. We went around 10am on a Monday morning and waited for about 30 minutes to get a table, but it was completely worth it! I had the chorizo, cheddar & egg scramble with fresh salsa and tortilla\u2019s and their famous ginger-cinnamon pancakes (which they are known for). I was not unhappy with 1 bite of food. We went again on Friday morning around 8am and we only had to wait for 5 minutes for a table. So definitely check this place out because I can\u2019t wait to go back!

It was charming and old-fashioned with lots of atmosphere. The price was fantastic for the location. Handlery is located 1/2 a block from Union Square in a touristy but charming neighborhood. Walking into the bustling lobby was like hopping into a time machine. Check in was easy, I have no complaints about the service. I ended up extending my stay and my key card was accidentally turned off but the front desk fixed the problem promptly. I did notice that sometimes there would only be 1 or 2 harried staff at the front desk during off-peak hours which meant waiting for a couple minutes while they juggled phone calls. My one complaint was that although they offer room service for breakfast, the menu wasn't easy to find and the housekeeper kept forgetting to leave it in my room. As for my room, it was smaller than a typical chain, but larger than most similarly priced European hotels (that Handlery claims to emulate). Unlike many large chains where two queen sized beds are the norm, it seemed like at Handlery you get what you pay for. I asked for a room for one person, and it was plenty roomy for me but I wouldn't have wanted to fit more than two people in there. The bed was a smallish double with very nice linens. The closet strangely, was enormous-larger than the bathroom (which was comfy for one but on the small side for two). There was a small desk and chair in the corner but I just worked on the bed.

The hotel has a very old school appeal, no flashy hallways but just nicely carpeted hall ways with nice wooden doors. The rooms are that way aswell.

As other reviews say, the location is good for the downtown shopping, getting to galleries and other spots (some may find the location too 'urban', with lots of homeless milling around, but we're from London so we're used to it!). However, we found the hotel to be only dissapointment amongst anumber of good hotels (at varying price levels) that we stayed in on our trip. Really it comes down to variable service and the hotel being in need of modernisation face lift. When we first checked in, we had polite but hardly friendly service. The initial room they showed us was dark (with only small window onto a dark courtyard) and next to the escalators so we asked to have another room. The next room, which we ended up taking, was small, with not much space beyond the bed, had a low ceiling and faced out onto the street. But it was clean so we took it. However, when we went down later to get the door key changed to the new room we found the man on the front desk very rude and treated us very suspiciously before changing things over. Checking out was hardly better. We decided to leave a night early (despite having paid in advanced for all nights of our stay via expedia) and to head up to Marin County to stay a night with friends up there (which seemed a much better proposition). Again cool service on the front desk and they tried to charge us an extra day for the extortionate $42 for parking. Finally they then lost our bags for 20 minutes when got to the garage to pick up the car. Anyway, as other reviews alude, the Handlery has some period character, and that may be true, but its desperately in need of modernising inside the rooms and in the public areas. We also found the corridors on our floor to be very dark and dare I say a bit smelly. However, on the upside, the price was good, hence why the rating isn't the pits.

Just really really disappointing\u201d", "Author": "jessieleigh", "ReviewID": "UR5981559", "Content": "As I said, where to start? My husband and I spent a month travelling around California in September and early October. San Francisco was one of our early stops. Supposedly it was to be the highlight at the end of a relaxing 10 day trip up the PCH before we headed off to Lake Tahoe and then Yosemite and Death Valley. Figuring we'd be exhausted after moving on every 2 days we booked the Handlery for 4 days. I've visited San Francisco twice before - but the most recent time was 7 yrs ago. And BOY has the city changed! When booking a hotel I avoided Fishermans Wharf area because it was a real dive the last time I was in the city. Instead, I remembered how central and relatively nice Union Sq was. I read trip advisor reviews and the Handlery seemed to be a good option at the time - plus I managed to get a park and pay deal, which when parking is around $40 a day is a big saving across 4 days. Clearly 7 years is a very very long time. I found the city reversed! Sure Fishermans Wharf is now a not very authentic tourist area but compared to Unions Sq it seemed slightly more pleasant - and generally the hotels were a good deal cheaper. Unions Sq was wall to wall beggars - literally one every 10 feet on the sidewalks and had an overriding stench of urine. I work in London, UK so I'm not exactly immune to city life but this has to be the worst case of vagrancy in any city I have ever visited - and the San Francisco I knew 7-10 yrs ago was nothing like this. Now, I have no idea if this is a real problem, although some guide books advised that the beggars ship themselves in from the suburbs and this is their job. I have no idea but the city needs to do something - both to clear up the city and to help those in need. Anyway, as for the Handlery. Well, the staff were mostly nice although not very helpful - except the guy who worked on the front door, i think he was called a \"loss prevention officer\"! He was really great - the only employee in the hotel with an ounce of initiative. He seemed to continually keep an eye out for people who were needing attention and then just help them even though it was clearly not his job. For example, one day the bellhops desk was completely unattended yet he came over, asked us the problem - which was just that we wanted to drop off some laundry (another rant by the way - $4.50 for a pair of underwear? I don't think so!) and off he went with our laundry and came back a minute later with the receipt. I really wish I remembered his name because somebody should give the guy a raise. The concierge on the other hand should be given a talking to - useless and rude. The first room we were given on the 7th floor was tiny, dark and right by the lift shaft - a bit like a cell. I immediately went to the front desk and to their credit they did find us another room on the 10th floor which was nicer - although still a disappointment. I don't know why but the rooms just don't live up to their pictures. It's really weird - we just got our photos back and my husband and I have been showing them to people and they're like what's wrong with it - it looks nice. I agree, it does in the pictures but in the flesh - No. The inch of dust on the skirting board didn't help. The bath towels are the size of what in the UK we call hand towels! Also, I'm sorry but someone needs to tell the hotel that they are based in a city - not having drapes or blackout blinds is insane. The only window covering was a wood slat venetian blind which hung away from the window so people across the way - or indeed the workmen working on the exterior of the building could see inside - not great when you want to get dressed. Plus at night the light streaming in is quite disturbing. Oddly, the noise other people have complained about didn't bother me at all - probably because on the 10th floor we were far removed from it. I definitely won't be going back to this hotel and I would actively recommend against it. Frankly, I'm not sure I'll be heading back to San Francisco any time soon either.

The Handlery was one of the few places that indicated that it was likely--no promises--but likely. As suggested, we emailed a day ahead reminding them of the request. When we arrived we asked again and the clerk said, nope, none available. It hadn't been promised but it sure didn't seem like they made any attempt either. We were there a little early and I\u2019d have felt better if he had at least been willing to check to see if a smoking room might be cleaned and readied later\u2014anything\u2014if he\u2019d just acted like he cared at all, but it was just \u201cno\u201d. We might well have ended up choosing the Handlery anyway but a lot of the decision was made because they indicated we could probably get the smoking room and after being there I\u2019m guessing that they have very few available. *Note--on the positive side, smoking was allowed at the pool area, which was just a level down and very near our room so my brother didn't have to go out and huddle in the hotel doorway like so many other people we saw at many of the non-smoking properties. The other issue was with the internet connection. We didn't go to SF to surf the net or to work but we both had a couple loose ends to take care of for work. My brother travels for a living so has to connect from hotels wherever he is, so he knew that the problem was not just his computer or his settings like they implied. Long-story-short, they ran us around for several days before a bellman finally admitted that most people had to take their laptops elsewhere and advised us that there was free wi-fi at nearby Union Square. We never found out if it was a temporary problem or they just don't actually have internet available but if they had been honest from the start we could have made other arrangements. Once again, the staff was extremely pleasant but their lack of honestly caused both a lot of frustration and a few problems. *Tip: For the club rooms, the hotel garage entry on O\u2019Farrell is actually much handier than the hotel\u2019s front door. Just a doorway down from there is a little print shop called Cyber Copy where they have internet access available. The guy has a bunch of computers already set up and online so no bothering with special logins or passwords to get connected. He just scribbles your time on a scrap of paper and you bring it back when you\u2019re done and you can even get pages printed if you need. And he\u2019s cheap, too\u2014I think it was $8 an hour broken down every 15 mins. For people who just need to check their emails occasionally it\u2019s probably a better deal than paying for internet in your room\u2014even if you can get it to work. A note about the noise: I'd seen complaints in this forum about noise at the Handlery and many other hotels night. I thought these must be sensitive folks from quiet towns or 'burbs not used to city sounds. After being there, I got it! It is NOISY at night. A couple evenings, after midnight someone started playing music on the street corner below. Another night a fight broke out and went on and on until the cops showed up with sirens blasting. Complaints about the garbage collections are legit too. I thought people posting that were just nit-picking, but this is one loud-mother operation! For us it usually started around 1AM and went on for about an hour while city workers pick up trash cans left out on the sidewalks--with the perpetual safety-beepers blaring, clanging-banging, and noisy mechanical lifts jamming it into the trucks, working their way block by block. We survived. I was able to tune it out reasonably easily after the first night. Maybe the trick was all the walking we did and climbing up & down those near-vertical streets so we were dead tired by bedtime. But I'd advise anyone who is sound sensitive to pick up a white-noise machine or even just run a loud fan to help tune down the decibels. We were on the 3rd floor but I think it was loud enough that even the higher floors might get their share of the noise. Once again, this isn't an issue with the Handlery any more than any of the other hotels in the area. It's the trade-off to be in a such a great location. Overall, despite the few issues with the staff, we really did enjoy staying at the Handlery and our entire trip. We would definitely stay there again. It would be a great choice for most people unless you are a smoker and you absolutely object to stepping out to smoke or you need to use your computer in the room. Bottom line was that it was very clean and so comfortable after being out exploring the city all day. Not luxury\u2014but it more than met our needs. One last suggestion: Skip the Daily Grill attached to the hotel and eat at the Irish bar next door--forgot the name now. It's not fancy at all but they've got very good comfort food, meat & potatoes, and more. They serve late and are very reasonably priced.

Long, dark hallways (which could be bad or a \"whatever\"). Room service didn't make our bed all the way one day. The pillows were left on the floor. Kind of noisy where we were on the third floor facing Geary Street. 4:30 am on our last day, someone pulled the fire alarm (false alarm)r.

A floor lamp tilting like it was about to fall over at any moment, glaring bare bulbs over the bed with little shades above them that did nothing to cover the bulb.

While the rate was fair enough for a weekend, we have stayed at other comparably priced hotels in the city with much better rooms, cheaper parking, and no \"issues.\" It cost us over $70 to park for two nights, while a (quite charming) hotel we had stayed at before about a block away overlooking Union Square had only charged $25 per night. (The only reason we did not go back to the other one is because it had no availability.) The room was fairly small, which is average for San Francisco. The pillows were reminiscent of bubble pack mailers covered with a pillow case -- rather thin. But the thing that annoyed me the most is that the \"designer\" comforter had a stain on the underneath when we pulled it back to go to sleep. With no way of knowing whether it had been laundered, and being late at night, we just removed the comforter altogether. The next day I specifically left a note on top of the stain asking housekeeping to take care of it. Yet, when we went to bed that night, there it was. They had ignored the request! Again, it was late in the evening, so we just tossed it aside. Sorry, but we don't want to sleep with somebody else's DNA if we can help it, but we're not so cranky to complain to the desk clerk at midnight! When I checked out I notified the front desk and got a rather weak \"sorry about that; they shouldn't have done that\" with no explanation or offer of any consideration. I think that they could have offered to credit us with a portion of our parking or even a minor (10%?) discount on the room.

We have both been to SF many times, and wanted a moderately priced hotel in a good location. I think the Handlery was a perfect choice! Like all the other reviewers mentioned... Location is KEY. Right smack in the middle of union square. It was very convienent to everything; lots of shopping and restaraunts in walking distance. It's definitely a bustling area. When I first saw the candid reviewers photos on here it made me nervous. But our room was one of the newer club rooms. I took several pictures to show everyone that the new club rooms are much nicer and cleaner. Much more modern than some of the other pictures show. So when you book try to ask for a Club Room. Also our room was located thru a different area of the hotel where you had to walk thru a hallway and go up some stairs, then you walk pass the pool area and to an elevator which takes you up to your room. It is not as far as it sounds, but something to consider if you have alot of luggage. Use a bellhop :-) One weird thing about the room was there was no art on any of the walls? Very simple and classic. The room was average size, the bed faced the window/balcony which is a little unusual. But at night you can see the city lights so that was kind of nice too. They do provide a fridge in room which was great, we filled it with bottled water and sodas for the duration of our trip. The balcony was small (but plenty of room for 2 adults) but my husband would go get coffee and a newspaper ever morning and bring it back to the room, sit outside and enjoy! We used the Wi-Fi internet ($10 day). They had an automatic shoe polisher that my husband tried to use but they did not provide any shoe polish in the room. Maybe you have to call downstairs and ask for that? They have a vanity area which is nice for the ladies to get ready in the mornings or before going out. My only complaint would be when the heater/air came on the noise was LOUD. I am not sure if it's because its an older building? Usually we would just run the air or heat until we were happy with the temperature and just shut it off. If you are a light sleeper, I think you may have some problems.

And the hotel is, overall, a very nice, clean, well-maintained, modern place. I'd return (mostly for the prime location), but I'd skip the extra $ for a Club room; ours was average size and its window was directly opposite the window in a building about six feet across an alley, which appeared to be a waiting room or something, so we hardly ever opened the drapes. We didn't get the promised daily newspaper - one of the two \"enhanced amenities\" I was most interested in receiving. And on the first day of our stay, our room had still not been cleaned by 3:00 p.m. Also, it's important to know that the Club-level rooms are actually in a separate building that faces O'Farrell, linked to the main hotel by a stairway and the pool deck. If you have heavy luggage, as I did, you're either at the mercy of the very, very, very persistent bellhops (I despise bellhops) OR you have to carry your suitcase up three short flights of stairs. (I have no idea how they accommodate somebody in a wheelchair who wants a Club room, although since the bellhops are probably not carrying all that luggage up the steps, there must be a SECRET elevator somewhere that only the staff is permitted to use.) This is SO bogus! SO, yes, stay at the Handlery, but don't go for the Club room upgrade. It is simply more trouble than it's worth.

The beds were very comfortable, the room was quiet, and the refrigerator came in handy for sodas and water. We had no complaints whatsoever. Besides the room being so clean, what we appreciated was the massive vanity that is outside the bathroom area. For 3 women sharing a room and trying to get ready for the day at the same time, this was a wonderful surprise! There was a bench to set on and a makeup mirror on the vanity along with the wall mirror that was the length of the vanity. Towels were clean and the soaps/shampoos were nice too. Although the weather was too cool to use the pool, it certainly looked inviting. As was suggested on previous reviews, we chose to eat breakfast next door at Lefty's. The food was good and service was fast. We caught a cable car on Powell Street, which is less than 1 block away. And it was only a short walk to where we could purchase the cable car tickets. If you don't have much luggage, I would suggest taking the BART from the airport to Powell Street (cost for 1 way to Powell Street is $5.15) instead of a taxi ride which is $40 one way! You can get off the BART (about a 25 minute ride from the airport) at the Powell Street exit which is inside the mall. Walk out the front door of the mall and you are on Powell Street facing the site where you purchase tickets for the cable cars. From there it is only a few blocks walk to the hotel. Would probably be inconvenient to take the BART from the airport if you had more than one piece of luggage to pull, but certainly beats the price of a cab.

We were on honeymoon and the hotel left us some nice wine and munchies on our arrival, which was nice after a long haul flight. Hotel is excellent location if you like the hustle/bustle and shops. What let it down was the room- although it had all the facilities, we were in the historic bit facing Geary St and we found the decor a bit dreary and the noise annoying- expecially from street performers at night - it didn't really feel special given we were on honeymoon. Apparently the club rooms are better, so if you can afford this it may be a lot better/quieter. San Francisco is beautiful- especially by Fisherman's Wharf- if we went again we would stay in this area as it has a much more relaxed/holiday feel to it. We went on the Gray line trolley bus tour of the city for 28 dollars, and this was excellent- Presidio and Fort Point are lovely with good views of the Golden Gate bridge. Also had a tour of Muir woods and Sausalito, which was brilliant. Buy a 3 day trolley pass from the concierge. Foodwise- the Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macys is a must- it is always busy but they have a pager system meaning you only have to wait 10/15 mins for a table. Also had an excellent Chinese banquet for 12 dollars at Chef Hung's in Chinatown- go through the gate and it's about 1/2 mile in on a road to the left. The Rainforest cafe at Fisherman's Wharf was good fun for the experience and had huge portions- as does everywhere in the US.

Incidentally we were not the only people to request a room change - we heard of a few requests during our stay.

We found the Daily Grill very inconsistant on quality and service and after 3 days gave up and looked elsewhere.

Dale at the conceirge desk was so gracious to us and answered every question I had no matter how stupid it may have been. Our room was very clean and was very quiet. We faced the pool area. I think there was some kind of convention in town and on one night, there was some loudness by the pool at 11 pm. But it only went on for a few minutes before someone from the hotel put a stop to it. We were impressed. We will be returning in August for the emotional dorm move-in with my daughter and The Handlery is were we will be returning and returning again.", "Date": "June 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Deal\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3535849", "Content": "We stayed there for our Honeymoon in the Club Area - Got a package deal (on their website) which included free parking.

Once we chose San Fran as our destination, planning the honeymoon was easy. But the hotel part was a bit of a challenge. I finally chose the Handlery based on: price, reviews from this site, and the cordial phone exchange I had when I called inquiring about rates. The other hotels (no names mentioned, but they were all in Union Square and were considerably more expensive) were curt and not particularly accommodating on the phone. But the woman I spoke with at the Handlery was straight-shooting, gave me her direct line if I had any questions, and offered a remarkable rate + a room upgrade since were honeymooners. For first-time visitors like my wife and I, the ride from the airport to the hotel was a bit of an eye opener. You go through some rather decrepit areas. But the block where the hotel is (on Geary) is beautiful. Once we found our room (complete with champagne--compliments of the hotel), we were delighted. It wasn't huge, but it was more than enough, plus it had a little balcony and a small changing room adjacent to the bathroom. The bed was large and comfy and the place was SPOTLESS. I was quite relieved, having only seen a handful of lo-res pictures on some website. The concierge was superb, and advised us (after seeing us hailing cabs the first few days) to use San Fran's excellent public transportation. Coming from Philadelphia, we were skeptical (SEPTA, for those who live in or near Philadelphia, is the most expensive public transport in the country). We found the San Fran system to be excellent and very cheap. The concierge also recommended some great (and affordable) restaurants in the area. Lefty O'Doul's was fun, cafeteria-style dining and it's literally right nextdoor to the hotel. We were able to see many sites (Golden Gate bridge, SBC Park, Chinatown, Haight-Ashbury) via a short bus ride from the hotel. The location was very convenient. Room service was prompt and the food was always delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. By and large, our stay was near perfect. I have to mention the two things, just to be fair, that kept me from giving it the full five stars: 1. There was what I like to call \"the kiddie\" factor. I don't like screaming kids, sorry. In fact, I'm lukewarm on kids period. But this place, being a reasonably priced hotel in a neighborhood pretty much devoid of reasonably priced hotels, caters (from what I could see) to families. Literally every night (and early in the morning when these dreadful small creatures arise), we had some kids screaming or stomping in the hallway. This is not really the hotel's fault, but it bears mentioning for those who want a truly quiet getaway. 2. Don't let San Fran natives soft-sell you on the homeless person factor. MANY San Francisco residents scolded me for even being concerned. Well, let me tell you, these people hound you constantly and you can't walk 1/2 block without being asked for change. And some of them get downright belligerent. I realize this is a terribly insensitive thing to say, but it wasn't something we wanted to see on our honeymoon. If we wanted to see (and be able to help) homeless people, we would have gone on some kind of Christian retreat. It really put a damper on what was otherwise a stellar visit. As long as you realize going in that it is URBAN, it is the city, you'll be okay. I think the shock of it made it hard for my wife and I. This is not a criticism of the hotel, just a warning to those unfamiliar with the area. Otherwise, this was a great visit and I would definitely recommend the Handlery--especially to honeymooners.", "Date": "February 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat getaway for an overnight\u201d", "Author": "jayjoans", "ReviewID": "UR3025000", "Content": "My wife and I just BARTed in from the East Bay for a night away from the kids.
