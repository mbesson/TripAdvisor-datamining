Reasonably good and plentiful breakfast. I found the hotel a little hard to find on arrival, I don't really understand the Venetian address system, and the directions are not that clear.

Location - the hotel is located just of the main thoroughfare from the station area (Ferrovia) up towards Cannaregio. It's 10 mins tops walk. It's not hard to find if you use your eyes. There's a sign on the wall when you need to turn off and then the hotel is just there. Although its off a bustling area, our hotel room, on the nearest side to the street was not at all noisy. However, some Italian guests did like the sound of their own voices. Hotel - the lady who runs the place was nice and helpful. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfy. The shower was lovely and powerful and hot. Breakfast offered cereal, bread, croissants, coffee, juice, yoghurt, p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9, honey, chocolate spread. There was a quite balcony on the inner side of the room which was nice for a pre-evening drink before heading out. If you do decide to use the vapporetti (water bus), NO ONE CHECKS TICKETS.
