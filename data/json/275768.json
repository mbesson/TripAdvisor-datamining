It was good to come back and see the whole hotel refurbished, beautiful entrance, very good decor in rooms, in ancient 1800's style, the room i got was on the 5th floor, a double single use, a little on the smallish side ( bit that is normal for Rome hotels) with a nice terrace overlooking Rome's roof line, and with a very large bathroom. The Breakfast room, that last timed was a very small back room suring the works, it is now a very elegant appointed area, with a sumptuous complete buffet, including scrambled eggs and bacon. The service ( an item that took to my attention during my previous stay) , is always courteous, efficient and polite, with Marco and his colleague at the reception counter. The price to quality ratio of this hotel is excellent, and I got a very good rate too being low season. The location of this hotel is perfect, near the famous central Via Veneto and the American Embassy, and in 15 minutes walk you are in Via del Corso or in Piazza di Spagna, and just at 50 meters from the hotel there is a very good restaurant, a French Bistro, where we had an excellent dinner last year. I am attaching some pictures taken during my stay there, showing my room, the 545. I strongly recommend this hotel for both tourists and business travelers.

We had read on trip advisor there was quite a lot of renovation but when we arrived we hardly saw any. I think there were only some small areas left that they were fixing. Room - Our room was very nice and had a lovely large bathroom. Everything was very clean and we also had a large TV. No complaints about the room. Location - A bit of a walk to major sights but really not that bad and was lovely to see things along the way. There was also a restaurant located close by called Il Pomodoro (I think that was the name) and it was very good - I would really recommend going there. Breakfast - Yes was fine, had much worse. Service is a bit slow and sometimes they ran out of cups and plates but eventually they get to you. Breakfast finished at 10 (a little early in my opinion) so maybe that's why they were running out of plates by the time we ate. Service - Have to say this was absolutely terrible and why I will not go back despite a very affordable and nicely refurbished hotel. There was an older man at reception who was unbelievably rude. Seemed as though everything I asked him was a bother and almost like he went out of his way to be unhelpful. I would stand at reception and he would not even look up -I had to ask for his attention before he would help. I am not normally bothered by things like that but he really was rude. There were other people we met in the hotel that also found this man rude as well.

Speaking of pictures. Those that are on this property's website are inviting. They show well-appointed rooms that appear spacious. I was disappointed at the size of the rooms upon check-in; they did not live up to the expansiveness that the website photos indicate. Although meticulously clean and freshly renovated, they are typical European rooms. That is, small and lacking the move-around space that is common in American fare hotels. The bathroom was also newly refurbished, however, the large sink size and its close proximity to the toilet bowl made it very difficult to sit without hitting yourself as you attempt to wiggle through the available space to get to the toilet. Large (or tall) guests will find this particularly difficult and I would recommend anyone who is packing a few extra pounds to avoid this property. I have to say the rooms were clean and free of any musty smell (or that of a recent smoker). Certainly, this room did not violate any of my clean-freak idiosyncrasies. My problems with this property are many. After lengthy conversation with some of the very helpful staff, I learned that a major expansion of the lobby is underway, which should alleviate the following points I would like to share. Of course, until these changes are actually made, I would render this hotel toward the bottom of my future choices, perhaps slightly above that of a pensione. 1. There was only one chair in the lobby, making it impossible to use the cramped quarters as a meeting place for groups traveling together. Similarly, upon check-in, bags clutter what space is available, adding to the claustrophobic feeling. 2. Although the lobby had Wi-Fi capability, the fact there was only one chair on which to sit made it impossible for two people to use their computer at the same time, unless, of course, one of the guests sat on the lobby floor. 3. The rooms did not have internet access. (Perhaps the lobby expansion will include a few computers that the guests could \"rent\" on an hourly basis.) 4. The entrance to the hotel was at street level, however, you had to traverse two flights of steps (approx 12 in number) with your bags to get to the check-in desk. At our arrival time, there was no hotel staff available to assist guests in moving their luggage, which meant we all had to carry our baggage to the rooms. 5. Since we were traveling as a group, we were given our own \"floor\" of rooms - the 6th floor, to be exact. The very small elevator only stops to the 5th floor. So, to get our bags to our rooms, we had to traverse another series of steps. 6. The breakfast room was ample for the amount of guests this property accomodates, however, it is only accessible via the elevator, as it is located on the \"ground-level\" of the hotel. A stairway leading to the breakfast room would improve access, as well as an emergency exit. 7. The elevator was noisy. Even though the elevator did not stop on our floor, it could still be heard quite loudly, especially at night.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cShafty, misleading, & unpleasant service.\u201d", "Author": "DonatingDonkey", "ReviewID": "UR59862078", "Content": "Overall the hotel, service, breakfast, location etc... was quite good and warrants a strong rating. ie 8/10 (Very good).

My parents (around 70 years old) only can speak a little English, no Italien. At check-in they did the payment in cash, but they did not get a receipt or something. I called the hotel from Germany, this man said only at check-out they can get a bill. But I asked whithout any receipt how my parents can prove if they've already paid . So he finally gave them a receipt. During the phone talk, he did not have a bit patience, saying \"I have just told you, you did not listen\". Well, even if I did not listen or understand, maybe he can repeat once instead of criticising me. After they came back from Italy 7 days later, I asked them if they have an bill, no, they did not get. I called the hotel again. This man said on the phone: \"I gave it to them personally, they are lying\" and hang up the phone. I was so shocked how he can judge somebody lying before he knew the truth. On the other hand, one should never talk like this to the customer! I called again to tell they did not get, he said he gave it the first day. I said that's just a receipt with handwriting, not bill. He said, they don't provide computer printed bill, only handwriting receipt. Then he told me he is fed up of my invoice problem. I'm really horrified how far he can go. He hang up the phone and did not pick it up anymore when I tried to call. Later I manage to go through the line and wanted to talk to his manager, he just hang up. That's a horrible experience. One can really cry if he/she faces such service person. In conclusion: 1, the person doesn't have an idea what service is. He can criticise or abuse customer as he likes. Very bad manner, no patience, bad and short temper. He is definitely not qualified to work at the front desk. 2, this hotel is trying to evade tax, otherwise one cannot understand why they don't give a bill.

On arrival we were greeted very nicely and given the keys to our rooms on the same floor as the reception. I was slightly alarmed at the state of the door to our room as I couldnt imagine why a hotel would renovate all the rooms but not change the doors. Anyway, my horror was to get worse on entry. The room was disgusting to say the least. It was smelly, damp, 1960's bed covers, mouldy walls, no plugs, safe in a trolley on wheels....etc etc ,it goes on. My husband was very unimpressed and when we got back from dinner nearby and he really couldnt have a bath as there was no plug, I decided to have a little look upstairs. To my utter amazement it was like walking from a nightmare into a princess dream castle. The walls, corridoors and hotel room doors were renovated to a very impressive standard and looked 5 star. I could not believe we had been given what was obviously the last of the \"rubbish\" rooms downstairs. I dragged my husband to have a look and he was as shocked as me. He stomped off to reception and asked for us and our friends to be moved. Amazingly the receptionist wasnt put out at all, as if this must happen all the time. He said it was too late that night but to speak to the manager in the morning. We did that and he immediately said he would move us up to the superior rooms that day. As good as his word, when we got back that night we were upstairs and the difference was absolutely unbelievable. The rooms were fantastic. Not overly large but incredibly clean, comfortable, light, airy. They were the sort of hotel room I would seek to stay in. We had two very enjoyable nights there. The downstairs area/reception and breakfast room I understand are the next phase to be done. Once this has been completed this hotel will be hard to beat. Just make sure you get a new refurbished room otherwise you will be so disappointed you booked this hotel. Now having stayed there initially in a bad \"old\" room, I can understand why some reviews of this hotel are so awful. It is a real shame because these negative opinions are obviously only coming from the guests they are placing in the old rooms.

Room 545 had a large closet , and a great balcony(no chairs). The only complaint we had with the hotel was that the air conditioner was not on. they don't put it on until mid june. huh? Room was a little hot, had to keep the balcony door open all night. We had gone to Rome for a wedding and a little sight seeing. all in all a great time", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay\u201d", "Author": "totalTrondheim", "ReviewID": "UR27710603", "Content": "I've read many reviews of this hotel before we headed for Rome. The hotel was prepaid, so there was impossible to change. A certain amount of the reviews was VERY bad, and we were excited when we wntered the hotel 10 pm at March 29th. But alas - everything was just perfect: a nice room (newly renovated) with a comfortable bed, a very clean and modern bathroom, and a safe in the closet. The location was also perfect, just some few minutes form hte Borghese Park and Museum. Even if it was in the center of the town, the nights were very quiet, and there were lots of restaurants in all prce ranges in the neighboorhood. It's beyond our imagination that this hotel was a bad one. We stayed 6 days in Ancona (Eastern Italy, Adriatic coast), and there we paid the same price, but in Ancona we stayed far from the center, it was a motel, and it was a really low budget accomodation without a low budget price! The room we stayed in, looked just like the photos on the internet site. The staff was mainly friendly and helpful. The breakfast assortment wasn't very plentiful, but OK. Daytime we heard the renovation of the 2nd and 3rd floors, but when you are in Rome, you don't stay in your hotel room at daytime?? So, we will certainly stay in this hotel next time we are in Rome, and will recommend this to others!", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey USA", "Title": "\u201cExtremely comfortable, ideally located, excellent service and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "orswelle", "ReviewID": "UR25316479", "Content": "The place was really a pleasant surprise and can't say enough good things about it. Maybe the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Made you feel right at home with really laid-back but at the same time professional staff. Really friendly people. The location was perfect because although it was totally right in the downtown, it wasn't an area loaded with tourists so we felt like we're really a part of the city's life instead of just tourists. It's elegance lent itself very well also to being romantic enough for a couple like us. All this with reasonable prices too. When going back to Rome won't even consider another hotel. Would recommend it to anyone.

Our room was on an incredibly busy street so the noise level all night kept us awake (we equated it with a Boeing 747 driving up and down the street.) Night #2 - Back at Principessa in the a.m. with our bags. We were told our room was not ready, but go enjoy our day and they would put the bags in our room for our return in the evening. We got back to the hotel about 10:00 p.m. only to find our bags still in the lobby. There was no one to help us with our bags - not for us, but for the other couple we were traveling with - aged 70 years old. Our room was so small we had to move the portable heater out in order to put our bags inside the room. The bed was two single beds pushed together with a large sheet to hold them together. The furnishing were so old that the veneer was peeling off the furniture. The bath as clean but with rust stains on the sink, etc. They promised to move us for night #3 to a newly remodeled room. Night #3. The remodeled room was GORGEOUS. So, after two sleepness nights we were looking forward to a great night's sleep in this really lovely room. NOT. The bed was stone hard - not an ounce of give to the mattress at all. In fairness, it's tough to find a hotel in Rome for less than $200/night. I would say that if by now all the rooms have been remodeled, then take a chance - if you don't mind sleeping on a slab!", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Principessa Isabella", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d275768-Reviews-Hotel_Principessa_Isabella-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$106 - $298*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Sardegna 149</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "275768", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/59/76/c8/room.jpg"}}
