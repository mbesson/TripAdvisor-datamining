{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The Charm Is Fading Having stayed at the Pension Aller over 10 years ago, I booked another stay with Frau Kraus for a family of 3.Frau Kraus is charming as ever, but somehow forgot/lost our reservation even though she remembered the name. We ended up split between two rooms as she had placed single people in the bigger rooms capable of sleeping 3. Why would you even do that in the first place?The pension itself has not changed at all in the past ten years. Unfortunately this meant that exhaust filters in the 2 bathrooms we had were both completely clogged, mildew was growing on the shower tiles in both rooms, and exterior paint was peeling off the windows.No TV, no elevator up to the 3rd floor location only a single dial phone for all rooms to share, and of course no AC means that this pension is no longer the charming bargain it once was. We only saved a modest 30 euros over a similar quality hotel near the train station.I have to recommend looking elsewhere unless the 30 euros is important enough for you to endure the faults.", "Date": "Jun 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR217625390", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Thaumaturge"}, {"Content": "One of the best parts of our trip to Frankfurt We booked online based on a very positive review we had heard. We had no problem getting there from the airport, our cab driver had already been there with other guests. Upon arrival and climbing several flight of stairs we were met by the owner, a charming older lady who seemed truly delighted to me us. She led us to another building, again up several flghts of stairs, and into our huge room.Although we had to share the bathroom with one other guest ther was never any problems and the communal kitchen was fantastic. As we were on our way back from India and our 4 year old son was not sleeping due to the jet-lag, we expected that there might be some complaints about the racket he made. Again there was no problem. there other guest were respectful of the family and actually seemed to enjoy the kids. It was truly family friendly.Breakfast in the morning with Frau Krauswas also great. Our son loved it.It's not a hotel, so don't expect that level of service. But its a great place to stay when in Frankfurt. It feels like home and it within a walk to downtown and the train station.", "Date": "Apr 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR430709011", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "greg3"}, {"Content": "clean and friendly I stayed at Pension Aller with my daughter for one might in March 2006. Excellent value for money, clean ,friendly and in a great position. If you are looking for for simple but comfortable accommodation with a basic breakfast then this is the place for you.
