We ordered breakfast for 7:30 and on the first morning it arrived at 7:50 (not a problem) but the second day it still hadn't arrived by 8:30 so we gave up and headed out for the day. We met the owner on the terrace, who was very apologetic, but the damage had already been done. One of the reasons I chose this hotel was the promise of free wifi but it wasn't working during our stay and the staff weren't especially helpful in getting it fixed or providing an alternative. I was counting on wifi access to get information on sights and restaurants so was frustrated when it wasn't available. There was a nespresso machine in the room, as advertised, but only four capsules were provided and they were not replenished. The hotel doesn't have a bar or restaurant so we had to go out for coffee. The front door of the hotel is locked and staff refused to provide us with an additional key. This meant that if we didn't go back to the hotel together I had to call my partner to be let into the hotel (up/down 3 flights of stairs). I was surprised that there was no \"information booklet\" in the room. I though the previous guest must have taken it but when I asked the staff they said that they don't provide such information. Given that there is no reception desk I would have appreciated information on how to contact the staff if needed. These are all relatively minor problems but the number of small problems certainly detracted from our stay. The staff were all friendly and the room very comfortable but for EUR240 per night I don't expect so many small problems. One of the staff (unfortunately I've forgotten her name but think it was Keti) was extremely helpful and gave us some excellent restaurant recommendations. She also appreciated the problems with the lack of wifi whereas the other staff just shrugged their shoulders and hoped I would go away.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hospitality\u201d", "Author": "mom_of_s_n_y", "ReviewID": "UR126127277", "Content": "We spent 3 nights at the Moses Fountain Guest House, March 2012. We stayed at the \"Swanky Cardinal\" - the red room. A spacious beautifully designed room with a unique bathroom and a tiny terrace overlooking the busy junction below. The room is nice and lit, perfectly equipped, warm and pleasant. There's a free minibar they stock with light drinks and an espresso machine in the room. Breakfast was never the same in the 3 days we stayed there - but it always included a small bowl of fruit salad, another one of vegetables (no dressing, on the 3rd day we got olive oil), great cappuccino, toasts, croissants, and a bag with biscuits and crackers to take with us along the way. The shower is really big and uniquely designed. The hosts take big pride of it. As for the location: The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Termini station, which allows you to take the train to and from the airport instead of a taxi. There's a 2 minute walk from the hotel to the Republica metro station (the line goes to the Vatican). It's about 10 minutes to the Piazza Barberini, 15-20 minutes walk from the hotel to the Spanish Steps and about the same distance to the Piazza Venezia. Slightly longer walk to the Colosseum. During the day the area around the hotel is very busy. At night it's a lot quieter which makes it a good place to rest. However, if you're looking to stay in the middle of everything with a variety of restaurants right below - this is not it. We loved our stay at the Moses Fountain and may consider staying there again. But if you are not a walker - take into consideration there's a climb up the stairs to your room (no lift) and that at the end of a Rome walking day the last 10 minutes walk to the hotel through a relatively dormant area could be really exhausting.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffern, New York", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Hotel Ever\u201d", "Author": "MitchellKW", "ReviewID": "UR125893683", "Content": "My colleague and I have been traveling around the world practically every week for the last six months.

The rooms were perfectly appointed with dramatic ceilings. The fridge was stocked with a nice variety of free beverages. The rooms were spotless.

There was a roomy safe for valuables and closets with a perfect amount of room for suits and dresses along with an ironing board. The breakfast was beautiful and the freshly squeezed blood orange juice was an all time favorite. This hotel is flawless as well as reasonably priced. We cannot say more positive things about any hotel anywhere in the world. The hotel is perfectly well situated. It is a 5 minute walk to the Metro and a 10 minute walk to the train station.

There is no 4.5 which would be adequate. We rounded to five because of Emma, who always did more and was so kind. First of all, this is not a regular hotel. This is quite clear in the reviews. First, the entrance is small. We didn\u2019t have problems finding it because of pictures the hotel sent at the time of the reservation and reading other guests\u2019 experience here. We arrived late after a delay in our airplane. So it was around nine when we got there. You ring and then someone opens the door for you, but the first you see are steps. They should beware about the steps in their webpage. Something strong people can manage easily, but I imagine some people didn\u2019t enjoy them. At night there was a very kind young woman (whose name I can\u2019t remember) and spoke very good English and Italian. She was by herself so we helped her carry our luggage (this was the time I thought about knowing of the stairs beforehand). We wished there was a front desk with someone available 24 hours. You can call the Richmond hotel, but we never did that. We felt that as they were far away was only for emergencies. Also, we didn\u2019t feel it as a hotel but as a guesthouse. Next in the morning we met Andrea, who help us explaining and giving us some recommendations which didn\u2019t work that well. But he didn\u2019t not help us to reserve. I suggest solving their weak link by having a reception/concierge who not only recommend buy actually help you out to solve some things and reserve different options (private tours vs. going to the bus company across the street). The location is very adequate, close to Termini train station, and Via Veneto is just some minutes away walking. They recommend very good restaurants too. We had two rooms with them. The small one (medium category) was large enough, beautifully decorated, nice marble bathroom with excellent shower. It is an equivalent to a high-end four star hotel. The other was a deluxe room, which is the size of a five hotel room. Even without a tub, the bathroom was outstanding, with an incredible huge shower (with good pressure) and steam. The ETRO toiletries are a nice touch. You\u2019ll find too sleepers and bathrobes. The beds are adequate with customized sheets. Although the web page describes massive breakfast, you get a continental one. Believe me, you won\u2019t go hungry. They serve a lot of bread, fresh and packed cheese, marmalade, cappuccino, orange juice, cookies, pastries and other goodies. Fresher jam and bread would make it perfect. We enjoyed it a lot. Now, I\u2019ll talk about Emma. She was really amazing. Did a lot for us, like checking if we were going somewhere we would find what we needed. Also se was really friendly and we felt how she enjoyed helping us. A good vibe you don\u2019t get always in a top notch five star hotel. That made every other issue minor. I would stay again happily. What I loved, was the value. Although it is not cheap, is reasonable priced and value for what you get there. Once there, you don\u2019t feel bad any moment because all is included.

Besides, it's very close to some famous points, like the Trevi Fountain (walk of 10 minutes), Spanish Steps. A calm 5 minute walk to Termini Station. Thanks to this great location, we didn't have to take any taxis in the whole trip, what resulted on an enormous economy to us - of money and time, once the traffic is hard. Everything can be easily achieved on foot or by bus or metro. We stayed on the blue room and it was great: large, had a quiet and powerful air conditioning, frigobar included (it was very nice to have a cold Coke when we arrived after walking hours on that hot hot hot weather), big bathroom, very clean.

And based on the email conversations, we knew that Moses Fountain was the right place for us.

The staff speaks English wonderfully and the service they provide is better than any 5 star hotel I have ever stayed in. They provide you with a free mini bar that is restocked daily and even went so far as to pour the drink for us when we arrived! The breakfast was fabulous and delivered to our room. This hotel is family run and you can tell--its like staying as a guest with a dear friend--anything you need or want, they are able to provide. In addition to calling the airport for us continually (and providing us updates on the status of the lost luggage), they assisted in recharging our Italian cell phone with money so we could make calls and they negotiated a better rate on the transfer when we eventually had to go to to the airport to retrieve the lost luggage. And even further, while we were waiting for our transfer, they brought us more drinks and told us to relax until they called us to go downstairs.

We were pretty worn out after an overnight train ride, but we walked up to the terrace and were greeted by the ever-gracious Emma. She sat down with us, gave us a map, talked us through the sites, gave us tips on booking tickets and made us feel quite welcome. We were also given the code for the free wi-fi right away. Our room wasn't ready yet (as we knew we were early - about 10:30 am), but they did carry our luggage up the stairs and were able to store it for us while we went out for the day. We didn't miss having a check-in desk one bit - if I could give them more than 5 stars for service, I would. One other thing to note is that everyone in the hotel does speak English very well - we could've gotten by on my Italian, but were much more comfortable knowing everyone spoke English. We loved our room - it was the green room and had plenty of space for a traveling couple accumulating gifts and souvenirs at the end of our European vacation. The room had wood floors, soft white comforters and a large, modern bathroom. The Tv had so many stations it was dizzying. it was great that wifi and breakfast were included - it made it seem like a good value. the breakfast was substantial and they offered cappucinos every day. in the evening, they set out wine and snacks on the patio. They also refilled the mini bar every day (for free). Jeanne and Emma were so helpful to us whenever we needed anything - the service was so amazing. We had a painfully early flight and they even arranged to have the cab company call 15 minutes before they arrived, so I wouldn't be worried/stressed. The experience felt like we were staying as a guests in someone's home - they cleaned the room every day and also did a turn-down service in the evening. There are no \"do not disturb\" signs, so if you find these services intrusive, you might be better off at a larger hotel. The one slight drawback is that the room was kept at a warm temperature which we couldn't figure out how to adjust, so we just kept the windows open, which did result in some street noise and mosquitoes. The neighborhood was in good distance of the major sites in room - either walking or a short metro ride away. The neighborhood around the hotel felt safe at night due to the numerous government agencies and was a good place to find local places to eat (less touristy and less expensive).

The hotel was well located and easy to walk from most areas. Sometimes with the kids we'd cab it home from the further locations (vatican, Jewish Quarter). I really wanted a hotel with a personal touch and was not disappointed. We stayed in the \"mini-apartment\" for our family of four. The room was perfect and the kids liked the movie chanels in english as well as the large Japanese tub. There is a kitchenette, as well as multiple closets, master bedroom and a living room with a double pull out bed (which was perfect for the kids). Each morning we had breakfast on their deck overlooking the Ministry of Agriculture building. It's the personal touch that brought me here and would bring us back. Our arrival was at 9:30 pm; and still Andrea, the owner, met us at the door, showed us around the room and then personally walked us to that \"mom and pop\" restaurant we all crave when we get to a foreign country. Infact, that is how our 5 days transpired; each day sitting in the morning sun, sipping our cappucino and discussing with the owners (either Andrea or his sister Emmanuela) where to go, where to eat and how best to arrange the day. This is how I envisioned the trip and eventhough I had both Fodors and Frommers 2011 editions, I knew the advice of locals is invaluable. You wont go wrong with this choice! Whether it was booking a spa day for my wife at Emmanuela's favorite spa or getting us to the train station (Andrea was heading that way so he helped pull our luggage all the way and put us on the correct track for Florence), this is the kind of hotel we are always looking for.

We hadn't been to Rome before and after a tiring journey and walk from the main railway station we found the hotel pretty easily. It helped that I knew the door was round to the left of the stunning Moses Fountain. In future we would take a taxi which is a fixed price of 40 EUR from the airport (which we did on the return journey). We were quickly greeted and welcomed to our room by the co-owner. After checking the TV worked and a comprehensive run through of all the facilities we got a personal set of recommendations for places to eat and go to see. We had three days in Rome and three weeks wouldn't be enough! The room was magnificent - called Swanky Cardinal it had bright red walls and stylish contemporary furnishings. A real boutique hotel with unique features like a tiny little window overlooking the square and a huge full length window overlooking the Santa Maria della Vittoria church (the one in Dan Brown's Angel and Demons). This window had a cool motorised blind with a remote control and a small balcony to overlook the square and down the road to the Quirinale and presidential palace. The bed was very comfortable, good storage and there was a programmable room safe and a free Nespresso coffee machine and small mini bar. There was also an LCD TV with Sky. The best bit was the bathroom - a feature of any hotel built into a fountain! We had a huge rain shower over a sunken bath tub all set into a little tower. Overhead there were coloured LED lights and it really was amazing. I hadn't mentioned this feature to my wife who was rather blown away! The bath took a while to fill though as it was so large. Breakfasts were served on the terrace or in the room. We rang 10 minutes before we were ready and then it all arrived easily. A lovely continental spread which I don't normally eat much from but it was so tasty we cleared it. The cake was especially nice. We had no issues getting it served where we wanted. The staff were always friendly and although not all had fluent English we had no issues. The owners were fantastically helpful. We booked Vatican tickets on-line and they printed them and delivered to our room. Restaurant recommendations etc were good and very helpful. You also couldn't hear the fountain at all!! All in all a brilliant place to stay - very cool to stay in a fountain, especially in Rome.

It is fare to say that the Moses Fountain is more a boutique B&B rather than a hotel. While you may miss certain amenities such as reception and bar you get a far friendlier and intimate service. The owner also provided us with several contact numbers in the event that we had any problems, and we found that there was a maid on the premises most of the time anyway. We found the hotel by looking through trip advisor. We wanted something different and special and were certainly not disappointed. The fact the hotel is part of a monument really added to the experience. There are a number of steps to climb, however we did not find this to be an issue. Even my mother who has just finished chemo treatment managed without too much difficulty.

We came in at night and the driver had called ahead to get directions so they were expecting us. A very nice lady greeted us at the door and helped us carry our luggage up. She gave us a tour of our room. Then the owner came and explained where we were and how everything worked and recommended a great restaurant for us. He let us know that he was there for us should we need anything at all. It was a wonderful welcome! The next morning we had an amazing breakfast which included and assortment of breads and fruit with some cheese and coffee and fresh squeezed juice. Also with the breakfast was a few cookies/crackers that we took with us to snack on later! It also had a mini bar with complimentary beverages. I thought it was delicious! It was brought right up to our room. Our room was very spacious with a king sized bed and very clean. The bathroom was great! It had double sinks and an amazing shower with an option of using it as a steam room. The location is great. It's within walking distance of fountains and basilicas which are absolutely amazing. In fact, right next door to the hotel is a basilica. You must go in there. It's breath taking! The train station is just a short walk as well.

I still don't know which one worked, but a voice came on the intercom and called us by name and let us in. The hotel has no reception area and no kitchen (just a small pantry from which a generous breakfast is produced and brought to your room), and after hours there is no one there to let you in, so you need to keep your key card with you at all times so you can buzz yourself in to that big door. There is a direct phone line to the concierge at the Richmond Hotel, and we used that several times with good results. Behind the big wooden door is a delightful, quiet, comfortable, reasonably priced hotel, and the location can't be beat - it's a 5-10 minute walk from Termini train station and very close to several sites with great Baroque art - 4 churches, Palazzo Barberini, etc. The hotel also has free WiFi.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cDont trust the ratings and reviews at tripadvisor !!!\u201d", "Author": "P24-Traveller", "ReviewID": "UR100057949", "Content": "I have booked this hotel because of the excellent reviews it has received, but it its is not worth the money.

(nice little touches like a nightlight in the lower walkway from the bed to bathroom). It was a very comfortable room, the bed was very comfy and I felt quite at home there. The bathroom was luxurious and fantastic with really nice toiletries. The owners were both also very friendly and Emanuella took the time to provide us with lots of information about Rome and give us some guidance on things to see/places to eat etc which was really appreciated. It was therefore a shame that although the attention to detail was high in the set up of the room, that the service seemed to lack the same quality. For example; we were advised that we could call for breakfast in the morning and any request we had at any time would be welcomed. However when my partner called for breakfast in the morning and started to ask for breakfast with juice etc, he was met with the curt response that 'you will have the normal breakfast' now we were not about to ask for anything outlandish, but to be met with this sort of response is not good customer service as I would expect to have. Also we found the snacks in the mini bar were not replenished for the entirety of our stay (the drinks were; maybe the snacks were a one off, but when it is stated the mini bar is replenished twice a day, my understanding of that would be everything in it). One evening we had no milk left in the room, and this may sound like i'm being picky, but after a days sight seeing the last thing you want to do when you've just got comfy is chase around for milk. On the last evening we asked if we may have breakfast in the room that evening as we had an early flight the next day and would be leaving before the chamber maid arrived to make breakfast, which we were told would be fine, but then upon getting back to the room that evening - there was no breakfast, after speaking with the evening chamber maid - who was very friendly and pleasant but unfortunately we couldnt understand each other, she called the Richmond hotel, I then spoke to reception there, who then spoke to her etc etc and we did eventually get part of a breakfast, but it all seemed a lot of effort for things that should just be part of the service. We also had a nice flower in the room at the beginning of our stay, it was still there dead and wilted at the end, in my opinion, it may be the fact that we were going the next day for why the flower wasn't changed/fruit bowl wasn't replenished, just remains of which put in the fridge/toiletries not replenished, but it is these types of things that I would expect to be taken into account for the price of the stay and I believe that it shoudn't matter when you are leaving, you should not be treated as 'oh well, they leave soon, dont bother'. We did also find the room quite noisy as the walls seemed quite thin and you could hear the buzzer next door/phone/ footsteps like they were in the same room. I spent alot of time researching to find the 'perfect' hotel as this was for a special trip for my partners birthday, which adds to the disappointment in the type of things I have mentioned.

We stayed for 5 nights total. One at the beginning of our trip and 4 at the end before coming home. We stayed in the mid-grade rooms both times, the blue room (Indigo, I think it's called) and the brown room (Turtle Dove, maybe). As many have already written you enter through a door around the corner from the fountain itself and climb many stairs to get to the 6 rooms. We were prepared for these details thanks to the reviews on TripAdvisor. The location is minutes away from a metro stop and its not much further to Termini train station. The minibar is complimentary and they even provide complimentary wine and cheese on the terrace in the evening if the weather is nice. We even had some complimentary wine and cheese offered in our room one evening because it was raining. The owners were very helpful, gave a good dinner recommendation, and arranged for transportation to the airport the day we left. Breakfast is included and served either on the terrace or in the room. It includes bread, croissants, cheese, fruit, coffee, etc. The first morning we were there we were served breakfast in our room by a very nice staff member (Laura I think) who didn't speak much English but it didn't really matter. She was very nice and helpful despite not speaking much English. During the second stay there was a different staff member working the mornings and that's where we ran into some minor problems... I don't think we ever got her name but she spoke pretty good English. The first morning with her we requested breakfast in our room and she obliged but made a rude comment about it supposed to be served on the terrace that day. I understood that but we were told during check in the first day that breakfast was usually served on the terrace during nice weather but it would not be a big deal if we wanted it in our room instead. As it was October and the mornings can be a little cool my wife preferred to have breakfast in our room. The next day day I ordered breakfast in our room again from the same staff member and ordered cappuccinos thinking she would need to know the type of coffee we wanted. This somehow upset her and she snapped at me: \"The menu is the same as yesterday!\" The next two mornings we just asked her if it was alright to have breakfast in the room trying not to upset her. She obliged each day but it was clear she was not too happy about it. I know all this isn't a big deal but she could definitely use some instruction on offering better service. We pretty much laughed it off and made a joke over which one of us would have to order from her. But someone else might not take it so well and let it sour their experience at this wonderful hotel. On the morning of our last day, on our way out with our bags, my wife heard this same staff member arguing/scolding another couple of guests. Not sure what was going on there but maybe we weren't the only ones who had issues with her. We would stay again!

Everything is included, from the high speed wireless to the mini-bar and a wonderful breakfast with cappuccinos on the terrace. These are very nice benefits compared to other \u201cluxury\u201d hotels that charge exorbitant fees for such amenities. We stayed in the Swanky Cardinal room which was right inside the front entrance. We were initially a little concerned about the potential for noise of people coming and going past our room late at night or going to breakfast in the morning. However, the room was amazingly quite and we were not disturbed at all. The location, which is a little off the beaten path, is very central and close to everything and as close to perfect as you could get. You can walk just about everywhere within 10 mins. Andrea was wonderful and made every effort to make our stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible. He marked a map with several non-tourist restaurants in different parts of the city for us; we used two of his recommendations and enjoyed the best meals of our stay in Rome. Prior to our departure, he even gave us a tour of the old Moses Fountain and the old aqueduct that supplied water to the fountain; this is where the new reception area is to be built. The Moses Fountain is a lovely slice of Roman life and a great way to truly experience the Eternal City.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex, England", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel - loved it in every way!\u201d", "Author": "Pistol007Uk", "ReviewID": "UR67512667", "Content": "Stayed here in May for a 4 night stay.

The room was always clean, the hallway was always immaculate, a breakfast of cappuccino, juice and croissants were brought to our room each morning. On the last night we were upgraded to the deluxe Theresa Sofa room which was huge, beautiful and had a shower room with pretty moodlights and a little window where you could watch the hustle bustle of Rome as you showered (hey it beats singing!). Only small downside was that from our first room we could hear the people in the neighboring room getting up at the crack of dawn each morning, they were Australian and had a small child.

However if you are looking for a unique experience and something a little different, then this is for you. Finding the hotel is the first challenge. Although it is within walking distance of the Republica Metro Station and a little further to Termini Station, I would recommend you take a taxi from the airport (FCO). It should not cost more than EUR 40 via a meter taxi. Don't let the drivers intimidate you if they offer a \"flat fee\" of EUR 60+. Just say no and wait for the next one. The hotel is located almost directly behind The St.Regis Grand Hotel. Just to the left on the corner. The Moses Fountain itself, is currently under renovation ( under the direction of the hotel owners) and is hidden by scaffolding. It is set to open hopefully in the spring according to Andreas. Once you find the hotel ( a simple wooden door built into a big concrete wall - opposite a church) and press the buzzer another world awaits you. If you have problems climbing stairs - this is not for you. You will need to carry your luggage up several flights to reach the front door of the hotel/guest house . There you will meet Andrea or Emanuela. The rooms (6 of them) are all different - but spacious. We stayed in a standard room. The bathroom was a big size and was a treat to use. Although the double bed seemed a bit on the small size it was reasonably comfortable. Free wifi and sat tv was good ( hint - some movies you can switch to English) Breakfast was delivered daily by Mae. An excellent choice of fruit, breads / toast , fresh juice and Cappuccino. A great way to start the day. All the sights of Rome are carefully explained by Emanuela , including good restaurants to eat.

After wading through pages and pages of hotels on various travel sites including TA, we stumbled upon the Moses Fountain Hotel - And I'm sure glad we did. For Americans, traveling in Europe without a tour can be an interesting endeavor. In the US we're used to consistency across hotel brands and general consistency in room sizes. This couldn't be further from the truth in Italy (or old Europe) where a city's age has a lot to do with dictating the size and amenities of a hotel. Admittedly, we were a bit nervous as we saw a lot of inconsistency in the reviews for supposedly good hotels. Furthermore, price didn't seem to have any impact on quality. Needless to say, we weren't sure what to expect. Then we arrived at the Moses Fountain Hotel and had what we consider as the best stay of our trip. Our room was the \"Swanky Cardinal\" which was decorated in a lovely and ironically sinful red. The room was spacious by Italian standards with a good sized bathroom and a balcony overlooking the hidden gem of Santa Maria della Vittoria. The bed was comfy and the communication options (TV/wifi) were great. Also, the free mini-bar was a lifesaver when coming back from day long walks in Rome. I would like to give special attention to our shower. I want one of these in my eventual home. It was a wondrous, mosaic tile laden relaxation place with fun fiber-optic lighting (I took night showers just to use the lights). Very tall and about two to three times as wide as any other shower I used in Italy, it was the greatest amenity we had on our trip. The location of the Hotel was fantastic - right in the triangle between the Via Veneto, Trevi Fountain and the Termini, it was quick to walk anywhere. In fact, that's one of the best parts of Rome - as long as you're not on the edge of the city, you can walk ANYWHERE. As a result of its central location, the MFH worked out great. There is plenty to eat in the surrounding area as well (after a few block walk to the right of the side entrance you can still find good dinner at 10PM on Sunday). Some folks on TA have complained about the noise. We really didn't notice it. It's city noise and we've both lived in cities in the past so what's there is to be expected. I'd be surprised if anywhere else in Rome with exterior windows was different. We also felt very safe here and the room has an ample safe where I could store my electronic gear and cash without worry. The owners and staff were wonderful and I need to give a special thanks to Emmanuella (hoping I didn't misspell her name). She greeted us so warmly after what had been a long overnight journey and got us entirely situated in our room and in the city. Daily breakfast was a treat - we never made it out on the terrace for it, but it was nice to have in our room. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would love to come back and see the lobby when it's done (they are currently renovating the fountain and entrance - we didn't experience any noise from this).

We were pleased with our stay but feel that some of the reviews here are a bit overstated/inflated with respect to some elements of the hotel. The good: The rooms are well appointed with modern, chic decor and include free WiFi, complimentary drinks (beer, soft drinks, water, Pringles, nuts), continental breakfast, a spacious bathroom and nice (Etro) bath products. We were met and greeted by Andre and given a very comprehensive overview of what to see and eat. Andre's restaurant recommendations served some of the best (and, might I add, non-touristy) food we had while in Rome. The location was great and we did not at any point think that the area was seedy or dangerous (this was one of my chief concerns when booking the hotel) relative to any other big city. The hotel even gave us a free bottle of wine one night. We had a very early checkout and Andre met us at 6:30 am. He was prompt and cheery. The cons: From reading some of the reviews, you would expect the rooms to be palatial, but they are not. They are certainly nice and well decorated but they were not so big as to warrant the effusive comments that others have made in their reviews. Perhaps this point isn't so much a \"con,\" since we were just fine with the room size, but we just think it's necessary to manage people's expectations when reading some of the reviews posted on here. So, in summary of this point, the Turtle Dove room (which was a \"superior\" type/priced room) was average. The bathroom, however, was quite spacious and the appointments were excellent (two basins, large shower/tub). We could definitely hear our (adjacent) neighbors on 2 of the 4 nights we stayed at the hotel. Also, each morning, we could hear Emmanuela getting breakfast ready in the hallway/small work room. This is probably my biggest complaint about the hotel and the place where they could use the most improvement. Lastly, the hotel was difficult to find. As other reviewers have mentioned, the best way to find it is either to reference the St. Regis hotel (around the corner from the hotel) or the Church of Saint Mary of Victory (immediately across the street). The hotel did, however, send us a picture of the front door/entryway which was extraordinarly helpful as it gave us an idea of what to look for.

Fruit basket, continental breakfast, free drinks in our mini bar was such a welcome treat. It was also our 20th year anniversary and we came back one night to our room to a nice bottle of wine! Free access to the wifi internet. Free drinks in the mini fridge, hair blower, in-room safe, and espresso machine. Facilities - Remodeled and brand new. Room was spacious (definitely for European standards!!!) clean, nicely decorated with modern . It had a double sink, marble floors, central air conditioning, bidet and best of all, the bed is large (queen size) and firm. Our room is soundproof and we did not hear our room guest in the next room nor any of the traffic from outside. There is a rooftop terrace where we had our breakfast (fresh squeezed orange juice, coffee, croissant, cheese, biscuits, toast, muffin, fresh melon).

Don't expect that this is a full service hotel (laundry, concierge, phone line availaibility (unable to receive or call out), restaurant, lobby, etc. If you want a boutique hotel which provdes privacy, security, comfortable rooms, a nice bed, location, this is the place.

Plenty of room, high ceilings, freshly stocked fridge, fruit, double sinks in the bathroom, satellite TV, and in a great location (about 10-15 minute walk to most attractions). The other thing that really sets this hotel apart is the personal service.

The restaurant recommendations were perfect. My wife and I loved the \"non-touristy\" places that she recommended.

As soon as I saw the website I was in love with the rooms as they looked gorgeous! Sadly, because I dallied on booking our flights, we couldn't get a reservation for the whole of our trip. I was gutted! James did go away again and find an alternative, but I was so disappointed about missing out on the Moses, we decided to book it for the two nights that were available, and then spend the rest of our trip at Hotel FortySeven (I will be writing a review of that one too)... We arrived by a car that James had arranged to collect us from the airport, and thank goodness as I think we'd have really struggled to find it on our own. (I would definitely recommend this). The Moses Fountain isn't so much a hotel, but more a set of independent rooms within a large townhouse. There is no reception or foyer, for example, but there is a communal terrace area. We were greeted by Andrea, the owner, who had liased with James about our arrival time, so he was around to let us into the building, which is very discreetly marked with a small sign. We were staying in the Turtle Dove room, although we had requested the Indigo one (we were given a choice). Still, it didn't at all matter as the room was stunning. It was very elegant and beautifully styled and we just fell in love with the bathroom with its two sinks, huge mirrors and fantastic shower. Our only complaints would be the steps, the small balcony and the noise. The steps from the outside up to the main 'hotel' building were quite steep and plentiful, which is not ideal with luggage, but thankfully, Andrea helped us on the way in, and my lovely boyfriend carried everything on the way out! The balcony we had (which is used as a selling point on their website) wasn't actually functional as it overlooked another building and was too small for any furniture. In the mornings we were woken up very early by sirens and loud traffic. We're used to this kind of mayhem where we live, so it certainly wouldn't put us off staying here again, but if we were coming for a more relaxing break, it wouldn't have been great. On both of our mornings in the hotel we had breakfast served in our room. The housemaid brought in what we asked for on a tray with a stand and we enjoyed our breakfast in bed, which was a really lovely little luxury! The breakfast selection was somewhat limited for my personal requirements (I require a wheat-free diet as much as possible), but in all fairness to the hotel, the breakfast was exactly as was advertised on the website - there was croissants, toast, bread, muesli, yoghurt and melon. To drink we had fresh orange juice and tea or coffee. Personally, a choice of eggs and a wider choice of fruit would complete breakfast for me, but this minor point would certainly not put me off staying there again! In terms of location, this was ideal for the first part of our trip as on our first day, we walked just five minutes to get a bus tour to get a feel for the city and the sights that we might want to go back and see properly. However, I agree with the other reviews that say that on the whole the area was a little seedy, and I didn't feel as safe at night when walking back as I did when walking back to our second hotel. This again wouldn't put me off staying here a second time, but we would probably go to other areas of town to have dinner and drinks.

The bathroom is very large for European standards and everything was very clean. Our view was of the Agriculture & Forestry building down the road, with orange and palm trees. The street is a little noisy, but that did not bother us in the room. The mini bar is complimentary -- drinks, snacks and a lovely fruit basket awaited us when we arrived. The owner was very nice and helpful. He manages several properties so be sure to let him know when you plan to check out so he will be there. There is a corkscrew in the room should you want to enjoy a bottle of wine. The breakfast was great - nice cappuccinos and an assortment of pastries, fruit, and yogurt.

But they are really cool and elegant apartments -- roomy, with fabulous showers (some even have steam), and all the amenities of a hotel to boot. One mild downside is you have to pretty much know when you are arriving and commit to it and stick to it -- not that modest deviations can't be accommodated, but it makes it much easier if you are at least relatively close to being on time, as you need an \"orientation\" to how the place works. If you are really freewheeling it and cannot pin down within at least morning or afternoon as to when you will want to \"check in,\" this may not be the best option for you. But don't be deterred as rewards of staying here are ample. There is a bit of construction going on right now on the MOses fountain itself and unfortunately you can't see that sight, but I didn't find it very distracting or off-putting. A real plus is the view of the church across the street which you definitely must enter, as it contains several masterpiece sculptures by the great Bernini, including the Ectasy of Saint Therese. Don't miss it. I said \"near the Spanish steps,\" it is perhaps a 10-15 minute walk but better than staying right there where it is extremely touristy. It is also a short walk from the train station which is another advantage. If you are into high end shopping all of those places are nearby as well. Villa Borghese is also in walking distance (reserve tickets to the classical museum if you want to see it). The modern art gallery is worth a visit and it too is not that far away.

The hotel has about 6 rooms only and each one has been designed differently by Emanuella's brother (architect) and one of his colleagues who is a specialist interior designer. The key to this hotel are the rooms - they are breathtaking. My wife and I stayed in the Red Room - the highlight of which (apart from the comfortable bed and amazing balcony) was the walk in shower/spa. The hotel has a great terrace where guests have breakfast in the morning (served by Laura) overlooking the streets of Rome. My wife and I also had a few glasses of Champagne out there in the evening before heading out to dinner as this was the last stop on our Honeymoon trip to Italy. Location is excellent - Heather and I just walked around - everything can be reached by foot but you might want to take the metro/bus/taxi if you get tired or if it is too hot. There was a lovely Spanish couple that turned up to check in late one evening when Heather and I were on the terrace. Luckily we were there so we could call Emanuella's brother (on call 24 hours) who came to check them in. Another reminder to make sure you stay in contact with the owners and stick to your times. Not sure what they would have done if we were not on the terrace. There is parking very near by for those traveling by car. In summary - this really was a lovely way to end our honeymoon trip. The hotel is classy, elegant and beautiful. It is not the cheapest place but that is not what we were looking for. The lack of reception may be an issue for some people but Heather and I are very independent so this did not bother us at all.

It's very close to the Train Station (but out of sight) and there are other fine hotels in the vicinity. There is no elevator - this is not a handicapped friendly edifice - but if you can climb a few flights of nicely aged stairs, you'll find yourself in a clean, very fresh and new home/apartment/hotel conversion.

The location does not put you directly in the historical downtown area, but it's not a long walk. And the area it's in seems to be more lively with an actual Roman crowd, as opposed to a tourist mass - which I thought was nice. It's very quiet in the rooms, outfitted with powerful air conditioners, and the most recent bathroom fixtures, plus modern/contemporary artistic light fixtures. The rooms have safes and minibars, the contents of which are, nicely, free. (The contents are not as extensive as what you'll find in a pay mini-bar, so bring your own booze if you must have some, but it's still a nice touch). There is a lovely outdoor sitting area with tables and chairs on a mid-level terrace, surrounded by jasmine blossoms, so it smells great. There are several superior touches, as well. The soaps they provide are excellent, and I had a free upgrade (not sure why!) to a room that had an enormous, fully tiled circular shower/steambath with a sliver of a window bringing in light from high over the street.
