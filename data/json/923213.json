{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Reccomended This is a great little hotel, I booked this hotel based on previous reviews, so I thought I would come on here and recommend it myself.I went to Beijing on my own for 4 nights to see what its like. It is quite a crazy place, Chinese people seem to take advantage of tourists at every possible opportunity.The Autumn Garden Hotel however is amazing, such nice people, and I consider it a great price for what I got. Its location is great if you want to get a slight feel of what its like living in China.You need to walk down a couple of narrow alley ways to get to the Hotel, but it is very close to Tienanmen Square, with a lot of sites close by, such as the Temple of Heaven and Forbidden City within walking distance. Also there is a touring company with nice and cheap tours (although in Chinese) which is less than 10 minutes walk away next to Tienanmen Square.The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is simple but decent. The People are fantastic, talk English and are very very helpful. They picked me up from the airport without any charge, Im not sure if this is a regular service, but it was helpful. If it is your first time in China, I recommend getting picked up, as taxi drivers talk very little English if any at all, and the Hotel can be hard to find, Taxi drivers wont know it.The hotel welcomes you very nicely, and give you a map to the area and to the hotel, and even a mobile phone to use while you stay with them.The hotel had everything you should need, but I was truly impressed by the service there which easily allows me to recommend it. In contrast to most of the Chinese which I met who seemed to try and take me for every cent that I had, this little hotel was there for me for every need, without trying to charge me for the help that they offered, or even the things which I expected to pay for such as the half a day late checkout, or airport pick up.If you want a simple, relaxing, and friendly stay, try the Autumn Garden. I will no doubt be staying there again on my next visit.", "Date": "Dec 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR699401976", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Yousef515"}, {"Content": "an oasis in Beijing       the courtyard", "Date": "Nov 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR181818833", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "travellingviolet"}, {"Content": "Lovely traditional style hotel       The interior courtyard", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR578483503", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Nurse Gertrude"}, {"Content": "Living it the Beijing way As I was looking for accommodation for my visit during the Olympics in late 2007, most of the major hotels were not available for booking for IOC-related room blocks. Which means when I booked it everything everywhere was very expensive. Then I found this little courtyard hotel, and was charged at least 4 times their published rates, yet still I am happy with what I got. Situated 3 layers deep from the main streets, you will either need to have good map reading skills to navigate your way to find this on your own... or you could use their free tricycle service which would pick you up from either Qianmen or Hepingmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant.I love the surrounding of this guesthouse. It is a typical hutong where houses are one next to the other, and rather peaceful and quiet. That means it's not the best place to stay if you are expecting upper class and polished streets. In fact, you will find at least 3 smelly public toilets along the way to the guesthouse. But that's what's genuine about the neighbourhood. The location is also quite fantastic... a 5-10 minute walk (or less with tricycle) would bring you to the subway station (Hepingmen and Qianmen), and also Tiananmen Square... that's a big plus for those who like to travel the local way (on foot or subway).Rooms are not big, but adequate, with modern bathroom amenities (good and strong hot showers!). Room rates include free use of internet and breakfast (Chinese or western style, pick whatever you want).You cannot reach this place by taxi, so be ready to have a little hassle when you arrive and depart. The tricycle rider is friendly and could get you to the main streets. I arrived in a chauffeured car and the driver had no clue where it was and luckily I did my research and found the property myself. Although I paid the rate for a 5-star hotel, I wouldn't have done it any other way.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR373418097", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "CHM1"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d923213-r22711801-Autumn_Garden_Courtyard_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "923213", "Price": "$88"}}
