The staff was friendly, but the building could've done with some renovations. Also, there's no elevator, so pack light unless you want to haul your suitcase up multiple flights of stairs. We had a private double room-it had two twin beds pushed together, a desk, small TV and a wash basin and mirror with hot and cold water. The ladies bathroom and two showers were on our side of the floor but the men's bathroom was on the other side, which is a little annoying if you have to go in the middle of the night. If you want some privacy with your shower you're at the mercy of a thin blue shower curtain, so be prepared. Overall, the hotel reminded me of an aging European student dormitory. The location is gorgeous, turn the corner and the little cafes and tree lined streets almost look Parisian. The hotel is right across the street from the S-Bahn and a little further away at the other end of Stuttgarter Platz is an U-Bahn station. It takes around 30-45 minutes to make your way to East Berlin's popular neighborhoods, but the trains run regularly so it's not that bad. There are many amazing restaurants within walking distance (or even sneezing distance!) from the hotel, and you can skip the \u20ac7 hotel breakfast and find something much tastier and cheaper around the corner. If you just want somewhere cheap to sleep and shower, here you go. Kind of cute in a run down bohemian kind of way.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jette, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGood location, friendly staff, some renovations needed\u201d", "Author": "RReds", "ReviewID": "UR120451224", "Content": "Location is perfect for a city trip.

However, despite being just across the road from a train station, our twin room on the third floor was quiet and clean. The windows had double glazing (which must have helped) and there didn't seem to be many people staying on our floor as I never saw anyone in the communal bathroom. The Wifi was too weak to use on the third floor, but worked well near the reception and in the breakfast room. Our room did get rather hot the four days we were there due to the warm weather at the time, but the hostel had provided a fan in our room which helped. The room also included a basin with hot and cold water, which surprised me for a hostel. The S-bahn trains into the centre run frequently past this stop (about every 5 minutes during the day) and the trip to Alexanderplatz was around 20 minutes, so not too bad. We were also pleasantly surprised to find that the Underground and S-bahn trains run all night on Fridays and Saturdays - very handy!", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Varna", "Title": "\u201cNice\u201d", "Author": "toni4ka3", "ReviewID": "UR52068983", "Content": "Nice hotel, big rooms and confortable beds I didnt like the bathroom at all The shower was with sensors what makes it almost impossible to shower normally and the floor of bathroom was always dirty.

This is no place for anybody who wants to get a decent night's sleep. The night I stayed there, there were few guests and they weren't particularly rowdy, but you still heard slamming and banging and clunking down the hallway almost all night. I can only imagine how raucous things would be if a group of kids on a school trip were staying there. And this is just the kind of hostel you'd expect those kind of guests. It cost me 35 Euros a night, so it wasn't even particularly cheap. For a few Euros more I could have stayed in a nicer quieter place.

Our first night we were at the back of the hotel, where the mattress must have been in excess of 20 years old it was just a sack of springs, and we itched terribly all night. The guests in the room next door were noisy all night, running up and down the stairs etc. We did complain after our first night and we were moved to the front of the hotel where the room had a proper mattress, but the noise levels were even worse in this part of the hotel. There are no communal facilities, except a kitchen, which you have to pay 1 Euro per person to use each day. Because of the lack of communal facilities the younger people either sat out in the corridors talking to each other, they kept their doors open with the TV blasting out and kept walking from each other's rooms all night long. There is no carpet in the corridors so everyone sounds like an elephant, and you can hear people entering the building a walking up all the stairs from your rooms.

The setting reminded me very much of my college dorm days. My kids liked the free internet access. While breakfast is available, it is not included in the price of the room. The room rates were very good. Every four or five rooms had access to one male and one female bathroom. The men's bathroom had the showers and toilets separate, whereas the women's bathroom did not.

Our booking was done online and we were suprised to learn that the reception provided us with a 3 bedded room even if we only were two people. Well the only downsite to the room was that it smelled like a smoking room, we had requested a non-smoking room, but never mind, we're not picky and bought a air-freshner and that helped. There was a small tv, a table, 3 chairs, a wardrobe, a sink and mirror in the room and a window opening out to a peaceful courtyard. Regarding the sharing of bathroom with the other guests, that was no problem at all, and the hotel did a good job of cleaning them every day. We didn't really have any problems with noise from other guests except the occasional chit chat out on the hall, when someone was going to use the bathroom. If you don't get along with stairs then this is maybe not the right place for you to stay because there is no elevator and the stairs can be really hard to climb after a long day of walking the city. Next to the hotel there is a small cafe called \" Coffee To Go\"and the breakfast and the wonderful service made us promise that we will be back later this year. Try it and also try their vitamin-bomb hot drink, that was really tasty.

Shared bathrooms with three other rooms on the floor. The big pluses are location and affordability. The hostel/pension is almost directly acros the street from the Charlottenburg S-Train stop making it simple to get anywhere in the central city within minutes. The block the Berolina is on is nothing special, but the nearby neighbourhood is a fairly posh residential area, very nice for walking. And we paid 50Euros per night for three people in our own room, an excellent rate. (We didn't opt for breakfast.) Our room was basic - three single beds, a wardrobe and a small TV, window opening on to a courtyard - but bright and cheerful. Staff were friendly and there is a breakfast available or kitchens for a small extra charge. Great coffee/pastry place two doors down. We were there during the Easter break and the hostel seemed popular with German student groups on school tours. They were noisy one evening, but nothing alarming. And there are no elevators, so check on your floor if you have difficulty with stairs. It's much more hostel than hotel, with the option of private rooms. Booking by e-mail was fast and efficient. If you do stay, definitely buy the Berlin WelcomeCard available at S-train stations.
