{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Even though it was free using my points, still over priced! I was in Germany for work and stayed a couple of extra days on my own so I used my points to get a hotel room for a couple of nights. When I was waiting to check in, someone was before me, the hotel clerk was very rude to her. When I checked in she seemed impatient. She didn't explain anything to me at all. She just handed me the key to my room and told me where the elevator was located. When I went up to my floor, the lights were turned out in the hallway. Only the emergency lights were on. I noticed light switches outside of each door, but didn't know they turned on the hall lights temporarily till I found my rooms door. When the switch was turned on the hall lights would stay on for a minute. The room was ok, small beds and a very small TV. I would rate it as a 1 star hotel. The room was far worse than any Comfort Inn I have ever stayed at in the past. There was a sign in the elevator that said that breakfast was from 6:30-9:30, no other information was with it. I went down to breakfast the next morning. The layout was horrible, there was't much choices and the food that was there didn't look that appealing, but since this was a comfort inn, I assumed there breakfasts were for free and couldn't really complain. I almost felt like they put out poorly cooked food so they wouldn't have to spend that much on breakfast.When I checked out, I was charged $10 euros a day for breakfast, about $17-18 USD. The breakfast wasn't worth it at all. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. The only good thing about it was that it was close to the train station and could easily get there and back without a problem. Other than that, I would warn people to stay away.", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR358580229", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Jeffstl34"}, {"Content": "Unethical Business Operation Travelers Beware !Booked thru Hostelbookers.Being charged by one night even it is within free cancellation period.Furthermore, given an empty promised from the hotel management that a refund will be make.Take note:Address: [--]", "Date": "Aug 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR331688451", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Cloud_101"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d233993-r20591565-Comfort_Inn_Frankfurt_Karben-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "233993", "Price": "$143"}}
