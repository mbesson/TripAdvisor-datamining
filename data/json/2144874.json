First minor obstacle was finding the hotel as it's not visible from the street view and so had to resort to asking for assitance. The first person I asked was jettisonned abruptly when he tried to convince me I was in completely the wrong place, but he could take me there. I've travelled too many places to fall for scams like that. So I asked a local shopkeeper who pointed out that It was only 50 yards from where I was standing, down an alley between two cafes. Once in, I was happy with the room, which was clean and bright. As per other posters comments, the rooms and bathroom are very compact, which wasn't a problem for me as lone traveller with a small backpack, but may be a problem for a couple with luggage. I found the staff friendly and accomodating and I have to say that the breakfast was very good; a good selection of olives, salad, cheeses, and cold meats, supplemented by omelettes and freshly cooked crepes with cheese filling. After a good breakfast I didn't need a lunch. The only slight criticism I had was that because all the rooms were immediately off the rather echo-ing spiral staircase I was frequently woken late at night by the noise of slamming doors and the slap slap slap of feet up the marble staircase. Counter that however with the excellent location, opposite the Topkapi Palace and 5 mins walk to the Hagia Sopihia and Blue Mosque, and overall I'd say I was happy with my choice and would rate it as good value for money.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai, Maharashtra, India", "Title": "\u201ccute little hotel,great staff\u201d", "Author": "Yashodhara P", "ReviewID": "UR126570169", "Content": "very centrally located,walking distance from all monuments.Small but clean and comfortable rooms.Young,vivacious and very helpful staff.Great breakfast and all the staff was very hospitable.Highly recommendable.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Izmir, Izmir, Turkey", "Title": "\u201c\"Perfect\" , I could not find another word about MinelHotel.\u201d", "Author": "\u00c4\u00b0lhan S", "ReviewID": "UR126481624", "Content": "Rooms clean and well-groomed, friendly employees, very nice breakfast.

Clean, comfortable, great location, friendly staff... all this for an incredible rate! It was the perfect hotel. I went on this trip with a couple friends. The staff were all so helpful and accomodating, allowing us to store our luggage when we got there early in the morning on the day we arrived and after we checked out (since our flights left late that night). We were only there for a short trip and we knew practically no Turkish, but thankfully the staff spoke English very well. They had all kinds of suggestions on places to go and answered all the questions we had for them. We were offered tea or coffee almost everytime we walked through the door. Breakfast was so good, omelets, several different kinds of breads, yogurt, meat, cheese, fresh fruit, etc. When you walk into the hotel, the front desk is right there and there is a nice size common room with chairs and tables. This is where breakfast is served and it is the perfect place to gather, have a cup of tea, meet other guests, chat with the staff, read your guidebook, plan your day, etc. The rooms were clean and modern, with a bright blue motif. I especially loved the large showers with both a handheld shower head and a large waterfall shower head (and plenty of hot water). The beds were large and comfortable with plenty of pillows and a nice warm comfortor. The only negative things I can say about this hotel is that there is no elevator (although the staff were very willing to help carry bags up the narrow stairs) and the double room/bathroom were a little small (but the space is maximized as much as possible). As for the location, it was a little hard to find because it's behind the main road that the tram runs along. I just asked a few people and they pointed me in the right direction. It's less than a block from the Gulhane metro stop and very easy to get to from there. It's a 5-10 minute walk to the Topkapi Palace, the Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome. 15 minutes to the Roman Cistern. 20 minutes to walk to the Grand Bazaar and the ferries to get to the Asian side. It's around the corner from one of the historic Hamams, Cagaloglu Hamami (great experience, although pricey compared to others). It's an easy metro ride to take either the tunnel to Istiklal Caddesi or the funicular to Taksim Square (shopping, restaurants, people watching). And a cab ride to the same area is only about 10TL.The Gulhane metro is also a direct line to the Istanbul Modern museum and the Dolmabahce Palace.

Good a/c and heater. Good water pressure for shower. Breakfast is good and filled you up for the morning. With only 9 rooms, it felt like you were staying at a posh friend's guestroom (which was great and I looked forward to coming back after a long day of traipsing around town). Some hotel staff have better English than others. That being said, I got very detailed directions to where I needed to go (even directions for using the bus). Staff were very hospitable, greeting you every time you came or went and offered tea / coffee every time they saw you. Staff were also honest that there are few decent (ie. non-tourist-trap) restaurants in the area. If you can, head over to the Istiklal Caddesi area (across the Galata Bridge) for meals. Much better selection at better prices. Loved being close to all the mosques, palaces and museums. Wonderful to see them in the day and then again lit up at night. Didn't like: Breakfast never changed, so after five days of exactly the same thing, it got a bit dull. Staircase to rooms is open, so if you have customers speaking loudly in Reception, you'll hear it from your room (at least I did, on the first floor). Otherwise, the hotel is quiet (it's on a side street off a side street). Be forewarned that the rooms are SMALL. Like just big enough for a double bed with a bit of room to spare. That being said, the design was very compact with lots of storage space. So once you get organized, it was good (except for the bathroom, which you needed a bit of acrobatics to negotiate...) However, I felt the hotel offered great value! Tips: (1) There is a shared shuttle going back to the airport for only 5 euro, bookable through the hotel. (2) Ask directions from the hotel how to get here FROM the airport. You can use combo metro/tram (but if you're arriving during working hours, the tram will be VERY crowded). It's a short 5-7 minute walk from the closest tram station. (3) Every time you switch lines, you will need to pay. You can either pay TL2 for a token or buy a transportation card which you top up with money (strangely, these are sold by regular kiosks selling other things, like kebabs). The benefit of the card (TL6, non-refundable) is that your subsequent trips (within 2 hours) are discounted (1st trip, TL 1.75, 2nd trip, TL 1.00). Didn't see them on sale at the airport and the ticket booth was unmanned with ticket machines only in Turkish (!) I totally fell in love with Istanbul and Minel Hotel was a good base for traveling. You could even walk to Eminonu in about 20 minutes (where the Bosphorus cruises leave from).
