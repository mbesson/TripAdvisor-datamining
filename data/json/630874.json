It is in an excellent location, literally 100 yards from St Marks Square and therefore the prices are excellent in comparison to other accommodation options in the nearby area. The hotel was clean and beautifully decorated. The breakfast terrace was very nice and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Finding the hotel could be a problem if you haven't done your research, but if you check the directions and location in advance it shouldn't be too much of an issue. Also, the hotel does not have 24 hour staff coverage and you gain entry by entering a code into a keypad. Therefore if you are arriving late request the entry code before you leave to avoid any problems on arrival. We did not do this and had to phone the owner when we reached the hotel. It was not a big problem as the owner answered straight away and provided the code, but it is probably easier to get the code in advance. The only problem we had was the size of the room. It was basically a bed, a wardrobe and very little space in between. If only travelling with luggage for the weekend it would not be a problem, but as we were visiting Italy for 15 days we were a bit short of space. I understand that some of the other rooms are a bit larger, therefore maybe you could request one of these when booking (we were in room 3). However, we only spent a very small amount of time in the room so it was not a major issue. Afterall, who goes to Venice to spend time in their hotel room!
