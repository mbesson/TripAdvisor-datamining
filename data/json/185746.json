I was greeted by the doorman and whenever we came and went, the doors were opened for us. The folks behind the front desk always had a smile and were so kind and professional - it's nice to see. They're doing it right, here! I had an upgraded room on the 33rd floor facing West (overlooking the Canadiens arena and train station). It looked like it was brand-new so I'm guessing they recently renovated. Our conference required the use of multiple meeting rooms (for meals, presentations, receptions etc) and all of the rooms were perfectly suited for their purpose. The grand ballroom downstairs suited our function perfectly and the Cafe Conc was excellent as well - one of the most unique spaces I've ever been in - it's a tiered/auditorium style seating area with a large stage at the front, allowing you to listen to a speaker/entertainment while enjoying your meal. Turns out, this place has quite a bit of history to it to boot - just ask any of the staff. As for location - I found it to be excellent, personally. Close to shopping, dining and the train station. The Starbucks and retail arcade off the lobby was beneficial as well. The only thing I did not get to try was the pool/gym area. Our conference kept us a little to busy for that. I would definitely choose this hotel again and can't wait for the opportunity to do so. I encourage others to as well - you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abbotsford", "Title": "\u201cWowed\u201d", "Author": "euphamia", "ReviewID": "UR128119983", "Content": "I went to a conference and had the pleasure of staying at this hotel.

Beautiful lobby, well everything in the hotel was beautiful. Room was great, spacious, with a great view of the city. All ameneties worked fine. On site parking for a reasonable fee. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 are two aspects that you may not think of much, but really irritated me. First off, get your valet to explain things better. He tried to explain the parking situation about 4 times, before I finally asked him to stop and told him I'd figure it out myself. He could have said, \"You park yourself for X dollars, or we park you for X dollars\", instead he spoke like a moron. Check in took forEVER. There were people in front of me who also took a while to check in. I personally was at the counter for about 10 minutes, even though I had a reservation, and all they needed to do was swipe my credit card and have me sign. Also, the directions in the hotel are poor. When you take the elevator from the garage into the hotel, it brings you to one of the other areas in the building (there are businesses, stores, etc in addition to the hotel), and there are virtually no signs or directions BACK to the hotel.

It was a downhill slide from there. First off, admittedly through no fault of the hotel we were given a hard time at check in because we forgot our Government ID at home. Once that was sorted we were told we had a room with only 1 bed. The Marriott online reservation system allows you to book \"one king or 2 doubles\" and then asks you to check off your preference further into the reservation process, the same place you would ask for things like pillow preference or extra towels or early check in or higher floors. AT NO TIME DOES IT SAY YOU WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE ROOM TYPE YOU ASKED FOR. Apparently THIS Marriott makes the decision randomly as to where in the hotel you go and what room type you get. I have never encountered this problem at the other Marriott hotels that I have stayed at. The girl at the desk sent us a cot, a cot that looked like it was thrown out behind a homeless shelter. It was caved in, the mattress was stained and the frame itself was rusted and dirty. When we called down to complain and insist on being given the room type we booked we were told they were full and nothing could be done. I asked for the supervisor who called me back a few minutes later (I am pretty sure it was just the employee standing next to her). The \"supervisor\" was incredibly rude and again told me there were NO rooms available in the hotel and that she would send me a different cot or I could try going to another hotel down the street!!!! She said that they encounter this problem with the reservation system all the time and were not the first to complain and certainly not the last. I suggested they give us a second room with 1 bed and she said there was no way this would happen and we would have to accept the room we were given. She also pointed out that they had 5 floors under renovation and that SHE did US a favor by putting us on a higher floor in a non renovated room. HUH? She then said she would have a supervisor call us (thought we were already talking to a supervisor). The next call was from the Food and Beverage Manager??!??!? Although very friendly what does he have to do with room reservations? I work in a hotel, our food and beverage managers wouldn't even know how to turn on the desk computers let alone make or move a reservation. He feigned surprise at the fact that the hotel was so busy and offered my party free breakfast and wanted to come and look at the cot. He also offered to cover our parking charges. So basically we slept with 3 people in 1 bed and the 4th person on a cot (cot was replaced by a marginally better one). A very annoying and disappointing start to our night away. When things go like this then you tend to notice other things like the air vents full of cobwebs, the crumbs on the old carpet, the shower curtains that leaked and left an inch of water on the floor, the lack of additional towels we requested and the general rudeness of most of the staff.

The room was excellent and we enjoyed just sitting at the window with a glass of wine, watching the world go by. There is access to the Metro system from the hotel, but if there are two of you it is just as cheap to take a taxi into Old Montreal.

Place Jacques Cartier is where most of the restaurants are, although do branch off some of the side streets and you will find lots more. We did a 2 hr walking tour of Montreal with an excellent guide. The tour included entering the Basilica, which is beautiful. Montreal's history goes back about 300 years but there is not a lot to see of great interest on the walk. ( We are probably spoiled coming from Scotland where 5th century is considered old, not 1700's). We also did the Amphi tour; which was supposed to last 1.5 hours but we were back in 55 minutes. When the vehicle goes into the water the noise is shattering and the commentary difficult to hear and not especially great. A lot of money for what you get! If you are going to travel by train this might be useful to know. From Toronto to Montreal you can check in your luggage and get reserved seats. From Montreal to Quebec you can do neither. You carry your cases on and it's first come first served for seats. The lines form up very early, so the sooner you are in line the more likely of getting seats together.

The public areas are beginning to look a little dated and could use some 'lightning and brightening'. They really should do something about the check in desks as the staff seem to peer over them as if from a bunker - so it makes it feel slightly unwelcoming. That said the reception staff were friendly and helpful. I also found the hazard tape stretched rather unattractively across the revolving door at the main entrance made one feel one was entering a murder scene or building in the process of demolition. I'm sure it was there for a good reason, but you did feel that the first impression it gave was more one that the management couldn't care less. The room (King size bed) I stayed in was fine, comfortable and clean, although the lack of a safe deposit box in a supposedly upmarket hotel suggests it was all put together some time ago. The bathrooms are best described as 'compact' or 'bijoux', and could definitely do with a bit of updating. There's plenty of closet and draw space so no complaints on this front. My room had a TV, but the channels are nothing to write home about. I'm sure Canadian TV has a lot to offer, but strange not to find BBC World or CNN as one of the options. Great views if you get the right room. I used the gym and it was OK, again looked like the equipment had seen plenty of use. There was a pool, although can't say anything about it as I didn't use it. I tried the hotel restaurant breakfast one morning. It was nothing special, and you're probably better off eating out, or going to one of the concessions that is co-located in the hotel. The biggest positive about the hotel is the bar. Nice, friendly, helpful staff. Good tapas menu not too expensive, but the wine was overly priced in my opinion. Good approach to internet connection. Free, although you could upgrade to faster packages. I found the speed for the free service was perfectly acceptable, although I'm guessing if you want movies or Skype you'll need to upgrade. But I applaud the fact they provide a free service. I tried but failed to use the business centre. If you are Mac based, unless you have a USB key to copy documents to which then need to be loaded to the business centre PCs you'll struggle. There is no way of printing directly from a Mac.

There are several shops to explore in the lobby area, including Mont Blanc (lovely jewelry selections), plus a Starbucks, a clothing store, and your typical newspaper/drinks/candy store.I enjoyed strolling around and checking out all the things available in the lobby. Also we ate dinner at the restaurant located in the hotel and the service was outstanding. Our waiter couldn't have been friendlier and the food was great. Additionally, we had the breakfast buffett and it was so outstanding we had to come back again the next morning. Now, the rooms were on the small side, I will say that was somewhat disapointing, but what really made up for it was the huge curved windows. It was lovely to look out over the city. Request a high floor and a city view. Bedding was comfortable, room was clean. Bathroom had nice marble accents but was small. I had trouble adjusting the water pressure on the shower. But at least there was always plenty of hot water if you could figure out the adjustments.Oh, another thing, they were skimpy on towels. So ask for extra and they will oblige. As many have stated, the location is perfect, and you can go right under the hotel to the metro station or enter the underground shopping area, and on a cold February day in Canada, that was a much appreciated feature.

I found none of that to be the case. It was very clean, well appointed and modern. Our room had a half moon shaped window with a trim, perhaps they meant that was old fashion? I spoke to one staff member and he indicated that some d\u00c3\u00a9cor left on purpose not to lose old World charm. Complain about the size of rooms was unfounded!

Stayed at a few 4-star hotels before, I can say this one is the worst I've experienced. The first night my room was next to a generator (as I was told by the person at the front desk), the perpetual humming noise made me awake the whole night. The tricky thing is you can't hear the noise when you walk/talk in the room. But the second you are in the bed you can hear it. I suspect the noise comes from the lower floor, so the vibration travels via the wall against the bed. As a result of it, I requested a room change. The horror continued. The new room was next to a service elevator. This elevator goes up and down more frequent more than you can imagine. When I requested the room, I specifically asked the person if the new one would be quiet. She said yes, and of course she lied to me with the knowledge that it's next to a service elevator. I doubt the fact that when they designed/built the hotel, they bothered to conduct an acoustic study of the rooms. This is NOT a 4-star hotel. There are many better hotels at the location. Do yourself a favour, choose another hotel chain. Having stayed at other 4-star hotels before, this one gives me the worst experience ever.

As it happens, we had honeymooned there in 1971, so we were looking forward to a return visit. In 1971, the CC was pretty spiffy -- it was new, had a couple of highly rated restaurants, and felt modern and fashionable. That's all past, I'm afraid. The conference part of the hotel's service was quite good; continental breakfasts, a luncheon, refreshment breaks, and room arrangements were handled very efficiently and accurately. As for our stay, we got off to a bad start when no room was ready for us for our 3 p.m. check-in. We found this out only after waiting through a very long line -- the longer because the check-in worker ahead of us decided to go on break as we were waiting, and everyone in the line had to find other lines to join (at the rear). We returned to the lines twice more before we got our room key. Two of our three check-in people were exceptionally unfriendly, and the shift manager really looked like she wanted to be somewhere else. (This isn't characteristic of Marriott in my experience.) The last check-in person was much more personable, though not so very efficient. When we got to our room, the soaps from the previous guests hadn't been cleaned up, and no new soaps had been provided. We phoned about that, and, to give the hotel credit, two soaps arrived lickety-split. Other reviewers have noted the tired appearance outside and inside, which is true, and they note that the hotel connects to the metro and underground city, which is also true. If you arrive by train, the hotel is very convenient, and it's just a few minutes' walk to the touristy restaurants on Peel. But it's a fair hike from the more interesting parts of Montreal, like the old city, St. Catharine & University, the Latin Quarter, McGill, Mount Royal, and St-Denis / Prince Arthur.

Frankly, I've never paid that much for a 4* hotel in Montreal before, and I feel like I've gotten better value for my money elsewhere (Hyatt Regency & Delta Centre-Ville, for example, both under USD$80/night). However, it seemed to be a busy time in Montreal and hotel rooms were in short supply, which might explain the higher nightly cost. At any rate -- the good points: The location of the hotel is excellent -- a short walk from the train station (where I arrived) and the hotel is right on top of the Bonaventure Metro station, directly accessible from an elevator in the hotel lobby. It was very easy to walk to Ste-Catherine street and Old Montreal. The lobby is classic and features a Starbucks (although its opening hours seemed rather short). Front desk and room service staff were excellent. A big plus was free wireless Internet, in room and in the lobby. I did order room service once, and the food was excellent. The bed, too, was excellent, as was the view, but.... The not-so-good points: The rooms. Others have said it here and it is true, the rooms are in need of a major refresh. My room was a king on a high floor, and it looked exactly as represented in the king room pictures the hotel provides on its website. The room was clean, but tired, and the furniture is slightly damaged and not particularly new. The bigger problem was the first room they gave me -- on the 33rd floor -- had a very noticeable humming/buzz that permeated the whole room -- seemed to be in the walls. In fact, you could hear it on the floor in general. I asked for another room and was given another one on the same floor -- but with the same buzz, although quieter this time. Eventually I got used to it, but it was somewhat annoying all the same. I actually got off the elevator at other floors to see if the buzz was there, and it wasn't -- so you may want to avoid the 33rd floor -- and maybe the floors around it. All in all, while the rooms were a bit outdated, the stay was pleasant and the location and service can't be beat. Had I paid rack rate for the room, I think I would not have been happy. Even $105 I thought was pushing it, but I have seen rooms at this hotel go for $80-90/night, which would be more in line with what it offers. A real refresh of the rooms would make a big difference. Two tips for getting around: (1) If you are arriving by train, you can walk underground to this hotel, by following the signs to Bonaventure Metro station -- be warned though, there are plenty of luggage unfriendly stairs and revolving doors on the way. If the weather is nice, I suggest walking on the street -- it is a block away. (2) Montreal transit (STM) now offers a weekly pass, from Monday-Sunday, in addition to its tourist passes (1 and 3 days). Passes now use an electronic chip card, which you have to pay for (up to $7.00, depending when you buy) in addition to the pass cost. Current prices are available on the STM website--but either way, the passes are a great deal since the subway gets you most places in Montreal so you can avoid high cab fees. And a final tip if you are a business traveler -- the business centre at the hotel is very expensive ($0.50/page for b&w printing!). There is a Staples/Business Depot/Bureau en gros at the central train station with an excellent copy-and-print centre -- use them instead. I needed to print a number of reports which I took to them on a memory key and they produced them in 20 minutes at a very good price.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leesburg, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cVintage hotel - that's good, and bad\u201d", "Author": "travelingFelix", "ReviewID": "UR65819272", "Content": "The Chateau Champlain was built in 1966 and was one of the top hotels in Montreal.

This is by far the worst Marriott I have ever stayed at. This hotel is very old and dated (think curved shower curtain rod and a very dated television).

We were promised \"free\" wireless internet, but the connection was so poor that I was only able to log on for a few minutes at a time. And no upgrade for us. We never expect a room upgrade, but it would have been nice to have a room on one of the higher floors since this was such a special occassion for us. Beware of the coffee makers in the room. My husband left with two stained dress shirts as the lids to the disposable coffee cups aren't made to size and fall off. Ridiculous! As was the inoperable remote control. The battery must have been dead--you think they would check these things periodically to make sure everything is the best it can be for their guests. Along with all of this, the service here is fair at best. When we walked up to the front entrance with our bags no one approached us to help us in. The three bellmen simply stood there and talked amongst themselves. Wow, what a change from the W where we were constantly being helped or greeted.

She loved the pool, although I wished there was at least a small shallow end for my sanity's sake, and she loved pushing the elevator buttons. The fact that we could get on the Metro from the lobby was also a plus since it meant less walking through traffic. The concierge was incredibly nice and helpful in identifying age-appropriate activities for us, and the room service was delivered relatively quickly, and I received a follow-up call to make sure everything was as ordered. When I called the front desk to ask about a DVD player to connect to the room tv, he was polite and honest and apologized when he told me the rental price was more than what it would cost to buy a new one. (Note: bring your own portable DVD player). The only weak link was the housekeeping staff who took over an hour to bring an extra blanket, but that may have been that one staff member.

Five of the eight nights we were there were in Montreal at this Marriott. We were upgraded to the 31st floor with a spectacular lofty view of the city (my Wife stays at lots of Marriotts) This is a very busy Marriott, and as another reviewer recently noted - they host high school functions, which can make it even busier. Access to downtown Montreal is great from this Marriott - there is a Metro station directly underneath it, and you can get into the \"underground\" through the Metro station. In fact, for those travellers who really want to know how to get back to the Marriott through the underground , I'd recommend starting from the Marriott instead of trying to find your way back to it from somewhere else in the city ! We had both great and so-so service from the staff at this hotel. While the concierges are generally friendly (and bilingual) , we did encounter one with \"L'attitude\". She seemed to be just too busy to help. On the flip side, we had a server in the restaurant one morning who was fantastic. We were in Montreal for Canada Day (July 1st) and enjoyed the wonderful Canadian festivities, including a great parade. Most of the Montreal locals we met were super friendly. While there we saw the gargantuan botanical gardens and insectarium - both of which were fun and interesting. We also brought our rollerblades as we heard about good biking/rollerblading in the city. We went out to I'sle Notre Dame to the formula one track via twice during our visit for rollerblading. The first time we skated from the waterfront along the LaChine Canal trail - this was a mistake as the trail is rather hazardous on blades (it would be fine on a bike). The pavement is uneven in some section and the bridges are downright dangerous. We found that taking the Metro to/from the island was the way to go. You can board right under the Marriott on the Orange line, switch to the yellow line and it's the next stop. About a 30 minute ride including switching trains. Rollerblading on the track was a unique experience - you've just got to be careful of the bikers who are blazing past. The Montreal Casino is on this island too - probably the cleanest Casino I've ever seen , both inside and outside. I don't think smoking is permitted. The gardens on the outside of the Casino are immaculate. We also went to the Montreal Jazz Festival during our vist which runs the first two weeks in July. Saw Jamie Cullum and Chris Botti at La Place des Arts. Both concerts were great. The free concerts were fine too - although be prepared to stand. Just an FYI - the Place des Arts is accessible via the Metro and through the underground if the weather isn't good. We ate at several restaurants during our stay. The 3 Brassileurs (?) restaurants around town are a dependable lunch spot as are the many cafes in the old city. We also ate one night at La Montee (de Lait) which was much more expensive than I ever imagined for such little food. The presentation was elegant and it was probably one of the trendiest restuarants we've ever visited. In general be prepared to spend $60 - $80 USD on an inexpensive meal at any restaurant in town, and $120 - $200 (and up) at some of the really swank places.

The only problem was some form of static electricity in some of the pillows, don't know how it came but some of the pillows where loaded with static electrity creating \"nice\" tiny blue sparks in the night. The room itself was more then spacious enough and had a nice desk wich I used to work with my laptop. Free internet was also provided and had a decent speed. The badroom was rather small but also very clean. Yes, it is showing it's age but as long if everything is clean and decent maintained I really don't bother that the shower sheet is a sheet somewhere from the past decade... Water was hot and had a decent pressure (sometimes a problem on higher rooms). Also the restaurants had nice food. Not to cheap but it was definately worth the money. To end this review I definately would stay again at the Marriot Chateau Champlain when visiting Montr\u00c3\u00a9al in the next years.

My favorite part: the hotel is located above a subway station. Not that you heard noise, but it was easy to jump on the elevator and get on the train without having to go outside. Montreal has a subway system that is as good as the Paris system and better than NYC's. Getting around the city from this hotel is so, so easy. The view from the room was very nice. The windows curve outward, so you get more view that you would ordinarily get. You can see a full 180 degrees. The bathroom, TV and electronics have been recently updated.

Overall, everyone was fantastic. The room was wonderful & super comfortable. The staff was helpful and the connection to the metro was great for getting around town. Unfortunately it only takes one to ruin it for all. The last night we came back to the hotel for dinner b/c of an early departure the next morning. We arrived before all of the Hockey people from the game on purpose. There were a few other patrons in the hotel bar. The server, Marc, came over 5 times to take our drink order, and managed to only bring 2 drinks for 3 people. He seemed to think it was funny. We politely reminded him, and no drink. He even left his server tray on our table for over an hour. We specifically told him we were VERY hungry. He took our order 3 times, along with us reminding him that we still needed our 3rd drink after sitting there for 30 minutes. We ordered 2 club sandwiches and 2 French Onion Soups. We never received our 3rd drink. We sat for over an hour and never received our food. We had to go to the bar to order more drinks. Finally another table in our area complained and got a manager. She proceeded to attempt to assist the tables, but did nothing except take complaints. The place proceeded to get packed and every table had issues with Marc. One table told him to his face and he laughed at them. The manager finally brought us our food an hour and 1/2 after we had ordered it and the food was cold. We sat for another 30 minutes before she brought us our food back and brought us the same food from before after it had been sitting under a hot lamp for that 30 mintues. My sandwich had a bite out of it, that I had not taken, therefore she had served me my friend's sandwich. When I pointed it out to her in regards to being concerned that I hadn't be served someone else's food or a JOKE, she said, \"yes, this was the same plates and food that I served to you before.\" She never offered anything to make up for the ridiculous service except for a round of drinks. She brought us our tab, and we had been incorrectly charged for our meal in that we had been charged for drinks that Marc nor the manager never brought us. While we sat with our cold food, Marc also came by and proceeded to try to be cute again. We politely asked him to walk away, and he kept on poking at our food and plates and made the comment, \"Well I guess you will just have to sit there longer, huh?\" We left the bar and went to the front desk to complain since the manager had continued to fail at providing proper service and managing the situation. Meanwhile, all of the patrons on the side of the bar where Marc was working LEFT the bar. The front desk handed us a complaint card and did nothing about it. The also did not correct our bill from the bar where we were incorrectly charged for our meal and beverages. The front desk person seemed completely fake in concern for the matter. If you have a MAJOR business such as the NHL coming into town, would you not be sure to have your most quality staff on hand? I can't imagine a hotel letting something like that take place with regular business. We had been in the hotel bar the afternoon before, and the service was fantastic. We even asked the manager if it was some sort of joke with the way everything went for us, & she said that she didn't know what was going on with Marc, but that everyone had complained. What king of manager lets that kind of server stay on the floor and run people off?

But the bathroom was tiny (like Red Roof Inn tiny) and the design of the rooms is very late-70s like. I also had a complimentary breakfast in their restaurant and although the buffet quality was good, the manager seemed very stern to his staff and from overhearing conversations between staff members and guests, morale is pretty poor.

Though not perfect under a few minor aspects, its general quality definitely outweighs those little flaws. PROS: Views : Every room is equipped with a semicircular kind of bay window (without partitions), which provides STUNNING views of Montreal's skyline. Should you elect to stay at this hotel, indulge yourself and request a room on higher floors. This single feature is worth the price you will be paying. Location : Close to everything. Just grab your shoes and walk to virtually any interesting spot in the city. Also - and this is not a minor advantage - the hotel is linked to the metro, Place du Canada, the CN train station, Place Ville-Marie (one of Montreal's highest skyscrapers) and Place Bonaventure. Only few other hotels in Montreal are directly linked to a metro station and so many shopping centers. Furnishing / decor : Some like it traditional. This is my case, and if it is yours too, then go along with the Marriott Chateau Champlain. Upon entering the hotel, you are greeted by an inviting, spacious and classy hall. So are the rooms, except for the spacious attribute. I got a room which I guess is considered as basic. Nevertheless, its furnishing was on par with North America's highest standards. Overall, the room itself was in a state of perfect cleanliness, smelled incredibly good and looked very elegant. As Marriott got us used to, their new beds are sublime. Every room features a spacious walk-in with lots of drawers. This contributes to reducing the size of the room itself, but is undeniably useful. Service : Bellboys are incredibly efficient with luggage. The vast majority of staff members I encountered were obliging and competent. Still remains some exceptions (see cons). The maid service was flawless. I cannot comment on room service since I did not use it (same for valets). Fully non-smoking property : I personally do not mind, but those who can not stand the smell of cigarette will be pleased with this hotel. If a guest ever smokes in his room, the hotel applies a 250$ penalty and closes the room for an intensive 1-day cleanup. I can not comment on the pool, but it looked fairly good at first glance. Still a few CONS: Size of the rooms : It is true that rooms are on the small side. I would say smaller than usual for this hotel category. For a party of more than two, I suspect that it would feel a little cramped. Bathrooms : Though their spotless cleanliness, bathrooms look overly outdated. I do not really care, do you ? On-site restaurant : The hotel restaurant (Samuel-de-Champlain) is stuffed in a large, dimly lit room with high ceiling and no windows. Food is okay, but prices do not reflect that. Service : Some of the staff members were either underperformant or too familiar. One night, there was a bartender who seemed to be fluent in no language known in North America. Plus, he made a weird comment on the beer brand we ordered. Excessive familiarity and lack of manners are not acceptable in such a property. On that particular aspect, the Ritz-Carlton is still way ahead of the Chateau. Here I will conclude with a special note for event organizers. This hotel is certainly a fairly decent choice for your next event in Montreal, but remain alert. Banquet managers are well intended, but some (not all) of their staff are severely lacking professionalism. In my personal experience, service was erratic, room charts were not always followed, Internet access was a nightmare and lighting / climate control was terrible. But overall, the Chateau Champlain is a wonderful place to spend some vacation time.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with great service\u201d", "Author": "Soundgirl2002", "ReviewID": "UR12989698", "Content": "Back in October a friend and I decided to make a quick weekend trip to Montr\u00c3\u00a9al for a Canadians hockey game and where looking for a hotel. That would be relatively close to the Bell Center and sights that we wanted to see, after doing some minor research on-line we came across the Marriot. The closeness of the hotel to the arena sold us instantly, along with being able to park in the garage for the weekend as we where driving in from New York. Once we arrived at the hotel check in was a breeze and the staff was very friendly. I had requested an upper floor room (as I had heard the view was the best from the upper floors which is definitely true, if your planning on staying their anytime soon definitely request this before you leave as you will not want to miss out.) and the hotel definitely gave us what we wanted placing us on one of the upper floors with an amazing view. The room its self was very spacious, comfortable and clean even with two double beds. The table had two very comfortable chairs to go along with it and was big enough for two laptop computers to sit on with out having to fight for space. Also their where plenty of outlets located through out the room so that we could not only keep the cell phones charged but also the computers up and running with out having to fight for a jack for either of them. The free wireless internet was also very nice to have available as it was very fast and reliable. For someone who needs to stay in touch with work through out the weekend while I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m away it was nice to not have to pay for this service for once. The television even had a great choice of programming to watch and this was a great way to settle down after a long day of sight seeing and hockey. Also we had purchased some beverages and snacks before entering the hotel (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll definitely want to do this as hotel beverages and snacks are quite pricey) and wanted to keep them cold. So once we arrived and got settled in I placed a call the front desk and requested a mini fridge and within 5 minuets doing so the hotel staff arrived with the fridge plus there was not extra charge for having it in the room. Another plus was the access to the Metro right under the hotel as it made getting around the city very easy, even though there is plenty to see within walking distance. After doing some minor exploring upon arrival we found that the quickest way to get to the Bell Center was not actually through the underground walk way but instead heading out the man doors of the hotel and to the left. Also the staff was very helpful when trying to find an inexpensive place to eat as they made several suggestions of really reasonable places to go. Check out when we were ready to leave was also very quick and easy.

You can either get on the train or walk into the \"underground city\" without ever going outside. - Front desk staff, room service, etc., spoke English well and did not make you feel bad for not speaking French. - The $14.00 shuttle from the airport stops directly in front of this hotel. Beats a $35+tip taxi ride. The only reason I did not rate it 5 star was the price of the room service and relative lack of affordable vending machines. In typical Marriott fashion, there is a bottle of water in the room that will run you $6.00 if you open. Vending machines were $2.00 for a can or small bottle. Room service food was good but again very overpriced. Fortunately I found a nearby pharmacy and bought $6.00 worth of beverage, which was 4 bottles the size of the $6.00 one in the room. Also there was a charge for local telephone calls that was not disclosed in the information contained in the room's information booklet. No comment on the parking as I did not bring a car.

We asked for foam pillows to replace the down and these were obtained for us within a few minutes of making the request.The first night we were there the people next door to us spent a 15-minute period slamming their door over and over (don't know what they were doing!) but after that everything was quiet and we couldn't hear any noises.

There were a few pleasant exceptions (Peter, the bell captain, was very nice and helpful), but overall, there were too many mistakes made and an unwillingness to correct the mistakes or problem-solve to find an acceptable solution. The tone was, \"like it or lump it\". Oh yes, the plumber who came to fix our toilet was very nice, too--although he couldn't completely fix it, he tried very hard and apologized for the inconvenience. The only good things about the hotel were the convenient location, the accessibility of the Metro from the hotel lobby, the abundance of pillows on the beds, the view of the city from our window, and the breakfast buffet. One server (I didn't get his name) is a waffle expert--he will make you a beautiful, delicious strawberry waffle as part of the buffet if you ask. If you do decide to stay here, make sure you say that you require a guarantee of the type of room you want (don't just request it, tell them that you want a confirmed guarantee) and be specific. Then make them stick to it when you arrive. Be persistent, be firm, and don't back down until you get the type of room you requested. It is exhausting, it is a hassle, but necessary. Also, make sure that if you require a non-smoking room, insist that the housekeeper not smoke in the room while s/he is making up the room. Also, make sure that if you lose something that if you contact lost and found and they say that they don't have it, don't take no for an answer. Contact housekeeping (apparently housekeeping doesn't always turn things into the lost and found) and if you still don't get help, find someone who is willing to go into the housekeeping office to look around for you--that is the only way we finally recovered our car keys. On second thought, if you stay here, just use the valet service for your car--it costs more, but then you'll have fewer hassles all the way around.

The hotel is centrally located in downtown Montreal, and we didn't have to leave the hotel to use the Metro trains as there is a subway station directly beneath the hotel.

It is hard to tell when the rooms were last re-done, but too long ago is part of the answer. There is mildew in the shower, about a dozen coats of paint on all painted surfaces and the wall paper in the bathroom has serious water damage. On the bright side, the wireless Internet access is well above average and free for the first night. It was difficult (read this a 10 minute discussion) to get the non-smoking room I'd reserved, however, the staff did finally seem to find one after I waited in line twice (front desk seemed understaffed for the number of rooms in this hotel). Service in the restaurant is also very slow (although polite); from what I could tell they had 2 servers for the entire venue and lots of impatient customers.

The towels are a mix bag collection of yellow, off-white, white, and some of the above with stains. Service is not what I would expect from a Marriott. Check-in clerk, bell men, and door men were all rude. Check-in clerk rolled her eyes when I asked her to put in my Rewards number into the reservation. How dare I forgot to put it in when I booked the room! I had a late flight leaving so I wanted to leave my bag at the bell desk. Both bell men in morning and afternoon shifts asked me to haul my own bag and put it onto the shelf in the luggage room. The door man was rude when asked how often the shuttle comes by. He screamed 20 minutes and wanted nothing more to do with me. Refused to tell me when the last one was here, told me to just wait at the curb. Definitely NOT worth the $200/night price tag.

We usually stay at 4-5 star hotels for our anniversary, so I was expecting a certain level of impressiveness at the Chateau Champlain, which is apparently a four star hotel. Unfortunately I was fairly disappointed. Firstly, in all fairness, I must mention that the staff are excellent. Everyone from the front desk team to the waitstaff to the bellmen to the cleaning maids themselves went out of their way to be friendly and provide top service. I have rarely encountered such remarkable staff in a hotel. There was nothing that they would not do for us. We had only to ask. Furthermore, it is quite convenient to everything. We walked EVERYWHERE with ease, and you can see the Marriott sign high up in the sky to orient yourself and find your way back to the hotel. The Metro is connected to the hotel, which was even better. But after visiting Montreal I noticed that pretty much *any* hotel, *anywhere* in the city was convenient. However, the hotel itself is in need of a major facelift. The showers (and I stayed in two rooms over the 4 days) functioned more like a harshly spraying garden hose than anything else. The worst showers, BAR NONE, that I have ever encountered (even in a 2 star hotel). The bathroom tiles, while clearly genuine marble, looked very old and yellowed. The toilets did not flush well, and a few of the yellowed towels stood out amongst the newer bright-white ones. Maybe this will not matter to you, but a luxurious bathroom is the most important sign, to me, that I have entered a high class hotel. The room itself looks much like a Holiday-Inn type of room. Nothing remarkable, but nothing real to complain about except a few stains on the ceiling and general wear and tear on furniture. The first room I was in lacked a working internet port, and the second room's socket failed half way through my stay when the entire outlet died for no reason that I could discern. All in all, nothing real to complain about, but apart from the service in the hotel we were left severely underwhelmed by the Chateau Champlain and will definitely not return.", "Date": "August 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cloved the hotel\u201d", "Author": "orangeIreland", "ReviewID": "UR3812125", "Content": "Just returned from a trip to Montreal,and stayed for 6 days in the Marriott Chateau Champlain, very friendley Staff, Did not try the pool, Room was very nice, and private, Breakfast was excellant, Loved the decor of the Hotel, Bar was nice, Food very good.
