{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Delightfull!!! Villa Sonia in Bali was a delightful place. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. For a few bucks, the staff would drive us to any restaurant for dinner, and a simple call would bring them back to pick us up! The breakfest delivered to your room at a time you specified was delicious!!! The pool was clean and refreshing. The room was clean and kept up with modern times. Mosquitos were not a problem, nor were bugs. Monkey Forest was indeed within walking distance, as were the shops. This was really a nice place to stay and we would be back if ever in Bali again!PS. The only downfall was the rooster in the early morning, but what the heck... you are in the middle of the jungle and by day two you barely heard him anymore... or we got used to it. It's not too often I get woken by a rooster, it was kind of cool.DonnaBartlett, Illinois, U.S.A.", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR435381494", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "donnawhalen2"}, {"Content": "Beautiful Villa sonia I am sad to read metal's reveiw. That was not my experience at all, completely the opposite in fact.I also stayed in the suite villa and it was divine- it is no Alila Ubud mind you, but it also doesn't cost $US450 a night to stay there! My room was clean, beautifully decorated and completely tranquil. I loved my outdoor shower with it's beautiful furns on the walls especially. I took the beautiful Balinese breakfast by the pool every morning, it was delicious and a good size serving. If you like coffee, you'll love the Balinese black coffee that comes with it.I did a full and a half day tour organised through the Villa, they also orgainsed two half days motorbike hire for me. I said I wanted a motorbike and one appeared before my eyes.The staff at Villa Sonia could not do enough for me. They went out of their way to make my stay as special and relaxing as they possibly could. Villa Sonia is very initmate and very hands on. If you want a resort where no-one could care if you were there or not, this is not the place for you. If you want to be pampered by the friendliest people I have come across in my travels, you'll love Villa Sonia.P.S The Bali Botanical Day Spa in Campuan is my pick. It is just as beautiful, it's cheap (you get way more than you pay for!) and they will pick you up and drop you at your hotel for free.", "Date": "May 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR735905657", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Quincie"}, {"Content": "Magnificent We arrived at reception without a booking and after inspection of theproperty negotiated a price of $80aud, promptly stayed for 5 gloriousnights. The suites are superb, beautiful garden bathrooms, huge canopy beds, massive verandah complete with a kitchen/bar plus seating and even a day bed overlooking a fish pond. Carefully plantedtropical gardens offer privacy, a mini bar replenished daily at street prices and even red hibiscus on the pillows each day. A variedbreakfast was included served to the Villa, poolside or at a quaint dining/bar area overlooking a beautifully designed pool. Staff were very friendly and with a little care in asking, provided our every need including coffee every afternoon. The place is spotlessly maintained and offers total peace and tranquility while being within a 10 minute bike ride form the heart of Ubud. We have been to Bali about 18 times since 1982 and have stayed at aoruond 35 hotels aroundthe island, this boutique Villa Hotel offers great value for your money and I recommend it without hesitation.

The room was nice and decent to the price 85\u9227?- but we will never come back. Problems started when we tried to arrange for we would arrive one day before our booking. When i booked the room i was told they where fully booked, that was not true at all. I was quite a process to find one who could rebook our rates. There service level of the hotel is quite bad, you have to ask for everything several times, and still do a bit of praying. several things did return from the laundry, please be careful.When we stayed at Villa Sonia the pool was more or less impossible use due to the fact that one of the employees had put to many chemicals in, the excuses was lame, and there was no warning. One of us got chemical burns after half an hour in the pool.Cleaning was a bit of a bummer, as you ca see on the on my candid photo, there was an open bottle of bintang (local beer) next to the toilet. I stayed there for the full duration of our stay.We only tried the breakfast that was not good, and you really have to as for all the item, first morning we got a rather limited of the breakfast that was included. The first morning we got a rather strange combination on our platters, the next morning when we asked for what was written in their menu, the response was All that - The most efficient part of Vlla sonia was a rather large gekko, that did it best to eliminate the local bugs.", "Date": "Apr 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR720489237", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "metalstein"}, {"Content": "Villa Sonia Excellent place to be       our openair shower by Villa Sonia", "Date": "Sep 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR331079899", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gotobali"}, {"Content": "Villa Sonia We have been goint to Bali for about 14 years and have always stayed in Ubud. After a lot of research and visits to loads of hotels and other accomadation Villa Sonia meets all our needs It is situated just the other side of the Monkey Forest in a place called Nyuh Kuning. The gardens are pretty with a lovely green stone lined swimming pool and the accomadation is laid out in a series of 2 two storie Villas and you have either the upstairs or downstairs. The downstairs rooms are bigger with king size beds, AC, TV and marble floors. The bathroom is a good size with a huge sunken stone bath and an outside shower. In front of the room there is an ornimental pond with a raised seating area where your breakfast is brought to you.You also have a fridge ,cooker and sink with bar area. What we like about Villa Sonia is that it is very quiet, no barking dogs all night , no Honda 50s crackling past all day and no chickens waking up at 2.am . The staff are lovely and there is a car which will take you into town if you do not want to walk. We have stayed at places which are just beautiful until you find on day one that they also have all of the above! The web site does not realy do the place justice and we found it just by chance whilst going past on bicycles and have been back many times ,as with all accomadation in Bali the price listed on the web site is open to negotiation.They are also promoting Villa Sonia for long term stays ,with an appropriate deal on the price . So if you just want to get away from it all and write that book or calm your mind then this is the place to stay.", "Date": "Jan 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR516421685", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Jaggery"}, {"Content": "joli h\u4e48tel \"boutique\" de 6 chambres       Chambre deluxe n\u63b3 2", "Date": "Aug 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR652635172", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "DanyBelgium"}, {"Content": "Le Palais des Mille et une nuits   showReview(6170745, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR287091971", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bermart"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d503298-r18913968-Villa_Sonia-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "503298", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
