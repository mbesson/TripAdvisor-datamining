Ok, now that we've gotten that out of the way, I'd like to say that this is a clean, comfortable place to stay for people on a budget. I was in town on business, and I need to go 1 block to work on my project for a couple of days. The Holiday Inn Express of West LA filled a need for me with a convenient room and was just perfect. The staff was friendly and courteous, they had free Wi-Fi and a free breakfast, which if you just want instant oatmeal and a piece of fruit, works just fine. The bed was comfortable, although we were right next to the 405 freeway, so it was a little noisy. Bring your earplugs. The rooms also offered free HBO. Other than that, the grounds were NOT pretty...that's for sure. You can bet I wouldn't stay here on vacation.

First of all... it's not fancy. But it's a HIE, so you can't expect fancy. However, I was really surprised by the layout and exact location. It's literally on the corner of the 405 exit ramp and Santa Monica Blvd. AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE DURING RUSH HOUR. It took me an hour to travel ONE MILE on Santa Monica Blvd to get back to the hotel on a Thursday at 6:00 pm and if you turn the corner too fast, you'll miss your only chance to pull into the parking garage, forcing you to have to go around the block and back onto Santa Monica to wait in another 15 minutes of traffic to get back into the garage. Pretty hellacious. I know this isn't the hotel's fault, but if you're going to be driving to/from around that time, you may want to consider elsewhere. Also, the hotel looks like a parking garage that got converted into a hotel. The outside looks like a building, but the inside (walking to your room) is basically open/outdoors. It's very strange. It feels motel-ish and a bit unsecure. It really isn't unsafe, I suppose, but it just feels strange to technically be outside when you open the door to leave your room. Unfortunately, I had a room whose windows face the 405 freeway. It was odd to be on the third floor and just see an endless line of cars. Nothing really pretty to look at, noisy during heavy traffic hours and if I had thought of it, I might have requested an inward-facing room, rather than outward. Also, parking in the garage (which has the most convenient entrance to the hotel lobby, but gets locked after 9pm, charges $10 per day extra. A few of the pros are that the rooms are clean and they serve some sort of free breakfast in the mornings on the patio/atrium/whatever it's called. You're basically sitting outdoors, surrounded by the hotel walls. I had no issues staying here, but next time I will probably request to stay elsewhere.

As I had appointments two days in a row in the area, I decided to spend the night at the Holiday Inn Express off of Santa Monica Boulevard. The hotel is fine (although my room did not have a closet to hang clothes, odd). I agree with the breakfast reviews and, yes, ask for a room away from the freeway. I had Room 322. I woulld also suggest you stay off of the second floor as the breakfast area is located here. It is outside under a tent, so I would think noise could carry. They have a fan setting in the room, plus I always bring my white noise machine. I slept fine. The front desk clerk was very helpful. Now, about the area... 1) I could not figure out how to get into the hotel. Literally, you have to turn on a street called \"Beloit\" that looks like the freeway entrance to the 405 and make a quick right into the hotel. They told me they were going to charge $7 for parking per night, but when I checked out, it was not on my bill. 2) Yes, there are restaurants, a 7 -11, and a Subway within walking distance, but there are LOTS of homeless people. Did I feel it was dangerous? No, but it was creepy. 3) The traffic was horrific in West Los Angeles (Wilshire, Santa Monica Blvd). The nearby freeway location is actually good as it can take you more than 30 minutes to drive two miles to the 405. Also, if you want to go into Beverly Hills or Westwood (UCLA) to eat you will constantly be looking for parking and shelling out lots of money for it. In two days, I spent $33 to park in three different locations. 4) So, in summary, the hotel was fine for where it was located. It is the city of Los Angeles that is completely inept in not having any kind of comprehensive public transportation system for its citizens and visiiting tourists.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary", "Title": "\u201cThe worst hotel ever\u201d", "Author": "ttna", "ReviewID": "UR67917852", "Content": "This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

We loved going right next door to watch movies. There is a Subway sandwich place and 7-11 right across the street and a few decent restarants within one block. It was about 15 minutes to Hollywood Blvd and about 30 minutes to Universal Studios. Also, the Santa Monica pier is pretty close. This hotel is upgraded nicely for an older building. Although near a busy freeway on on a busy boulevard, I did not hear much traffic noise in the room. The room was a good size and I loved the built in benches along the wall by the window. I wish we could have opened the drape all the way but in only opens in the middle. The desk was a good size with a nice plug in on the top of the desk for your lap top and/or to plug in a phone charger, etc. The hotel also has free wi-fi but we could not get it to work in the room so our usb cable came in handy. The tv was decent, not huge but decent. It was great to have a fridge in the room but there was no microwave. The bathroom was pretty nice and clean. There were a few minor flaws that the front desk seemed happy to know about. I waited until our departure as they were really no big deal. The housekeeping staff did a great job cleaning the room. It was even clean under the beds! The worst part of this place was the breakfast. We had to scrape the cheese sauce out of the mini-omelettes as it tasted like a bad copy of the cheese they use in kraft mac and cheese and it was very watery. The day they has scrambled eggs, they were super salty. The room is very cramped so it is hard to get your food if there are more than two people in there. The eating area is spacious but outside under a tent like area. The only fruit they had were bananas. They also had ok cinnamon rolls, toast and bagels, cereals, juices and coffee. On the day they had scrambled eggs they also had biscuits and gravy. On the omlette day they had sausages. I guess it was ok, but really they should omit the cheese sauce as it was probably the worst I have ever had. I never checked out the fitness room and there was not hot tub. But the desk help was excellent and they helped me right away with my requests every time I called them.

The rooms are nice, clean and modern, with a very comfortable bed, and spotless, spacious bathroom. There was a refrigerator which is always convenient.

There is a free 'express breakfast' in a central courtyard which is nice to have, a selection of yogurt, pastries, cereal and a couple hot items like eggs and bacon or sausage. Wish they had a little more fresh fruit there besides bananas. The rooms come off an open courtyard, so be aware that you may be exposed to the elements a little when you go to your room and to the covered breakfast area (we had bad rainstorms that week.) The free parking in a small underground garage is a real plus, because it's so much easier to go in and out at your leisure instead of waiting for valets and worrying about tipping and fees. The location is a bit unattractive, on a stretch of drab commercial roadway, but it's right off the 405 freeway which makes it great for driving off to other locations. (The Westfield Century City mall is convenient, only 2 miles east down Santa Monica Blvd.) There is some road noise given its location but you can try to request a room that faces towards a parking lot in back instead of the main street. The walls were a bit thin so you could hear doors slamming and some talking; but one great option is to turn on the low fan on the wall heating/cooling unit.

Getting to Universal was easy too. The taxi cost $50 one way. And we got the metro and bus back and it cost $2.50 each. Breakfast was fruit/ porridge/ pastry/ cereal and quite good.

That's especially true on the Westside. Having said that, there is one option that is actually a gem in the rough--Holiday Inn Express West Los Angeles. The West Los Angeles location is ideally located on Santa Monica Blvd and the infamous I-405 freeway. It's the perfect jump-off point if you are planning on driving. There is abundant subtarranean parking below the hotel with the rooms located on floors two through four. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. It was just me and the size was perfect. Two people would do as well too. The room was standard equipped with a very comfortable queen size bed, a desk for work or surfing the Net, high-speed Internet connection, if you have your laptop with you, TV with cable, a coffee set-up to brew your own and a good size individual refrigerator. I asked for a non-smoking room. The bathroom was a nicely designed, modern granite bathroom. It was nicer than some of the 'higher end' hotels I have ever been to. The hotel serves a continental breakfast each morning from 6:30 to 9:30 AM. For a continental breakfast, they serve a surprisingly varied number of items. In addition to the standard juices, they have bagels with cream cheese, hot cinnamon rolls, muffins, fruit, make your own oatmeal, hardboiled eggs and coffee. Those are what I ate. There were other things but I never got around to a second helping! The one downside....this intersention is notorious for traffic because of people getting on the 405, getting off and through traffic going to Century City, Westwood, UCLA or Beverly Hills. The building has clearly been soundproofed but you DO hear the traffic in your room during rush hour. It's not bad but if you were looking for a completely 'silent' room, this wouldn't be it. There are several benefits to this location: This area has a wide array of restaurants all within walking distance or a short bus ride away. Around the corner and 4 blocks South on Sawtelle Blvd is an area littered with Japanese restaurants, stores and markets. It's sometimes affectionately known as \"Little Tokyo West.\" There is a multitude of restaurants including ramen houses, sushi bars and Japanese fusion houses. Stand outs include: Manpuku (Japanese/Korean BBQ) and Chabuya (ramen). By no means are these the only standout places! West L.A. is also littered with wonderful Persian restaurants. Westwood Blvd between Santa Monica and Wilshire Blvd is sometimes annointed \"Little Persia\" for its multitude of Persian restaurants, markets, book stores and other types of related entities. You don't need to speak Farsi to browse these stores. All people are heartily welcomed to walk around. Stand out restaurants include: Shahrzad Restaurant (Westwood Blvd near Ohio), Darya (Santa Monica Blvd near Bundy) and Javan (3 blocks West of hotel). There are many more. Other locations for a multitude of restaurants include Westwood Village, Century City Shopping Center, Pico Blvd between Overland and Veteran, and Santa Monica Blvd West of the hotel are among the areas with large concentrations of restaurants. The hotel location is also well suited for those that want to get out of their cars and take the bus. Parking is very expensive in L.A. and the notorious congestion goes without saying. There are several bus lines, however, that'll take you to a lot of the major destinations: Santa Monica Big Blue Bus Line #1 East goes up Santa Monica Blvd and then takes you to Westwood Blvd, Westwood Village, UCLA-Armand Hammer Museum and UCLA. Santa Monica Big Blue Bus Line #1 West goes down Santa Monica Blvd tp Downtown Santa Monica, Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Beach/Pier and Venice Beach/Boardwalk. MTA Metro Bus #4 East to Wilshire Blvd. Catch a connecting bus MTA Rapid #720 or MTA Metro Bus #20 up Wilshire to Fairfax Blvd. This is the start of Museum Row and the Peterson Automotive Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), George C Page Museum/La Brea Tar Pits, Craft and Folk Art Museum. So, in addition to being a very nice and comfortable hotel, the Holiday Inn Express West Los Angeles is nicely situated at a crossroads of sorts to many of Los Angeles' most popular destinations. This review only covered a few of many throughout this region.

It's just off the 405, so getting there was a snap. UCLA is about 10-15 minutes away, depending on where you're going. (Driving, not walking.) Despite being just off the freeway, noise was no problem. I think it's double-glazed, and the aircon covers the little sound that gets through. I was pleasantly surprised by the room. It's a comfortable size, furnished with stylish modern built-in furniture, including a nice, functional desk. The beds were firm and comfortable. It was clean and well-maintained. The bathroom looked refurbished, with granite, tile, new shower-curtain, and Kohler fittings. From a practical standpoint: There is no closet and nowhere to hang a suit. I used the second queen-size bed in my room to lay out all the clothes that I would have hung up. There are big drawers under the TV set, good for clothes that can be folded. Unfortunately, they have been installed such that they tend to open if they're loaded. And I had to unplug a light to use the plug-point near my bed. Next time, I might bring a couple of hangers and some over-the door hooks. And maybe an ethernet cable, in case I get a room with bad wi-fi. And an extension cord. They had ample free parking in an underground lot with secure elevator access. The lobby is spartan, but the reception was pleasant. They told me I might need an ethernet cable but they were all out. As it turned out, in my room near the elevator, the wi-fi worked fine. They had coffee in the room and the lobby and a convenient junk-food/ water/ soda machine on each floor. I'd planned to stay at Hilgard House for this trip to UCLA, but they were sold out. They very kindly referred me to a few other hotels, including this one. I read the reviews, and found they were pretty favorable, so I booked it. On the whole, I was happy with this hotel. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNot so bad\u201d", "Author": "NYCroadtrip", "ReviewID": "UR10056784", "Content": "We stayed here for a week, and have stayed at dozens of Holiday Inn Expresses around the country.

If you're not from the area, this is like having a motel above the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. As I passed by this hotel, it appeared to be a very tall and thin building, constructed so that you would see the most of it from the fwy - and guess what, that their guests would get the most noise from the fwy. I notice the picture above has the fwy airbrushed out. Seeing as how this is the busiest fwy in LA, now being widened to 10 lanes, I'm not sure this is a \"small detail\" that it is OK to not mention. I have not stayed at this place - I wouldn't do it for $3000. I just imagine getting a room next to the fwy and horns waking me at 5:00 AM, or ealier, when I have a big presentation to give the next day. I also think of the many experiences I have in bad motels elsewhere: The A/C is too loud to sleep with, but when you open the window, some other noise makes it too loud to sleep that way. If you want to stay there, ask them if they will guarantee a quiet room and A/C, and back the guarantee with promise of a cash refund. Maybe they have great soundproofing and super-quiet A/C - I don't know. It just seems to me, the idea of building a hotel next to, and I mean immediately next to, the busiest fwy and onramp anywhere is just so nakedly uncaring, even contemptuous of guests, it is just unimaginable to me. I have no idea what Holiday Inn was thinking, or how they can live with themselves pulling something like this. If you do stay here, please please report back in detail on the noise.

I would have given this a 4-5 star review if management had not unceremoniously yanked the hotel general manager - Rodney. As a 20-year traveler for business who has stayed at many a Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, etc, I was amazed at the level of attentiveness that Rodney showed on guests. After the first visit, he knew my name on site. I watched how he handled guest, made the hotel run smooth. Holiday Inn took over the hotel early in '06 from Best Western, and I suppose there was some mid-level corporate flak who decided he knew what was best - but boy did they blow it here.
