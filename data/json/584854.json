The only advantage of this hotel is the location as it was very easy to access all parts of Singapore from here and there were plenty of places to eat outside within walking distance. Even though it was classed as being in the red light district there was a mosque a few minutes walk from the hotel. It was slightly noisy at night but this was expected as there are a few nightclubs in this road, however it felt very safe there as the reception was constantly manned. The free wifi offer is very deceiving as once connected it would kick you out after a couple of minutes and you would have to sign in again which was very frustrating. Also we had to request a password every day which again was very frustrating. The hotel is very basic with no frills attached, however if you have a chance you should stay in Malaysia just across the border in Johor Bahru as what you pay for budget hotel accommodation in Singapore, for less that the price of this hotel you would get a far better deal in Malaysia i.e. breakfast, larger room and a view.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuttgart, Germany", "Title": "\u201cSmall and a little bit run down\u201d", "Author": "Lars1975", "ReviewID": "UR126200290", "Content": "Stayed there for just a night between arrival from Phnom Penh and going to a Malaysian Island.

Little did we know what we were getting ourselves in for!! Upon check is, we hear a loud argument, then a lady half naked runs into the lobby arguing with a man about 'payment'. Check in staff barely flinched at the commotion indicating this sort of event is normal. Trying to avoid eye contact with the lady and man, I looked at the wall and saw that rooms could be rented by the hour... this was not on the Expedia website when I booked! As we were only here for a few hours, and were exhausted from travelling, we went upstairs to our room, which STUNK of cigarettes. When we called down to reception, we were told that all rooms are non-smoking (yeah right?!?) and that the only other room available was on the ground floor next to the arguing couple.

View from the window reminds me of a depressing labour class area, with nothing to look forward to. The other hotels in this area are even worse, as they have blinded / no windows, because the prostitution scene here doesn't really appreciate views / viewers.

Lots of pubs though. 3) Situated in Geylang (red light district), so late night, you can see a lot of women around. 4) For Indians specifically, no indian eateries around this place. 5) not enough space in the room, but then it does not really matter, as you are not going to spend the day in the room. 6) You have got to call the reception for managing the AC temperature.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cBudget Hotel needs some work\u201d", "Author": "ragged_ann", "ReviewID": "UR114820892", "Content": "I had an unplanned overnight stay in Singapore due to an issue with long haul flight from UK to New Zealand, as a consequence this hotel was booked at the last minute. Hotel 81 Sakura was fine for what I needed, a clean bed with a shower, I wasnt expecting much considering the price I paid (booked through Expedia) and needless to say my expectations were spot on. The bathroom needed regrouting, the aircon needs to be replaced and a deep clean wouldn't go amiss. A shower curtain would be really beneficial!! The floor got very wet!! Note that I slept late in the morning and there didnt seem to be any hot water, perchance early risers bet me to the hot water?? The reception area was very nice and the staff were helpful, especially the gentleman who checked me out in the morning, gave me advice on local area as well as advising on best form of transport back to the airport (it cost me SD$10.80 hailing a cab outside hotel) I didn't feel the safest in the area at night (single female traveller!!) but was completely at ease during the day! The food in the street is amazing and the locals very friendly!! Check out Geylang Serai food court for some treats!

My partner had booked this room against my better judgement, as I had previously had a negative experience at another Hotel 81 Hotel (Hollywood). I should have listened to my head on this... This was touted as being one of the newer Hotels in this chain and certainly the decor was better than my last experience. However the room was so small we could barely fit our luggage into the room, the shower was situated so that if you didn't close the bathroom door, water went straight into the bedroom area, and the walls were very thin. We were kept awake for many hours by the noise coming from an adjacent room. I finally complained, and the noise slowly abated. Beware...Hotel 81 chain are designed for ultra-budget travelers. There isn't a lot of love in these rooms, location, or outlook, and Management is disinterested in taking this to the Owners. If you are a budget traveler then you would be better considering one of the newer Singapore Hostels, which offer as good or better facilities, for less money.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel 81 - Sakura", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d584854-Reviews-Hotel_81_Sakura-Singapore.html", "Price": "$58 - $103*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">181 Joo Chiat Rd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">427452</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "584854", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/99/78/9978cbe7c6819f89887049da3eb31d442large.jpg"}}
