Rome is a jaw dropping city so we opted for a cheap hotel on the outskirts with the premise that we'd be out exploring most of the time. Our room was just what we needed:a comfy bed, good aircon, tv with a couple of English channels and a clean bathroom. No frills just basics and it could do with a facelift as the carpet and walls were a bit tired. They were doing a gradual refurb so I'm sure the rooms will be smartened up by now, they were adequate for us anyway. The bar, breakfast room and reception had already been returned and were very modern and clean looking. Breakfast was great considering the price. Fresh bread, spreads, cold cuts, hot drinks and pastries as well as cereal and fruit. Perfect to stock you up for a tough day of sightseeing! The best thing for me about this hotel was the roof terrace! As we travelled in August it was screaming hot by lunchtime. So we'd get up and have an early breakfast, was into town (a short bus ride to the tube and 10mins On tube) get some sights seen as have an early lunch when it started to get hot. Then mid afternoon we'd return to the hotel for a nap and some air con before showering and basking on the roof top terrace watching the sunset and returning to town for the evening. Rome is amazing and a totally different city from morning to night.

While the rooms were dated and the bathroom even more so (but it had a bathtub), the service and other amenities made up for it. I'll start with my room. While it showed some signs of aging (i.e. tube TV, some rust/scratches), keep in mind that most European hotels can't offer the same amount of \"newness\" as American hotels offer without a complete renovation, since most American hotels are newer and are members of much larger chains. The beds were very comfortable and clean. There was a large closet in the entryway. The room was equipped with international plug outlets, a huge plus in my book. The bathroom was the only downside - it was one of the notorious \"un-renovated\" bathrooms with old tile (some of it missing), an ancient hairdryer, and extreme signs of age. The door to the bathroom wouldn't lock, but I didn't find this to be an issue. I actually like this bathroom more than the renovated bathrooms, as it had a bathtub (the only one I saw out of 4 hotels) and was pretty spacious. My favorite part of my room was the balcony. Not all the rooms in the hotel have a balcony; only rooms on the front side do. While it was aged (some rust), my balcony offered wonderful views of Rome. Overall, the room was great. For a mid-sized hotel, Raganelli offered quite a few amenities, including a large fitness center (in a separate building next to the hotel) and free breakfast. My favorite amenity was the roof garden, which offered a 360 degree view of Rome and a great place to relax and hang out with friends. I was very impressed! While most European hotels make you pay for more \"hearty\" breakfast food, Raganelli offered a wonderful breakfast that inlcuded pepperoni, salami, cheese, yogurt, cereal, assorted breads, pastries, pound cake, amazing coffee, and much, much more. Raganelli Hotel also offers an American bar and wireless internet (for an additional fee). During my stay, the front desk staff was very friendly and did everything to satisfy your personal requests. I was very impressed with the hotel's main lobby. It was huge and had many meeting places for guests. There was modern, relaxing music playing and a large plasma TV was playing Italian TV shows. The overall mood and decoration of the lobby was very modern (I loved the design).

Took taxi from airport to Hotel - cost 53Euro. We thought ok between 4. Hotel staff (apart from one) friendly and spoke good English. Rooms could do with a freshen up, but clean and bed comfortable. Toilet had recently been refurbished and we had a walk in shower. Breakfasts plentiful. Cold ham, salami and slices of cheese. Bread, different types of bread roll, toaster, 3 or 4 different types of cerial, fresh milk, juices, coffee, tea bags (all types), yoghurt. Jams and spreads. Danish and croisants. We were at the front of the hotel and noisy from traffic, but we coped. Take No 247 bus (stop across the road) to metro about 4 stops away, then metro line A to most of the attractions. Spagna is the stop for Spannish Steps, stop next to that is for Trevi Fountain but easy walk from Spannish Steps. 4Euro a day for bus/metro/tram ticket. Take 246 bus back to hotel (again stop just outside) and you would catch the bus just outside a Macdonalds. Metro stop across the road from that. Buses ran about every 15 minutes and we never had to wait more than 7 or 8 minutes for one. Bar quite nice, you have to get reception staff to come and serve you. 6Euro for G&T and I think 5 for Peroni beer. Got hotel to book a taxi for us back to airport and paid hotel 65Euro, however taxi driver had his meter on and had we got the taxi ourselves, it would have been just under 40. However we were leaving the hotel at 7.30 in the morning and didn't want to risk not being able to get one at that time in the morning by just flagging one down. Come out of hotel and turn left you will come to a tobaconist - buy your transport tickets there. Go further down and you will come to a restaurant - not recommended. The one next door to it with glass fronts is much better and not bad prices. 3Euro to use internet at hotel for half hour. Handy to have to check flights due to volcanic ash distruptions.

But in hindsight, I think we were lucky with this place. We were lucky with respect to the public transport, and while the room was very basic, we had an okay stay. The hotel is being refurbished, so it might be really good once all rooms are renovated. Positives: + Buffet breakfast was excellent. Probably one of the best we've come across on our travels through Europe. Cereals were available, toast and a nice assortment of croissants and breads. Cheeses and meats were available as well. We enjoyed making the most of this as the start to our days in Rome. + Service was really helpful and kind to us. We were going to book our tour through a local travel agent, but did it at the hotel instead. We were glad we did this as this ensured a complementary pick up and drop off to the hotel. We had to get up very very early for that tour, and the gentleman at the front desk quickly went down stairs and set up breakfast (which probably wasn't his job) an hour ahead of time for us and a few of the other guests. Were expecting to go to the tour without breakfast. Also, we were helped with our bags to the taxi out of the hotel. + On arrival, they give you a small tourist book of Rome, which is a nice thing to read to get to know what to see and do in Rome. + There was a great restaurant nearby, a pizza and pasta place. As a tip, we enjoyed buying a pizza, take away, avoiding a service charge to sit and took it back to the hotel. + There is also a supermarket a 5 to 10 minute walk down the hill. Depending on what you buy, bringing it back up the hill was okay for us. + We were happy to stay in Rome with the price that we paid. Negatives: - As other reviews have mentioned, we did have to rely on a combination of bus and metro (bus stop 1 minute away from Hotel). However, we had really good luck in this respect, because we never had to wait long for the 247, which takes you to the vatican city, or the 246, which takes you to Cornelia metro station, from which it's easy to get to where you want to go. The front desk is quite helpful when it comes to which bus to catch. If you're pretty mobile and flexible, the public transport is manageable. As a tip, it's good to make sure you get a 1, 2 or 3 day metro/bus pass if you're staying here. On arrival, knowing that getting here wasn't so easy, we planned to catch a cab, but in the end it was easier for us to take our luggage on to the bus than to walk around with it looking for a cab. - Our room was very basic, with a bed, old television, tired old floors and bathroom. There were paper thin walls, we had a group of inconsiderate guests and could hear them at 1am when they arrived. Also, we could hear the toilet flushes from the rooms around us from time to time. Overall, it wasn't the cleanest place we've stayed - Our bathroom was very old and squashy. If you're a generously sized individual, it's going to be tough to get around the cramped bathroom. - Wireless internet was not a free service, but at least it was reasonably priced. You may even try negotiating a slight discount which is what we did to get it at half the price for our whole stay. Overall, not the best stay in the world we've ever had, but it served it's purpose in allowing us to explore Rome.

Let's start with the cons. The quality of the room was a little bit subpar. The furnitures looked a bit old, the painting would have deserved some makeover and the air-conditionning was not easily tuned. Then here are the pros, and they are genuinely outstanding. The room was clean, large, and I soon felt comfortable. The help desk, really helpful and kind, did whatever they could to fix and help. The help desk has the most helpful and nice people you can find. The breakfast is ok. And: for a tourist having to come with her or his car, Rome is hell. Finding a off-street parking for your car is nothing but a challenge, and public parking lots are expensive. But the Raganelli hotel provides you with a free parking lot that you can use at your own discretion, and considering the 10+ lots, you are likely not to have any trouble to find one at any time you come. In addition the bus line is across the street. It commutes to the subway. It means that in about 30mn or 40mn you are downtown at the very centre of Rome. Only drawback: the last bus back to the hotel was at 10pm, and since the neighborhood was a bit sad, I prefered be back in time. To sum up, if a tourist comes with her or his car and is looking for correct rooms with helpful services, she or he should consider the Raganelli's as the best place to leave the car and enjoy Rome by public transportation, without the hell of wondering about parking.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot that great a place\u201d", "Author": "DoobyUK", "ReviewID": "UR18172288", "Content": "We've just returned from a great long weekend in Rome.

This was our first trip to Rome and we were looking forward to being complete tourists for the week !!! As the hotel does not offer a shuttle collection from the airport we had to use the train to Termini station, then get the Metro Line A to Cornelia and then find the 246 bus stop. Those of you choosing this method, at the time of writing this the train fare was 11 Euro one way each and the Metro was about 5 euro for the both of us but the ticket included the bus fare. The location of the bus stop is outside McDonalds ( take the left staircase when u leave Metro station) and be warned it is a VERY busy bus route and it gets extremely crowded. On arrival at the hotel ( 4 stops on the bus) the staff were very friendly and gave us a map of the city which proved invaluable, however once past the reception area the hotel takes on a dated and somewhat shabby appearance, and I must say the room was a disappointment. Although VERY clean the decor was definate '70's - the bathroom door was cracked and slightly warped, the bathroom fittings had lost most of the plating, the lampshades were old and battered no carpet on the floor and finally the wooden window frames had peeling paint and were cracking. The building DEFINATELY needs renovating - Oh yes one more thing - the room had external window shutters that if U lower them at night and there is anything like a stiff breeze blowing - they will rattle in their frames, if you are a light sleeper be warned. Breakfast is the same every day - ham, salami, cheese, cereals coffee juice croissant - which although filling we found by the end of the week we were longing for something cooked - good tip here though - if ur planning on walking and sightseeing make some sandwiches with the breakfast stuff - it can save you a fortune if ur a snack attacker like me !! The location of the hotel is fantastic with all major sights along or very close to Metro line A - we bought a weekly travel ticket for 16 euros each and it saved us money and was very convenient - U buy these at small newsagent units I think called tabccachini ( tobacco) shops. If you are planning a night out and intend travelling by public transport be aware that the Metro ceases to run at 9 pm!!!! buses are available but plan well ahead as the bus stops are not always easy to find. The stops do tell u what time the last bus is but not how often they run. The hotel does have a deal with a local taxi firm for a shuttle service back to the airport - it costs 50 euro but thats all in so if there are several of you travelling it can work out quite cheap. Would we go back to the Raganelli? A reserved yes - if the owners spent some cash on re decoration and the menu could be varied - but for location and friendliness of staff I dont think it can be beaten.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cits ok\u201d", "Author": "cjb222", "ReviewID": "UR8057484", "Content": "good staff. rooms small neeeding renovation. outside the centre of rome, not in a particulary attractive area.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCheap and it's in Rome\u201d", "Author": "londonxray", "ReviewID": "UR7834241", "Content": "Was sent here for one night because of \"a burst water pipe\" at my original hotel ( those pesky Italian water pipes again).

Great deal for budget travelling.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4694925", "Content": "So I'll start off with what seems like a popular topic-the location of the hotel. It is indeed about a 15 min walk to the Metro which is about a 15 min ride to the city center. The 30 min trip from the hotel to city center always seemed very quick. It was never a big deal for me because in Los Angeles the commute can easily be an hour or two. The buses worked out great as well. There was a bus stop directly across the street. They seemed to run about every 10 min so I never had a problem with it. The bus trip to the Vatican was about 15 minutes. I liked the fact that the hotel had free parking in a lot directly in front of the hotel only a few feet from the hotel entrance. This was great to park my rental car and not having to worry about my car or paying a lot of money to park my car somewhere. The neighborhood seemed to be a very quiet residential area although the street the hotel is on is a major street that leads into the Rome city center. I found the location to be great being only a 20 minute drive from Da Vinci airport. When I first saw the room my first impression was you get what you pay for. The bed was comfy and there was a small color t.v. mounted on the wall. The staff was fantastic. Always greeting you when you entered and exited the hotel. They give you a map and tell you how to get into the city. But the greatest thing that I loved about the staff was that one night I came back to the hotel and was starving. The person at the front desk offered and made me four ham & cheese sandwiches and a couple orange marmalade crossaints. It was outstanding!!! The breakfast was simple but free which is a nice way to start off the day. The hotel has a rooftop terrace with a beautiful view of the surrounding area, which is a great place to relax for a few minutes. Anyhow, to sum up the whole experience-the location was decent-the price per night to stay at the hotel was fantastically low-the staff was superb-the room is simple...a bed, a couple lamps, a small bathroom, and a small television. But for such a low low rate per night, what more can you ask for. I could and would definitely not mind staying here again if my travels should bring me back to Rome.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTired but comfortable\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4373888", "Content": "Very pleasant stay, rooms large, very clean but 'tired'.

The reception area was nice and the staff friendly, though, and we kept our fingers crossed that the room would also be ok. Well, it was shabby and tired, but very clean. The bathroom was a bit of a disgrace, damp patches everywhere, shower leaks all the way to the door, wires and pipes exposed, etc, and I don't think we ever got a succesful flush on the first attempt! However, water was hot, pressure fine, what more do you need in a hotel room when you're paying a \"budget\" price (although we hadn't realised that \u00a380 a night was \"budget\" in Rome!). As said often enough here, the location is the problem. The Vatican is a 20 min journey on the bus, and the bus to the Metro takes 10 - 15 min (then another 10-15min on the Metro itself). But we were waiting sometimes up to an hour for the bus to arrive. This means 2-3 hours a day are lost to travel time - you have to decide whether it's worth paying an extra \u00a330 - \u00a350 a night for something more central, or lose those hours every day. There isn't any chance to come back to the hotel to rest and freshen up before going back out for dinner. When you go out in the morning you need to have your full day's kit, go to dinner as soon as the attractions shut (6.30ish in October), then back to the hotel, exhausted, usually by about 10pm - not very romantic. The area the hotel is in isn't very nice, and the \"restaurant\" is open only for breakfast. Oh yes, the Metro had shut at 9pm so we had to pay for a taxi back anyway - 20 Euro I'd rather have spent on a more convenient hotel. Lastly, breakfast was reasonable and plentiful (fresh fruit and very fresh rolls, danish's, cereal, meats and cheeses). Would I stay again? No, would rather pay more for a better location and standard.
