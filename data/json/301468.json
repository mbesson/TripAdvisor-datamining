Since its renovation a few years ago, this hotel has the standards you'd expect in Singapore and it's not always too full of weddings or functions.

Best rooms are those that face the city (with views of the Marina Bay Sands hotel) or over the pool toward the sea (which I have this trip). The views are unobstructed so any floor is good. The best part of the hotel is the staff - incredibly helpful, somehow know my name at every contact point, and perfect service. Morton's Bar is fun (go for happy hour and try the filet sandwiches), Melt has a very good breakfast (to support the views of other commenters, it's not cheap), and the lounge facing the city has good music on the weekends.

We booked the Mandarin Oriental because it had such a good Tripadvisor rating. Having stayed there we can't understand why it's so highly rated. The place looks great and we did have a fantastic room on the 11th floor overlooking the sea. The bathroom was beautiful and all the staff we met were really attentive and friendly, especially the pool staff. This was the only hotel we stayed at which actually acknowledged that we were celebrating our honeymoon - but unfortunately our satisfaction stopped there. This is a very expensive hotel so it comes as a surprise to find that the hotel charges ridiculous fees for almost anything that you consume. Chief amongst these outrages is Wifi. I have a particular intolerance for hotels that charge for internet access and for the Mandarin to charge $10 PER HOUR for in-room wifi is despicable. Even our $40 a night bungalow on Gili Air threw in complimentary wifi. For the Mandarin to scrape together a few extra dollars by charging customers for internet access is indefensible. What's next - pay-as-you-go aircon? Even the business centre wasn't free. We spent a couple of hours at the pool and a quick glance at the menu revealed a similar enthusiasm for squeezing extra money out of guests - $30 for a sandwich! Our flight out of Singapore was not til 2330 but after discovering that a late checkout was charged at 50% of the nightly rate, we quickly realised that a late checkout at the Mandarin was only for those with an expense account to fall back on. Pretty shameful to charge that kind of money for a few extra hours in your room. Breakfast was not included in our room rate but we had heard good things so we decided to pay for it anyway. It was VERY good - a quite amazing choice and very good quality. However when we reviewed our bill on checkout, we found we had been charged $90 on day one and $110 on day two. It turns out we were charged for \"continental\" breakfast on day one because we'd arrived late, although no-one thought to tell us and we were not actually made aware on any occasion that there was even a continental option. This is poor practice and again gives the impression of maximising money-generating opportunities. Not a great image for what is supposed to be a luxury brand. Mandarin Oriental should take a leaf out of GHM's book - they offer proper luxury and treat their customers with respect. This is a decent enough place, heavily geared towards business travellers, but don't expect anything more for your money than a room with a bed. We paid upwards of $400 per night and we don't really understand what we got for all that money.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "basel", "Title": "\u201cvery nice view on skyline\u201d", "Author": "rmclee", "ReviewID": "UR128264614", "Content": "spent 1 1/2 nights. despite we returned at 16h room was not made which shld not happen for such a category of hotel. checkout 15 min which is far too long (he had to check various time about use of minibar). staff very kind. check in at oriental club fast and detailed information was given. overall good standard with weaknesses as mentioned above. however view exceptional, if y book harbour view.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBreathtaking views and FANTASTIC location !!!!!\u201d", "Author": "TRACEY E", "ReviewID": "UR128213361", "Content": "Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore.

Good hotel setup with nice bars and restaurants, including a Morton's. The hotel has the rooms on the outside of a large lobby opening which goes straight up. We were on the executive floor but did not go to the lounge. The room was very nice but ours did not have a city view. Which for us is ok. It was well layed out and had the nice touches in the bathroom and throughout. The most spectacular amenity was the pool, which is on the rooftop and quite large. You can easily do laps. The view of the city from the pool area is fantastic and the day beds and the pool furniture looked quite comfy. The workout area is a nice room but does not have a great variety for weight training. It does have many running and eliptical machines so I can't see there every being a wait for one of those. Now the location...... it is about 4 blocks from the City Hall subway which can be reached either outdoors or indoors. Actually, with the humidity in Singapore, going indoors is very popular. You can also walk to One Fullerton (Marina Bay) and then further to Boat and Clark Quay's. If you are a runner, you can easily hook up with the river trails from here.

Empty plates are cleared fast. Room: Very spacious with a huge L-shaped sofa that can probably sit 6 people, comes with a 32 inch LCD TV, iPod docker and DVD player. If you bring a laptop, you can plug it to the TV with the cables that is provided in-room. Welcome fruits are provided. Bedroom also comes with LCD TV, iPod docker and DVD player. The bed is very comfortable. The corridor to the toilet is also quite spacious which has a big cupboard, some drawers and luggage storage area, which can store about 2 big luggages and a few small ones. Toilet comes with a separate shower area and a bathtub, provided with bath salt and toiletries. Later then we know that the suite is 73 square metres in size. View: Not much of a view for the room we stay as it is facing Suntec City. Breakfast: Very delicious breakfast buffet. The breakfast closes at 10:30am. We went for the breakfast at 10am and the staff are still preparing new food to replenish those that has finished. At 10:30am, the staff went to each table to inform us that they are closing soon but we can grab our food first and continue eating while they keep the food. The waffle is one of my favourite as it's crispy! Gym: Upon entering, we are given a bottle of water and a towel each. The staff is attentive enough to know that I have changed to another machine after one workout and came to ask whether I need her assistance. In a typical gym, there will be shared TV and the volume not very audible. In Oriental, the TV is on the machine itself which is on the same screen as the workout setting. You can toggle the screen to view between the TV and the workout status, or show both at the same time. Earphone is provided for use to watch TV but request it from the staff at the gym and return it after use. The TV programmes come in many languages with channels like HBO, Star Movies, etc. If that is not enough, you can plug your iPhone or iPod to the machine. Swimming Pool: We didn't use the pool and it is very crowded during the day. What makes this pool special is the sunbath chairs in the pool which means, the chair is half dipped in the pool and you can sit on the chair to sunbath and also partially submerge in water. Beside the pool are sheltered daybeds that can fit 2 person each.

We were looking for a hotel that was centrally located and had a great pool area. We had booked a standard room and a Mandarin Grand room (for the couple with a child). Upon arrival the couple with the child were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was done in order to keep both rooms near each other (a nice touch). The one bedroom suite was amazing and had its own private balcony and gorgeous views of Marina Bay. The standard room was nice, but considering the price, not amazing. The whole hotel appears to be built around a central atrium area which resembles the inside of a honeycomb and seems somewhat dated. It does not maintain the sleek Asian luxury hotel feel of the lobby/reception area or more modern feel of the pool area. However, overall the hotel is of a five star standard and is well worth a visit. The best things about the hotel are the breakfast buffet which is definately something to behold and the pool area. Positives: 1. Breakfast has so many choices it would be impossible to want for anything. The quality was very good. 2. Pool is great any time of the day and has beautiful views of the City. Spending a day on a cabana is a real treat and poolside food and service are great. We also enjoyed dinner at Bay@5 one evening. 3. The gym is great. Very modern. 4. Spa treatments, although pricey, are very nice. Not so great 1. For the price, there are other hotels in Singapore which are just as good (if not better) and better value. 2.

I love everything about this hotel - the location, the food, the service and that fabulous pool. I do think that you need to be using all this hotel's facilities to get the best from it. If I simply wanted a room, I might not pick this hotel - the rooms are good but probably no better than other hotels in the same class. It is the whole package that impresses, when one has the chance to see excellence in service standards. I do love the marina view and always pick a room facing in that direction. An added attraction now is the light show every night from the Marina Bay Sands that is visible from marina facing rooms. The breakfasts in the MO are fabulous. Certainly the largest selection of food that I have ever encountered in a breakfast buffet and all of wonderful quality. I'd also love to know how they pull off the memory trick of remembering everyone's names. On day one its easy - you give a room number, so of course they know. But on day 2 and subsequent days they are almost uncanny when they greet you by name before you have spoken, take you to a table that already has your preferred newspaper lying on it because they saw you select it from the rack the first day, and bring you without needing to be told the tea for me and coffee for my husband. It is that sort of attention to detail that marks this hotel out - and the service is delivered with a smile and warmth. I also love the pool - so much so that I currently have a picture of it as wallpaper on my computer! The pool is surrounded by comfortable loungers and cabanas, and lots of greenery - a perfect oasis where I have spent many relaxed and happy hours. There is a good food and beverage service there and also staff frequently offer water, cool cloths and complimentary snacks.

The check-in was ok (they checked me in at the lobby reception not sure why I was not escorted to check in at the Club Floor which they should) and the staffs on a general note are very courteous, helpful and professional. I booked the Club Room marina view but upon entering the room realised that it was ocean facing. They claimed that for Club Floor there is no distinction between marina or ocean facing like the cheaper room types so be sure to specify what you want during booking if marina facing is what you desire. For me specifically I was staying the night on Chinese New Year eve so it was important for me to have marina view to watch the fire works. Anyway there was no problem at all I was shiftly moved to the room I wanted so I gave them the credit for that. Honestly I was very much looking forward to thier Club Lounge as the highlight of my stay but there was just something left to be desired. The Lounge has nice cosy atmosphere, but gave you the feeling that somehow it needs a face lift to be on par with many of the 5* hotels around. Moreover the lounge actually faces the boring city rather the marina. The afternoon tea was quite sterile too as I expected more hot food and desert choices. The evening cocktails was alright, with nice white wine (Cloudy Bay) and champagne. The good thing about booking the Club Room is you also get guranteed 6 pm late check-out. The room is beautifully appointed but nothing spectacular for the price I paid, a bit on the smaller side but well maintained. You can tell that the toilet is of a 90's design, with a minuscule bathtub (it is easily the smallest I have seen for the past 10 years of my hotel stay) and a shower cubicle so tiny you can hardly maneuver your hands to wash your back. The only marvelous thing about this hotel is the swimming pool - absolutely gorgeous! It is a must try even if you just wanna lay down on the sun bed.

Particularly dinner (though it'll cost you S$68-S$78). Breakfast is also good though service needs more staff. Location at Marina Square is great. You can jump right onto the MRT through the mall. You can walk around the area to Esplanade, Shoppes at Marina Sands, Raffles City, Chijmes. Gym is good. Pool area is beautiful with great service. In general, service here is fantastic: check-in, check-out, room service, restaurant service, bell hops. Rooms are quiet, beds are comfortable, everything works, water pressure and temperature great. People have mentioned that the rooms seem dated. They must be used to the new explosion of China 5 star hotels. If you are used to traveling in the States or Europe - you'll ask \"wait, what's wrong with this room?\". Only issue I have is the price of food - though they do make up for it partially with excellent presentation and quality. Room service of a garden salad (no protein) with a plate of fruit was something like S$60. Seems a bit excessive. Would highly recommend. I would also recommend the Pan Pacific which is in the same area. Mandarin Oriental has a more intimate feel, better buffet. Pan Pacific is more modern/open feel with a great Indian restaurant (though equally pricey).

You name it and they have it in their b'fast menu. But apart from that, MO is just as good as any other 5* hotel anywhere else in this world. The service is decent (had to remind them a couple of time for certain issues to get them resolved). The staff is friendly with a smile always on their face but that is what they're supposed to do. I've stayed in other 5* hotels and I found the service and amenities far better than what MO has to offer. The rooms are small and dated. Bed was comfortable. Items in the Mini bar are ridiculously over priced ($9 for a coke can !! ) and so are other food items and services. The problem is not money, it's the wastage of money. Just because a property is 5* doesn't mean it has to inflate cost of every single thing. Better get your coke cans and mineral water from the Marina Square mall which is linked to the hotel.

PROS: 1. Location is really convenient to a cheap mall for some quick purchases 2. The management staff are very well trained. Very proactive, jump in to help guests. However, th front line staff are horrible 3. Housekeeping is terrific. They do a miracle to make this old hotel look like very clean and fresh. 4. Room service was great. We ordered indina food. The desserts are to die for. Must try - pecan brownie with their home made vanilla ice cream 5. I see many comments about the breakfast at Melt. But i didnt think it was special. Lots of variety, but everytime i took out a plate to get some food, the plate would be dirty! but variety is definitely very good. 6. The bed was beautiful. I have not slept so comfortably in years! 7. The view from the harbour rooms is very nice. You see the amazing sands resort to the left and the entire singapore skyline on the right. 6. And thats about it! CONS: 1. Check in: the lady was very pleasent, but she got everythign wrong. Firstly i wanted to pay by debit card for the incidentals. She said they would just note down my details and not charge. Later in the day i get a call from the reception that they wil have to charge me the entire room rate + $200 immediately. It is strange that i am expected to pay the entire room rate a day before i checkout!! I have stayed at several hotels around the world and paid with debit cards. The hotel will generally take the incidentals and on checkout, they will return in cash. The room rate is never charged at check in. Worst thing was when i asked to speak to a manager (because the person who called me was hopelessly lost) terrance called me and pretty much regurgitated the \"hotel policy\". What happened to the famous mandarin oriental service! 2. The front desk lady very politely asked me if i wanted the newspaper. I asked for the business times and as i write this review from the hotel room at 9 am, no newspaper yet 3. The room is tiny! I would say about 25 square meters. For $550 that is a shame. 4. The room itself is aging. The hotel interiors are nice till the 4th floor, where all the restaurants are. Very tired on the floors with the rooms. 5. Pool staff speak no english. The waiter had me open the menu and point to the pina colada so that he could write it down in his pad. The manager at the pool is terrific. Pity his staff let him down. 6. The bathroom in the room has no door to the WC area. And there is no sound proofing, which can be embarrassing even if you are staying with your wife. 7. There was a large group of tourists at the lobby last evening, and they just sat all around the lobby. I had to fight my way through to get to the lifts. The hotel staff just stood there watching, instead of guiding the guests away to some private area. 8. I am sure that this is a safety code violation, that the hair dryer in the room is within easy distance of the bath tub. I am an architect and i was very surprised that a hotel of his calibre would overlook someing like this. All in all, i think the mandarin oriental is still going strong only because of their management. They clearly do not have front line staff of the same calibre.

The hotel, which would be a perfectly nice business hotel at perhaps two thirds the price, is not the luxury destination that the brand promises. As it is, the Mandarin is overpriced in every respect, and tends to nickel-and-dime its guests as well. The rooms: While pleasant and with good views, rooms are small and pretty standard. Even worse was the housekeeping; every time I entered the room, there was a faint unpleasant odor that was kind of smoky and musty, even though I was on a non-smoking floor. There was also accumulated dust in some spots, such as in the (purely decorative?) wicker easy chair that looked unused for months. The TV never worked properly, with the remote being very finicky and only changing channels if pointed at the minibar cabinet below. Loud guests can be heard passing by in the halls. Toiletries are so-so. Turndown service is unimpressive: no cookies or chocolates, just a breakfast menu left on the bed. Room service is expensive, around S$30 and up for mains. The menu also skews to standard international hotel fare. WiFi, which these days should be complimentary, costs extra. The hotel: The gym is nice enough, but smallish and lacking in some equipment. The pool area is excellent, with all-day sun exposure and lots of chaises. However, the clientele includes many families and children which makes the atmosphere less relaxing, as well as making it more difficult to do laps in the pool. The restaurants are good but, again, expensive and not especially exciting. The worst aspect of the place though is the lackluster service. Almost everything required calling twice, from attempting to get the non-functional TV working, to waiting around for an early check-in, to calling for help with an early-morning emergency. Employees are friendly and smile a lot, but tend to be focused on doing things by the book and aren't terribly efficient. This is the general state of service in Singapore, but that doesn't make it any less disappointing. A notable exception to this was the staff at the business center who offered tea and actually had a personality. In Singapore, the Four Seasons or St. Regis are calmer and more luxurious. For a business hotel, the Conrad offers much better value for the money and has excellent amenities as well. As far as Mandarin hotels go, the Hong Kong and New York locations are much better hotels; having been to those, I was very disappointed with my experience in Singapore. I would advise their management to review every aspect of the guest experience as well as raising the standard of service.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg City, Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cI am a fan of MO...........\u201d", "Author": "Nordic_Mike", "ReviewID": "UR124105432", "Content": "And MO Singapore does not disappoint. This hotel for me somehow makes me feel much at home in Singapore. When we arrived, we were offered a room on club level at an extra minimal charge including harbor view which we immediate went for. Cannot recommend this upgrade strong enough, as not only do you have a great view over the Marina Bay towards the new Sands hotel, but also small features such as complementary club level access, where by the way you may both check in and also check out upon departure, a great little feature to avoid queuing up downstairs in the lobby, free wifi, delicious breakfast, afternoon tea, evening snack and drinks. But I must say that the Melt cafe on 4th floor probably serves the most lavishly breakfast I have ever tried in my life - an amazing suggestion of food from many continents, especially the fruit and juice station is marvelous. And you can enjoy your food both indoors or outdoors in the garden. The club level rooms are spacious and luxurious, full of amenities, although I do find the bathrooms somewhat ready for a renovation! The staff is overly friendly and courteous. One evening at our visit in the lounge, our waiter Sam assisted us in arranging a special trip to a little hidden gem in Singapore, the outdoor 62 level bar 1-Altitude on top of the former UOB bank. An amazing experience, as you have great views of Singapore and are actually looking down on the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Remember to have a table reserved in advance and you beat the queues on the way up the elevator to the top. Highly recommended. The swimming pool area at the Mandarin Oriental hotel was recently renovated and is a true oasis in this town where you can also enjoy the sun on beds that are smartly fixed right beneath the poolwater surface.

I was disapointed in this hotel and do not think it deserves to be a MO. The issues I had were; 1 The airport pickup was in a van that would be considered by a holiday Inn. Not a patch on the cars used by other MO properties. (The Peninsular in HK pick up in a new Rolls) 2 The property was booked for a suite and a 2 bedroom room. Got the suite but the 2 bed was a King and a rollaway. 3 The property is tired. The suites arent up to other properties yet they still charge a premium price. 4 The Concierge was hopeless. He sent us to a shopping centre that wasnt open for another 2 hours and a bookshop that had closed down even though we found a bookshop in the arcade directly behind the hotel. 5 Service in the inhouse Japanese Restaurant was poor. The positives are. 1 The Hotel faces the new Marina Bay Casino building. 2 Breakfast was good.

The staff were genuinely very thoughtful, mindful, friendly and did their jobs exceptionally well. Mandarin Oriental should be proud. From the moment we asked to have an upgrade, the front desk sure delivered with a Harbour view room on the 18th floor -perfect for the firework display that was happening the following night for the Chinese New yrs eve celebrations. Sure you pay the rates and some might say that it is how it should be but I've experienced a lot of hits and misses in a variety of accommodations around the world and I think the service that we received was exceptional and consistent ..reality is not quite the same once you leave the Mandarin Oriental. I asked the concierge if I could get my sandals mended - it required hand stitching - it was over the public holidays but they found a cobbler nevertheless and walked over to the shop to make sure the cobbler did exactly what was required with the un damaged sandal for reference. Breakfast at the MElt cafe was again a delight - staff remembered your name not your room number! they greeted you with warmth but left you alone to graze on an amazing buffet spread. The pool staff are also very attentive - all in all you walk out feeling like you have had a proper break no matter how short your stay is because of the high level of service delivered by such lovely friendly staff you feel completely de-stressed and rejuvinated .

However, service is the most important fundamental. My family and I found the service here to be consistently poor throughout the week we stayed. Our experience with poor service began at the airport. I arrived with my family, tired after a long international flight, and we had booked a hotel minivan to meet us at the airport. Our confirmation email listed the correct date/time of the flight. There was no one to meet us, and we eventually learned that that they hadn\u2019t sent anyone despite the reservation. When I called the hotel to ask where our car was, I was put on hold for a few minutes while someone investigated. Finally she came back on the line and asked if she could call me back in 5 minutes. I was roaming internationally on my iPhone and didnt want more phone calls, plus we were tired and just wanted to get to the hotel, so I suggested that we instead just get a taxi. She said that we shouldn\u2019t do this, because the ride had already been arranged. So, I agreed to the 5-minute callback. Not having received any call back 13 minutes later, I telephoned again and asked where our ride was. The same woman asked me if we had met our pickup yet, revealing that she had still not figured out that no one had been sent to pick us up. It took a while to get a cab since we needed a large one to accomodate all of us, luggage, baby stroller, etc. When we arrived at the hotel, a manager came out to apologize and he said they had gotten the flight time wrong and thought we were coming in the evening (even though my email confirmation stated the correct time). This was only the beginning of what turned out to be a week of consistently poor service. When you pick up the phone and press the \"guest services\" button, it takes on average about 10 rings for someone to pick up. Often, no one picks up even after 20 or so rings and it fails over to the hotel operator. The hotel operators then serve as backup for the guest services staff. Here are a few examples. -Called for concierge, told s/he was on another line, they asked me what my question was, and said they\u2019d pass it on to the concierge for a callback. No callback came and when I called the concierge later, they hadnt heard of my question -Have to call and remind them of requests often. Average number of calls to get anything done is 2. Sometimes takes 3, or going down to the front desk personally to press for what you need. -Ordered some $18 \u201chomemade\u201d nachos with salsa. What they delivered was not home-made, but rather about one third of a bag of a store-bought brand, served at room temperature. Also instead of salsa, they sent up a couple of tomato slices instead. It was not as advertised. -I asked for a bathroom scale (took 3 requests), they brought up a small analog scale that was very inaccurate. I called to asked for a better one, the call failed over to operator after about 20 rings. The operator called me back and said she had been told that this was the only model available. If you want to check your weight at this hotel, bring your own scale or buy one locally. The quality of the scale was significantly below par for a top hotel. -Called to ask for minibar to be restocked around 10 am. They said they\u2019d send someone. I stayed home that day. No one came until about 5 pm. -Desk chair broke for no reason while I was sitting on it. A wheel came off. Got a replacement, but the wheels kept popping off the replacement. Not breaking, but off the shaft so I had to put them back on again. The quality of the room chair also was below par for a top hotel. -A final disappointing experience was when I realized I had left my iPad to television cable, which costs $40, in the room, still hooked up to the television. I realized this after I got back home. It is hard to imagine that they did not promptly notice this when preparing the room for the next guest, as the television will not function properly without removing it, as I displaced the normal cables to make room for my iPad adapter cables, and the cable is very large, and was plugged into an obvious wall outlet. The time/cost involved in having it shipped back to me internationally wouldn't have been worth it, so I just bought a new one, but I was curious to see whether or not they would notify me of the forgotten item. They never did, I did not receive any email, phone call, or any other attempt at notifying me about this item. Overall a very disappointing experience. Changing hotels with an entire family would have been too much hassle, and the hotel was pretty good as long as you didn\u2019t need any services from them, so we just stayed. One comment about the room itself \u2013 the bath tub was quite small. I doubt anyone over 5\u20194\u201d or so would feel comfortable in it. Also below par for a 5-star hotel.

It is not new but, having been well maintained, ages gracefully. It is a solid option in a city well endowed with efficient 5-star business hotels.

On the plus side, a well-rounded offer of restaurants (international cafe, steak house, Chinese, Japanese, bar, all of excellent quality) and a nice swimming pool. The rooms are average in size, decent but outclassed by competitors such as the Conrad, Fairmont or Ritz-Carlton. Equipment is standard for the category: flat-screen TV, fast Wifi internet, good storage space, but no espresso machine. Internal decoration is bright and airy, not overly luxurious. The rooms facing the Marina Bay enjoy very attractive views. Where the Mandarin beats competition is in the quality of its service, which I consider to be the best in Singapore. My experience was flawless, from check-in (fast and personalized, in the room itself) to room service (smooth and attentive) through restaurant service (personnel is friendly and calls guest by name). Location is central but there is no street life, despite a recently improved environment thanks to the Esplanade nearby.

Hence each good experience seemed super perfect just like when every so-so experience in a place where youre badly looked after sometimes starts to feel less than average. This was a leisure stay but Spa facilities were not used as requested appointments were available only after 11am most days. The situation of the hotel is good. Its a 5 minute walk from the Marina Bay shopping centre. Ask concierege to show you the short cut through the parking garage if you need to pop to the seven eleven for a local sim card for example otherwise it takes 15 minutes to get to the other side of MB shopping mall. The MB mall has the equivalent of our high street shopping brands and coffee shops like Starbucks etc; latter are open til about 10pm. For luxury brands take a 10 minute taxi to Ion Orchard- one of the biggest malls. I had no problem with getting taxis from MO unlike when I visited the Fullerton Hotel where I had to wait 1 hour (although in fairness this may have been due to the MRT being broken down that evening). Its good to select a hotel where taxis are easily available since they are a convenient (v.few traffic jams) way of getting around and travelling between most shopping centres is an average of 10 SD. My favourite experience at MO was breakfast. It is by far the best buffet breakfast I have experienced in any hotel I have stayed. Please excuse the fact that much of this review is therefore focused around it. It is worth paying the 40SD for although it was included in the Club package (note that they currently offer the Club package for the weekends if you book through TA). If you take a Club Room you will have the choice of eating in the Oriental Club Lounge (OCL) or at Melt restaurant. The difference is in both the setting and the presentation of food choice. In OCL you are on the 19th floor. If you take a look at the website photos the interior looks stunning. It is very nice and the triple ceiling height space gives a very airy feel. But it is situated on the front side of the hotel which doesn't give the best views of Singapore and to that end you will enjoy your food looking over tennis courts, some traffic and the back of the Pan Pacific hotel. Still, if you want views of Marina Bay Harbour itself then you will not be short of opportunities to experience it. Request a harbour view category room as it is indeed a lovely view to wake up to and see lit up at night. Back to OCL- its about 500 square meters and very long (just as in the photos) so although it gives each guest a feeling of seclusion you may find it awkward walking up and down to the open kitchen/ snack area if you want to sit at one of the window sofas for your meal as opposed to the dining areas. The thing I did not enjoy so much about the OCL was their ambitious policy of no open or casual footwear therefore excluding all manner of flip flops and trainer type shoes. Its a warm climate so it doesn't help leisure travellers much and this was one of the reasons I had breakfast at Melt and also hardly used the OCL. Also there was no outside terrace which I found unusual for such a kitted out space. Melt is more laid back- with various sections to its dining area including an outside area which is nice and super clean and free of any insects/ mossies but surrounding by lush plants. More details on the breakfast- there were countless stations in these sections- Indian (better than I had in Mumbai!), Chinese, Eggs any style, smoothies (go for the blueberry), a well equipped waffle counter, full pastry selection including gluten free and restricted diet options, Full English Breakfast, fresh fish, meats, salads, fruits, everything you can think of. The thing most worth noting is that the variety was good but the quality of the produce was outstanding. Not before or since have I sampled so many foods all at their optimum ripeness at one sitting. Truly amazing. Thank you MO for putting so much dedication into sourcing only the best for your guests. Details of the room itself. I had the Club Harbour. It was a good size and nice layout with 'see through' bathroom and privacy blind. The amenities are Elemis which in my view are not as nice as Molton Brown or especially L'Occitaine. I think a hotel like MO should upgrade these especially for certain category of room. Basic things like mouthwash and shower cap were not there although the latter was provided on request. I had requested a quiet room. Often at 6am there were disturbances from a noisy trolley being wheeled out of the service area opposite but one to my room. It didn't matter as I was usually awake before then but maybe worth noting to ask to be given a room away. The room facilities included DVD/ Ipod/ etc. but the system was so outdated and slow to operate that I eventually gave up trying to use it. That aspect really needs addressing for this standard of hotel/ room category. Overall I did not think it was worth paying extra for the Club room category but that may in part be due to the fact that I didn't use the facilities of the OCL much. The pool area is very nice and spacious although I did not use it in the day so can not comment on how busy or not it may have got. I found the gym (about 1000 sq ft) busy when I used it (when it opened at 5.30am). It was good to have those early opening hours and even better if it could have been 24 hours for guests on very different time zones (like the gym at Fullerton Bay hotel). In terms of equipment I found it limited considering the size of the hotel for eg. there were only two cross trainers and two bikes- one of which sounded close to the end of its life. There were 6 or so treadmills and some resistance machines but not a great selection- at least not for women. The housekeeping was totally unfaultable. Thank you MO Housekeeping for being so thorough! I had a complimentary pressing service included- this was done with efficiency and perfection. Every house call does take that little bit longer to answer due to the size of the hotel Everyone complains at hotel prices in Singapore which are definitely at the extortionate end but I dont see how any part of the world should operate outside the basic principles of supply and demand. My only doubt about staying here in the future would be that for a leisure stay it is quite a boring environment as it is more suited to business travellers.

We regretted that we were not staying for several nights. Now, I travel a lot and I do not normally get round to writing reviews, and it has taken me a while to get round to writing this one, but our experience was so overwhelmingly good that I feel that I must share it. When we arrived it was a little late, and it seemed that there had been a mix-up with the room allocation. So, this hotel is not perfect and it took a little while to get our luggage to the room. However, after that shaky start, it was possibly the best experience in over 25 years of travelling. We had booked a Premier Harbour Room but were upgraded to a suite. Marvellous panoramic views of Marina bay. It was just after my birthday and this had been mentioned at reservation. In the room was a little birthday cake and also a hand written birthday card. Easy enough to put a cake in the room; the hand-written card shows that they really thought about it. The hotel ambiance is warm and wraps itself around you as you walk in from the sweltering humidity of Singapore. At breakfast time the breakfast buffet was one of the most extensive I have ever experienced but even so, whatever you asked for, they would try to provide it. I saw another customer with some fresh berries. I said \"Where did you get those?\", to which he replied \"I asked for them\". So I asked and was duly provided with fresh berries. Shortly, during my breakfast, a member of staff asked if I would be there the next day, as, if I was, they would prepare my berries ready for me. How I wished that we could stay for another night! We thought that maybe 12:00 check out would be a little early as we had a night flight. We heard that we could take a shower after we had checked out, should we wish. I expected that maybe we could use the health club or something like that. No, they made a room available for us. After we had checked out. At no extra charge.

Apart from the lady who checked us in, who was lovely and attentive, the staff were quite dismissive, for example behaving snootily when we asked to pay off our bill half way through our stay, and not letting us use spa changing rooms when we used the pool (the pool changing rooms were essentially a cupboard with a toilet- not good when the hotel ask you not to wander around in a dressing gown etc. Where are you supposed to change?). When at the pool the hotel began setting up for a corporate event, again adding to the feeling of discomfort; having an early evening swim surrounded by suits and loud,awful lounge music clearly intended to entertain said suits was not the best end to a day.

Public buses to/from Changing airport are right across the street. Also, the hop on/hop off buses stop here. Negatives: the building is outdated both on the outside an in. The ceilings are low, the chandeliers are totally not \"zen\" and the whole decore and feel of the place is non-Mandarin Oriental. They also do not offer free wi-fi in room or anywhere else in the hotel including the business center. T he charge is 50 Singapore Cents per minute or about 40 US Cents. This is so unusual especially for Eastern Asia as most hotels -even 3-stars- offer complimentary wi-fi. We had reserved through Am Ex Platinum. The could not upgrade us which very rarely happens but is understandable. But the complimentary amenity -which is the least desirable one- a free gift was not delivered to us on the first day and we had to remind the front desk about it. Even at that they delivered half of it and we had to make another call to the front desk to complete the transaction. We did not get a chance to use the Spa services. A 60-90 minutes message starts at about US$200-280. The outdoor lap pool is pretty and about an average size. There are also a few poolside private cabanas. So, choose this hotel for its location and view not for the brand name.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cNeed more than flip-flops\u201d", "Author": "Marcusom", "ReviewID": "UR122098447", "Content": "I have been to Singapore a few times now and this hotel is definitely up there with places to stay.

The regular rooms have a 2pm check-in which wasn't great for us as we arrived at 6 in the morning - exhausted. To have an early check-in for the regular room you need to pay for an extra night which can be pretty pricey. Instead, we upgraded our room to one of the Club class rooms. This was cheaper than an extra night in the other room and also meant we had access to the club lounge which meant free breakfast each morning and a couple of hours of free cocktails each evening so it paid for itself.

There are plenty of choices in the area, and the MO has been around for a while. Although the hotel is in the Marina Square complex, there are no internal doors through to the malls, so you have to walk through the outside and up the staircase to get there. There\u2019s a shortcut to the 7/11 area through the carpark on the right side fo the hotel however. The room was a little on the small side, not cramped but definitely compact. Quality furnishings and a very comfy bed, big tv with a myriad of channels (and bose speakers in the ceiling), ipod dock, dvd player and all the usual comforts you would expect in a five star hotel are there. At this price point however, surely they can ditch the generic toiletries and provide wifi for free. The outdoor pool looked amazing, and there are cabana beds along with the usual deckchairs, some of which are in the water. Breakfast was excellent, with plenty of choices - hot/cold/western/asian, with noodle and juice bars thrown in. Service was good, everyone was friendly and in particular the waitresses at breakfast were extremely efficient despite the place being filled to capacity. The hotel was literally bursting with business and convention travelers, along with a few large tour groups thrown in. As a result the lobby and common areas became a zoo at times, and it\u2019s also a popular wedding venue. Being part of the MO group you expect good service and amenities, and while it was a pleasant stay, it didn\u2019t exactly live up to the hype of being the best in Singapore. There wasn\u2019t anything great about it. Rooms at the Ritz are about 30% bigger and it arguably matches the MO across all spectrums. Conrad (which has rooms 30% bigger) is often significantly cheaper and provides much of the same. If you get a corp rate its not a bad choice, but at SGD$500 a night there are better alternatives in the area.

Then, on two successive nights, the reception desk did not pick up the calls untill 15 or 20 rings (on one instance, the phone was even put down). I understood it was because in the night the phone is transferred somewhere else, but surely the hotel can expect calls around 11 pm from guests coming back after dinner. On the second night, I then spoke to the duty manager, who promised to give me a specific message by 7 am the next day. Same did not arrive till 7.30 am when I found the duty manager still at the reception, he pleaded complete ignorance. I subsequently had a discussion with the rooms division manager and also an email response from the General manager to the standard feedback form which I filled - at least this was a solace.

I arrived when the hotel had practically 100% occupancy and preparing for two or three weddings that evening. The lobby was buzzing with guests and although some people don\u2019t like it, I find the lobby area calming and welcoming. Within a couple of minutes I was escorted to my 21st floor room with fantastic views over Marina Bay. The room is large for Singapore standards and having booked a Club Room, it gave me full access to the Club Lounge, free Wi-Fi, breakfast etc. The d\u00e9cor in the room was excellent with all the things you might need whether on a business trip or pleasure. A number of very good restaurants are available at various levels and don\u2019t forget to visit the Axis Bar on the 4th floor if you need a drink with friends and you like some soothing jazz. The Club Lounge on the 19th floor has amazingly friendly and helpful staff whether you are going for breakfast, afternoon tea or cocktails before you venture out for the evening. The hotel is very well located both for business and for pleasure with shopping malls within minutes stroll away and in any case taxis are always available and cheap.

Mandarin Oriental is absolutely an amazing place to stay if your are ready to splurge. Each & every penny that you spend on your stay at this hotel is worth it!!. Your amazing experience begins with the check in itself. We were personally escorted by one of the staff at the reception right up to our room & we were explained each & every facility that we can enjoy during our stay even before we reached our room. They asked us whether it is our first time in Singapore & gave us a room which had a breath taking view of Marina Bay Area on the 11th Floor!! Just check out the photograph to believe what I am saying!! Afterwards we were amazed more and more as time passed by. The property is located bang opposite the famous Singapore Merlion statue & the famous Esplanade bay area. You walk for 5 minutes & you can catch the ever so convenient MRT to reach anywhere in Singapore! Just adjacent to it is a huge mall which is accessible from the hotel entrance also. They have an exotic poolside restaurant which serves an array of delicacies from all over the world (of course that comes with a price). The best thing that you would enjoy is their GRAND (I really mean it) BUFFET BREAKFAST! I have never seen such a massive spread of different delicacies in any Buffet any where that I have stayed so far. Anyone who stays here would definitely not want to miss it (if it is inclusive in your room tariff). You are escorted by one of the hotel staff while you enter the restaurant for the breakfast & are explained what all they serve & where are the corresponding Buffets located.

The club lounge is superb with good food and complimentary alcoholic beverages between 1730-1930.

Food throughout the hotel is of extremely high quality and the buffet in \"The Melt\" restaurant had more choice than I've seen in a buffet before. The pool area is excellent and the complimentary and frequently supplied cold towels, water and jelly is a great touch. Complimentary WIFI throughout the hotel and pool area is a nice bonus and puts to shame the UK hotels that charge \u00a315 for 24 hours.. One evening, the concierge (Leon) spent 30 minutes sitting with us discussing the things to see and do to in Singapore. To spend that much time with one guest shows a true commitment to customer service by this hotel (and Leon) The only downside to this hotel is the very high cost of food and drink.

Thumbs Up 2) Escoting to the room: Very nice service and detailed description on the controls 3) Toiletries: I enjoyed the ginger and lemon grass fragance, truly relaxing 4) Room Service: Ice - Perfect and wonderful service. Very polite and prompt to our request. Pleasant smile too. Kudos! 5) Swimming Pool - The service was fantastic, we are escorted a a wonderful shaped cabana. And was treated with cold towels and cold water. The adult swimming pool was a very fun for my son with his float. 6) Room Service: Ice - Perfect and wonderful service. Very polite and prompt to our request. Pleasant smile too. Kudos! Failure to meet the expectation. Let me share as below: 1) Upon Arrival: 1st impression is very important. The doorman in red costume did not bother to open our door or react to my son greetings. Seeing his warm expression in opening a earlier door with foreigners really differs greatly. Another personel asked in mandarin, you have luggage and tried to shove us forward. Maybe they have thought that we are wedding guests but it should not differs in the treatment. 2) Arrival in Front Hall: Seeing another reviewer saying about young kids feeling welcome, i was hoping that my son will feel welcome. But while he was looking at the pool area, lots of eyes were on him with wary eyes. 3) Rooms Size: Room was rather small for a 5 Star hotel compared to Ritz. Toilet size was average too. 4) Room service - Water and toiletries: I have asked for additional water and ice in one phone request. When the water reached, i saw no ice. The reply i got is \"I am only in charge of water not ice. Please wait or call again\" Shockingly service. And the same irriate look when i get additional toiletries as well. Which we need as my son is staying with me. 5) Children Pool: However he did not enjoyed the children pool as it was quite boring with the shallow water and sprouts. Overall the experience was good, but i will not go there again. As the service really varies from each sector. And I realise that service tends to be better towards non-asian people. This is the same as MBS as well. Realy disappointing that locals are treated by such a way. Will not recommend to stay at Oriental Hotel. As it need to have more training for other staff except for the nice people at the servcie counter.

Having stayed at the St. Regis, the Regent (Four Seasons) and the Grand Hyatt in Singapore on prior visits, we decided to give the MO a try--primarily because of the views of Marina Bay that the other hotels lack. That was a mistake, especially at 528SD (on the weekend). While the views from the Bay View rooms are spectacular, the rest of the experience was not so great. The negatives: 1. The weekend package our travel agent booked offered (albeit not guaranteed) a 6PM checkout. She had even put a special request in our reservation that we would like a 3-4 PM checkout due to our departure time from Changi. When we arrived, the hotel indicated no knowledge of our request and offered no better than 1PM for checkout. After trying to be pleasantly persistent in getting something later than 1PM, the almost belligerant front desk clerk called over the front desk manager who, after some discussion, offered us 1:30PM. Bad way to start our stay. While it's understandable that every guest can't stay at the hotel until 6PM, to be offered basically nothing smelled a bit of \"bait and switch\". 2. MELT, the restaurant for breakfast is a chaotic \"zoo\". While it is well-staffed, there is no one even remotely assigned to tables, so getting coffee refills, juice or anything else is tedious. When we finished breakfast, it took 5 employess to decide (or figure out) if we had to sign a check since our breakfast was included in the rate. After 10 minutes, they just decided we could leave. So many SE Asian hotels are known for their spectacular weekend brunches and exellent service. The MO is not one of them. It seemed to be fully staffed but not functioning very smoothly. 3. While not the hotel's fault, the construction all around the entrance and Marina Bay Area make walking in the area rather difficult. How I missed the relative quiet and charm of the Botanic Gardens around the Regent and the St. Regis. While not a dreadful experience, the MO did not live up to my expectations for the brand. The hospitality was absent and, for the price, there are too many other better hotels in the City.

It has had one or two upgrades since then and is very consistent. It's in good shape decor wise and staff are excellent. Either Singapore or the US$ exchange rate has made it much more expensive than I recall. The rooms are spacious and of course always immaculate. Bottled water provided every day etc. Room service is prompt, good quality -- but I think pricey. S$28 plus for smoked salmon sandwich! I was attending a conference at SunTec - so this was very convenient; it wouldn't be if you wanted to shop along Orchard Road, though goodness knows what you'd want to buy as Singapore is SO expensive now. Dinner for 2 in a simple Sushi restaurant in the adjoining mall was S$82!! The MO's MELT cafe is excellent; and I had breakfast included. The Wasabi Bistro is very odd. OK food, but dreary decor - this needs sprucing up a bit. Get rid of the table cloths and make it look a bit more like a bistro for starters! It's also expensive - Bento box dinner $62 per person. I have stayed at the Club lounge several times but didn't this trip. It's not worth it. They wanted S$100 plus tax to upgrade - and it is not all day dining like some lounges (Ritz Carlton Moscow or Hilton Vienna - come to mind). Only breakfast and tea. Well -- breakfast I got included and MELT has a much larger selection of food - and who cares about a calorie laden afternoon tea. If it provided a good food service for lunch and dinner it might be worth it - otherwise I'd say skip it. Another thing to skip is a hotel airport pick-up. It's about S$85 vs $30 or so in a taxi. It's very easy to get a taxi, and I guess at some times of the day there may be a wait; but it is quite a short ride in; and Changi is such an easy airport to move thru - the security and comfort of knowing you have transportation awaiting you is not necessary. Overall - this is a solid and consistent hotel in Singapore. It's well maintained. However, had I NOT been attending a SunTec conference I would have probably stayed somewhere else (Sheraton - Hilton and got my points) - as many of the other 5* properties seemed to have better prices.

It all started at check-in. After flying for over 26 hours to get to Singapore, we arrived to hotel by taxi and were informed that room is ready. Yay! Mid-way through our check-in process, another staff member came by to talk to the young woman that was checking us in. Holding somebody else's passports in his hands and completely ignoring us, he started speaking loudly to the woman (not in English) so we couldn't understand what was going on. Since he was holding other guests passports in his hands, we assumed there was a problem with another guest. The woman smiled at us and replied to the rude guy in English that she is almost done checking us in and would help him in a minute. The guy continued to speak, getting super frustrated, constantly interrupting the woman and trying to get her attention. Finally, the woman got fed up with him, so she smiled at us, told us to wait a \"minute\", got up and left. \"A minute\" lasted for about 25 minutes during which not even a glass of water was offered. We were just sitting there waiting as if it was a small hotel with only 2 employees working. There were plenty of staff members around, but all of them were either walking around totally ignoring us or blankly staring at their computer screens. We were too tired and exhausted to complain, so we just waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, the woman came back, mood completely changed from politely nice to super agitated. She asked, once again, to complete registration forms, which we already completed before she abandoned us. We reminded her that forms were already completed. She got annoyed and barked back that she was \"getting our room ready for us.\" Like how? Did she go to vacuum the carpet in the room while we were waiting? We were way to tired to argue with her and all she really needed to do is apologize for making us wait for no apparent reason (and it would have been super nice to have the rude guy apologize to guests before barging in and interrupting in the middle.) However, there were no apologies from anyone. I already began to dislike this hotel before even getting to the room. Now, let me tell you that I was choosing which hotel to stay among Mandarin Oriental, Ritz-Carlton, and Marina Bay Sands. After less than exciting experience at Ritz Carlton in Osaka, I narrowed it down to Mandarin Oriental and Marina Bay Sands. The turning point to disregard Marina Bay Sands was after I read multiple reviews on tripadvisor that the check-in process took on average 45 minutes in Marina Bay Sands. Knowing that we would be coming to hotel straight from the airport after flying for 26 hours, last thing I wanted to do is to wait 45 minutes for no apparent reason during check-in process. So, I decided to go with Mandarin Oriental and ironically, the entire check-in process with them took actually longer than the dreaded 45 minutes in Marina Bay Sands. I was disappointed with my choice of hotel, especially at the steep price of over $600/night. We got to our room, which had a nice view of the harbor, was very comfortable, spacious and beautifully decorated (though you really need to close your eyes while walking from elevator to the room because hallways are pretty ugly.) I was too upset after rude check-in to appreciate the beauty of the room, bathroom and the outside view. From the window of our room I saw beautiful Marina Bay Sands and was wondering why I chose Mandarin Oriental. Some people might think that check-in process is not that important, but I tend to disagree. It provides guests with valuable first impression that could make the entire stay relatively positive or negative. Nobody likes to pay over $600/night and then be treated by annoyed staff members as if they are too bothered or busy to welcome you to their apparently luxury 5 star hotel. It is unprofessional and rude. Moving along... after taking a bath and getting back to cheerful mood, we decided to go explore Singapore (our first time visiting.) Concierge service proved to be excellent, attentive and very helpful. Everyone who we met at concierge desk was super friendly, polite and engaging. What a difference from our check-in experience! One night we decided to dine at the restaurant inside Mandarin Oriental and on our way to the room to change, stopped by the restaurant to see if we needed a reservation. It was about 4:50PM, restaurant was completely empty as it was too early for dinner. We walk from the elevator towards the restaurant, a young woman walks out from the restaurant and it goes like this (in the hallway): Her: Sir, we have a dress code, you must wear closed toe shoes to come to the restaurant. My husband: Good evening! Her: Yes, hello. I am sorry but we have a dress code. My husband: I know. We were just stopping by to see if you have room for 2 for dinner LATER tonight. Her: I am sorry, but we have a dress code. We did not eat there and never came back. Instead, we walked to the riverbanks where there are plenty of delicious restaurants and fun hosts who promise you honeymoon table, romantic table, the best table, or anything else that you might desire to ensure a pleasant dining experience. On the positive (very positive note): Mandarin Oriental breakfast buffet was truly something extraordinary that I haven't seen anywhere! It was so delicious and fresh that I would definitely recommend not to miss it! Our room rate did not include breakfast, so we had to pay over $100 for 2 people to have breakfast one morning, but it was worth every single penny. There are so many choices of tasty items that would satisfy even the pickiest person in the world. Different stations featuring various cuisine (yummy!), absolutely stunning presentation that makes you want to try everything you see, freshly squeezed exotic juices (and even wheat grass!). Having breakfast at Mandarin Oriental was truly a treat! We did not try the spa (though I wanted but changed my mind after check-in). In summary, I am still rating Mandarin Oriental high despite unpleasant experience at the check-in and dinner restaurant because it has great location close to many city attractions, yummy breakfast buffet, and because room was really comfortable, cozy and inviting. I will probably continue being loyal to Mandarin Oriental brand but most likely won't be staying at this location again.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston area, MA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "letsmakeadeal", "ReviewID": "UR117707067", "Content": "Really wonderful room.

One small niggle: the hotel is adjacent to the Marina Square Shopping Mall, but there did not appear to be a direct entry from the hotel to the mall - it was necessary to leave the hotel, walk about 100 metres and then go up a rather shabby staircase and a narrow passage to gain access to the mall.

Both the room and the bathroom were well-equipped with the usual amenities you would expect from a five-star hotel.

At time of booking, my bf requested an upgrade, which we were told would be subject to availability. On the day of our stay, he rang to check and was told that all rooms at the higher grade were fully booked - however we then tried to book the room on the hotel website and found it was available. I have no problem being told we cannot be upgraded, but I don't appreciate being misled by the staff. We ended up having to speak to a hotel manager who did upgrade us for a small fee and who greeted us personally when we checked in which was very nice. Note that the hotel spa area is currently undergoing refurbishment on the 4th floor - they don't tell you this until you check in, but if you have enough floors between you then the noise shouldn't be an issue. Room - we had a harbour view room, and the view from here is spectacular. The room here is not as big or luxe as some other MOs e.g. Jakarta, but still very nice. Unfortunately the flush on our toilet did not work properly so we had to stand by to make sure that the water stopped flowing. Clearly this is an issue housekeeping should be aware of. Pool - one of the best in the city and very very relaxing, like being at a resort. The only other I have enjoyed as much in a city was Sukhothai in Bangkok. For a late lunch I ordered the lobster club sandwich. And was given the chicken club. No issue so I asked for it to be changed to my order. 5min later the waiter came back with the original chicken club with a couple of pieces of lobster tucked in. Not good. Even worse, as I was eating the sandwich I realised that the chef had put in 2 slices of cheese and left the wax paper separator between the slices, leaving me to pick it out of the sandwich and from between my teeth.

By the way, there are a lot of photos ahead! So don't say that I didn't warn you in advance ya? :) Personally, from the friendly warm hotel staff to its impeccable service to well thought guest room, it is truly a pleasant and delightful stay in Mandarin Oriental Singapore. Everything was just amazing from the moment we stepped into the hotel till the last moment we waved goodbye to their staff and off to the airport. Knowing me who is very picky and particular on friendliness and service, this hotel has scored five stars on both fronts. ;) Their concierge, bell hops, front desk staff, house keeper and practically everyone working in the hotel is incredibly friendly and welcoming and willing to make our stay as the best one ever. Top notch service and I am very impressed by the entire team at this hotel. :) We always got someone to usher us to the room (so don't worry if you came back with handful of shopping bags) and upon arrival, luggages were brought promptly to the room too. Owh, in case you are taking public transportation, hotel concierge will arrange a cab for you at all time and will be very helpful to direct you the nearest MRT or bus station, so just let them know your needs. Great thing here as hotel is conveniently located very next to Marina Square and short walking distance to Esplanade Mall, Suntec City Mall, Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands. Perfect location and ideally situated yo! Hotel lobby was not that big tho and a little bit of dated and dark too, but worry not, the guest room (Premier Harbour) was awesome! Extra bonus with spectacular view of Marina Bay area and Singapore's financial district. Nicely sized room (even after we rolled in the babycot) with small office area and well equipped with plasma TV (over 30 channels available), DVD player and internet connection. Other room facilities and amenities are excellent as expected. Basically, we got everything that we requested at no fuss and no charge :) You know what? They have most fluffy pillows and heavenly bed that I ever slept on. I feel like sleeping on clouds like that. Owh owh owh! How wish that I have all the money in the world so that I can buy that type of bed and pillows and linens that I bet must be sold at freaking hefty price tag. -___- Their large marbled bathroom was superb with separate tub and shower and have large sink vanity. With good quality and comfy towels and bath robe, this is what I discern between good and great hotels. Not to mention that you can get this sexy view straight out of the bathroom through its glass window. >:} Hehehehe. Of course there are blinds on the glass panel lah. :P Owh ya, love their lemon grass and ginger fragrant toiletries too, very spa-ly smell. Room was cleaned every day with new towels and other room amenities too. Breakfast spread is excellent but I have nothing much to comment as we didn't really eat everything there. But the Belgian waffle is seriously out of this world and fresh fruit juices are made right in front you (just name the type of fruits you want it to be because basically everything is there). And the best part of all, the one which won the most stars is the pool area. Absolutely fantastic with comfy pool cabanas, ample sun loungers and breath taking view over the city as well. Seriously to die for and I don't mind going back again just to spend a quiet peaceful time in pool cabana. Good books, Ice Vanilla Latte, glasses, iPad and cushioned private cabana, ahhhh, what a pure bliss! But of course someone has to look after the kids lah kan. Pools are spacious and sufficiently big to accommodate all the guests. Kids pool is great too with with multiple of jet water to keep my kids amused and truly enjoyed conquering the pool to themselves. Towels are provided and iced water is continually brought to us and surely a great service from pool staff. Room rates? It might be a tad pricey but reasonable enough by its international standards and basically, we got what we paid for lah :P Hehehe..All in all, we had an awesome stay and went back home with memories that worth a lifetime.

The check in essentially occurred at breakfast which was very civilised altogether! We were shown to our harbour view room by 10 am, freshened up and nicely tucked in by 11am in the extremely comfortable king size bed. The room was nothing short of perfection - spacious, impeccably clean, all the toiletries and amenities required. One could essentially just bring a change of clothes! After a short period of exploring after our nap, we enjoyed a specially prepared, gluten free, 5 course meal at Cherry Garden cantonese restaurant at the hotel. Being coeliac, my partner does not get to enjoy chinese food that often. Weeks before arrival, Rebecca at Cherry Garden, designed a menu which was not only catered to the asian palate, but also completely gluten free. After the fourth course, the chef appeared from the kitchen to ascertain our verdict - two thumbs up and two very satisfied jet lagged diners. 830pm - enough time for a quick tipple before our 7am flight. A glass of port in the Axis Bar with live jazz music paved the way for what was ahead in our lovely bedroom - the fluffy and comfy bed! 6 hours later, we were woken up by a pleasant wake up call from reception. We were served a shot of espresso and a glass freshly squeezed OJ during our 5 am check out at the front desk.

The hotel has many good points. The door staff are all super friendly and make you feel very welcome on arrival. We opted for a club floor room and were on the 19th floor. The harbour view was fantastic. The room itself was very small but very nicely furnished. Clean and modern. The bed was extremely comfortable. The club lounge had a good selection of snacks and for the evening offered champagne which was a nice bonus. However it was sometimes hard to find a staff member to sit you down or tend to a request. We had been going to the lounge for two days wearing open toe shoes and then turned away on our third day for wearing such shoes. It was quite embarassing for us and we felt this should have been pointed out on the first day. We found the lounge had quite a sombre atmosphere compared to lounges at other hotels and we opted to eat breakfast in the Melt resturant and preferred it. More choice of food and it was lovely to have a table outside and it felt more holiday like. I appreciate that lounges are aimed at business travellers but they can still have a a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The breakfast at Melt was great- excellent food and service. The waiter even knew my name which was a nice touch. The restuarants here are excellent. We ate at Cherry Garden which was fantastic food and service and also at Dolce Vita which was excellent. One of the best pastas I've ever had! The pool area is outstanding. Fantastic views and a really modern, funky set up. Big, comfy 'pod-like' day beds and also cushioned sun loungers. We sat and had lunch outside at Dolce Vita overlooking the pool area and had a fantastic meal. I'd highly recommend. The spa here was good- we had a couples massage. Not the best masage I've ever had but that might be down to personal taste. The facilities at the spa were very nice although I'd recommend booking in advance as we struggled to get in and they only had one time slot available over the four nights we stayed.

CHECK-IN PROCESS: Very Good - We were able to check in early at our request. - Check-in process was relatively quick and completed inside the room. ROOM: Very Good - This is one of the rare hotels in Singapore where the room's temperature control actually worked! - Our room had a very nice view of the marina bay, MBS and Singapore Flyer. - Good TV/AV equipments with Bose speakers. The DVD player was a nice feature to keep our son entertained. (DVD's were available for loan from the business centre). - Internet was available as both wireless and normal. Internet was not complimentary but included in our room charges. - Nice room/bathroom layout and furniture. Be aware of the desk though. My son banged his head against the desk twice as the gap between the desk's corner and bed was quite small. We found out that the desk could actually be slided towards the window to provide more space. - Room was well equiped for business and the stationary (staplers, paperclips, highlighters, etc.) was a nice touch. - The cookies at turn-down time were very nice. POOL: Excellent - Best hotel pool for us in Singapore so far. My son loved the wading pool and my wife loved the family bean-shaped chair accommodating our family size easily and the cabana (hard to get one due to popularity though). - Drinking water and occasional refreshment given at pool side. - Changing rooms also available.

LOCATION: Very Good - Not directly on top of subway but a short walk through Marina Square/City Link. - Bus stops in front of hotel. - Complimentary shuttle bus to CBD OVERALL: Very Good - The hotel's decor and building probably not worth writing home about but the very nice pool, nice functional room and convenient location made it one of the best all-around hotel for us as a family with a kid.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cStaff maketh the hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ozziepore", "ReviewID": "UR106912296", "Content": "We spent two nights in the MO Singapore.

The view from the bedroom of the harbour and Sands hotel was stunning. I had heard that the pool was fabulous but at first was underwhelmed. However when you spend a few hours poolside you become enchanted. The in-pool beds are so luxurious when it\u2019s hot, and the poolside cabanas (no extra charge) are the epitome of luxury and comfort when it\u2019s drizzling but still very much warm enough to be pool-side. Of course, the view from the pool is also fabulous. The hotel is really rather low-key in comparison with some of Singapore\u2019s other high end luxury hotels, however the art works throughout the building are classy and beautiful and the atrium \u2013 whilst very Marina-Bay 90\u2019s \u2013 is airy and architecturally interesting.

However, when we were shown to our room, the hostess said 'this is one of our most beautiful rooms'. This was a blatant lie as it was just a standard harbour view room. It wasn't an upgrade, it wasn't a suite or a club or a grande so it certainly wasn't one of their most beautiful rooms! Whilst the room is very '1990 Holiday Inn' the view over the harbour is fantastic, I don't think I've stayed in a room with a better view. Room Service is excellent as is concierge and we got into the habit of ordering their club sandwiches which were excellent. One night we pushed the boat out and had dinner in their Chinese Restaurant, The Cherry Garden. Whilst the service was very personable, the food wasn't anything to write home about and to be honest, I've had a better meal from my chinese takeaway. Having said that, afternoon tea at the Axis was delicious. Concierge were faultless apart from the elderly gentlemen who was in charge of putting people into taxis. He twice put us in the wrong taxi! MO did try and charge us for breakfast when it was prepaid. I took this up with reception and she said she would go away and double check. She came back and told me that although my partners breakfast was included, mine wasn't. Now why would I pay for my partners breakfast and not mine!?! I knew only too well that I had prepaid for both breakfasts for the whole 3 days so I found it very frustrating when the reception had told me that they had double checked. I therefore told her to get the manager to call me, Within 5 minutes, the manager called me and told me it was their mistake.

The hotel is quiet, and connected to the Marina Square shopping center, very convenient to get to convenience stores, dining options, MRT...etc. The hotel's staff are all excellent, courteous, and polite. Concierge is brilliant. When we arrived, the reception brought us straight to our rooms for in room check in. With three kids, and a group of 9 people, that was welcomed. We loved the buffet breakfast at the MELT on 4th floor every morning. Food and variety is so good, it's worth waking up to every morning! Each time we ordered a maxi-cab, it was ready within 15 minutes. We went to Sentosa Island, that was fun and easy access from MOSIN, about 15 minutes car ride. Went to Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park, each time we used the hotel car or maxi cab. Our flight was at 7pm, asked for late check out, and the hotel granted our request.

The cleanliness is also an obvious issue there (not so obvious for the management though). Rooms are cleaned well but not perfect, towels you get by the pool are stained (I ask to change and they brought me an even more stained one), and once I even got stained bedsheets in my room (though the management did their best to apologize). I mean, it feels strange when you can't trust a 5* hotel for clean bedsheets and have to check them before getting in bed. The pool is large enough though shallow; it has a perfect view.

My concern was that the room and bath were unimpressive, partly because of some slight but acceptable wear, but primarily because the space simply felt outdated and overdue to be totally reimagined, much like the recent pool transformation. Same could be said for the common areas, especially the hallways, which were just a bit dull. Location is very subjective, but having now been there, I prefer Orchard Road for expanded options and a much more lively scene. Views at the Mandarin can be excellent, but street life is dull and the nearby shopping and dining options inferior to Orchard Road. That said, a cab can whisk you most anywhere in minutes.

Architectuarly something out of the ordinary for sure. We had a room facing the city side but didn't really have too much of a view, but it was very big, clean with comfortable bed and atmosphere. Rooms with views are apparently smaller so its really a personal choice on what you book. The room was always cleaned twice a day with fresh fruit and water bottles, & importantly new towels etc. The staff really look after you here. The swimming pool / outdoor area is pure bliss in an otherwise bustling city and has full harbour/city views. You could happily spend hours a day here if you had the time to spare. Location wise could be better. It is fine if you are catching cabs everywhere, but there is only an older style shopping centre directly next door for daily shopping. Marina Bay sands & the Casino are less than 10 minutes walk though. If you want to shop at the bustling Orchard Road you will need a 10-15 minute cab ride. 20 minutes to the airport. We used the concierge a couple of times who helped us book everything we needed including Jumbo restaurant! The chilli crab was amazing.

It must be very difficult to manage meeting people when they are arriving in your own hotel limo.... Anyway they finally managed to locate us and walked us to the lift to complete all the normal check in procedures in the room. The lift doors opened to a wonderful sight of a completely out of this world drunk, half standing holding a glass of whatever - very uncomfortable ride to the fourth floor where our check in companion happily guided him out of the lift and onto to his next fuel top up at the bar. The hotel is old & tired looking probably 70's or 80's design - Not hard to imagine that with all the development going on around Singapore that they are going to be left behind. Good location. We stayed four nights enjoying the \"club indulgence\" package, the club is nice & big enough to accommodate a large number of guests - they have a furniture layout that places two tables next to each other near the windows. However, they seem to be very reluctant to seat different parties on either of the tables.......that is if there was one person sitting enjoying breakfast at the window they rejected our request to sit at the other free table and instead herded you off to a coffin type room with no windows and zero ambience. They also had two huge lounge set ups that would easily seat 4 to 6 but again if there was one happy camper sitting there already they appeared to accept he had the rightful claim to it all. This sitting regime only served in alienating many guest once they were walked past many empty tables/seats on their way to the coffin. We witness many other people struggling to understand and questioning this strange arrangement. Just a real dampener on what a club environment should be trying to provide guests. On more than one occasion they ran out of glasses & plates - I'm a patient person but after waiting a few minutes for a glass for your refreshing morning juice you don't expect to be handed a scotching hot glass straight out of the dishwasher. The whole club atmosphere and general feel was tortured and unpleasant, the staff seem to be very active playing their role in implementing policy that in our opinion is destroying the very reason guests want to go there. About 3 weeks prior to arriving we had the concierge book three restaurants for us - two were booked without fault with the third completely messed up and contrary to email confirmations that we received before arriving. We have stayed at MO's before & in particular Bangkok and can say with absolute certainty that the Bangkok outfit are brilliant and without peer in that city so I know what the brand can do. Overall our stay was disappointing and not up to high standards we have enjoyed elsewhere around the world.

Ours was a tourist, rather than business trip, and for us the location was good. Great views over the Marina- close proximity to the Singapore flyer and Marina Bay Sands Resort (10 mins walk for each), and the CBD along the river could be reached in around a 20 minute (humid) walk. Cabs were about the only thing cheap in Singapore though, so we also took advantage of them. Great pool area, nice enough rooms, all be it nothing out of the ordinary, and special mention must go to the staff at Melt, who managed the daily breakfast with great professionalism, and I would say was the best feature of the hotel. We used the Spa and also dined at the outdoor Italian restaurant- both of which were nice enough, but the prices were about 20% higher than I had experienced in other comaprable hotels. Same goes for mini bar and room service- both very expensive I felt. Probably our only real gripe was the quality of information we got out of the Concierge desk on the times we used them.

Service was faultless from the moment we arrived from the opening of the car doors to us not having to even touch our luggage and a smooth and pain free check-in. It was great. Then came our room and we had the so called \"standard\" room. It was really lovely. No view to speak of but then we hadn't paid a lot so didn't bother us. The beds were so comfortable, the tv was big with plenty of channels, the bathroom was luxurious with separate shower and a nice big bath tub. The toiletries offered were lovely and even the little things like the freebies in the bathroom were way better than average. I also am quite a light sleeper but I didn't hear a sound from any other room which is what you want from a luxury hotel. Then came the buffet breakfast. Absolutely outstanding. More choice than I have ever seen anywhere (with the exception of Las Vegas and that's saying something). At least 10 different stations offering every kind of breakfast choice imaginable. The swimming pool is something else. It is truly to die for. Huge, clean, luxurious, ample sunloungers and day bed cabanas for those that want to stay away from dangerous rays.

I am just back from 5 nights there with my wife and 6 yo and 3 yo ( I had read all the TA reviews from the last 12 mnths for the top 20 htels in SIN and you always wonder if some of them are fake and added to boost a hotel's rating : THE MO's Rating is CORRECT!) Now we were unusual in that most people who stay here are business people, older couples and honeymooners. We saw only a few families and not many young kids. Having said that the Staff were great with our 2 kids - from the little welcoming gift to always acknowledging them amongst all us adults - now thats courtesy. So why did we choose the MO? 1. service - its was excellent . Yes there were small issues which you can read about in some past reviews but I have a view about these things: \" Small things often make a holiday but small things should never spoil your holiday\" . eg. in The Melt at Breakfast the staff came up with a small child cushion like at the cinema for my 3yo to sit so she could enjoy brekkie better ; never seen that at any 5 star hotel weve been to ( without me asking either). 2. Location steps away from Marina sq , suntec, Flyer , Millenia walk, Gluttons Bay and Esplanade mall - if you stayed a year I bet you could not eat twice at all the food options there were; let alone the 2000+ shops open every night to 10pm. So we could have great hawker food , or the kids got Burger King when they needed it or you could try any number of upmarket restaurants. I think myrm said it best \" You are spoilt for choice\" 3. The pool : if you have kids 6yo and under its the best in singapore hands down. Read the research here on TA and you will find that there is a separate kids pool for this age group , its far enough away from the main pool that you will not be worried about noise that they create and you have your own cabana ( brand new renovation in April 2010) where you can lounge with the free ice water and look a a fabulous view of the bay. Also the pool has multiple jets of water to keep the kids amused for hours. They also have their own lifeguard and personal assistants who make up your cabana or deck chair and basically respond to your every need. Also because there are not many young families you have it all to yourself . Basically the MO was the foundation for a great holiday - will post a Trip report on the main board soon as I learnt so much from TA and am happy to share that experience .", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely incredible service\u201d", "Author": "anthonyuk", "ReviewID": "UR94047189", "Content": "We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore just before Christmas.

I have stayed in other MO's (Praque, for instance), and this one leaves you expecting a bit more. While the room was quite comfortable, and extremely clean, it is a tad on the small side. We did receive an upgrade to a harbor view room, which was nice in that the entire harbor was lit up for the holidays. As we were on the 18th floor, the view was quite spectacular to come home to after a long day out an about. In addition, there are several VERY good concierges, I am sorry I can't remember the name of the one who helped us plan our first few days, but he was extremely professional and knowledgeable. In addition, the breakfast buffet, included in the package we got, was quite extensive, with both extensive oriental and western options to chose from. One major drawback for me is that they charge for wi-fi.

I honestly cannot praise both the hotel and staff highly enough. Upon arrival in the early hours of the morning, we were upgraded from a Mandarin Grand Room to a one bedroom suite - what an unexpected bonus! Our bags were brought promptly to our room and the staff couldnt do enough for us. This level of service was consistent throughout our stay, everywhere from the restaurants, doorman, pool staff and cleaners. We were literally treated like royalty for the entire duration of our stay, and have never experienced anything like it before. Breakfasts were an absolute feast, no matter what your taste in food there is something for everyone. I would suggest making sure that breakfast is included in your room rate/package, as it is well worth the 'extra' cost. Apart from breakfast, we only dined once at the hotel - as to be expected, it is very expensive to eat 'on site'. Taxis are cheap, and the drivers are an absolute wealth of knowledge on where to eat locally, the best seafood places etc etc, and they are very willing to provide lots of local advice on sightseeing, eating etc. We were unsure about tipping, but did in fact give a few extra dollars on every journey and this was greatly appreciated by them (the government has extremely tight controls and regulations on fares and we didnt want to offend by offering a tip if it wasnt the 'done thing'), however they were most appreciative. Our room was very spacious, big bathroom with an extra powder room which was brilliant for teenage daughter. Decor was tasteful and not overdone, and we had fresh flowers in our suite which was a lovely touch.The refurbished pool area is like a scene from a hollywood movie - lots of cushioned private 'cabanas' (think 'arabian nights') complete with their own sound systems. Towels are provided so no need to take your own or the ones from your room. Iced water is continually brought around to you, no need to even ask, and poolside snacks always available (at extra cost). Location of this hotel is great, very close to shopping centres, merlion park and the marina - well worth a visit at night. We were here for 6 nights and felt we hardly scratched the surface of things to see and do. Would recommend a visit to Raffles Hotel (drinks at the Long Bar), however if you want to have 'high tea' in the afternoon book at least a week or more ahead. We didnt realise how popular it would be, and missed out (on the to do list for next time!). A river cruise is also good to get a different perspective of the city. If you like seafood, a taxi ride to East Coast Seafood Centre is a must (about 15 or 20 mins away) for dinner. For perfume dont buy it anywhere except Mustafa in LIttle India - its about half the price of the big shopping centres elsewhere. If you want gold jewellery, Mustafa is also the place to go, it has the hugest range of jewellery in one place i have ever seen. If you are going to Chinatown, try the peking duck at Da Dong Restaurant in Smith street (go upstairs and the owner will look after you). I could go on and on about the Mandarin Oriental, but quite simply it is an awesome place to spend your time in Singapore. Great location and service outstanding. The only gripe i have is that the internet is quite expensive - $150 for 5 days access, which i thought was a bit steep. Would i stay here again?

I think this is THE best business hotel I have ever stayed in, anywhere in the world. Most of the other hotels lack that special touch, the hospitality that doesn't seem like rehearsed, forced or artificial. The people at MO singapore really, really seem like they care about you, they look after you, and they will make it happen. Yes, they GET it. The location of this hotel, while for families may be a bit 'off', is perfect for me. I have stayed in orchard road for all the 50+ trips I made to singapore ever since 1987, and this is really a welcomed escape. I have never seen this side of singapore before and I love it. Close to the CBD and lots of modern, big buildings. Makes you feel like you're in Hong Kong. Being in Orchard makes you close to all you ever need, and close to most of the action, too. One thing I miss staying there is the grocery shop, not the watson but the kind where you can buy meat and chicken for your baby. I have been to marina square, shoppes at marina bay sands, but didn't find any. The concierge told me they have those at carrefour, but not conveniently of walking distance, especially since I have to get the meat everyday. That is of course a very small annoyance and I can just not feed my baby meat or chicken for a few days. Another small annoyance is we booked a connecting room, since my babysitter is travelling with me. Well they made sure we got it, which is good, but the connecting door is LOCKED upon arrival. The bell boy said the reception will get the keys for us, and the reception (after waiting for 10 minutes) said the bellboy will open it. After a while I phoned house keeping and 35 minutes after entering the room, the connecting door is finally opened. For a while all of us and luggage are stuck in one small room. Minor annoyance. The room, as with most rooms in singapore and hong kong, is small. The view (harbour) really, really helps. It was AMAZING. The view of pudong and Hong Kong island is of course better, but this is the best view in singapore. The food is terrific. I thought the food at straits kitchen/grand hyatt room service is good, but this is definitely better. All I ordered (asian section) have been delicious after delicious food, although once I tried the italian, it was so-so. The portion is HUGE so you might want to share it, or waste it. The breakfast buffet was nice, pretty big for singapore I guess but small compared to Jakarta 5 stars like the mulia, and the shangri la. But the quality of the food is very good. Service, as I mentioned was of the highest standard. These filipino staff are really experts! They sure know what they're doing. I have another small annoyance, probably for most of you it doesn't matter but this is the first one for me. When I ordered tikka masala on my last night, the Indian waiter that brought it up to my room had body odor. First time for me. All the other staff in all the hotels in my life never had those. Just a small annoyance. One thing that made this hotel flawed is the beds. The beds are nowhere near 'sleeping on clouds' or 'heavenly'. NO WAY. Westin palace madrid's heavenly bed IS heavenly. Mulia hotel jakarta has fluffly, heavenly beds. These beds are hard and annoying. The pillows are too soft, and the king bed is actually two beds joined together so you can feel 'something' in the middle. It felt like a long, hard, very thin 'pipe' that run across from the head to the foot of the mattress. And my baby is sleeping in the middle, which means he is sleeping on top of this annoying, hard object. Thank God he doesn't mind, but the beds are just plain horrible. I am aware that you can ask for pillows that suit your preference, but it all of the other hotels, I have never need to ask. Shame because beds are the most important thing in a hotel room.

At $380++ for a sea-view room and a glowing \"#1 hotel in Singapore\" it should be the spot for a perfect romantic pamperous weekend. Just felt ripped off the whole time. Friendly service on arrival and throughout the stay, but nothing out of the ordinary for a good hotel.

There is no sauna or plunge pool. It all seems dingy, stale and \"cigar-bar\", un-tropical and not at all built for langorous lounging. the \"massive-bill-at-the-end\" treatments leave you feeling more stressed than when you walked in.

Instead treated ourselves to Straits Kitchen buffet at Hyatt instead and for $40++ per person: presentation alone is worth it. I try not to be a snob - i often stay in budget rooms ($15 -$70 per night depending on the town), orange-carpet motels and love to camp in a tent. have been known to sleep in the car on road trips. but it's all about managing expectations. There are fresher, better places to stay in Singapore, and better value. The city-state itself should probably take a good hard look at itself - i was shocked at how expensive it was since the last time i was there (about 4 months ago). with the US dollar relatively low and sing$ inflated you'll get stellar bang for your buck on a long weekend in bali, bangkok, kl and even HK.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cVery good 5 star, but not amazing\u201d", "Author": "love2travelTokyo", "ReviewID": "UR84706124", "Content": "Stayed here 3 nights whilst visiting for a friend's wedding (which was also held in the MO).

So you have to be reliant on taxis, and sometimes the queue is very long. - Generally starting to feel a little old, especially in the rooms. I think it is about 5 years away from the need for a major refurb. - Some of the rooms have very ordinary views....and require a super long trek from the elevator to get to (obviously mine was one of those!)...and some rooms are actually quite small Compared to the very funky and chic Landmark MO in HK, this is 2nd class. And it doesn't have the opulence and history of the Bangkok MO or the HK Original MO. I think it needs a full renovation within the next 5 years to still be world class.

This was a vast improvement from his initial attitude: he had bared his teeth with ill-concealed anger when I insisted that he fit all my luggage into the trunk of his taxi, rejecting his ridiculous suggestion that I employ his friend to carry my bags to the Hotel in a separate cab. With the first mention of the Mandarin he brightened up as visions of an oversized tip from Americans able to afford the Mandarin began dancing around his pea brain. He was disappointed. No-one gets tipped for baring their teeth at me. Upon arrival at the Mandarin the reception desk attempted a stunt unworthy of a flop house, let alone a legendary hotel. I had carefully booked a room with a king bed and had a confirmation to prove it. As my Dearest and I approached reception, I heard another guest complain bitterly that a promised king bed had not materialized. Grinning from ear to ear the receptionist who assisted my Dearest and me announced that we had been upgraded to a suite. \u2018Do you accept upgrade\u2019 the receptionist asked several times with growing vehemence. Smelling a rat, I signaled to my Dearest that he was to remain silent and asked our receptionist whether the suite contained a king bed. Caught out, the receptionist admitted that the suite contained just two twin beds: information that should have been shared upfront. We stuck with our king bed room, thank you! The Singaporean cabbie and I differ on what is the stuff of legend. While undoubtedly a premium businessperson\u2019s hotel, the Mandarin Oriental Singapore falls well short of legendary: (1) On roughly half the occasions that I called the Hotel guest services line it was answered within three rings. Other times it rang and rang endlessly until I slammed the phone down fuming. Legendary hotels staff their guest services lines with enough people so that all guest calls are answered promptly. My friends calling from home reported being put on hold for long stretches by Hotel operators, which is inconsiderate if you consider the cost of a phone call from America to Singapore. (2) Twice the guest services line attendant entirely misunderstood my request. Legendary hotels make sure everyone answering guest services calls is fluent in the American language. (3) Much of the furniture in the room consisted of bulky chunks of particle-board covered with wood veneer. Legendary hotels offer solid wood furniture. The upholstery in the room was uncomfortable and stained. Not something a businessperson running to the next meeting might notice, but something I spotted immediately. (4) In the world of hotels, there is lovely marble with rich colors, large tiles, almost invisible seams between tiles, and patterns that flow continuously from one tile to the next (luxury). There is also cheapo marble with dull colors, small tiles, prominent seams between tiles and unconnected patterns on each tile (not luxury). The marble in the Mandarin bathroom fell in the cheapo category. Worse, it bore glaring plastering and patchwork repairs where former bathroom fixtures had been ripped out. (5) The seams in the wallpaper were far too obvious and in some spots the wallpaper was starting to pull apart. Many bits of wall were scratched, stained, and scuffed. The Hotel restaurants and bars were generally nice. Wide variety of tasty food. Cocktails made skillfully, as ordered and without fuss. Superb waitstaff who could always tell whether I was in a rush or wanted to linger over my meal. My Dearest asks me to mention that the business center was exceptional and made the impossible possible several times. Point noted, my Dearest, but if you planned effectively you would not need to ask hotel business centers to yank rabbits out of hats for you. A stay at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore is not hardship duty: the Mandarin is a well run high-end hotel with many nice amenities. It is especially well suited to business travel. But legendary?

The service we encountered was impeccable, efficient and very friendly from the moment we checked in to the day we left. The concierge was very helpful with trip planning and offering advice on local transport. The location is excellent and there are two MRT stations within a 10 minute walk all of which can be done undercover with air conditioning if you don\u2019t fancy the heat. There were always taxis outside and guests are given priority if there is a line. We booked a Marina view room and I can recommend paying the extra for the view which spanned from the new Marina Bay Sands round to the St.Andrews Cathedral and included the CBD which is spectacular at night. The F1 GP track was being built as we were there 3 weeks before race day and the hotel is opposite turn 16 so we could see the track develop during our time there. The room was very well equipped and spacious enough for the two of us with all the amenities one would expect from a 5 star hotel. My only gripe about the room is the high charge for wi-fi. Buy yourself a prepay dongle if you are there for more than a few days, it\u2019s much better value. The turndown service at night is worth a mention as the whole room is freshened up, new towels, robes, soap etc, in fact anything which needs changing gets changed and a book mark is always left as a gift. There are so any places to eat in Singapore and we were out in the City so much that we only ate in the hotel once. The Cherry Garden restaurant specialises in Cantonese cooking and was enjoyable if a little expensive as are most of the dining options available inside the MO. We really would have liked to have eaten at Morton\u2019s the Steakhouse but the pricing really was sky high so we gave it a miss. There is very much better value to be had eating at one of the joining shopping malls. The Morton\u2019s bar is quite nice and very busy during happy hour but unfortunately it closes at 11pm leaving only the Axis bar which reminded me of a business class lounge at the airport. The service is good though as are the cocktails and a pleasant way to end an evening out. If you don\u2019t eat much for breakfast may I suggest you just pay the room only rate and make a good saving by eating out. There is a great place called Kopi-O for breakfast just a 2 minute walk from the front entrance of the hotel across the road at the entrance to the Esplanade Theatre. Peanut butter toast and coffee for two for around \u00a35! Special mention should be made of the swimming pool. I know this has been updated this year and it\u2019s really been done very well. The service is really quick and once your sun bed has been made up and towels given out some iced water is provided which given the heat and humidity is most welcome. There are some good views of the city sky line from many of the sun beds some of which are actually in the pool so you can relax in the water!", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant hotel, great service .

Rooms are very cozy and equipped with everything you need. Room service is perfect. Room was serviced twice a day (not just turndown - real service also in the evening). Always very clean and stocked with everything (e.g. this is the only hotel in the world in wich I never ever run out of facial tissues). Restaurants / Bar We had dinner at Cherry Garden (chinese): Wonderful. At Wasabi Bistro (japanese): very good and very good choice in menues. Melt: Breakfast is unbeatable and cannot be described; Buffet dinner was top. Dolce vita (italian): By the pool with view of the skyline; Wonderful service, very good food. We did not have dinner at Morton's as the prices are obviously too high. But... the daily highlight was Axis Bar. There we really felt like home and the Service is 7 stars! Pool The whole pool area has undergone renovation and is now a little place of heaven. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great facilities - also in the gym. Concierge Very helpful and very competent. We booked tickets thru them and service was very quick and matched exactly our needs. Also all doormen and the \"taxi-man\" are top. Location Singapore is now quite a big city.

Given how long the property had been around, and the relatively low corporate rate I'd gotten I honestly didn't have particularly high expectations. I was set straight but good. Upon arrival, the hotel had done a nice job of landscaping the open driveway in front of the hotel. Upon arrival, I was escorted and my bags whisked to the front desk. There was no line at 8-9 pm, and the attendant was very friendly, efficient and generally solicitous of my well-being. The structural design of the hotel was very early 90s, but the touches and finishings by the hotel made it seem attractive, recently renovated, and actually quite luxurious. My room size was typical of that era, but of a reasonable size (I'd estimate 30-40sqm) and the space was cleverly broken up by a long bathroom with the closets along the side and a glass partition to the main bedroom. The chocolates left for their guests were delicious, and the fruits were very sweet and a nice touch. The location of the hotel is great - I was able to be at a conference in the nearby Ritz-Carlton in 5 minutes by just taking some stairs up one flight to the mall and then cutting through it to the 1st floor entrance to the Ritz. It's close to the subway, to lots of shopping, and it was walking distance to the Marina Bay Sands (if you don't mind a 15-20 minute walk along the spectacular pedestrian bridge). Great location for joggers. And you can even take in a show at the Esplanade next door (hit the No Signboard seafood for pepper crab or chili crab if you don't have time to go to the East Coast). And the breakfast buffet was the most impressive I'd seen in a very long time.

Aside from the dress code, I was most upset by the manner in which the staff dealt with the situation. Staff response was aggressive, rude, confrontational and without a polite closing note. Tip for staff: if you want to enforce a dress code, then 1. make sure it's sensible for venue/time/location/guest situation; 2. have the policy clearly visible or at least somewhere you can direct to in a professional manner; 3. explain the policy respectfully and apologise; 4. encourage the guests to come back (\"sorry for the inconvenience, but if you would like to return later this evening, we'd like to offer your party a complimentary drink/voucher/discount/something for your inconvenience\").

Essentially the hotel really has been built out very nicely and every corner has a pleasant hotel ambience.

Mention Mandarin Oriental and it conjures up images of the exotic east, luxurious accommodation steep in culture and design and impeccable personalized service. So confident is the hotel group on it\u2019s image that it even pioneer the \u201cI\u2019m a fan\u201d campaign with prominent celebrity endorsement. The Mandarin Oriental Singapore is a more dated property among the MO portfolio but has a prime harbour-side location at Singapore\u2019s the Marina Bay area. Arriving I have always prefer hotels at Marina Bay area due to it\u2019s proximity to the airport. I have tried Pan Pacific, Marina Mandarin, Ritz Carlton and Conrad already. This time, I decided to try out the Mandarin Oriental. Arriving by taxi, I was escorted to the reception desk and check-in formalities was efficiently handled without any waiting. A good first impression. I was also glad to hear that they have upgraded me to a suite. The Room The suite room is a spacious 73m2 city suite which at first glance, looks rather quite functional, with calm, relaxing d\u00e9cor. The suite is neatly divided into a living area and a sleeping quarters with a king size bed, connected to a marble bathroom and a walk-in closet. Strangely missing though is a dinning area but I can understand including that will make the place too crowded. There is a long working desk with plugs and connections conveniently located at the side. Wireless and wired internet works and quite fast. There\u2019s a large 40\u201d LCD TV which is hooked up a in-room A/V system, but it\u2019s rather basic and sound, well\u2026 like most A/V system in hotel sounds, ie mediocre. ( Note : I\u2019m a A/V enthusiast so my standards are higher than usual ). There\u2019s no iPod dock but the hotel provide some cables to hook up the iPod manually, a rather un-elegant solution in this day and age. The lighting is not flexible. While there\u2019s no mood lighting, at least separate light switches should be provided. Instead the main switches just either switches everything on or everything off. Above the working desk is a glaring spot light that cannot be switched off without switching off every other light, which is quite annoying. Sound proof isn\u2019t that great either. I can hear street noise coming thru the windows which I suspect isn\u2019t double-glazed, hence the noise. The bed is quite comfortable but not exactly top of the line for a hotel of this class. The bathroom I think is the most undesirable part of this suite. For a suite room, it\u2019s surprising small and the bathroom fittings are a mixture of old and new. And again, there is this dreadful shower-stall with only a single shower head and low water pressure that makes one feel like taking a bath under a water tap. Seriously, hotels of this class should by now have installed mandatory rainforest showers in their bathrooms. The bathtub is deep which is good but I find it rather narrow. Overall, this room is showing it\u2019s age and while it has been refreshed and touch-up before, such as installing flat panel LCD Tvs, it\u2019s basically still resembles a hotel room from the late 80s / early 90s period, ie old and un-appealing. Common Areas The most impressive common area feature of this hotel is the soaring 24th storey atrium, which is especially majestically when viewed from the 4th level. Sort of shape like a fan, a symbol of the Mandarin Oriental group. There are a couple of restaurants in the hotel but I only visited the caf\u00e9 for the morning breakfast. There\u2019s a large morning crowd and it was rather noisy, not very nice ambience. The food served was OK, standard hotel breakfast stuff. Service I used to have high expectation of Mandarin Oriental service, which are often exemplary especially among their two signature hotels in Hong Kong and equally good in Bangkok but have since toned down my expectation after an awful stay at Mandarin Oriental Tokyo 2 years ago. The service here in Mandarin Oriental Singapore is not as bad but woefully inconsistent. During my stay, I encountered some staff that seems to be trying out of their way to be friendly and helpful ( but at the wrong occasion ) and some being rather indifferent and some that are downright rude. Case in point, I arrived late at night, was tired after the flight and ordered room service because I just want a quick meal before my bedtime. The room service attendant that brought me my food was being overtly attentive, hanging around longer than usual, asking how he might be of service and trying to strike up some small conversations which I was frankly in no mood for. I wasn\u2019t quite sure if he wanted a tip or just trying to be nice. A case of \u201cover service\u201d perhaps? Then the follow day, it goes to the other extreme during morning breakfast that when trying to order an egg omelet, I was rudely told to \u201cwait in line\u201d by a very grumpy looking staff because apparently, there was another hotel guest waiting for her order but I didn\u2019t noticed any queue forming. Fortunately, the restaurant manager was on-hand to help me take my order so I don\u2019t have to stare at a sour face the first thing in the morning. Conclusion During my short stay at this hotel, I went away unimpressed. Granted I was given an upgrade to a suite, but I really don\u2019t find anything particularly outstanding about this hotel in where it counts. Comparing against other hotels in Singapore, in terms of room quality, it is a step down from the grand and luxurious St Regis. In terms of service, it\u2019s inconsistent at best and definitely not comparable to the Four Seasons which has class and finesse.

The hotel is conveniently located, within walking distance or a short cab ride to most of the city's attractions. Although we did not have the opportunity to swim, the hotel pool area (which I understand was recently renovated) is absolutely gorgeous. Our only minor complaint was that the concierge had little to recommend restaurant-wise, apart from the main, nearby tourist spots. For example, when we mentioned that we went to Geylang (the red-light district) to eat at its No Signboard Seafood, rather than eat at the No Signboard in the Esplanade, he seemed both shocked and appalled, despite the fact that we had been advised by several local Singaporeans that the Geylang restaurant is far superior in terms of both quality and price. So, if you're looking for local finds or places off the beaten path, do your own research!

The hotel is huge with 80's-style cylindrical glass elevators in the center of an atrium surrounded by all the guest rooms. Sound carries real well so when a 7 year-old on the other side of the hotel yells \"C'mon Grandpa!\" at 6:30 AM you will hear it and you will be awake. Elevators serve every floor so they are very slow (sometimes 5 minutes from lobby to your room - this is really not great if you are hot, tired, have to \"go\" etc - which is almost all the time in SIN). In addition to being slow, cars are very small so you will become well-acquainted with your fellow guests (like it or not). Typical Mandarin Oriental-type room, lots of chintz, unneccesarily complicated lighting system, the bath the looks luxe at first but on closer inspection is a little tired and in need of a reno. Pool, though, has had a recent makeover and is stunning, one of the best in Asia - view to the rear of the Singapore Flyer and from the front over to tall skyscrapers, The Fullerton, and one of the Merlions - a real photo op. Poolside service gets the balance right between solicitiousness and leaving you alone. Pool swarmed with not-too-well-supervised kids on the weekends, however, so not as relaxing or peaceful as it should be - stone on the pool deck is pretty slippery which can result in a little rough justice for the real misbehavers. Hotel location near The Esplanade is a key plus. Everybody in SIN is a food critic so some will turn up their noses but for us the Makansutra Gluttons Bay outdoor hawker centre and the No Signboard Seafood branch were all we needed for darn satisfying weekend dining. The hawker centre was particularly great - halal food (at least some of it), icy Tiger beer, open til 3 AM - that's SIN in a splendid nutshell. Service in the Axis Lounge was very poor however and a real visit killer. It was our anniversary and after a delicious but economical white pepper crab dinner, we decided to celebrate with a nice bottle of vintage champagne (US$300+). Server insisted on pouring thimble-size amounts, spilling quite a bit each time. When we said nicely we would like to pour for ourselves, she told us \"the Boss wants me to pour\" - this sort of thing happens a lot in Asia but is infuriating every time nonetheless Instead of getting the service you want, you get service forced upon you based upon someone's zombie-like tunnel-vision view of what that service should be. Service like that absolutely ignores the customer's wishes as an individual and, honestly, at $300 a bottle - the customer should be \"the Boss.\" By the end, the poor girl with the phantom \"Boss\" hovering over her shoulder had spilled just about a full glass. Profuse apologies were given, but the situation called for 2 complimentary glasses of the house champagne . . . we got nothing but the check.

All for free. Add free wi-fi, which actually works good all the time and you got yourself great business value. The staff is extremely friendly, they remember your name immediately and remember your \"usuals\" (would you like a double espresso, sir?\"). They never say no, they try to facilitate even the oddest requests. Rooms are well kept, the amenities are fine, but the furniture is relatively plain. The TV has surround sound and you can plug your iPod to the TV (all cables in the room) and listen to your music while taking a shower. The bar is good and they even had live jazz music on the weekend. The Italian restaurant by a Michelin star chef is great (it's \"okay\" if you're used to European haute cuisine) and the hotel restaurant where they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner is better than expected. If you're a formula one fan this should be a good location for you, because the track runs right around the hotel. But the location is convenient even if you're not there for the race.

I was a \"giant fan\" of the mandarin oriental hotels always basing my next holiday destination on where there hotels are located around the world HOWEVER the Mandarin in Singapore is a complete disappointment. Here is a run down of my disappointments with the hotel; 1. Its chinese new year so I requested a sea view room to enjoy the fireworks- however the hotel upgraded me to a room them deemed 'better' which is in the back of the hotel and had a terrible view of the backside of another building. When I requested the room I wanted I was told there wasn't one available and I would be stupid to want to change/ downgrade rooms. 2. When checking in I was told my room rate had increased from 325 to 619 Singapore dollars. I had to contact my travel agency twice and then forward on my reservation by email to hotel which consequently cost me the difference as I need to pay for the hotels insanely expensive internet service as well as having to make long distance phone calls. 3. The concierge at the Mandarin in Singapore is a joke. At 10am I requested that the conceirge could make me a reservation for a restaurant that evening! At 530pm I received a note from the concierge saying that the restaurant stops taking reservations after 3pm as its an automated online something or other and I would not get a reservation, however I asked for help at 10am! I therefore contacted the restaurant personally and had no issues making a reservation at 7. Cleanliness; The hotel is spot on. Its very clean. Location; The hotel is very convenient Rooms; A total disappointment. I was told the hotel has just undergone a major refurbishment however the rooms were nothing special. Value; Abysmal Sleep quality; At least the bed and the bed sheets were nice. After crying myself to sleep I slept great. The swimming pool area was also a construction site with half of pool area roped of and with construction dust blowing into your face. FANtastic I personally love the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain. I frequent many of their hotels around the world however my experience at this hotel has left me rather jaded.

It brags a consistent oriental atmosphere with glamour and richness of Indo-China region and we loved it! We stayed in one of the rooms on the club floor for the Christmas. The room was spacious, and the furniture and fabrics show extraordinary taste of the region. Shining dark wood, elegantly colorful embroidery- Just delicous. And it had a window wall facing the seaside with Fullerton and Merlion in the view. The view gets fantastic at night. You don't want to fall asleep. The welcome tea and fruit was also beautifully set. They also have hung on the door knob a cute mini bag with a paper Christmas tree decorated with tiny beads on the surface. It had some chestnuts in it, implying the season. The breakfast was superb! And if you stay on the club floor, you can be served breakfast in the club lounge, too.

The bathroom was immaculately clean with separate bath and shower. It would have been nice to have rain shower heads though. The breakfast buffet at Melt was overwhelming, providing a myriad of delicious choices from Continental to Chinese to Indian breakfast fare. And the swimming pool, though a little too plain, was a great place to lounge and chill under the hot Singapore sun. The complimentary water, sorbet and fruits served made the experience even more delightful. The hotel is located a bit out of the way from major places of interest in Singapore like Orchard Road, the Civic Centre, etc. It's about a ten-minute walk to the nearest subway station. But this gives it a bit of that exclusivity factor. And besides, immediate areas like The Esplanade and Marina Square provide great places to hang out at night. The rooftop bar at the Esplanade is particularly a wonderful spot to chill and spend time with friends amidst the spectacular views of the harbor. As mentioned, the best part of the hotel is the exceptional service. The staff never fails to make you feel special, whether you're having breakfast at Melt or reading your favorite book by the poolside or simply just entering the hotel. Everyone is polite, pleasant and is always willing to please. The staff at the poolside were especially commendable, offering to open the umbrella shade and giving out complimentary goodies every now and then.

We selected the Hotel based on its high Trip Advisor ranking and wanting to experience staying in a different location having spent four nights staying in the boutique Scarlet Hotel in Chinatown earlier in our holiday. We had booked an airport / hotel car transfer through the Hotel before our holiday. In hindsight we would have been better to have organised our own transport as the charge was considerably more than we had paid for the same service to the Scarlet, however this was offset somewhat by the cheaper room rate. Taxis are so cheap and well regulated in Singapore, that private airport transfers are not really necessary anyway. The Hotel is located at the business end of town, so is probably not the best position for accessing the Orchard road shopping malls, and the nearest MRT station is a fair walk. Within 6 months however the huge new Marina Bay Casino complex will open nearby which will dramatically change the dynamic of this area, and this will also include a new MRT station within easier access to the Hotel. The property is certainly typical of the old style American Hotels popular in the 80\u2019s, but the rooms have relatively new furnishings, and are large and comfortable. The service was very friendly and professional, check in formalities were completed in our room while our luggage was delivered. There are a number of restaurants within the Hotel which as foodies we found to be either too expensive or uninspiring, so we ended up dining in the Lighthouse Restaurant located on top of the nearby Fullerton Hotel. The nightime view was spectacular, matched by the quality of the service and the excellent food. The next morning we also discovered a number of restaurants within walking distance along a short street connecting the Millenia and Suntec shopping malls behind our Hotel. The Hotel breakfast buffet in the morning was certainly one of the most extensive we have experienced, however its popularity is its downfall, it was so busy that there were long queues waiting to be seated and also at the chefs egg cooking station. Fortunately there were so many food choices, alternatives were easy to find. One of the highlights of our trip was experiencing a fish foot massage (located on the overpass connection between Millenia tower and Marina square adjacent to the Hotel).

Wasn't impressed with the hotel pool, just a bit too stark and small, so we regrettably never used it. Staff were brilliant, always smiling and making you feel special, they looked amazing too. The meals we had were outstanding and we were very pampered, but they were expensive. Annoyed not to be able to have free internet usage, in fact, if we had of had that I doubt we would have used the club at all - it was the only place you could get it.

Negatives * We were waken up at 8:30am on Christmas day with the noise of a jack hammer above our hotel room. On contacting reception, we were told they were unaware of any renovations above our room and would get back to us. We were granted a room change, although the whole process took 2 hours to be completed. During our swim in the evening, we could clearly see that all the rooms on the 12 floor of the building facing the harbour had been covered with a a white tarpaulin \u2013 renovations maybe?? We asked one of the pool staff and she said that the renovations were started a week ago and would continue to the new year!! How in world can reception in a 5 star hotel not know which rooms are under renovation and why would they put a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary (or any guest for that matter) underneath a room being renovated? Truly unforgivable! * Not all reception and concierge staff were fluent in English. * Breakfast was a bit of a mad house, especially if you wanted an omelet. * Location may be convenient if you are a business traveller with a convention at Suntec city, but a tourist would need to walk for about 15 minutes to the MRT at Raffles Place. Singapore Flyer is within easy reach though. * The hotel did previously have a brilliant view of Marina Bay, but with the construction of a new football stadium in the bay has significantly affected this view. Unfortunately we will never return to this hotel in Singapore. I would suggest the Grand Hyatt Singapore over this hotel in terms of service, location and comfort anytime.

The friendly staff give exceptional service and remember your preferences. One day a small girl was in the cafe and the chef in the pancake area made and decorated a pancake in the shape of Mickey Mouse and personally delivered it to her at her table.

It is a quick taxi or train ride to Boat Harbour, Clarke Quay and Orchard Road. We arrived very early in the morning and they gave us a room straight away (7 hours before check-in time).

The room was 5 star - it had everything we needed and more (including free bottled water, fruit, newspaper and toiletries such as a toothbrush & toothpaste, shaver, loofa, etc).

As far as wireless connection is concerned, the hotel replied to my feedback advising that they check with other hotels to make sure they are competitive and they find that their prices are so.

Let me just say that I have always been impressed with the accomodations, staff, level of service, professionalism and quality of this hotel. Its biggest detraction is its location which is just some distance from most things. Again the room was great (see pictures) with a nice big lounge and balcony area. Quite a modern feel and the large flat panel TV and DVD player in the lounge and the bedroom was most useful. The fruit basket, chocolates and evening wine were also a wonderful touch and very much appreciated (and consumed). Also the rooms have lovely big bathrooms with great amenities and wonderful towels (not a big deal unless they are old and scratchy!!). The turndon service is also excellent. Special mention has to go to breakfast at Melt. Although it can be very busy, the food offerings are amazing and always excellent. Added to this is the grace and courteousness of the staff who never fail to disappoint. There is a reason why this hotel rates so highly on trip advisor. It is consistently good and most often excellent.

The hotel is beautiful inside, very stylish and the staff outstanding. My name was remembered by several members of staff who possibly only met me once previously and i was made to feel extremely welcome and very well looked after.

In racking my thoughts, i really couldn't find fault with anything at all.

The Mandarin (like the Ritz) is located in an area that, to get anywhere, you must take a taxi, so make sure this does not bother you. It was, however, an issue for me. Though there is a mall that is connected to the hotel, it wasn't a particularly nice mall. This is the main (and probably only) reason why I will not stay here again. So let me preface my review by saying, consider this a critique of the location and not of the hotel. In terms of the hotel itself, the Mandarin is nice. Like the property in Hong Kong, it has an understated elegance, though one area I really disliked is the structure of the walkway to the rooms--- it felt very impersonal, like a business hotel, i.e. a Hyatt. For me, the first impression wasn't very good. My feelings did get warmer as we arrived at our room. We stayed on the executive floor and the room was lovely. A large ceiling to floor window that overlooks the harbor area and a glass partition that separates bathroom from the sleeping area, very modern and designy. High quality fabric slippers and all the amenities you could think of (including a loofah sponge, nice touch). I wonder if I'm the only one but what I continuously find irritating is that Internet is not offered free of charge. It seems to be the case with most 5-star hotels these days, but hopefully that will change.

I marvel at how management trains its staff, as it clearly shows in their friendliness, attention to detail and initative. The service alone makes me want to return on my next visit to Singapore. The excellent service is evident everywhere in the hotel, but especially in the restaurant, where I enjoyed several delectable buffet breakfasts. Speaking of the breakfast buffet, the MO's spread certainly ranks among the 3 best I have ever eaten, almost on par with the Shangri-la Kuala Lumpur and the JW Marriott Jakarta. Rooms are not the most spacious, and for the prices charged by the MO, I would certainly expect more. However, they are still very quiet, beautifully decorated, and with the usual extensive selection of TV channels, and expensive Internet access. In this day and age, I am disappointed that the MO still charges for Internet access, and a lot at that - S$30 per day, whereas it's free at all Shangri-la hotels and resorts. One of the loveliest aspects of staying at the MO is its architecture - guests soar up the enormous atrium in glass elevators, which makes one feel as if one is flying. Breathtaking. The rectangular swimming pool is perfect for lap swimming (as I love doing every morning), complete with a lane marker. The gym is above-average, with new equipment, but could be improved with a greater selection of weights and apparatus. MO is one of 3 hotels atop Marina Square, a retail complex with countless shopping and dining options, which is in turn linked to the nearby Raffles City complex via an airconditioned subterranean walkway. To get to Orchard Road, a taxi will cost around S$6 (taxis are cheap, clean and plentiful in Singapore), while the Mass Rapid Transit subway trains provide cheap and easy access almost anywhere. Aside from breakfast at the Melt World Cafe, I didn't try any of the MO's restaurants, which include a Morton's Steakhouse and a Chinese restaurant.

There is no real place to people watch or just to relax and have a drink however what The Oriental may lack in this area it makes up for in friendly staff who greet you constantly as you go up to your room.

There were lovely flower decorations and I was impressed by the decor of the elevators which was very intricate and unusual. Check in - Check in was very smooth and we had no problems. Staff were very efficient and there was virtually no wait involved. Room - We REALLY loved our room! Even though we had a standard room, it was larger than an average hotel room with a little lounge and desk. Despite having three people in one room, it did not feel cramped. The bed was amazingly comfortable, possibly the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bedding was like velvet against the skin! Pillows were just the right softness too. The bathroom was luxurious and packed with soaps and shampoos.

So all in all, our room was fantastic and we were very happy! Dining - Some of the best food I have ever tried was at The Oriental. The first night we ate at Dolce Vita where I had a tasty pasta dish. What really took the cake was the MELT ~ World Caf\u00e9 which we ate at every morning. The wide variety of food, the high quality of ingredients, the attention to detail... everything was wonderful. Every morning we were greeted by name by the friendly hosts and led to our table. I loved the Indian section and often gorged myself on the curries. I also loved the fruit bar which had really fresh ingredients and you could make up whatever combination of drink you wanted! I am a huge chocolate fan so I made use of the chocolate fountain which of course was delicious. One fault I did find is that my freshly made pancakes were rather gluggy and stodgy but this is a minor point. Loved the food! Unfortunately we didn't get to eat at the Cherry Garden or the Steakhouse (as we are vegeterian) but I was completely satisfied with the Melt. So good! Room service - After a long day of sight seeing we decided to indulge in a three course room service meal for dinner. We were really impressed by the professionalism of the waiter who folded out a table for us which was equipped with a freezer. We had napkins, plenty of cutlery and the food was still piping hot. I throughly enjoyed my meal which was incredibly filling. Staff - The staff are so enthusiastic and helpful, we we really impressed with all the staff, from the people who open the doors, to the waiters to those on reception. We didn't encounter one member of staff who was ill-tempered. The maids always said hello to us. The staff made our stay truly terrific. Pool - Although the pool itself is nothing to write home about as it is not very big, it was big enough and generally very quiet when we were there. I didn't like how the resturant overlooked the pool as I felt I was on show but the view overlooking the city from the pool is amazing. Location - Very convenient for access to Marina Square and the MRT. We had no problems getting anywhere. We throughly enjoyed our stay and would go back in a heartbeat!", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGlitzy Elegance\u201d", "Author": "michellevoyager", "ReviewID": "UR34884928", "Content": "We checked in here for a night on transit.

When you are on holiday for leisure rather than being a business customer as most bill as are settled by companies you appreciate things more. Nothing is to much trouble for the staff who serve you with a smile always. If you get the chance take a club harbour room which has glorious views over the harbour and the city too. The club class lets you have breakfast, all day soft drinks and afternoon tea & cookies then evening tit bits and cocktails. The spread that is served and the drinks have to be seen to be believed. The pool are is one of the best in the world we have been to as in the staff are so attentive with towels, iced friut, iced drinks and iced flannels at regular intervals. From the time you arrive and they know your name till the time you leave everything about your stay is logged in there minds and computers no doubt to ensure they serve you with what you like. This was our 4th year in the Mandarin Oriental and when we holiday in Singapore we would not stay anywhere else. Even a free room at Raffles well maybe !!!! Melvis and the girls in the club class need a mention as without them the Mandarin Oriental would not be the place it is today.

The room was generous with a lounge and desk and extremely clean plus they even had made a little baby pack for my daughter and provided a child robe and slippers for my son which i was impressed with. I had breakfast at Melt with my 4 yo and 2 yo, while my husband went to work and the staff there were so helpful the choice of food was amazing, one of the best buffet breakfasts I have been to. The location is great as it's connected to marina square (which connects to suntec) via the carpark or stairs outside the hotel, which is really convenient. If you walk straight through the carpark there are quite a few breakfast places as well which is really handy. My husband used the Oriental Club lounge for work in the morning before his meetings and he said it was very good. The pool on level 5 is fantastic again with excellent service. there is a children's pool and another bigger pool. As soon as we sat down on the lounges we were given bottles of water straight away and the kids were given pool toys to play with. We were there for only 1 hour at the pool and were provided scented cold face towels, a small cup of ice cream and a small cup of jelly each as a little snack - all complimentary. On our 2nd night we all fell sick with the flu and the dr had to ring the authorities to ensure it was not swine flu. We were then tested and quarantined in our hotel room till the results came back. The hotel went above and beyond our expectations by upgrading us again to a junior suite whereby we had a lounge room and a separate bedroom with 2 bathrooms, so that our quarantined stay would be more comfortable. The front office manager Amit was so fantastic with the service he provided. Once we went into our new room he had arranged for snacks, boxes of soft drinks, baby/toddler food, boxes of bottled water, cereal, an xbox for my son to play with, kids dvds, kids books and toys to be placed in our suite to make it as comfortable for us as possible - all complimentary. It was just unbelievable. Obviously we ordered a lot of room service as we were not allowed out of the hotel room and the food was delicious. Once our results came back negative Amit had said we could stay in the room for as long as we needed. When we checked out at reception Amit personally farewelled us and wished us the best.

But after a few hours out in the heat and humidity, the cool, shady tranquility was very welcome. The pool area is fantastic. Both days we were there we went for twilight swim and loved the views of the city. Again, fantastic service with towels and a little bottle of water brought to your lounger. The breakfast was fine, although we slept so well in the comfy bed that we nearly overslept and missed it. On the second day we had an early start so had the room service breakfast. Again, superb. Especially the freshly squeezed carrot juice and the tropical fruit plate. The cocktail bar on floor 5 was a real treat. Stylish but not pretentious, never-ending complimentary nuts and rice crackers, and a great mango marguerita. And tremendous city views. The area is great.

We loved the No Signboard seafood restaurant. Other things we loved- the waterside bars in front of the Fullerton Hotel, really cool and trendy at the weekend.

Great location.Walking distance to all the main attractions and shopping malls. The rooms are quite big.The 42' TV with good quality sound was a big plus!The bathroom was big enough and was beautifully finished in Italian marble. What I loved the most was the bed.It's heavenly.I was looking forward to taking a well deserved rest after a long day of shopping and sightseeing.The bed did the trick.The pillows were just right.Perfect for insomniacs like me. We wanted to try the spa,but we didn't have enough time. All in all an excellent hotel.One of the best I've ever stayed in!

Before the trip I did lots of research and considered also the Raffles, the Ritz-Carlton and the Shangri, but decided on the MO. And that was the best decision, we were most happy with the hotel! We took a limo taxi from the airport (about 18 euros) and were checked-in in our upgraded City suite (with Club services). We had a bottle of red wine, green tea, fresh fruit and bottled water (both replenished every day) and beautiful fresh flowers in the room. The suite had a large living room, a suitably sized bedroom, a dressing area, a guest wash room, a marble bathroom with a separate shower (and lovely Elemis toiletries, a big plus!). We had two large tv's and two entrances as well. There's lovely art all over the hotel, also in the rooms. The windows are from floor to ceiling. The club services included: a champagne breakfast, an afternoon tea, evening coctails with lots of things to eat (both warm and cold, a theme every night (loved the Indian especially), well chosen French cheeses, and Moet, of course). Soft drinks all day, pressing of two items per day, late check-out until 8 PM, newspaper delivered every morning etc .etc.. The service in the hotel is exceptional all over, but especially at the Club. You can naturally use a PC, fax etc.; read magazines and books in the Club. We liked the pool area, there were always vacant sun loungers and umbrellas. The nice young men were most helpful, they bring you fresh bottled water, fruit and sherbet and even clean your sunnies, if you wish! The pool is open from early morning to late evening. There's a really nice view to the city, the Merlion etc. from the pool area. You can also see the Singapore \"eye\" on the other side near the Ritz-C. As the sea is next to the hotel there's sometimes a welcome light breeze from the sea. There's a kiddie pool, but unfortunately some parents bring their small kids who can't swim (and who make lots of noise) in the adult pool. Scary! Fortunately this was not daily and normally the pool area was an oasis of calm. Altough you can stuff yourself with the delicasies at the Club, the restaurants are well worth visiting as well. My favourite was the Dolce Vita (I'd come back to Singapore for the truffle risotto only) , the Cherry Garden was excellent and the more casual MELT was nice as well. All restaurants had good food and excellent service. The Cherry Garden is very nicely decorated. The housekeeping at the hotel is exceptional. The room and the public areas are spotless. Nothing was ever missing in the room like in some other top hotels we have stayed in, on the contrary the amenities were ambly replenished every day. I sent my \"travel trousers\" for laudry and they had also resewn a hanging button! The laundry and pressing were always returned in excellent condition and much earlier than expected. The location of the hotel is brilliant, you can walk to lots of places once you get used to the heat and the humidity which took us polar bears a day or two . The colonial area, the Esplanade, the Merlion, the Raffles etc. are only a short walk away. Singapore is much more greener than expected, my husband saw a big parrot next to the hotel! Taxis are really cheap, don't hesitate to save your feet in the heat. The lowest fare was less than two euros from the hotel to the City Hall MRT (underground) station. There's so much to see in Singapore, our only regret was that we only stayed six days. We'll certainly return to Singapore and the Mandarin Oriental!", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Airdrie, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMy new favorite hotel brand!\u201d", "Author": "nielsensmith", "ReviewID": "UR29102534", "Content": "WOW!

The breakfast buffet at MELT (in the MO) was incredible! They had fresh fruit, homebaked breads and pastries, homemade jams and preserves, all the western buffet classics, Indian choices, and Chinese choices including Dim Sum. It was the best breakfast I've ever eaten, but it wasn't cheap. We had booked a Harbour View Room, and the upgrade cost was well worth it.

I personally am a great fan of the Group and the Brand, and have worked them with them in the past,having been in the hotel industry. However, some disappointment that there was no real recognition of the fact we were returning leisure guests ( come on MO, if Ritz Carlton can do it!!). We were given a harbour view room, when my husband mentioned that we had been automatically upgraded to this on our last stay - but we had to ask. Remembering that a 6 nt stay is quite good for the hotel, particularly in this business environment. It was also my husband's 50th birthday and again no real recognition, evn though I mentioned this on my first reservation request e-mail. Subsequently, I asked what birthday amenites were available - and received a good response. But these things should be picked up by reservations in the initial communication with a Brand of this calibre and not prompted. We were not sure if th hotel is economising in this difficult environment, but the room AC could not be set below 18.5 and the ambient temperature was actually 20 degrees in the room - it was very warm at night and we found ourselves hot and sleeping without covers. We did request to have the AC checked - which it was. Unfortuantley, a maintenance card was left in our room, noting that the room termperature had been reduced to \"VIP Level\"! So, we assume that if you take a suite or the club floor, your room can be set to a cooler temperature! O.k, so internally these\"standards\" can be agreed, but the guest doesn't need to know!! By and large, the staff are still superb and one of the main reasons we come back to the hotel each year. But, we noticed some variation this time, depending on department. Room service were terse and abrupt when I asked if it would be possible to receive 2 glasses of wine in under 45 mins, as we were going out. We were not requesting a full meal! I understand the operational restraints of hotels - but this a 5 star establsishment. That said, most staff are excellent and a huge assett to the hotel. Our last small gripe, relates to breakfast ( not the food, which is amazing). But the hotel clears down exactly at 10.30 am, to set up for lunch ( being a business hotel). It is uncomfortable when your unfinished plates are cleared quickly and when you are aware that people are waiting to do this! Also, being told every morning, for 5 days, at 10.15 am that the breakfast will be finishing at 10.30 am, is just annoying. A discreet sign at the entrance woud be less officious and intrusive. To sum up, even though the rooms and bathrooms are smaller than the RC next door, this is still a classy hotel, with great views, in a fantastic location. There is excellent attention to detail in most areas and it is a haven in the midst of the bustle of S'pore. Being opposite the Esplanade and a pleasant walk to Clarke and Robertson Quay are also big positives. On balance, we would still choose to stay here again, but it would be good to see the service standards being more consistent - as they have been in the past. However, the hotel is almost top of the Trip Advisor list for a reason - and most people will not be disappointed at all with their experience.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cwonderful service!\u201d", "Author": "JudeH", "ReviewID": "UR28761148", "Content": "Just what you would expect from the Mandarin Oriental!

It was brand-new then and its atrium lobby was quite an eye-popper and that, combined with the trademark Mandarin Oriental levels of service and fine food, made it one of the greatest hotels we had ever stayed in. Today, the views from the rooms have become more spectacular with the development of the financial district and the marina, but the hotel is showing its age. That vast lobby now looks very, very dated, with acres of empty gloom, almost like a Soviet-era convention centre. Our premium harbour view room, 1402, was a bit dated and rather small by today\u2019s standards, with a bulky TV set-minibar unit taking up a lot of space, though the newly installed bathroom was excellent and generally speaking this was a pleasant space to occupy. Downstairs, the restaurants are inward-looking, lacking any natural light, though our two meals were truly excellent - an evening buffet offered a wonderful tour of Asian cuisines and the buffet breakfast was world-class. The pool area lacks elegance or shade - something we crave - and the crazy-paving also betrays the hotel\u2019s age. If I ran Mandarin Oriental I\u2019d be looking to build anew here, take their brilliant staff with them, and sell off this brutalist building. On our return visit, in two months\u2019 time, we\u2019ve booked the next door Ritz-Carlton Millennia after inspecting their rooms and their pool area which seem to be a notch up.

It\u2019s beautiful. We were escorted up to our 12th floor room by a very friendly man who demonstrated all the electronic features of the room for us. Our bags were brought up shortly after. The room itself was large and beautifully decorated in modern Asian style. The bathroom was massive and completely clad in marble with a deep bathtub and huge separate shower. The hotel provided every toiletry item you could think of such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, shavers, loofahs, combs etc as well as everything else you would expect from a 5 star hotel. They also provided two pairs of Mandarin Oriental branded slippers and bathrobes which was a nice touch. The large plasma screen built into the wall was fantastic, especially when watching it from the ultra comfortable beds. We even had our own balcony. Everything about the room was stunning. We had breakfast every morning at MELT The World Caf\u00e9 and it was truly fantastic. The staff greeted us politely after seating us, explained all the various and different items we could choose from. The breakfast buffet was made up of at least 5 different stations all with so many different choices of food. They had the typical American breakfast, traditional Asian breakfast, Japanese breakfast, cereal and muesli station, waffle, pancake and muffin station, an area with cakes, doughnuts and Danish pastries and a fruit and juice station with every fruit you could possibly think of. It was really an outstanding experience. The concierge was always very helpful in organising tours or giving us directions. Every time we would return to the hotel after being out we would receive a lovely \u201cwelcome back\u201d and smiles from every member of staff in the lobby.

Our room included a large flat screen television with a wide selection of channels, a large desk, and very comfortable king bed. The bathroom has been totally upgraded as well.

The Balinese staff that run the pool are attentive and service oriented, providing oshibori wet towels, water, and occasional free snacks. We did not experience the food and beverage (except Morton's), preferring the lower prices and tasty fare available a short walk away at the Marina shopping center food centre. Also, the \"gluttons bay\" hawker centre is located just across the street. MOSIN has a branch of the American steakhouse Mortons located in the hotel. Its the best steak restaurant in Singapore (and southeast Asia). For steak lovers its definitely worth a visit, but its also one of the most expensive restaurants in Singapore. Just outside Morton's in a rotunda is a Morton themed martini bar that is one of my favorites. During happy hour free steak sandwiches are served, which are incredibly popular. Our interaction with the staff was no problem. The senior doormen were efficient and friendly in arranging taxi cab and transportation. I noted the room rate has started to ease off after years of inflation.

The second was a quick one night stay. The first stay was excellent, though not without issues. The second stay was not excellent. The problems were always with service. The hotel imagines itself to be five stars, but it is not. The rooms are fine. We saw several. When we first arrived, at 1 am, we were taken to our harbor view room (we had reserved a City View room on recommendation of this site, and in acknowledgment of lower prices and more space). We thought the room small-ish, but settled in for the night, knowing that we would request a change the next day. We did that, showing that we had reserved a larger city room. The staff was accommodating, and moved us, though we then discovered that the air-conditioning in the new room was broken--and needed several hours of repairs. So they moved us again, this time to a nicer City View room, and sent a bottle of wine for our trouble. The Club Lounge was wonderful; the service was fine (except for the \"concierge\" there, who really knew nothing--and ended up referring us to the main hotel concierge). It was not exceptional in any way. In general, this hotel's service was lacking. There were no seats at the pool one day, and the attendants were unwilling to find any. We had to call the manager, who found some after 45 minutes. Service in the main restaurant, at breakfast, was worse: on the one morning we ate there, we were shown to our table. We placed drink orders, and then went to the buffet. When we got back, the table had been given away. They asked us to share it with the people who had taken it. We declined to do so. It took another five minutes to find a new table for us. Service in the Cherry Garden restaurant, and the spa, were both exceptional. So though we were generally pleased with the stay, we had some serious reservations about returning in five days. But we did so, confirming our reservation with the staff when we left, triple checking it with three different people. (And we left a bag as well.) When we came back, five days later, there was no record of the reservation. The hotel staff tried to cover this up, asking for various forms of identification to see if they could find it differing ways. When we confronted them, and produced a photocopy of the reservation, they admitted they had lost it in the five days we were away. I asked for the manager, who eventually made it right--though this took far too much time and caused us a bit of stress, further diminishing our short time in the city. It was, to put it simply, not five star service. We have stayed at the Four Seasons in Singapore, and would stay there again. The rooms at the Mandarin Oriental are the same size, or slightly bigger, but the service at the Four Seasons was, and is, head and shoulders above anything we saw at Mandarin Oriental.

The hotel's exterior is unimpressive and not indicative of the modern interiors and stunning rooms. We were trying to decide between the Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental (incidentally right next to each other with almost a shared courtyard), but chose the MO due to its floor-to-ceiling windows and high reviews. Overall, we were not as satisfied with the property as we'd like for the following reasons: - For the price charged and the kind of brand, service was extremely disappointing to say the least: 1. God help you if you try to order a DVD...according to their in-room directory, you are supposed to call guest services if you would like to order a DVD after 11pm. When I called Guest Services, the lady was first surprised by my request and then transferred me to the concierge desk. No one answered the phone at the concierge desk, so I called guest services back and explained no one was answering the phone. Her response? 'Oh! Let me transfer you again' and before I could say anything, I'd been transferred again. Finally after a good amount of waiting, the concierge deigned to answer the call. When I tried to explain the situation and that I only wanted to rent a DVD, he cut me off in the middle of the explanation and said 'I will have a colleague bring up the list of DVDs to your room'. Of course, the colleague, much less the DVD menu, never showed up. 2. I called Baggage Services to have our luggage picked up before 4pm as we were in a bit of hurry to catch our flight. The attendant asked for number of bags and confirmed someone would be at our door by 3:55. Of course, no one showed up. When I called at about 4:05pm, the attendant had no clue about the request and asked me for number of bags again and said someone would be up immediately...finally showed up at about 4:15pm. - Overpriced: the in-room dining rates are exorbitant for the kind of food. For 2 Penne Arrabiatta and 1 dessert, we were charged SGD 105. Though the pasta was nice, it was not worth the price. Dessert was great though. - Rigid: Breakfast stays open till 10:30, which is fine. If you happen to come at 10:28 like me and try to order omelette at 10:31, too bad. They will no longer serve from the buffet and you will have to order from the a la carte menu. As the staff is extremely busy cleaning up the buffet after the stroke of 10:30, service is extremely slow. At one point, it took the waiter 15 mins to get toast, by which time the rest of my husband's breakfast had gone cold. That said, the room was stunning with floor-to-ceiling window that faced the harbour and the Singapore Eye.

We arrived early in the morning after a very long flight from London expecting to check in straight away as we had paid extra for this, only to be told ourroom was not yet ready. Not a good start. They did provide us with coffee and toast from the breakfast buffet, but we had to sit in a corner almost in the corridor outside the breakfast room and were left to sit there for a couple of hours. Not good when you are exhausted and just want to get some sleep. A receptionist eventually came to find us only to tell us our room had been ready all along. No apology was given though. So we went to check in for the second time, only to find we were only booked in on a room only basis. Again we had paid for bed and breakfast. The receptionist was not pleased when I told her ths and dismissed this in an offhand way, eventually saying they would contact our tour operator. Too tired to follow this up further we went to our room. Our room was lovely. It was spacious and clean and had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and no noise could be heard from adjoining rooms or the corridor. There were several restaurants in the hotel but we only used the breakfat buffet. The other restaurants were expensive although they didi look nice. Singapore is full of excellent places to eat, why limit yourself to a hotel? The breakfast was excellent, with a huge choice. It only ever had about 3 people in it every time we went in. I'm not sure it warranted 4 staff at the door, each saying good morning and walking us to our table. Too much fuss for our liking. The fresh juice section of the buffet was particulalry brilliant with so much choice. The pool was good. The attendants rolled out the towels and brought fresh iced water regularly. We didn't spend much time here though. We had a view of the pool from our room and it never had more than a handful of people sat out there. The concierge seemed too interested in talking to his mate the first time we wanted to talk to him. The second time we tried, we asked about getting booked on the breakfast with the animals at th zoo. We were pleased to get this sorted. When we asked him to book us a taxi, we found we had been booked on an organised coach tour. It was very good, but this was not what we asked the concierge to do for us. Our problem with our booking was still not sorted the day before we were checking out. I had to get in touch with our travel agaent back home before this was acually corrected. The staff in the hotel are overly attentive. We felt uncomfortable with the fact that when you walked in the lobby there were at least 6 staff waiting to say good evening to you. I'm sure some people expect this sort of fawning, but it does nothing for us. 1 person is surely enough. The hotel has some very good points but we were not bowled over by the service we got.

Every culinary delight you could ask for was on offer and the staff were truly attentive and polite. Singapore is a wonderful city and I would highly recommend staying at the Mandarin. However after visiting Raffles I did pine to stay there too. The two hotels couldn't be more different so both have advantages over one another. The Mandarin is ultra modern where as Raffles offers a step back to a bygone era of grace and imperial luxury. Our Suite at the Mandarin was very nice and could not be faulted. Extremely spacious offering a king bed and separate seating area. Modern bathroom and a small balcony. It also benefited from the most spectacular view of the Singapore Skyline. The hotel has many restaurants offering cuisine from all over the world. On our first night we ate at the Cherry Blossom Chinese restaurant which was very nice. We also dined at Morton's which I have to say was very expensive indeed. Two steaks with beers was in excess of $360. Nice steaks, I have to say, but $100 each...not sure. We managed to set aside some time to visit the spa where we enjoyed a couples massage for 90 mins. Absolutely incredible. This was truly the best massage I have ever had! After that we visited the pool where we spent the rest of the afternoon sunbathing. Attentive staff come around with complimentary fruit, granata and sorbet throughout the day to cool off the guests. During our short stay we managed to squeeze in a visit to the night safari, a night time spin on the Singapore Skyline and of course the obligatory Singapore slings at the Long Bar in Raffles.

Singapore is a vibrant electric city but if you look outside the box it is absolutely beautiful. Rich in natural beauty (the lush green surroundings on every road - corner is an absolute treat!), Singapore exceeded expectations for our annual family holiday. We booked seven nights at MO Singapore using MO central reservations. The booking Agent Chris is one of the most helpful people that anyone will ever come across so if you are thinking about going to MO anywhere in the world he should be the man you should book through. We encountered Singapore to be one of the best places that we have ever visited. It is very friendly and everyone at MO Singapore made our welcome extremely comfortable. For that I am very grateful especially to all the staff that served us breakfast. They were so polite (especially to my son - and I cannot thank them enough), that I was astounded by the level of professionalism, and this was to be found throughout the hotel. This is what booking a Five star hotel should be all about, and MO singapore is one of the best. We discovered Singapore by mostly walking it, and this is what anyone should do when they arrive here. The place is simply breathtaking. The shopping of course is an incredible experience but it can be overwhelming at times. Orchard Road is a wonderful experience if at times crazy but then Oxford Street in London is exactly the same thing so go figure. The highlight was popping into Raffles and experiencing a monumental treasure, at which you truly felt history still alive at the place. For us and especially our three year old, Singapore Zoo was the place to be. It was beyond words near enough to being THE jaw dropping experience of all time. It's about 12-15 miles away from the centre of Singapore but it is worth the effort. Consider this. It's Jurassic Park but with animals not dinosaurs and you should have an idea of the picture I'm trying to paint. We loved it and it should be the number one destination especially if you are a family reading this. The Zoo in my opinion beats Sentosa Island, simply because the Island is going through a lot of work. This isn't a bad thing because it will soon be a world class resort incorporating Universal studios. However be warned. Although you can have a two for one ticket to see the pink dolphins show and the sea life centre, the latter is a big let down for the price they charge. It's in and out at the sea life centre and it leaves you wanting more. So Singapore if you are reading this make a bigger sea life centre! Right next to Sentosa Island is Vivo shopping centre which we found to be extremely useful and the views from the top are incredible, and next door to that you have the ferry terminal just incase you fancy a hop on to somewhere else! In all if you are thinking to Singapore or not to Singapore, then do not hesitate. The other thing we realized was that Malaysia isn't so far away from Singapore, so if you want to go on a adventure there is nothing to stop you - that is if you have the time to do so. The last point I would like to make is this. When we booked our room we were told that we could have a child bed at no extra cost. However at arrival we were told that we would have to pay extra for a room to accommodate the bed. We of course declined and took it up with the management, who were very helpful and apologetic. Although at first we were disappointed at this hiccup, the management of the hotel including the manager himself wrote back to assure us that this will never happen again. I would like to add that even when something went wrong and not to our satisfaction, everyone at MO singapore were extremely helpful. We look forward to visiting MO and Singapore once again, and on a parting note I would like to thank the staff at MO and the manager for being incredibly courteous once more because they deserve it.

Staying in a club room we had been to the club lounge each day for breakfast and although there was a sign at the entrance mentioning the dresscode (no shorts and no open-toed sandals) this was widely ignored by the guests and on the 3rd day my wife walked in in flip-flops and was stopped at the entrance being advised she could not enter in those flip-flops. Pointing our that from the entrance she could see 2 other ladies in similar flip-flops, she was advised that the other ladies were wearing flip-flops not made from rubber.... My wife went to the room to change and the following day the club lounge manager stopped me in my tracks asking if my wife was upset over the incidence? Why the club lounge manager did not ask my wife I don't know, but I said that my wife was of course upset at having been discriminated at. Then it all fell apart for the club lounge manager... She said that they had approached the other ladies in the club lounge after turning my wife away and asked them to change shoes as my wife had pointed out they were not following the dress code. Some lame excuses followed and the manager asked me if things were now in order since they had ensured no one showed up in flip-flops. I was flabbergasted!!! I tried to explain the manager that we had nothing against the other guests wearing flip-flops but we had something against the hotel choosing to apply its policies at the entrance to some people and not to others. As we stood in the entrance to the club lounge talking about this, 2 ladies by the way walked in in flip-flops and were not stopped. The club lounge manager had no clue what I was referring to - and that is the exact reason I will never stay at a mandarin oriental hotel again.", "Date": "September 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cQuite simply, stunning!\u201d", "Author": "OldVillain", "ReviewID": "UR19824852", "Content": "The experience begins as you step from the taxi.

Definitely the floor to be on because that is where the Club Lounge is sited; just a short walk away from 1906, the room that I was given. This is a good room to go for (or 1901~1905) because you can pick-up the Club Lounge\u2019s free Wireless Broadband, instead of using the in-room cabled service. It also saves you carrying your laptop into the Club Lounge. The rooms are beautifully appointed. All that you require is there for you in the various draws and cupboards to be discovered. Molton Brown shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body moisturiser are also available in Club rooms. It\u2019s great to shower with these products in the morning and leaves you feeling pampered. You have a nice desk and chair (a mini office) to work from and a fabulous view over the marina and towards the Central Business District. Breakfast is served in the Club Lounge on the 19th floor from 06:30 until 10:30 (you can use the \u2018Melt\u2019 Restaurant on the 4th floor if you prefer but quite frankly I wouldn\u2019t bother). Here on the 19th, you are treated as an individual by the immaculately dressed and professional staff. After breakfast is over you have morning coffee. Later, a light lunch-time snack is served buffet style. In the afternoon, you have Tea (scones, clotted cream and jam, amongst the other delights). Then comes the cocktail hour (two hours actually, from 17:30 until 19:30). Followed by snacks and drinks throughout the evening until the Lounge closes at 23:00. Morton\u2019s Chicago Steakhouse is sited on the 4th floor and if you love a delicious steak, this is the place to go. There are other restaurants available, including a Japanese restaurant. Whether staying on business, like I did, or travelling as part of your vacation, this is one of \u2018the\u2019 places to stay in Singapore.

My room was a Junior Seaview suite. My feelings with regard to this place is mixed. The location is \"alright\" but not really within walking distance to the cool shopping areas, and the coastal view is a bit gloomy. Its not really something for a holiday sort of stay. For business use, it was excellent location wise - very close to the financial district, yet still luxurious. Fairly quiet \"corner\" of the city. Optically, the building is pretty hideous (as is much of Singapore from this time period). Inside its obvious that it has been upgraded (a lot) inside - recently. The lobby, elevators and restaurants were definatly of 5 star grade. The front desk service and lobby staff, also. (classic asian style service, tons and tons of employees). The rooms themselves were not really to my liking. I mean, lets keep it real here - the room price of a suite - is under 500 euro - so compared to europe or attractive parts of the US, it's not exactly expensive. But... The bathrooms had dated style marble - which was not very nice, the ligthing was generally poor (which is never a good sign), the windows / sliding doors were of original vintage, which detracted from the luxury feel. The AC was sort of weird, if you put it on 20c, it was meatlocker cold, anything above 20c (incl. 20.5) equaled 35c++ and very high humidity. Weird. The carpet was nice, but never \"felt\" clean. The amenities were plentiful. The minibar and TV was very 1990's. Generally the room just didn't feel \"crisp\" in any way. Scrapes and stuff all over the place. The closets stank like they had been closed for 15 years. Also, the shower had nice long black hairs in it, not so nice. ;( Cleaning (besides from the hairs) was mediocre. So... I guess... Not horrible, not great. Personally, I wouldnt go there again. Oh, the Mortons steakhouse at the hotel was as good as the ones in the states.

Upon booking we had mentioned that we were traveling for our anniversary, so the hotel saw fit to put us up in a fantastic room.

The bed was one of the most comfortable ones I have ever had the pleasure to sleep in, with a choice of pillows that satisfied even a fussy sleeper like myself. I feel that one of the hallmarks of truly great hotels is invisible service, and staff that can truly anticipate your needs.

The concierge was extremely helpful, and was able to provide suggestions that covered everything from entertainment to dining and shopping. The service throughout was simply outstanding - genuinely hospitable, knowledgeable, and efficient. The hotel is located a little bit on the periphery of the more happening spots, but taxis are fairly cheap, and are a widely used means of transportation. The MRT is also extremely efficient, but you will have to walk a bit to the nearest station, and Singapore is not very pedestrian friendly in all areas.

As it was a busy weekend on Aug 2-3rd, the hotel was certainly put to the test in service standards. I was pretty perturbed when I reached the hotel for a check-in at 3pm and realised that my room was still not ready for occupation. I was told to wait for 1.5hrs. I was merely told I was to be allocated a higher floor than I had originally booked but not given any form of compensation while I waited. The front desk could have given me a welcome drink and told me to take a rest in the club lounge while I waited. Does that mean I had to wait and check time and again till I was eventually allocated a room? No answers were given. Was this the kind of service standards I had expected from a top ranking tripadvisor hotel? What's more, such service standards strayed from the usual standards I would expect from a MO hotel ! I began to wonder if It was because I was a local resident and not an international guest and therefore not given priority in room allocation. I know that front desk was under a lot of pressure but my point was that they could have been better prepared to deal with such a tight and pressing condition. I had no choice but to store my luggage with concierge and go ahead for a swim at the pool while I waited. Along the way, I was put through some inconvenience as I was still afterall a hotel guest, with no room but using hotel facilities. I waited patiently till half past five and still there was no news from front desk. I decided to go downstairs to front desk and after much difficuly, they finally found me a room. My question is - If I did not go downstairs at 6pm to enquire, would it mean that I was simply forgotten and had to wait till 7pm to get my room when I should have been given at 3pm? That would mean that I would have to miss half the show at the Marina bayfront where the preview was happning - the only reason why I chose to check in at the MO as it was directly facing the bayfront. I even had to remind the front desk there was a need for some form of compensation for the time lost. I was rather shocked such reminders had to be given after reading reviews about the excellent service standards at MO Singapore ! Are local guests not guests of the hotel at all? I was only able to speak to the Duty Manager subsequently who proceeded to apologise and compensate me for my time lost. The next day, I also received a personal apology note and a box of chocolates.Perhaps this was only an isolated event about their lack in service standards. The duty manager had superbly demonstrated the service standards of a top ranking hotel, so did the pool staff who remembered guests by name ( not all staff could do that ! ) as well as the some of frontline staff I met along the way. What I liked about the MO as compared to other hotels in Singapore is this - the huge buffet spread at MELT, the poolstaff who bend over backwards to provide excellent service and the awesome view of the harbour view rooms. Things to improve - service standards of front desk ,TV in rooms ( do consider changing to plasma or flat screen which the rest of the world is using ) and pl. treat all guests the same way, be it local or international.

They need to update the bathrooms. - Laundry is definitely tailored for the expense account set. This means that you could be out USD 300 for doing a family's worth of clothes. The MO should come up with some reasonable family plan for this. It is painful and annoying. Overall we loved the place and will certainly stay again.

As a small feature, the hotel directory in our room was new and clean and not browsed by a hundred previous guests, as is often the case in other hotels. We had an uninterrupted view of the marina. However, as other trip advisors have noted, there is much construction work on two sides of the marina in this area of Singapore, and a floating stage is now positioned on the water, directly opposite the hotel. This detracts from the view, but there was no external noise. We arrived late, so chose to eat in our room. The room service menu was extensive, although expensive, but the food was very good. Breakfast at the Mandarin Oriental is as good as it gets, and is an experience in itself. Don't even think of having breakfast in your room.

That sums up my experience at the Oriental. ***Before the Trip*** Prior to the trip, my fiance and I discussed booking with Raffles, but decided to save the extra bucks and stay with Oriental instead (at the end of the day, the money saved was only minuscule!). Not to say that the Oriental is anything to sneeze at - there were definitely some amazing features this Oriental had, but after staying the one in Bangkok and seeing what we could have had at Raffles, this was just another great experience at a luxury hotel but nothing spectacular. Right before we left for Singapore, we ordered a limo to pick us up at the airport. During the call, they offered us an upgrade to a club level room for not much so we said \"Why not? Let's do it!\" ***Arrival*** The chauffeur was already there when we arrived, helped us with our luggage and was VERY patient with us as my fiance rushed off to exchange currency. He was pleasant and we drove away in style in a gorgeous black Mercedes. Inside, he already had cold waters waiting for us - very thoughtful! The check-in process was a breeze and he took us up to our room. ***The Room*** The room was nice (#2136). It was chic and mostly modern with an Asian flair and lit beautifully with recessed lighting. Since it was a club room, we were on the 21st floor, but the view was industrial!! Muddy waters, a highway, industrial boats and construction below of some mall they were building - yuk. Disappointed. (Sidenote: I took this trip in Dec 2006 but I see from a recent review that they were still building the darn thing?) The bathroom was mediocre. The marble shower was nice, although I've seen better. The bathroom had that window blind thing again where you can actually look into the bathroom - annoying. And if you look through that window, the end of the bathroom from that angle is the toilet with no door. If you were laying on the bed facing the bathroom, you can actually see whomever stand up in front of the toilet doing their business - get my gist? It was a little too \"close\" for our comfort. Other than the view and the bathroom thing, the room was decent and furnished nicely, down to the fruit basket and bottle of wine. Woohoo! ***Club Benefits*** The club room was located on the 19th floor. They had some tasty yummies there and it was just so relaxing to sip some champagne with your honey by the window. It was quiet too - very nice. ***Limo Service*** This was the best part of the trip! We paid a bargain of about $50/hour to have a chauffeur drive us around Singapore. Great deal, considering the size of the island. I think we got away with paying about $300 total. :) Our chauffeur was AWESOME. He took us around all the sites and even helped us take pictures! When it rained and we were out of the car, he made sure he had an umbrella over us. He made sure we weren't hungry and when we were he took us to the most AMAZING noodleshop with delicious local flavors. The owner is supposed to be famous for how he makes the noodles - he even did a show for us! We felt very special in the restaurant. When we asked for a custom suit, the chauffeur took us to a fabulous shop and even had it shipped to us in the States for a discount off the price. Sweet! Our chauffeur also took us to Raffles to look around - that's when our hearts sank. Raffles was MUCH more gorgeous than the Oriental. The extra money we spent on the club room could have gotten a regular room at Raffles but - sigh - next time, right? There were so much more good stuff with the chauffeur but I won't tell it all here - this should give you the gist of how awesome their limo service is. ***Overall*** This is where I learned my lesson on how it usually pays off to pay just a little more for the hotel you really want. It was a good trip and the hotel was still nice (less the construction and window into the toilet thing), but our good time was mainly thanks to the limo driver. I probably wouldn't stay here again. P.S. The Oriental is adjacent to a mall - nice if you're bored but it wasn't anything to write home about.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cReal Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "PhileasFoggontour", "ReviewID": "UR17655193", "Content": "I've stayed at most of the big hotels in Singapore, and the reality is that there's a lot of positives about all of them.

My trip includes some other fine stops; the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore and then the Park Hyatt in Saigon. However, my expectation was that my stay at the Oriental was going to be the best of them all (and the other two were very good indeed). The stay was good, but it didn't reach the level that I was anticipating. Generally the hotel is superb, but there were some items and some issues that grated. One was relating to an airport pick up car that Amex had cancelled well in advance, that had turned up and been charged to my room and stayed there even at check-out. (I promise you Changi airport is the one airport in the world that doesn't need an airport limo pick up. The worst experience on your way into town will be the ever increasing Singapore traffic.) I got an online survey from the hotel after I had left and I took care to provide some feedback that I was less than overwhelmed with my stay. As I've said not a disaster, just some issues. I might even have said that I preferred the Ritz Carlton. I then got a message from the hotel asking if I'd be willing to discuss my feedback. So, in what would have been late at night in Singapore (I'm in New York) the most charming lady (Michelle) called me from the hotel and listened to my feedback, and issues and the charge that I'd never managed to remove. She even listened to my gripes about the cost of room service, and that the door man didn't know where the Ford Factory Museum was (not many people do, it's about the Japanese occupation of Singapore and well worth a visit for history buffs) And she said the right things, and had the charge fixed the very next day. Finally I got a pleasant follow up note from the Duty Manager (Mandy). So, I have to admit that the service in the end did win me over and I'll be happy to stay there again. My only word of warning about the hotel - and others nearby - is that there is a lot of construction in the area.

We also had the advantage of having a terrace and not being on the noisy side of the hotel so we stuck with that room. I enquired about access to the Club but for the price we decided we would rather go 'a la carte'.

The room was well presented and modern and comfortable. We had a City View and it was quiet! However, the bathroom was very small no bath just large walk in shower. The only other problem encountered was with the actual structure of the Hotel. With a central atrium from floor to ceiling and being on the top floors my husband suffered from vertigo. All the six glass open lifts went directly from the centre of the atrium. Quite spectacular if you can stand heights and a number of people found this a problem.

Is it my imagination or does the volume decrease as they get older - the young ones seem to be trying so hard to impress. You can immediately recognize the ones who are already successful, they don't yell, if they use their phones at all. Later in the day the lounge is pleasant for a cold drink and a snack. We dined at the the Italian restaurant by the very attractive pool area and the food was quite good with attentive service. All in all this a well-run hotel with much to recommend it. Now the negative. The marina area is undergoing a lot of construction including a monumental casino across the channel from the Oriental. The construction and traffic noise is just plain loud. There was a pile driver going while we were there that didn't stop until 10pm.

Had a Club City Room, slightly larger than the Sea and Marina view rooms as I recall but not by much - a very good size. On every level I found it impossible to fault the hotel - staff were incredibly attentive and polite but never overbearing or appearing to be 'sucking up' or giving the impression you are a king. They just come across as genuinely happy to be at work and pleased to see you, like friends. We just felt totally at home throughout. I would almost everyone take a Club floor room. The Club offers excellent value for money and you can, if you wish, eat three meals a day up there (inclusive) incl. champagne breakfast and cocktails at tea. The Club staff are amazing and the whole Club experience made our stay extra special, providing the perfect place to relax and meet friends and family before venturing out. Choice of restaurants on site is exceptional and Melt totally changed out attitude to buffet. The quality of food was incredible so much so that after our first lunch visit we decided to have Christmas Dinner there too. Every festive food imaginable available including Lobster, monkish, sushi, roast turkey, brussel sprouts(!) indian, thai, chinese and, especially for the Antipodeans, an a open charcoal barbecue outside with a huge selection of meat and fish cooked on demand plus a whole lamb. it's not just quality though - nothing is on massive platters, just smaller plates, expertly prepared and replenished as required. Which made it easier to take small bites and enjoy a little of everything rather than stuff yourself on the first course. My mouth waters just thinking about it........ oh to be back there! Mortons Steakhouse on site is like being in the US - I've spent plenty of time in the US and it was like being teleported back there. Food, portions, service, style..... an incredible feat of theming and a fantastic meal. Then to working off the marvellous food......the gym is newly equipped and the well trained staff were, again, well beyond expectaions. The outside pool area was relaxing with great service from the staff. Concierge was spot on too - a little something I noticed was that the hotel staff gave all the taxi drivers a gift. Might have been Christmas or to highlight that it is now branded Mandarin Oriental and not just The Oriental. Which incidentally was the only problem, if any, during our stay. Despite the age of the hotel and its appearance in so many photos I could not believe the lengths we had to go to in explaining what hotel we were going to and where it was. Grasping Singlish helps but even then we needed to list every other hotel in the vicinity before drivers worked out where to go. But I think the gifts were a means to deal with this - a great idea.

If possible the dinner buffet is even better - do NOT bother eating outside - we tried it one night and regretted it. The starters include huge prawns, oysters, crab and every kiond of meat and sushi as well as super fresh salad. Main courses are again set out on counters by nationality - the indian dishes are to die for or you can have your personally chosen ingredients stir fried with the most wonderful stock, or chinese or japanese as well as good all western joints, chicken etc. But the thing that puts this hotel above all others is the service. from the minute you walk through the door a myriad os staff are ALWAYS on hand to answer your every need - in fact they often ask to help even when you dont need anything. changing the duvet from my bed (too hot) into a sheet and blanket setup was done rapidly and without any reluctance. i was always greeted at the restaurant by name (how do they do that?) and escorted politely to a table. the bellboy even raced me to the lift to press the button. even the reception staff approached you with a smile as you neared rather than the usual frosty attitude as you try to get their attention. the pool attendant stopped what he was doing immediately to ask if i needed any help as i appeared in the pool area. i felt cosseted, cared for and cared about. i cannot praise this hotel enough. in singapore do not stay anywhere else.", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c5 Stars and Better\u201d", "Author": "ShaunScotland", "ReviewID": "UR13342966", "Content": "Still one of the best hotels in the world.

I queried why the other couple had been given a room and he said that the couple had paid extra (I checked this out with then later and this was not true).

We found the experience to be one of sheer luxury. I would urge anyone contemplating a stay in Singapore to seriously consider this option out of the many, many available to choose from. In terms of value for money ...it was a hit. We booked early and directly with the hotel and secured a great rate of around $300 AUD per night for 2 adults and 1 child with breakfast included. Fantastic, given the excellent standard and quality of the hotel. As a bonus, the roll out bed was free of extra charge; a rarity for the other Singapore hotels that I had checked out. My husband has worked in a global role out of London but based in Sydney for the last 10 years. As a consequence of this, he has spent much of that time travelling the world. I have been very fortunate to be able to join him on many trips and have experienced many 5 ~ 6 star hotels. I would have to say that the Mandarin Oriental ranks most highly. We found the attention to detail across all aspects of service provision to be excellent. The most notable point was the friendly and courteous attitude of all staff; from the staff who handled my initial e-mail enquiries to the Concierge and dining staff and right down to the pool and gym staff. They all expressed good cheer and humour and genuinely appeared to love their work and to be committed to making the hotel function at optimum performance. We were also greatly impressed by the size of our room (we were upgraded to a Junior Suite), the quality of inclusions and the care taken to clean the room, attend to 'turn down' of an evening and to replenish bathroom items. The latter point may seem a minor one but, can lead to irritation if unattended! Similarly we were very impressed with fit out of the gym, the hotel landscaping, the pool and its surroundings. I walked over to check out the Fullerton which, in my opinion, pales in comparison to this hotel. In terms of children, this would definitely be your choice of hotel in Singapore as: the pool was huge and surrounding area was great, you are away from the intense hustle of Orchard Rd, there are great cheap-eating Hawker food markets across the road and beautiful, riverside plu other walks in all directions from the hotel. There is a greater sense of space in and around this hotel compared the Fullerton and Orchard Rd hotels that would appeal to anyone with kids. Anyway, taxis are so cheap that all venues are easily and cheaply accessible. I have already recommended your hotel to my friends who travel and our friends based in Singapore who we were visiting.

The pool area is a good size, very clean and great service from the pool staff, who provided bottles of water, sorbet and fresh fruit. The location of the hotel isn't central but opposite the Esplanade and right next to Marina Square shopping centre so plenty of places to eat and drink nearby. However it only cost around \u00a31 for a taxi to Clarke Quay and about \u00a32 to Orchard Rd. We did walk to Clarke Quay which only took around 15 minutes!

Whilst for business guests I guess this is not so much of a problem, but for tourists who have a few days, I would not recommend this place so much unless they got to grips pretty quickly with the transport options. Hotel itself, cannot fault. We didn't get any Molton Brown toiletries that I read of in one review - maybe this is just for Club guests? Incidentally the hotel tried very hard to flog this option to us - it just didn't seem to make economic sense. The breakfast was wonderful but we found the restaurant prices obscenely expensive. Made the mistake of eating at Mortons one night (we'd left it very late to eat, our feet hurt too much to go out and it was the only place that would take us at 1030pm at night in the hotel) and I was shocked by the rip-off prices. S$ 20 for a Martini, when you can get a fabulous one with views to boot at New Asia Bar at the Swisshotel for S$12? S$35 for one tiny crab cake? I refused on principle to order a main course as I felt that to charge those sort of prices for something that would cost a quarter of the price outside was taking the michael. Service was annoyingly American, with waiters wanting to 'present' the menu to us instead of just letting us read the menu! Next thing they will be giving a slideshow. Plus they never let us alone for a minute. Not the place for a romantic dinner. The concierge was not well informed on bus routes - I guess he is more used to helping business guests and hailing cabs. We wanted a bus to the Orchid Gardens and was told that there was only 1 bus that didn't quite go as far - not true. Luckily the bus driver helped out and put us right. There's a bus that takes you right there BTW. This leads me to the location. Not great for tourists. Whilst you can walk, in the sapping heat that's not always an option. City Hall MTR is about 10 mins away and not much use if you want to go to Chinatown or the Quays as this involves a nightmare change at Doby Ghaut. My recommendation is to go across the road and get a bus from Esplanade Mall. The bus maps are easy to work out, they are cheap, and air conditioned! First 2 days we used taxi, then graduated to MTR, but finally worked out the buses were the best way to go. There are loads of buses that go direct to Orchard Road. Next time we visit Singapore, we'd choose the Fullerton. Great hotel in a very central location. Don't bother going to Raffles for the Singapore Sling - what a disappointment and waste of money! DO visit the Swisshotel on Stamford Road and head to New Asia Bar for great cocktails at sunset. We enjoyed Clarke Quay area very much at night, and had the most wonderful brunch at Marmalade Pantry in the Palace Renaissance mall on Orchard Road. Shops don't open until around 1030/11am, so it's great to go there for a late breakfast before the shops open.", "Date": "November 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "birmingham", "Title": "\u201cnice but too formal\u201d", "Author": "rachaelmakeup", "ReviewID": "UR10647591", "Content": "I honeymooned here andloved the Spa.

I am referring to the new revamped The Mandarin Oriental Singapore, formerly known as The Oriental. I used to be a member of the gym at the hotel many years ago and I had stayed in their rooms during those period. I would not wax lyrical about my experiences then.The hotel was part of the Marina Square development near the city centre and was part of a trio of hotels, namely, Marina Mandarin, Pan Pacific and The Oriental. The Oriental as it then was had always been the best of the three though. Its neighbour, The Ritz Carlton Millenia, came into the scene as the first 6star hotel In Singapore and had always somewhat overshadowed The Oriental. However, since this hotel became part of the Mandarin Oriental fold, it has metamorphosed into the most luxurious hotel in town. I have stayed in the hotel twice, once over the August 2007 National Day holiday and the other last weekend. My first stay was in a huge corner suite with a south view and that of its neighbour, The Ritz Carlton. The second stay was in a normal deluxe room with a West facing view of the city skyline. On both occasions, I had access to the Club Lounge, which is the reason why a stay in this hotel is very highly recommended. The Club Lounge is the most luxurious facility of its kind in any hotel in Singapore. I have been to a few of these in other hotels but the one in Mandarin Oriental is by far the most luxurious, beautiful and inviting. The d\u00e9cor is something out of Elle D\u00e9cor Magazine with 2 types of seating, plush sofas or small dining tables. The walls are clad in pleasing exotic dark wood veneer and tribal artifacts tastefully adorn the lounge area. The Club Lounge is bathed in natural light which comes in from a high floor to ceiling window panels. There is a library near the reception area but coffee table books are placed everywhere for your reading pleasure. If you have access to the lounge during your stay, this is where you can have breakfast away from the madding crowd, indulge in high tea or enjoy evening cocktails. Between 5.30pm to 7.30pm, that is the best time to hang out at the Club Lounge. That is when they serve gourmet food! Last weekend, they had North Indian food on one evening and French on the other (foie gras maison and slices of magret de canard a l\u2019orange anyone?). During my previous stay, the food was Thai. The food is simply delicious and enough for you to skip dinner altogether. But that means forgoing a delightful selection of superb restaurants in the hotel, including Mortons for exceptional steak. If you don\u2019t have access to the Club Lounge, there is a coffee lounge on the 4th floor with a harbour view and plush setting. And if you don\u2019t eat out, order room service. Even its room service food is top notched and the food comes with such beautiful presentation. My order of seafood chowder was absolutely delicious and came chock a block with a treasure trove of shrimps, mussels and scallop. My order of Tom Yam Goong was served in a petite young coconut. In other words, this hotel has the Mandarin Oriental quality stamp all over. This also applies to the service for which Mandarin Oriental is famous for. From the bellboys, to the reception and down to the chambermaids, everyone greets you with a smile. As you check in, a personel will escort you to your room or to the Club Lounge. The service is both assured and confident. You cannot say the same about this in many other establishments on the island. The rooms are very tastefully done with a lot of wood and marble in the d\u00e9cor. The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom adequately spacious with a separate bathtub and shower areas. The toiletries from Molton Brown are quite exotic and very refreshing. Whilst the rooms are not equipped with a plasma TV, the touch screen universal remote for the TV makes navigation for in-room entertainment a breeze. I recommend a room with the harbour/city skyline view. It will take your breath away despite the sight of towering cranes all over the construction site for the integrated resort. The sunset and water view is worth the extra penny. They also pamper you with a generous fruit bowl, a delicious cheese platter plus a bottle of wine. I did not try the spa, so I cannot comment on that. The fitness centre has been upgraded and is now 10 times better than what it used to be. The fitness centre is no longer open to public membership which explains its quality. The hotel pool is definitely one of the best here as it offers you a good depth and length enough for you to do short laps. If you are an Amex Centurion Card holder like me, you have extended check out until 6pm, which gives you all the extra time to indulge in the luxury that this superb property has to offer. I would recommend this hotel highly for a superb weekend getaway even to Singaporeans. My experience here is 10 times better than that in Mandarin Oriental Kuala Lumpur (see separate review).", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exmouth, W.A.", "Title": "\u201cMade our honeymoon even MORE memorable!\u201d", "Author": "Liriel", "ReviewID": "UR10587213", "Content": "I can not say enough complimentary things about this hotel!

It felt like I couldn't turn a corner without someone there to open a door for me and it made me feel more like I was constantly being watched. But the shop assistants do that as well in Malaysia/Singapore so I think it is just their way. Other complaints were the price of everything - use of internet in the business centre was hideously expensive (there is a very cheap internet cafe up the road) - and also having only duvets on the beds in a city that is constantly hot and humid meant for a couple of very warm nights.

I've stayed here before some 6 years back and been to the Shangri-La, Fullerton, Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton. I was curious about the heavy advertising on the \"renamed, rejuvenated\" spiel for this branch of the Mandarin Oriental chain and opted to stay here. I got a harbourview room. Incentives: 1) There has indeed been a marked improvement in the hotel since several years ago. I was honestly impressed with the change. The hotel looks refreshed and even though the building itself isn't that new, the hotel and its facilities/furnishings have all been upgraded and/or well-maintained. 2) With the new casino coming up and move of the business/downtown area to the bay area, The MOSG is in an excellent location for business in the future along with already lovely views pegged to improve as 2010 looms. 3) It is next to a major mall with food and shops readily available though it is not directly connected to it like the Pan Pacific. This means having to walk outdoors and risking some rain frequently but I personally didn't find the 2 minute journey that much of a hassle. The local theatre and concert hall is right across the street for those with artistic intents. 4) The service is truly top-notch and in this reviewer's opinion, now the best in town. The staff were all sincerely friendly and smiling with greetings that didn't sound too artificial or over the top like in some places. They opened lift doors and the doormen were always ready to assist. Memorably, housekeeping polished 2 pairs of shoes for me and even declined a tip saying it was a pleasure to be of service and he enjoyed polishing really good quality shoes! In all my years of travel, I've never encountered such a thing and am truly impressed. This attention to personal detail and individual touches by the staff helps make one feel special and at home and differentiates the truly international world-class from mere 5 stars. They have clearly exceeded anything Fullerton, Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons have provided in the service department. Only the Shangri-La compares but the Shang's location isn't as convenient for future business come 2010 and truth be told, it is also getting a little long in the tooth. 5) They have a great collection of restaurants and breakfast was excellent. Morton's, the chinese restaurant and the cafe were all consistently good places. This is useful for business trips since meal meetings can be right at the hotel without sacrificing food quality. Discentives: 1) The only blimp on service was that I checked in with a request for a non-smoking harbourview room , which was accepted when I made a booking, only to be sent to a smoking one. When I called front desk, the person on actually told me they didn't have anymore non-smoking rooms. This is clearly wrong and my booking shouldn't have been accepted to begin with or I should have been told at the front desk rather than after I came up to the room. To the hotel's credit, the front desk manager immediately took charge when I expressed unhappiness and moved me into a better non-smoking room with a better view and sent up bellhops to move my luggage. These personnel also declined any further tip as part of the apology for the error. She also called to personally apologise for the mistake. 2) The rooms are functional at best with little character or space. However, closet and storage space is quite excellent. One can argue that prices for rooms in Singapore are very reasonable next to Hongkong or even Bangkok for the upper end but a little more space would be nice. The next door Ritz-Carlton fairs better in this department. The lack of character and amenities seems to be a Singapore hotel thing in general. Even the lauded Fullerton's Philippe Starck room furnishings were somewhat perfunctory overall in design when put together though each individual piece was often quite avant garde. The special extras found in MO NYC and HK were all missing like decked out multi-fax phones and flat screen TVs in the bathrooms. 3) The hotel rooms still use cathode-ray tube TVs. This is already quite unacceptable for 5 star world city standards. However, the facility to iPod link to the the room sound system is pretty good. 4) The need to exit the hotel in the open to get to the nearby mall has already been mentioned. 5) No underground mass transit service is nearby and public transport ex-taxis are not a feature of this hotel or the nearby Ritz-Carlton. 6) For a revamp, it is disconcerting to see they still use the old name \"The Oriental\" on the clothes hangers, writing instruments and toiletries while the mineral water and paper etc. trumpet \"Mandarin Oriental\". This is somewhat inconsistent, though to be fair a more minor point. Taken in total, the MOSG has indeed impressed me and seems to be a true member of the aggressively expanding MO chain. While minor points remain that peg it lower than its compatriots in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Bangkok, this is true of all Singapore hotels in general. When in Singapore, weighing all the hotel options, I would definitely opt to stay at the MOSG again. It is my pick for a Singapore hotel.

The hotel is located an easy 10 minute walk to the City Hall subway station, and it is possible to do almost the whole walk indoors through various malls if Singapore is having one of its torrential downpours.. Getting cabs was super convenient, and the workers hailing the cabs were so nice and actually funny! The Club perks were worth every penny- free internet in the lounge, extra help with concierge services, champagne breakfast, non-alc drinks all day, and evening cocktail and hors d'oeuvre hour. The breakfast was a nice blend of waitress service and buffet. I loved having a mimosa in the morning! The best thing was that the cocktail hour food was amazing and changed significantly each day. At both main services they had a wonderful selection of very fine cheeses. The afternoon tea had a nice array of nibbles, too. They seemed to be a bit slow in the service in the lounge, but most of the time i think it was cultural and not wanting to intrude or to seem pushy... I loved the amenities in the room especially the nice sound system and the soothing Chinese Tea when we arrived. The bathroom was beautiful, though I do wish the tub and the shower had been a bit bigger. Each were fine only for one person really. As far as some of the otehr aspects of the hotel: We had a couple's massage in the spa's couple's suite and the service there was impeccable. The massage was one of the best each of us has had. The food from room service was surprisingly good, as was the food at Melt. We didn't try the other restaurants though we heard good things about the Japanese restaurant and the Mediterranean restaurant from friends staying at the same time as us. I sat out by the pool, but I didn't get in because the one day i had time I felt it was too cool to get wet and there is no hot tub.

Cold cuts, cheeses etc for Europeans, Japanese and Chinese breakfasts, breads, fruits and a selection of hot food off a menu. The Lounge also does complimentary appetizers and drinks from 5:30 to 7:30 pm If you stay in the Club room two nights or more you get a complimentary transfer one way to or from the airport - your choice. Airport: 20 min away by taxi. Taxis are very inexpensive here in Singapore compared to other main centers. Taxi fare was $16 from the airport. Customs was a breeze - Heathrow take note! Luggage was very prompt. 40 min from time of landing to hotel. There are also airport shuttle buses to the various hotels for about $7. Not quite as fancy as the Manderin in HK but the room rate was less too so it balances out Check In: - if staying in a club room they take you up to the room and check you in there. Very efficient. Staff: Excellent all around. Service is wonderful. Any queries were done quickly and efficiently. Everyone is personable. Hard to get through the lobby without a couple of offers to carry my briefcase for me. Room Service: Prompt - before promised time. Food was good. Selection of vegetarian items too. Fitness: They have a fitness room with several treadmills, bicycles, elipticals. Also some free weghts, a few machines: legs, chest and shoulders. Pool: Outdoors and big enough for laps. Spa: I didn't use but they have a nice selection of services at reasonable rates. Menu in the room. Internet: Cost approx $20 USD per day for wireless in room. Free wireless in club lounge. Good connection. Have a business package - stapler, tape, etc in each room. Room: Lots of closet, storage space, iron and ironing board in room (hooray - rare in Asia). DVD / CD Player. Bedside clock with alarm. Fresh fruit every day. No noise issues. Bathroom: Nice - separate shower and tub, marble. Good vanity lighting. Spacious. Only minor complaint is that the tub is not long enough for me to extend my legs in (I'm 5'10\"). 2 terry cloth robes. Security: Have to put your room card in the elevator before you can push the floor #. In room safe where you program your own code. Great area. Attractions: right across the street from the Esplanade Mall. Close to the Boat Quay for al fresco dining. Distances may be farther than you think. From Raffles 5 to Raffles 1 is a 15 min walk.

We chose The Oriental because of its location - right next to the main shopping malls, and an easy walk to Raffles. We even walked back to the hotel from Chinatown after being dropped off there at the end of the city tour. It took about half an hour and was not unpleasant, as Singapore has lots of trees lining the streets to keep the sun off you. The best rooms are on floors 18-21. We had a harbour view and were lucky enough to see the rehearsals for the National Day Parade which was, for the first time, to take place on a specially built floating platform in the harbour. From our high vantage point we had a spectacular view of formations, fireworks, Chinook helicopters flying low to simulate an air-sea rescue, and a fly-past. If this was a rehearsal I envy anyone who gets to see the real thing! We found very few eateries open before 11am, especially ones that served what most would consider a breakfast, so you should seriously consider taking breakfast at the hotel. For other meals you'll have no problem finding plenty of variety at very reasonable cost. Taxis are cheap, too, and tipping is not expected, or indeed encouraged. It's said that you absolutely must have a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar at Raffles, and throw peanut shells on the floor. Well, if you must you must, and you really must.

I loved every aspect of The Oriental Singapore, although this is one of those \"less luxurious\" properties in the Mandarin Oriental Chain, but it is the service here that shines out and is one of the most important factor in making me want to go back here. On arrival, there are plenty of doormen and bellboys at the door so you don't have to worry about doing anything yourself at all. Check in was very quick and soon we were whisked to our room. We booked a Superior Ocean View...but they upgraded us to Premiere Ocean View Room (the only difference is that it's located on higher floors) The room, although I would say small in size (as much space has been devoted to the bathroom), is cosy and spacious. Nevertheless, if there are 3 to a room, you may feel a little bit tight. The room boasts many good technologies such as the BOSE surround sound and the large bathroom was a plus. Having been recently renovated in I think 2002? The rooms were free of stains, scratches, furniture wears etc. Now, I noticed that many of our fellow trip advisor members commented that the service here is a little bit \"cold\" and sometimes it's hard to get somebody's attention. This is infact, true, as this is quite a large hotel. Therefore, it does take a while for you to get the housekeeping or the bell boys to come up etc. However, in my opinion, it's not that long- so I didn't really mind. You must try the breakfast buffet at MELT- The World Cafe...I couldn't agree more with the other reviewers..it has a really large and extensive selection of all the food that you can ever imagine. I personally loved it. The other factor that I considered in choosing to stay here is because of its location. It's only a 5 minute walk to Esplanade- Theaters on the Bay, and Marina Square area. Also, the swimming pool area overlooks Marina Bay so we were front row for the fireworks on New Year's eve. I highly recommend this hotel for families as the atmosphere is very warm and friendly..and the pool area is quite large.

I felt that Singapore was very cheap but if you want to spend big bucks then head to Orchard Rd where all the boutique shops are - if your looking for something traditional, a bargain or electrical items at a great price then head to the markets at china town! In my opinion the price of the Hotel was very cheap considering what you pay for a basic hotel in England what you get at the oriental is loads for your money.

The air conditioning in the room, though, does not make it that cool and the bathroom can get quite warm. Melt-The World Caf\u00e9 has a great breakfast spread. There are several stations with everything you could possibly want. This is the only hotel buffet I have ever seen that serves pure maple syrup from upstate New York. They have it sitting along the waffle and pancake bar. I was very impressed. I never thought I would see pure maple syrup 9,000 miles away from the States. The downside to this place was the service. There was a long line to get a seat and the place was empty. They seemed to be understaffed. I could not get anyone\u2019s attention to bring me coffee even though they had looked at our table. We even returned to our table and everything was gone including silverware and cups. We had to wait to get new sets of everything, and getting them to clear the used plates was impossible even with staff looking at our table. I could not believe how bad the service was. It was completely different from any kind of Mandarin Oriental experience we have ever had. I hope it was just a coincidence and is not usually that bad. The pool area is great and it overlooks the road and has very cool night views of the harbor. Even though the pool closes around 9pm, they leave towels out and people swim after hours. As far as the location, the hotel is connected to the Marina Square mall, but you have to go out of the hotel a few feet and go up a very odd stairwell to get to the mall. The other option is walking toward the street and walking to the front of the mall. The hotel is very close to the Esplanade and all the food places there. The Esplanade seems to be a very popular area with lots of people hanging out there. The hotel is nearest to City Hall MRT but it is a little bit of a walk. But Singapore is such a walking-friendly city. We walked from the hotel to the Merlion, to Clarke Quay, and it is not that bad. We took a taxi back to the hotel though. We definitely would return to this hotel if the price was right, but we preferred the Conrad more because it felt warmer.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAsian delight..Deserves all the accolades!\u201d", "Author": "FrankDrebin", "ReviewID": "UR7795427", "Content": "I have just finished spending a week at The Oriental, Singapore and still feel the luxury that was lavished on me during my stay! On the advice of a work colleague I splurged for the Club Level room and I have to say it was money VERY well spent (or expensed as in my case.heheh) Anyway, regardless if I was paying personally I would have been happy to upgrade myself to the Club Level as it comes with a wealth of freebies including one-way Limo transfer to/from the Airport (an air conditioned Oasis once you hit the Singapore heat!), free breakfast which is abundant (including many hot items), cocktails between 5:30 - 7:30 and more. All of the food and drinks privileges are served on the 19th floor in the Club Lounge, which is beautifully decorated and enjoys fantastic views across Singapore (although it would have been better to have it on the City/Bay facing side.) My room was very nicely decorated with a beautifully large shower and separate bath. All amenities were top notch, however the 'standard' 27\" TV was a bit out of place considering the modern level of all the other bits and pieces. LCD's would be much more suitable. Apart from that everything was great and the wired Internet connection worked perfectly (if not very expensive. typical in Singapore however.) Complimentary wireless is available in the Club Lounge, another perk! The location of the hotel is perfect, being minutes away to the downtown financial district (perfect for work) as well as the shopping areas around town. The new waterfront/outdoor theatre is also right in front of the hotel and would be quite fascinating to see a performance from the Water-facing rooms! The service was immaculate in every level with personalised greetings most days from the entrance of the hotel, to the Club Lounge and everywhere in between. I have no idea how they knew who I was nor how they keep track but it's impressive nonetheless. The Gym/Pool area is great with the gym receiving a recent facelift. It is very well fitted out with an onsite trainer available. I also took advantage of the Oriental Spa (two nights in a row!) and I highly recommend the signature massage! So relaxing and tranquil (and I'm not a person who typically relaxes easily in those environments.) Overall you can definitely get the feeling that this hotel is very highly recommended. Great service, location, fit-out and so much more.

My only complaints are that the staff was not especially prompt - I had to ask twice to get a lightbulb replaced in my room, for example. Onsite services are exceedingly expensive, as mentioned in another review - I spent over $30 for a small salad and a glass of wine for lunch one day, and found the spa to be prohibitively expensive. We also had a terrible experience at the bar there - extremely slow and disjointed service for very poor quality drinks.

It also coincided with our wedding anniversary. We booked an ocean view double on line directly with the hotel - but upon arrival found we were 'upgraded' to a Harbour View twin (2 beds pushed together) due to the hotel being at 'full occupancy'. A bit disappointing, given the fact that we booked the room & had it confirmed by the hotel months before. The room itself was lovely, the pillows and bed the most comfortable I have ever slept on and the view from L12 superb - but I would rather have had the double room we had on our confirmation email. Still it was nicely appointed with good quality fittings, robes, towels, toiletries etc. We found everything outside the room was beyond our budget. Even the online rate (quoted on line in $USD different for each night) was converted to a common $SGP rate per night on arrival - presumably averaged out over the 2 nights. We had to sign our agreement to check in, leaving me wondering if we were being ripped off as I was not familiar with the $USD/$SGD/$AUD exchange - have to wait for the credit card bill to check! The shops & restaurants in the surrounding area were also expensive and quiet, and lacking in the genuine street life which for me is part and parcel of Asia. I found the location out of the way - the hotel we stayed at on previous visit (Meritus Mandarin) and later on our holiday (Oxford) were much better locations. We tried to get a drink at the round bar on level 4 but it was crowded and the door people asked us to wait (!!)so we headed out of the hotel for all of our food and drink after that. The foyer was beautiful but I found it rather dark and gloomy - no natural light at all. The final bill was $600 SGD including tax but no breakfast - we didnt do anything in the hotel at all other than sleep. I agree with others that the reception area was always busy and you felt like you being railroaded when you went there for anything.

This seemed over the top and we felt that a 5* hotel should have been more interested in welcoming us than trying to make a quick buck. On top of this we felt food and drink in the hotel was overpriced (drinks were actually cheaper in Raffles Hotel). We went to Morton's bar one night only to be told we could only have one drink as they were closing. My cocktail was the worst and most expensive Cosmopolitan I have ever had.

Toiletries and tea/coffee were replenished twice daily, and fresh fruit was put into the room each morning. There was a good roof top pool area with sun loungers, (but not enough umbrellas), and a spa which was very nice. The hotel also benefits from being located next to the Marina Mall - which can be accessed from the hotel forecourt. Location wise the Oriental is great. You are walking distance from the old Colonial areas of the city (Raffles landing point etc) and taxis are plentiful around the hotel. The downside to this hotel was the service. Whilst everyone was very polite, it was obvious that this is a hotel with a high turnover of guests. During our stay there were a number of conferences underway at the hotel, and also endless tour buses delivering, or collecting guests. This meant that reception was always busy, and you generally had to wait to speak to reception staff/concierge. When we were intially show to our room the receptionist left very quickly, and did not explain any of the room features. The tv/audio system was quite complicated to work and we would have appreciated them spending a little time to explain this. We had drinks in two of the hotels bars.

Definately try to get it included because it costs about S$45 per person if you pay on the day. They had there own little bakery cooking anything you wanted, eggs done anyway you liked, fresh squeezed juices in front of you etc etc etc... It really has too many food choices to list here, but you could never get bored with it and the service was just great and so quick. The location of the hotel is perfect. The Marina shopping centre it is attached to is one of the best we found in Singapore really. (MRT Station, great Restaurants, a bowling alley, cinemas and all the shops you could want.) The Merlion was an easy walk, river boat tours, fountain of wealth and Raffles Hotel. Watch those Singapore Slings though at S$44 for two at Raffles! But you gotta do it! We tried the MRT a couple of times but honestly the cabs are so very reasonable in price we just caught them in the end or walked. The night safari is a must-do and we enjoyed that immensely. We just caught a cab there and back from the Oriental which was under S$20.

There is a business center if you want to use a hotel computer for internet, which comes with a charge by the minute, the fitness center is tiny, the outdoor pool is very basic and not landscaped.

We picked the Oriental based upon the many great reviews on this site. We booked the \"Christmas Spendour\" package directly on the Oriental's website, promising a spacious City Suite with \"oversized tub\" and seperate shower. We checked in on Dec. 24th for one night, including breakfast at Melt - the World Cafe. First of all, when we checked in, there was no City Suite available and the receptionist told us that she was \"upgrading\" us to a harbour view room. This was not true, because the harbour/ocean view room was much smaller than the City Suite would have been. Unfortunately, I only found this out after our stay when I went back to the website to compare the rooms. Duped from the start! The room was ok - nice size, quite clean, and the surround sound on the stereo was very nice - we could hook up our iPod and listen to Christmas carols, and watch movies in surround sound. The tub was definitely NOT oversized. In fact, it was tiny - asian sized. The breakfast buffet at Melt was a nice spread with a bit of asian flavours along with western favourites. The service was not that great, we waited 25 minutes after being seated for someone to come by to offer us coffee. Throughout breakfast I had to get up to go and summon someone to please fill our coffee cups - definitely not 5 star service. At the end of our meal, we also got the bill and we had to remind them at checkout that breakfast was included in our package and had them remove the charges. Check your bill!! The pool area is in desperate need of a makeover - the yellow lounger covers are dirty and grimy, and the towels provided are frayed and faded. Also, no drinks are served around the pool so if you want that tropical cocktail, forget it. Also, very crowded with loads of screaming children in a quite small area. There is also contruction going on next door on the Marina so be prepared to listen to a lot of noise. We went for spa treatments on xmas day and it was really nice. Except there are no spa facilities such as jacuzzi, whirlpool, sauna or steambath. Basically, you go in get your massage and get out again. Nothing special and not really worth the SGD$165 I paid for a 85 minute massage. My husband got the \"Shiatsu\" massage but was dissapointed because they didn't even use the bars from the ceiling to walk on his back.

We took the Club Room option which was well worth the money. We were checked in in the room and were greeted with fresh flowers, fruit and a bottle of wine - fantastic. We have never stayed at a hotel with so many curteous staff available to do your bidding, nothing was too much trouble We tried the Club Room for breakfast on the first morning and it was very nice but the choice was limited. We then switched to the \"Melt\" Cafe (at no extra cost) which was little less than astounding, such an amazing choice of food and all well cooked and presented. Again the staff were efficient and attentive. We only managed Afternoon Tea in the Club Room once and it was very nice but limited to small cakes and tea/soft drinks etc. Unfortunately we never made it for coctails and canapes in the evening. We would advise paying the extra for the Club perks which in our case was good because it meant we didn't have to check out until 8pm which was useful since our flight was at midnight. This may or not be of interest but when we arrived at Changi Airport from the UK we looked at using the Shuttle Taxi to the hotel. The normal price is S$7 per person but we were told that we would have to wait up to an hour for a shuttle. They then tried to persuade us to take a shuttle for just the two of us at a cost of S$35 which they could provide immediately - what a con! We eventually got a taxi which cost S$15. The moral of the story is don't even think about getting the Shuttle just get a taxi - it's cheaper and quicker. In summary, if we go to Singapore again we will most definitely stay at the Oriental and wil be advising family and friends to do so as well.", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hoboken, NJ USA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay\u201d", "Author": "Shine13", "ReviewID": "UR6230983", "Content": "Stayed over thanksgiving for 3 nights in the club harbor room.

After reading all of the reviews, I had a very hard time choosing a hotel. When I approached my husband, he came up with the idea of staying at a couple of hotels, each for three or four nights. We ended up staying at The Oriental, The Ritz Carlton, The Shangri-la, and The Sentosa Resort and Spa. The Oriental was by far the unanimous favorite. Our stay at the Oriental was phenomenal. The accommodations were exquisite, but more importantly the service was unmatched by any other hotel in Singapore. We stayed in a city suite with club access. We booked the Suite Success package, which included a luxury airport transfer. We were actually arriving by ferry, and the hotel was very nice and willing to pick us up at the ferry terminal. When we exited the ferry terminal (along with 150 other passengers) we greeted by name by the driver (don't ask me how he knew who we were, we are still puzzled over that one) and transferred by Mercedes to the hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted at the steps of the hotel (once again by name) by a very kind lady. She immediately showed us right up to our room where she checked us in. She also provided to us a letter that detailed all of our included amenities during our stay. (This was a very nice touch, since often times you miss out on things that were actually included, because you didn't ask.) Staying in the City Suite was a little more expensive, but well worth the extra money. The extra benefits we received practically paid for themselves. Access to the club lounge, complimentary laundry pressing service, late checkout in the club lounge, fresh fruit, complimentary internet access, and a gigantic room made us feel like we were royalty. There was even an extra 1/2 bath that was convenient when you have a spouse that hogs the bathroom. Every single employee of the hotel went out of their way to accommodate all of our needs. After a long day at the Singapore Zoo we arrived about 10 minutes late for hors d\u2019oeuvres in the club lounge. We decided to go up to the lounge anyway to get a drink. Upon arrival to the lounge, we were seated and told that they had just put away the food, but she would fill us up a plate in the kitchen (with a little of everything) and bring it to us. She went out of her way, and it made all the difference. When it was time to checkout and move on to the next hotel, we didn\u2019t want to leave. For the next 8 days, while staying at the Ritz Carlton and Shangri-la, everything was just okay. Yes, these other hotels are very nice, but compared to the service we received at the Oriental, they were disappointing. My advice to you is, stay at the Oriental. If you are determined to compare the other hotels, just make sure to make the Oriental the last hotel you stay in, because everything else dulls in comparison to the service you receive at the Oriental. Don\u2019t do what we did, and spend the rest of your trip saying, \u201cWell, at the Oriental \u2026\u2026\u201d When we return to Singapore, we will definitely return and stay the entire trip at The Oriental.", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cOk Business Hotel but not great\u201d", "Author": "Sydney-AP", "ReviewID": "UR5982545", "Content": "Having read all the reviews on Tripadvisor I tried the Oriental in both Club and standard rooms.

We first stayed there for 3 nights, then flew to Jakarta for a few days, and came back to The Oriental Singapore for 8 more nights. We booked everything through AMEX that gave us a good deal. Before arrival, we have exchanged emails with the hotel to confirm and reconfirm our booking. Our reserved room was for Deluxe Oceanview room. We also inquired about their airport transfer services and was told it would cost Sing$60 one way with a Mercedez Benz 200 series. We decided to take a cab instead since they're plenty available in Singapore and cheaper too. We arrived with bleary eyes @ 1am at the hotel after a 20-hour flight from Chicago. At first glance, the lobby was quite modern looking with marble surface all around and some water fountains that created that soothing feeling as we entered. I think they just renovated the hotel recently because everything still looked new. The check-in staff was courteous, friendly, and very helpful. To our delightful surprise, they told us that our room has been upgraded to a Club Level Harbour View room. However, my husband wanted to try out their suite since we knew both of us would be suffering from jetlag for the next few days so it would help to have a separate living room so that when one of us couldn't sleep, one could watch TV in another room without bothering the other. We got our suite on the 18th floor with Sing$190 extra per night which included all the Club Floor amenities (upgraded champagne breakfast for 2, fresh flowers and fruits daily, free internet access at the lounge, late afternoon cocktail with snacks, and guaranteed late checkout until 8pm). The suite was spacious and whistle clean with marble surface all around and modern contemporary design, a living room with step-out balcony and a decent size restroom with double sinks as well as study desk with leather desk amenities + high-speed internet access hookup, the bedroom has an armoire with TV, DVD player, video player, and one touch control from the night stand and big window for the water view, it also has big bathroom (all marble) with separate bathtub / shower / commode / double vanity area. The next day, we went to check their Champagne breakfast at the executive lounge and didn't like the selections (it mostly offers western types of breakfast) so we went down to 'The Melt Cafe' that has better choices with local taste. We asked that our breakfast be switched to 'The Melt' instead of the Champagne Breakfast (I dislike alcohol so I can't imagine drinking Champagne first thing in the morning with your breakfast!), and our request was granted without problem. The Melt buffet breakfast offers several dining stands: fresh fruit stand with a guy ready to help cut up your tropical fresh fruit selections or juice them for you, dessert stand, bakery stand, eggs/noodles stand with chinese dim-sum and sliced meat, american breakfast stand that has the usual bacon / omelet / scrambled eggs stuff, Indian cuisine stand, Malay cuisine stand that has Malay's Nasi Lemak and Chinese style porridges, and continental breakfast stand. Each stand offers roughly 10-15 choices of food so you'll definitely find one that you like. It has friendly and great customer service, fast, clean, and everything was run efficiently. During our stay for the second time, out jetlag was over so we decided to stick with our original reservation (Deluxe Oceanview Room) and again we got upgraded to the Club Level Harborview room on the 16th floor. We still received our fresh flowers and fresh fruits daily although we no longer received the club level amenities. That's fine since we were out most of the time anyway. The room was almost identical in layout minus the separate living room and the second restroom. All the amenities were the same as the ones we got at the suite (terry bathrobes, slippers, nice size shampoos / conditioners / bathgels, toothbrushes, sewing kit, cotton balls and sticks, soaps, etc). Everytime we went down to the lobby, there were always a few staff available to either help with the elevators or any other help you needed (even when the check-in desk was crowded there were always staff available to help you immediately). The room-service was always fast with the food delivered still hot and delicious. The staff was knowledgeable about their country and its places of interest. The hotel is situated next to Marina Square, a dept store with great food court on the 3rd floor. You can also go across the street to the Esplanade and do a bit of walking along the panoramic Singapore river bank. When we checked out this time, our flight back home wouldn't leave until 10.00pm so we requested a late checkout @ 7.30pm and it was granted free of charge without problem.

We booked the hotel following the consistenty positive reviews read on Tripadvisor and we would have to say that we were very impressed. We booked a city view room, but on the first stay were upgraded to a Harbour View room and on the second stay an Ocean View room. There is some construction work going on next door but we did not notice any major noise or disruptions. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurants to be honest so can't comment on those. The adjoining shopping centre is really good, with quite a few eating options, and there is also an outdoor hawker market across from the hotel on the Esplanade. The breakfast though is simply awesome, (we had it included in our room rate - very much recommended) we have been lucky enough to have done a fair bit of travelling in the last 10 years or so and we have stayed in other 5 star hotels in a number of countries, including a previous stay in Singapore and the breakfast at the Oriental is by far the best experienced. The choice of food, from Indian (may sound strange but boy it was good) to freshly made pancakes (my wifes favourite) is fantastic. The service was also faultless, and genuine too from our experience. For example on one occasion I went to reception to arrange a late checkout and taxi to the airport. The reception area was really busy and I realised that it was 11am when quite a few people were checking out, so I thought I'd leave it till later. On the way back to the lifts, a member of staff approached me who had noticed that I had wanted something but had left. She rode up in the lift with me, made a note of what I required and called our room 30 mins later to confirm late checkout, taxi booking and alarm call. I was very impressed by that. The gym is also pretty good and the pool is nice although I must say the pool area is fairly bland and could maybe do with more gardening perhaps. There is a good view from the pool area though. The hotel seemed very interested in customer comments and feedback and I would assume based on our experience that they are acting on this response.

This hotel is ideally situated on the harbor across from the skyscrapers and you would be a fool not to spring the extra $50SGD to get a harbor view room. I spent much time observing the daily changes to the rhythm of the city during my seven night stay. I spend about two months out of the year on the road and make it a habit to try to stay in good places. Let me tell you, this place knocked my socks off it was so good. Perfection? No, but pretty close. The only hotel I would rate higher is in Montreal (Gault) and is totally different in approach. The hotel is an atrium style, but not at all that 'mid western' cow-town atrium feel. It's elegant and golden. There is more marble and granite in this hotel than I have seen in any other. It's all done tastefully though and not garish. The pool is wonderful and warm and looks directly out over downtown. Make sure you take time to swim here; it's deep too and there is a separate pool for the piddling types (crumbcrunchers). The room (see the pictures) is the nicest I have ever stayed in; incredibly well designed and it has the only bathroom in a hotel I have ever felt compelled take a photograph of. Service in the room was superior, but not intrusive. Previous posts have referred to the breakfast in the hotel. Well, let me tell you, there is nothing like it anywhere I have travelled. It had by my count, Japanese, Malaysian, American, Chinese and European style breakfast foods. You could also get anything you wanted made to order. The downside is that this cost $41.95 SGD. Good advice, and it's a piece I will take next time I stay here: get a breakfast inclusive rate. The one word for this morning repast: Incredible! (really, they have 9, count 'em, 9 types of freshly squeezed juices!) Room service was incredibly prompt, if a bit pricey. Make sure you eat in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. It can be described as a 'jewel box' and is one of the prettiest dining rooms I have ever sat in. The food is excellent as well. Also a great deal is the happy hour in the Morton's bar. This is from 5-7pm and includes reasonably mixed cocktails, but the best part are the free filet mignon sandwiches they bring around (from Morton's). The place packs full at 5pm, so get there early for a preprandial libation and snack. Now for the nits: 1. They tried to adjust my rate up from $239SGD by saying that was only a weekend rate. I was having none of this and after dealing with three people I finally talked to the duty manager. She assured me my rate would remain fixed throughout my stay (and it did...I made sure to check the bill the night before leaving). 2. Avoid the restaurant called Dolce Vita. It sits right poolside, which might provide you with a water show if there are any hot Aussies around, but the restaurant is dreary and and we walked out after seeing the 'moonshot' prices for the prix fixe only menu (and no, it's not Italian, rather a bizarro fusion menu.) That's when we went to the Chinese place. That's it for the nits and I am very picky. My business here was work, so the sybaritic pleasures of the hotel took a while to get into my skin (the massage and facial helped on the last day $190SGD). If you like the finer things in life, this place will make you happy. Note to self: remember to go next door to the Ritz-Carlton bar next time. Last words?

Both stays were enjoyed by all. July was with our two children, and we paid for a City View rooms. We asked for connecting rooms and got that plus an upgrade to Water Views room for both. The decor was subdued Oriental: ivory, black, beige, brown. The beds were perfect, as were the pillows, not too soft and not too firm. The sound system in the room was excellent (there was a subwoofer). The toilet and bath were marble, and there was a shower with an all glass door. A clear effort was made to make toilet plumbing as unnoticeable as possible, ie, the water closet was hidden behind a marble wall with a heavy marble lid (I know coz I tried to lift it). Our August trip was also for a City View room but we got upgraded to a Water View room (again!) as it was our second time. And we were lucky enough to catch the fireworks shows for the National Day in the comfort of our bedroom - what good timing! Both stays we opted for the buffet breakfast, and it was a fantastic way to start your day. The variety and quantity of food, as well as the service were excellent. I did notice though that the female wait staff were more prompt, and courteous than the male wait staff. The breakfast choices were: fruit juices and I was able to request for watermelon juice which they prepared for me; eggs any way you want it; pancakes and waffles with various toppings; Indian curries and breads; Chinese congee and dimsum; bacon, sausages, hash browns; croissants and pastries; yoghurt; cereal; plus many types of cut fruit. We also had room service for mains, and they added complimentary entrees, not a huge serving but a nice touch as it was individually presented as you would in fine dining. The outdoor pool was a great way to relax, the prices for alcoholic drinks were a bit steep though. About S$18 net. The Oriental is beside a shopping mall, and about S$5 to Orchard road by cab. So, if shopping is your main purpose for visiting Singapore, then the Oriental is convenient. We did our shopping in July for the sales. In August we decided to go for more sightseeing than shopping, and the Oriental's proximity to Suntec was a bonus. There were tour buses that started and ended at Suntec and it was easy for us to board whenever we wanted to. If we needed to go back to the hotel, we were in and out of Suntec in 30 minutes, which is when the buses come and go. The staff were very helpful, and courteous. Always with a greeting and a smile. We plan to stay with the Oriental whenever we go to Singapore and will not think twice about recommending it.

Having read all the reviews prior to my departure I was excited at the prospect of staying in the 'second most popular' hotel in the city (according the trip advisor at the time). In retrospect perhaps my expectations were a little too high. We were in the city for a mixture of business and pleasure. It was my fifth trip to Singapore but the first at the Oriental. Having arrived in early evening we were welcomed with a smile and a what seemed to be a hundred 'welcomes'. It was all very civilised and after a relatively long flight, very welcome. Check -in was smooth and in no time were we admiring the view accross the Harbour, over the 'durians' to the CBD. I would recommend a harbour view room every time. Having said this our euphoria at our 'Singapore adventure' was to show signs of cracking early the next day. There is construction happening on the Esplanade across from the hotel which meant machinery of varying volumes operating at all times of the day (and for a large part of the night as well). On one particularly bad day a barge mounted drill hammered holes in the ground from 9am in the morning until 8pm that night. What seemed to sound like minor explosions occuring every 3 seconds (I timed them). It was hellish. Unfortunately the pool area offered no respite as it works are virtually next to the pool. As others have noted, the food prices are out of this world. While you have to assume they will not be 'normal' rates, what bugged us most was the fact that you could never get the accurate prices before ordering. For example a poolside 'special of the day' appeared to list a variety of drinks at the (comparatively reasonable) price of S$10. It was only when we were asked to sign were we made aware that it was actually S$22. When we questioned it we were told that a coconut drink was the only drink available at the special rate and that everything else on the 'specials board' was the normal price. This may only be a minor inconvenience for expense account clients, but for people paying out of their own pockets it comes as a shock (especially for an Australian trade practices lawyer like myself). In the end it was sorted out after my wife complained. The next day the board listed all prices appropriately. We wonder how many others were caught by the 'oversight' however. The next drama was when I checked internet banking and discovered the hotel had 'blocked' an additional $1,000 from my credit card. I can understand a slight increase to cover incidentals, but the extra $1k represented an almost 35% increase over what was payable for the entire week stay. We were shocked. The (always polite) reception staff informed us it was to cover any additional costs of the stay, (and made a point of saying the mini bar was the major culprit). I wonder how many guests had helped themselves to $150 worth of mars bars and coke PER DAY. Eventually, when pressed further they admitted that the amount blocked was discretionary, but in our case they decided to block the maximum!!! Not good for the ego.........Perhaps my position as a Partner at an International Law Firm (under which the booking was made) brands me a notorious mini-bar raider. Given the size of some of my colleagues maybe such a reputation is justified - I'll never know! Another issue arose when my wife inadvertently took the key card to the room while I went to the lobby. You need the key to get to your floor in the lift. 'Security' required me to present my passport (a drivers licence with my name would just not do) in order to prove that I was the person staying in the room. The fact that my passport was in my room, and they would not accept anything else for ID created an unnecessary drama which could have been avoided with some common sense. It was, after all, my fifth day in the hotel and the person now demanding my passport had was the same person who checked me in. Notwithstanding this, I was told in no uncertain terms that I was not to leave the lobby area until such time as I could produce my passport. I should have shaved that morning! To sum up. The rooms were ok (but as expected for a 5 star) and the view was spectacular. However, the 'service' which I had heard so much about left a lot to be desired. Perhaps I'm jaded by our personal experiences with the staff and the 'system', but in the end the service all felt a bit fake to me. On to some positives! The hotel is linked directly to Marina Square shopping centre which has perhaps the best food court in Singapore (and trust me , I've been to a few). On that culinary note, across the road is Glutton Bay with a number of fantastic (but touristy) hawker stalls. It gets busy, so go early. It is a pleasent walk to Boat Quay past the Merlion and the Fullarton Hotel (our next hotel if we return). The MRT (City Hall) is quite a walk through a number of different shopping centres, but there is always something to look at. Alternatively, cabs are a cheap and easy option to pretty much anywhere in the city. For the same price there are a number of better alternatives in Singapore.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat service - above average room\u201d", "Author": "Milkee", "ReviewID": "UR5515092", "Content": "We stayed at the Oriental in early July 06 for 4 nights as part of a 21 night Singapore - Thailand holiday. We arrived at the hotel at 11.00pm after a enjoyable flight from Australia. We were greeted by pretty much everyone in the foyer at the time of arrival. The lobby looks great at night. The service is brilliant. We were promptly escorted to our rooms and our bags arrived minutes later. We had asked about the Melt breakfast as our rate did not include it. We were told that it would be AUD $55 for both of us to have breakfast each day. We politely declined. If you can organise with your agent for a cheaper rate get it, otherwise, we found that there are plenty of places in Singapore that serve Kaya Toast (so good we brought two jars home with us) and coffee for two people for less than AUD $8. You just have to walk a little (less than 1 km). I reckon there was about 7 within the malls directly near the hotel. The best was at the Raffles Hotel cafe about just over 1 km walk (the one recommended in the lonely planet guide) through the numerous air-conditioned malls near the hotel. The rooms .... we stayed in a city view room. The view wasn't really of the city but of the back of Suntec Mall and another hotel. A little disapointing but i wasn't in the room to look at the view, you can do that on your adventures around the city. The bathroom is brilliant. The products in the room smell fantastic. The bath is massive and the shower was a rain shower and entirely marble. The rest of the room was a little dated for a 5 star hotel. I expected much better from the reviews on this website. The room was spotless, had a large floorspace and a good choice of TV channels (it had ABC Asia which showed an AFL game late one night!!!). It was nonetheless pleasant without being modern or over the top. The minibar prices were ridiculous but you expect that. The best part of the room is definitely the bathroom. Speaking of ridiculous, the prices of food within the hotel are outrageous compared to Australian prices and prices for other Asian hotel i have stayed in. For instance a steak will cost AUD $75+, 2 noodle/rice dishes and a chocolate desert cost us well over AUD$65 (room service), and alcoholic drinks of any description start around AUD$8-9. Needless to say, we only ate at the hotel for that one room service. Otherwise, go to Boat/Clarke quay, get a chilli crab (Brilliant!!!!!), pineapple rice, spring rolls and a few tiger beers/cocktails (with a perfect view) for around AUD$60-70 for 2. If you're fit you can walk it, if you can't be bothered a taxi will only cost about AUD$5-7. Lunch around the city is also very good and cheap. The pool is good. It has a beautiful view of the harbour but has the ambience of an empty olympic sized swimming pool. If you want it for the sole purpose of swimming after a long day at the shops or zoo it is perfect, but compared to other pools in Asia, it it would be very average but for the view. On the whole, it is a great hotel but food and drink is pricey by Australian and local Singapore standards. I probably wouldn't stay there again but only beacuse i would want to compare another hotel to this one. Having said that, i would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking of staying there. From reading the comments on this website, i would probably recommend you get the club room. From memory, it wasn't that much more per night and the breakfast/drinks/ canapes you consume would offset the initial payment. Btw, Singapore on the whole is brilliant (4 days and you can see it all). The zoo is a must, chilli crab is soooo good, shopping in the malls, whilst extensive, is as expensive as Australia so you will find that you only buy what you really want.

I was very impressed with the hotel and service, but really began to appreciate it when I switched hotels to begin the \"business\" part of my trip (where I had no control over picking the hotel!). I opted for the airport pickup service from the Changi. When I arrived at the hotel, a check in person met me at the car and led me to my room. It was all very Bill Murray in Lost in Translation. Let me say one thing here-- I booked the absolute cheapest room rate via the Oriental website (113USD) so it's not like I was some VIP. We did the check in procedures in the room. The room itself was nice without being overly flashy. Even though I booked a normal room, they gave me a harbor view room, which was nice. It was the not very apparent features which I really liked. For instance, the bathtub had a can of sea salts, which I admit is something stupid to like as much as I did. I did, however, really like the fact that the hotel provided toothbrushes and razor kits. And an ironing board/iron. And an umbrella (which I didn't realize was there until I called the front desk to request the use of one for the day). The service was quite good. Taxis came immediately (which I didn't pay attention to until I kept having to wait 5 minutes for a taxi when I switched to The Regent). And the staff was helpful without being overbearing. I always got the \"good morning\" and \"good evenings\", but they were never overly intrusive, which I have often found at other hotels. The spa was also very nice.

The first time, in February, was very shortly after the hotel\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d reopening. Aesthetically, the redo is a huge success. While the hotel retains its rather nondescript exterior shape and square windows in a big white block of a building, the interior of the Oriental is now arguably the most striking of all hotels in Singapore. While most hotels built around an atrium recall the 80s even more pointedly than, say, Duran Duran cassette tapes and hair bands, the Oriental\u2019s atrium is now dazzling, with mica-flecked black marble, pin-lighted water feature, and gorgeous dark woods everywhere. The staff are immaculate, the ladies in particular: their uniforms are very Singapore Airlines-meets-Asian Bond girls. As one often does in Singapore, I arrived very late in the evening and was tired. The Oriental\u2019s sleek new interior and flawless staff immediately soothed. The front-desk clerk talked me into an S$90/night upgrade to a Club room, which turned out to be the same as a regular room but on a higher floor than my original room. Staff scurried in to replace stock MO amenities with Hermes, and someone else brought hot tea and a scented face towel. Aah. (Actually, the last two services come with all MO rooms.) The room, while smallish (34 m2), was beautiful: more dark woods and black marble, and an up-to-the minute bathroom with separate, walk-in rain shower; and glass wall with wooden blinds separating bed from bath rooms. My room had a dead-on view of Singapore\u2019s harbor and attractive CBD skyline. Room service food was delicious and not overly expensive. Problems began the next morning (Saturday), when hammering and other construction noises began fairly early (shortly before 9 a.m.). I called the front desk to ask what was going on and was told that renovation work was still occurring on the uppermost floors \u2013 what would become the real Club rooms \u2013 and outside. I headed to the Club Lounge for breakfast, hoping that I might be able to sleep a bit more afterward. The lounge is brand new and spectacular: two-storey windows overlooking the city from the 21st floor, and rich yet muted Asian-modern d\u00e9cor. The breakfast buffet was fresh, luxurious, and plentiful, including fairly good champagne (Piper-Heidsieck). Sated, I returned to my room and was able to sleep some more, as the construction crews had mercifully scaled down the pace and decibel level of their work Later in the day, I stopped by the front desk to discuss my concerns about the noises and what I thought had been a bit of a hard sell for a Club room that was only partly so. As is usually the case with MO staff I\u2019ve experienced in Asia, the duty manager was thoughtful and responsive. He took the supplemental club charge off of my room rate (for 2 nights), apologized for the noise, and assured me that I could move to another room if the work \u2013 scheduled for a shorter period \u2013 continued on Sunday. I went for a swim, and some laps the new pool put my cares behind me. The temperature-controlled infinity pool overlooks the city skyline, and the spa facilities and wet area are every bit as lovely as the rest of the hotel. When I returned to my room from my swim, I found a bottle of Shiraz and a very nice note from the duty manager, again apologizing for earlier problems. Sunday was just fine, with no construction noise and a good morning\u2019s sleep. Upon returning home, I had a very nice e-mail from Ms Cindy Kong, the Oriental\u2019s guest-relations manager. She again apologized for the problems I\u2019d encountered and asked me to contact her directly concerning future stays to ensure proper care. I did contact Ms Kong again, as I was planning another visit to Singapore at the end of April and first week of May, bookends to a week in Bali. She assured me that construction work would be finished and that I would have an excellent, quiet room. That proved to be the case; this time I stayed in a Club room on the Club floor, and everything was great. I was looking forward to my return a week later. Ms Kong e-mailed me while I was in Bali to let me know that a new construction project (this time, a municipal endeavor at adjacent Marine Square) would be taking place during my anticipated stay, and she offered not only to help with a booking at another hotel but also to have me picked up upon arrival at Changi Airport and taken in an MO car to the alternate hotel. Again, MO\u2019s outstanding customer service impressed. My third stay with the Oriental was in September, and this time the hotel offered me an ocean-view room at a very good rate. Unfortunately, I timed my stay to coincide exactly with a weekend of daylong F1 speedboat races \u2013 on the water, well within earshot of the hotel. I contacted the Front Desk, and staff offered to give me free use of a City Room, away from the water-facing sides of the hotel, for sleeping during the day. (I note here that the standard City rooms, while pleasant and comfortable, have noticeably blander d\u00e9cor and furnishings than the Ocean and Harbor View rooms. Staff advised that City rooms are usually assigned to package-tour customers. In any event, my City day room was a blessed respite from the constant whining of racing speedboats.) I joked with the duty manager that perhaps I have bad feng shui at the Oriental, given my star-crossed stays to date. Unfortunately, the joke or bad FS continued a bit further: later on, while I was relaxing after the boat races in my Ocean room, a harsh chemical smell seeped into the room. I opened the door and the reek of kerosene in the hallway or similar brought tears to my eyes. I flagged down a maid, who reported that a maintenance worker had spilled paint in the storage room at the end of the hall and had dumped a large quantity of turpentine on the paint still to try to clean up. A few other guests had also been flushed out of their rooms, seeking the source of the fumes. I informed the front desk of the problem and then went for a long swim. When I returned to my floor, the paint-thinner odor had subsided a bit but was still fairly harsh. I had a message on my room voicemail from guest relations. When I called back, the duty manager apologized again and asked me whether the hotel could move me and my things to a City View suite. I readily agreed. The suite was wonderful \u2013 and huge (about 70 m2). Rather than replicating the drabness of the regular City rooms, the suite was very sleekly furnished and decorated, with a separate bedroom, two bathrooms, and expansive city views. Well done, Oriental! Oh, I had breakfast (included in my room rate) in the just-opened Melt restaurant, which has several huge food stations featuring dishes -- all fresh and very delicious -- from all over the world. The Indian station was my favorite for savories, and the Western breakfast-y baked goods were to die for. Although I\u2019ve not yet stayed again at the Oriental \u2013 I stayed at Raffles on my most recent trip to Singapore \u2013 I probably would stay there again. It really is a beautiful hotel, and the staff are perhaps the best I\u2019ve encountered (with the possible exception of those of Peninsula Hotels). I still attribute the problems I had at the Oriental to bad luck, or possibly bad feng shui, which perhaps one shouldn\u2019t take lightly in a predominantly Chinese culture. Nonetheless, the Oriental richly deserves the very positive rankings and reviews it\u2019s received since its very successful makeover. If one can get a good corporate or promotional rate (my cheapest stay was S$188/night), the Oriental may be the best hotel stay in Singapore.", "Date": "February 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMy Taste Buds Melted....\u201d", "Author": "TheTravellingGourmet", "ReviewID": "UR4470270", "Content": "Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet is a renowned Travel, Food & Wine Writer in Asia MELT the World Cafe at The Oriental Singapore melted my tastebuds....There are many mega-buffets now not only in sunny Singapore, but also in places like Hong Kong.
