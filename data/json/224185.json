When I first checked in, I asked to see the room before it was assigned to me. I head to the room, located on the 2nd floor. Opened the door and almost fainted from the stench. Whatever it was, it was awful and I knew I would never want to smell that smell again. I head back and request for another room. I was told there weren't any available til Wed (it was Monday), and that most likely the smell was from smoke. However, I know what smoke smells like and that wasn't it. But it already was supposed to be a non-smoking room??? He tells me that all of their non-smoking rooms are on the 1st flr (for an extra fee). How convenient! So I change to the 1st flr one, which is better b/c there are no elevators at this facility. So was I satisfied??? Of course not....roach infested city!!! I spent the majority of my night killing roaches. On the bed, on the walls, paintings, in the tv (yes, they were crawling from out of the tv), fridge, behind bathroom mirrors, shower wall. It was ridiculous. I took pictures and complained. They sprayed and then MORE CAME. By that time, I was crying and the manager switched my reservations to a location on Horizon Lake Dr (5 stars). Overall I guess the staff was helpful. I mean, how could you be rude to me at this point. If the room was habitable, I'm sure I would be able to tell if the staff is generally nice. The location is convenient but the area doesn't scream creme de la creme either. Signs posted all around, \"Park at your own risk\", literally. Even when it was sunny out, the room was still gloomy with shades open. Its definitely not a vacation spot. More so for ppl (probably the ones who keep saying this is an excellent spot) who really need to crash till whenever. And I get that, but if I knew I would be sharing my room with \"pets\", I would've booked accordingly.

My dog laid on the carpet for the first five minutes and then my husband and I noticed, she hated being on the carpet any time after that the three days we stayed here over the Thanksgiving weekend. We had to work Friday so we booked it to visit family nearby. I had to beg for soap, forks and cooking utensils despite the fully-equipped kitchen promise. I asked for more blankets because our window didn't shut and they would not give us any more blankets. (Too bad we didn't bring our camping supplies.) My husband saw cockroaches in the bathroom. Our bathroom door and the front door looked like it had been beaten in during a really bad fight. I washed down all surfaces with some soap and it made the cloth brown. The coffee pot had not even been washed fromt he past guest. I was able to get a few sheets to throw over the recliner (it was badly stained and looked like it had lots of dirt on it, but we needed it because both my husband and I had to work on Friday). The internet worked okay and the fridge kept our food from the bugs so, like I said, it was like camping. With the dog fee, we paid close to $70/night. The bright side was there was a Starbucks around the corner where we could be in a clean environment as a break. The shower did work well, but for sure we kept our flip flops on. I used a plastic liner to shield my tooth-brush, hair-brush and other items from the room. The garbage can had never been cleaned and even had dirty peelings and filth from many moons of garbage in it. I just took that can to the lobby and gave it to the receptionist. Sitting in the room it was like a bug breeder so I couldn't take it. It was like camping, except without the fresh air. Oh! But we almost did have a fire because the toaster was so old and crappy it set off the fire alarm which i couldn't turn off so I just opened the door. We travel around the world. It's bad when you're dog won't touch the floor. They know more than we did. At least we didn't get eaten by the bed bugs another couple reports. But for sure we saw the stains on the box spring another traveller reported. I feel sorry for myself I didn't \"scroll down\" and read all the reviews here before booking. That teaches me quite a lesson for future review reviewing.

The hotel is 20 min or less from all the main things, airport, beale street, graceland, mall, zoo etc. and so easy to find! There are a number of fast food places about 30 seconds drive away and also a couple of stores, which are great for stocking up the fridge. I'm not used to the southern heat so having a fridge and freezer to fill with drinks and Ice was great. I stayed in a Signature suite and my room was a great size, not huge, but big enough. I had a friend stay for a week, and there was still plenty of room for the both of us. My bathroom was spotless when I arrived. The paint was a little worn, but certainly nothing was dirty. I stayed in a number of similar places when I was in the US, and this was the first one I didnt spend the first day bleaching, or feel the need to wear flip-flops in the shower. My room was on the ground floor, by the office. I didnt notice any traffic whilst i was there, and appart from someone setting off the fire alarm once at 9am, every night was undisturbed. I really cant reccomend this place enough. Obviously it's not the Ritz, it's cheap and chearfull but has everything you could need. Also, the staff are lovely and made me feel right at home. This place really is perfect If you want to save some money. The rooms are amazing value and the cooking facilities saved me a fortune on dining out. It's in a pretty ok area of town, I was 21, female and travelling mostly alone and I always felt safe and welcomed in the neighborhood. I met another traveler who was staying at a similar hotel further along sycamore. After seing my room they actually switched hotels. there was only about a $3 difference, but my place was undoubtably cleaner, brighter, friendlier and didnt have a wierd smell. I've already booked this hotel for my next trip to memphis p.s there isn't free internet but it's about $5 for the duration of your stay, and it's pretty fast.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "cleveland,ms", "Title": "\u201cNICE, CLEAN,AND AFFORDABLE WITH SOME(NOT ALL) NEW ROOMS\u201d", "Author": "lrob38732", "ReviewID": "UR65127765", "Content": "i had a wonderful experience at this extended stay. i was hesitant to stay after reading some other reviews so when i arrived i asked to take a look at the room before checking in, in which the staff working didnt mind. i checked out the first room but prefered another one. i stayed in the newly renovated signature suite and it was very clean and bed was comfy. there was all new flooring and decor. the room i originally booked(queen signature suite) wasnt available but the staff upgraded me to a king signature suite anfd made the price 45$ a night! on the day of my expected leave we overslept so i called the front desk and asked to extend my stay for one day and they were nice about it and let me extend it without a problem....the regular rate for my room was 65$ but my total for 3 nights was only 136$ including tax. overall i enjoyd the stay and i've already booked another stay there for july...a signature suite!", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, TN", "Title": "\u201cThe Hotel Stay Exceeded my Expectations\u201d", "Author": "Bernie1968", "ReviewID": "UR58238385", "Content": "I was concerned due to the previous reviews but the hotel stay exceeded my expectations.
