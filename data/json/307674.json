It's near the tramway, making it easy to get around to less touristy areas of the city as well as other transportation centers - the train and bus stations, the ferry ports, etc. The front desk staff (Cem and Sukru) were very helpful, too, always ready to provide advice on how to get around and where to eat, tidbits about Turkish culture and history, etc. I've read on on some forums that a few people disliked the small breakfasts, but we found them just fine and ate breakfast at Zeugma every morning - they're not small at all, and you can pick and choose what and how much to eat (buffet style). Mrs. Tuna, who does both the breakfast service and room cleaning, is a sweet and friendly woman.
