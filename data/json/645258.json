Another positive thing was that our room was cleaned every day and we had floor heating! which was very nice, espeacially for such a good price :25 euros for two people including breakfast) but: there were some things that we engoyed less. first of all the rooms are mini!!! you can hardly put your bag somewhere, between there was maybe just a distance of 50 cm!! but i also heard that in istanbul the room are often like this and sometimes you pay much more and also get a really small room. i think the room was not bigger than 10 m\u00c2\u00b2. the bathroom was not really comfortable. there was no courtain so after taking the shower everything was wet and the shower was fossil and the toilet bowl was also not the newest and therefor it had some brown sediments... but if you just pay 5 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac more 8actually we wanted to chage the room but in the end we were to lazy to pack everything etc) you get a room with air condition, heating, and a more or less new bathroom (where you can close the shower) which i think is worth it. the breakfast in my opinion is a desaster. you don't get normal coffee but only nescafe with milk powder (sometimes they have normal milk). we went there at 9.30 (it is supposed to be served untill 10) and so many times nothing fresh was left. there iss butter, marmelade, cream cheese and some strage but tasty turkish spreads, sometimes there are tomatos, cheese and eggs, but mostly they was nothing of it left when we came. no fresh fruit, no fresh drink, only some coloured and very sweet \"juices\". in the end i really liked the hotel, because of the peolpe. i was happy to meet eniz (the owner) who invited us for coffe and tea when we came back late after the whole day of walking threw the cold. he offered me to bring us to the airport because he had to bring his sister there. i really would love to stay there the next time i go to istanbul because i think if you go to the 30 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac room you get a lot for that small money. the only thing is that maybe next time i don't want to stay in sultanahmet (the touristic center of istanbul) becuase it i very nice and interesting at day time, but at night it is completely dead! maybe i prefere to go somewhere where there is some more street/nightlife and go to the touristic places at daytime and take the tram or whatevere. also in sultanahmet everything is touristic!!! all the restaurants, everything! that means that it is very expensive and you will not find nice coffes (after the breakfast with horrible nescafe i couldn't find a nice place for my first good coffee, which was not absurdly expensive), bars etc. still thank you eniz for the good time. and see you next time i visit istanbul! ah, i forgot: the beds are VERY comfortable. and the terrace has a nice view!", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCome as a custumer, leave as a friend!\u201d", "Author": "Marc177", "ReviewID": "UR120074293", "Content": "Located in Sultanahmet, in the heart of Istanbul, l'Hotel Antique is a small hotel with big capacities.

One of the beds was broken, so it was on an extreme slant. Once again, not really a problem for me as I had the other. I was in one of the basement rooms. This meant that outside my window I had a decent amount of noise at night/early morning. There were no real blinds, so privacy was little and the sun was very much. The bathroom was small... no problem. However, the sink was extremely leaky and soaked everything even when only running it for a second. This is a hotel, not a hostel. Prices reflect the difference. However, even elements such as breakfast were slightly sub-par. I had several friends staying at a hostel in the area. I was able to see the breakfast provided to them, and it was much more impressive, despite them paying a fraction of what I was.

There's a tram stop a short walk away too, for going further afield. For eating later, there are many good cheap eateries in this area, our favourites were Doy Doy and Tamara, which both had veggie options. Unexpected bonuses included our own little balcony, complete with a rock dove that sat on the lamp and cooed to us in the morning. For this you need room 10 (but don't book it when we want it next). And the free car to and from Ataturk airport saved a lot of messing around - this is offered if you stay a week or more. What might put you off? The room was small, and sparsely furnished. Our bathroom was tiny, and although mostly there was plenty of hot water, occasionally it vanished completely. Enis was very apologetic and hopefully will get this sorted out. The spiral steps are a bit steep, if you're not very mobile this might be a problem. We would be happy to stay here again.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA good base for exploring Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "MabsLondon", "ReviewID": "UR62091651", "Content": "Rooms are a little smalll but it is an excellent base for exploring the old part of Istanbul.

I'll perhaps address a few of the other readers concerns that I came across along with my personal opinion of Hotel Antique: -Location was amazing - literally a 3 minute walk to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, couldn't ask for anything better -Service was incredible - the owners were extremely helpful in all requests and inquiries, transportation to and from the airport was organized as well which was a huge help. The breakfast provided was great and the atmosphere/view overlooking the sea from the terrace was breathtaking. -Somewhat small rooms - yes, the rooms were small in comparison to more commercial hotels, but if you're looking for character and a more unique experience Hotel Antique was perfect. -Some previous readers were concerned with the fact that the breakfast wasn't in the same building as their room? Yes - there were two separate locations with rooms...however they were all of a 10 second walk between each other. No different from walking the length of a larger hotel...except it was better since it was outside! So this should not even be considered a factor in my mind - if you're that upset that you have to walk outside for 15 seconds, I'm not sure what you're doing traveling in the first place. -No elevators - correct, there are no elevators and the stairwell is relatively narrow. If you have limited mobility or trouble with stairs this probably isn't the place for you -My only real concern was that the walls were paper thin. It wasn't the other guests that were making noise, but one of the nights I was staying, what sounded like a massive party going on nearby outside was occurring, and was very noisy and disruptive while i was trying to sleep. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for others, especially considering the price, location, breakfast, and service from the owners. While it isn't the newest of buildings with slightly undersized rooms, I was more than satisfied with my stay at Hotel Antique and hopefully if/when I return, chances are I'll be heading back here!", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach", "Title": "\u201cA nice place for small money!\u201d", "Author": "Trabzon61", "ReviewID": "UR46964129", "Content": "The rooms of this hotel are small, but for the price it is more than just good !!!
