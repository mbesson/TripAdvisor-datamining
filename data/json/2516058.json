I would suggest that if you don't mind paying a bit extra, to book their signature cabana rooms. My partner is bit of a light sleeper, so we decided to go with the cabana (garden), otherwise I would have personally opted for a balcony/poolside cabana, as it is in the centre of all the party/action (esp. during the weekends). Nevertheless, our room was nicely furnished - modern and pretty chic - and also a balcony that overlooked the garden/courtyard. The only downside was the bathroom, which was on the small side. In terms of food and drinks, the burgers and fries were great at 25 Degrees, and the Library Bar - which is situated in the classic lobby - served decent drinks. Unfortunately, we did not really spend too much time at the Tropicana bar, as we were out exploring most of the time. On the one night that we decided to stay in and visit the bar, they had a private function - so unfortunately it was closed off.

I arrived in the middle of the night and wanted to go to sleep right away. But my room was a continuation of the trip upstairs: Dirty, filthy carpet, wrecked furniture, hair in the bathroom. Back to the reception -> new room. I was accompanied by one of the staff up to make sure that this room would meet my expectations. I had to work hard not to lough when he explained to me that the \"edgy\" atmosphere of the place was all part of its charm. Anyway, new room, new luck. It was late and wanted to go to sleep. When I went to bed I noticed a large stain on the bed sheet. As I was extremely tired and already half asleep I put a towel over that and tried to sleep - back to the front desk in the morning. New room, new luck: I was apparantly upgraded to a (way) larger room. But larger does not mean better in the Roosevelt's case. Same filthy carpet, stains on the curtains, desk chair in horrible shape, hair in the bathroom. At the same time a friend of mine was staying there as well and had pretty much the same experience. Sick of moving I was finally given a discount on my rate which was OK. For the kind of money the Roosevelt charges I expect a lot more. Other things I'd like to point out: - As some others said previously, one of the only elevators was broke (which means 50% of the hotel's capacity, as there only are 2 elevators). Usually those get fixed within a couple of hours. Here, however, it was dead for the time of my entire trip. I guess everyone can imagine what it means to have only 1 working elevator in a hotel of this size. - The A/C is about as loud as a jet engine. I was glad I stayed there in January and could turn it off without sweating my [--] off. - Parking is extremely expensive. Park in the garage across the street instead, it is $10 cheaper. - Wifi costs extra (I got a refund for it due to the room quality) On a positive note: The staff were always helpful and friendly, and the location is great. To sum it up: I would not stay there again. There are plenty of other hotels in the area that offer more quality at the same/similar price. You can do better than that, Roosevelt Hotel.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and great IF you are going for a party atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "krawimi", "ReviewID": "UR123625391", "Content": "Negatives: Nearly every hotel on TripAvisor has some reviews that complain about noise.

It is super trendy, and in a good location but the rooms were a little dated, and the staff was kind of pretentious. For some reason I was on the party floor and was woken up quite often to the sounds of dance parties going on next door. That wasn't such a big deal - as I had somewhat expected it from this hotel. If it wasn't for an incident that happened in the Lobby of my last night in the Hotel I would have rated this Hotel about a 3 - 3.5. My last night staying at the Roosevelt I went to dinner in Santa Monica. Upon my return (around 10pm) The lobby and bars were crowded with people drinking and hanging out. I noticed a strange man hanging out by the elevators and was a little nervous to get on. I walked around the lobby a bit to see if he would leave but he didn't. Finally, I decided he had been sitting there for awhile (at the time I thought maybe he was waiting for someone) so I went ahead and waited for my elevator. As soon as I got on the elevator (which requires your room key to use in the evening) this man jumps up from his seat and comes running into the elevator with me. In a panic I started to run off of the elevator - he then tried to grab my arm and pull me back in. Luckily I got off the elevator and alerted security. They didn't seem to take it too seriously, but clearly this man was NOT a guest at the Hotel, and had some sort of ulterior motive for trying to get upstairs to the hotel rooms.

After reading more recent reviews of the hotel I was alert to the many complaints and chose to complain up front and be quite ascertive that this was NOT the room I had booked and paid for.

Water leaked everywhere and whenever anyone had a shower we ended up with a great puddle of water on the bathroom floor. The shower tap was a 'mixer', but you could only adjust the temperature - the hotter the water the stronger the pressure, you could not reduce the pressure without lowering the temperature. There was also very little space to put any toiletries, and with a family of four, we only had room only for our toothbrushes. Also, there was no window or exhaust fan in the bathroom.

My room on the 4th floor was quite shocking when I walked in. The carpet was spotty and filthy, absolutely no bathroom counter but the worse - a very large ring around the bathtub! The furniture was in dire need of replacement, the shower door did a very poor job of keeping water off the floor, as a matter of fact I needed to call the maid to bring more towels just so I could mop up the floor. Thankfully the bed was clean and comfortable. The party noise could be heard in my 4th floor room and ended promptly at 2 am. Shampoo & conditioner provided, no lotion or shower gel, things that I would expect from a hotel of this caliber.

We chose the hotel for its location opposite the Kodak Theatre as we were doing the full \"tourist\" Hollywood experience, the tackier the better. The hotel exudes history, being the site for the first Oscars ceremony, and had apparently been refurbished recently, although our rooms showed a fair amount of wear and tear. The outdoor pool area was used on two evenings for private parties when we were there - as our rooms were almost directly above the pool, this meant a couple of nights of not being able to get to sleep much before 3am - a better option may have been rooms fronting onto Hollywood Boulevard, although this would probably have been no quieter. (Next time, we will just have to go without the kids and join in all the fun). The large galleried central space on the ground floor is a fantastic spot to sit late at night and watch the beautiful people and wannabes go by, and we ate a couple of times in the main restaurant in the hotel - Public Kitchen - the food was good and the service the best we found in the hotel. The service at the front desk, lobby bar area, valet parking was mixed at best, and was terrible at the pool, leaving the impression that the staff had better things that they would rather be doing. We had recently been at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, so were perhaps feeling a little spoiled, but the Roosevelt's customer services manager should book a few days at the Bellagio to see how it should be done. The Roosevelt is not cheap and not really that suitable for anyone under 21. Would I go back ? Maybe.

Her birthday came and went and when we followed up whether anything had been delivered, we were told 'no'. We followed this up with the people who'd sent the package and they advised that it was delivered the day before my friend's birthday. When my friend went to the front desk to investigate the girl looked surprised and said 'oh it arrived just today, sorry.\" Err, no!

The decor is more ignorant of style than minimalist. From the dark lobby & hallways to the huge creepy over-sized male head-shot photo (covered in greasy fingerprints) looking down at the beds. We suspected room 506 was once a true crime scene. My cousin guessed someone was murdered in front of her bed and someone had their throat cut in front of mine since the (beyond) filthy carpet was patched in two places with squares of now frayed and filthy carpet pieces.

When requested, housekeeping did supply 2 additional top sheets for ME to put on the beds. Don't expect turndown service when traveling in Mexico. Oh wait.... The bathroom was the most bizarre and dated I have ever seen. Hopefully you do not have a slip & fall in the bathroom. No handrails anywhere and if you fell, no one could ever get the door open to help. I believe the tiny toilet was taken from a demolished kindergarten to fit into the tiny bathroom. Because the toilets were designed for small children, the surrounding cement walls and floor were splashed with what appeared to be urine. If sitting on the toilet & someone tries to open the bathroom door, the door will hit you in the thigh just above the knee. Tub and shower are very dated and poorly designed. First 1/2 of the tub/shower is enclosed in permanent glass leaving the 2nd 1/2 open. This causes a flood on the floor when showering. At least it cleans the floor in front of the sink.

I booked the studio king suite and it was very nice. The photos on the website don't really do it justice but it was spacious. There was a room separator in the middle of the space and the living room area was very comfortable for 13 people to come back to in order to have some dessert and hang out. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was quite large as well with a separate shower and tub. Only complaint about the bathroom was that there were a number of black scuffs on the floor, presumably from people's shoes. It wasn't exactly dirty, but at a glance it looked that way. This didn't come as a surprise but worth noting - we did get some street noise but I live in a city and that didn't bother me. This hotel is in the heart of Hollywood. I could see Grauman's Chinese Theater from my room. More bothersome than the noise was that it was very bright - but that was easily remedied with the blackout shades.

Hotel inside has that Spanish-Moroccan decor with tiles/furniture and the grand chandelier.....very well decorated. So over all more Cons than Pros for this place. Pros: -in the heart of Hollywood, right across from Chinese and Kodak theatre. -Game room, where you can rent free games/bowel on 2 lanes with assortment of cocktails and beer, very cool. Cons: -Price: Paid premium price for a small room and tiny bathroom!! -No Free Wifi. -Breakfast vouchers: continental breakfast only.....we ended paying for our own breakfast. -Loud: Heard the echos of Teddy's the nightclub below at night along with various sounds coming through the walls at night.

You can FEEL her presence still there if you are open to that. The enormous lobby with the Hollywood lounge areas and little private spots everywhere were incredible to find! Just walking and walking around the place kept showing more discoveries. I know I did not even begin to see it all, but that means there is more for me when I go back. I will return. Even the reception area is beautiful. It smells so fresh and wonderful. Staff is super friendly and I like how they dress. The automatic doors to the pool area made us feel like the superstar that we all are. Oh, and don't even get me started on the pool area! What a magical place to be at night! Little white lights, happy fires dancing in the fire pits, pool lights in the exquisitely artistic pool, people enjoying drinks from the Tropicana bar and lively music, poolside rooms lit up with people in and out of them, I felt like this was the only place to be in Hollywood. But then again on another night the club inside (Teddy's) was that spot! 25 Degrees, the restaurant, had the BEST food! Let me recommend the tomato soup and grilled cheese! It is a giant sandwich! Oh, and the french fries! Large amount and they are seasoned with thyme. Amazing taste! Get a malt, too! So so so good!! The gym was perfect too! With plenty of cardio equipment and weights, it was a wonderful way to start the day. The stairs, the doors, the walls, the paintings, the furniture, all were exceptionally decorated, and we felt like we were on a movie set of old Hollywood.

As soon as you walk out of the hotel your on the hollywood walk of fame and everything that you need is within walking distance. Everyone was really helpful and polite and it made our stay the best. A lady at reception called Millie helped us when we arrived and also changed our check out time til later as we had a late flight.

The pool was clean with staff changing the sun beds and giving out clean towels. The service around the pool was slow but not too bad overall.

It was driven by a man called Gary who we absolutely loved!! He pointed out places and things to do along our journey, chatted and laughed with us and we really enjoyed his company. We used him on the way back to the hotel too, he got there as quick as he could and took us safely, we couldn't fault him at all. We tried out the 25 degrees bar that people recommended. We enjoyed the waffles with strawberries and bananas in particular for breakfast which were amazing, and the burgers were lovely too. However we thought the prices were quite expensive as the portion sizes were quite small. We recommend that you visit universal studios as it was amazing to see where movies and TV shows were filmed, and definitely go on the studio tour it doesn't cost anything and its definitely worth going. Its one metro stop from Hollywood and a shuttle service for free takes you to the studio. You will need a lot of money to go out to America! But every second was totally worth it.

Here is a list of what you can expect from this hotel: 1. Dirty rooms with hair pieces from previous guests. 2. If you ask for extra towels, shampoo, conditioner, or ask to have your room cleaned., etc. expect that you will not receive the service for a minimum of 4 hours even after calling the front desk continuously. They do not care about their guests, I know this from personal experience and other guests who have stayed here before. 3. There are other guests who smoke weed in their rooms at this hotel, if you call the front desk to report about this, trust me they don't do anything about it. Don't think that just because you have a non-smoking room that you won't have to deal with the smoke from the room next to you. 4. Two managers to watch out for, Julius and Don [--]. If you have to deal with these two people, expect nothing out of it, and I mean not even an apology for any issues caused by the hotel. The only manager who is kind and very polite is named Kareem who comped our room for the inconvenience. 5. Beware, if you complain about your stay at this hotel, they will refuse service to you for future stays. As it is their right to do so. HOWEVER, If you complain numerous times about a situation they ignored to rectify, they will threaten to have you arrested for trespassing the next time you come to their hotel. If you ask them why, they will tell you they don't have to explain why. 6. I have personally called corporate Thompson Hotels to explain to them the situation that occurred. All they did was relay the message to the GM at Roosevelt whom did nothing but reiterate the same message I heard when I first complained about my stay. \"Do not come to this hotel, go somewhere else\" - Don [--]. Trust me, that is verbatim, not to mention he also raised his voice on me after I told him I would make sure not recommend this hotel to anyone and that I would write a review about my stay and experience with them. After saying this, Don [--] threatened to have my comments on review websites to be removed and to have a reply review about me personally!!! Can you believe how the hotel's general manager talks to a customer. Like I said, I have NEVER been to a hotel that treat their customers in such a manner. I personally don't write reviews about any hotels, good or bad. BUT this hotel and my experience with them needed to be posted. As you can see, I am beyond frustrated with the ways this hotel has treated me. I would hate for anyone else to go through the same issues that I have gone through. Save your money, this hotel is way over priced too. If you are in this area and want to experience your stay at a real luxury hotel, try the \"W Hollywood\" , \"Renaissance Hollywood Hotel & Spa\" or \"The Rebury\".

Taxi\u2019s were pretty cheap to get around in and there is a train station across the road (5 min walk) and its only $2. The hotel staff where brilliant from the bell boys to the check in staff. When we first checked in we were given a small room, for 10 nights it was too small so we went down stairs to reception and they gave me and my friend a bigger room straight away with no extra charge and had the bell boys move all are suitcases for us. The room was really nice (in the main tower) and the maid service was excellent, few stains on the carpet and the wardrobe smelt of feet but it is an old building (only complaint i have about the hotel). There is also a live TV channel that shows you Hollywood blvd . Rooms come with coffee making machine, fridge/mini bar and iron and ironing board which came in handy. When i was staying there is was $15 for 24hours of internet but if you just want to look at something for a few minutes there is free wifi at Mcdonalds which is 5 minutes up the road and i didn\u2019t even buy anything to use it. I didn\u2019t rent a car while i was in the USA but the parking prices were very high at the hotel, there is a multi storey car park next to the hotel i don\u2019t know if that was any cheaper. I ordered room service while I was there food was nice, came quickly and the portions were very generous. I also ate at 25 degree\u2019s the burgers were amazing and its open 24/7. The night life in the hotel is really good very busy at the weekends and few days in the week . The pool area is really nice, in the week I would get there before 11am or you won\u2019t get a sun bed and at the weekend the locals go to the pool so you would have to be there by 9am to get a sun bed it gets full pretty quick also towels are provided. The staff by the pool where great, service was brilliant bit slower at the weekend but that was just because it was busier.

I told my husband I wanted to stay in haunted hotels in Southern California. Supposedly the Roosevelt Hotel is one of the \u201cmost haunted hotels in Hollywood\u201d. In our research, we read there was a mirror on display in the lobby---the one that used to hang in Marilyn Monroe\u2019s room.

One good thing about this place is its location\u2026you\u2019re right in the middle of all of the touristy action of Hollywood. The Roosevelt was originally decorated in a Spanish Style but unfortunately it was remodeled in 2005 and looks as though they stripped most of the old grandeur one would expect to see. You can see in the hallways they carpeted over saltillo tiles. Our first suite was decorated in a modern style\u2014it reminded me of a 1980\u2019s bachelor pad. It had two bathrooms a living room with wooden \u2018screen\u2019 hanging from the ceiling separating it from the bedroom. The walls are paper-thin. The night we stayed there happened to be the same night of the premiere and parties for \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels\u201d. The young folks in the room next to us were up ALL night talking, leaving the room\u2014slamming the door, returning and continued talking. I understand the Hotel has no control of what their guests do in their rooms, but perhaps when they were remodeling, they could have installed thicker drywall. The next morning we told the front desk about our noisy neighbors, they gave us a blank look and begrudgingly gave us a new room. The second suite we were given was decorated in the same dismal fashion as the first one; but it had only one bathroom and quieter \u2018neighbors\u2019.

First of all, you can't beat the location. It is on Hollywood Blvd across from Madam Tussaud's/Grauman's Chinese Theater/Kodak Theater. The subway is a 2 minute walk (and then it was one stop to Universal), the Hollywood and Highland shopping area is two short blocks away and there is a public bus stop right in front of the hotel (for Santa Monica and Venice beaches, the Beverly Center/Grove shopping malls etc). There were two designer shoe warehouses (one on Hollywood, one down Orange Drive on Sunset) and I spent hours there. There is also a CVS right across the road. The elegant glazed tiles on the lobby floor and stairs spoke of another era and there are lovely indoor fountains. The rooms could use a bit of renovation (but the furniture and furnishings were definitely not tired) and the bathroom was very small, but everything was clean and comfortable and we loved the minimalist black/white/chrome look. The pool and Tropicana bar were amazing, if a bit crowded. This is a very 'happening' hotel and the common areas were noisy over the weekend. But we heard not a peep from our room. The front desk staff was very efficient and accommodating (especially Jeanie/Jenny?) and the concierge was very knowledgeable but housekeeping kept forgetting to leave toiletries/bathmat. However, calls to the front desk remedied the matter instantly. We also didn't get a turn-down service or chocolates, but it wasn\u2019t worth complaining about.

Therefore, we did not know the code to put the bolt in so we could use it. After getting back around 11:30 PM, we showered and went to bed. Your clubs were in full gear and the bass sound was thumping VERY loudly in the room. We closed the windows and still not only heard the bass to music but felt it also.

So when we gave our names, we were asked to hold on for a moment and the gentleman went out the back and he returned with another gentleman named Albert, who stated he would be showing us to our room. This was fantastic! When we got to the room, it had been upgraded and was right on Hollywood Bvld, and we could see right down H'wood Bvld to the Chinese theater etc and even could see the Hollywood sign! Albert advised us if we require any help, contact him or the front desk directly and they will do their best to help with whatever we needed. Albert also said, whatever we needed included bookings into Hard to get to restaurants, clubs, bars anything! Not longer than 30minutes later we had a knock on the door and there was a bottle of champers and a great little fruit platter!! We Dived into it and thought, THIS IS LIVING!!

We ogled the Elvis, Johnny Depp (\"Pirates\"), Marilyn and Darth impersonators who, catty-corner from the hotel, stroll and pose near the handprints and autographs of real-life stars immortalized in cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theater, which is still the site of film premiers. The Hollywood Roosevelt is a star itself from the 1920s, having hosted the first Academy Awards in 1929. The Roosevelt's restored period elegance is obvious in a walk through the lobby, complete with gurgling fountain and interior balconies that overlook a polished tile floor. Maybe Valentino didn't tango here but the ghosts of Marilyn Monroe and her sometime costar and good friend, Montgomery Cliff, reputedly haunt the floors. Step outdoors to the pool and the style is glitzy 1950s Vegas cool. No Frank, Dino or Sammy, but martinis punctuated with olives seem as popular as margaritas. Today's cool is evident in the lines of twenty-something fashionistas that form early on weekends to enter the ground floor nightclub. Hungry? Just steps away, dig into the huge, juicy burgers at 25 Degrees, a coffee shop. Bring your appetite, and your wallet. The burgers start at $8 -- but they're messy, filling and worth it. Head to the main dining room off the lobby when you're ready for candlelight, wine and a gourmet quality meal -- we recommend the lamb. When we retired to our room, we appreciated the less-is-more silver and black furnishings, desktop bar and comfortable bed. The sheets were turned down for us, and, to my wife's delight, a pair of dark chocolate squares wrapped in foil beckoned on the end table.

On many occasions during our short time at the hotel, the staff went out of there way to ensure we had the most enjoyable experience possible. One gentleman in particular was Albert Sousa, the ambassador of guest relations. I can't begin to describe how helpful Albert was, and the lasting impression he made on us. Although the hotel pool party was extremely crowded and bustling, he made us feel as if we were the only people at the pool. He continuously went out of his way to ensure that we had a memorable time in Los Angeles. The following day he personally aided us in extending our stay at The Roosevelt, and also offered advice on exciting attractions to visit near the hotel.

Also we were surprised that there was a coffee maker in the room - but the coffee wasn't included in the room price. Premises & service - The historical lobby and other premises are truly magnificent. The downside of an old hotel is that there's too few elevators and they are extremely slow. Not once did we get an elevator without waiting. The staff is very attentive although the service in a big hotel like Roosevelt can never be very individual. Restaurants - 25 Degrees is a must. Their burgers are enough to keep you running around LA for all day. Parking - $30 for valet parking, and there's no self-service parking. You get to the parking lot from N Orange Dr. Location - The best you can get from Hollywood. The subway station nearby is convenient, although subway in LA isn't that wide.

This was the last hotel/location before heading back to the UK and we were both really excited to be staying in one of the most historically reknowned hotels in Hollywood. We arrived late on a Saturday night (busiest night of the week) and the male receptionist was more interested in the so called 'talent' than in helping late arrivals. We had booked a twin room for four nights. However when we arrived we were told that there were NO twin rooms available meaning my father and I would have to share a double bed for one night. The following nights they promised to move us. Tired and with no where to go, we had to go with this option. Then came the issue with the 'refundable' charge on the room in case of incidentals. In most, or all of our hotels on this two month trip, the charge was for approx \u00a3200 per hotel room, per stay. However, the receptionist stated we would be charged the full amount of the stay. Handing over our credit card (which was clear may i add!) they stated they could not charge the full amount as it had been rejected. Trying to explain to the receptionist that we would pay in full at the start of the trip with a \u00a3200 or there abouts charge on the card, was the hardest thing. He didnt quite understand what i meant and again was more interested in looking at the young girls walking through reception than getting us to a room. I mean if someone offers to pay in full at the start of a stay at a hotel, surely this would be ideal. At now, 12.30pm, extremely tired after a flight from New Zealand we were facing a night....in a doorway! Frustrated and annoyed the receptionst finally put this through but not without making me feel like i'd robbed the place. After a night sharing a room and bed with my dad, we made our way to reception to ask to be moved, only to be told to 'come back at 3pm'. Breaking our day trip short and returning at 3pm, we were given new keys to a room and told a concierge would transfer our luggage to the new room. After an hour wasted, watching the car park below (even though we were promised a view of Hollywood Strip and the Chinese Theatre, at this point id given up arguing and just wanted a room!), i went back to reception to ask where our bags were, only to discover they had lost them!!!!!! Seriously?!?! another hour wasted and our bags arrived after looking like they had been pulled through a hedge backwards. On our departure, we did try to explain our 'experience' to the new female receptionist only to be told they werent interested.

Little did we know that the hotel lobby is constantly having private parties and events with bands and dj's blasting music. This went on every night we were there until 2 in the morning. The hotel is so old so you can hear the music very clearly from your room and it made it impossible to get a good nights sleep. After the price of the hotel and all of the fee's, a good nights sleep should have been guaranteed! The room was clean but it was no bigger than a walk in-closet. And I almost forgot to mention the bright spot lights that are aimed directly in the guests room windows. They need to make sure people see there hotel from the street even if that means annoying there paying customers with giant, bright spot lights shining through the window at night. I will never stay here again, and I recommend the anyone thinking of staying here go somewhere else.

The hotel itself is actually lovely, nice pool, restaurants and very clean. However, the rooms were unbelievably small. Although we booked a twin room they initally placed us in a double, meaning we would have to share a rather small double bed. After a lot of complaining with the manager they eventually agreed to move us to a twin room. It wasn't much better. There may have been two beds but they were so close it may aswell have been one. The room was bare with no character and if you want to watch any tv it all has to be paid for, even news channels etc The bathroom was like a closet with no room to move. The Library bar was extremely pricey at around $20 per drink where they create a cocktail to your taste, especially when you can go to the normal bar and have champagne cocktails for $12. The newly opened restaurant was actually the nicest thing about the hotel. A little pricey but the food is delicious so worth the price and the staff were really helpful. Which makes a change from the other staff in the hotel who were quite frankly rude and unhelpful. 25 degrees is also a nice cafe type place to eat in the hotel. It's very reasonably priced and the portions are enormous and the staff here were lovely. In fact all the waiters and waitresses were lovely in the hotel, it was the bar staff and general staff who were incredibly rude and it's a shame they are spoiling the reviews for the rest of the staff. The valet staff were much better and can call a taxi to arrive in seconds. However, every time we got a taxi from the hotel we were ripped off by the drivers, one took a very scenic route to universal studios making the price double than the journey home. On another occasion the driver dropped us off 2 miles from the restaurant we asked! Can't blame the hotel for that but the drivers obviously expect rich guests and take advantage. The hotel is in a great location, right on the walk of fame and next to the kodak theatre. As it's such a big place no hotel will be perfect for every place you want to visit, but this hotel is certainly pretty close. Overall I was quite disappointed with the hotel. Having travelled here straight from the Bellagio in Vegas it was quite a demotion. It seems to be living off it's famous past time and quite frankly has lost its appeal.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cHOLLYWOOD AT ITS BEST\u201d", "Author": "effieandyannis", "ReviewID": "UR109694133", "Content": "If you want to explore Hollywood and wanna do it in style then the Roosevelt is the place to stay.

Our room was terrible - very small with one of the worst beds I have ever slept on in my life. The room was so small and oddly laid out that manuevering around was tough and you were lucky to open drawers without hitting another piece of furniture. On top of that; our \"queen\" room looked to be more of a double bed (we tried to verify but could not find a mattress tag). The bathroom had some stupid half door on the shower that did not seal properly at the bottom and got water all over the floor. The toilet was so close to the sink that when you sat down your face was hanging over the sink. When we asked the front desk (which is now down in a basement room as the lavish original lobby has been converted to a bar and restaurant... go figure) if we could switch hoping that maybe we just had a lemon they told us it would be $50 A NIGHT to switch to the same room! We ended up just leaving a night early of our prepaid stay and used hotel points somewhere else. Everyone we encountered except for the bartenders at Public were rude and could care less. The valets were just as bad - we were pressed for time to get to dinner one night so we called down 25 min before we left to make sure the car was ready. It was not and it took them an additional 10 minutes to pull it around once we got down there! This was a recurring theme with the valets throughout our stay - 4 of them standing around while you wait 20 minutes for your car. On top of the bad service it was $30 a day for parking!

Much of what has been said about the Roosevelt is indeed true. It is dark, and does have a dreary vibe to it, however this adds to the character of the hotel. The modern and simplistic furnishings and decor (or minimalistic, as Thompson refers to it) not only complement the hotel's character, but adds to it. It's location is second to none, lying at the very heart of Hollywood Blvd, where all of the action lies. It's facilities, namely the pool area, mostly live up to the unprecedented standards and experienced by many, and further add to its appeal. The Roosevelt positions itself as a modern, vibrant establishment, however it is let down significantly by a few key points, most of which are exclusive to my particular case. I'd looked into many Hollywood accommodation options prior to making my reservation, and picked the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel based on the above aspects. My booking was via an external agent, and originally a superior king room was reserved for me, with a complimentary upgrade upon checkin. I was required to cancel this reservation and book again, but this time without the complimentary upgrade. I contacted the hotel directly in order to request a high floor, exactly as I had done with my original reservation, and was informed that a note was attached to my reservation requesting so, and that they had also added a note requesting the complimentary upgrade. On arrival, I was allocated a superior king room on the fifth floor, overlooking a rooftop. Although it was always understood that my requests were requests, and not guaranteed, it remained a considerable disappointment for me, however being so jet lagged and lethargic after such a long, sleepless night, I decided not to pursue it. Further, I decided to sleep with earplugs in, due to the erratic and disturbingly loud sound of the air conditioning system, and was able to sleep for a matter of hours until my neighbours arrived back to their room at 1:30am. I could literally hear every word of their conversation, as though they were conversing in my presence, regardless of the fact that I had earplugs in! They were not shouting, screaming, laughing or yelling; it was a conversation that I could hear as clear as day. This was yet another disappointment. The bathrooms, although uniquely decorated, are quite small, and would be to few people's taste. It is for these reasons that I will not choose to stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel again in future. Without its appeal and historical existence, in addition to the friendly staff, this establishment would have suffered the same fate as so many of its counterparts before it, and simply have been a forgotten memory. I didn't have too many expectations in regards to this hotel; it's just a shame that of the few I would have appreciated, I received very little in return.

And all of this continues to evolve & improve over time. After 10 years on the road, I'm convinced that you will not find a cooler, more fun, better managed, better staffed, more diverse, and ultimately better value hotel. I travel a lot (over 150 days per year) and am lucky to stay at high-end hotels everywhere I go. I'm extremely picky about the hotels I select and have very high expectations. I've stayed at all of the higher-end/trendy hotels in LA (both W Hotels, the SLS, the Four Seasons, the Fairmont, Chateau Marmont, the Viceroy, the Standard, the Beverly Hilton, etc, etc.)...the Roosevelt continues to be the best and the only place I ever want to stay. The property itself is gorgeous (a historic hotel with the elegance of old Hollywood....but beautifully upgraded with a modern/hip style). There are many different rooms and suites so you can always find something that fits the occasion. The location is also great...right in the middle of Hollywood but central to everything else you'd want to do in LA (except the beach which is about 30 mins away). The venues at the Roosevelt are all Sure Bets...you can't go wrong with any of them. There's the Tropicana lounge out by the pool (a fun time catching some sun during the day or after dark when it turns into a hip outdoor lounge under the stars), the Library Bar (a unique place for special drinks), the Lobby Lounge (beautiful area with painted ceilings and a fountain...nice plush couches for sitting with your date or friends/colleagues), Teddy's (intimate venue and one of the hot nightlife spots in Hollywood), 25 Degrees (a gourmet burger bar with the best burgers in LA...and open 24 hours a day). Public (a new high-end restaurant with excellent food) just opened. The Spare Room (exclusive modern-day gaming lounge & bar..includes 2 bowling lanes) and Beacher's Madhouse (amazingly fun & unique experience...unlike anything you've ever seen....you'll want to go back for more) also just opened. The staff is friendly and truly exceptional...they go above & beyond to provide outstanding service. They also do a great job balancing a professional/respectful approach while making you feel comfortable & welcome. The hotel has many celebrity, VIP, and demanding guests...and the team at the Roosevelt has a great knack for making/keeping their customers happy.

I've been extremely impressed by all the teams at the hotel including Reservations, In-Room Dinning, Housekeeping, Front Desk, Bell & Front Drive Staff. Ingrid (who runs the Front Office), and Mark (who runs the Bell Staff & Front Drive) are on top of their game and some of the best in the hospitality industry.

I liked the room, it almost felt like I was in a cabana because when you open the sliding door you can hear the vibrant music from the pool and tropicana bar. The only dissapointment was there was no coffee in my room. The bathroom was a little small with very little counterspace and dark lighting. The hotel is known for having a few ghosts. In our room one night, the radio turned on by itself, twice. Don't know if there was a loose wire or if it was a ghost playing with us. Had breakfast at 25 degrees, the food was good, we both had omelettes at $12.00 per meal. I was dissapointed in the service, the waiter looked like he needed sleep and a shower. He wasn't friendly nor did he come around to offer more refills. I recommend staying here, the hotel was clean, the staff was courteous and it's in a great location where all the action is.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "toinfinity", "ReviewID": "UR103993541", "Content": "we had a short but enjoyable stay. great possition, great room, Love LA & Love the Roosevelt though not the cheapest hotel.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "KylieandAaron", "ReviewID": "UR103713900", "Content": "We arrived at the Hollywood Roosevelt and were sent to our room.

My husband and I were very excited to see the room they put us in especially because the lobby is very nice. That excitement quickly ended opening our room\u2019s door. The room badly needed to be refurbished, old carpet, base boards scratched, the bathroom was small and I found a pubic hair on the toilet. It was such a disappointment my husband and I decided to go downstairs to one of their restaurants just to leave the room and ask if we could be moved to another room. Again, the staff was very friendly and gave us a different room with an upgrade. This is where the fun started, we moved our stuff to the better/larger room with the better view. Same thing, the room needed to be refurbished and the bathroom was the same size as the smaller room. Entering the room we noticed the room had fruit in it welcoming a \"Mr. Hodges\" and we looked to our left and spotted a roach on the wall. We call down to the friendly staff and to send someone up to collect the fruit because who wants the fruit when you see a roach nearby. The person that picked up the fruit didn't get rid of the roach they were sending someone else up for that which took too long so my husband got rid of the roach himself. When the guy finally arrived he had a can of Raid with him, I'm glad my husband threw the roach out the window then have our room sprayed with Raid. I guess the small bathrooms are to be expected with such an old hotel but they can spend the money to update the room or just not charge as much. Oh, and if you get a drink at there pool (where all the hot chicks go hang out and I'm a women) the drinks are 20 dollars each. On the upside the location is touristy yes but something is always going on. While we were staying there Bravo had a big event where stars came too, Penelope Cruz received her star accompied by Johnny Depp and they were filming a scene for a movie on the street.

Unfortunately that\u2019s where my good points end. I paid more to be around the pool, huge mistake. The first room I was given had a very small window, which was completely frosted and you couldn\u2019t see out of it. Once I opened it, I realized why, the room was directly on the side street next to the hotel. I went into the bathroom, the sink clogged and there were dead bugs on the floor. I went to the front desk and asked to be moved. They moved me to a room that was directly across from the back of the outside bar. Apparently something there was a large alcohol spill and the entire hallway was wet and there was a large dryer on the ground trying to dry up the mess. The entire hallway spelled like old beer. It was completely nauseating to stand in front of our door. I asked to be moved again and they told me that was the last room left in my category and I would have to pay for an upgrade. It was completely shocking to me that they would even let guests go into either room given the circumstances and you would think they would have put me into a different room without having to pay. I was only there one night so decided not to ruin the time I had by arguing with people who don\u2019t know anything about customer service. Instead, I\u2019ll try to let everyone know to not pay extra for a room by the pool and also that if you do happen to have an issue, you can either pay to make it go away or you\u2019ll regret not staying somewhere else and wasting $287/night on a room. The room also had extremely poor lighting, to the point where you can't put makeup on or read anything.

I was very skeptical because of the reviews (and when I stay at 4plus stars I expect just that) well in comparison to the other hotels I have stayed at, this one was on the same great level! The customer service was amazing! As soon as we got their, we were greeted kindly, any questions we asked they were answered, literally anything we needed they were on top of it. At one point I had ordered room service and the gentleman told me it may take about 15 minuets because they were a little busy which I didn't have a problem with. He was there in 5 minuets with hot good food. I tipped him extra just for that, and he was so very nice! The location is perfect for touring, walking around. Its within walking of the metro station. And the Beverly Center is a quick cab ride, I mean this is a really great spot. The rooms are nice and comfortable, well lit (I saw a couple comments about how it is dark in the hotel??? I didn't have an issue), beds are comfortable, we had a view of the pool. The only thing that I agree with is that the bathrooms are small, but if you don't plan on spending your vacation in the restroom this isn't a big deal. There is too much to get out and see. The hotel history is awesome and the 25 Degrees restaurant has the best grilled cheese and tomato soup I have ever had. One of my favorite vacations. The last day we were there we even accidentally walked onto a film set trying to catch our shuttle and the hotel and directors were very apologetic. We actually found it comical.

I was really impressed by the decor and how boutique the hotel was. I headed up to my room and was really pleased with the space - 2 closets, a king bed, couch/lounge area and a nice sized bathroom. The hotel location is great if you're looking for the Hollywood experience. it's central to the Chinese theater, Kodak theater and the walk of fame. You literally walk out your door and are in the middle of iconic Hollywood. The restaurants at the hotel are great. 25 degrees has good breakfast options and Public Kitchen was reasonably priced, amazing food. Highly recommended. Plus, you'll definitely see a celeb or two. The Pool bar was a hot spot and is surrounded by cabana hotel rooms. So if you're looking for a quiet night, do not get a room there. The Spare Room is the new bar that just opened on the 2nd floor.

My business colleague and I chose this place based on positive things we had heard and the great location. When we arrived, there was an odd odor (think kitty litter) in the check-in area and one of our rooms was not ready. When the rooms were finally ready, we were told we had to carry our luggage up a flight of stairs to our rooms. No elevator. No ramp. No one to help with the bags. What a first impression. When we got to our room, the front desk person said we were in the \"upgraded rooms\" by the pool. The rooms were clean but fit for someone who was there to party as the first view was large bottles of alcohol and condoms on the snack platter. Since we were there for business, we did not think this room was the best fit for us. We then left the room to have lunch by the pool. The staff was so aloof and unhelpful but we stuck it out anyway and remorsefully ate among the men ogling the topless women around the pool. This was around 1pm on a Weds. We left and went to a business meeting and returned 4 hours late to request a change of room since the music playing from the pool was so loud. The reservations person on the phone was very kind and helpful but the rooms we were put in were dark, stains on the carpet, red lights in the bathroom and you could hear the street noise as if the windows were open. It was far worse than the first room. So my colleague and I decided to leave the hotel altogether. The front desk felt a little bad that we were canceling our reservation but the parking guys insisted we pay $36 for the 45 minutes we had parked at the hotel the entire day. Shocked by the request, we handed them our credit card and said what a horrible way to treat unhappy guests at your hotel. Then the parking guys told us that their credit card machine was broken and we had to go get cash, pay the $36 and then we would get the car. We could not believe it! We refused and after a lot of back and forth, they finally let us go without paying the parking. We could not wait to get out of there!! We went to the Beverly Hills Hilton and felt like we were in heaven there after our time at the deplorable Roosevelt. On our way out, there was a couple in the elevator who told us they had changed rooms twice but were still unhappy. Oh we could relate!!

We had preconceptions about the hotel because we had read so many reviews about the place being snobby and unwelcoming unless you were a Hollywood socialite....but we found it to be quite the opposite, and ended up really enjoying our stay. While I agree that it IS pricey, considering its age and the fact that the rooms are quite minimalist, I think it was still good value. We would have had to pay the same or more to stay at the London or the W. When else are you going to get to stay in a hotel where Marilyn Monroe lived, and where the first Oscars were held? Anyway, so, we had a hire car which we drove in from LAX, found the parking very easy when....you are best to come up Sunset Blvd and turn left onto N Orange Dr instead of going all the way up to Hollywood Blvd. The valet is at the back of the hotel and not ON Hollywood Blvd. The valet were the most attentive we experienced anywhere in the US, and I honestly can't imagine they could have treated us better if we had been celebrities. I believe the parking was $35 a day, and we took our car out once or twice a day so with tips it does become expensive, but I can't see how you would do without a car in LA. We saw more expensive parking in San Fransisco though, at $45 a day. Checkin staff were extremely gracious and friendly. Our bags arrived in our room very quickly too. The room was very simple. We had the most basic room with king bed. It had a well stocked mini-bar and good in-room entertainment. We had room service from the 25 Degrees bar one night very late and it was delicious.....you have to have their sweet potato fries with blue cheese sauce....so good! Thier signature burger was really good too.....just don't be shoked at a $100 bill for a couple of burgers and fries (including tip). It was a good burger OK? We went to the pool, had no problems at all. Nobody tried to stop us or tell us it was for invited guests only. The pool area was really nice, although we didn't end up swimming because it was too cool. I can't say that it isn't compltely manic at other times when they are hosting a party, but it was fine when we were there, no issues at all. The location of the hotel had its pros and cons. If you want to check out Hollywood Blvd and do the typical tourist stuff like take a tour of stars homes, check out the Chinese Theatre and Madame Tausads then you really couldn't get a much better location. Hollywood Highlands mall is just a few minutes walk too, which gives you one of the best views of the Hollywood Sign that we saw the whole time. I personally didn't LIKE Hollywood Blvd, it was just very tacky and touristy, and at night it was very seedy. There is nothing really ON Hollywood Blvd at night, but it is very central to all the clubs. I kind of wish this Hotel had been in another neighbrhood, then it would have been pretty much perfect for our needs. We found we were sick of that area within a day. The actual hotel is just beautiful to look at, and all the bars and restaurants were really stunning. Take the time to wander around and have a look at the ground floor and see all the history of the place. It really is stunning. All in all I would return here so long as I had a car and could get out of the Hollywood Blvd vicinity regularly. The room was very clean and I loved their body products in the bathroom.

Also, not to be missed is El Capitan Theater, on the same side of the street as The Roosevelt, about 1/2 a block away. The good: we paid for a standard room, in the lower price bracket (with 2 queen beds) & were rewarded with every thing I asked for in the notes section, when reserving & received a large room overlooking Hollywood Blvd. The bathrooms are circa 1927 however, so don't expect an spa tub or as many square feet as we are used to these days. The bathrooms have been redone and are nice, but not luxurious. The linens were nice also & the beds comfy. The check in staff was excellent & Mark, the head of the valet battalion was, well remarkable & was \"on it\" as far as I could see. We did have an instance where our keys were left if in our car, unlocked, which was alarming in a neighborhood where most anything can happen & most likely does. But, it was fine in the end. Just waiting for your car, at least when we were there is a genuine Hollywood who's who experience there, so time passed quickly. They even offered the managers safe for my valuables, after we checked out & put our luggage in storage. Room service was an unexpected surprise in that the food was good, the staff in the kitchen & deliverer's quite pleasant, plus the prices were reasonable. Amazing! The not so good: the carpet in our bed chamber in room 915 was in my opinion gross. It was rippled & felt crunchy under foot & this is the first 4 * & above I've sadly had to say that about. At $300.+ a night I expect to feel I am in a luxurious space & I didn't, when it came to the overall feel of our room. The hotel has undergone renovations & the rooms are meant to have a modern feel, which they do, but unfortunately (again) the furniture looks worn & nicked and in the case of the desk chair, really bad. Plus there was no place to sit for breakfast in our big room. That was a miss on the designers part for sure. One more thing, that is in no way controllable by the hotel staff is even on the 9th floor, the noise from people on the street on Hollywood Blvd. goes on into the wee hours. If you have kids or you sleep lightly you may consider something faces away from the street or a super high floor. All in all, we enjoyed ourselves while we attended the AFI Film Fest & seeing all the red carpets being layed down everyday at Grauman's Chinese Theater, from our rooms view, was wonderful. Everything I requested we received with a smile & you cannot ask for more than that from a hotel. My husband gave it a thumbs up & if the crunchy carpet issue is resolved, I will too.

The only other thing which was annoying was the fact that when you went to bed you were woken up without fail through the night with loud music blaring from the rooms either side of you, it was clear that the people who book these rooms use them to party not to sleep, which is fine but it wears thin when it happens every night.

THe hallways are so dark and depressing, it's design is just dark and cold. The room is not warm cozy inviting or beautiful. The floors are terribly scraped and scuffed. I was in room 224 -The Bathroom is one step above a public park design with cement walls and floors, no tile? It's so ugly and industrial and it looks dirty. Everything is painted chocolate brown. The brightest place in the room is over the mini bar area with a spotlight over the over priced snacks? There is literally not enough light in the room to get dressed or put on your make up. The platform bed is comfortable, But don't plan on sleeping. The pool is beautiful but they rented it our each night I weas there for a private party, Night 1 - a private party until 2 AM a with loud DJ playing and no access to the pool or any where around it. Day 2 the pool closed for a set up for another- private party where a deck was being constructed over the pool, so- no access to the pool or area which means you have to walk twice as far to get to your room, and once again loud pounding music until 2am. Night 3 - the pool not available in the morning as they were deconstructing the pool deck! The whole weekend I felt like I was an intruder at a party. Everywhere you go there is security and check lists. Priorities are about the poolside parties at night NOT the guests. Ordered soup and a grilled chese sandwich, the sandwich was rubbery and cold by the time I got to eat it. Why promote a hotel with a pool if your guests cannot use it? That is stupid. Build a party area somewhere else ont he property or don't promote the pool. 100 degrees and the pool is used for private parties, not for guests paying for overpriced amenities you CANNOT USE!

The Roosevelt was all that and more. I don't know if you can get trendier than this in such a great location - I suppose the Standard would fit as well, but The Roosevelt is right across the road from Graumans Chinese Theatre and right on Hollywood Boulevard, therefore right on the Star Walk. There is great shopping around it, and its minutes away from most of the best clubs (by the way, definitely do SkyBar at the Mondrian, Chateau Marmont's Bar Marmont, and the Standard!!) Teddys, within the hotel itself, was probably our favourite anyway! The room we had was spacious enough and had a good bathroom - a small one, but we didnt find there was a lack of storage space - there were shelves above the toilet to store all your things, and we did our makeup etc in front of the full length mirror in the bedroom anyway. The beds were AMAZING - comfortable and the sheets were so luxurious! I got the feeling this hotel caters to people partying big at night and wanting a minimalist room that has great comfort and serenity - this is what we found. Our room faced Hollywood Boulevard but was quiet as anything. The only thing I would say is that our air conditioning unit was reasonably loud - but it was consistent noise so it didnt bother us. We found the service totally fine - staff were very friendly to us and we were let in to both the Tropicana Bar and Teddys. No rudeness or vagueness. A word of notice - Teddys is not actually affiliated with the Roosevelt apparently, so dont expect to get in because you are staying at the hotel. The crowd inside was very much Hollywood young hipster - so you need to dress up and try and look trendy to get in! I dont know if you get into Tropicana simply because you are a guest - we didnt mention it but got in anyway - the Thursday Night pool party was so fun! But I wouldnt bank on access just being a hotel guest is all - I would email them first to find out. I mention this only because prior to going, a lot of the negative reviews stated their outrage at not being allowed in to either Teddys/Tropicana even though they were guests - the thing with a lot of Hollywood hotels is their bars and clubs arent really there for the guests per se - they seemed more like stand-alone places that just happened to exist within a hotel.... I think the negative reviews are possibly because of expectations of the place. This is not really a family friendly hotel, nor is it really the place to stay if you are wanting to be waited on hand a foot (which is lovely!). I would recommend it for people who either want to party and just want to use their room as a place to sleep/get ready, but its fine for anyone happy to deal with the rare few late night partiers in the foyer (and by late, I mean 2am!) who would love a minimalist place right on Hollywood Boulevard!", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Gatos, California", "Title": "\u201cA fun vibe and wonderful service\u201d", "Author": "OCPB", "ReviewID": "UR77690677", "Content": "While recently vacationing with our teenagers, who have stayed at some of the nicest \"resort type\" hotels around, their Dad and I wanted to give them a different type of vacation experience and introduce them to more of a colorful and interesting boutique hotel for a better cultural experience.

Thankfully we didnt have a single disturbed nights sleep. The one thing I would complain about in this hotel was the service. We booked our room online through the internet and got a fab rate for a king suite. It seemed too good to be true and when we checked in it turned out it was as we were put in a standard double room. I called concierge only to be told that was what I had booked so that was what I would get. I disagreed so asked for the Manager and when he eventually showed up and I showed him my confirmation print out he had to agree that although the rate offered had been a mistake, they had to honour it and so we were moved rooms. The process to achieve this was long however and the staff seemed rather disinterested in anything related to work - they were chatting amoung themselves and less interested in the waiting guests. We also wanted to arrange transport to Disneyland so were advised to visit with the concierge. Again he was engaged with a colleague for some time before he realised we were waiting.

I booked a twin room with 2 beds for my teenage son and myself two months ahead. I booked here because of its location and the fact that it would be a great \"Hollywood\" experience for my 14yr old son for a night before going to Anaheim. I paid $320 AUD for a twin room. Upon checking in i was told i was getting a King Bed. I showed my booking confirmation that my travel agent gave me for a booking with twin beds. The receptionist Marie i think her name was, (part Aisan lady) insisted she never had a booking for twin bed despite the proof i had in my hand. The other receptionist (very long hair to her waist) although i had no dealings with her one on one, was very unfriendly to the point of rude to customers and treated everyone like they were second rate citizens. My son and i had the pleasure of observing her whilst trying to sort our issues out! My receptionist said they were fully booked and couldn't help me. I insisted it wasn't good enough and for the price i was paying and the two months notice they had of my booking, that i want what i had booked and paid for. She refused to put me in another room and said best she could do was to give me a rollaway. I stated that i had booked this accomodation given the location and the quality of the hotel and the fact it did offer two queen beds on the website. She then said well just because you booked twin bedding it doesn't mean you requested twin beds!! At this point i became very annoyed at her patronizing attitude and requested a manager to which she said she will go and talk to one. She then came back and said that there was nothing they could do for me as they were fully booked. We since found out there was Skateboarding competition on and there were a lot of single people that had booked accomodation so i suspect our booking was given away to two singles wanting 2beds. We were given a room and then were called an hour later after settling in, that the room they had given us was too small for a rollaway so we got moved to another room, even though i was told they were fully booked. We then called down to reception 4 times asking for the roll away and were told every time that is was on its way. I suspect the girl downstairs was being very unaccomodating on purpose. The rollaway finally arrived at 8.30pm 6 hrs after checking in. We had attempted to go to the pool during the day and went downstairs to find the place absolutely packed with no where to even sit down with a towel so we decided to flag it and go back to the room. The bathrooms were extremely small and you couldn't fit any more than one in the bathroom at a time. The shower leaked all over the floor and wet everything we had sitting down there. No shower caps, no extra pillows, no extra towels and only one dressing gown for a superior room with king bed. Tony the guy who bought our luggage up was very helpful. Overall it was a very bad and expensive mistake to book here and i certainly recommend that you do not make the same mistake. From someone who stays in many hotels, this hotel has only its name going for it. Since returning to Australia on Saturday i have confirmed through my travel agent and the wholesaler they used to book the accomodation that in fact the hotel did receive a booking for a twin room. But they gave it away because they reserve the right to give it away at any stage and provide you with whatever is available at the time. So be aware this happens with all hotel bookings and relies on the hotel to do the right thing and fulfill their obligations but they can in fact they don't have to. We then went on to spend 4 fantastic days at the Hyatt Regency at Anaheim who i cannot fault. Everything ran smoothly and they couldn't do enough for us.

We checked back close to 6:00 and were given the keys to our room. Once we entered the room, I noticed a bug on the bed, but didn't think twice about it. We left and went exploring over at Hollywood and Highland which was right across the street. PRO: The friendliest front desk staff BIG CON: The bug situation: we were initially not concerned, but when we kept finding the same type of bug we became alarmed. We caught one of the bugs in a glass so we could show hotel staff. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone up. A handy man came, and looked around for more bugs. He then called the supervisor of housekeeping who was very friendly. She stated that they had never had bed bugs before, and she wondered where these bugs were coming from. They offered to change our room, but not after trying to tell us that we brought the bugs with us, or it was our fault because maybe we \"left the window open, or had food around\". Neither of which were the case. Regardless, they said a bellman would be sent up in 5 minutes to help us switch rooms. If you are told a bellman is coming, you assume someone is going to bring a cart to help you with your many bags. Not the case. A man arrived about 20 minutes later with keys to the new room. He looked at our stuff and said \"Oh.... you need help with your bags?\" He carried 2 suitcases that he left in the room, but we were left lugging 3 heavy duffles and another suitcase down to our new room. The staff never apologized, or offered us anything for the inconvenience of a) wasting an entire day to \"investigate\" the bug situation and b) having to switch rooms mid-stay. Our first room was much nicer than the second room in regards to furniture and amenities. It had an iHome iPod dock radio, and a dresser, which the second room did not. CON: The first room almost the entire time smelled like marijuana. We never figured out where this was coming from, but the smell was strong enough as if someone was in our room smoking. CON: Both rooms had extremely loud air conditioners. I had to wear ear plugs to sleep, and could still hear it. CON: Security in the hotel was non-existent. You needed to enter your room key in the elevator in order to get to the guest room floors. Anyone could follow you in the elevator though, which we learned the hard way. We arrived back to the hotel relatively late one night (at approximately 2:00AM) and a man followed us into the elevator. He asked us if we wanted to smoke weed with him and have a threesome. It was scary! Being two young girls from NYC, nothing scares us, but this did. He was a creepy predator! CON: The valet was very expensive, and you weren't taken seriously unless you were driving a Beamer, Benz, or Bentley. It was almost as if we were second class citizens because we were driving a rental car. I did, although, tip the valet men EVERY TIME we exited or entered the hotel. PRO: The pool at the hotel is nice, and the bar at the pool is fun. You do need to be supermodel type though to feel comfortable laying out or swimming here. Overall our stay was OK.

It was an excellent location for what we were interested in seeing. It is literally across the street from the Kodak Theater, Graumans Chinese Theatre, Starline Tours, and Madame Tusauds. It is on the walk of fame as well. We booked a cabana room with patio. I asked for an upgrade, which they easily obliged. We got a cabana room with balcony. The room was modern rustic with hardwood floors, dim lighting and a very comfy platform bed. It overlooked the nice pool area and Tropicana bar. My gripes: We checked in at 2:15 and they said they would call me when the room was ready. I never got a call, even by 6:30p, so we went back after seeing some sites. They apologized, but this was unprofessional. $30 for valet was not fun, especially when certain valets acted like they were more like club bouncers. Tips on our end were minimal to say the least. We tried to avoid it by pulling into the parking lot next to the hotel, but the signs indicated it was not entirely public parking, so you are kinda stuck with valet if you have a car at this hotel. Although retro and cool, the lighting in the room was not the best for seeing yourself, packing etc. I need some area with a bright light. Apparently, there is a club there called Teddys that is frequented by celebs and such. We thought about going, but were too tired and heard or overheard how hard it would be to get into.. I overheard the valet saying this to some Australian guys and the guys commented that there should be some sort of courtesy given to guests. I agree. This hotel is perfect for active, partying early 20s and possibly up to hip 40 year olds. I am 33 and would take my husband or girlfriends here, but not my parents or child. There were no kids in sight, and you can expect some noise if you are by the pool and some possible disruptions of the drunk partiers in the wee hours. However, it was not extreme or anything. Also, the hall wreaked of Mary Jane on one of the nights....must of been CA's medical MJ users. We were out and about most of the day and part of the night.

Around the pool area we were asked to move several times to make way for other guests! Whatever happened to first come first serves! We are all paying guests at the hotel! 2. Small and dingy rooms. The rooms in the tower are small and dark. You can't unpack your suitcase as there is nowhere to put your clothes. The maids rarely replenished the complimentary showers gel etc! 3. The elevators were constantly out of service, in which case we were made to walk down 12 flights of stairs on more than one occasion.

For a 4 star hotel in Hollywood Boulevard, that is a bargain. The Hollywood Roosevelt in superbly located on Hollywood Boulevard, within easy access of a number of attractions (Madame Tussauds and the Chinese Theatre are literally across the road). However, in terms of the hotel itself I was a bit disappointed: the public rooms (ie the bars, reception and sitting areas) are beautifully designed and decorated, like you would expect to see in a 4 star hotel. Yet the room in which we were accommodated was quite, well ordinary - more like a 3 star hotel at best. Don't get me wrong, although it was a small room, there was no 'problem' with the room: there was a double bed, decent tv and it was clean and comfortable. I'm no snob that demands the best and an oppulent lifestyle, but I have stayed in 4 star hotels in various locations in the world and the Hollywood Roosevelt rooms frankly don't compare in my opinion. I'm not sure if when they took over, Thomson maintained the current standards of the public rooms but 'toned down' the other rooms to keep prices down and/or make it more affordable?!? Anyway, you'll understand now why I describe it as a hotel of two halves. Internet access costs $10 per 24 hours, and although there is a coffee machine in the room you have to pay for the coffee! I'm not sure if this is standard for LA hotels in prime locations but I've nearly always found such ammenities free in USA hotels. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the quality of the food but we did go to the Library Bar where the resident cocktail mixer (Matt) mixes some wonderful cocktails using locally grown produce, and at a reasonable price. The service from all staff was very good. In sum, great location for the Hollywood area. A fair bargain if you can get a good deal on the rooms instead of paying the standard price.

Warning - If you are looking for a peaceful location this is not the hotel for you. The medium sized busy pool is packed with models and wannabes and each weekend they have an all day and night pool party with very loud club music playing. It also uses all the pool side seating and beds. If you are looking for a 18-30 holiday vibe this is the spot for you. If like me, you wanted a peaceful afternoon in the sun, this is awful and something the hotel staff do not tell you about when you check in! The car park is busy at all hours, you can hear the Hollywood boulevard salesmen on their tanoys from before 9am each morning. There are also a lot of people hanging around till early in the morning, whilst they party at the hotel. The hotel is on the doorstep of the Hollywood and highland entertainment complex where you can eat, drink and shop. It is also next to the kodak and manns theatres. Best of all the hotel is next door to the la metro line. This can take you all over la (including universal theme park) for less than $2! If you are in la I would recommend the following places: 1. The grove - great brand name shops, farmers Market and the cheesecake factory restaurant (does soooo much more than cake!) 2. La star homes tour - great if you like celebrities! 3. In and out burger on sunset, just behind the hotel - famous with the celebs for the best burger in Hollywood! 4. Broadway and Dws shoe shops - next to hotel on sunset and Hollywood boulevard. Very cheap brand name shoes - bargains! 5. Universal & city walk - great day out.....go on the metro! 6. Disneyland - good, smaller version of disneyworld in Orlando 7. Santa monica - have a walk around the pier, the beach front and the 3rd street promenade 8. Malibu - paradise cove. A great spot to spend a day at a peaceful beach. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, if you go to la in June, be aware that the sun does not burn through the clouds until after lunch. Before this time, and after 5pm, it can be chilly so bring layers in your suitcase! In summary, the hotel overall was ok.

Only 2 guests from each room can go if they paid $20 per day. Not fair when you are more than 2. Had I known prior to booking that the hotel pool would be off limits I would have opted to stay elsewhere. I have heard this happening before at this hotel and I think that they should post this on their website when not all ammenities will be available to guests during their stay. I think it is unacceptable. We pay for the room expecting to be able to use all facilites that they have to offer unless they are out of order. My other compaint is that the shower leaks all over the bathroom because there is no shower curtain, but only a glass barrier that does not reach the corner walls. By the end of your shower you have a puddle of water all over. This too has been noted in other reviews on tripadvisor and I do not understand why the hotel has not bothered to fix this problem.

Check in was quick and painless. We had booked a Cabana room - garden view. The hallways are very dark and there was an odd smell which seemed to come from the bar area. The room was a good size and nicely furnished. On our first evening (Saturday night), we decided to eat in the burger bar which was very good and then we went to the Tropicana bar. I think you would either love this or hate it. If you don't like that sort of scene, I would not recommend hanging around the pool area. We had a couple of drinks (yes, it is expensive) and took ourselves off to our room. On the second evening, we went back to our room, were getting ready for bed when suddenly I became very aware of an extra guest of the cockroach variety in our room. After a comic chase around with the bin, we called down to reception. They did send someone up very quickly who asked if it was vermin (!!) and moved us to a poolside cabana. To be fair, they were very good dealing with this although I was a little traumatised! Overall, we liked the hotel - very atmospheric in the old lobby, lovely pool and cool bar area but I think you would need to consider carefully if this is the sort of thing you want. We were only in LA for 2 days so wanted something quite, well, LA! If you want this, stay here.", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "south shields tyne and wear", "Title": "\u201cavoid this hotel at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "amy1610", "ReviewID": "UR37297566", "Content": "This is by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed in not worth a dime! 1) upon arrival hotel was buzzing with underage hollywood morons taking up the space in the lobby.

The fixtures and fittings were absolutley appauling ikea could of done a better job! this room was very very noisy you could hear the noise from the nightclubs outside the revving of cars in the carpark and of course the young wannabe idiots who'd located themselves in any free seat at the hotel entrance. To add to this the air con broke in the middle of the night and made a hideous churning noise, even though it was switched off! After much deliberation from both a maintenece man and unhelpful receptionists at 4am we were upgraded to a 3rd floor studio! ( i would rather have slept on the roof than this room it was even worse then the first!) 3) THE STUDIO!!! IF YOU ARE THINKING OF PAYING FOR THIS SORT OF ROOM DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This room was hideous again filthy carpets ,a crap bed, fixtures and fittings were worse than the first room. The only difference between this room and the first was a sofa and a room with an ironing board! The noise in this room was unbearable whatever goes on underneath seriously needs to be sorted out each night i was kept up until after 4am by banging (people also get banged above!) what noise i can only describe as the dragging of coathangers across a metal bar. this noise is continuous and really loud. 4) the lifts are a waste of time always full and take ages. the pool is full of high class idiots who have nothing better to do in their hollywood wannabe lifestyle than sip martinis by the pool whilst annoying other guests. Staff have no interest in the guests at this hotel it is more intersted in accomodating people who visit on a regular basis. Staff shouldnt take themselves so seriously if they took there heads from other peoples arses they might actually see sunlight although i doubt it since the hotel only has 5watt lightbulbs at best.

But if a hotel is truly great, I do think they deserve a public shout-out. My public shout-out to The Roosevelt is as follows: First and foremost, the hotel is simply gorgeous, a true balance of old and new California. There is a lot of history to this place, and they did a great job of preserving the historical aspects and sprucing it up at the same time. The courtyard-like lobby is stunning. Our room was perfect, clean, comfy, cozy. Loved the Kiehl's products in the room. Because we didn't dine or drink at the hotel, I cannot speak to the service in the restaurant or bars.

The front desk staff were ridiculously rude and full of attitude when we attempted to check in early, so we went to the pool, where the hostess gave us a hard time getting in, and then some guy in a Fedora hat with a little spiral notebook informed us we were not likely to get poolside chairs until 4 p.m. as they were all booked (despite the fact that nobody appeared to be sitting in them). The hostess promptly seated us at the worst table available, which was right next to a bad speaker that was blaring Bon Jovi. The clientele around the pool were total skanks, many of them topless to show off their silicone, I suppose. They appeared to be understaffed that day and it took an hour or longer for the server to bring drinks (which were $16 each).

We showed up at Teddy's at around 1:30 a.m., and were told that we weren't \"on the list.\" I explained we were hotel guests, and we were still turned away.

One of our rooms was no better than a box and only just big enough for the bed. The hotel decor is very dark and the corridors appear even smaller because of this. I went once with the children to the pool, we only wanted to swim as we were off the the Teen Choice Awards later that afternoon, the member of staff at the pool looked us up and down and we were told that we would have to wait for a lounger, when told we didn't want to 'lounge' just swim they found us a stool to put our over clothes and room key, the pool was almost empty although all loungers were full and although my children are very well behaved we were almost sneered at by other guests and staff, we were not even given a towel, so we dripped back through the hotel. Extremely uncomfortable and we have never felt like this at any other hotel, and we have stayed at quite a few and all 4 or 5 stars.

I had a view of the Hollywood sign and Graumann's Chinese Theater. The d\u00e9cor was contemporary \u2013 a bit cold, but the room was very spacious. The bed was comfortable. I had no problem with noise from other rooms. I did get cigarette smoke seeping into my non-smoking room from the bathroom vent, though. It's true the bathroom has a red light right over the sink. But you can turn it off. I agree with other posts -- the lighting in the bathroom is not great for putting on makeup. And, I see what other people mean about the shower not having a full enclosure to prevent water from getting on the floor. But if you shower carefully (not uncomfortably carefully, just with some awareness) you won't have a problem. The hotel is very cool. You really feel like you're in Hollywood. Most people I saw there were young and hip. I did see a few more mature people like myself, though, so I didn't feel out of place. I didn't see any ghosts, but I did think of them when I was alone in the elevator or walking to my room in the dark hallway! The pool is beautiful, especially at night with lights twinkling and fire pits burning. The neighborhood is great for tourists \u2013 I saw Tom Bergeron filming at Graumann's, Kevin James filming on the Walk of Fame, and The Rock at the premier of Race to Witch Mountain at the El Capitan theater.

The Roosevelt Hotel is a gorgeous historic hotel dating back to 1927 which is superbly located in the heart of Hollywood, situated directly across the street from Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Kodak Theatre and the Hollywood & Highland Center. The Hollywood walk of fame runs directly in front of the hotel\u2019s front entrance. The port cochere is beautiful with large drapes and palm trees which gives it an almost safari-like appearance. Entering the hotel is like stepping back in time. The woman who checked us in was very welcoming and the whole process was very swift. We were given a room on the 9th floor, however once we got to the room we discovered it had 1 king bed in it when we had booked a twin bedded room. A quick phone call to the lobby was all it took and they changed our rooms immediately. We were moved down to the 4th floor, but the new room we were given was quite a lot larger with two queen beds fitted with quality Sferra linens which made them amazingly comfortable, a large walk in wardrobe and a small but funky bathroom with great Kiehls toiletry products. The room was very spacious, modern and clean. One thing which set this hotel apart from all the others we stayed in on our trip was that the Roosevelt was the only hotel to offer complimentary wireless internet which was fantastic! My only minor complaint with the hotel is that there are only two lifts and they are quite slow which means quite a long wait for a lift, but I understand that this is a very old hotel so I can easily look past that. We visited the pool area once and from what I could see it looked like a very nice place to relax and have a drink. The hotel oozes glamour and is absolutely stunning. The historic lobby is gorgeous and is lit with candlelight (I think they are candlelight light bulbs that give the same effect) which gives it a dark and moody atmosphere. We didn\u2019t end up eating at the restaurant Dakota which is right next to the lobby but it did look very classy. Instead we ate at 25 degrees burger bar which was excellent. Definitely the best burger I have ever eaten! We went back for breakfast the following day and I was equally impressed with their banana and walnut French toast and blueberry pancakes.

This was a good place to stay if you want to be right in the middle of the action on Hollywood Boulevard, and by action I mean being able to step outside your hotel and be accosted by Daffy Duck or Spiderman or Pocahontas etc. and have shops right at your door. The hotel is opposite The Chinese Theatre so also puts you somewhere easily reminiscable when watching films as you'll frequently see both the hotel and vicinity on tv and in films. There are a lot of bands and celebrities who stay here so this is another level of action that you may seek out. After getting the chance to drive around lots and see different areas I reckon next time I'll probably rent an apartment by the beach, I tend to prefer more low key quiet chilled places with walking potential, and if this strikes a similar chord this hotel may not be for you. Anyway, the hotel itself was made up of a gorgeous exterior and the same if somewhat dark interior, something I've noticed popular in celebrity haunts, 'all the better not to see you with my dear'. The pool is legendary, the rooms okay. Clean a modern take on the 70's but as they are somewhat small and as the mattress sat in the middle of a larger wooden platform I kept bashing my shins on the corners every time I would walk around it- I still have the scars, so this was somewhat annoying. Good desk, smallish window, dark bathroom with not much light, but all in all it was okay. Meals there very pricey, breakfast, oatmeal fruit and tea plus tip set me back over $45.

The location on Hollywood Blvd., is ideal, with plenty going on around the hotel. The room they initially gave me had an interesting style -- an urban, efficiency apartment feel to it, as I walked through (intentionally) dimly lit hallways with carpeting that mimmicked a brick road. The room had a brick wall interior (still dimly lit-- by design), hardwood floors, and a pavement like (concrete?) floor in the bathroom. The problem was---------- the noise. There wasn't necessarily that much noise, but, because of the (extremely) poor soundproofing of the rooms, ... you could hear very clearly every detail of the conversations in the rooms next to you. It was as if you were sharing a cabin with people you didn't know. When I called the front desk, to ask to have my room changed... they 'played' naive about it, but, I sensed this was a common complaint with guests, in that they quickly ended the charade, and gave me a more conventional room in a different section of the building. That room was indeed quieter, but very, very small. Personally, I'm alright with that. When I opened the door, and walked into the new room, there were two staff members (not housecleaning) that had shocked looks on their faces (guilty looks). They immediately hung up the room phone, and bolted out of my room. I was kind of ticked, and called to make sure there were no charges against my room bill. Because there was limited shelf space and closet space, the housekeeping crew accidently knocked my shaving kit into the toilet when they were cleaning. Rather than fess up to it, they quietyly put it back in it's original location. That evening, when I got back to the room, I reached in, and noticed the thing was saturated with all of my toiletries wet., and items saturated. There was construction going on on the (street) lobby level, so guests needed to take the (only one operating) elevator down to the ground level, and hike back up a set steps to get outside. I know each of these issues sound minor and random, but, my general feeling is that for the price they charge per room, you should expect good customer service and attention to details. At a minimum, a reasonably quiet room would seem like a fair expectation. I wouldn't recommend the Roosevelt... not for the prices they charge. I'm probably going to try the Renaissance the next time I'm in the area. I don't expect everything to be perfect.. I just want a clean and quiet room to stay in, with minimal interruptions.

For a two night visit the room size wasn't a problem, but it might be an issue if you're planning a longer visit. The bathroom was lovely too with a good supply of products by 'Fresh'. The hotel itself is very dark, but that's part of its ambience. The reception was lovely and the concierge very helpful. We asked the concierge to book us tickets to The Police who were playing at the Bowl that evening - she sorted it all out for us while we went out sightseeing and our booking confirmation was under our door when we got in (although she did spend slighty more than we'd agreed). On our first evening at the hotel there was a pool party which looked fun, but a bit overwhelming after a long day travelling - it was packed full of local rich kids, with music from a live DJ. The pool area is lovely during the day, unfortunately we didn't have enough time to make the most of it. We ate in the restaurant once and found the service very impressive. The food was lovely although there was not a great choice for my boyfriend who is vegetarian. The breakfast place within the hotel is very good too. During our stay there was a limited lift service which was annoying as it meant a long wait each time, but I'm sure that was just temporary.

We walked into the hotel reception feeling like the Beverly Hillbillies, the staff at reception were cold and unfriendly although the receptionist did give us and upgrade to a cabana (Which he said was overlooking the gardens! and was really overlooking a multistorey carpark with a vine growing up the side of it) The guy who took our bags to the room was friendly he gave us the ins and outs of the place. The hallways were dark, very dark, the cabana room was dark, not as chic as it looks on the website, even with the lights on you need a torch to see in your suitcase. The bathroom was about the same size as the wardrobe and the floor of the room wasnt very clean. All the furniture just looked cheap and tacky not great for the price! We ventured off for a drink (out of the hotel) and luckily we met a nice couple who was also staying in the Roosevelt, after a few drinks we all decided to head back to the Roosevelt and keep on drinking at the Tropicana bar which is at the poolside at the Roosevelt, I had this idea that it would be full of Hollywood glamour and lots of beautiful people but it wasn't. Everyone was dressed casually, very arrogant, rude and pretentious. The hotel was overrun with teenaged kids spending daddy's money. We were made to feel like intruders everytime we wanted to go to our room as the tropicana security staff would stop us and ask us where we were going and check us off their list, even if you had a bottle of water you were asked to get rid of it (BUT IM JUST GOING TO MY ROOM FOR GODS SAKE!) Don't even bother to ask any of the staff about the history of the hotel, because they don't know. Just read it up before you go and educate them while your there. Also don't bother saying hello or smiling at the staff because they just look at you like your off your trolley. The room was noisey all night long, the walls must be paper thin. Loud music, car alarms, talking from the rooms nearby, dont even get me started on the airconditioning unit! Honestly I thought this hotel was going to be chic, sexy elegent, classy, brimming with Hollywood history and Glamour and it was totally the opposite, which is a big shame. The owners of the hotel seriously need to reconsider who they are contracting the leases of the bars to as they are making this hotel a very uncomfortable place to stay. This hotel could be a magic piece of old Hollywood if it was just managed properly. We left after two nights and I couldnt believe that while we were waiting for the car to be brought round for us to leave, the car valet guy told us which room Marilyn Monroe had lived in for two years and it was the room right across from ours. I'd asked the staff several times and no-one knew. I couldnt believe it i had walked past the room several times and the door had been open and I didnt get a proper look. :( Over all a complete let down.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cNoisy Roosevelt\u201d", "Author": "australian_8", "ReviewID": "UR20882677", "Content": "The hotel is very nice albeit very dark.

Marilyn Monroe used to live there in one of the suites above the pool, and she also had her first modeling job at the pool. Many of the old moviestars used to hang out at the hotel for drinks, and it still has that classy feel. The first Academy Awards was also held in one of the meeting rooms there. Rooms: The first night we stayed in the Cabana suite, which was amazing inside. It overlooks the pool, which as other reviews mentioned, does turn into a hotspot at night with fun music and a young crowd. The other nights we stayed in a standard room. It was very nice as well. Soft feather comforter! The only downside is that only the suite had bathroom counter space, so as a girl, it was hard to get ready with just a sink. Pool: The pool is one of the most popular, if not THE most popular, hotel pool in Hollywood. It's surrounded by 50s style suites, pretty palm trees, has wonderful soft lounge chairs/beds, as well as wait staff for food and drinks. The only reason I did not give this hotel a 5 star is because of some rude staff (not all of them, just some). There is a club called Teddy's that very popular, but it turns into a \"guest list only\" after 10 or 10:30. It is not owned by the hotel, so that's why people can't just get in even if they're staying at the hotel. Most bars/clubs at night are \"guest list only\" so you have to call during the day to get on the list or go early unless you're with all girls. Overall, this hotel is worth the stay just to experience both old and new Hollywood, and it's so close to everything else in LA. 15 min. from the beach, Beverly Hills, etc. The Kodak Theater with all of the famous gold stars and handprints is across the street.

There is a Longs a block away where you can buy anything you could ever possibly need. CONS: There is a coffee machine in the room but you have to pay 3.50 for the coffee in the mini bar. I've traveled all over the world and don't recall ever seeing that before, is it just me or is that a little ridiculous? Closet was dark due to the dark paint and lack of lighting. Water leaks out the side of the shower so you're guaranteed a pool of water under the sink after every shower. Overall it was a good experience but there is one thing I do want to mention. The pool turns into a club at night and can be a rather nice place to hang out - if you can get past the bouncers. I had no trouble getting in but some of my co-workers did. Despite being guests they were told they needed to be with girls and on another occasion they were told they needed to go change their clothes. Being a hotel guest doesn't guarantee entry or that they'll treat you with respect.

Ordered room service which was quick and very high standard. We left the next day looking forward to our return trip. On our return trip put in a more smaller standard room, which was fine because that it what we expected to be in. It had adjoining doors and that is when our problem started. At 3am we were woken by the most astounding noise also consider we had a young child with us. A group of youths were using the adjoining wall as a soccer net. There were shouts,screams and bangs which sounded like it was coming from inside the room. After 15 minutes of this we rang the front desk who said they would sort it out. A further 30 minutes later still no end to this noise, our child was quite scared by then. We rang again and explained we had a young family and by now glass's could be heard smashing and foul language clearly heard. Their response was casual but they would sort it. A further 15minutes later and by now they were up and down the corridors with a video recorder which was the final straw.. I made my way to the front desk and spoke to a very sleepy HINT HINT looking night manager whose only solution was for us at 4am to move to another room which i suggested because the noise had not stopped and we had to be up early the next morning.On telling my wife this she rang the front desk a threatned to call the police to sort it [ which is amazing when you see how much security is on in the daytime] and surprise suprise within 15minutes everthing was quiet. We could not speak to anybody first thing the next day due to us leaving for a trip early and nobody available. To cut a long story short it took 2 hours of chasing when we returned to get an solution from the Management about the next night because our child was to scared to stay in the room. We were told to our amazement that it was not the Hotel's policy to throw these type of noisy people out or move them and it would have to be us that moved room's.

We had no problem getting in to Teddys and also had a great time. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The concierge people, Lauren and Adam, def made our trip great. They got us dinner reservations to Koi and Boa, both great, and also got us into Goa and Villa Lounge. Granted, we spent over $3000 at Villa, but it's still the toughest club to get into in LA at this time.

They also would not allow more than 2 guests per a room at the pool, which only has 90 chairs for the 700 guests to boot. If you wanted a chair you had to get up a dawn and sit in your chair for the entire day or else you would lose it. If you expect to lay out or party at the pool, it is very difficult to do. The hotel also allows their \"guests\" aka, people who greased the pool bouncers and front desk people, to be at the pool making it even more crowded and much harder to get a $15 drink. Don't stay here, you will be disappointed. This is not only my opinion, but many other people who were staying there at the same time also spoke this way and said they would never stay there again.

It took approximately 45 minutes to get there from the airport. Blame it on traffic and we were going against the grain. We took Super Shuttle (book online or just show up at the counter). This was $15. Not bad, as a cab would have cost about $50 (one-way). It took approximately 25 minutes on the Sunday morning we left. I guess LA was asleep. The hotel upon arrival is like a gem. I was highly jealous to see others get off at the Renaissance (right down the street) and I was upset the b/f booked Roosevelt. However, to my surprise, we arrived at the beautiful Roosevelt. The front of the building does it no justice. It is beautiful inside, hip, colorful with restaurants, lounges and plenty of amenities. Check in was smooth. The concierge offered assistance for dinner that night. There were PCs with printers available for printing pre-boarding passes. Great! We arrived to our room, X35. If they offer any room ending with 35 (i.e. 535, 935, etc.) Do Not Take It. This room is right next to the elevator. After major jet lag and a midnight sickness, the elevator ran all night. You could hear the beeps per floor and feel a vibration. And this was a Wednesday night. What were people doing? Where were they going? I don't know. But don't take this room. Not only is it near the elevator, it is SMALL. Very small compared to the other rooms. After a morning complaint, we were moved to another room on the other side of hall, still a side view. This room was (and I'm not kidding) 2 times the size of our previous room. Plenty of space to walk around, be free, think and not feel so crowded. Again, don't let them put you in a room that ends with 35. After that incident, we were given a 50% discount on the first night. The stay was fine afterwards. Side note: They charge a $150 per night hold on your credit card. With 4 nights, that was a hefty $600, that's not outlined to you upon check in. This hold is for incidentals (room service, etc.) Be careful. That's a huge hold. A wedding took place on Saturday and you weren't allowed to enter through the historic lobby, which is a quicker way to enter and exit the building to get to Hollywood Blvd. Also there was an after party for Barack Obama at the hotel after the Presidential Debates, which blocked off the historic lobby entrance and exit on Thursday. This can be a bit of an issue, if its cold, raining, etc and you have to walk all the way around the building. Not a huge issue but for some it's extra effort. Still the hotel is beautiful. I don't personally suggest the in-house restuarants. They aren't that good. 25 degrees is a rip off. Some liked the burgers, but I didn't but at least they are huge (they fed my fiance and I). The fries were delicious though. Across the street are a pizza place with decent meals on the go and a great and cheap diner (the breakfast was awesome). Less than a 2 minute walk is the Kodak Theater, and much more. This is a prime location if you are looking to stay in LA. I would stay here again, if the Renaissance is booked.

Our tour guide took us into the lobby to wait for a replacement, out of the sun and I knew straight away that I was coming back and staying there next time. The lobby and 'public' areas have a real old Hollywood feel and you know that if the walls could talk, they'd tell some great tales! When we arrived at the hotel it was approaching midnight on a Saturday night and the reception area was milling with young trendy people partying. Having just stepped of a 12 hour flight, in track pants and trainers, I felt completely under dressed and a little intimidated and wondered what I had let myself in for. I was made to feel extremely welcome, though, and I have to say that these feelings had disappeared by morning when the hotel was \"back to normal\" (and I'd had a little sleep!). I felt completely at ease for the rest of the trip. Our room was quite big, on the 7th floor, with a view of Hollywood Blvd and a small corner of the pool. Thankfully we were high enough up not to notice any noise from downstairs bar the odd squeal of laughter. We had two large double beds and mine was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. We had a dressing area with a full-size ironing board, electronic safe and plenty of room for clothes and luggage. The bathroom was a decent size with plenty of towels and a bathrobe each. It was a little on the dark but perfectly adequate for the amount of time spent in there. We also had a desk, CD player and a selection of magazines (very useful when the jetlag kicks in at 2am, as was the complimentary copy of the NY Times each morning!) There was a fully stocked (but obviously expensive) mini bar with drinks and snacks, and a coffee machine but they charge something like $3.50 for the coffee and it was pretty awful stuff.(There's a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf next to the hotel - go there instead!) The housekeeper left ice in the ice bucket each evening and put the bedside lights on, and left us a tube of M&M's on a couple of occasions! As there was a corkscrew and bottle opener in the room, we bought our own drinks and snacks from the drugstore across the road (next to LA Fitness) for a lot cheaper. The hotel is in a great location right on the Walk of Fame, opposite Mann's Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood & Highland Center and provided a great base for us to do what we wanted to do using public transport. There are plenty of restaurants near the hotel (mainly in the H&H Center) but by far the best meal we had was at 25 degrees at the Roosevelt. I had read reviews here saying that the burgers are the best people had ever tasted and was a little sceptical but had to try it out and see for myself. I have to say, they really are the best burgers in the world, with lots of different cheeses and extras to choose from, so that you can build your own burger. We had two burgers, half fries/half onion rings (to die for!) and two beers for $60.00 including a tip, which I thought was quite reasonable. The restaurant is open 24 hours a day and you can also order from room service. The staff are really friendly and will recommend options which will or won't compliment each other. I'd fly back just to eat here again! The hotel was quite busy during the day, with conferences and meetings, etc. The only time we were affected was when the lobby was closed for 24 hours for a commercial shoot and we had to use the entrance through the parking lot at the back, which was no real inconvenience. I was a little disappointed not to see any famous people during my stay but then got to sit next to Jesse Metcalfe on the flight home! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Roosevelt, and if money were no object, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. However, I'm planning another visit next year and will look at staying somewhere a little cheaper in the Hollywood area (as this was an early 30th birthday treat to myself, I could justify the expense).", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N.

We felt totally out of place with our books while quietly sunbathing!! The norm appeared to be very much loudness, drinking and dancing by the pool!! One of these sunbathers was one of the contestants from Americas Next Top Model - not our cup of tea I'm afraid. Overall the location is excellent. Mann's Chinese Theatre and the Kodak Theatre are across the road and all the other main attractions such as Universal Studios and Venice Beach are all very close by. Great hotel for celeb spotting - Rushour 3 premiered across the road!

We arrived at noon, before check-in, but were treated very politely at the front desk. They advised that only one room with two beds was available, it was 'nice' and on the 8th floor, but was handicapped accessible. We decided to take the room and it was lovely. It had views of the Hollywood sign, the Chinese Theater and the Magic Castle. It was also quite large and bright. When we got to the room, we noticed that the shower had been used, a bathmat was on the floor and a towel was in the sink. I called housekeeping, they were very apologetic, and said it would be taken care of. We were not really bothered by this, and assume the room was cleaned while the previous guest was at the pool. (This happened to us once when we were at the pool and our room was cleaned early - we did tell the front desk upon checkout, but have no idea if they relayed the message to the housekeeping staff.) We left to do some shopping and have lunch, when we returned the room had been re-cleaned. The poolside bar/restaurant was really nice and since it was extremely hot, the staff was very obliging and moved an umbrella over to our table to provide shade. About the only negative comment is that there are no ice machines, and ice must be ordered from room service. After returning from the theater we really wanted ice water, so I called room service to ask how long it would take. I was assured that it would only be about 10 minutes, but after 45 minutes, we gave up and went to sleep. Next time, I would just go to the 24 hr. restaurant and ask for a glass of ice. Breakfast in the restaurant was also very good. Other comments on this site have mentioned that the pool area and bar are sometimes closed for private parties, but since we had no intention of using the pool at night, or going to the bar (since my daughter is too young) it was not an issue.

After expecting a tiny room I was delighted with the corner room I was given on the 7th floor. It had two twin beds with very comfortable linens, very effective air conditioning and a great view towards downtown LA. The bathroom was not huge, however, it was fine for 1 night, there was also plenty of storage space in the closets in the small corridor as you entered the room. The mini-bar was well stocked however, the prices were extremely expensive. It was good to see that it wasn't one of those mini-bars were the slightest movement of an item causes a charge to be made. This meant it was possible to store a few beers and other items in there with no problem. The historic lobby is dark as had been stated previously however, it was like a calm oasis after battling through the heat and crowds on Hollywood Boulevard. It was also a great place to enjoy a few drinks before retiring as the pool bar is closed on Sunday evenings. I only had a brief opportunity to see the pool area on the Sunday afternoon of my stay, however it definitely had a 'vibe' about the place and was certainly full of 'beautiful' people.

The pool becomes a nightclub at night with a line, but as a cabana guest you have access with no questions. it can be loud until about 1:20am, so be warned.

Chose the hotel because we were expecting a little bit of Old-Hollywood chic, and because of it's central location. Room was tiny by American standards. Particularly the bathroom which more closely resembled one from a Japanese capsule hotel. Room was decorated with a frankly disgusting large canvas photograph. Walls were paper-thin (we could hear conversations in the room next door), bed and pillows weren't particularly comfortable (and my partner swears there was bed bugs due to the mysterious bites she kept waking up with), though the TV had a good selection of channels. The hotel istself is so dark and dingy. Even with blazing sunshine outside, it's very gloomy in the lobby. It's also very noisy and busy; there always seemed to be something happening. The doors are also patrolled by angry doorman, who on more than one occasion prevented me entrance into my own hotel! It felt like tryng to get into a trendy nightclub at times. Worst experience by far was on our last night (hoping to get a good night's sleep in preperation for an 11 hour flight!). Having played host to a high-school prom, the hotel obviously allowed a load of the recent graduates to rent rooms. Cue a night of screaming, banging, singing, running around corridors, etc. I've stayed in numerous hotels around the world, and never experienced noise like it. Even my university halls were quieter. At 3am, I finally caved and rang the front-desk. The phone rang for 5 minutes before finally being picked up - \"We'll send someone right up sir\" - which of course they didn't. It got to 4am when I eventually went out into the corridor myself to try and reason with them. In fairness, they did start to quiten down, but it was a draining and restless night to say the least. Ironically, despite the dark gloom of the main hotel, the rooms are suprisingly and dissapointingly bright at night. A combination of the cheap curtains, and the fact a spotlight shines directly at the windows... used to highlight a 50-foot high fashion advetrtisment emblazoned on the side of the building.

While it does live up to that reputation, my trepidation turned out to be unfounded, fortunately. We arrived at the valet parking and the valets did everything valets should do - open doors, unload the luggage - and did it cordially. I went to the check in desk - the two gals there seemed cooly efficient but without much friendliness. The guy that checked me was more pleasant, a brief credit card glitch was handled quickly and without fuss. We needed, and got a deluxe two queen bed room on the 4th floor of the main building (the only two bed rooms are deluxe queens in the main building), but were told there wasn't room for a rollaway. I think we could have squeezed one in but it would have been tight. The room was a decent size, not very large or small. It had a desk with vase and (fake) flower, a TV stand/cabinet, nightstand, and a mini-bar refrigerator. Fortunately the mini bar didn't have those motion sensors so we could put other stuff in it. Although we didn't consume anything from the mini-bar, the prices were pretty decent for a hotel. The nightstand was a little beat up but otherwise the furnishings were in good shape. There was also a CD player which was good for us as it was kind of a musical trip and we had CDs with us to get in the mood. The room's color scheme was in chocolate brown/ grey/light beige, cooly stylish. The room came with a pill bottle on the nightstand filled with beige and white M&Ms. There were two phones in the room, but one didn't work. I liked the bathroom a lot - while it wasn't very large (about the size of one in an old city apartment) I liked its style, and it had nice toiletries. The view from our room wasn't much, but at least there was somewhat of one - I wasn't expecting much of one because I'd Priceline'd it. Service was good - they handled getting our luggage from car to room and requests for things such as extra towels and glasses (there were only two of each) were handled promptly. One thing that didn't work (or barely did) - the in-room wireless internet. I don't know if we were in a dead spot or if it's like that throughout the hotel. However, there are two countertop laptops connected to a printer in the check-in lobby, use is complimentary. Would've been nice to have had stools to sit on while using them, rather than stand. The common areas of the hotel are dark - very dark, particularly the main lounge/restaurant area. A bit of a pity as it was harder to see the classic old details in the interior architecture. We did eat a late lunch at the hotel's gourmet burger restaurant, 25 Degrees, and I must say that was a delicious, messy burger and great chocolate milkshake. The pool area was very nice - while we didn't swim in it, we went to the pool bar on a quiet Monday night, which made for a mellow time relaxing poolside on the chaises having a couple of (pricey) drinks.

But I was intrigued to see the property. First of all, arrival is a nightmare. The valets were so behind on a Saturday afternoon that traffic was backed up all the way down the side street next to the hotel. After waiting for a minute I swung around and parked on Hollywood Boulevard. The line at reception was 20 people long, and took forever -- one gets the feeling the young women working the desk were not hired for their brilliant interpersonal skills. Over to the elevator, and there's a crowd there as well. One of the two elevators is broken, and people are waiting up to a half hour for a lift. Finally making it to the room, and yes, it's nice -- due to a problem with the reservation I've had to get a nicer room (long story and not the hotel's fault), and it's quite the space -- two bathrooms, a sitting area, all very well designed, a step up from the cheese-modern Standard. But then I open up the laptop to get some work done and the complimentary WiFi is barely functional -- a website takes 5 or 10 minutes to load, if it loads at all. It was like that all weekend. I went to check out the fitness center, but even though it was mid-afternoon, it seemed closed, and very small. The party scene around the pool was amusing (if a little crowded for someone just interested in a swim). Every girl was a Hollywood proto-starlet, every guy was a steroid-enhanced dude in a baseball cap. Getting my car back, even though it was parked right there in the parking lot, was a nightmare -- a line for the valet window, then a giant crowd of angry people outside, and it took about 45 minutes. I learned quickly to avoid Hollywood Boulevard which was always snarled with traffic, and just walking to the Hollywood and Highland mall to buy a swimsuit was a challenge. Again, the room itself was lovely, with a large bed and a great shower with nice soaps and stuff. Rowdiness on lower floors (and especially around the pool) seemed like it would have been a nightmare for anyone wanting to sleep, but I didn't have a noise problem, other than the deafeningly loud fan that I couldn't figure out how to shut off until I called the front desk the next day (hint: it was the giant switch in the circuit breaker).

It is a beautiful hotel on the exterior, but I was underwhelmed by this bare bones hotel room. The sheets were \"itchy\". Don't know why. Didn't sleep well. I expected a romantic, old fashioned Hollywood Inn that had that 30s-40s retro feel with very clean rooms. Instead it was more of the kind of \"party\" room you would get in Palm Springs near the pool area of a small to midsize hotel during Spring Break. I'm sure the hotel probably has other rooms that are more what I was thinking of. But I was slightly disappointed anyway. The hotel restaurant has ugly decor that looks like something someone's grandmother picked out. Not retro and not period style, like it should have. Food was over-priced and mediocre. They need to develop the lobby bar area into a more user-friendly part of the hotel. It's too small. They should spritz up the outside of the hotel with fresh paint and some cool old-style awnings.

I found the front desk folks a little snobby, but the bar staff both in the big room and by the pool was really nice. You can't beat the main, candle-lit room with its big, comfy leather couches as a place to hang out with someone else (however, you can beat the drink prices!). I love the history of the hotel (1st Academy Awards held here, etc). My room by the pool (room 121) was cool, slightly dark but moody, with a Sharp flat-screen TV with pay-per-view movies, comfy bed and bedding, good toiletry products, Bose CD player/alarm clock, and the New York Times brought to the room each morning. The chairs by the pools are very comfy, with the oversized fitted towels on each one. The pool is amazing looking. Valet parking is $23/day and includes unlimited in-out priveledges. That's your only hotel parking option. TIPS: 1. Stay in a pool-area room. The hotel rooms in the main tower aren't as interesting in their design. Staying by the pool makes you feel like you're in a small, trendy boutique hotel, plus gives you access to the pool bar if it's really hopping. If you need the space, you can stay in a big suite in the main tower, but then it has the \"big hotel \" feel. 2. I stayed in a room that didn't face the pool. This was cheaper, and would be much quieter in the heat when the bar is hopping. 3. Eat a (expensive) burger at 25 degrees, but split the fries (and you could easily split the huge burger, too). Otherwise, you're in for a huge check. For cheaper eats, Mel's Diner is close by. 4. Have a drink by the pool! So swanky. 5. Book directly with the hotel. They had access to room options that weren't on any travel websites, and my rate was cheaper than the rate a friend paid on Orbitz (PLUS they didn't have my friend's room). I'm sure some have good web-booking experience, but in my experience the only way to really know they'll have your room is to book directly. I buy plane tickets on Orbitz, but book hotels directly for the piece-of-mind. 6. There's a liquor store one block away, which will give you drinks in your room much cheaper than the minibar! GRIPES: 1. I had trouble connecting to the hotel's free wifi, but I was able to get onto someone else's open wifi, so all wasn't lost. The front desk did offer to give me a cable so I could plug into the wall for internet access. 2. VERY small hang-up closet. Four full-sized drawers, but maybe enough space to hang up 12 shirts (the hang-up closet is about 18 inches wide - so if I wasn't travelling alone...) 3. No hooks on backs of doors or on walls for quick hangup of clothes, etc. 4. Desk chair is modern looking, but not soft to sit on. It needs a cool cushion on top of it. 5.

I had also been advised that the tickets for the NYE party were going to be $50.00 we nearly got charged $100 but got that down to $75.00 and since I have sent them the email confirming we would be charged $50.00 and since had the refund. Check your bill throughly upon departure. Due to the downs there were all the ups too and we did spot a celebrity or 2 here, but don't expect to get near to Teddy's - A listers only and you would be lucky even to find the entrance.

They advertized a spectacular prix fixed dinner on New Year's Eve and we were told that the price was $100.00 per person. When we arrived, we were warned by the parking valet that 1000 people were expected to show for the huge party and that the night might not be as expected since we were a couple in our fifties. We explained that we had to access our dinner reservations and gave up the car. The \"spectacular\" dinner was a tiny appetizer that could easily fit on one forkful. The waitress said it was foie gras but I am very familar with foie gras and the appetizer I ate was only pate'. My date had soup which was the only decent appetizer on the menu. For the main course, the menu said that one choice was a 2 1/2 half pound lobster out of the shell. Again, the portion was only 2 or 3 forkfuls with no vegetable or potatoe or salad. My date's dinner was 2 tiny lamb chops undercooked with no sides. We were both very hungry when dinner was over and ate the desert which we normally pass on. We each ordered only one glass of wine during dinner and when the bill was presented, it was $550.00. We questioned the manager on such a gross discrepancy of what we expected and we were told that there must have been a \"miscommunication\" as dinner was $200.00 per person and an $85.00 gratuity was included in the total cost. I was so embarrassed for my date who was visibly upset but being the gentleman he is, paid the bill without contest. He did tell the manager that the dinner was certainly not worthy of 200.00 but she just shrugged her shoulders. We then went to the \"party\" at the pool. Amazingly, the door man let us in but for the dozens of young people in line behind us who paid $100.00 just to get into the party (that offerred a fee for service bar), the dorrman told all of them that the party was filled to capacity and he couldn't allow any more bodies in there. People began to loudly protest, but the doorman just shrugged and said, \"Sue me.\" The blatant disregard for custormer service, the grossly unacceptable dinner, and the exhorbitant fees connected with this evening should be a warning to anyone who is even considering dining, visiting, or staying at this hotel.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cSmitten by the Roosevelt\u201d", "Author": "bryncellen", "ReviewID": "UR6470336", "Content": "Stayed at the Roosevelt in a Cabana room for five evenings in late November.

It is what it is and we felt it would have been a shame to turn the lights up and ruin the atmosphere and architecture. The hotel has two laptops with free internet connections in the check-in area which we thought was a great nice touch. The hotel is also only about a block from the Hollywood/Highland center and the metro stop there. For all of those who say don't take the metro we disagree! We thought it was great! We took the FlyAway bus from LAX to Union Station and the metro the rest of the way to the hotel. It only cost us $4.50! Two weeks later we stayed at the Hotel Mosaic in Beverly Hills which uniformly receives good reviews on TripAdvisor. We agree that it is a great hotel, but we liked the Hollywood Roosevelt more!

They made me produce ID and my key to walk down the corridor at 2 in the afternoon! Remember - I'm only going from Reception to my room. This would be understandable if Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were poolside with Paris Hilton and Simon Cowell, but these 'events' seemed to be made up of a crowd of wannabes desperately hoping the next person to walk in was famous on any level whatsoever. The Cabana rooms are small, pokey and dark, with laughable 'patios' and the level of service (apart from the sparkling car valets) is surly at best. Did I mention the rolling hotel power test that meant I had to shower in the dark? A blackout they announced via a note delivered at 5am? And upon my complaint suggested I might like to shave by flashlight? We all know what to expect from hip hotels (poor service, dark rooms, happening bar action), but this place makes the Hudson in NY look like the Four Seasons. And because of its proximity to Hollywood's tourist ground zero it never really manages the full conversion to style hotel. I tried it because I had read good things in various style bibles in the UK, and all the good hotels in West Hollywood were full. Don't make this mistake!

I read some reviews saying it\u2019s very dark, but get over your Hilton, this is a designer hotel and a legendary place! It\u2019s just really lame that the concierge desk is located in the basement and not in the superb historical lobby, which remains empty all the time. We had a standard room and were happy with it, although it was small and not exactly luxurious. Decoration was modern & low-key, Debbie Harry picture above the bed, tiny bathroom, but everything good taste, recent and in good shape. We had a view on the Chinese Theater and never had a noise problem as other guests pointed out on this site. The poolside is exquisite! Lovely food and nice service, excellent music (from Bloc Party to Bob Marley), the perfect oasis after long days of shopping and walking. We particularly appreciated the sophisticated crowd with NO KIDS, this is definitely not a family hotel and we liked that! About the Tropicana Pool Bar (which is basically the poolside after 9pm): there\u2019s an access to the club in the lobby, BUT : If you\u2019re not staying in a cabana pool room but in the tower (understand : the ghetto!), you won\u2019t get in from there. You\u2019ll have to go to the outside entrance and queue just like anyone else! Although we were infuriated by those stupid rules, we decided not to make a fuss about it (because we were on holidays and because getting in a club has never been a problem to us), so we went to that outside entrance and got in without a problem, the host at the door was actually very nice! I guess they have it this way so that the people who rule the club (not the hotel itself but independant promoters) get to approve anyone who gets in. Things were always easy for us because we are young and good-looking, but I understand that other guests that throw a lot of money in this hotel and do not match the sophistication criterias of the club could be turned down, which is unacceptable.

The lobby area might be dark, but it has been very attractively renovated and captures the older feel of the building with a contemporary twist. The service throughout was friendly enough, never rude or snobby, though not of Four Seasons caliber. My room was as expected --- small, rather dark, though clean and nicely renovated. The bathroom was absolutely tiny, which is often the case with hotels in older buildings, and water leaked from a gap between the glass partition at top of the tub and flooded the floor after a brief shower. I had plans all evening and wasn't around to spend time at the Tropicana bar, pool ,or restaurants, though they all looked like a lot of fun.

The bathroom does have a unusual red light but there is a normal light you can use as well. It is true the lobby is very dark but all we did was walk through it to exit so I do not see the big deal! The pool area has been re-done and looks good. The day we checked out and were waiting to go to airport, they were dozens of young hip guys and girls exiting in their swimwear and receiving their cars from Valet parking, so I presume that there are many people at the pool area not staying at the hotel. Which to me is not right, for as a guest of the hotel you should be able to use the pool when you want and not have it domiated with non-guests. This hotel is definately catered for a younger crowd, as I am 25 I did not mind it. The location is great for Hollywood.

I could not find my card key in my bag the lobby was so poorly lit and people were almost walking into each other, I kid you not. My room was frightening.

Generally I enjoy breakfast in bed, but at the Roosevelt I could not wait to get out of the hotel in the morning. To be fair I think whether or not someone likes the Roosevelt depends on what you are looking for in a hotel. So I will list the positives and the negatives. Positives- 1. The front desk was very nice and we were upgraded to the Cabana section of the hotel so we had access to the Tropicana during our stay. I'm not sure what is so great about the Tropicana, but if you are looking for $14 drinks then I guess this is a perk. 2. We had dinner in the restaurant, the food and service were excellent. I ate the veal 2 ways and it was incredible. Negaitves- 1. The airconditioner did not work properly and our room stayed a consistent 79 even though we set the thermostat lower. We were told engineering was working on this, but during our 3 day stay nothing ever changed. 2. The room is very, very, dark. The walls are painted chocolate brown and the lighting is very bad. The unscreened window opens to the street so we did not open the windows. There was not enough light in the room for me to comfortably read a book. 3. You can easily hear you neighbors talking, listening to the radio, or watching TV. 4. The bathroom more closely resembled a jail cell than a luxury bathroom. The room is concrete, the shower is concrete. There is no tub or any hint of luxury. 5. The concierge was not very helpful and insisted that he must make us reservations at restaurants rather than given us some options and letting us make our own decisions. In summary, I would not stay at the Roosevelt again. When getting away with my husband I look for a luxury room and amenitities. It appears this hotel is for people who want to be seen at the pool and the Tropicana bar. The pool is nice, but it does not make up for the lack of quality in the rooms.

Our suite was pretty nice - a large room with some design-junky furniture overlooking the hills. It had a white leather banquette and a spray-lamp and a lot of interesting art. It was quite a nice room. Got room service once and it was actually very nice and prompt. But the fun kind of ended there; first of all, the other couple booked and paid for a junior suite on expedia. The Roosevelt told them there were no more junior suites and because they went through expedia, they wouldn't be able to get the suite. They were relegated to a standard room - which was about 1/5th the size of our suite. Beware - don't let the front-desk people at the Roosevelt take advantage of you like that. I think there are several reviewers on this site that had similar experiences. If you pay $150 for what expedia advertises as a \"junior suite\", you should get a \"junior suite\". I've contacted expedia about this. The hotel should quit this consistent and suspect practice. Moving on, the ceiling vents in all the rooms on our floor were under a well-lit catwalk under the roof. So maintenance could (and did) get to look into the room, and you could hear whatever was going on in every other room on the floor. When people partied until 4:a.m. then had a fight, my husband and I were privy to every last dramatic detail. When another family ordered room service 3 hours later, we knew what they ordered. The alternative was to turn on the A/C which sounded like a jet engine. The vents in the other couple's room were worse. Bathroom was very small, out-dated. The main ventillation was into the bedroom (not good). The toiletries were great - but only *some* rooms got lotion and body-gel while others got shampoo and generic soap. The more I think about that, the angrier I get: Just give us all the good stuff! How much could you be saving? The Roosevelt's club is evidently the hottest club in the town. But as a guest, you can't go to the club. Don't try it, don't think about it, just leave it alone. It's not going to happen unless you book a $400 cabana. I talked to a guy who had a suite and tried to get in the club. A bouncer took him aside and told him he'd let him in if he paid him $350. Elevators: mind-boggling. Took some people 45 minutes to go down 12 floors. I got acquainted with the fire-well by the 2nd day. OK so the interiors of this place look nice and our room had a lot of style to it. There just wasn't enough good stuff to make up for the snobbery and alienation. I can't remember a time I paid so much to stay at a place denied me full access to its ammenities. Bottom line, this place cuts way too many corners because it thinks it can get away with it on unwitting tourists.

The bell staff gave quite a bit of misinformation. Upon entering our room we had to double check that we were in a room and not a closet. I was shocked that for $300 a night we were staying in a box barely fitting for a single person. The online descriptions of their rooms as opposed to the one we got was COMPLETELY misleading. We required a roll away bed, and when it arrived it didn't fit in the room!!! We had to pull the mattress off the rollaway and lay it on the floor. It was the most uncomfortable sleep I've ever had in all of my hotel experiences, springs in my side is not what I would expect from a hotel held in such high regards. After our night on the town we returned planning on getting a little pool time in. Upon our arrival we asked what time the pool closed, we were told 2am. We were all ready for a swim and after making our way down we were told by a doorman that the pool was open only to those in Cabana rooms or on a guest list!!! We had paid $300 dollars for a box and couldn't even use the amenities of the hotel!!! The next day we made our way to the pool and though the food was great, the service left much to be desired. Our \"server\" didn't bring the correct amount of drinks we ordered, she brought us the wrong menu to order from, which we weren\u2019t informed of until almost an hour later, now mind you, we had already been waiting with our tummies growling only to be told we still had to wait for our food to be prepared. We had to check out by 1pm and we inquired if we could still use the pool after our check out and we were told we could. So we left our things so as to not lose our spot, and went to check out. Upon returning to the pool we were greeting by an EXTREMELY rude guy working as a doorman for the pool. No one informed us we were only allowed 2 guests pool side for the room we had reserved. We tried to explain that we had been out there all morning, left our items to secure a spot, told we could return to the pool but he wouldn't budge. His attitude was horrendous!!! we understood that the hotel had it's policies, but he could've handled the situation in a totally different manner. He was fed up with us and told us if we had a problem to take it up with the front desk, so we did. We explained our issue to the front desk manager and he said that it would be no problem and he would speak with the rude employee. Upon returning to the pool he blew up and said we couldn't enter the pool area and he didn't care what anyone said, and stood by his reasons of \"doing his job\". I found it odd that someone working the door had more say than a Manager. Disturbed and frustrated we gathered our things and left. The hotel staff left a bitter taste in our mouths after such a sweet weekend, not the best way to end our fun weekend. It wasn't so much the hotels policies that bothered us (although we found them ludicrous) it was the attitude, the lack of decent customer service.

Unfortunately, they couldn't accomodate our request, but said they can give us a 'cabana' room on the ground level (no change in price). They advised that it could get a bit loud at night due to the festivities that take place in the pool area in the evening. We agreed to this room and off we went in search for our reserved room. As soon as we opened the door, we were amazed at how awesome the room was! The only bad thing was there was only 1 king size bed for 4 of us girls. However, I was in awe with the room decor. The bathroom was so awesome and chic! We had a ground level patio with a lounge chair and table. Our cute bell boy brought our luggages from the valet area and updated us on the nights events. We were very excited to hear that since we have a 'cabana' room that we are entitled in and out privelages of the pool festivities. While everyone waits in line to get in where the party's at, we just had to flash our room key and confirm our room number and reservation name. The hotel restaurant was delicious and we were honored to have the wonderful service. We didn't have reservations, but they easily accomodated us after a 15 minute wait. The hostess and wait staff were very courteous and fun. After dinner we went to the pool festivities (didn't have to wait in the huge line) where we encountered Kimberly Stewart and Hank Azaria. The pool festivities were hopping and the drinks were great! Great place for anyone who wants to have fun and possibly hook up. At the end of the festivities, we went back to our awesome room. I would've had a good night sleep had it not been for the people walking and talking throughout the hallways during the early morning hours. After a few hours of tossing and turning (5:30 AM), we finally called the front desk to get the noise level toned down in the hallways. The walls must be really thin because 5 minutes after the call, I heard security asking the folks in the hallway to keep it down. The bed was the most comfortable I've slept in a looooong time!

Have always had a good experience. Let's start with it's biggest selling-point - the location. Directly opposite Mann's Chinese Theatre, you could NOT be better positioned in central Hollywood. You have the Metro station within 2 minutes' walk, various small stores/restaurants at the Highland/Vine Centre a block further on, the awesome Hollywood sign overlooking the whole neighbourhood and the Hollywood Walk of Fame running right past the front door of the hotel. Hollywood itself, if you have not been there before, can come across as rather seedy, with many tacky tourist shops and, shall we say \"alternative\" residents. However it has seriously cleaned up its act over the past few years and now feels safe to explore, even at night. And if it is evening entertainment you are after, take a cab or drive a couple of miles into West Hollywood where you will find Los Angeles' famed nightlife along Sunset Blvd (House of Blues, Viper Room et al) Or try Santa Monica Blvd, a few blocks to the south of Sunset, for a wide range of gay bars/restaurants. Back to the Roosevelt. To the rear of the hotel is one of the most peaceful pool areas I have come across - shaded, quiet, relaxed, the perfect getaway from the noise and commotion of Hollywood Blvd out front. I have read reviews about the horrendous price of the valet parking - for this area, the fee is pretty standard and my vehicle was already brought around very quickly. Again, I have seen reviews that the rooms are not up to scratch. I have to say, the refurbished tower rooms (which were all completed in 2004 I believe) are fantastic. They are not in typical US style - much more Northern European, with a trendy, IKEA-feel to them, I can really see them appealing to Brits and Europeans much more than to Americans. The beds are low-profile with sleak, minimalist headboards and feather duvets/ pillows. The bathrooms, although small, are very modern and the housekeeping was excellent throughout my stay. Make sure you ask for a high floor room as the views are fantastic - either the Hollywood hills to the rear or the City of Los Angeles to the front. If you want a central Hollywood property with a very good standard of room, you really need to be looking at this one.

Nov. 20, 2004. We had driven out with some friends earlier that year and were interested in all the paranormal things we had heard and read about. We were also breathtaken with everything it had to offer, thus making us want to return to stay. So I looked online to see what their rates were, but I called to make the reservation. I booked a junior suite for one night at the price of $189, plus an $18 valet fee, but with unlimited in-and-out privileges. The valet shouldn't really be that much because the valet staff was average. The check-in staff was very polite. We were given a beautiful, large room, with a view of Hollywood Blvd. that we didn't even ask for! We were so excited! The room had a very modern CD player, a big swiveling TV, a couch, coffee table and chair, a dresser w/ a minibar.. a big beautiful COMFY bed with plush soft linen. The bathroom was awesome. It had an old-time Hollywood feel to it, and it included an amazing shower and a separate bathtub. Now i read a lot of the reviews and everyone's complaining about how the pool wasn't available because of renovations. If you're really going to be that intent on using the pool and/or jacuzzi (like me and my b/f were), find out! All i had to do was go online and click on the pool and it said it was going to be closed. I didn't freak out because I WENT PREPARED. However, the staff did inform me that they had a deal going with the hotel across the street (i think it's called renaissance, not sure) that the roosevelt guests could use their pool. Well, before attempting to walk over in our bathing suits, we took a stroll to inspect it. It was an extremely long walk through very public places where we did not want to walk in our bathing suits, wet or dry. And when we got to that hotel, we asked the front desk if they had a jacuzzi and the woman looked at us as if we were extreme idiots and huffily replied no. She made a horrible impression on us. thank god we weren't staying there. So, yes, we were disappointed about not having the pool, BUT we were prepared. Never assume anything, because obviously it leads to disgruntled people and disappointment. But it can be easily remedied by just asking the question \"is the pool open?\" One more thing that I should mention. I also read in a lot of reviews about how the staff cares more about any functions that may be going on in the hotel rather than their own guests. I disagree with that but I had a similar issue. My boyfriend and went to take the stairs up to the main entrance that leads you to Hollywood Blvd. There were no signs or anything saying that something was going on. There did happen to be a wedding and they were in one section of the room that wasn't in the way of the exit. But someone working the party(?) ran over and immediately stopped us and said \"sorry you can't go through here!\" He got right up in our personal space and was very rude about it. We were innocent..we didn't know. So, if they're going to have any sort of event...especially where this wedding was, make a sign. Other than that, we absolutely can't wait to return to the hotel...when we have money..because yes, it is expensive, but it's a wonderful experience.

For whatever reason, they don't use the front entrance as the main entrance anymore, which is a shame because your first impression is of a cramped den-like area, rather than the rather grand lobby where you can picture the way the hotel was \"back in the day.\" Details--like not being forewarned that the pool was closed for renovation, the overpowering smell of the deodorizers in the hallway and room, a worn school folder for the stapled menu and ratty photocopies of other information, and the lack of a top sheet on my bed--leave a sour taste for a $199 room. It could be that the nicer more expensive rooms are, well, nicer. The management company really should get its act together fast because it is almost there. I found all the staff really eager and helpful except, interestingly a front desk manager-type who was obviously sick of the service industry, waiting for that big break.

It was kind of annoying having to drag the luggage down stairs to go to the desk however! I was told by the guy on Reception that they were going to give it all an overhaul, as the steps caused a lot of problems.

As far as Suite's go, I have had bigger at other hotels but it was still lovely to be upgraded! The room had a living area with a big comfy sofa and armchair, divided bedroom with two Queen Size beds, and two bathrooms. Having two bathrooms between four girls was definately a bonus! One interesting thing I noticed though, is the bathtub in one of the bathrooms appeared to be original despite new tiling and decor. The bathtub was made out of proper tough porcelain, not plastic, and the shape and strength of it, made me think it had a lot of age to it. This said, there was cracks in the porcelain around the plug hole. No big deal. The bathtub still did the job, and I figure it would cost a fortune to get fixed- and it's still better than modern junky plastic ones! The location of the hotel is superb if you want a Hollywood experience. Right in the middle of Hollywood Blvd, across the road from Manns Chinese Theatre and a shopping mall! Seemingly, Hollywood has started cleaning up it's act in the past few years. It isn't as glamorous as it once was, but is making vast improvements. Like I said earlier, the front desk staff were superb, we had some problems with a cab company overcharging us, and the hotel employees helped us out! They were always so friendly, and always remembered us! We dined at Theodores, the restaurant, for Breakfast one morning- and admittedly the waiter was rather pathetic. He tried to overcharge us (the account was added up incorrectly) and I asked to speak to the Restaurant Manager, who apologised and gladly rectified the situation.

The breakfast was fantastic and we had the time of our lives.", "Date": "July 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "roxboro, nc", "Title": "\u201chistoric hotel,great location, but:\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2227876", "Content": "We stayed June 17,2004 through June 22 and this hotel was in a great location in hollywood,and it was very historic and interesting place,however the pool area was closed along with the cabana bar area that we were looking foward to that was advertised on all web sites and they put us in a small room at first with a small bed,however they did let us change rooms. some one from the hotel came into our room at 2:30a.m. and scared the crap out of us while we were asleep. also they had NO DRINK MACHINES!!!!!! Everyone there was very nice and courtious,especially the valet people even though it cost $18 a day.

Hoped that what I had read up about this hotel it would be so interesting to see where all the famous people and the Oscars were first presented and history. What a disappointment, the staff were non-chalant and uncaring. The first room they showed us was so small we asked for an upgrade which we got. We only stayed a night as we were to carry on with our journey, which was good. The staff were not very helpful at all when we asked for brochures about what to see and places of interest. They gave us a tatty photocopied map and a list of things. Other places we stayed had at least a free book of all the attractions. We heard after we had booked here that it was in a dirty area and tried to change but were unfortunately locked in to the itinerary. We placed our luggage in the bell boy's locker when we vacated the room and went to explore. When we got back to the hotel to catch the shuttle back to the airport we could not find the bell boy and it took several minutes to find someone to get our luggage. The shuttle was late to pick us up also and it was a rush to the airport. At the airport it was terrible, with the checking of the luggage as everything had to go through xray machines, unlocked. We booked out luggage in and then had to take it back to this xray machine. We stood at least for half an hour even more to get through this. We had not much time to get onto the plane for our next destination. I think that the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is a bit of a dump, even though it is being refurbished. All the things that I had read up on that should have been there had been removed somewhere else.

The rooms have been remodeled and are very nice, with a sort of funky Asian look. The bathrooms are especially neat. The rest of the building has a wonderful retro feel--they have done a nice job restoring the original decor. The location can't be beat if you are a Hollywood tourist and the history of the place makes your stay so much more interesting than staying in a chain hotel.

We stayed there on a Saturday night in May 2004- anticipating that there might be a lot of noise on Hollywood Blvd we stayed in the cabana (pool) area at the back of the hotel. The pool and surrounding area supposedly closed at 10p.m. A loud group around the pool continued until 4a.m. and kept everyone in that area awake. Our call to the desk which should have been unnecessary - especially with the \"security\" personnel constantly patrolling - was received politely but the noise continued.

Yes I do agree that this area can be quite dangerous at night but during the day what better place to stay. There are so many attractions, you can go acrosss to the chinese theatre, walk the walk of fame, get a tour from outside the chinese theatre(strongly reccommend ask for the tour guide Brian i think.) go shopping, and all the other attractions that this area has. At night get a taxi to the places where you would like to eat. As for the hotel we thought it was excellent. We were lucky enough to stay in Marlyin Monroe's old cabana room, which hasn't changed from she stayed there. Yes a lot of the furniture was from the 1950's but if it was good enough for her it was good enough for me???? The staff were excellent they were very helpful when we needed directions and places to go to a night.
