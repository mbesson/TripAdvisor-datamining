I ate at the local restaurants around the area which were all excellent and very reasonable. Unfortunately the bar was shut when I stayed, but the guys in the dive centre said it was excellent when open. There was free wifi which was good enough for Skyping home with.

We came across this hotel walking, checked the price and room, and felt it would do the job. The front desk woman was friendly and gave us a bit of a discount, so we stayed. The room was fine, the a/c was ok, and I think there was a bit of hot water in the morning. We enjoyed cooling off in the roof top hammock but were disappointed the pool was closed off at night (it was a very tiny, square pool but it would have been nice to sit in for a few minutes).

If you go on vacation to be out sightseeing, and really just need a clean bed to crash in, this is where to go. However if you have princess needs and spend all your time in the room, keep looking. It's about 6 blocks from the beach, located IN the town and not on the touristy Avenida 5. The bar/restaurant was friendly and had great food, with nice outdoor second floor balcony to sit on. Super friendly front desk. It has some urban noise, but with doors closed and a/c on, it's fine. Only drawback was the shower with VERY little water pressure.

Our room was located on the first floor of the three story hotel and no natural light came in at all. The handful of rooms that face the courtyard may be better but the whole hotel was in need of a serious scrub down. The first day we were there a huge palmetto bug- aka cockroach- walked into the room. We live in FL and see them around also but it was not that comforting to see it right next to your luggage on vacation. The view out of our \"window\" was of shelves of scuba diving equipment. The window was basically a screen with some type of plastic window covering. The beds were not comfortable and the sheets and bedding material need a serious update. My kids slept on their beach towels for the two long nights we tried to sleep there. The positive things about the property are definitely the bar/restaurant with the nice german man Yodon managing the place and doing some awesome cooking and the beautifal and personable Paloma bar tending. The bar has a pool table, dart board and a nice view of the busy corner of calle 4 and avenida 30. You can also go up to the rooftop and see a good view of the city. We paid holiday prices of $75 usd a night and the place was definitely not worth that. There were several long term renters staying in apartments there that are probably much more appealing due to their size and location in the property. I would definitely ask to see your room first before deciding to stay here. We went closer into the beach area and found a nice, bright, CLEAN place to stay for 10 dollars more a night.", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "BALTIMORE", "Title": "\u201cValue value value!!\u201d", "Author": "BEACHESANDTHINGS", "ReviewID": "UR22246244", "Content": "What impressed me was the atmosphere, more than anything.
