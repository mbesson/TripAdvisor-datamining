My room in Premier Wing (#1855) was excellent, with a great view of Raffles City mall & towers and Chijmes restaurant complex from the bay window (see pic). Room itself is good size with modern furniture, very comfortable king bed, Nespresso espresso machine and HDTV. Desk area has wall outlets that accomodate US and European plugs, no need for adapter. The bathroom has separate large bathtub/shower enclosure with rain shower & handshower and Molton Brown toiletries. The tub filler is very fast. Overall the room was impeccably clean and well maintained, staff showed up to replace a burnt lightbulb I hadn't yet even noticed. Gym is spacious glass-walled space on 5th floor, well equipped with modern cardio equipment (treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, rowing machine), weight machines and free weights although the sauna at gym was at the moment closed for renovation. The pool was mid-size and nice, not a full lap pool. The spa was busy, massage therapy was good but expensive.

We asked for a high floor, and should have included a request for a good view. Instead of getting one that had a view of the financial district, we got a room that faced the rear of the hotel, which looked into a rather old and drab by office building, and some public housing in the distance. Not pretty. I tried requesting for a room change, but was told the hotel was booked solid. I believed it at first, but doubted it later when I saw one of the staff going from room to room changing the batteries for the TV remote (on the side which had a good view). As the doors were open, I could see none of the rooms were occupied. An above average perception of the hotel quickly sank, knowing this.

Booked an Executive room through HotelClub a few months prior to the visit. We just breezed through check in at the hotel (at about 3pm) with no trouble at all. Got a room in the 11th floor which was good because it cut off completely any noise from the streets below. The rooms were well appointed and had amenities such as cable TV, mini-bar, full-sized clothes cupboard, and safe. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was big enough, clean and had an enclosed shower cubicle separate from the bathtub - which is good. In fact it was bigger than the bathroom of the King Deluxe room at the Hilton Singapore. No bidet. The only complaint about cleanliness of the hotel is the carpet. It appeared to be heavily stained in the room and along the corridors as well. Also, the room remained very cold even after the air conditioning was turned off; which wasn't comfortable. The location is a definite advantage Carlton offers. The Bras Basah MRT station's just a 3 minute walk away. From there, once you get to Dhoby Ghaut interchange (next station), you have access to trains running on the North South (red), North East (purple) and Circle (yellow) lines; which will help you to get to practically all attractions you'll visit in Singapore. Raffle's City (mall) is located right in front of the Carlton and has a wide selection of branded shops and restaurants as well as a supermarket. Raffle's City also has the entrance to the City Hall MRT station which is an interchange for the North South (red) line and East West (green) line.

Also, the smaller rooms on the lower floors open onto a corridor that smells of gravy; this was consistent with my previous stay at the Carlton, which suggests to me they need to change their air freshener at some point. Good points: the location is great. You're diagonally opposite Raffles City mall, and thus the City Hall MRT is a few minutes' walk. Chijmes is on the other side of the road for medium-to-upscale dining, and if you want something cheaper there's a hawker centre just a few minutes' walk in the other direction. There's also lots of museums and other amenities close by. The gym is good - rather than being hidden away in the basement it's up on the 5th floor, with a view of the swimming pool (if you lean sufficiently), and with a good selection of modern exercise equipment. The pool's also very nice. Not so good: internet isn't free, and breakfast is astronomically expensive - when they quoted us a price for breakfast at check-in I was initially amazed, because it seemed cheap for two weeks. And then I realised that was per day. Room service meals are good, but for the price you pay they should be - and given the nearby competition (like the food court in Raffles City, or the hawker centre down the street) it seems the hotel is only catering to rich agoraphobics. Keycards have a habit of failing to work, which means you may make frequent trips to the front desk to get them reset. Not a massive problem in the general scheme of things, but a little annoying. The image on the television in our room was always much darker than it should be, but I suppose with the view of Singapore out the window you'd be a fool to spend your time watching the telly.

It didn't start off well, when I booked online for 2 adults & 1 child and later found out that I would be hit for extra charges for a foldaway bed for our 5 yr old son. A friend had recently returned from Singapore and said she had this problem, so told me to check with the Carlton. Needless to say I was unimpressed, as when you add on the extra costs for the bed, the total price would have been more than that of a 5 star hotel. In fact most of the 5 star hotels include foldaway beds and cots complimentary. In fairness to the hotel, after much arguing and threatening to take my business elsewhere, they agreed to waive the fee. On check in at 2am, there were no issues apart from the fact they advised us they had given us adjoining rooms with our friends, however, when we arrived at our rooms, we were on opposite sides of the corridor! Our friends had an adjoining room, but not with us! Anyway, we didn't complain, as we weren't fussed. The rooms were very disappointing. Very very dated and the bathrooms were so tiny you couldn't swing a cat. I believe the rooms in the new wing are very nice, although I haven't seen them. The pool was quite good, although we ordered cocktails and they were so awful that we had to send them back and swap them for beer. They were practically undrinkable. Again, in fairness, they took them back and did not charge us for them. The internet cafe wasn't very nice, there was no staff attendance and I had to wait ages for someone to show up and assist me. Aside from this, the lobby is very impressive, the location is awesome, you can walk everywhere. However, due to the fact we have a child, unless the hotel agreed to waive the extra bed fee again, I think I would return to the Swissotel Stamford over the road, which is slightly more expensive, but they provide bedding free of charge.

The best thing about this hotel is the location - it's opposite the Raffles City mall, which sits on top of City Hall MRT, so getting around is very easy. If you're not laden with huge amounts of luggage you can take the MRT all the way from the airport, rather than spend 20 or 30 dollars on a cab. Speaking of saving money, you'll need to save all the money that you can if you want to use the internet in the rooms (20 dollars a day) or room service (a hilarious 9 dollars for a glass of fruit juice). You can walk from here into the centre of town, which is a pleasant 20 minutes when the night is cool, and a perspiration-drenched 20 minutes all the rest of the time. Orchard Road and all its shops is also very close. So there's not many places with a more convenient location than this. The downside of this hotel, and why I end up rating it as average, is that the hotel feels worn out. The carpets in the hallways are grubby, and every day when I left my room and walked to the lift, there was a pervasive smell of unwashed bodies, or soup, or general sadness and ennui, like a gloomy public institution, in the corridor. Perhaps it's because there's no natural light in the corridors. Perhaps they need to give a good squirt of air freshener every once in the while. The room itself isn't appalling, but not brilliant. From little things, like the batteries in the TV remote being dead, to the internet being priced ridiculously expensive (along with the room service, as I've already mentioned), up to the bathroom feeling rather old, the soundproofing against the traffic not being very effective, or the gloominess of the decor and the low-wattage bulbs in the room, it all added up to being somewhere you didn't really want to stay longer than you had to. So I stayed at the office as late as I could, and only went to the hotel to sleep. Breakfast I'd have elsewhere - again, why they'd quote a price of 30 dollars seems nearing offensiveness, unless this was a breakfast served by a minor member of a royal family. It's more disappointing because the foyer of the hotel is lovely, and very recently decorated - but while the new wing may be very pleasant, if you're staying in the old wing like I was, that brand new foyer is a mask behind which an ugly face hides. Staff were friendly and helpful, but again, I hardly interacted with any of them during my stay here.

He also gave extra bed for free as we were a group of four. Hotel room was nice. The upgrade greatly helped us enjoy our stay with the extra space we had. The kids slept in the living room whilst we took the bedroom. Generally no complaints here. It was a typical family room environment with family type furniture.

Close to raffles city mall (2 mins). Suntec is 20 mins walk. Closest mrt is city hall which is in raffles city. There is a mcdonalds at the next block to the hotel. The people in the hotel are mostly friendly. Not the courteous friendly only but warm and friendly. Concierge was good. Two individuals stood out - Waran and Redzuan. They were warm and friendly and even went out of their way to assist me in any way I needed. Internet is horrible. SGD20 a day that I considered ridiculous. It was ironic though that Singapore, being a country quite advanced must still charge such prices.

The staff told us to come back in 3 hours and our room would be ready. Which it was.

The said there were no twin rooms (which is what i booked) then tried telling me that I didn't book a twin room) this was at 1am in the morning when i just wanted to go to bed. It took 35 minutes for them to put me in a twin room. Day 2 at breakfast $38 per head, very average, low grade buffet, the burners were not on under the food and it was all cold, when i told the staff they suggested i eat something else, this was at 7am with many people still to come. No one at the egg station had to wait for 5 mins for the chef to come and when i told him i wanted an egg white omelette he was very annoyed at the inconvenience, Moving to that evening where i had to move rooms and it took 1.5 hours for them to find me a room and then put me in a smoking room and told me it was a non smoking room. It stunk of smoke and had ashtrays everywhere and when i questioned this being a smoking room they replied, they advise guests not to smoke due to poor ventilation but they can if they wish. I do not appreciate being lied to by the staff and being taken for a fool. So after finally getting into the 2nd stinky room at 10pm at night we ordered room service, at 10.45pm we got a call saying they did not have what we wanted and to reorder, we finally had our COLD and tasteless dinner at 12am. My boss who was paying then went to the reception after hearing all that had happened and they compensated me by giving me a late checkout and a cold breakfast at the club lounge, i had booked and paid for an exec room which includes this anyway. In addition, the beds are hard and uncomfortable, television in one of my rooms was so dark i couldn't see the picture, my room wasn't made up until 3pm, I had deliveries not sent to my room and waited hours to get my bags. The hotel is clearly lacking in leadership, currently they have an acting general manager who must not be inspiring any accountability or service level standards within this hotel.

Checking in was a breeze. The reception staff were helpful and genuinely enjoyed their work. The concierge staff were always helpful and arranged a taxi for me for pickup at 4am for flight to Hong Kong. All staff I met always said hello, which was nice. The room was on 17th floor and overlooked the city of Singapore. My room was in the main building or 'old wing' as some have described this part of the hotel. In opinion, it wasn't all that old, and nothing to complain about. The room was spacious and room made up every day by house keeping. The bath room was okay. I am not keen on low ceilings, but it was nothing to inhibit my stay. Something I cherish most about staying in hotels is instant hot water, and here, it was. The television had a variety of channels and you could pay for movies, however, I did not. I used the internet everyday (broadband) and paid $20 SGD for 24 hours use. The internet is charged at 60 cents per minute, but not more than $20 for 24 hours. Therefore, no matter if you left the computer on, as I did, the highest charge was $20 per 24 period. I thought that was a fair deal. The hotel pool was a great respite away from the heat of Singapore and not overly used by hotel guests. I used it every day and towels provided at the pool. You will need sun screen! As part of my booking, I had breakfast included. It was everything one could ask for. All types of food from cooked to fruits to breads and different drinks to be had. I liked their coffee. The hotel is right across from Raffles City Shopping Mall and a short stroll to Clarke Quay for more shops and dining. It is quite central, but then everything is central in Singapore. I booked my stay through the Qantas website and paid for three nights and got the fourth free, with breakfast included. I could not complain about the service or the room. If I noticed anything that was not fantastic, I would say the carpet in some of the hallways was looking slightly tired, but as it is under my feet and I am not sleeping on it, it did not matter!

The rates seemed reasonable at the time, reviews here mainly seemed positive and the hotel looked nice on the website. We originally intended to stay in March, but had to change our travel plans. The hotel was initially reluctant to let us do so and wanted to charge us 100% of the rate (as per their policy) as a cancellation fee. However, they relented, as allowed us to change the booking to September, which was appreciated. I think that this policy needs review. We stayed in one of the regular (superior) rooms and it was a good size, clean (although the carpet looked grubby) and quite well appointed. When we arrived we found a fold out bed in the room instead of the baby cot we had requested. This took a couple of phone calls and, eventually, a visit to the reception desk to resolve. The staff were professional, willing to help and quite friendly. The pool area is small, but quite nicely done although in need to a little renovation. It seems that the more expensive a hotel is the more inclined to charge for things they are. Wifi was available only for $21 per day of $0.66 per minute! The hotel also had no guest laundry, just a per item paid service. When we stayed the Ibis on Bencoolen Street wifi was included and a guest laundry provided. Not that the Carlton is *that* expensive, but it is significantly more pricey than the Ibis. The hotel lacks character or charm.

The toiletries were from Molton Brown. 2 bottles of mineral water were also provided on a daily basis. The furnishings are new, well-appointed and add to the ambience of the room. It looked like some conscious effort was really done to differentiate the premier wing rooms from their regular ones. Their gym facility was well-equipped, with the machines maintained relatively well. Did not get to try the hotel breakfast as I had only booked for the room, but room guests were given some discount coupons to dine in the restaurants in the hotel.

I've visited Singapore for business trips as well as personal trips, and though it isn't the flashiest hotel around, it is the best of the second tier(or 4 star hotels if you will) in Singapore in my opinion. My personal preference when choosing a hotel in a city is to find a hotel which is which is close enough to the central locations but far enough where you're not right in the middle of the madness. I prefer a little distance, and don't mind traveling to the main attraction if I choose to. That said, in terms of location, though not on Orchard road, it is right across from Raffles shopping centre, Chimes(they have some very decent restaurants there) and 5-10mins walk to a lower tier shopping centre called Bugis Junction. Not to mention, there are convenience stores all within walking distance, supermarkets, internet cafes, money changer, restaurants, cafes, and any other stores to fulfill your needs. Location wise, this place is fantastic! As for the rooms itself, I usually stay in the superior or executive room; I wouldn't say there is an awful lot of difference between the two rooms besides a slighter bigger bed. The bathroom is of fairly good size and quality, every so often I get a room where the bathroom door doesn't shut properly, but that is a minor issue not even really worth mentioning. The TV is large, and it comes with multiple channels to choose from. Unlike in many of the Australian hotels, it comes with many of the cable channels! Again, not a big deal unless people choose to travel to another country just to remain in their hotel rooms. I find the service to be professional and helpful. I personally don't need someone to be overly friendly, and in my face or even overly eager. If I need assistance I'd like the staff to be helpful and the staff here from my experience do just that. Mostly I eat out, but when I do eat within the hotel I choose to eat at Cafe Mosaic - you'll see it as soon as you enter in to the lobby. The buffet breakfast isn't the best, but it will fill your stomach nevertheless with decent to good food. In regards to the other foods served at this cafe, I would say it's pretty decent to above average. When you factor in that it's a 4 star hotel, the food is very good. The gym is small but decent, as is the pool. Again, nothing flash but gets the job done. Overall, I'd say it's one of the better 4 star hotels in Singapore has to offer. Good location, good service, clean, good food, and a very decent bed (yes, bedding is extremely important to me; I'm not afraid to admit it!). If you want an affordable yet, comfortable hotel to stay in during your stay in Singapore, Carlton is where I'd suggest.

However, they were kind enough to bring us a voltage converter and also compensated us with free internet for the remainder of our stay, which is quite expensive in Singapore. Over $20.00 per day at the hotel. Next time I will bring my own converter and be prepared. There is an internet cafe around the corner for $8.00 for 3 hours. The beds are smaller that a double but a tad larger than a twin, perhaps a 3/4 bed? We asked for a cot for my niece and it would have cost $80.00 per night plus their taxes extra, so we did without. Our house keeper was very good, she had 2 days off and we certainly noticed it... The hotel location is excellent. We walked and took their MRT system every where. In 8 days we did over 200,000 steps, so we saw and did a lot! I would recommend light \"quick dry\" clothing. It was very warm and humid while we were there. Over 90 degrees with 90 percent humidity. We also had a light rain everyday, just enough to cool us off for a few minutes. We drank lots of water..so plan on spending about $15-20 per day just for water. We also carried a change of shoes, so that our tired feet could get some relief during the day. I didn't bring any local currency, but next time I would bring US$ cash and exchange them at the currency booths. The hotel also exchanged different currencies. But usually the rate is better at an \"exchange booth\". The Singapore $ is about 80% of our cdn dollar. They are known as the 10th most expensive city in the world..and it is quite costly. Some of our favourite places to shop were Bugis Village (10 mins from our hotel) and Chinatown..a quick MRT ride away. There is also Mustafa Market in Little India. We did a very quick tour. We enjoyed eating mostly at the \"hawkers\" and tasted all the \"unusual\" foods we could find.

As several reviewers have already pointed out there\u2019s currently two sides to this hotel accommodation in that there is the recently renovated and decorated premier wing (which befits the hotels 4 star status) and then the standard / delux rooms in the original part of the hotel which do not. We actually stayed in the older part of the hotel as my stay was organised by my company\u2019s local office in Singapore and I got the very good business rate for a standard room that includes breakfast and internet. Yes the d\u00e9cor, especially the carpets in this section of the hotel are tired and worn and the room d\u00e9cor and facilities is a bit on the old fashioned side, but it was large enough and had all the things you want from a hotel bedroom. The air con was quiet and efficient and it was quiet at night. The arrival at the hotel is befitting 4 stars, as its very large and airy, a fair bit of comfortable seating and a wonderful showcase glass structure hanging from the ceiling that looks like it could be an original Dale Chihuly piece (if you are familiar with this American glass artists work ). The pool area is not befitting of a 4 star hotel. The pool itself is small and the changing facilities are basic and with some of the shower facilities broken. But it does provide a facility to allow you to change for a late evening flight if you have checked out the hotel in the morning and been sightseeing all day, which is what we used it for, and for this it was fit for purpose. I found the hotel staff , from the reception desk, concierge and front door staff all to be very helpful and friendly. Especially the concierge who looked after our bags safely on the last day and was forthcoming with maps and local information on how to get to places, and the doormen who organized taxi\u2019s efficiently and managed the sometimes queue of waiting guests in an orderly way. The breakfast was excellent in quality and included both Eastern and Western options. But get it included in your hotel deal because the price of this and the lunch time restaurants are quite jaw dropping. Hence we didn\u2019t eat here except for the breakfast, as there are much better eating options around the hotel. And now we come to the real plus of this hotel, which is its location. Firstly it\u2019s next door to Raffles Hotel and you actually have a shorter walk to the Long Bar than if you were staying in Raffles hotel itself. Then the Raffles shopping centre complex is diagonally opposite and as well as high class shops, has a food hall which provides a wonderful low cost option. Coming from the UK where eating in the food halls of shopping centres is the last resort of the desperate, I was blown away by the choice and quality of the food on offer at a jaw droppingly low price in this case. The available \u2018Pig Organ stew\u2019 is a tasty local dish and the name is just a bit lost in translation. And then the excellent Chimes restaurant and bar centre in an old converted monastery is dead opposite the hotel, giving a great choice of different cuisine restaurant and bars and I strongly recommend you to explore this out in the evening rather than eating in the hotel. And finally there are two MRT stations within 3-4 minutes walk from the hotel, and a leisurely 15 minute stroll will see you at Raffles Landing stage on the river with its new bars and restaurants.. So in conclusion, a hotel with a great location. The new section is worth the money, but only stay in the old section if you can get a good deal with breakfast.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cnice room, slightly overpriced\u201d", "Author": "traveller_au97", "ReviewID": "UR104315483", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel's premier room back in October 2010.

I did make my choice of this hotel based on guest reviews on TripAdvisor. The single overwhelming reason for picking Carlton was its location. Location, location, location....which overrides any other imperfections. Walking distance to multiple MRT (subway) stations, food courts, restaurents and shopping. The staff were reasonably pleasant and mostly efficient. Check in was quick, although there was some confusion about my prepaid on-line booking and the charging of my credit card, the accuracy of which was clarified only after my return from Singapore. No big deal really. A very busy hotel...... was house full on two of my 7 days stay.... remarkable for a 900+ room hotel. It is also the hotel for airline crew including Emirates and crew members frequent the lobby. I stayed in a Premier Supreme Double (translates into = a room in the new 2010 wing, with a city view). The room matters, both in price and experience (read the conflicting opinions of other guests below and you will understand!). In retrospect, I do not think that the \"city view\" of the \"Supreme\" double was worth the extra $30+. The hotel also has the original tower, which guests have reviewed poorly, and an Executive wing, built somewhere in 2005 -2006. The executive wing rooms are priced less than the premier rooms, and I would think it would be worth the while to ask about this. I didn't get a chance to see these rooms - pity, it may have been useful for a future visit. Room size appeared somewhat small. Partly because the bathroom was large. ....I guess. Something's gotta give. Excellent bathroom though, although not very child safe - granite floor tiles are slippery when wet. The Molton Brown amneties in the premier rooms are nice, although they are only sparingly refreshed. This is very evident when you stay longer than the average. The \"window\" between the bathroom and room (in the premier rooms) with a Roman blind on the exterior of the bathroom, does not offer much privacy unless your room-mates are intimate or else trustworthy!! Although the rooms appeared \"clean\" because they are barely an year old, the room cleaning service was poor. Amneties, stationery, bath-robes etc are not regularly replaced and dusting of table tops and vacuuming of floors leaves much to be desired. I had to pick up cereal from the floor (my toddler wasn't the most conscientious in-room diners) when I returned to the room each evening after it had been cleaned. On the first day, our toddler found a used pair of slippers and a hair spray can under the bed. The TV and telephone had a consistent film of dust on them. However, the cleaning staff we encountered seemed very pleasant and courteous. If that helps their cause! Carlton needs to take a look into this. For a hotel priced as it is, the coffee making facility is pathetic. There were two single, out-dated satchets of coffee which never got refilled during our entire 7 days of stay. You would do well to buy your own nescafe and tea and indulge in caffeine as much as you want. We never made use of room service given that the hotel is less than a block away from excellent (and need I say, cheaper) food. BreadTalk at the basement of Raffles City used to be a favourite for breakfast in my student days in Singapore...and it still is. We have dined at the Cafe Mosaic, but were not particularly overwhelmed. Still, for the record there is 24 hours room service which is convenient, at a price. Internet access is available but horrendously expensive, especially given that much of Singapore is wired. I believe you can take your laptop or iPad and walk to Raffles City or any mall and get free internet access. I had the luxury of a friend's mobile broadband service. A good flat screen TV in premier rooms. It would help to include at least one kid's channel like Playhouse Disney / Disney / Nick Jr....it was hard to keep a toddler entertained. The TV reception was not of great quality, poor.......even for some of the local channels. This is something not uncommon to many hotels that I have stayed in. Again, I believe that this can be rectified by Carlton easily. The bed had a Sealy posturepedic mattress, which was a bit too hard for my personal taste, but probably good for your spine! The queen bed was just about enough for two adults and a 4-year old. Beware, the premier rooms CAN NOT fit an additional bed. A baby cot is possible but that would certainly make the room very, very crammed. The Herman Miller ergonomic chair comes as good as advertised. A positive for the premier room. Other trivial details - adjustable air conditioning was welcome. I am not certain that the older wing rooms have this. The premier rooms need a clock...hard to tell the time. The bedside tables are bare, devoid of drawers. Probably part of the \"modern\" decor. We didn't get to use the pool (located on the 5th floor between the premier and old wings) or gym. The lobby is large......cavernous! spacious and appealing. The doormen and bell hops are very courteous. Plenty of taxis at the door (although, there is a queue in the peak hours, especially mornings...consider this if cutting it fine for an appointment).

They also are UNTRUSTWORTHY - the manager finally agreed to letting us check out late at 4pm. However, we find out that they disabled our cards at 2pm instead. I was appalled at the fact that they would so easily lie to us. NEVER have I been treated this way by the hotel, let alone one that I have to pay S$200 a night for!

The room was big enough for my hubby and 2 kids (10 and 7)The down part was we got a double room with 1 queen bed instead of 2 twin beds. But that was alright considering the nice ambience, the super clean room and bathroom. The bed was comfortable enough, the only downside again were the pillows. We had 4 pillows but 3 of which were kinda bulky and too big for my liking. The bathroom was also big and the toiletries were tastely packed. I also found out that there was no free wifi in the lobby. And the room internet costs too much. I visited and used the gym . Theyre open till 11pm. Free use of towel and free water. Dont forget to bring your room key to get inside the gym. My kids took a dip in the pool. We didnt get to see a toilet though or a changing area on the poolside. So if you want to go to the toilet, i guess u either have to go back to your room. The location of the hotel is very convenient to Raffles Hotel for it is just across the street.

I would say this hotel is more of a 3.5 stars rating, but since it's the holidays, I am feeling generous and rounded it up. Pros: -Upgraded to the 18th floor in the new wing. I was booked in the old wing for the first 5 days of my trip (the new wing was fully booked, and i booked very late). However, when I checked in, they managed to get me in the new wing, and upgraded me to one of the highest floors. They still gave me the cheaper rate for the first 5 days. This probably had more to do with the fact that I was staying with them for 2 entire weeks. -Rooms are very clean and very new. Rooms are slightly small, but as a solo person in the room, it was plenty of space for me. The rooms would be crowded for a family. -The rain shower head. It was awesome, and I definitely took longer showers than I normally do because of the shower head! -Location. Within 5 minutes walking distance to both the circle line and the red line. Very convenient to get to most places. Cons: -Hallways and elevators are not air conditioned! For a \"luxury\" hotel, you'd think they'd air condition everything, especially considering Singapore's hot & humid weather year-round. Very odd. -Breakfast buffet. It was included in my room rate, but the selection is very limited and NEVER changes. For someone who stays at the hotel for a few days, it's fine. But I was there for two weeks and was completely sick of the food by the end. I skipped breakfasts at the hotel at the end and picked up some pastries at Breadtalk in Raffles City Mall across the street. -Gym was slightly small. The cardio machines fill up pretty quickly in the early mornings, and they kept the gym at a fairly warm temperature, so after you got your heart pumping, it was very hot. I guess you could consider that a pro if you wanted to sweat a lot during your workout :) However, this also resulted in other people completely drenching the machines & floors with their sweat, with nothing other than a towel to wipe (aka spread around the sweat) off the machines. It *really* grossed me out, and it made me not want to use the gym. -Internet connection. Also included in my room rate, but the wireless connection in my room was spotty at best. I constantly got kicked off the internet, which was irritating when I was trying to do work. -The room had an odd setup where there was a GIANT window in between the bathroom and the bed. On top of that, the curtain the cover the window was on the outside of the bathroom, so you couldn't lower it once you were in the shower. I'm not sure why anyone would want a giant window between the shower/tub/toilet and the bed?? This hotel also is where all the Emirates flight attendants and pilots stay. I saw throngs of them every day. All in all, it was a decent hotel. There were definitely pros and cons, but the location was super convenient.

Now lets get to the things which were not so good about this hotel. Food: If you are a vegetarian from India this hotel is a sheer waste of money. They hardly have any veg options in the menu. and no place nearby in 1-2 kilometers offers anything veg. we wasted 3 hours one evening hunting for some veg food in near vicinity. Nearest option for veg food is little India which is about 2-2.5 kilometeres. Service: As good as a self help budget hotel at the price of an upper end 4 star hotel. they are hardly interested in service. except for check in and check ourt i hardly had any interaction with the staff. Not much helpful in terms of carrying ur luggage or calling a cab for you or giving you some information about the city or even a friendly advice. Value for money: Really BAD. at a rate of over 11000 Rs per night this hotel is a sheer waste of money. very small rooms, not much amenities, very small bathroom. just 2 restaurants that too they shut at 10 pm.

At the very onset, let me state that this is not part of the Ritz-Carlton chain! Hotel is undergoing a refurbishing. And it looks like they started with the Lobby which is very interesting. It had a fairly modern feel to it. Check-in was uneventful. We were told we got an upgrade but this being our first time in this Hotel, we wouldn't know the difference since we did not take the time to check out what was supposed to be our room. Hotel was doing some work on one side of the elevator banks on the ground floor. So from the lobby going up to our room, you'd have less than 1.5 meters of space between the board up and the elevator doors. Worse, if you get on the wrong side of the elevators from your floor, you'd have to exit on the 2nd floor and either take the stairs to the ground floor or transfer to the opposite set of elevators to the ground floor. Hopefully they'll have it all sorted it in a few weeks. We were placed in the old wing. The corridor on our floor needs new carpets. Doors to service areas along our floor really need to be replaced as well. Our room though was newly refurbished. A lot of wood veneer was used, so to me it looked like start-up office furniture. It was clean though. The two beds hardly qualified as double beds but it was new and as such comfortable enough. The t&b was really very basic. The toilet was new but looked it was 2 notches above the manufacturer's cheapest model. Internet and 2 water bottles a day were free. Breakfast Buffet was part of the package. It was fine but very basic. However, what makes me recommend this Hotel would be the great service and the location. Service -- Everyone at the Concierge Desk, whoever was on duty, went out of their way to make sure that all our queries were answered and our needs met. From recommendations on where to go, where to eat, how to go, to directions and reservations to places and restaurants, to getting tickets to Universal Studio, to rebooking our flights, the Concierge Desk took care of us. The waitresses at the restaurant where we had our breakfast were all very nice and helpful as well. Location -- Across the street is Chijmes, across the other street is the Raffles Hotel, and on the other is an entire complex full of bookstores (forgot the name). Their is also a Catholic Church across the street on yet another side of the Hotel. The nearest MRT station is less than 10 minutes walk (access is via the Mall which is also right across the street). Since we were in Singapore for leisure, we spent most of our time away from the Hotel.

I looked online for rates, and when I found that the Carlton was available for SGD256++ per night, I called the hotel's reservations desk to book. However, I was told that the rates and room I had looked up were no longer available, and they offered me one at SGD340++, with no corporate rates. Unconvinced, I went back online and finally booked thorough a booking site, which gave me a rate of SGD299 and a bit (nett) for room + broadband, without breakfast (additional SGD20++). I opted out for breakfast as I am more the sort to grab brekkie on-the-go. It was also fortunate that I hadn't bothered, as upon walking out to the convention centre the next morning, I found the breakfast service full, with guests queued up waiting for tables. As a single, female traveller, I was extremely surprised to see that they had given me a room at the very end of the corridor! Perhaps this was a result of booking through external online sites, but I must say I have never encountered this with other hotels I've booked via the same site. I've always been given rooms closer to the elevator lobbies. The hotel was very clean. The hotel itself is rather old, I think, as evidenced by the fixed ID (eg. the bathroom, marble in the common areas, overall design, etc.) but effort certainly has been made to keep the hotel updated. It felt light, clean & fresh. The bed was comfortable, the linen and draperies were clean & dust-free, and despite what was obviously an \"old\" bathroom, I have never seen a cleaner one. The grouting was spotlessly white. For strictly business travelling purposes, the hotel was adequate. It was a clean, comfortable, quiet place to return to and rest at the end of a busy day. However, I was rather upset with their front desk staff, and judging from the number of other guests talking rather forcefully at the front desk, I wasn't the only one. Upon check-in, I REPEATEDLY advised the clerk that I wished to pay the bill by cash, and NOT via the credit card I used to secure the room, so that it would be quicker for me to process my own accounts later. I asked if they wanted it paid up in full up-front, or later upon check-out. They advised me that payment only needed to be made upon check-out, but that they needed a deposit from me upon check-in, against accidental damages, which I thought was fair. However, upon check-out, they happily returned the cash to me and smiled me away. It turns out that despite my bugging them repeatedly about remembering that it was to be a CASH payment, they had charged it to the credit card UPON CHECK-IN anyway. I was quite upset with that, and had words with the duty manager. However, they insisted that nothing could be done to reverse the charges. The problem is that despite being an English-speaking nation, the front desk staff seem to have a poor grasp for UNDERSTANDING what was being said to them in English. Upon check-in, I spoke to no less that THREE people, the final one being the senior personnel in charge, who, as it turns out, STILL had not understood my request for cash payment! How difficult can that instruction be? Similarly, upon check-out, I also had to speak to THREE people before I received a clear explaination, ending with an irate conversation with the duty manager. I suppose if you do not intend to come into contact at all with the service staff, then you shouldn't have many problems with staying at the Carlton. Location-wise, it is two blocks down (7 minutes walk) to Suntec, and pretty much 10 mins by cab to the CDB, Orchard Road or Clarke Quay.

It also meant we had breakfast, drinks during the day and evening cocktails included, together with a limited amount of free laundry. It seemed that rather a lot of people stayed in a Premier Club Room as the executive lounge could get quite crowded. The service did not seem as good in the executive lounge as in the rest of the hotel. Also, there were a lot of people there on business and they tended to sit in the lounge in the evening with their laptops or had meetings in there. This meant that those of us there on holiday often found it difficult to find somewhere to sit. If the hotel wants to promote their Club Rooms they definitely need a bigger executive lounge.

They were not fresh stains, and the sheets were washed, however they were blood stains. Someone else's blood stains. Luckily since my wife and I were traveling together, the company we work for, provide us with our own room. Having 2 room allow us the opportunity to change rooms incase either one of us snores to loud. lol. Back to the stain. We immediately called the front desk and asked to have our bed sheets changed due to the bloodstain. We received a not so sympathetic apology and a will send someone to change the bed sheet. Since we had another room, and from previous experience on waiting for service we decided to just change room and use the room as a snores escape. As we were moving our luggage and belonging to the other room, we noticed the chambermaid coming in our originally room with 1 bed sheet. As we get settled in to our second room, and we start to get ready for bed....dejavu now the second room bed sheet also has a whitish/cream dry/crusty stain. Needless to say we immediately contacted the front desk and requested a different room on the same floor. However instead of an apology we received a \"I am sorry we have no other rooms available on the same floor\". At this point since we just wanted to go to bed, we asked to have the key brought up right away. A few minutes later we received the key to a room across the hall from our original room. Our new room had clean sheets and finally we were able to go to sleep by 2:45am. Leaving our room about 10am, we noticed the chambermaid cleaning the rooms on our floor. Arriving to the hotel by 4pm we checked our second room to see if they had changed the bed sheet and much to our surprise they had not. They did made up the bed, but they did not change the stained sheet. I wish I could say this was the first time this had happened to me at this hotel, but unfortunately the same issue had happened about 3 years ago. In that instance it took about :45 minutes for the chambermaid to come change my bed sheet.

It was a nice place and I've definitely stayed in much much worse as I tend to go cheap, but I do not think it was worth it for the price. Don't get me wrong, it was nice, just not nice enough for what they charge, although Singapore as a whole is overly inflated in prices. I would say it is comparable to an a Ramada Inn back or a little higher hotel, but where I would pay about $80 a night for something like that in the U.S., we paid $110 a night with a double discount. Add in that there was no meal included, not even a bad continental breakfast, and no free internet or business center, it was quite expensive for what it was. Having said that, the staff was super friendly and helpful, and even advised us against using the business center and instead directed us to the much cheaper internet cafe around the corner. It is a great location though, within walking distance of Orchard Road shopping, yet allowing you to not be in the massive hub-bub of it all, and the restaurants around it are cheaper (even McDonald's) than the ones on Orchard Road.

Pool bar is open til 8pm and food is available there as well. - Bed was large and comfy. - Room came equipped with a converter plug. - Staff working front door and lobby are very polite. cons: - For the first week, every day I moved the comfy chair by the desk where I used the internet and every day the cleaning staff moved it back across the room. She finally caught on after a week and stopped moving it. - On Mondays I would receive a plate, a knife, a fork, a napkin. I would eat some bread off of the plate on Tuesday mornings and then the plate and cutlery would be taken away, not to reappear until the following Monday. - The business center is a racket. I am paying for the internet in my room on a daily basis, but to get something printed out in the business center, which required logging on to my email quickly, I was charged a dollar a minute! I hit print at a minute 30 and nothing happened. I waited another 20 seconds or so and then called to the staffperson. She came over and made something work on the printer. By this time I had been online for 2 and a half minutes. I said, \"so you'll just charge me for 2 minutes, right?\" She said, \"you were on for 2:40 and that rounds up to 3.\" I said, \"but the printer was not working.

Normallly the breakfast buffet costs $36. I received it for $20 as a long-term guest, but this still seemed like an awful lot. Food at the Chinese restaurant is $20-$40 for a single entree and is not geared toward the solo traveler. - Shower had mysterious issues. It would turn off after a minute or so of running. I discovered that letting it run for a minute and then either turning it off or letting it turn itself off and then turning it back on solved the problem. Agree with other reviewers that the bathrooms could use an upgrade. Lighting is also very poor in the bathroom and the mirror is bit off kilter. When I was plucking my eyebrows, I would think I had grasped a hair and I would not have it due to the mirror being wonky. - When I got a message on my TV from the concierge it said I had to call reception to get the light on the TV to stop blinking.

If you come out of the the hotel and right then right at the lights you will see 7-11 across the road where drinks are far cheaper. The breakfast was included in the room price and was very nice indeed, a selection of everything from boiled eggs to omelettes etc. We were not allowed to eat on the first day because we were not supposed to check in before 2pm however they were kind enough to let us have the room immediately. On the last morning we left before the breakfast room was ready but they let us go in and help ourselves tobreads, pastries fruit and juice which I thought was good of them - but then we had paid for breakfast for this day! The room was spacious even with the 3 quite large single beds. The linen was crisp and clean and the beds were made and room cleaned everyday that we were there. We were on the 10th floor and view was very nice and we did not hear any of the work that has been discussed on this site, unless we went outside. There is a small swimming pool on the 5th floor with sunbeds but we did not use it although it was quite peaceful there. This hotel is excellent for its position in singapore. Immediately across the road is the Chijmes food complex. We went to carnivores as many people on here have mentioned it. However, we were not impressed as it was fairly pricey for what it was. Chefs come round with skewers of meat and you turn you table mat to green if you want some and red if you dont. Different meats come out at different intervals - mostly beef I found, but lamb, chicken and fish were all on offer. $45 dollars per head excluding drinks, 7% government tax and 10% service charge. It soon adds up. If you come out of the hotel and turn left, cross at the lights you will see Raffles Hotel. It was a wonderful colonial building for the rich and famous but a must see nevertheless. If you keep working right past it, you wil come to the Suncity Mall. In here you can buy a one or two day bus sightseeing tour, which offers hop on hop off options for the two days and you can use it much as you want until it stops running, it also offers a boat ride on the river which was very pleasant. I think was paid about $25 for the two days, but it was well worth it as we got to see everything including orchard road where you could get off if you had brought your mortgage money with you!!! There is plenty to see however this country is very expensive indeed. The \"theme park\" (sorry i cant remember the name of it) is an absolute rip off. You pay a couple of dollars to get in then pay the the ride, each one between 15 and 29 dollars per ride or \u00a36 and \u00a314. We walked in and walked out! Sinagpore as a country has no culture of its own and I found this very disappointing - It is just new everywhere or being built. There is this feeling of rushing, very much as in London and I found it stressful and couldn't wait to leave. The Carlton however, is a great place to rest your head at the end of a busy day sightseeing. My only disappointment with the carlton was that when I came to leave the price quoted for the extra bed did not include 10% service charge and 7% government tax.

The hotel didn't provide 3 sets of towels or coffee supplies though even after putting the extra bed in there, we had to ask for this to be done. There was just a general feeling of disorganisation in the hotel which wasn't there the first time we stayed. The hotel is currently having an extra wing added so there was a lot of construction work going on which made sitting by the pool less relaxing than it should have been. Luckily we couldn't hear it from our 18th floor room that much, but we could hear the lifts all night which was a bit of a pain. You would be best to ask for a room away from the lift area and high up enough not to be disturbed by the construction work. The all you can eat buffet breakfast was great again, S$20 if you book when you check in but S$35 if you try and arrange it after that. We weren't told that on check in so were charged the higher rate for the first morning but reception quickly changed that for us when we explained. The best thing about this hotel is the location. You're round the corner from Raffles hotel, 5 minutes from the MRT which is a really clean and easy (and cheap) way to get wherever you need to go in the city, and maybe 10 minutes walk from Clarke Quay where you can get a decent meal for around S$10 (the beer is a little more expensive than we're used to but that's not a bad thing in that heat!). It is also clean and as I say, however disorganised things seemed to be, the staff were always at least trying their hardest to help and very friendly which makes a big difference of course.

Worst of all, they do not provide free toothbrush and toothpaste! I bought it via housekeeping at SGD$1.50. And the room service is very slow.

Hotel looked good upon arrival, great location, nice lobby and decor. However, I was immediately put off by the young lady who checked me in. I felt she treated my three colleagues and I like little children on a holiday by ourselves, instead of the business travellers that we actually were (despite us dressed in our work clothes). Also, I was made to feel like I was a burden to her, especially when I asked for a king bed (which I had already booked), but due to availability, was given a twin room. That would've been fine, only my colleague who then checked in after me got a king bedroom. I accept that this happens, but it doesn't help that the man who served my colleague was much nicer than the lady who served me. A few other things: We ordered room service the following night and the man who answered the phone sounded irritated and got our orders wrong. He also hung up the phone before we did, although we had already said that was all. I'm a firm believer that when you're on the phone to a client or customer, you should wait until they hang up as the last thing they want to hear is you slamming the phone down. We also went to the business centre to borrow their phone conferencing facilities, which unfortunately they had none. A few other details here and there, such as my getting a poorer quality bedroom with an empty minibar and fewer room facilities despite paying the same price as my colleagues, and other things which overall left me with a less than pleasant impression of what should've been a good stay at what I believe is a 4-star business hotel. I've stayed at the Pan Pacific at Marina Square, which is fabulous, but I can't believe that the difference in service levels between that and Carlton is huge. Also, immediately after checking out of Carlton, I checked into Furama City Centre where I would be staying for the weekend, just to see if it was common to find that service level among non-5-star hotels. Apparently, that's not the case (I've left a review for the other hotel as well). All in all, my colleagues and I weren't very thrilled with our stay.

Location is great, so instead select hotels in the same locality but with better rooms, ambience, more services & FINALLY lower rates than carlton. Try Inter-continental(cheaper by 100 S$ & amazing colonial atmospheric building), Allson (next door)..anything but don't waste your money on Carlton. Carlton has a stunning lobby to impress the visitor in the first go & good reception staff & concierge but the story ends there. You won't encounter technical problems but YOU DON\"T GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! Firstly, rooms are pathetic....they have a cold look. The furniture...can you believe it...is cheap light wood with metal. Toiletries (lousy brandless shampoo, bath gel , moisturiser & jst a soap) Carpeting is soiled throughout the hotel & rooms. Though initially we overlooked...but now we wonder why can't they change the carpeting (a hotel doing such good business can afford it). It sucks to pay a 4* price & get a 2* ambience. I must mention that carlton has gr8 tie-ups with airlines & tour companies because of which it is always packed & this is perhaps the reason why they are successful with their mediocre infrastructure. The unsuspecting visitor hardly has much choice once he lands there & since one has enough to do at Singapore one usually chooses to overlook the inadequacies of the room. Look at our experience. We stayed for 7 days in end of Aug 2008 in a PREMIER ROOM on the 14th floor (on full tariff). Now what wud one expect from a premier room? {chek the pics] We were shocked at the mediocrity, but reconciled, thinking perhaps this is Singapore standard as this was our first visit. For seven days we didn't get a single complimentary bottle of water & even a newspaper. We thought maybe in S'pore hotels...it is not free. For 7-days we had the same Breakfast. The variety was extensive but honestly, the taste or cooking of the meals was very average. The oil used for making eggs seemed stale. The fruits were cut in huge pieces, the sausages were bland & i can go on. What excites you about the b/f on the first look, soon fails once you start to taste it...& every item remains same each & every day. Now Bath. Out shower cubicle door did not close, we didn't complain. The hair dryer was in the room secured inside the writing table drawer (so have a bath in the bathrom & come around the room to dry your hair!!) There wasn't even a sofa in the room. The curtains were dated. The bed was QUEEN & not very soft. The TV hardly had many channels...except for one eng music & CNN channel..rest were local..that too some hardly around 18 channels. There was an old coffee maker inside the TV cabinet without the complete set of tea-coffee-sugar sachets for the whole of seven days. Twice we ordered room service but the food didn't taste well. Not stale but the chefs just aren't gr8 cooks! On our 8th day we left for a Star-Cruise & first thing we found on our cruise room were 3 complimentary bottles of water (which were replenished each day). These are small things but it makes a difference. When we returned, for the last day we booked Holiday Inn Park View Hotel near orchard road in front Istana Palace. We just had a standard room there but the luxury it rendered totally won our hearts. {see pics & compare it with carlton's premier room} Everything at Holiday-Inn-Park View was top-class...from red-earth toiletries, numerous towels, Bath robes, slippers, polished cutlery, extensive mini-bar, complimentary water & tea-coffee maker & even the rich crockery. The bed was huge & luxurious. The carpeting was spotless & the furniture was classy & all-deep-wood. Curtains expensive & bath good-quality marble. And GUESS WHAT: the tariff was S$ 100 lesser. The next day, the breakfast too was amazing, not as extensive as Carlton but everything cooked well with 4 choices for coffee. Now we even more realised what we were deprived off in Carlton!! We were disgusted that we wasted 7-days at Carlton & called them & complained about the services. They then confirmed that they do give complimentary water & newspaper & regretted that we weren't given any. Imagine this is the amount of attention they give to the services..which they never bothered to check during our stay. They said they'll make up for it...but now? after giving us a shoddy room & cold stay for 7 days. The staff is not bad but the offerings are not WORTH YOUR PENNY. We found many hotels nearby, much better...so pick one from them because for the purpose of exploration of the colonial district, this location is very good. So, all the best. Wish you all an atmospheric & cozy, warm & luxurious stay in one of the many other hotels nearby.

We had previously stayed at Furama RiverFront Singapore 3 years ago, which is Category A \u2013 so why it is that we had paid double the price this time for Category C and we got an experience comparable to a Category A? This hotel is in major need of an update. The rooms look and feel tired, especially the furnishings and finishings in the room and the bathroom. The location is relatively good, right across the road from the Raffles Hotel, Raffles City and is 2 blocks away from Suntec City. In the other direction 5 minutes walk takes you to the Le Meridien side of Orchard Road. Then 15 minutes in another direction takes you to Funan Digitalife Mall for all your IT needs. It sits on a busy road, so taxis are never a long wait. Right next door at the Raffles is also the Singapore Airlines Hop-on bus, provided for free to Singapore Airlines passengers taking the Stopover package. This stop caters for both the City loop and the Sentosa Island loop. I\u2019m not too sure about the distance to the nearest MRT station, although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s no more than 5 minutes away. We were provided free transfers from Changi airport to the hotel in a mini-bus, and every hotel that we stopped at the bus could go into the hotel bay drop-off area. At Carlton the exit requires the vehicle to pass the carpark so the clearance for vehicles is very low. Thus we were dropped off on the street (a bus multi-lane road) with no porter facilities. First impressions were not good. The lobby itself is quite dark, and never enough lounge spaces for waiting. Though it seems there were a lots of Australians there, and the hotel always felt busy with people coming and going. There is an abundance of staff in the lobby, with always someone at least standing there waiting \u2013 be it bell staff, concierge staff, etc. On the right there is also a small souvenir store (don\u2019t buy there, it\u2019s expensive). Rooms feature a nice bay window area and very tall ceilings to facilitate better air conditioning (hot air rises). These are pretty much the only things positive about the room. It\u2019s not that it was dirty, its just that the rooms need a major facelift. There is grout in the tiled bathroom. The toilet is difficult to flush, light switches feel dated, colour scheme is very bland, single beds were comparatively small, the cupboard smelt damp, the list really does go on. Also, outside the window, the view of the pool was clear: grout in the tiling down there. At least the bed sheets were clean and sleeping was relatively comfortable. What also annoyed me was a sign saying that if you require a refill of the complimentary tea bags, it will cost you $SG4. It\u2019s just not something that you put in the hotel room - seems really stingy. Also, internet access will cost you $SG27 per 24 hours. That is also unreasonably high, especially when I\u2019ve just stayed in a 3 star hotel in Tokyo who has provided it for free. In the bar downstairs, $SG8 for a cup of coffee or tea. $SG8???? Even the Raffles doesn\u2019t even charge that much! I know for a fact (since I went there) Ah Dengs at Raffles costs $SG7.90 for Danish, tea/coffee and juice in the breakfast menu. A good thing about the Singapore Airlines stopover package is you get 50% off at Cafe Vic \u2013 the hotel\u2019s 24 hour restaurant featuring buffet\u2019s at most meal times. During our stay, buffet breakfast was $SG35++ and buffet dinner was $SG40++ \u2013 so we paid half of that per person. This made it an absolute bargain since dinner included crab soup, fresh seafood (prawns, oysters, Balmain bug, raw fish and sushi Japanese style), cooked foods (including mud crab, fish, pork spare ribs), salads and desserts (including Durian pudding, ice cream and a chocolate fountain). A chef can also freshly cooked you a prawn or bowl of noodles, and in the mornings you can get fresh eggs cooked to your liking, as well as Roti Prata, pancakes and waffles (though the chef didn\u2019t know how to use the waffle machine and ended up breaking it). Service was relatively flat, where no-one smiles at you and what happened to letting the guest walk first? Numerous occasions where I had to stop with a plate of food in my hands while staff just walked passed. I\u2019m also not impressed with the taxes and service charges hidden from the advertised price \u2013 makes it very deceptive! Would I recommend this hotel? If you are concerned about location, this hotel is excellent. But i could get the same hotel product elsewhere for much cheaper. Would I stay here again? Not really, for the point above. Singapore has very cheap taxis comparatively, it will cost you less than $SG10 from one end to another, so for me location is not that important. The product itself is much more important, and I did notice that the hotel is building a Premier Wing right next door to be completed in a few years time. Maybe after that is complete they will look at updating the hotel but until then, no thanks.

As a life long non-smoker I avoid the foul stench of tobacco whenever possible. So it was back to the original twin room, which I was assured was non-smoking. Of course, you can guess, it stank of cigarettes and so did the corridor. Perhaps it was the air-conditioning wafting the stink around, who knows. I suppose it was inevitable that if a hotel does not even realise they should establish your preference, then they are not going to be careful how the rooms smell. I see in an earlier response from the hotel that they think non-smoking should be on the booking, well sorry, but 80% of the world does not smoke, so it\u2019s the smokers who should be making special arrangements.

That was fine, but when we were checked in we were put in a smoking twin bed room at the arse end of the hotel. As we had requested a non-smoking king room, we went back to reception and said the room wasn't acceptable (it was really disgusting, as it reeked of stale cigarette smoke). We were then told that our type of room wouldn't be available until around the 2pm check in time, but we could remain in the smoking room til then. As we'd caught the red eye out of the Maldives, we were knackered, so we collapsed in the stinky smokers room for a few hours, as we had no energy to go shopping (which was the hotel reception's standard suggestion for killing time). After going back to reception at 2.30pm we were told that our room was still not available as the previous guests hadn't checked out, but should be available in a couple of hours after it had been changed over. So off we went for a while. When we returned to the hotel at 6pm, we thought surely we'd be able to check in now, but no, on rocking up to reception, we were told once again, that our room still wasn't available. At this point we were ropable as we'd been waiting 10 hours for our check in, and after having to call a supervisor and explain our dissatisfaction we were finally checked in. This wasn't a great start to our 7 day stay and certainly tainted our view of the hotel, but over the following days we did observe quite a few other frazzled guests who seemed to be having similar problems to ours. Breakfast was always an utterly chaotic experience, as the illusion was given of self-service, but when you did, you were bustled to another table, or stopped from helping yourself. The day before we left we asked for our bill and a 5am wake up call as our transfer pick up was at 6.30am and we wanted a good hour to organise our bags and then 30mins for breakfast. The wake up call never came, but fortunately we woke up at 5.55am and raced around gathering our things together before a very rushed 10min brekky.

It certainly doesn't offer 4 star service, and its staff seemed inadequately trained with some bizarre management systems in place that simply hinder their ability to provide good quality hospitality and service.

If I was paying so much at the Carlton, naturally I expect better. It was reassuring to find that the taxi I ask them to book for me was waiting there when I checked out, too many times I have booked a taxi at a hotel only to find they have no record of it, so credit the Carlton for being organized.

The Carlton Hotel is in a great location... so many of Sigapore's must-see destinations are withing easy walking distance (and I hate walking too much or too far!) - the fabulously colonial Raffles Hotel is just a 2 minute stroll away, Arab Street and Little India a little further - the temples, the best shopping like Bugis and Orchard Rd are all a stroll away. The Hotel itself is just great - what can I say? You enter and it's cool and marbely! :) There are always enough staff on duty to deal with the number of guests - so if you find yourself behind a group of 20 Japanese tourists who are checking in - as if by magic extra staff will appear. The room I stayed in had a great view - then again both sides of the building have. Cleanliness is my no. 1 priority when staying in hotels and the Carlton is spotless - the building is relatively new and the rooms smell lovely...not musty as some hotels in humid climates sometimes can The rooms are also well insulated - you know how it is when you're in Asia - sometimes you hear your neighbouring guests and they're not always quiet... next thing you know the telly is turned on, the kids jump on beds and you get no sleep. Not so at the Carlton - it's just great and quiet with just the subtle hum of the a/c. Negatively I will say that they always seemed to have many guests loitering in the lobby. I fund myself in this 'loitering' predicament too on my last day as I waited for my airport pick up - what I would suggest is that they create more seating in the lobby for those who are waiting to be collected on tours or by taxis to wait - the way it is now just looks untidy... All 5 star hotels are pretty much the same arent' they? All snapped out of the same mould it seems - but what sets each one apart is the quality of their staff. I loved the relaxed and friendly atmosphere here and the staff were very sincere in their greetings and chats. The poolside barman dried glasses and had a relaxed chat with me - no phoney American 'have a nice day!' here... I used to stay at the Allson Hotel every time I came through Singapore and it's by chance that I ended up at the Carlton due to the Allson being fully booked - however from now on I will always choose the Carlton and ensure I book well in advace.

The massive foyer area includes a lobby shop, lounge bar and a restaurant/cafe with a huge outdoor terrace where each morning's excellent buffet breakfast is served.

Orchard Road is also within walking distance, however, consider the MRT if you have several shopping bags in tow! My only complaint (and it's small) was that despite the abundance of staff servicing the breakfast area, getting them to attend to the tables to re-fill coffee etc took a lot longer than it should have.

I booked this hotel on what reviews were available back in Febuary. At that time the hotel was about 18 th on Trip Advisor and looked like a good deal for the cost,but I can see why it is slipping to an all time low. I too found many of the problems with staff and poor maintenance and house keeping. First off we arrived early evening and after requesting a non -smoking room back in Febuary was told that there were no non smoking rooms avaliable. I protested to no avail and was told if I was not happy with the room they would get house keeping to fumigate the room in the morning. We were in a hurry to get settled and go off to the Night Zoo(over rated ) we did not argue.The smell of smoke hit us as soon as we got out of the lift and yes the carpets looked stained from the constant cleaning. Our room was not too bad for smell so we went no further as we had better things to do than mess around changing rooms.I have to say the following night I got better treatment from the woman on reception and was given a 4hour late check out at no charge and without any fuss.Check in and check out was quite quick .Breakfast was what we expected plenty of choice with fresh pancakes and omelets . Yes the tea & coffee was a bit slow in coming yet they had a diningroom supervisor standing watching everyone but did nothing himself ??Yes it is handy to all the shopping but so too are twenty other hotels and with cabs only costing $7 to go most places (Zoo $20 )If you are staying in Singapore for any length of time stay at one of the top 15 hotels on Trip Advisor after that good luck .Best things we did.

The reception staff were rude, the catering staff were rude, the bar staff were rude.... Breakfast may state that it is served until 10.30, but we saw several people practically refused entry at 10am and nothing that ran out was replaced. We could not even get a re-fill on our cups of tea. After we signed for our breakfast we recieved two phone calls to the room to make sure that we had paid. We also requested an upgraded room as this was a very special trip for us - we too were given a standard room. But the best bit was that they gave us a twin room when were were on our honeymoon. When we asked to be moved we were made to feel that it was somehow our fault for this mistake. The rooms are now very dated and a lot of the switches and lights did not work. The concierge had very little knowledge of the surrounding area and could not even direct us to the nearest bus stop.

This was the 3rd stop of our honeymoon having just flown in from the wonderful Poppies in Ko Samui (- go there instead!) The difference in approach between the two hotels was striking. Despite it being booked as a honeymoon 15 months in advance, we arrived to find our 'deluxe' room had two single beds. The reception staff were not particularly helpful when called from the room and reluctant to do anything about it. We persisted despite our tiredness and it was only our insistance which surprisingly produced a room with a double bed on a club room floor. As with the reviewer below, this upgrade to club room level (room no bigger or better just on a higher floor) did not bring with it any advantages at all - this was discovered on attempted entry to the club room and I was made to feel like a second class citzen for that attempt. In addition, the supposed honeymoon extra's of fruit and flowers on arrival were not present, even in our original room. It took numerous phone calls to get these just out of principle. The standard of decor was a little tired, even in these supposed deluxe/club rooms and some of the tiling around the bottom of the bath needed attention as well as a leaky tap. The reception staff are still inattentive and not bothered about helping you swiftly - if you are going to Singapore for something special i.e. honeymoon, anniversary, do not go here despite it's great location, you will be made to feel like a small ant in a very big ant hill. They have too many rooms and guests to care about individuals. Food in restaurant is good but expensive, we had problems given such a short stay though to find somewhere close by that served breakfast during the week so were stuck for choices. The gym and pool facilities however were fine, particularly the pool - welcome break from a city.

Well we turn up again in two weeks and ask for the change - sorry very full, no can do but you can have one on a smoking floor? We said no would rather put up with single beds. Get to our room to find we have still been given the queen room on a smoking floor. Room is in terrible condition with no safe and not even mini bar (the fridge was empty!) and burn holes in the curtains. Figured a change of rooms was in the 'too hard' basket but then my husband tried to have a shower and the plug in the bathtub doesn't work and won't empty.
