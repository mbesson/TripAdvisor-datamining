It's a neighborhood (not so toursity) hotel with all the charm of Paris. We stayed on the top floor with double wide windows that we threw open for most of our stay. One nice thing about Paris, no insects, so no need for screens. The hotel is at the corner of two narrow streets that can be noisy at night. We slept through the noise with no problem, likely due to our heavy touring schedule and exhaustion at the end of the day; however, the charm of the busy small streets was not to be missed. The hotel was clean and well looked after. The rooms are small, but cozy in typical Parisian style. We had a full private bath with tub and shower and no complaints whatsoever. There is plenty of hot water available at any time. The hotel guests were quiet and a mixed crowd of all nationalities and customs. Though some here have mentioned being able to hear guests in other rooms, we encountered no such issue. We felt we had total privacy during our entire stay. The breakfasts are not to be missed, though there is no variation from day to day. You'll receive a brioche, a croissant and a pan au chocolade (bread with chocolate bits in it). All were fresh and delicious. Likely they come from the patissiere right around the corner every morning. You also have a choice of coffee, hot chocolate, hot tea or orange juice to drink. And feel free to bring along a fresh fruit from the market around the corner if you wish. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and managed to speak English acceptably. Since the neighborhood is non-touristy, you will find few English speakers. So either brush up on your French, or be prepared to use hand signals to get your point across. We were successful getting the next door restaurant prioprietor to cook our Steak Tartar rather than serve it raw just by flipping our hands over and over as if flipping a burger on the grill. He spoke no English at all, but understood and accommodated our request. The hotel had no air conditioning; most of Paris has no air conditioning. We had no need for it, though both of us prefer cooler temperatures. No air conditioning is a not to worry issue, particularly in the month of May. Even June should be fine. Free wi-fi internet access was generally OK. There were times when we seemed to lose our connection, though. You may want to purchase an electrical adapter after you arrive in Paris, to ensure it will fit in the wall sockets at the Mericourt. We found them available at a couple of shops within 5 blocks of the hotel. Just ask at the front desk and they will direct you to Darty, down the street. Or you will run into a couple of electronics stores along your walk to Darty. Either will meet your needs for US adapters. Be sure to plan plenty of time to take advantage of the numerous bakeries, butcher shope, outdoor market (Tues and Fri in the square a couple blocks away). There are numerous shops of all sorts within a block or within 10 blocks of the hotel, depending on how much you want to explore the area. A walk around the Oberkampf neighborhood is well worth the experience. As is typical in Paris, you can while away the hours at Chez Gaston or A La Folie in the same block as the hotel. Or you can enjoy other outdoor cafes anywhere within 10 blocks...or anywhere in Paris for that matter. If you like to eat outdoors, you will LOVE Paris. This neighborhood is IDEAL: for outdoor eating. Take your choice from among hundreds of outdoor cafes available within just a few blocks of the hotel. You'll take the Oberkampf metro stop from Hotel Mericourt to most tourist destinations throughout Paris. Get a week's pass in regions 1-3 of the metro, train and bus. This will be well worth the 20 or so Euro investment for unlimited travel to all the sites you will want to see. I would highly recommend the Hotel Mericourt to any visitor to Paris, particularly anyone that wants the real (non-tourist) Paris experience. We thouroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Mericourt and would return there if we ever visit Paris again.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sheffield", "Title": "\u201cGood value for Paris with breakfast thrown in!\u201d", "Author": "cerfblanc Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR111395576", "Content": "This is a small hotel in a trendy area of Paris with friendly staff and excellent value for money as continental breakfast is thrown in - orange juice, bread, jam, butter, croissant and pain au chocolat with decent coffee.

The rooms are of the size you would expect in big cities the world over ie small, with bath and shower en suite. A certain amount of refreshment of the decoration would be welcome, but the prices would be higher then. There was ample supply of hot water and the beds whilst not in their first youth were comfortable enough and clean. Although just off the rue Oberkampf, it was not noisy and we all slept well. The situation is good in that you can walk to most of the major attractions and it is about 25 minutes walk from the Gare du Nord where we arrived on the Eurostar. I go each year to Paris for the tennis at Roland Garros and spend little time in the hotel so aim for somewhere clean, quiet, comfortable and relatively cheap.

The room was small and not in perfect cosmetic condition (scuff marks and a few stains, a chipped tile or two), but the heating and bathroom worked perfectly. It had a hair dryer and closet, but no alarm clock or phone. We were able to walk almost everywhere we went in town from here. There are also several bus lines and Velib (bicycle rental) kiosks within walking distance. It is completely possible to reach the hotel from CDG airport by public transportation.
