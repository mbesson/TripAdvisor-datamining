Lincoln street is just around the corner, supermarket is really close. We stayed in an apartment with kitchen and one bedroom and it's really worth the price different. The apartment is small but have all that you need for your stay, washer and dryer are available in the hotel, as soft drinks. The staff is very helpful and will do all to improve your stay. As the hotel is designed as a motel in a U shape you can relax in the outside chairsDefinitely a good option considering the high prices in Miami.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location with big comfy rooms\u201d", "Author": "janewdc", "ReviewID": "UR125427451", "Content": "Hotel 18 is superbly located half a block from Collins St and the airport bus stop and 3 min walk from Washington St and Lincoln Rd so it's right in the heart of all the action in South Beach. Also it's a block and a half away from the beach. The hotel provides short and long term stays. Our room was in a corner and it was huge. It had a kitchen fully equipped with stove, microwave, dishes, pots, etc., a small dining table and a small fridge. There was plenty of storage space for clothes, the bed was comfortable. There is AC. The bathroom has a tub; toiletries and hair dryer are provided as well. The big windows have white panels beneath the curtains which is really helpful to keep a lot of light from entering the room in the mornings and helps keep the room cooler. Everything was very clean. Wi fi is included also. My only complaint and it's not really about the hotel but about the noise in the street which kept waking us up during the night. I guess that's what you get for the excellent location. It doesn't have a pool if that interests you, for us it wasn't important. In summary, great price, very clean and excellent location, what more could you ask?", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, ND", "Title": "\u201cVery clean, cheap, and close to the action (but not too close)\u201d", "Author": "exvine", "ReviewID": "UR125412443", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here one weekend in February and were very happy with our room. The lady at the front desk was very nice and even helped us with our bags. The hotel room is a tiny studio apartment complete with a kitchen. Everything was very clean. The local bus stop is only a block away (which you can ride for only 25 cents!). Lincoln Road Mall is a short walk south, so it's easy to get to the action, but the hotel is quiet, so you can actually sleep at night. South Beach is absolutely beautiful! It was a great trip and I would recommend this hotel if you are ok with a very basic (but clean) set up. No pool, hot tub, or breakfast, but if you want a good breakfast, hop on the bus and go down to 8th and eat on the patio at News Cafe...good breakfast and fun people watching!", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cOk stay - good location but noisy\u201d", "Author": "Icefloat", "ReviewID": "UR124783859", "Content": "Stayed in the 1-bedroom apartment for a long weekend in February. Hotel has very reasonable prices, and the apartment is a good choice when 3 adults travel. The apartment was clean and comfortable, even the futon in the living room was comfy. Bathroom is small but adequate; kitchen has all the basics. Location is great, walking distance to Lincoln Road, Collins Ave etc. Only minus point, and a big one, comes from the noisy atmosphere; lots of people like to congregate in the outside patio area or outside the rooms, which makes sleeping very difficult for the one sleeping on the futon in the living room. Hotel is easily accessible by the airport bus, there are a few parking spots right outside as well. Would recommend but do bring ear plugs!", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waldorf, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cClean, friendly motel stay\u201d", "Author": "Rose M", "ReviewID": "UR122882325", "Content": "Really loved this place. I found this motel online and that is sometimes worrisome because when you arrive it may not be what you thought it would be, but this place was really clean, quaint and located nicely.
