We thought that it was an ideal location to all the sites, as it is right on the Rambla, so just a couple of blocks down the road is the Placa de Catalunya. We stumbled across the Casa Mila which is right behind the hotel, so it's great if you want to get up early in the morning to queue to see that. The rooms are very large with a nice balcony looking over the street. They were also very clean and had it's own bike machine. One problem though was that it got very hot and stuffy in the rooms and we ended up with very dry mouths in the morning! The breakfast was disappointing as there was only cold food on the buffet like salami and cheese, and wasn't really enough to keep us going the whole day. Cooked food had to be ordered for an extra charge. Also slightly odd because the rooms were really modern but the rest of the hotel seemed a bit dated and needed an uplift. It would have been nice if the swimming pool was open in the Spring as the views from the roof would have probably been pretty cool. Staff were very friendly and helpful and would show you directions to landmarks, and phoned up taxis for you, and helped us when we needed to print out our boarding passes on the way back.

The nearest metro stop is the Passeig de Gracia, which also has suburban trains stopping there, so you can get to and from the airport direct without having to change. Perfect! On our arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the gentleman on reception. He upgraded us from a standard double to a superior double, for no extra cost. Our room was on the first floor and had obviously been improved recently and looked onto the Rambla de Catalunya. I was worried about it being too noisy to sleep, but very little street noise could be heard. Both the room and bathroom were really clean and we could find no fault. Breakfast was a buffet affair, with plenty of choice. Tables are VERY close together and staff were a little thin on the ground. We were told that a hot breakfast was available, but this was not obvious when in the breakfast room. Having said that, we had more than enough choice. On checking out, we asked the receptionist a question regarding the 3 day travel ticket we had purchased. She didn't know the answer, but she quickly checked the appropriate website and then phoned someone.

The Reception staff are excellent and helped us out with some missing football tickets that we had delivered to the hotel.

Unfortunately it did not. Apart from a few stained glass windows dotted around, there was nothing interesting about the hotel. The decor in the hotel generally was bland and, after looking through the door we didn't even go into the bar. The bedroom on the 7th floor, although having a view towards the mountains, was quite small and very average. The ceiling needed painting and the whole room could have done with some redecoration. The bathroom was adequate and clean, although the towels were often very thin, and I discarded a number daily in an effort to find some better ones, something I don't normally like to do. There was wi-fi in the bedroom but the code had to be renewed every two days. Trying to use it early in the morning sometimes required me to dress and go to reception for a new code and password. Perhaps another system could be devised so that guests had access to the internet for the duration of their stay, without having to keep renewing. The good thing about this hotel was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, who answered all our questions knowledgably and tried their best to help, even though there seemed to be a lack of staff in the dining room at times.

On a 10-day trip in Spain with the last 2 days in Barcelona, we picked this hotel because of the location and the generally positive reviews posted here. And thus far our experience has been nothing but TERRIBLE. We checked in at 8 PM and got what is probably *the worst* room in the hotel - Room 401. 1) The room overlooks an elevator shaft or some other shaft on the interior of the building, which probably has a drain opening somewhere. The view from our room consists of a bare wall with metal pipes and the stench of a dead otter. (Another review has specifically commented on this room as well). Fine, I can understand that not each room will have a view, and we're willing to settle on this. 2) The AC does not work, and the room feels like the inside of a marathon runner's shoe. Being a Sunday, the staff refuses to do anything except call the service engineer tomorrow. When I asked \"what about tonight? How do we sleep in this heat?\", the response was - \"Well, it's not like this is summer. The weather is good outside. You can sleep\". Yes, I would even be willing to sleep with the windows open if that damn shaft didn't stink like a dead otter. 3) The electronic lock on the main door malfunctioned, locking us out for 30 minutes. The receptionist called the security guard, who was generally helpful and let us in, but again \"We will call the service engineer tomorrow\". Yes, this is all in the first 4 hours of being in this hotel. I don't know what else to look forward to.

The staff were friendly and helpful, and, on the desk, English speaking. (In fact, throughout the city we found restaurant staff etc. to be very amiable in dealing with non-Spanish speaking Brits.) We were given rooms opening on to the internal shaft, but put up with it for the sake of the absence of noise. Apart from someone banging about for a short period one night, it was peaceful even with the window open. The aircon was fairly unobtrusive at low level, and the temperature comfortable despite the warmth outside (even in October). The rooms and bathrooms were clean, of decent size and comfortable. We had an Airmiles 3 nights for 2 deal with breakfast thrown in, so it all seemed pretty good value: the breakfast was very good with lots of choice. One minor quibble: the coffee came out in jugs with just a flap on top and lost heat quickly, so if you want your coffee really hot, pounce on a fresh jug. The terrace bar and pool (which is tiny) were closed, but it was worth making our way up to the roof for a look at the views. And there was a vending machine if you are desperate for a soft drink. There are plenty of eating places in the centre strip of the Ramblas within staggering distance of the hotel, and we tried one out one evening when too tired and hungry to go further. It was expensive and, to be kind, mediocre; perhaps we were just unlucky. We did much better in the Gothic Quarter with two higher quality and cheaper dinners and a good tapas lunch at three separate places. But it's a bit of a walk from the hotel, and you may find yourself wandering round a maze of medieval streets at night. We found the the Gaudi \"temple\" wonderful, including a slightly scary descent from a tower by foot (you can take the lift). But, my dear, the noise and the people!

The hotel is ideally located on the Rambla de Catalunya, minutes walk from the famous Ramblas and market, enshrouded in wonderful shops, and again a stones throw from the famous shopping malls and areas of Barcelona. To top it all, take a hop on hop off tour of Barcelona on an open top bus to get your bearings and take it from there - HCC is again just minutes away from the main tourbus stops !! So its all about location here. The hotel is a nice,warm place, rooms far from ultramodern but there's space enough in them and the premises and rooms are kept spotless. The room rates are very competitive, especially if you take how much you save on taxis etc., into consideration. Staff are very attentive and helpful, always willing to assist with questions, directions, recommendations and ticket reservations. Take into consideration that reserving tickets (tourbus, flamenco shows etc.) at the hotel can save you a couple of Euros too ! Downsides - well we chose bed only basis as breakfast in the region of 20 Euro per person seemed a little steep. Again, the hotel is located amongst a myriad of tea/coffee restaurants etc., so you will easily find a good breakfast close by - considerably cheaper. I recommend the Mauri teashop - a 5 minute walk away - fresh sandwiches, cakes, coffee, hot chocolate, lunch etc.etc. in a great atmosphere - but dont touch the food before you pay - there's a woman there who I think is the famous Seinfeld Soup Nazi's aunt who will tut tut at you and almost say \"no cake for you !\" if you just dare touch her puffed pastries before paying !!!

Samuel Johnson wrote \"[ \"When a man is tired of London he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.\" and that is equally true of Barcelona. So to those thinking about it -just do it , you wont be disappointed Prices have increased about 20per cent on last year so to cut costs dont eat in touristy areas.Try the upper end of Rambla Catalunya and the side streets. Dont book a taxi from one of the online transfer companies. A return transfer is roughly \u00a380 A fare from the airport by black and yellow taxi is about 30 euros so return is 60 approx \u00a360 This hotel is approx 15 min walk from Plaza Catalyuna where the airport bus stops and picks up-a cheaper alternative.

We had 602 and 603. Two clean and comfortably rooms with exellent bath and a big terrasse overlooking the city. Well, there is rooms at the hotel facing shafts and backyard-walls, but we were assured, that if you should get such a room at arrival they would transfer you to a better room as soon as possible. But those rooms are far from romantic! There is no restaurant but a very fine breakfastlounge. Breakfast is not overwealming, but there is what you need. Eggs, bacon, sausages etc. are served if you only ask for it and there sure is a lot of cake (we're not used to that in DK). Of course coffie, juice, different fruit etc. We didn't visit the bar downstairs but only the top floor (8th) bar and pool.

At the reception they're doing everything to please you and I have to name Maria who is especially kind and helpful - and also one of the men but I don't remember his name (he was wearing glasses). They phone, make reservations and fix car-rental etc. for you and helps you in any way with a smile. At nighttime there also is a guard in the reception.

The room (708)was huge with the biggest outside terrace I have ever seen (about 15 x 15 feet in area). Sitting out there on an evening with the lights and fireworks was a dream. The rest of the hotel was great as well! The buffet breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice and the staff could not have been more helpful. We asked for a recommendation for our anniversary meal and were directed to the Cerveseria Catalana one block up to the left which had the best tapas we tasted all holiday.....so good we ate there twice!!!! The roof terrace and bar was also a lovely place to spend an hour or two relaxing after a hectic but wonderful day of sightseeing. Granted as the rest of the reviews point out, don't expect to be able to go for a swim in the pool as it is jacuzzi sized but to be honest we didn't miss it! The drinks are a little bit more expensive but compared to british prices still a good deal. The hotel location is brilliant as well. It it about a five minute walk (five blocks) from the Placa de Catalunya and the start of the Las Ramblas and the surrounding neighbourhood is one of the best and safest in the city. I would highly recommend jumping on the tourist buses that circle the major sights of the city as this is a great way to get oriented and to make sure you don't miss any of the major sights on your visit. Must sees: Parc Gruell (do this early morning if you can as it involves a lot of walking, mostly uphill) Nou Camp (even for the non football fan it is awesome) Bus tours on both the North and South routes Las Ramblas ensuring you stop into the market halfway down on your right as you are walking to the sea and the Barri Gotic which is off to your left on Las Ramblas.

The rooftop pool would have been great as it was warm and sunny when we stayed but unfortunately it was closed during February which we were not aware of.

It is situated at the top of La Ramblas and is very central for everything that you could wish to do in Barcelona. The square is a 5-10 minute walk away and from here you get the tourist buses which practically run all day, every day. The drinks in the hotel are expensive 12.20 euros for 2 diet cokes and 1 vodka. We didn't buy any more drinks from the hotel after that! The breakfast is continental and the only hot thing on offer is boiled eggs which are sometimes so cold they are tasteless. IF YOU WANT A HOT BREAKFAST, YOU HAVE TO ASK - IT IS INCLUDED IN THE PRICE. They do sausages, bacon and omelette - which we didn't find out about until our last day. The fruit cocktail is tinned and is not very nice. Also, the fruit juices that are served seem to be at room temperature. Sometimes they have ice beside the jugs so you can put some ice in to cool it down. It does take the staff some time to replenish the food, I asked for more tomatoes and cucumber and I waited at least 15 mins before it was brought out. Rooms are spacious enough, however, ours had a view of the fire escape so wasn't particularly picturesque, but we were only sleeping in it so it didn't matter. The staff are courteous and friendly, we asked for extra pillows and they were delivered within 5 minutes. They are also good at organising taxis for you and they do seem to go out of their way to smile, which is something that a lot of hotel staff seem to forget to do. Taxis are expensive when phoning them as they arrive with 3 or 4 euros on the meter. We ordered a taxi to take us to the water fountains - which are absolutely beautiful. It's an illuminated display with music and the show start from 9.00 until 11.00pm and are every 30 minutes. From the hotel, the taxi should be about 6 or 7 euros. The show is fantastic - AND IT IS FREE. There are lots of nice bistro type cafes in the area and they are a lot cheaper than further down La Ramblas. We tried THE ATTIC restaurant and had a lovely meal. Don't order your steak medium rare as it comes out RARE. I should have sent it back to be grilled for a few more minutes, but I was starving. My husband had the lamb and it looked - and tasted - delicious. It may be a bit pricier than the surrounding areas but it is a nice relaxed restaurant with good quality food on offer. If you're coming from Barcelona airport, the average cost of a taxi to this hotel is 25-30 euros. So it's much cheaper to arrange your own taxi than let the flight operator organise it. We were quoted 43 euros by one company. This is a very nice hotel, it's not too noisy at night, unlike La Ramblas where they are presently playing pan pipe music until at least midnight. It sounds okay when you are listening to it in the street, but I would imagine that after an hour or so that it would drive you demented!
