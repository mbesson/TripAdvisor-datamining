The room was unbelievably hot. The person showing me to the room turned on the A/C for me, and an hour later the room was no cooler. I tried leaving the floor but at night they close the fire door to the stairway and elevator making it nearly impossible to find. Walking around and around I felt like I was going to start seeing \"redrum redrum!\" painted on the walls. It was really creepy! Turns out the door was inside another area that they open during the day. Not able to find the exit, I settled back in my room. Having had enough for the day I turned out the lights and tried to sleep. Somewhere in the middle of the night, with the air conditioner making a lot of noise but not reducing the temperature in the room, I turned on the light to go use the restroom. Suddenly everything in the room went silent and dark. I call down to the front desk to find out a fuse had blown in the room. Stumbling through the dark I find the fuse box conveniently located behind the door and the front desk walked me through fixing the problem. Woke-up the next morning to find bags of dirty linens stacked two and three deep down the hallway in front of the room. Also, when I checked in the night before they said they would have a room available for the next night, as I was leaving to go out for the day they inform me they did not have a room for the night.

It is a rather worn, 2-3 star property (depending on what you compare it to), but all in all rather OK by Italian standards, and especially for Rome. The rest: Location is good, depending on what you want to be close to, lots of shopping venues and caf\u00e9s along Via Nazionale. Rooms are nice, a bit shabby, but reasonably clean and spacious, and except for a rather nasty bed spread (again, normal by Italian standards) and some chipped and worn furniture, no complaints. Breakfast much better than average in Italy/Southern Europe, lots to choose from and even fresh fruit daily (although orange cordial instead of juice, but again, that is pretty normal in the area). Housekeeping was thorough. Some members of reception staff very nice, some very rude. So all in all, good value for money if you get a good rate and just want an OK room in a good location to lay your head whilst in Rome. If you're after comfort and pampering and super clean modern facilities then give it a miss (but expect to pay a lot more). Our experience: My husband was bitten by a bed bug/wall louse in the middle of the night, which caused some pain and a considerable swelling of his shoulder area. He caught and killed the bug, and went down to reception to report incident and ask for another room. Reception staff was sympathetic, but offered no more than clean sheets, and we had to change the linens ourselves in the middle of the night - NOT ideal. The lady in the reception the next morning was very rude but eventually we got a new room, and thorough cleaning by housekeeping. The manager assured that it was a one off, and also compensated for one night's stay and offered a dinner at a nearby restaurant, so all in all, the situation was handled well, eventually. If it hadn't been for the bite, we'd probably stay here again (and would probably have rated it a little higher), but as it is ... well ... probably not, but we wouldn't discourage others either, just be aware that if this happens to you, it was not a one off. If nobody else has the same experience (and we sincerely hope not!!), however, by all means stay here and enjoy. (Rating below is a little off, since it is a sort of mean between overall experience apart from the bed bug incident and the incident itself. Some staff members behaved admirably and some were rude, sleep quality was very good on all the preceding nights, but obviously horrendous on the night in question and not very good after, cleanliness by and large was good and well above average, but then again, the bug had to come from somewhere ... but we've tried to be as fair as we can, considering.)", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSo disappointed by the way we were treated.\u201d", "Author": "sandylarge", "ReviewID": "UR110803537", "Content": "This hotel is in a fabulous location.

It would be perfectly fine for a couple, and I would even suggest that anything more than this hotel would just be a waste of money. One drawback that I could potentially see is the room we were in was located directly next to the breakfast room, which would have been very bad if we had wanted to sleep in - fortunately we were up early each day, so it didn't impact us, but that room particularly could have been a little noisy otherwise.

They contacted several hire car companies for us but it some became apparent that we wouldn't be able to take a hire car out of Italy - many people had the same idea. They checked train and bus websites and priced a number of taxi and minbus firms. They went beyond what most hotels would do for guests and from talking to other people from other hotels we were most definitely well looked after. Would highly receommend this hotel to anyone.

The bathroom was again spotless, the only issue we had was it could be a little tricky using the shower due to the 3/4 size bathtub it was housed in, but this was a minor issue. Breakfast was taken on the 5th floor, it could get crowded at times but tables always became free pretty quickly, breakfast included cereals, juice, cheeses, ham, yoghurts pastries & croissants, coffee & teas, all in all perfectly adequate to start the day. Mario on reception was superb, totally efficient & very helpful with our requests, rearranged our transportation at short notice did it all with a smile, thank you Mario. All the major attractions are within walking distance from the hotel, the area is very safe most romans are polite & courteous to lost tourists invading their space.

The room had excellent A/C, double windows keeping out the noise, and a hard bed which is a matter of taste - we liked it. There's a color TV but all channels are in Italian (they don't use subtitles, even foreign films are dubbed). The ensuite bathroom, however, totally ruined the fun. First of all, the light inside the bathroom is on a timer. There's some kind of sensor in there, and after a few minutes the light just stops! There's another light which you can turn on, if you know you're supposed to do it, and it stays on (but the vent stops with the first light). It's not fun to start a shower and then be left in the dark. The tiny bathtub itself is a disaster, reminiscent of a medieval torture device. It is separated from the rest of the room by a glass screen door, getting in and out requires some athletic skill; and once you're in, you can't stand - this is because the floor of the tub is entirely concave, there's no straight surface to put your bare feet on - hard to describe, but very painful. If you're skinny and under 5 ft tall you can probably sit in it, otherwise there's no room for your legs. Absolutely terrible, especially when you're tired after a day of walking in the city.

Its location is perfect, very convenient if you want to see the major sites by foot (we only used the Metro once). We came prepared with a map but the the map the man at the hotel reception gave us was more detailed which was a great help. Hotel receptionists are very pleasant, helpful and speak English well (which is a bonus). We are greatly pleased with the hotel room, its cleanliness is at high standards. Nothing to complain about. The only downside is the TINY shower area, you really have to squeeze in to get in it, and I could hear quite clearly the other occupant's cough at the next room. The breakfast was quite adequate, very typical Italian (croissants, cold ham and cheese, cereal, etc.), though it could get a bit better. Hotel staff should realize that majority of hotel occupants are tourists from all over the world so there should be a lot more choices - a bit of bacon, sausages and toast won't hurt. If you want to know a nice place to eat in ask the hotel staff and take their word for it, they sure know what they're talking about. TIP: go to a ristorante/pizzeria where it says \"pizzeria forno a legno\" (baked in traditional wooden fire) and it won't disappoint you.

This December we decided to re-visit Rome.

Just prior to leaving, we received an email from a Rome based company who offered transport (at 70 Euros)from the airport to the hotel. We declined this invitation as we intended to use public transport(one of our 'things' when we go abroad is to use local facilities). However, a few days before leaving, I contacted the hotel and arranged direct with them, for transport from the airport to the hotel at a cost of 60 Euros(the bus fares would have been 48 Euros). The taxi driver met us as per arrangements and the transfer to the hotel took place. The hotel itself is set on one of the main roads that go thro' the city. It is a buzzing thoroughfare which adds to the delights of visiting this location. The reception given was, as before, warm and obliging.Our rooms were not overly large but were adequatef or what we needed. The bed was extremely comfortable and cleanliness was of the highest order. Breakfast was adequate and met with the description given on the booking. If you are looking for a large hot breakfast, this is not the place to visit. But for an adequate and well presented continental breakfast , with a range of breads, meats, cheese etc, it was all that we required. The reception staff were, as always, extremely helpful with providing information concerning tours and eating places. We visited two resturants that we found on our last visit. Ristorante Quirino is excellent to celebrate a special occasion. A visit to the Vatican was a must and on this occasion the audiance with the Pope was held inside in the large hall. Access to the hall is gained by requesting entrance tickets from the Swiss guards who have handfuls to pass out (free). On our departure, we used the hotel taxi service which cost 50 Euros(why the difference I have no idea).

Loads of good restaurants within a short stroll but the little gem was about 300 metres away, across the road and down the sidestreet that has the Timberland shop on the corner. It was called Angelo di Napoli. Had the feel of a family run restaurant, excellent food and wine and very reasonable prices. Closer and slightly more expensive was Zeus, another good restaurant. Rome itself was brilliant, we spent 5 days sightseeing, saw as many of the sights as we could. DON'T take a taxi from the station to the hotel, it's no more than a 6 or 7 minute walk. There are police everywhere in Rome so walking even if you arrive at night should be OK. Take a red open top tour bus to see the sights, they run every 15 or 20 mins and stop at all the main attractions, you can hop on and off as many times as you want during the day. It will save blisters. There is a green bus that goes out of town to the catacombs and aquaduct as well as many other sights. Both run from the bus station at the front of the Terminii Station. Other tips ? Take a larger suitcase than you need. The value and quality in mens suits, shirts, ties and overcoats is excellent.

Hotel is fairly close to the main train station so once we arrived in on the train from the airport (on the Leonardo Express, direct in 30 mins), we decided to walk to the hotel. Best option I felt if you have a relatively decent map to hand as it is only a 10-15 minute walk from the station and heard some stories about the taxis trying to charge extortionate prices to tourists. Room was OK as it had the necessities (double bed, wardrobes, safe, fridge, bathroom) but can see what some people have said about it being small. We thought it was ideal for what we were after as we weren't planning on spending a great deal of time in the room anyway. That aside, it was perfectly spotless and cleaned thoroughly with fresh sheets awaiting our return each day...suitably impressed to leave a good tip at the end of our stay for the cleaners. We were on the 4th floor overlooking the road and when the windows are closed, no noise was heard at all from the busy road below. Of course when the window was opened though, this all changed but again, that didn't bother us as we slept with the window closed and only opened it when we came back in of an evening to allow some fresh air in before heading back out again. Bathroom was decent with a fantastic shower which was lovely and warm and very inviting to jump into after a hard day of sightseeing. Breakfast was adequate with the standard selection of pastries, cereals and rolls and we certainly had plenty to keep us going for the morning.

We were in room 529 on 5th floor and faced away from the road (so no traffic noise which I think you could expect if you were facing the busy road). Took the Leonardo Express train from the airport into Rome Termini station, costing 11E. The worst part of our stay was being charged 25E in a taxi to get from the station to the hotel. Our fault for not querying it at the time, but you don't know when you first arrive. It wasn't until we got a taxi back on our last day and we were charged 8E that we felt ripped off!! Room fairly small but has everything you need, except tea and coffee making facilities. Safe was very useful. Bathroom fine, even had a bidet. Breakfast was fine, tea/coffee, pastries, brioche, ham and cheese, cereals. All self-service. Never had a problem getting a table and we went at differnt times each day. Hotel is in a great location. About 15mins to the Colosseum. Had a great time here. Had a guided tour with a company who stand around the entrance. This was well worth it, costs 21E each instead of 11E and you get a 45min tour and you get to by-pass thye HUGE queue. The ticket also included guided tour of the Roman Forum and Palatine but this didn't start until about 2hours after we'd finished at the Colosseum, so we just went on by ourselves. Everywhere is within walking distance, as long as you don't mind lengthy walks. After the Colosseum we went to the Tomb of the Lost Soldier and Piazza Venetia, the Pantheon (free entry), Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, along to the river, up to Piazza del Popolo, then the Pincio park and finally Spanish steps and then back to the hotel! Possibly not in this order, but you can see it is all do-able. Had a fab meal at Il Brillo Parlant on Via della Fontanella near Piazza del Popolo - great pizzas. Pizza and lasagne at Cavona on Piazza del Popolo were also good. Another great meal was at Cucina on Via Nazionale (walk left out of the hotel and it's on the other side of the road near Piazza Republica). Irish bar opposite hotel was also good. We spent a day doing the Vatican area. On Wednesdays you can go to the Papal audience,a good experience. Be aware that the Museums close at 1.45pm (last entry at 12.40pm), entry was 13E each. Had to queue about 40mins to get into St Peter's Basilica but it was worth it. We walked pretty much everywhere, but we did get the tube to the Vatican. There is a Metro station at the end of Via Nazionale (turn left out of the hotel and walk straight down about 5mins). Point to note - Loads and loads of beggars, women on their own, women with children and adults with disabilities, all either on the floor or shaking their bowl under your nose. Also, at Termini station when using self-service ticket machine to go back to the airport we couldn't work out where to feed our notes into; a man appeared from nowhere and pointed to the correct slot; then when our change dropped down he appeared again and asked for money. We didn't give him any and he walked away and then chcked all the other change slots. Be warned! We never felt unsafe at any time of day or night, but you have to be sensible and have your wits about you - Have your bag across your tummy rather than on your back, keep purses/ wallets out of your pockets etc. Witnessed a very amusing scene near St Peter's - loads of men selling sunglasses or handbags, all interspersed down the street. Then all of sudden they were off, with about 20 handbags along each arm and running into all the side streets! They'd obviously heard sirens or something, so they clearly weren't selling their wares legally!!

(We were tired so decided to catch one, but realising the distance involved wish we spent the money elsewere!) We flew with Easyjet from Bristol who I can also recommend with their prompt service and friendly staff. As we flew into Ciampino we made use of the Terravision coach which costs \u00a39.50 per person return which for a 40 minute journey into the centre of Rome (drops you at Termini Train Station) was well worth it.

The hotel is wonderfully central for all the main sights and there are several restaurants right outside as well as a pharmacy and a fairly authentic Irish bar.

You have to leave your key with the front desk every time you leave the hotel which can be a pain but at least the key doesn't get lost. The doors to the floor are locked at night so we felt safe since we had teenagers staying in their own room. The elevator is tiny but generally there wasn't much wait for it, we often walked but were staying on the 5th floor so that got tiring after walking all day. The rooms were small but that was expected. They were very clean and we had no trouble with noise from other rooms or from the street (as long as the windows were closed). There is a decent sized safe in the room, we were able to put our laptop computer and several other small items in it. The a/c was helpful although the weather was awesome while we were there. The shower is very small, if you drop something you will pick it up later after you get out but the hot water worked really well. The continental breakfast is just that so don't expect big breakfast but if you like pastries, cereal, and coffee for breakfast theirs is as good as any. Every thing is in walking distance --some a long walk but the bus stop is right outside the hotel. Just be careful on the buses as apparently they are a pick pocketers favorite location. An older couple that was staying in the hotel got their money stolen on the bus. We always wore money belts and kept our group close together and stood away from strangers as much as is possible on the crowded bus. The front desk staff is friendly and helpful and speak English very well. We encountered 4 different people working the desk and all were helpful. We did get a dinner recommendation from one to go to a restaurant called Flavio that turned out not so good. It was a fair walk from the hotel and extremely expensive. The food was pretty good for Rome but they bring you stuff you didn't ask for and then when you get the bill it was outrageous so if they recommend that to you, be warned. The pizza place around the corner and across the street is ok, not too expensive and decent tasting for a quick bite. In general we were very disappointed with the Italian food in Rome. The only good Italian food place we ate at in Rome was taking a right out of the hotel, cross Via Nazionale at the corner and keep walking one block then turn right. I can't remember the name but the family was so nice and the food was really good and prices good too.

Breakfast was ok - enough choice - cereals, pastries, breads, ham, cheese, tea, coffee, orange juice, etc, etc - but the breakfast room was quite small so we had to queue for a table. No big deal really. What about the negatives? Well, there were a few. Road outside is very busy. Double glazing in the room is very effective but doesn't cut out all the noise. If you like a late afternoon snooze then this is a little annoying but I don't remember it keeping me awake at night. Our air-con unit was very noisey - would make an annoying tapping noise after being on for a while. This was particularly annoying during the night but no big deal. The worst thing was that the bed in our room was very, very hard. Now if you like a hard bed then that's fine, I don't so I woke up a few times in the night because of it. The rest of our party had hard beds to but not as bad as ours.

The hotel is in a prime location for access to all the sites in Rome in particular being a 15 min walk from the Colosseum and on the way you can see the Tomb of the unknown soldier, and the Forum. There is also a metro stop (Republica) at the top of the street which for \u20ac4 a day gives you unlimited use - we used this to get to the Vatican and also the Spanish Steps for a third time- when my feet wouldnt go any further!! The hotel itself was extremely well kept - our room was small but clean at all times and although we had a room overlooking the street it was the fourth floor so the noise didnt bother us . There is so much to see in Rome that little time is spent in the hotel anyway and therefore location is key. We also found the staff very friendly and helpful in particular Mario who pointed us in the right direction on numerous occasions. The breakfast was small but ample. We would certainly recommend this hotel for location alone and will stay again on our next stay in Rome. Rome itself is breathtaking - there is alot of walking, steps and queing!!!!!!!!! We would recommend that you take a tour of the Vatican Museums as although we thought we would do it ourselves it is huge and confusing - we took a tour with the Pegasus tour and the guide was excellant - taking us to the main attractions and telling very informative pieces of information and stories about the paintings and painters as we went along. We went to the museum in the morning and if we had not taken the tour the que would have been 3 hours - so money well spent!! Unfortunately St Peters was closed for the swearing in of the Swiss Guard and closings like this we were told happen now and again - so be sure to go early in your trip so you can go back as we did! It is an unforgetable city and we havent even touched on the food and wine - we found it was good value and did not fall foul of any expensive restaurants - although coke is \u20ac3.50 in most places and should be avoided!!

Good points: very clean, I'm particularly meticulous when it comes to noticing when cleaning has just been scooted over - and I could not find fault. the bathroom was as good as new. The location was very good and there were buses right outside to take you anywhere in rome, mostly direct. Take the 64 bus straight to the Vatican city. Remember to buy a 4 euro bus ticket daily which will allow you to travel anywhere. Average: breakfast, the detail said full breakfast but what we actually got was the typical continental breakfast. it was fine but average. we had a room overlooking the main road and you could hear the traffic but it was fine - if you go to a city like rome, you can't expect the tranquility of the countryside. One thing we did notice was the bed rumbled - don't laugh - it was actually the whole building when heavy buses went by - not sure how strong the foundations are but as it's terraced to the other buildings, it didn't bother us and was only noticed when you tuned into it. Summary: I would recommend this hotel for anybody wanting a city break with good value for money (we paid \u00a3300 for 3 nights) but if I came again, I would try another hotel so I could stay in another part of the city - just to try somewhere different.

The hotel had a great location (10/15 mins walk from some of the main sites). We had no trouble finding it walking from the Termini train station (at 1am). The staff were really friendly and the food (which has been complained about) was fine. There was a wide range of things eg cereal, pastries, bread, meat, cheese, yogurts, fruit juice, tea, coffee, hot choc etc. There is plenty and you can help yourself so it wil last you until lunch time. The rooms were very clean, and we were situated on the 5th floor next to the main road, which is busy but with our window closed you could hardly hear anything. There is also air conditioning in the room and a mini bar. The tv has sky and there are about 3 or 4 channels which are in english. I agree the rooms are small but to be honest - why do you need lots of space? If you are going to rome you should be out seeing the sites. Its not that bad - im sure you could swing a small cat! Once having checked out of the room you can keep your luggage in the reception area until you have to leave, which is really helpful. As for Rome itself i suggest the best way is for you to discover it yourself but the hotel provides a small map (which is great - better than the maps which open out to be bigger then you) which they mark the hotel on so you can find your way about. I would recommend the open top bus tours, which you can get from the Termini train station ( there is a stand outside where the buses are). Well worth while and for those who dont fancy the hour walk to the Vatican the bus drops off at each site then you can catch the next one. And finally - if you are travelling with Ryan Air and choose to get the Terravision coach (again good idea) you can buy tickets as soon as you arrive at Ciampino and where they drop you off at the Termini - there is a hotel opposite which has a timetable on the reception desk inside for your return coach.

It was just an average hotel that didn't have anything that really made it above average. We took the Leonardo Express train from the airport to the train station. Then walked to the hotel from the station. It was a short walk that only took 10 minutes. We went to check-in early on a Monday morning when we arrived in Rome and Mario was at the front desk. He was very nice and spoke good English. He told us the rooms were not ready so we just dropped off our luggage and had a go at Rome. Check-in was easy. Mario's English was good so he made it easy. We also asked questions and he had all the answers. He was very nice and helpful. The one thing I didn't like was we left our bags in the reception office (along with many other bags) because we were there so early before our room was ready, but the bags weren't tagged with our room # or anything. They just sat there waiting for us to come back and pick them up. Now as far as I know there was someone at the desk the whole time but I just felt uneasy thinking someone could just grab out bags with theirs and walk out if the person at the desk didn't remember who's bags they were. As for the rooms they are very small with tight quarters but manageable. There was a small elevator so you didn't have to carry your bags up the stairs. -Beds were the European firm uncomfortable beds. -The closet was a nice size with a few drawers. All the hangers were ones that must have come from clothing stores. -TV was 13\" and got BBC World news in English. Plus Sky Sports (I think). -Fridge with a mini bar and enough room to buy drinks from the supermarket right down the street. -Bathroom had the smallest shower I have ever seen. You really had to open the door if you dropped the soap. We never had any problems with hot water. The blow dryer was weak according to my wife. Everything else worked just fine. -Heat worked well in the room at night but seems cold during the day when we were in there. We did get some noise from the street but it never bothered me that much. You are right in Via Nazionale which is a nice drag with a lot of shops and places to eat. Plus there is a taxi stand in the plaza right down the street. We walked to everything except the Vatican. The breakfast was pretty basic. Rolls, spreads, fruit, yogurt, cereal, meats (cold cuts), cheeses, juices and coffee. I did get sick from the meat but I didn't hold that against them. Another point to know Hotel Miami asks that you drop off you big cumbersome room key every time you leave the hotel. This way you don't lose it. This was sort of annoying because the front door is locked at 8 so you need to ring the office to get buzzed in. There were a few occasions that there was no one there to answer the door so we had to wait 15-20 minutes to get in. That was really annoying. Overall we were happy with the Hotel Miami. They had a great rate (80 euros in Feb 05) for our stay and most of the reviews were good overall.

A great location with a bus stop that will take you to all the sites. A walk to Trevi fountain/Pantheon will take less than 20 minutes. The Miami Hotel is clean and breakfast is fine and for those who want more then eat out - there are hundreds of cafes etc I lost my luggage and the hotel staff were very helpful and called the airport on literally dozens of occasions - if you are unlucky enough to lose your luggage my advice would be to return to the airport and check the lost baggage rooms for yourself. Go to terminal C and there are at least 3 orphaned suitcase rooms. I would certainly stay here again - for the money and location then this is as good as it gets.", "Date": "September 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburg, CA", "Title": "\u201cMaybe Too Much Character?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2512769", "Content": "On the positive side, location is great. The subway station is about 5 minute walk away. The train station is only 15 minutes walk away. There are two buses that the typical tourist will use right on the same street as the hotel, one takes you to the Collessum, the other the vatican. Found the facilities to be very clean and they have used upgraded materials in the rooms (marble and tile). The staff at the front counter spoke English very well and they were helpful. The front counter person Mario (who I had read about in some many reviews) was on vacation during my stay. On the negative side rooms are not just small, some (at least the one I stayed in) are configured in a very unusual fashion. We had two beds, each only 3 feet wide. The room was about 7 feet wide and 20 feet long, with a semi divider separating the two bed areas. Thus only the person whose bed was in the area with the TV could watch the TV. Speaking of which, there was no English content TV channels among the channels shown (some other hotels featured a couple). There were a host of eccentric features about this hotel room. For instance, to use the lights, you needed to place the metal attached to your key in a slot by the door. To use the airconditioner, you needed to use a remote that controlled the air conditioner, which was located 9 feet up in the wall. When you left the hotel, you were requested to leave your key at the front desk. If you returned at night, the door to the hotel was locked and you had to buz the front desk. When we went to check out at 5:15 AM, the front desk clerk was sleeping and it took us until 5:30 AM to wake him. Street hotel is located was certainly less seedy that the area around the train terminal. Most of the businesses were not geared to tourists. There were only a few restaurants and two of those were McDonalds and Burger King! Hotel had no ice. The breakfast had no hot foods and the foods they did offer were not very tasty. For instance, they had ceral that looked like rice krispies, but certainly did not taste like them! In summary, location is good, hotel is very clean but I think this hotel might have too much character for the typical American tourist.", "Date": "September 4, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cI'll stay at the Miami hotel again on my next visit.\u201d", "Author": "Madrile\u00c3\u00b1a", "ReviewID": "UR2483366", "Content": "Excellent Hotel, even better staff, always helpful and cheerful.
