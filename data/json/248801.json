Note for non-Spanish speakers: some of the staff do not speak English, so be prepared to make an effort to learn at least the basics! The rooms are somewhat charming in their decor, but as it is such an old building with inferior ventilation, there was a definite mold problem in the room. There is no A/C and there are no fans, however the windows do open (but there are no screens and the windows open directly out to a common walkway). The bathroom shower leaked onto the floor and made a generally big mess. Soap was provided, but no shampoo or any other toiletries. The safe in our room was broken, but they allowed us to use one in an unoccupied room, and we were charged for use of said safe even though they did not disclose the charge in advance. the rooms have kitchenettes, however no dishes or utensils whatsoever. bonus: if you ask for the password, you can use the free wifi. the staff was friendly. when we arrived there were no pillowcases on the pillows (somewhat disturbing because the pillows were pretty gross looking). they changed the sheets, but not pillow cases each day.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cAdequate lodging\u201d", "Author": "Robert B", "ReviewID": "UR107663825", "Content": "We had an appointment with immigration, so I was looking for an affordable hotel in this area. Having lived in Mexico for several years, the idea of a real \"Mexican\" hotel and not a ''chain\" hotel did not discourage me. I found the hotel to be more or less what I expected. It's small and there did not seem to be much activity. I only encountered a couple of other guests while using the stairs and elevator. The night was fairly quiet and uneventful. The rooms are older, but are large 2 room suites. The bed was typical Mexican--hard as a rock. There was a nice flat screen TV with cable.Wireless internet worked flawlessly. Breakfast was included in the price of the room ($85USD) and consisted of coffee, toast, fruit, and juice, all served by a delightful gentleman who's worked at the hotel for 10 years. The restaurant is undergoing remodeling currently. Compared to the prices of other nearby hotels, I think this hotel was a good value. It's not a 5-star luxury property, but it was certainly adequate for my needs. I would choose this hotel again.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mill Valley, California", "Title": "\u201cPick Carefully in Polanco\u201d", "Author": "QuincyVelie", "ReviewID": "UR4076624", "Content": "The Hotel Residencia was not bad, but not really a 'boutique' hotel as their Web site stated. The room decor was fine, however sparse, and was suprisingly the size of a suite. Details were amiss however - no hangars in the closet, furniture was slightly mis-arranged, hall lights were burned out and I could not find a thermostat. There were also few electrical outlets. On a positive note the staff was very freindly and helpful, and all but one desk attendant also spoke English. The bed was very nice, with extra long and soft pillows, and the free satellite TV channel options were good. The shower included a full size tub and plently of hot water and water pressure. There was also a kitchenette, but if you are spending this much on a hotel, why not eat out? The fridge was also too tiny for wine or champagne, and was on the floor requiring one to crouch down to use it. Having no business center or computer to use for Internet access was a major fault, and in this price range, I wish I had spent +$50/night for the Nikko, a fantastic hotel. Don't let location be a draw here as it was for me - this was on the very edge of the Polanco district and walking a few blocks was required to get into a decent restaurant and shopping area. Making things worse, its street block was very dark at night. Newton Street is one way in most sections which wreaked havoc with my taxi dropoffs. Hotel Polanco, at the same price point, is a better value if one is in town for leisure and to enjoy this neighborhood conveniently and comfortably. And if you can spend more on the W, Intercontinental, Nikko or La Habita, its definitely worth it.", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residencia Polanco", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d248801-Reviews-Residencia_Polanco-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$96 - $157*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Newton 272 Colonia Chapultepec</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">11570</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "248801", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/6d/fd/6dfdc7752b885eee9b6c7bd61f57d5269large.jpg"}}
