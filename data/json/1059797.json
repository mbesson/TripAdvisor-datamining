By the time we arrived it was late and it was a bit harder to find this place as it is not a hotel on its own, but instead shares the building with other places and you have to ring the buzzer and then go to the reception on the S5 floor (the entry is a bit eerie in the dark). I believe the room we got was one of the larger rooms which had floor to ceiling entry doors and windows, so obviously the room was quite spacious and a good size. The overall impression though is that this is probably a bit more of a hostel than a hotel. The room has a small TV, towels, firm beds and in-built body wash dispensers. There was no tea or coffee making facilities and no phone to contact reception. Overall though the room was clean and provided the bare essentials. Our TV did not work at all when we arrived and the receptionist was very quick to resolve the problem. Free wifi is available throughout the building and you just need to get the login codes from reception. Location of this hotel is a bit further out of the city, but still ok. You can walk into the main city area in 20-30 minutes or train it in which is fairly easy. There are 2 small supermarkets about a 5 minute walk away (they close at 8pm), Subway and some other food places as well a bit further down the street (Chausseestra\u00dfe). We didn\u2019t pay for the hotel breakfast as I didn\u2019t think it would be worth the 7EU each and we just got stuff from the supermarket instead.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vevey, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cComfortable simple hotel near Berlin's centre\u201d", "Author": "MichaelScholl", "ReviewID": "UR119979895", "Content": "I stayed at the Mikon Eastgate Hotel for a long weekend to attend a scientific symposium at the Natural History Museum (Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde) of Berlin. The hotel was perfectly located being located less than a hundred meters from the Museum itself. The main reception which is open 24 hours a day is located on the fifth floor of the building, near the terrace and the breakfast room. Breakfast is well priced at 7.5 Euros and was buffet style catering for everyone's tastes. The single room was clean, very large, light and comfortable with two large windows open on an open space between the buildings, a desk, cupboard and a large en-suite bathroom. The hotel also offered free high-speed WIFI access in the room which is always greatly appreciated. The hotel is situated less than 20 minutes easy walk to the centre of Berlin and the main tourist attractions. I would most definitely return and stay at the hotel especially for business purposes, but maybe not for a romantic escapade.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Odessa, Ukraine", "Title": "\u201cTypical GDR Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Viktor K", "ReviewID": "UR119838482", "Content": "Located in the eastern part of Berlin with more soviet style atmosphere, this hotel is on the top floor of the building, so you always come in like to the appartments.

Besides the basics (bed/cupboard) and free wifi there is nothing else to shout about. Bathrooms were clean though. They allowed us to store our luggage in a makeshift room when we checked out and use of a toilet.
