But as I travel to Singapore a lot, often staying for a week or more, paying S$200-300 a night for a decent hotel would break the bank. Over the years I've tried just about everything there is in the S$100 a night price range in Singapore - and the Victoria Hotel is the only one to which I have returned. What I like about the Victoria Hotel is it's location. It's five minutes from Raffles City where there's lots of good shops and restaurants, and within walking distance of three MRT stations on three lines (Bras Basah - 4 mins, City Hall - 7 mins, Bugis - 10 mins). Although I am always there on business, tourists enjoy being close to Bugis Junction, and Orchard Road and Marina Bay Sands are just two stops away on the MRT (in different directions). Or you can walk to both if you are looking for some exercise. The Victoria Hotel is just down the road from the National Library where there is a Hanis Cafe which serves the best flat white in town (Illy coffee). It also serves cheap western meals, and there are hawker stalls in an adjacent building which sells even cheaper local food. The hotel has free wi-fi in all the rooms with good signal strength. It occasionally drops out, but a call to reception to ask them to reboot fixes the problem. The rooms are small but they are clean and have a separate shower cubicle in the bathroom (a rarity in hotels in this price range in Singapore). There is a fridge and TV in the room and the air- conditioners work well and not too noisy (split system type). There is a 7-11 store on the ground floor, a small restaurant and a money changer. So those are the pros. Now for the cons: Some of the rooms have a problem with small ants. From memory, they seem to be ones on lower floors. In many of the rooms there is a bad smell coming from the floor waste in the bathroom (if that bothers you, a quick trip to a pharmacy to buy a small bottle of Dettol will fix the problem temporarily). And the sound proofing of the doors is not that good, so if there are noisy early departures or revellers returning from late night drinking, sleep can be disturbed. But that's a problem in all cheap hotels in Singapore (in fact the Victoria Hotel is not as bad as most others as it has carpet on the floors of the corridors which helps to muffle the sound). The reception staff (with a couple of exceptions) are quite indifferent to your presence, but they do respond promptly to requests for assistance. The housekeeping staff have a much more friendly demeanour. On this particular trip I have been lucky - no ants in the room, no smell in the bathroom, and one of the reception staff actually smiled! I've been woken up earlier than I needed with housekeping staff starting work at 7.30am, but if you are an early riser thst wouldn't worry you. Some stays at the Victoria - like this one - have been good, but others not so good.

I'll add a few additional points for reinforcement: The \"queen/deluxe\" bedroom was really just two beds pressed together. Certain rooms will have a patio with chairs outside etc, but lets face it, you're in Singapore with weather that may not really put these patio to much use. Internet is provided by WiFi, while it was not slow, it certainly isn't super fast. No real complaints though as internet access is free.

There are several bus stops near the hotel and across the street. There are two nearby mrt stations - bugis and city hall. Bugis is much nearer by foot. On a cool day or night, you can even walk to tourists spots from the hotel - like clarke quay. The rooms are very clean. They also clean it everyday upon your request and they replenish your toiletry/ bathroom stocks everyday even if you still have unused ones. They don't have room service though...and you can hear people walking along the hallways. Don't expect a good view from your room windows since the hotel is in between to buildings... Overall, if you just need a good place to sleep during the night after your non-stop tour in Singapore, this is a good hotel to stay in for the price...We booked via Agoda.com so we also saved some money.=)", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cCould be much better!\u201d", "Author": "digtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR63275427", "Content": "This hotel is very well located and therefore could be a very good hotel.

There's also free internet, but it regularly disconnects. But at least it works sometimes! However, the good things stop there. The bad news: * If you're Asian, avoid the hotel as the staff aren't friendly towards Asians. They prefer people of European descent (ie Caucasian). When I checked in, there was a middle aged lady who was at the reception. I don't know if she was having PMS or menopause, but she never smiled or greeted my friend and I in a friendly manner. In short, she seemed pretty unhappy with our arrival despite it not being busy and we don't look like dirty people or crooks or something. During the check in transaction she was pretty rude as well. Throughout our visit, the middle aged lady was pretty cold towards us and never smiled at us even as we walked past the reception and we smiled at her. Despite her coldness towards us, she was extremely friendly with caucasian people - smiling and chatting away in a friendly manner. * If you're a light sleeper, stay elsewhere. The walls are paper thin and you can hear the 'music of the night', babies crying, lifts moving, people who stumble in from a late night talking in the halls, cell phone ringtones... you name it, you can probably hear it. * One day I wanted to sleep in after working until quite late, so I put the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign so Housekeeping wouldn't disturb my sleep. Guess what? Housekeeping knocked on my door and asked if I wanted my room cleaned. What's the point of giving guests the option of having the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign hanging on the door knob if you still are going to disturb people? In terms of the bathroom amenities, it's pretty basic. They have body soap and shampoo, toothbrushes, combs, and showercaps.

All the bookings done etc and we were set. The hotel is surrounded by two buildings that towers over this one, the SMU building and the Allson hotel. As we had arrived by train at the City Hall MRT, we were aghast as to where Victoria Hotel would be and alas, there it was, with its Sky Blue letterings against the white background - Victoria Hotel. Upon reaching the lobby, we were met by a lady who is probably in her mid 40s or early 50s behind the receptionists' counter. I wouldn't exactly say that the service was good but neither can I say it was bad. It just wasn't the best service I've had from her and all the formalities were done without a smile. However, it may come across as rather hypocritical but services meted by her to visitors who were caucasians were by far better than what we had. I do remember reading a review posted by someone else highlighting this case and was shocked that it was true. Without further ado, we went to our rooms to unpack etc. My next few mornings were hell. Around 8 in the morning, loud music could be heard from outside my room, music being played loudly from a mobile phone. I woke up groggily and was quite peeved by that. To do that after 9 would be fine by me but at 8 when most of us were still asleep was just terrible. The day after, I was woken up by sounds from the service lifts that thudded with each passing floor. ARGH! The third day with a \"please do not disturb\" sign outside our door, we had people knocking on our door if we would like to have room service. Anyhow, being a light sleeper, it wasn't so much of the noise from outside my room windows ( as our room were facing the main road ) that woke me up but rather, the rather thin walls, room servicings etc. I can't say if I'd ever return but I wouldn't recommend this hotel to those who are light sleepers. Also, sanitary kits aren't provided making it harder for the ladies to dispose their, \"you know what\" :-) The plus points for this hotel would be its proximity to many attractions ranging from Plaza Peninsula, Plaza Singapura, Orchard Road, Cathay, Clarke Quay etc and the list could go on...and all within walking distances of about 10-25 minutes.

The bathroom again was small but the fittings were all fairly new and clean and the shower actually had plenty of room in it, worked well with plenty of hot water. The beds however were very hard and rather uncomfortable to sleep on. Overall though the service was very good, with a very friendly maid who came to clean our room every day and we especially appreciated the 2 free bottles of mineral water that we got each day. A bonus was the little taverna on the ground floor of the hotel which served good value cooked breakfasts and also toast etc. If you go there try the Kaya on toast - it's delicious! Having a 7/11 next door to the hotel was also very convenient as was the money exchange counter which was also next door to the hotel.
