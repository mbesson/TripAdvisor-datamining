We stayed in Branson on an extremely busy weekend (Memorial Day Weekend) and finding a place without prior reservations was very difficult so by the time we checked in we were just thankful to be there. The staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed talking to them. The property itself was OK. The walkways were dirty but the swimming pool area was nice. There was an area to sit and read a book or just enjoy the outdoors. However, the rooms were not so great. I agree with one of the other posts that the lighting in the rooms was terrible. The beds were old and lumpy. The mattresses definitely need to be changed and the carpet was dirty. The bathrooms were average. I guess for the price of $54.00 night it was ok. I have stayed in worse places before. But if you are not particular about your room and are traveling on a budget, I would recommend this place.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wheaton, Illinois, United States", "Title": "\u201cBad experience\u201d", "Author": "Joyce O", "ReviewID": "UR129828922", "Content": "Stayed there May 2012.

We got a pretty good deal, but then again, you get what you pay for. I got the room mentioned above with the lack of water pressure and hole in the tub. I took a shower the first night we were there, and went straight to the manager after. He was nice but seemed kinda fidegtty, was slightly reluctant to help. I requested he either fix the problem, or move us to another room. He claimed there weren't any other rooms available. He had a little asian guy...and a translator...fix the tub faucet. When I pointed out the hole in the tub that looks like it was fixed by a child, he replied, \"but it's plastered.\"...the caulk was sharp and I was concerned that the child with us might hurt himself but the manager didn't seem to care. Also, the towels were ratty, torn and had holes in them. The number plate on our room was attached using scotch tape...if that doesn't scream \"ghetto\" I don't know what does. One positive thing, our second day there, we stopped by the hotel during the day and the manager was cleaning our room. I made a comment to him and he said his housekeeper was in an accident and couldn't work. I do like that he stepped up and cleaned the rooms instead of letting them go...although, he could have just been cleaning ours since I already complained...", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristow, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cTerrible, terrible, terrible read review for exact details.\u201d", "Author": "Scotty9674", "ReviewID": "UR100773182", "Content": "Cheap price, but there are better hotels for that amount.

It is free but only if you are close to the lobby. The rooms are in dire need of a update. The positives is that the pool and courtyard is nice and relaxing as well as being close to some of the good attractions. I guess for 150.00 with tax for 3 days you get what you pay for.

The breakfast was very tasty, as I love biscuits and gravy! I didn't swim in the pool, but I did relax on the bench and enjoyed listening to the crickets and watching the fire flies...

Bill at the front desk is very nice and helpful. Using a key and not a key card is not to safe though. The breakfast is terrible. The lady with long black hair is soooo lazy. She pretends she does not speak English when you ask for something. But then later she speaks English perfectly fine. She sits at the computer off the eating area playing solitaire when she should be tending to her job. My family went there for breakfast and the waffle mix was all gone there was no syrup, the biscuits were gone and the gravy was almost gone with just a little bit around the sides of the crock pot burning. When she finaly got off the chair playing solitaire because a man/customer got her attention she put a corn cob in the microwave for herself and then carried it around eating it while tending to the food; how nasty. My daughter asked for gravy and the lady scrapped all the left over out of the pot that was dried up and looked disgusting and handed it to my daughter. She is too ignorant to be embarrased.
