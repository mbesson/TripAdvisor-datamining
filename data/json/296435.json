The hotel is okay, friendly staff, my room was ensuite, small, could hear toilet flushing, shower from other rooms. Buffet breakfast is in the big very busy restaurant mainly on large tables, quite noisy, staff works hard but can't keep up with the large numer of guests, so tables are not always clean. Nevertheless the hotel was okay for the price I paid and I would stay there again", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Coruna, Spain", "Title": "\u201cIf you are looking just for a bed to sleep\u201d", "Author": "donperico", "ReviewID": "UR126633862", "Content": "A very basic hotel that I only could recommend you only if you go there only to sleep. I stayed here during four nights in a travel with my family. We booked two rooms facing the street. This is rated as a 4 star hotel and in my opinion is a 3star very basic. 1. The recepcion staff: Just correct, nothing special. 2. The rooms: Really basic. The carpet did not look very clean... Beds and bathrooms just OK. We were not disturbed for the noise of the street during the night. For us was silent not as said in another reviews. 3. The breakfast: The first morning we arrived at 9.45 (breakfast is until 10 am) because we were really tired for the previous night as we arrived to the airport late and to the hotel at 2.30 am. That morning the waiters were taking away the breakfast so we just could eat some coffee and boiled eggs. We did not like this as it did left 15 minutes yet. Next mornings we were at \"normal\" hours at the breakfast room so we could enjoy the whole food. Bread rolls were delicious. 4. Location: Not very centric but near to a tram stop to arrive in five minutes to the Blue Mosque and Santa Sofia Mosque. If you are in a budget, or you are looking just an acommodation to sleep, this could work to you. Really basic hotel so do not expect any luxury.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "othmane", "ReviewID": "UR125696692", "Content": "Just came back from Istanbul, I stayed at the Istanbul Royal hotel and for me it is the best location possible you can be, it is located in the Laleli area, 2 minutes far from the Tram station which u can use to go to Grand Bazaar ( beyazit stop ) Bosphorus, spice bazaar and Eminono ( eminonu stop ) Blue Mosque & aya sophia ( Sultanahmed Stop ), the tram is really good and cheap 2 TL per jeton.

The local restaurants are limited but we ate at a cheap and cheerful place around the corner one night. It is right on the edge of the major clothes shopping area. Location is really 3 1/2 stars as we did walk quite a bit each day owing to this. We easily reached the hotel by public transport from Ataturk Airport (hotel almost on top of Aksaray station), but the tram can get very crowded so not for everyone or if arriving during rush hour. The staff were very attentive, courteous and friendly and spoke good English (a blessing for us who were terrible at Turkish!). The room was very clean and the twinshare beds were very comfortable. The only problem with the room was the air-conditioning needing to remain on as room got quite warm(I slept with ear-plugs, which I often do anyway). However, you could leave the window open which may cool the room down adequately for most. Breakfast was functional but the tables not set up for pairs or couples and the music was not to everyone's (i.e. my) taste. Overall, a nice place to relax after a very hectic day in a very hectic city and would definitely stay again.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel Clean and And Big Rooms\u201d", "Author": "fcamlica", "ReviewID": "UR105009502", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for a bz porpose the rooms was big compare the other hotels we stayed in Istanbul..
