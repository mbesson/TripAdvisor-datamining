We rented one of the rooms and another couple who had a small child stayed in the 2nd room. My husband and I stayed here for three nights in August 2010 and paid 50 euro per night. LOCATION: Great location, a 10 minute walk from the train station, 5 minute walk to a metro stop, 20 minute walk to the Colosseum. The street it's located on is pretty quiet at night. There is also a cheap internet place down the street and a few cafes for a light breakfast. ROOM: The room was very spacious, there was a king size bed and a twin for just the two of us. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room was clean when we arrived but it wasn't cleaned daily as stated in the room description. We did get fresh towels daily, though. I didn't like having the bathroom separate from the bedroom, but it was only for our use, so it wasn't too bad. BREAKFAST: The breakfast was very meager, no cereal, yogurt, biscuits and cake as described. We did have bread and jam and powdered coffee and hot chocolate was available. MANAGER: The manager was pretty nice when we arrived, but she doesn't speak English. I tried to make it work with my limited Italian. The batteries on our air conditioning remote control stopped working and instead of finding new batteries, she told us we would just have to share the remote control with the people staying in the other room. The morning we were leaving, the manager came at 9 am and she couldn't get in to the apartment with her key for some reason. When I let her in, she was annoyed with me and I'm not sure but I think she said that I had locked the bottom lock of the door (which I hadn't done). It was very strange. She went to clean the room of the people in the other room who had checked out earlier and then my husband and I went to get some coffee down the street before leaving. When I told her this, I could tell she was annoyed, probably because she wanted us to check out so she could leave. But check-out was not until 10, so I didn't care. OVERALL: The Domus Diana is pretty nice and convenient, but the last morning left a bad taste in my mouth with the manager getting annoyed with me for no reason. I would consider coming back because of the cheap price, and great location.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cExcellent B&B in center of Rome\u201d", "Author": "AlokKumar", "ReviewID": "UR84237317", "Content": "Recommended by a friend and now after my stay I would recommend to every one.

We asked someone in the building to find a way to get in and check in and he had no idea that there was a hotel in the building. He called the proprietor and she told him that she was having plumbing problems and that she had booked us somewhere else. She said that she had emailed us about this, but we never received the email. The place where she had booked us was her father's pension, with no breakfast and no air conditioning (two qualities that lead us to book this hotel).", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cClean, basic and central\u201d", "Author": "Jinty_7", "ReviewID": "UR67046929", "Content": "Although this was clean and comfortable, the furnishings were a bit dated. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was across the hall - we did have sole use. The owner does not live on site, so you get your own breakfast - so you can suit yourself when you have it. Plenty to eat and if you want, you can use the kitchen to cook your other meals. A few blocks from the Termini and when you leave, you can leave your cases at her father's hotel - a block from the Termini. Diana is friendly and helpful.
