So I picked the place because it was within walking distance to a wedding I was going to and because the price was within my limited price range. Not knowing San Francisco I had no idea of the area. What I found was the staff of the hotel was marvelous (incredibly friendly, helpful and caring about our stay.) I also found clean room, not fancy but exactly what we needed as we hoped to not spend a lot of time in the room anyway. Area wise we chose not to walk about much at night but did travel by cab and the staff were happy to help get us one. Easy walking distance to local transportation that enabled us to go anywhere.

After finding many hotels already booked in the beginning of December, we came across this one. It had a reasonable price and it was nearby the NY show we were going to. So we booked it in advance. Scary neighborhood (SOMA district) Lot's of homeless panhandlers/sketchy characters loitering in dimly lit alleys... My fiance wouldn't let me leave the room without him! The room smelled like BO. We had to buy car air fresheners and hang them from the lamps! Both nights we stayed there we heard loud arguments outside and even a gun shot that woke us up in the middle of the night! I guess you get what you pay for!", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR392908681", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "GhostTripper"}, {"Content": "Great Value. Read this review for the latest update on my stay... Ok, so I've read some mixed reviews on this hotel. There hasn't been an update in about a year so I figured I would give a fair update. Here's what to expect... The hotel is a little run down on the outside, and as others have mentioned it is in a questionable area of town. I don't totally agree with this. The hotel is located on Harrison street between 5th and 6th streets. There does seem to be more homeless people in this section of town, but San Francisco has a lot of homeless people in general. The general neighborhood where the hotel is located is a little run down. The streets have a considerable amount of trash on the sidewalks and the area seems a little rough around the edges. With this said, I don't necessarily think the hotel is in a scetchy neighborhood. I've seen worse in San Francisco by far (parts of the Mission and even North Beach are far more scarier!) The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the Moscone Convention Center, which was the purpose of my visit. I must say, the surrounding hotels in Union Square are in a better section of town but you will pay twice or even three times the price. With this said, here are the pros. The hotel rooms are VERY clean on the inside. The decor is neutral but tasteful. I had a king sized bed and I must say that is was extremely comfortable (more so than my bed at home!) The room was a decent size with a moderate sized bathroom. The AC was the only thing I really have a complaint about. It didn't seem to circulate through the room that well. This probably isn't that big of a deal considering that it gets quite chilly in the city at night. It just so happened that I came during a record high heat wave of almost 100 degrees. The room came with cable TV, a mini fridge, microwave and an iron which all were nice touches. The rooms must be well insulated because I couldn't here must outside or from the people from the rooms inbetween me. Another key selling point was free parking and free WIFI internet. Parking in the area runs from $10-$25 a day, and WIFI can run about the same price at other hotels. The staff was extremely friendly and they were more than willing to call a cab or give recommendations for restaurants in the area. I give the staff a 10/10 for helpfullness and friendliness. So, who should stay here? If you have a conference at the Moscone, this is the place to come. You can't beat what you get for the price. If your a honeymooner or someone looking to stay in the city at a cheap price for tourism, I wouldn't recommend it. You could find a cheap hotel in a nicer section of North Beach near the Fisherman's Wharf that would be a better fit. I hope this review has helped.", "Date": "May 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR915386030", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "arcampo"}, {"Content": "No thanks Stayed here one night and that was enough.

The neighborhood is a tad on the questionable side--I wouldn't recommend walking around alone late at night--but it's within easy walking distance to the Union Square area. The nice thing about being in a place that's a bit off the beaten path is that drug addicts and pushy panhandlers who San Francisco is known for (I've lived in New York, Washington, Boston, and several African cities, and never encountered anything as bad in this regard as San Francisco) aren't around so much, because there aren't so many well-off tourists and shoppers around.The room was immaculately clean, and the service was incredibly friendly. Free wireless Internet was a big plus, too. (Many of the expensive hotels charge you for it.) Of course, you get what you pay for, and the Inn is by no means luxurious. My main complaint would probably be that the walls are a little thin. And since it's a motel, you have people walking by your room quite often.That said, I'd recommend the Inn to travelers who are just looking for a basic, clean place to sleep. Definitely not for honeymooners or if you're looking for a place with room service.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR449016162", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "GelEGuy"}, {"Content": "Great Value We arrived late at night and found this place.

My 6 year anniversary with my girlfriend was almost ruined by the mismanagement and employee inabilities at THE BAY BRIDE INN! We made reservations at hotels(-) at least five days prior to arrival in San Francisco. But when we showed up to the hotel an hour early we had no idea what we were going to be getting ourselves into. The employee at the desk told us that our room would not be availible until an hour from now, so he promptly gave us a map to the city and circled sights that we should see. We weren't in to much of a rush to check in so we agreed to come back later.  We had lunch at the Fisherman's Wharf and came back two hours later. The man at the desk than told us that are room isn't technically ready. He than explained that the room we had reserved was not availible and that the guest who was supposed to check out chose to stay an extra night. The hotel gave him our room even though we had reserved it. The hotel than said that they had a smokin room availible (we asked for a non-smoking room) and that we should look at it. We walked in to find the room still in disaray, the bed looked like it had just been slept in, everything was disorganized, and there was a pungent smell coming from a dehumidifier plugged in at the corner of the room. We were enraged! Going back down to the check-in desk the employee than told us that was the only room they had and that it should be ok if we just left the dehumidifier on. THERE WAS NO WAY WE WERE STAYING THERE!!! He than said there was nothing that he could do and that's the only room they had and that his nose is sensitive and he didn't have an issue with the smell. After consoling my girlfriend we went to our car, we didn't know what to do, we had to make it to a show in about two hours and we don't have an acceptable room to stay in. After calling several hotels we found one THE ADANTE in Union Square. The whole time we were calling other hotels the family owner's of the Bay Bridge were stairing at us while we were in the car. The employee was also walking back and forth around the hotel arguing with someone. During a call we made the employee knocked on our car window to tell us he had an idea. He had a friend who lived at the hotel who could move out of his room and give us his for the night until another room becomes availible. He would move his friend's stuff out himself to the 'Smoking Room' and just tell his friend when he comes in that we were staying in his; there was no way! We made our reservations at The Adante and all we had to do was get a refund from this nightmare. Per our hotels(-) reservation for a cancelation we would be charged a $25 fee to cancel our reservations before 6PM. It was 4PM, when we went back in to talk with the employee again he said he would not give us our refund. He would have to charge us for a full night's stay and than give us back our money for the next two nights. We told him that he could not charge us according to the agreement with hotels(-) that per the paperwork there would only be a $25 charge. He argued with us saying that we were wrong and that he was trying to help us. We told him that we were calling hotels(-) about the situation. He than prompted to try to call them first so we would not be able to get all our money back!!! After what seemed liked hours everything was settled and hotels(-) fixed everything for us by not only giving us a full refund but not charging us a cancelation fee. For all you travelers I highly suggest you pay that extra fee to stay somewhere a little bit more expensive. You don't want an experience like the one we had. You won't want your room given to someone else, or realize that the only place you have to stay is somewhere with dirty bed sheets, and an odor of disenffetant that's trying to cover something the owners don't want you to smell. THE ADANTE was affordable, we checked in between an hour of when we called, it was close to everything we needed to go to, the rooms were a little small but they were great, the bathrooms were large, people were nice, and not to mention we got a card that gave us two free draft beers at the 24fps bar each night we stayed. Trust me, you shouldn't go through something like this during a time that's supposed to be a vacation a celebration.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR784165059", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Little place of comfort The location isn't as great but the rooms are great.

When I made the reservation three months prior, the price quoted was consistent with the Travel Discount book we had ($49 to $55), which was confirmed on the phone with the owner. However, when we arrived, the owner said he wouldn't honor that price because only five people were allowed to use the coupon. We brought the book in and pointed out it was not indicated anywhere about such restrictions, and that he didn't inform us about it when we made our reservation. I was frustrated and walked out of the office, after which he promptly decided to offer us a slighly higher price than the Discount book ($59 compared to $55). When we checked out two days later, he denied having this conversation yet again, and told us you just found the Discount book somewhere, you did not have it before. He even beat his chest and told us to swear in God's name... anyway, he raised the price to $70/night, and denied anything he had told us before. We paid it in order to keep peace, but told him we would never stay at any of his places again (he also owns the Roadway inn.)Place was Ok, but they use too much Pinesol, which might be covering an insect poison substance. All of our clothes smelled of this mix.
