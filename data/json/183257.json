The clerk then stated that he could not give us a cot, another room or any accomodations for this extra fee that we had just paid as nothing was available. He then directed the three of us to an extremely small, basement, room with one bed that was filled with a stench of cigarette smoke. It was awful as our eyes burned, it was difficult to breath and one of us became immediately ill just after a few minutes of being in the room. The window wouldn't open and there was no fan in the bathroom to air it out. We spoke to the clerk to address our concerns where he simply stated, there's \"no refund, no refund.\" The poor conditions forced us to to forfeit the hotel and parking cost and we checked out within ten minutes of being there.

Also, some people have speculated that the poor service is due to the fact that the staff speaks French, but I speak enough French to get by and this did not improve the service. I highly recommend that travelers stay away from this hotel.

Make sure that you book your parking space in advance (4 spaces for 13 rooms)as we were left the first night without hotel parking...we did park in a garage down the street, but did not have enter & exit privileges. We paid $262 CDN for three nights (tax included) plus $15 per night for parking, local calls were $0.59 each. The hotel itself is three stories with 3-4 rooms per floor and 1 or 2 in the basement. I would not want to stay on the main floor, as it opens directly into the lobby (when I was in the lobby for ice, I could hear a woman giggling from her room). We stayed in #304 (3rd floor)and found it to be in excellent condition. New furniture,tv, carpet, bedding, tub, shower, etc. We had an iron and board in our room, ice box, hair dryer, and clock radio. When I walked by other rooms the maid was cleaning, they all appeared to be the same. The windows were old, but could be opened to let in fresh air. We had a thermostat in our room but always found it to be a little warm, so we left the window open at night (the blinds kept out the light). One night we had a trumpet player on the corner playing everything from Hockey Night in Canada to Oh When The Saints Come Marching In.... Continental breakfast was provided in the morning. The only negative I could find with this hotel was the size of the room. It was small...about 10X10, but what do you really need the space for? St. Catharine Street is about 30 paces from the front door and you could walk down to Crescent Street in about 15-20 minutes. We took a cab that cost $8 with the tip. There is a taxi stand on the corner of Rue de Fort and St. Catharine, so you never have to wait for a cab. Around the corner to the left is the Italian Rotisserie, a diner type restaurant with AMAZING Italian food (our bill was under $20). To the right is a 24 hour diner that fit the bill for after the bar food!! Service was slow, but the place was packed and there was only one waitress...food was good. If you eat meat, you cannot go to Montreal and not go to Schwartz's Deli (St. Laurent Blvd. - not walking distance). \"The best place in the Milky Way to sample smoked meat sandwiches!\" - Time Magazine There was a 15 minute wait on the street to get in, but it was WELL worth it. Again, our bill was under $20!

Pretty plain room with a bed, small TV with lots of channels, table, chair, closet and dresser. There was no bathtub, only a shower, and it was tiny. The bathroom was very small. We had a big fan in the room for air conditioning. The room was clean. There was no soundproofing as we could hear people talking and entering and exiting their rooms. There were some donuts and muffins at the front desk for breakfast which was a nice touch. Staff was friendly and helped us in booking a tour to Quebec City(which I highly recommend) Montreal has a lot to see and do. We were only in the room at night. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a clean room to sleep in overnight. Do not expect too much and you will not be disapointed. Deffinetly not a luxury hotel.

It was next to impossible to find an affordable room in town, so I was stuck with what I got. Firstly, my room was in a basement, and there were no bars on the windows. This put me off, as a woman travelling alone, but also there was no possiblity of a breath of fresh air. There is no dedicated safety deposit for valuables, and no extra ID was taken when the front desk took them from me, of gave them back to me. However, in the basement, I felt this was somewhat safer than leaving my passport in the room.The vacuuming was truly limited to the center of the room ( a button on the baseboards next to the bed was there for the whole visit of 3 nights) and my hair was never picked up off the bathroom floor. Although the toilet had been changed, the old grouting had been left on the tiles, and was brown and grubby where the new fixture was smaller than the old. However, the bed linens appeared to be very clean, and the sink and shower were also attended to. For this I had the privilege of paying $400 on the Friday, as it was Grand Prix.

It was really a good experience, especially for the price. The rooms are neat and clean, with a vaguely nautical decor that was really interesting. The showers are hot, the towels are skimpy, but they're willing to give you more. It was a wonderful place to spend a hibernation weekend - the rooms were small and very cozy. If you have back problems, I wouldn't recommend it - the beds are hard! There's an open market right around the corner to get all kinds of nice things to eat, and its right in the center of the action - right next to Rue St Catherine! There's also a Thai restaurant (a good one, but I don't remember the name) right around the corner, and a Metro stop not too far away. One caveat, though, make a reservation or get there early. We got in around 7 pm and got the last room in the place, only because it was reserved. Overall, this was a great place for people who just want a room in admidst the touring, but if you're used to travelling in style, this hotel will probably be a little lowbrow for you. It did have an incredibly 30s speakyeasy quality though, due to the locked front door and completely outre marble and iron decor of the stairs and small lobby.
