Me and a friend took a chance on lastminute.com with a secret 4* hotel and it was completely worth it. The hotel is out of the city centre as mentioned but the bus stop is literally outside and you simply catch the 881 bus into town, takes about 20 mins (tip: you can buy a bus pass for 1 euro but no one ever checks so you can get away with not paying). We read plenty of reviews before but just to note that if you're flying into Fiumicino airport you just catch a train from the station to Ponte Galeria and from there the bus 808 which stops right outside the hotel, travel round the city is very easy on buses. Taking taxis isn't worth the price at all. The hotel was large and the reception area spacious and very modern. The rooms are almost all completely renovated, we had a room on the 6th floor (top) and the lift is incredibly slow, you can walk up/down the stairs at a slow pace and still beat the lift. Our room was pleasant and roomy enough, it was serviced daily with fresh towels and bedding. The TV is lacking in any English channels but to be honest, who wants to watch TV when in Rome? Films are available at a price of 10 euros and there isn't a wide choice but this didn't bother us. Toiletries were available on request if you had forgotten anything and complimentary shower gel/shampoo/soap and shower caps were in the bathroom and replenished daily. Breakfast was buffet style with cakes, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, ham, cheese, bread, eggs, bacon. It generally doesn't get re-stocked once gone so best to get down there early if you want a wide choice. We did also have a club sandwich one evening when we had already had a full dinner at lunch and this was very enjoyable. You don't see many other guests other than at breakfast as I assume most of them went out during the day like us. Reception were helpful when we asked where they'd recommend to eat (Macheroni restaurant in town, for pasta it was brilliant!) and they also kept our luggage in storage on checkout day which saved us lugging around our bags until we were going to the airport. All in all, great place to stay in Rome if you don't mind travelling on the bus. Would recommend to anyone, fantastic value for money. Tips for Rome: Tours for areas such as Colosseum/Vatican museums are great and means you can skip the sometimes incredibly long lines. However they will know you're a tourist and try to get you to pay more than needed. At the Colosseum don't pay more than 15-20 euros and Vatican 35-40 (if you're under 25/have a student card you get discounts). Open top buses are good for getting around the city, hop on/hop off. 25 euros for 48hrs was well worth it.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel - Modern, Comfortable and Clean!

It said that \"this offer is so good that the hotel chain don't want to advertise that they are giving such a low price\". We knew this was a risk but the price (\u00a3184 for 4 nights) and the location 'easy access to the vatican city' proved too much temptation and we plumped for the 'secret hotel' obviously ending up with the Hotel Pisana Palace \u2026 and\u2026all in all I think we really landed on our feet! I was initially very disappointed to find out how far out of town it is (12km) but despite being inconvenient it\u2019s not the end of the world as town is accessible. The 881 bus runs from 5.30am to 12midnight everyday and stops outside the hotel and drops off at the edge of the Centro Storico. It takes 20- 30 minutes depending on traffic, which isn't too bad, but longer if you take into account the hanging around at the bus stop waiting - there isn\u2019t a timetable so you just have to hope you are lucky. My estimate is that they come every 15 - 20 mins during the day and less frequently at night. I would really recommend getting hold of a bus map \u2013 available at http://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?p=18&i=14 As for the hotel itself it has been recently renovated and is very modern, and clean to the point of clinical. The interior feels minimalist and a little space age \u2013 but it is functional more than anything and although it\u2019s not luxurious, everything is comfortable \u2013 with big beds, strong showers and well adjusted air conditioning. The staff are friendly without being fawning and speak serviceable English. The buffet breakfast had plenty of options (cereal, bread, cake, tinned fruit, yoghurt, eggs, bacon, ham, cheese) however my only complaint is that things were never refilled. If they ran out of butter that was it, it was gone. And the muesli was finished on the first day and never replaced. Small gripe. Getting to Pisana Palace from Ciampino Airport I think if you fly into Fiumicino airport it is a fairly direct route to the hotel. However we flew into Ciampino and it was a bit more complex. You could of course get a taxi, but if you have the time and not the budget for that the best way to do it seems to be: Get a Terravision bus from outside departures to Termini in central Rome (4Euros), then walk round the corner to the bus stop and get on a 64 bus (direction St Peters), this takes you through the old town, across the river then under a tunnel, you want to get off the first stop after the tunnel and at the same bus stop you get off at you can get on a 881 which will take you direct to the hotel.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, good value, location not a problem\u201d", "Author": "gad_oxf", "ReviewID": "UR67901802", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for four nights a few weeks ago. After being messed around by the BA strikes, we ended up flying into the airport late at night, which put paid to our getting the train and bus to the hotel - no worries though as we were able to negotiate a transfer at the airport for 40 euros. The check-in desk was manned by very helpful staff (who had a good command of English) who checked us in efficiently and directed us to our room, which was immaculately decorated (must have been one of the rooms that has been refurbished recently). As far as we could tell, they are not letting rooms out in the main body of the hotel - all the occupied rooms seemed to be in the same wing - I assume this is because refurbishment is ongoing but we heard no noise and saw no sign of this. The one bugbear we had was that there was no shower curtain in the bathroom, so water went all over the floor. Aside from that, it was very tastefully decorated, very clean, and a huge room by anyone's standards. There is a large flat-screen television in the room, a huge bed (and we had a camp-bed set up also, which made for a useful place to put our bags), air conditioning. The view is of the carpark but that can't be helped. Location-wise, yes, it is out of central Rome, but the bus stop is literally directly across the road from the hotel. The buses are frequent and reliable, and relatively quick. Bus fares are one euro for a ticket with validity for 75 minutes, which is more than enough to get you in to central Rome (about 20 mins), or even changing onto another bus (64 or 40) to get to the station. The first day we walked about a quarter mile down the road to the local tobacconist to buy bus tickets, but then realised that they do in fact sell them on the bus - there is a machine at the back vending them; once bought you then need to place them in the validation machine. Another advantage is that the bus route starts just one stop down the road which means it's easy to get a seat on the bus! Once in central Rome it's easy to walk everywhere, so public transport costs are limited to a couple of euros a day. The breakfast buffet was substantial which not only featured the typical Italian breakfast of cake, yogurt, coffee etc but also German- (cold meats, cheese, bread, nutella) and English-style (bacon, eggs) breakfast. No complaints there, and the staff were very friendly. We did have a drink in the bar on our first night; this was relatively pricey but pleasant. We got the impression that as the renovation is going on, the number of people actually staying in the hotel is quite low, so you may have a hard time if you wish to meet fellow travellers in the bar. The hotel operate safety deposit boxes behind the main check-in desk. These are free to use and you are given the key to the safe to take with you, so we felt perfectly happy using this service. Our one disappointment was that there was no swimming pool (which would have been nice given the climate!). However this wasn't expected and would just have been a bonus so it doesn't affect my rating at all. All in all, a very pleasant stay for an exceptional price.

The buffet breakfast was very satisfying and the bar food was pretty good too, loved the pizza for 6.50 euros. The hotel is about a 15 to 20 minute ride from the major attractions. It was also very easy to reach from the airport. The buses run frequently and honestly, we never once paid to ride the bus or the train from the airport since no one checks. It is cheap to ride the bus though, only 1 euro, we just didn't have change all the time. The train from the airport is now 8 euro each way, and is a short ride and no one checked, so save your money and act like you didn't know if caught.

The newly renovated rooms were done up nicely, breakfast was plenty and services offered throughout the hotel were great. All staff were friendly and were able to honour our request for a twin room by email despite booking a double room. Very good hotel soon to be Holiday Inn Rome Pisana! Few things that may help if you're staying at this hotel: 1) Fiumicino Airport to Hotel The hotel provides shuttle service at cost of \u20ac35 for first two/three people plus 10 for additional passengers. But the frequency is not great, few in the morning and few in the evening. You can email the hotel for latest shuttle bus times, and to reserve your space. Cheaper (and more frequent) option is to take a train from the airport (Line FR1 destination Orte/Fara Sabina) to Ponte Galeria which is 3 stops away, approx 15 mins. This costs \u20ac5.50 and runs every 15mins, every 30min on Sundays. Buy the ticket from ticket desk in the airport railway station and make sure to validate it in one of the yellow machines as you enter the platforms. Get off at Ponte Galeria, walk to the main road (few metres away) and cross the road to the bus stop so that you're in direction towards a bridge. Get on bus 808 which takes you straight to the hotel in approx 20mins. One important note though - BUY THE BUS TICKET AT THE AIRPORT! You can buy it for \u20ac1 in a shop next to the ticket desks in Fiumicino airport railway station. Don't make the same mistake as us and rely on buying the ticket at Ponte Galeria (like we were told to do so by railway staff at Fiumicino). We arrived on sunday evening and there was no way of buying a ticket in the area and you can't buy on bus. In the end, we had to take a train back to Fiumicino and took a taxi to the hotel at a cost of \u20ac55. Note that if you're travelling back to the airport this way using bus and train, you will need to use a self service machine at Ponte Galeria to buy your train ticket as it is an unmanned station. This is in Italian although was just about easy enough to guess after a few attempts! 2) Food at Hotel The hotel bar serves food so that if you arrive late, you can eat there at a reasonable cost in comparison to the hotel restaurant which seemed expensive. Bar serves beer (pint/bottles) and all sorts of other drinks. Food wise, big enough pizza for one costed \u20ac6. They also have toasted sandwiches, amongst few other options. Pint of beer costs \u20ac5 - usually served with crisps and peanuts. Very good bar to chill out in after a day of tourism or travelling! 3) Safety Deposit Box Hotel website advertises that rooms come with a safety deposit box. This is NOT the case. But there are safety deposit boxes managed by the reception free of charge. 4) Bus to/from Rome Bus 881 runs from right outside the hotel (cross the road) to Vatican. From there, you can get on bus 571 which goes to Colosseo (you can't miss it)! If you need to get to a metro station, I'd recommend 881 to Vatican and then connect onto bus 982 (same stop as where 881 drops you off) to Ottaviano metro station. Hotel advises to get 881 to Cornelia metro station but reality is - 881 doesn't stop there and you can't see the station from the bus. likewise, we couldn't find the 881 bus stop from Cornelia when coming back from city centre. If you find yourself stranded in Cornelia, taxi back to hotel will cost just under \u20ac10. Hotel shop sells one day bus pass (\u20ac4) but didn't have 3 day option (\u20ac11) or 7 day option (\u20ac16) so buy them somewhere in Rome city centre. Not sure if hotel sold single tickets though. Hotel is about 20-30min (or more depending on traffic) away from centre but we already knew that from the reviews here. The hotel is very good value for money for those who don't mind a bit of travelling like us! Oh and be careful with bus times. 881 and 982 runs until about 11.30pm but others may stop running earlier. 571 from Colosseo stops at approx 7pm. Check the bus stop sign! 5) Shops Supermarket is 10 mins walk up the road, just follow the main road heading towards Rome city centre. Only open in the daytime though! There is also a pharmacy attached to the hotel although we didn't need to use it.

I had a wonderful stay at Hotel Pisana and I will explain why. We were on a roadtrip around Italy so at the time of booking a hotel in Rome (possibly the busiest city in Italy as far as traffic is concerned) our main requirement was that it was easily accessible by car, that it had a car park and easy access to the centre via public transportation. We had looked at hundreds of websites but it\u2019s not easy to find anything like this when travelling on a budget! The Hotel Pisana, on the other hand, fitted the bill as it\u2019s very easy to reach from the Great Ringroad (and we didn\u2019t even have a SATNAV!), it\u2019s got a big free car park right in front of it (which is patrolled at night, so no worries whatsoever) and it\u2019s got a bus stop on the opposite side of the road, and the bus goes straight into St. Peter\u2019s or the city centre. The bus ticket is ONLY 1 \u20ac and it can be purchased directly on board...what else could you ask for?? It\u2019s located in a residential neighbourhood which looked very OK to me, I felt quite safe really. The second requirement was obviously price. Rome as any other capital in Europe can be very expensive and often you don\u2019t honestly get what you pay for. We managed to book on the hotel\u2019s website and get a 5% off on the rate because we booked more than 2 nights, paying around 47 \u20ac per night for a double room. Obviously we weren\u2019t expecting luxury for this price. It\u2019s true that the hotel has some floors which have been renovated and some which haven\u2019t (I guess the top floors), whereas the whole reception, bar, and restaurant area have been entirely renovated in a kind of modern funky style. Our room was on the 5th floor, and it wasn\u2019t one of the renovated ones. The furniture was quite old, as was the bathroom, but \u2013 surprise surprise \u2013 they were both spotlessly clean. The room was cleaned thoroughly every day and we got clean towels and clean bedsheets everyday, and honestly I felt very relieved when I saw that. I couldn\u2019t care less about the old carpet or curtains when I realized the place was really clean all over every day (we stayed for 3 nights). But what struck me the most and made me give 2 thumbs up to this hotel was breakfast. It was absolutely brilliant. You had an endless range of choice of fresh food and beverages every day: eggs, bacon, different types of bread and \u201cpizza romana\u201d (a special bread with sea salt and rosemary), several types of home made fresh cakes (at least 3 or 4 types every morning, all of them delicious), several types of fresh seasonal fruit (especially melon and watermelon, as it was summer), freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juices, croissants, butter and jam, yoghurts, honey, cereals.... really, everything you could ever wish from a breakfast! And you could order espresso or cappuccino from the bar, with absolutely no extra charge (which I did everyday! their cappuccino was delicious). I honestly thought they would charge us extra euros for this amazing breakfast, but they didn\u2019t!! It really was included in the price of the bedroom! We were so full up after breakfast that we didn\u2019t get hungry until dinner time, which honestly saved us lots of money as Rome can be very expensive! And the staff in the bar area was most nice and helpful, I really loved having breakfast there everyday, it almost felt like being home. Also the staff at the front desk were really helpful. We asked if they would recommend us a restaurant nearby for dinner and they booked for us a table at the only restaurant they work with, which is a 5 minute drive from the hotel. Well, that was one of our best dining experiences on our holiday. I am Italian and I hate touristy places but that was an authentic local dining experience with lots of excellent food!! And very reasonably priced as well. If you really want to enjoy the real Italian food, definitely off the beaten track, make sure you pop in, it\u2019s called Schiavi d\u2019Abruzzo.

The size of the bedroom and the bathroom was medium and there was cleaning service every day (we had clean towels every day). The breakfast was just amazing. There are so many choices to eat and drink; it was a good start for the long walks at the city centre. There is a bus stop outside the hotel where you can take 881and go at the city centre. You can also stop at Piazza Carpegna and take 791 and go to the metro station Cornelia and from there go wherever you want. Also, 881 stops outside San Pietro. You need 30 minutes to reach the centre but we already knew that the hotel was outside the centre so there is no reason to complain.

The charge for each person is 10\u20ac . The staff was very patient and nice to us since we were asking them so many questions every day-they were very helpful. The only negative that I have to say is the use of internet connection. There was big charge per hour and I think that a four-star hotel should provide internet for free to its clients. Apart from that we have many good and pleasant memories from the hotel.

The continental breakfast was more like a full meal, consisting of eggs, meat, milk, yogurt, bread, cereal etc. and kept us going until dinner. Almost all of the staff spoke English, and were helpful when we asked how to take the bus and trains, and how to get around to all the city's attractions. When we were leaving, the lady at the front desk even printed a detailed train schedule for us to follow and explained how to take the trains. (Being from North America, we were new the the whole regional train system) The only negative was that the hotel is a 20 minute bus ride to downtown Rome. It wasn't so much a hassle to take the bus, as the stop is directly across the street from the hotel, but that the metro bus stops at 11:30pm, so if you miss the only bus back, you can expect an expensive cab ride.

Rome has so many hotels that are better yet still affordable, it is surprising this one is still in business. Most reviewers say \"Good for the money\", or \"Not so bad\". Don't get suckered in!!!! (Like we did.) With 1346 other hotels to choose from in Rome, why get stuck with \"not too bad.\" One side is upgraded with nice beds, on-demand t.v., newer baths. The other is filthy, with beds made out of stone and bus station style bathrooms with moldy grout. The front desk staff is full of smiles, but absolutely devoid of actual service. We were travelling as a couple with our 17 year old son and daughter, both from our previous marriages. We confirmed with the hotel well in advance that we would need a room with twin beds for them. We arrived before check in time, stored our luggage, and were told by the front desk that everything was in order for the two rooms requested. When we returned that night they had \"given away\" our rooms. It took over 30 minutes to work things out. The air conditioning malfunctioned 3 times in 3 days. Twice it was fixed, one night we slept in a 90* room with a window that would not open. Every night until 11:00 there was a bunch of young men and women outside in the parking lot with loud music, playing soccer and hanging out. The hotel is located next to... nothing. It is 4+ miles to the closest attractions in Rome, and the only way to get there from the hotel is via bus. From what we were told it takes about an hour to get to the city via public transportation. There was a bus strike going on while we were there, so we didn't get a chance to verify this. The hotel itself is located right next to an abandoned parking stucture. From the hotel toward the city on Via Pisano there is a collection of small shops for the locals to use. After 3 nights we left Rome to visit other cities, then we were coming back for two nights before leaving. We certainly would have stayed in a different place, but we had already prepaid for 2 rooms for 2 nights. Before we left, we reminded the front desk when we would be back and the rooms that we would need. We returned 2 days later to the hotel at about 8:00 p.m. Sure enough, they had given away our rooms again, but would \"accomodate\" us on the other side of the hotel. As you step out of the elevator you are met by the filty carpet. It is only slightly better in the room. The beds as hard as plywood with a sheet on. We went down and immediately asked to be put back over to the side which we had reserved (the only one advertised on American web sites), but were told there were no more rooms. At the same time I was told this, another clerk checked a family of 3 adults into 2 rooms on the newer side. I checked at the front desk in the morning about the costs of the different sides. The area we had been placed in was 40 euros a night, far less than the price for the newer side. Nothing was offered to us in the way of a refund for the previous night, even though we had been given rooms that cost far less than what we had paid. Good things? The breakfast is plentiful, with an assortment of very good pastries. The people at the bar, who also run the breakfast, were very helpful and did whatever they could to get what we needed. Too bad the hotel isn't run by them! Reading these complaints can't give you any idea of how frustrating our stay was. The only time we spent in the hotel was in the morning before we headed out for the day, and in the evening when we were too tired to sightsee any more! That gives, at the most, 50 hours in the 5 days we spent. Imagine in 50 hours having to spend at least 7 of them grappling with the front desk about problems THEY have created! You might expect one problem at a hotel, but not problem after problem. Especially with no effort on their part to correct the problems and make sure they didn't happen when we came back for the 2nd half of the trip, but instead made it worse!

Good things about this hotel are that rooms are spacious, relatively clean, hotel has garage parking which is free (that way you can save 30-40 EUR per day if you are coming to Rome by car), the personnel is very friendly and helpful and breakfast is really excellent.

The 881 bus right in front of the hotel goes directly to the Vatican City, and took less than 30 minutes. There were restaurants about a 10-minutes walk away that were really cheap and good. We got a pizza big enough for 4 people for only 10-euro. Given that they charge you 4.50 for a latte in the Vatican, this was quite a relief on our budget! There was also a huge supermarket within walking distance where you can stock up on your Nutella. :-) I would probably stay here again, if I paid what I paid last time.

I kept thinking everyday I returned and it was dirty, 'I'm sure she'll notice it tomorrow' (starting from the first day I noticed it). It was SO obvious. After 4 days it had become so much worse (naturally), and it was so disgusting that I had to complain to the manager. Of course the manager argued with me at first saying the lady said she cleaned it, and that it's an \"old hotel\". It was so annoying to have one's intelligence so insulted. Anyone knows what \"number 2\" looks likes in a toilet!!! Even kids!! I wish I had done it sooner. So if you notice something wrong report it early.

Location-wise, it just can't be worse: not only it's way too far from attractions, as others have pointed out, you can't even find a convenience store around the hotel. I had a car but it's a headache to have to get on a car and drive 10-20 min before you can find a restaurant, for example. The neighborhood had a ghetto appearance to it, too! 3. The staff were extremely nice, friendly and helpful; alas, they're working in the wrong place! As related to this, I should point out that they stole my wallet in the Rome subway while I was on the train with my family (the only time I didn't use my car as Fontana di Trevi, I was told, can't be reached by car. It's nonsense by the way: you park your car a block away and easily walk down to the Fontana di Trevi). It took me 2-3 hours to get back to the hotel and I was sure all my credit cards would have been used to the last penny in that period of time. Fortunately, the staff helped me out tremendously by giving me quick and easy access to internet/phone so that I was able to block all the cards in time. BTW, none of the cards had been misused (I was pretty darn lucky!). While on this, may I advise you two things: 1)all they say about using \"neck straps\", \"body wallets\" etc. are ABSOLUTELY correct. Do use them as the bloody pickpockets are darn good in what they do. 2) before you take off for Europe, make sure you have all the INTERNATIONAL phone numbers of your banks, credit cards,etc written down somewhere. Most of these North American credit cards only give you 1-800 numbers, which are useless in Europe, of course. We had my wife's credit cards (she had wisely left her purse back in our room!) most of which were the same companies as mine. I mean, I had all the phone numbers available to me (as printed on the back of her credit cards) but still, they were utterly useless.
