{"Reviews": [{"Content": "We like it...we dislike it This hotel has some real problems with its management. It's quite unprofessional. The workers seem bored and many seem tired of serving the foreign guests who stay there.The front office seems to be uninformed often regarding room rates and how much a guest needs to pay or has already paid. The management doesn't seem to communicate well with it's workers or provide very good training.There are a few pluses. The gardens are large and peaceful. Children enjoy the large swings (but they are quite dangerous).The food during our recent stay was quite good but the dishes, table clothes, floors, and kitchen are often a dirty. We ate in an open dining area (an annex, not the main dining area) where there was often a terrible sewage odor coming from the kitchen area. One morning a portable light pole in the Kintamani restaurant almost came crashing down on some of the guests.Flies are almost always a problem in their kitchen and dining areas, though during our last week, there were a few less flies.The pool is getting worn and sharp edges on the ceramic tile present a hazard to children. Watch our for quite a few exposed electrical wires dangling from signs and other fixtures. Water hoses were laid haphazardly around the grounds and across sidewalks. Many outdoor water taps leak or flowed openly during much of the day.The beach outside the property is uncared for. Piles of dog feces made a challenging walk from the hotel property to the beach. Near the beach it looks like no one has swept the sidewalk or raked the sand in months. Very untidy. Quite a mess. Really unfortunate. Management could easily instruct its workers to make the beach side part of the hotel much more attractive.Our mattress was extremely uncomfortable. Dipped in the middle like a bath tub. Springs stuck me in the side while I slept.Solar hot-water heaters on the roof, leaked during our entire stay at the hotel. The leaking water poured onto sidewalks and even air conditioning equipment in several locations. Soon the sidewalks in those locations will be covered with slippery moss. Be careful!Hot water in our room was fine. Water pressure good and lighting was ok.If your room is near the restaurant, be prepared for late night singing and bands. In the early morning, restaurant workers were talking loudly and banging dishes quite a bit. Difficult to sleep late at night and early in the morning.Another unusual feature were the nightly fire crackers / fire works on the nearby beach between 9 pm and 11:30 pm each evening. It had nothing to do with the hotel, but some rowdy neighbors were having a good time. Again, hard to sleep with the explosions of fire works.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR358161246", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "IndonesiaLongTerm"}, {"Content": "good location with gardens / pool to relax       bar at the pool", "Date": "Jan 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR920615118", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "marcnice"}, {"Content": "Not Crazy About Dhyana Pura       Garden", "Date": "Jan 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR112020877", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "frangipanigirl"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d479531-r18412928-Dhyana_Pura_Beach_Resort-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "479531", "Price": "$70"}}
