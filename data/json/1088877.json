The apartments are in the Deira district of Dubai, but it is definitely within commutable distance, without being majorly expensive, to most places that you'd want to visit. It is also right next to a small shopping mall with a supermarket, so if you are staying for a long time you can stock up here. To be honest that's what I would do, as the food, although tasty- is slightly samey. That however, is the only thing that I could fault. My family of 2 adults and 2 little ones fitted in with oodles of room to spare, in a 1 bed apartment. The apartments are clean and well fitted, and the staff are probably the most attentive we had ever come across- and we travel very often. They were polite, courteous and when we asked them for anything (spare towels etc) they brought it to the room within 10mins. They also respected the do not disturb sign- phoning to our room to check if it was okay to deliver a hairdryer. That is something that has almost always been overlooked in Dubai hotels that I have stayed in before. We had a great weekend, the gym is huge, and the pool more than adequate. The location is fine, and there are plentiful taxis available right outside the hotel door. Oh and they have free underground parking.... almost unheard of in Dubai!!! All in all a fantastic weekend, and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again,", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "mumbai", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT HOTEL WITH HUGE ROOMS\u201d", "Author": "docviki", "ReviewID": "UR110313124", "Content": "Stayed for 6 nights in a 1bedromm apartment . pros : huge rooms well equipped kitchen good bathrooms with tub courteous staff decent pool hotel centrally located cons: limited choice of veg meatls", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGood Experience at Nojoum\u201d", "Author": "jannie8", "ReviewID": "UR103293679", "Content": "I reserved my room online through the Nojoum website, and even though I had to modify my reservation before I arrived, I had no trouble doing so online. I found the staff to be very helpful and courteous. The location was great and taxis picked up right outside the front door. I had a single apartment to myself, and the bedroom alone was the size of a standard hotel room. I also had a full kitchen and two bathrooms to myself. I wouldn't say the hotel is brandnew; there were small scuffs and such on the walls, but the apartment was nonetheless clean, modern and comfortable. I had the breakfast buffet one morning and it was decent for the price, with a nice variety of foods. Nothing spectacular, but definitely adequate. The hotel also offers a pool on the roof, which was nice after a long day. I would agree with a past poster that a drawback was having to pay for wi-fi, although I didn't notice a slow connection. I would also recommend the hotel to install a hair dryer in the bathroom. There is a lot of choice in Dubai for accommodation, but if you would like to stay in the Deira area, I would recommend this hotel and I will stay there again if I return to Dubai.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berks, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, don't expect 5 star\u201d", "Author": "solo_girl_traveller", "ReviewID": "UR92766825", "Content": "Its all true - there can be a noise problem, the service is hit and miss BUT overall the Nojoum Hotel Apartments are good value for money. The rooms and the apartment overall is of an excellant size with good self catering facilities. We went recently (Jan 2011) and found it very easy to travel about Dubai in taxis and on the tour bus. My Tips : -Take your own washing up liquid and cloths (then you don't have to buy them as they are not provided or pay extra to have your dishes washed). -Don't eat at the hotel -the food quality was poor. There is a Domino;s round the corner. Go out of the hotel and turn right stay on this side of the road and then right at the main road. -take ear plugs if noise bothers you - there is a bus stop right next to the hotel if you are using public transport- we didnt so can't comment on the buses! -do the desert safari trip.

Great place to stay with a very large lounge and kitchen. Each of the 2 bedrooms had 32inch flatscreen TV's although there are only 2 channels in English and one of them is BBC World News. Bedrooms are of a decent size and are en suite. Although the appartments are close to airport, once the balcony doors are shut, it is quiet enough. Beware of excessive traffic noise if you get a road side apartment. The only downside of our stay was the breakfast. My cornflakes were warmer than the cooked food. There is not much of a range. If you like eggs (cold ones at that) you will enjoy. But to be honest, there are only so many ways you can cook eggs. Steer clear from the hard boiled eggs as that is just what they are...hard boiled and of couse cold, even though they are suposed to be hot. The staff are extreemly pleasant and well dressed. Would stay again, although would prefer to eat out in the morning. Very close to a super and hyper market.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cBig Rooms\u201d", "Author": "davidbrown1939", "ReviewID": "UR50852762", "Content": "I had been booked in Nojoum online, I was surprise once I reach that the room are very big, food is not bad, location is very good near to Dubai free zone and alot of malls just 2 - 5 minutes walk.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Nojoum Hotel Apartments", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1088877-Reviews-Nojoum_Hotel_Apartments-Dubai.html", "Price": "$136 - $327*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Abu Baker Al Siddique Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Adjacent to Hamarain Shopping Center</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1088877", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ca/ef/caefb172826483ef6496d67dea80686e5large.jpg"}}
