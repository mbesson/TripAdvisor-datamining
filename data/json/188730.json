Everything about the hotel was exquisite so here are the main highlights: 1. Decor: As befits one of the top hotels in Paris, the Plaza Athenee was sumptuously decorated throughout with ornate French antiques, tapestries, crystal chandliers and breathtaking flower arrangements. The best way to describe the hotel's style is \"quiet luxury\". 2. Room: We were given Room 112 which was a junior suite with a king sized bed overlooking Avenue Montaigne. It was quite large and elegantly decorated in various shades of cream and pale gold with a dashes of hot pink and eggplant here and there. A platter of fresh fruit awaited us along with a handwritten note. They also offered to unpack our luggage. 3. Fitness Facility: Down in the Dior Spa area, there was a small but well appointed gym with several treadmills and elliptical machines from which one could watch tv or browse the internet. There was also a free weight area. In addition to complimentary fruit and water in the gym, there were sauna and steam rooms. 4. Service: The staff at the Plaza Athenee were exceptionally gracious and professional. As you can imagine, they all spoke excellent English and expertly attended to our requests for dinner reservations and help with taxis. 5. Food: Our breakfast of egg white omelets, whole wheat toast and coffee was delicious and promptly brought to our room within a very reasonable time of 20 minutes after placing our order. 6. Toiletries: These were custom made for the Plaza Athenee, plentifuland had a delicate white tea fragrance.

We stayed there 4 nights on the Paris leg of our trip. We stayed in a junior suite which was very spacious, with great amenities and a comfortable bed. The room had a king size bed, a seating area and a work station, with 1.5 bathrooms. Lots of closet space for people that like to unpack. The main bathroom had a separate shower and bath and was very spacious. There was also a nice powder room. We had an interior courtyard view, which was fine and probably made the room quiet, but I may ask for a city view next time. The hotel is completely over the top. From the moment you walk in, they treat you like royalty--with lots of people greeting you and asking you if all is well-- and it seems that they make it a point to learn your name. We had 2 people helping us to our room even though there were only 2 of us with one bag each. There was wine and a coffee cake waiting for us in the room. The conceirge and the reception staff made it a point to greet us every time we walked into the hotel was nice, but could be overwhelming at times. Continental breakfast at Alaine Ducasse was included with our rate. The breakfast was good, but if you go in jeans, you will feel underdressed. In fact, you will generally feel underdressed in jeans in the hotel--from the bar to the lobby lounge to breakfast at Alaine Ducasse. The hotel caters to a high-end clientele, so the atmosphere is very dressed up and all of their restaurant recommendations are also very high end. The recommendations were generally fine with us, but sometimes you just want a quaint cafe with good, easy food. Bottom line, I loved the hotel and would stay there again, but it is not an easy, laid back atmosphere.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff and location\u201d", "Author": "Roscoe2002", "ReviewID": "UR123235343", "Content": "Staying for four days on business and found the staff all incredibly nice and helpful", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cEuropean Tour, Plaza Athenee Paris\u201d", "Author": "CyrusE", "ReviewID": "UR122930881", "Content": "Being the second stop on mine and my family's twelve day european trip.

Where to stay one may ask?. So many new taunted instant classics came on the Hotel scene in Paris offering international flavors and the forever classics offer their incomparable location and years of perfecting the art of pampering guests. The Plaza Athenee became our instant choice. The location was among tour top reason for the stay, on Avenue Montaigne with the Fashion houses flagship stores , the Champs Elysees a few steps away and also the proximity ( and view for some suites) of the Eiffel Tower. That alone is an instant reminder when you wake up from the fog of jet lag where you are. Not too many hotels can offer that in Paris. My wife is also a 'Sex in the City \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 fan, if the Plaza was the choice for Carey for a place to stay in Paris, it had to be the one for us too. The arrival at the hotel offered the first greeting from doorman who welcomed us by name. We must have been among the few scheduled to check in early for that day and yet what a personal touch right there. Check in was expedient and very courteous. The sales manager Julie also came to the front desk to greet us. Right there, on the first impression, the Plaza differs from the other Palaces in Paris, no stuffy attitude from the staff and omnipresent fear that you are not quite dressed to the level of the secret dress code. One really feels instantly at home there. Our Suite was instantly available. From the batch of the newly renovated suite with the classical d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The first impression was to be welcomed in someone's home. That feeling is so rare nowadays when hotels spend fortunes with A list designers who focus more on overpriced decorative touches and exotic materials that could be found in New York, Singapore or Sydney than offering that touch that reminds you where you are. Classical french was our room. The television was also cleverly disguised as a old fashion mirror in a guilded frame that only appeared right in the middle of the frame when needed like magic thanks to the two way mirror. A Tv menu guide you through the maze of all the domestic and international channels offered catering to most languages. The Suite on the first floor faced the courtyard. This was not of importance to us since most of the daytime would be spent outside anyway and short of getting the Corner top floor suite with the view of Paris, how long does one spends at the window to watch the traffic passing by on the Avenue Montaigne? The King size Bed offered the right support with a choice of pillows. We could also order from the pillow menu to take care of allergy , firmness (or lack there of) and other fillings if needed. A rare feature in any hotel was the night lights setting that offer a safe mid night passage to respond to nature's call. The dressing cupboard was well appointed and offered ample room to unpack and stow our luggage away. The hotel had also offered the service of a maid to unpack for us if we wished so. There is a 110 V power outlet for the international visitor in need to re-charge their cell phones or other gizmos. The Bathroom was roomy and well appointed with among the largest bathtub ever found in a hotel (being 6 Ft 3, I could finally fit in !). The Shower located on the other side of the sink also offered the right amount of water pressure to take all the aches and pain from the travel away. The warm towel at the end was the best touch. Definitely need one Towel warmer rack at home ! You can leave your hair dryer home since one is provided by the hotel. The toilet offers the latest in Japanese technology for that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153after business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment. Most refreshing to say the very least ! Service is fast and efficient throughout our stay, a discreet light switch allowed for the room service to know that we were ready for the turn down of the bed. A quick stop by the House keeper also ensured that we had everything we needed for the night. Breakfast at the Plaza is a must. It takes place main dining room that over looks the Christmas decorated courtyard with the skating rink. The Pastries and bread selection was worth every penny. Freshly baked, it comes with it's own pastry dictionary to describe the different variations of croissants, chocolate roll and fruit filled pastries. The Jam selection also feature seasonal flavors like fig for our meal. Before leaving the hotel a stop at the Concierge desk offered the needed maps, advices, VIP passes for the Musee d'Orsay (that alone was the best given tip by the sales manager when we checked in. they even suggested the off peak time to get there. So Shopping could be done in the morning: a stop by the christmas windows of Le Printemps and Galleries lafayette, Exotic jams and teas at Fauchon and Hediard place de la Madeleine, Sailor knit sweaters at St James and of course a Macaron and gifts run at Laduree rue Royale. The Afternoon at the musee was as promised, no wait in line and lighter loads of visitors ( compared with an hour later when every tourist in Paris decided to come to the musee. Missing to the collection was unfortunately the magpie from Claude Monet ( a personal favorite). Also check for the dining room hours for lunch, do not even think to get in 15 minutes before the closing of the lunch window right before the tea service. The attitude was definitely Parisian ! Back to our cocoon for the end of the afternoon. I had arranged with the sales manager for a visit of other potential suites in preparation of our 25th wedding anniversary stay. The key element was to get a stay to remember. The hotel offers 2 main decorative themes: classic and the Art deco rooms, suites and apartment. The Title of :\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The room with The view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was found on the 8th floor in an Art Deco themed ( named the Suite Terrasse Eifel (room 888) with the panorama of Paris right in front of your eyes absolutely unobstructed. A private terrace offers yet a better setting for breakfast (weather permitting). The adjacent suite 889 also offers the view of the Grand dame of Paris. The Bar seems to be the place to be and be seen in Paris. We preferred the quieter tables in the corridor for a late Coffee and pastries watching the world go by. The home made chocolate ice cream is simply to die for (for the chocoholics out there) and the exotic fruits vacherin was simply divine. Our early departure forced us to get room service with the same breads , croissants and jams we had enjoyed the previous morning. The breakfast was delivered to the minute at the requested time. Checking out of the hotel was expedient and without fuss, the Luggage porter was in the room within minutes, the bill was ready at the desk and our Taxi was waiting to take us back to the airport. We have found our home away from home in Paris and would be hard pressed to try anything else!

My one complaint being when we first arrived, we sat down in the salon for a coffee/snack and were told we couldn't sit in the seats we had decided upon (prime seats in the middle of the salon). They escorted us to a back table by the elevator (practically in the hallway). I complained that the table was not acceptable so another employee came over and asked us if we were guests of the hotel. I replied yes and we were then seated us at another table in the corner that was ok but not as horrible as the one by the elevator. We definitely felt snubbed and considering we were paying close to $2000 a night, it seemed unnecessary and snobby seeing the other tables were available. Aside from that, the concierge is excellent and helped with our many requests. The breakfast in the dining room is wonderful and the room is beautiful. We had 2 massages and mine was quite good but my husband was not happy with his therapist. The spa facilities are quite nice and the steam/sauna are excellent.

The building is an interesting mix of Art Deco, Art Nouveau, classic French style and modern elements (bar, main dining room). The hotel has been gradually redecorated but has kept its charm. Like the sister hotel the Dorchester in London, all the public spaces are now occupied by bars or restaurants, which is unfortunate. You can hardly sit in the gallery or the courtyard and not eat or drink. Since I had a suite, this did not bother me too much, but it makes the place less relaxed than it should be. The room (Junior Suite) was superbly equipped (advanced lighting system, 115 TV stations, 24 radio stations) and had a view of the gorgeous inner courtyard (fountain, singing birds). Brown marble bathroom, also with courtyard view, elegant toiletries. I tried different options for food and drinks: a light lunch in the intimate gallery, lunch at the beautiful Relais Plaza (very ritzy and an Art Deco gem, good value for lunch), unusual drinks at the bar (great staff but the electronic menu is OTT and far too complicated to use). If you do not want to spend a fortune at the main restaurant (Alain Ducasse), you can just have breakfast there. While still expensive for a breakfast, it is great: beautiful menus and decor, unusual fresh juices, superior viennoisseries, toasted Poilane bread, Corsican honey, jams from Hediard (including one made for the PA with red currant and geranium), etc. Great service with the F&B manager present and visibly trying to do the best for the guests. The Dior spa is a great improvement and I loved the decoration. The new fitness is larger than it used to be, the saunas are good for a city hotel and there is a very nice relaxation area next to the reception of the spa. The level of service is consistently very high but I noticed a few minor slips since earlier stays: reservation agent not as good, no more call / visit by the housekeping after check-in to make sure everything is ok, unfriendly staff at the reception of the spa.

My wife and I had already spent about a week in the Plaza Athenee, a few years back, and had loved the place, and level of service, so it made sense to choose to go back. However, things did not start too smoothly... As we arrived by car, after quite a long journey, we were unable to drive up to the front door, as literally hundreds of people were crowding the pavement, holding pens and papers, waving cellphones ready to take photos. As it turned out, 'U2' was giving a concert in Paris, and happened to be staying at the Plaza. The doormen and concierges were overwhelmed by the crowd, and the cars were blocked by the crazed fans. After a very unpleasent few minutes of being trapped in our vehicle, we were finally rescued by one of the stylish doormen, who took away the car, and allowed us to run through the revolving doors, into the hotel. I had never seen the lobby so crowded before, taking away that all important feeling that you should get in a palace hotel, one of a tranquile, civilized retreat. But whole groups of people were just loitering, wandering aimlessly up and down the passage. Things only got worse when we arrived at the reception desk, to be told, apologetically, that our junior suite was not ready, and no other rooms were available for the moment. It was about 4o'clock. Not good. We were offered a complimentary drink, in the Hotel's bar in the foyer. We sat down at a little table, ordered Champagne, which was forgotten; asked again. The place was packed, resembling an airport lounge at times of big departures. Some of the U2 singers/players appeared, with their collosal bodyguards, and of course entering via a secret back door, leaving their fans without even the hope of a glimps. At this point, I was starting to regret having chosen the Plaza Athenee. Indeed, there are many beautiful hotels in Paris. We thought of the GeorgesV, very elegant, but lacks in authenticity, as many four seasons in big cities, they are a bit too standardized. The Ritz and the Crillon are wonderful properties, but are both in great need of renovation and up-dating. Then there was the Bristol, but a recent homicide took place there, between a young couple, roughly our age, which somehow put us off. The Meurice looked tempting, but not convenient for us, due to its location. So, Plaza Athenee it was. But right now, after this disastrous first impression, I realized that only a miracle would turn our stay into positive experience. And that is exactly what happened next. The very nice young man from reception came up to us, and told us that our room was still not ready. (It was coming up to 5'o clock by now). But, as an apology, would we accept to be upgraded into one of their Eiffel suite? Now, I had heard of those suites, they are a recent addition to the hotel , occupying the top floor of the building and is in fact a modern extension. There are about five or six of those enormous suites, mostly decorated in authentic 30's style, offering some of the finest accomodation in the whole of Paris, with unbelievable panoramic views of the 'old iron lady', which is how the French refer to the Eiffel tower. As we walked into the vast living room, with fabrics in subtle shades of grey, filled with valuable antiques, we were mezmorized by the sweeping views of the Paris roof-tops, and an entire, not a section, a whole Eiffel tower, shimmering in the hot july sun. A bottle of Champagne was brought in, with exquisit pastries, compliments of the hotel. Life started to be good again. We had made some appointements with the hotel's new spa by Dior, for a facial. The place, on the lower ground floor was predictably elegant, beautifully appointed, and the treatments, first class. Though I must just say that I find 180 euros for a facial, a bit steep in price, and could think of a few better ways to spend this amount. My wife disagrees. Back to the magical suite, where dusk was setting, we decided to dine in the hotel's smaller restaurant, the Relais Plaza. The main restaurant was closed, (Sunday), and anyhow, we really are not 'foodies'. We knew the Relais well, and love the setting, with it's traditional 1930's surrounds, based on the old cruise ship, 'The Normandy'. They now offer a very good value menu, at 44 euros, lunch or dinner, which is about the price of a single course in the \u00c3\u00a0-la-carte, reminding one that we are in the middle of a global recession, or, as the French tend to say ten times a day, 'La crise!' But we choose a la cart dishes, and they were good, but really not spectacular for the price. But the service is very stylish, and the pianist, a welcomed element, in a rather empty dinning room. We returned to our room, where our tower awaited, lit up like a christmas tree. Reasonably early night, as we had a long drive to Geneva the next day. Wonderfully comfortable bed, great choice of pillows from the pillow menu; alas I was woken up twice, by some utter idiots, bellowing drunkenly, from a nearby terrasse, (possibly staying at the hotel), reminding me that crass stupidity knows no social nor financial bounds. Next morning, a delightful breakfast table was wheeled in, and positioned by the bay window in the sitting room. And it was delicious. So we left, with stars in our eyes, ambitiously wondering what we needed to do to afford this 7500 euros suite, on a regular basis. But that's what dreams are for. Though I must say that when we stayed in a deluxe room, we enjoyed equally high levels of service. The Plaza Athenee is a truely unique place, with beautiful rooms, the best service, and glorious location. It also blends with perfection tradition and modernity. So, in our view, can we say that it is the best hotel in Paris?

While I have no problem with bored rich women (sometimes I wish I was one!) nor with high fashion which I actually love, I do have a problem with a hotel that promises to be \"the pulse\" of the fashion industry, \"the place to see and to be seen\", and in reality is stiff, BORING and far, far away from \"happening\". . PA has the same face like those women I was talking about: it is pretty, immaculately kept, but. What you are left with, is frustration and no joy of life. So if you are looking for this kind of atmosphere: an elegant, expensive stiff palace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you are much better off at the Ritz, which is by far more luxurious, historical and authentic then the Plaza Athenee, And if you are looking for the fashionable and glamorous Paris, go to Hotel Costes. in my point of view, Hotels that charge 600+ EUR a night for their least expensive room are not selling accommodation. They are selling an experience and in my opinion, Plaza Athenee does not deliver anything but nice accommodation and location. it is not the real thing and not worth the money", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFor the love of Paris!\u201d", "Author": "chiqa", "ReviewID": "UR23235379", "Content": "I rarely write reviews for the hotels I stay in, but I felt that after reading some of the previous negative comments on here(which almost discouraged me from staying at the hotel) and having loved my stay at the Plaza Athenee, that I had to write something! My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights over the New Year period and we both loved it! From the moment we arrived at the hotel to our departure, the service was impeccable! I have stayed in many hotels around the world and on occasions I know that sometimes hotel staff can be a bit too attentive and overbearing, or the complete opposite, but the staff at Plaza Athenee had it on point. We stayed in a junior suite which was on the 7th floor and it was the art-deco style, which may not be to some people's taste..but we found that the layout and decor of the room was lovely..the bathroom (which I personally think is one of the best things to judge a hotel on) was clean, beautiful and well equipped..but the best part of the room was the view!! We did request a view of Avenue Montaigne, and this was granted! We had two little balconies which gave us a stunning view of Avenue Montaigne and the eiffel tower! I would say it was a similar view to the one shown in SATC..it was simply breathtaking!! The atmosphere in the hotel was warm and friendly and during the festive period, the lobby was so so beautiful, with a huge Christmas tree and gorgeous decorations..I found the staff at the reception and concierge to be very accommodating and friendly..however if I were to be pedantic, a member of staff at the 'cashier's desk' was slightly moody looking..but that is a minor point. The food we ordered through room service was delicious, a very good choice of dishes and of a good standard, and generous portions. The breakfast service was excellent too, a good selection and the fruit was so fresh.. Also, the minibar in the room was well stocked, the best stocked minibar I have seen so far. We found that the location of the hotel was perfect for shopping and within walking distance of many places, and there were plenty of taxis on hand if needed, which were well arranged by the doormen. Overall, we found this hotel to be very very good..I think what makes it so appealing, are the little things they add which give it that 'personal touch' and it seems that they try to fulfil any requests which are made, which is good..We would definitely stay there again! Just to add..the prices are high, but realistically, that is to be expected for this type of hotel. Just to give a rough idea, a main dish for lunch/dinner from the room service menu averages at about 40 euros, the cheapest being a plate of pasta at around 24 euros.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "ajsue", "ReviewID": "UR21520150", "Content": "My wife and I spent four days at this great hotel at the end of October.

The hotel itself is beautiful & on the Madison of Paris if you like - just make sure to have a classical room. The problem with the hotel lies in the service level and management. Arrogant reception and just look at the chaos outside of the hotel - they are understaffed meaning that you rarely get prompt help parking your car or getting a taxi, this is a no no for a lux hotel. Just reading through reviews on here you will notice that a lot of people have to change rooms, they will without problem put you in a low ceiling 7th floor art deco nightmare. Instead of actually lowering the rates for these lesser rooms - they seem to have a policy of taking a chance you won't complain and if you will they will move you the next day (always the next day) and will have managed to reach the higher room rate for that night. Clever? Well in the end no, as not all people are that stupid. We all compare to what we are used to and if getting greeted by security staff and bar/lounge staff constantly impresses you this is sufficient - if you are experienced and looking for a true 5 star hotel; go to Ritz, Bristol, Crillion or George V instead. The bar is considered Paris hottest (although this is mainly true during fashion weeks) and Alain Ducasse extremely boring.

Our room was not ready when we arrived so we relaxed in the lounge drinking coffee. My first thoughts were what a beautiful hotel and how nice the staff were. 20 mins later we were taken up to our room which over looked the main courtyard, again very pretty. The room was amazing very comfortable and spacious. We returned from lunch to find champagne on ice as the hotel new it was my birthday, with a card. Very nice touch. On the day of my birthday (the sunday) the hotel left a Plaza Athenee box containing a chocolate tile with a crab on it (sign of July/Cancer) again very nice touch. The hotel must of known the atual date of my birthday from my passport they copied on arrival. Over all i would recomend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay there, great for special occasions.

Before arriving the concierge helped me book a table at Guy Savoy, their own restaurant Alain Ducasse, Benoit and Chez Eux. That saved me a lot of time! By the way all restaurants were excellent although Paris is getting very expensive... Benoit which has one star was really nice, relaxed in a very upscale traditional bistrot environment. But back to Plaza Athenee, the reception was nice, many of the staff learned my name. Bar is sensationally good, very beautiful people hang there you just have to live with a price for a drink of 25 Euro.. Bar has a cool design. In the courtyard they have a ice track so you can borrow skates and swirl around. Breakfast is 63 EURO so i decided to have a coffe and croissant at La Duree instead for a tenth of the price... The room was nice although the bathroom felt very small and the shower sprinkled water all of the bathroom when showering. I also think that a 5 star hotel should have seperate shower and bathtub which was not the case here. Toilet was small and the bathroom door blocked the toilet if open. Furniture in room was 4+ stars not 5. Bed was comfortable. I like when a hotel has a small cd collection to be able to play music in room but i did not find such collection without having to pay. So only a radio without pre set stations and finding a good one was difficult with 100 of stations. So please pre-set nice stations with news, classical music, jazz, pop, rock, hip hop, country and so forth. Location was great for shopping all the designer boutiques are on the same street as the hotel so you can just go back to the hotel with bags and continue shopping...:) So my overall impression is good service, location, rooms not up to a 5 star standard, little bit too expensive so value is below average.
