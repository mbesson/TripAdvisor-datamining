For the price paid (100Dhs for a night including room service) what more could one expect?

The bathroom although clean was not up to much as the hot water was either off or unavailable and there was no plug for the bath so it was a choice of shower or shower! The bed was comfortable and importantly the sheets were fresh. The Jockey Bar has, I believe, been unfairly slated in reviews on this site. Yes, there are certain ladies of ill-repute ( a varied selection at that :) ) that frequent the bar, but they will not approach you unless you make indications to them that you are \"looking for business\".

Compared to other budget hotels either in Bur Dubai or Deira, i found this one being the nicest. The location is fine since you are close to Malls and not far from the Beach Community ( Jumeirah, Umm Suqeim ). The rooms are acceptable and the staff will clean everyday and change the towels and sheets. The room air conditioning can be noisy, however and since i always sleep with ear plugs i could sleep well. The beds are confortable. If i have an advise to give you, when booking either on the phone or through the internet, ask for a top floor room ( there is six floors in the Panorama Bur Dubai ), you will still hear the loud music from the Jockey's Club, but less than if you would stay on the first three floors ( actually i can barely imagine how people could stay a single night on the lower floors...). The staff is effective so is the room service, the food is good when you order to your room and delivered within twenty minutes. The breakfast at the restaurant downstairs is vey basic and still acceptable for the price. The Jockey's Club at the lobby entrance is a nice place for a drink, howvere be aware that it is a pick-up point which mean that there is a lot of chinese, philippinas hookers, however they will not bother you unless you ask for it.... The Philippino girl at the reception and as far as my experience in this hotel, is very unpleasant, she would not even say good morning nor smile, and look at you like if you were not paying the price for staying there... Perhaps she should join the Jockey's Club for a couple of nights....", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel - but you get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "azzy786", "ReviewID": "UR18565523", "Content": "the room had a kind of stale smell to it. that was probably because of the air conditioning that had'nt been cleansed or serviced in years (if at all).

I found the bathroom appauling as it was sub-standard, the shower had a leak and there were many moths/misqito type insects and fleas flying around in the bath. so pretty disgusting. The nice philipino girl on the desk is helpful. Good thing about the hotel is the location; bus stop to city/airport within 2 mins walk, major shopping mall with Mc D's and KFC (both open till late) also next door.
