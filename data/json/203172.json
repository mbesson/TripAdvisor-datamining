For example, Spanish steps is suppose to be 10 min walk and it took me about 25 minutes to get there and I wasn't taking my time either. The trevi fountain is only a good 10 min walk from the Spanish steps and the colosseum is probably a good 20 minute from the trevi fountain. the train and metro is a 15-20 minute walk. However, the bus stop is right down the block to the left which made it convenient to get to places. The rooms were pretty small but not a big issue. As for noise, i didnt have a problem but my room wasn't at the front of the building as every reviewers was saying. Daily breakfast included cereal, coffee, tea, (cappuccino - has to be specially ordered). Scrambled eggs, bacon, assorted ham and cheese, pastries, bread, toast, butter & jelly. my last stay they had hard boiled eggs as well. I honestly didn't mind the breakfast but I can see how it can become sickening after eating the same thing day after day. I was advised by the receptionist of the hotel to take the bus the colosseum and the vatican. I had a tour booked with viator.com for both sites. I took the #60 bus to the colosseum and it was perfect made my tour in good time. However taking the #492 bus the colosseum was a big mistake. It took About 45 minutes to get there and missed my tour! I was then told by the tour people that the metro would have been better because it's only 5 stops as oppose to the bus which was 15+ stops. The hotel sells single ride bus passes at the front desk which were convenient. Tip eat at mamma Angela's about 10 min walk from hotel ask if they can make a reservation for you as well because it's always packed. Good affordable, homemade food, no ridiculous bread charge.

The decor and furniture in both the communal areas and the bedroom was fairly low standard and did not look as if had been updated much in the last 20 years. The bedroom was small, dark, old-fashioned, with artificial flowers that had clearly been there for many years, plastic cups rather than glasses, a full ashtray on the window-ledge, and a TV that didn't work properly. It was also pretty noisy during the night. The breakfast was basic at best, very limited choice, no fresh fruit, and the furniture on the much-hyped terrace was like basic garden furniture. Nice views on the terrace, and the one receptionist we spoke to the most was helpful and pleasant. It is not in the 'central' area of Rome, it is probably at least 20 minutes walk to the shops/Spanish Steps/TrevI Fountain area, and although there are a few nice restaurants on the Via Flavia, it is pretty quiet and you are far from being in the 'hub' of Rome.

Book a private car through Limousine Systems online. 45 minutes to and from Fiumicino airport from the hotel. Everything went well and the contact is through Tina Hernandez. It beats all the scamming by taxis in Rome and all contact/reservation can be done online. We had no problems and recommend this service. The front desk speaks perfect english, and all were good, but special commendations to Lorella and Medi. They were especially friendly, helpful, and made our trip easy. We booked a family suite #416 and #418. They were connected with separate bathrooms, and two twin beds in each room. Beds were firm like I them. The rooms have older furnishings and finishings. But super clean, and prices are reasonable. Excellent maid service. Would be a 3 star hotel based on furnishings, but I would rate it 4 stars overall for all its other positives. All bathrooms were fully stocked with clean towels, shampoo, soap, moisturizer, hair dryer. They are tiny and awkward. Only 1 person can use at a time. The hotel has free breakfast every morning. Bacon, eggs, cold cuts, fruits, milk, yogurt, cereal, pastries, great red orange juice, coffee, tea. Plenty to eat but has the same items each day but will save you 50 euros a day on breakfast and time. The free wifi is good but is most effective in the early morning and later evenings. Internet traffic must affect its signals. Location is away from the traffic and noise. Neighbourhood is safe. Have to walk 20 minutes to Trevi Fountain, and Villa Borghese. 10 minutes to Termini station. Rome is a walking city. Can walk to all sites and see the beautiful homes and Italian life. Don\u2019t bother with hop on and hop off buses, just ask the front desk on the public buses and they go by all the sites for 1 Euro each person each way. If I was to do it again, I would walk to all the sites, and just take the bus back. The subways are too far away from the sites. Buses are safe and saw no pickpocketers at anytime in Rome. Food nearby at La Taglio Pizza right across the front entrance of hotel. La Locanda da Bacco is on Via Flavia(same street as hotel) has great food. Any item on menu is good. Other restaurants in area we tried but food was either not good or too expensive. Service at any restaurant(or retail stores) in Italy is not as good as Canada. I Caruso is on Via Collina just on the corner has great fresh made Gelato. Order a tub instead of single samples as it is more cost effective. Also use a Persian market on Via Flavia which has the most reasonable prices on juice, water(you will need lots of water), and fruits. The tourist sites in Rome are awesome. But be prepared to see a filthy city. There are smokers everywhere so there is not much fresh air, and cigarette buttes are everywhere. Rome is full of spitters, litterers, and dog feces. So watch where you are stepping. Public bathrooms in restaurants and other facilities are dirty, and most have no toilet seats on the toilets, bring your own soap/sanitizer, and toilet paper. Bring money as Rome is expensive. Hope this helps everyone. It is not clean and friendly like Canada, but one has to come see Rome.

For anyone reasonably fit all the main sights are within walking distance, Trevi Fountain 20 mins, Spanish Steps 25 mins, Colloseum 25 mins, Vatican or Trastevere 1 hour, If you can do it, walking is certainly the best way to see Rome, otherwise a 2 day pass on the red \"110 Open Bus\" is a good way to get about. There are a number of nearby restaurants, we tried La Locanda di Bacco and Pentolaccia, both good. Reception was friendly with good English. Our room 514 was high up at the back so no street noise at all. The room was fairly small but nicely presented, carpets looked brand new and although the bed at first felt rock hard it was surprisingly comfortable and with really good pillows. The bathroom was large with a shower cubicle rather than a bath, (this suited us) and had been recently refurbished. The Hotel is clearly keeping up good standards of maintenance in the rooms and public areas. The roof top bar and garden has panoramic views including St Peters, but is the only bar in the hotel so hope for fine evenings. Barmen Salvatore and Dalio were excellent, first class service with a good sense of humour. Prices were a little high on the roof, 8 Euro for a beer, 14 Euro for G&T or an Amaretto, 8 Euro for a glass of wine. Mini Bar in the room was much cheaper, 5 Euro for a beer. Breakfast is also served on the roof but in a covered area so no problems with weather. Choices are the usual bacon & eggs, cold meats, fruits and cereals and some hard to resist Italian chocolate cake. All the staff we dealt with were very friendly polite and helpful, taxis appeared within about three minutes. Just one man we took a dislike to, possibly management? ( large sun glasses and permanent fag in mouth) who chastised us like naughty children for offering a peanut to an inquisitive Pigeon on the roof.

Not a bad little hotel, away from the main hustle of Rome. Check in was quite efficient and our room was ok, although was quite dark as it had shutters on the windows that would not stay open and our window looked out onto the wall of other buildings. The roof terrace was too cold to use in March and as there isn't another bar we ended up getting our drinks and taking them down to the reception to drink which was ok but not ideal, also the drinks are very pricey, if we had realised how expensive we would have stayed at the restaurant where we had dinner for after dinner drinks. Breakfast was ok if you only want continental breakfast, wasn't over impressed with their cooked breakfast but maybe we have been spoilt by british hotels full english. The restaurant overlooks the rooftops of Rome which sounds idealic but in reality is a view of more satelite dishes than you can count. We visited all the usual tourist traps and had a guided tour of the Vatican which we prebooked with Viators which was really good and well worth the money as our tour guide was really good and it enabled us to beat the queues, however we also booked a selfguided tour which was good as we wanted to backtrack over some of the things we had seen with the Viator guide but if you are not with a tour guide you cannot follow exactly the same route which was a bit annoying. St Peters is huge and everything is Rome is enormous. Visited the Colleseum but was more impressed by the one that we had seen in Tunisia. The Roma pass is well worth getting as it covers all your travel on the Metro and the buses, if you have only every been on the London Underground you MUST experience the Rome Metro, it only has 2 lines, A and B but they are very efficient and the buskers on them have to be seen. Castel S'Angelo is worth a visit although thier coffee shop is expensive as is everywhere in Rome for eating and drinking. A lot of the museums etc are shut on Mondays which is worth noting if you are on a short break and want to see as much as possible don't include Monday as a day to visit attractions.

Our room (#326) was ready at 10 in the morning when we arrived and the service throughout the stay was great.

Each day was the same, but that is usually the case in buffet-style breakfasts: eggs, bacon, bagels, tea, free cappuccino, fresh juice, yogurt and muffins. No fresh fruit, but not much is in season in November so we were happy with canned peaches. We were catching a cruise out of Civitavecchia (the port about an hour from Rome), so we took the train to the port, also, which was an easy and uneventful experience ( 7 euros each versus $100 USD for shuttles or cabs) It can be challenging getting heavy bags off the steep, narrow train stairs alone, though, so be prepared.

The room was larger than average on the 6th floor (616) It was furnished to a high standard and was immaculately clean. The beds were on the firm side, but that, obviously, is a personal choice. It was the little touches that counted, such as the turn down service, complete with sweets left on the pillow and a little card wishing us a goodnight's sleep. The staff were very friendly, in particular Salvatore,Marco and Manuel. The girls on the desk (sorry-didn't get your names) were very helpful with directions and suggestions. Not to mention the Italian lessons! Breakfast was more than adequate. Cereals, fruit (fresh) yoghurts,various breads,cakes, croissants, cold meats, cheese, scrambled eggs and bacon, toast, not to mention coffee and various teas. The service was excellent with plates cleared away quickly, but you were not rushed. I got the impression that it was very much a family run hotel, with 'family' checking that everything was running smoothly - which it was - like clockwork, The roof terrace was delightful be it for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just a drink. We made use the terrace as often as we could as the views were wonderful, particularly the sunsets over St Peter's. The hotel is not too far from the main attractions. The stop for the city hop-on tour bus is a 10 minute walk away, the tickets for this can be bought from the hotel reception desk. There are a few restaurants close to the hotel and a cash machine. As two women travelling alone, we felt completely safe. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and indeed intend to return one day.

I had chosen it based on the comments here on TripAdvisor, but you never know what you're going to get until you arrive. Fortunately, I was not disappointed. It is a great value for your money. I had to wait about a half an hour for my room, but they upgraded me from a single room to a double at no extra cost, which was great. I had a nice, quiet room (214) at the end of the second floor, which was small, but suited my needs perfectly. The room was recently revovated so it was very modern and clean, with a super comfortable bed, and a terrific bathroom and shower. The wi-fi for the most part worked very well in the room and throughout the hotel although it was not as reliable late at night. The multilingual staff at the front desk were all very knowledgeable and helpful. On my first day, they recommended a fabulous restaurant (La Pentolaccia), which was by far my favorite restaurant during the trip. The 7th floor patio was also exceptionally nice. The breakfast is basic, but again, it suited my needs perfectly with eggs, bread, cheese, pastries and other items. It was definitely better than just a regular continental breakfast. After a long d of ay of sight seeing it was always nice to visit the patio for a late-night drink. Salvatore who serves the drinks is an absolute sweetheart! He will keep you entertained and give you lots of helpful tourist advice if you need it. The hotel location is perfect and it is very easy to walk to most locations like the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. The Vatican is a bit further, but very easy to reach with the local transportation. And if you're up for a nice long walk, it's very doable. I walked back from the Vatican to the hotel stopping at the Pantheon and the Piazza Navona on the way and it was fine. As a female traveling solo, it was very important that I felt safe, and the hotel is in a great area and not once during my walks around town did I feel worried. An great trip overall and I have to thank the Marcella Royal for making it such a special one. I look forward to staying here again. P.S.: Just a warning, if you are taking a cab from FCO airport, make sure you get a licensed cab with a meter. I was charged a $75 flat rate when I should have paid $40-50.

The Terrace is a perfect place to re-charge your batteries after a day of sightseeing or coming back from dinner at the numerous places to eat. Piazza Narvona - Dolce Vito I would highly reccommend. Osteria next to the Trivi Fountain is another lovely place to eat. YOU MUST like walking. Rome is small compared to alot of cities and the best way to travel is to walk. Advisable to have an Open Bus Tour. we got the '110' 2 day pass for 18 Euros each... they are all much of a muchness. Great way to get your barings and to see the sights. The Spanish Steps are beautiful also. Shopping is expensive and so is eating out, however, look around, there are places suited to every purse.

It was wonderful. It was hot 29', but not sticky. If you go to the Vatican, I would reccommend that you have a pre-paid guided tour. (book this on the internet before you go). There is so much History that you will not be able to take it all in, however it does give you a great insight to the histories that surround it. Well worth the money.

So short shorts are a no no and cover up the shoulders with a small shawl. There is always someone around to sell you this outside for a few Euros.

Multilingual staff are friendly and helpful, and the rooms are very clean and spacious, if a little old fashioned in the decor. Air con works fine, showers are hot etc. A lovely gesture was when the roses we had bought and put in a plastic cup from the bathroom were put in a vase by the maid when we were out. Breakfast is the sort of standard you would expect to be charged extra for, lots of variety (pastries, cheese, meat, cereal toast etc) and always plenty even if you don't get there till 9.40. Bacon and eggs was a nice surprise. Lovely view from the restaurant, can see over all the houses, there is a view of st paul's and the sunset is lovely. Only ate there one night as the food and drinks are more expensive than in the restaurants surrounding the hotel. Nice for a coffee though. The hotel is not RIGHT in the centre, but it is only a short walk from the Trevi fountain (15 mins), and the train station in the other direction (5 mins). We got around fine by walking and occasionally catching the metro to get to the sights which are a bit further out like the Colosseum. Really easy and we saw everything we wanted to. If you do choose to stay here I would really recommend the restaurants in the area. One in particular is il sorriso just opposite the hotel. Very simple, lovely italian food, (my boyfriend said the steak was the best he ever had) set menus from 14 euros, friendly staff (especially the younger girl who works there) and little extras such as a plate of biscotti and a glass of house wine which come with the bill. So nice we went back on the last night. It surprises me that there are any bad reviews for this hotel, none of them reflect our experience and some of them are downright weird. (a ghost?)

Second, within the time we went from checking in to going to our room our passports got stolen. The staff was very unhelpful (they were more helpful to the woman who needed to change her hair appointment). We spend our first night walking to the local police station (which was not 15 minutes away like the staff said). However, after throwing a fit and continually raising the issue with the staff and Pino the bellhop (who when we asked about the people we thought may have taken them, all of the sudden didnt speak English), we found all three passports (minus a missing map) under the the bed spread of the bed we did not have a chance to undue (this is after Pino indicated that we would find the passports in our room). Third, the roof top garden is nice and the breakfest is nice. However if you get seconds, leave someone behind because the wait staff is quick and will clear your stuff and papers before you get back. Finally, the room was small with a nice bathroom, and had cable tv with a few channels in English. The view was into the into an inner court yard facing other buildings so we kept the window closed.

The room we had was large, clean, comfortable and furnished to a very high standard. The walls were not papered, but covered in silk fabric with a thin layer of padding underneath - quite exotic really. The staff were extremely helpful, we lost our camera and the reception staff did more than could be expected to try to recover it. When that proved to be impossible they sorted out what needed to be done to report the matter for insurance purposes and phoned several police stations for us to ensure that we found English speaking officers to deal with the situation. The air con in our room failed, and though this may be seen as a problem, it was dealt with quickly and efficiently. The staff moved our belongings to another room for the night, repaired the unit, then moved us back into our original room whilst we were out during the day. Mechanical problems happen, but the way that this was dealt with minimised it to the level of a very minor irritation. The roof terrace at the hotel is magical. For a pre-dinner cocktail or an after dinner drink, it is wonderful. The view over the city skyline, whilst not beautiful in the conventional sense, is amazing and St Peters Basillica can be seen in the distance. The bar staff were always smart, friendly and helpful. There were several bars and restaurants locally, but not in the numbers that are found in the tourist centres. This is reflected in the fact that I have only awarded 4 out of 5 for location. Some places of interest, like the Trevi Fountain, Piazza Berberossa and the Pantheon were within easy walking distance but Piazza Navona and the Vatican required the use of public transport. However a bus stop was situated within 300 yards of the hotel and fares were cheap with tickets on sale at the hotel reception. The walking situation was not helped by the fact that we chose to marry in July and so have to celebrate our anniversary then. Temperatures of 96degrees F do not encourage walking and we would have probably walked more if it had been cooler. The price we paid seemed quite reasonable and probably reflects the location of the hotel relative to the sites of the city.

It is quiet on an evening but quite a walk to the main attractions. I'd say about 20 minutes at a leisurely pace. Maybe too much for some. It suited us as the quietness on an evening made up for it. The hotel has a roof bar which is excellent on a nice evening. Very impressive. We were going to eat in the piano bar on our last night but we were the only people in the whole place which put us off a little to say the leaset so it was just a drink and then out.

The location of the hotel is not centrally located, but we found it was convenient for walking to the train station and to a tour bus pickup location.

You can ask the hotel staff for recomendations on places to eat and they will point you in the right direction one place i would recommend is on the same road as the hotel and is called 'annicinquanta pizzeria' which has great food for a good price, and is full of local italians with queues out of the door which is a good sign. Rome is a beautiful city with lots to see and do. One minute you can walk through and beautiful market place and then the next street can be full of boutiques. the people are very friendly and hospitable. Be very careful with your wallet and pick pocketers, also keep away from quiet streets. The metro underground is pretty basic but gets you about, Stay away from cabs if you can because they are dodgy,the meter was clocking up as we were getting into the car. Our flight was the early hours of the morning so we had the hotel arrange a cab at a set price which i would recommend.

We booked this hotel after reading numours excellent reviews on trip advisor, and we where not dissapointed!! We arrived from Dublin into Leonardo Da Vinci airport and took the Leonardo express into termini, we decided to brave it and walk from the station to the hotel with the help of our guide book, the walk with suit cases (Make sure you have one on wheels, they are a god send) was about 15 minutes. The hotel is located on a quiet side street just off a main road, and is very quiet. The staff were very welcoming and we where shown to our room by the porter who brought up our bags a few minutes later. We were giving a different map with all the main attractions on it they also marked things like good restraunts, and a supermarket on it for us! Our Room (Standard Double) was on the 4th floor and was newly refurbished, state of the art bathroom features the lot! The rooms where spotless and was cleaned every day new towels and sheets. The nearest Metro station is Republicca About 7 mins away and is serviced by the metro line A wich goes in the direction of the trevi fountain/vatican/spanish steps however Termini is just an extra 2 minutes walk and is serviced by both lines A&B (B going towards the ancient city) I would advise to get a Biglietto giornaliero B.I.G it's a days travel on the metro and Bus and costs \u20ac4 - the 3 day one costs \u20ac11. The Hotel has a lovely breakfast room on the 7th floor, with amazing views over the city St. Peters Basilica is visible over the roof tops. Breakfast is ample to set you up for a day of adventure, with cerals, toast, cold meats, tea and coffee, ( I had a chocolate Crossant every morning too, :)!) There is a lovely little Pizzeria right across the road, lovely fresh and well priced! other than that all the restraunts are amazing and the receptionist will reccomend a few.

And since we didn't plan on spending much time in the hotel room anyway, it really worked out well for us. The upstairs roof deck provided a wonderful view of the skyline in the morning.

Infomation places shut at 12 noon till 2.30 so ask police for Directions or Hotel staff..... Best Restruants and Top class Hotels are away from the Busy Tourist Spots...... To find some of these these Travel up to the Northern area from the Hotel, its Main street is the Via Vittorio, its just south of the Villa Borgnese Park /the big Green Area on any map. This Hill/ street is full of the best Restruants we found all week, the Food was fantastic the Service was excellent with seats outside with Fans spraying cool mist out, this was the only one we ate at, on our last night, do yourself a favour Find it.....Wish we had earlier...All the Others looked just as good. The 5 star Hotels on this street are Awesome and we saw pictures outside them of Famous Stars who had stayed and ate there. Micheal Caine etc...Great shops at the top of the street too! If you go all the way to the top and want piece and quiet go in the Park its safe and Police are every where just for you... We walked through and saw couples all over the park Kissing and cuddling. Plenty of privacy and water Fountains for your feets to cool off. If you want to go on a night tour Bus? (recommended) pick the best one not the cheapest as you wont see anything and they dont stop often... Check them all out as you walk the streets you will see them, our bus was tatty inside and a little disorganised. We are going back to the Macella Royal Hotel for its Quality of service, quality of Rooms and Location away fom the hustle and bustle of the busy streets.....Chamber maid was excellent and two visits a day were made with little notes on the pillows each time....Enjoy, give our regards to the great Barman 'Salvatori' what a guy. He called me Mr Tony Hey its Italy.........Enjoy!!!!!", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Get About in Rome\u201d", "Author": "walshy13", "ReviewID": "UR18339410", "Content": "What a super hotel.

We were a little late with the booking (approx two months prior to our trip), so the choice in good hotels were limited. Chose this one after reading so many great rewievs here at tripadvisor. At the time we booked, there were only one room avaliable for our entire stay. This was a superior room, which the hotel charges \u20ac350 per night for. We booked through expedia.com and paid far less:-) Upon arrival we checked in and were taken to our room. We got room 618, which was the third largest room in the hotel. It had a bathroom with shower/bathtub, a small hallway with lots of warderobe space, a fairly large \"main\" area with a big bed (which was quite comfortable), and a small narrow space by the window with a desk and minibar/fridge. And a great view of the Roman rooftops! Overall, the room was clean and nice. However, I would like to point out that the wall-to-wall carpet was extremely dirty... Other than that - no complaints. The room was cleaned once a day, clean towels were provided each day, they changed the sheets several times during our stay, and they checked the room in the afternoon as well (made up the bed if needed etc). Although our room was at the sixth floor, we did not experience any noise from the rooftop garden at any time of day. The room was located beneath the inner corner of the breakfast room, but we had no problems with loud noises from people walking over the tiled floor above, chairs being dragged etc as complained about in other reviews. In the outdoor area, the had put litle rubber \"cups\" on the chairs - probably to reduce the noise. In general the hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood, and we slept very well through the night - even with the window open. The price you pay for a quiet location, is that the hotel is located a bit far from the tourist places in Rome. The Pantheon is approx a 30 min walk away. This was not a problem for us as we are used to walking. Also, we did in general leave the hotel after breakfast and did not return until the evening. But if you want to break up your days and return to the hotel to relax during the day, you might want to look for a hotel with a more central location. On the positive side, the metro station Republicca is jus 5 - 10 minutes down the road which is convinient when going to the Vatican city and Colusseum. Also, there are several nice little places to eat right by the hotel, so you can easily go back to the hotel without having dinner and then find something to eat just around the corner. The staff was friendly and helpful and fluent in english. The rooftop garden was great, nice place to relax, do some reading or just enjoy the view. Spent some time up there during the day, and were left alone by the staff - no pressure to buy anything. We did not go up there to sit down any evenings, the policy might be different that time of day. It was really nice being able to eat breakfast outside at the rooftop terrace. In general, finding an avaliable table outside was not a problem. But in case of bad weather they do also have tables indoors. The breakfast itself was fair enough, nothing out of the ordinary. The hotel state that they offer complimentary wireess internet connection. However, they charge \u20ac 8 for 30 minutes (you buy codes in the reception) . This is extremely expensive, I've paid the same amount for 24 hour access in other hotels. Despite the price, we bought access for 30 min. Went up to the room to go online on our private laptop, but it did not work. Then went down to the reception area to try the hotel laptop, but it still did not work. Got help from the staff, but they didn't manage to get it working either. Got the money back without problems, so the service was good at least. But the \"complimentary\" wifi access is expensive and unreliable and something you should just avoid. All in all, our stay was just fine.

Indeed what better way to start a day than to have a nice breakfast with the same views. OK, the nitty gritty. You will need walking shoes although don't be afraid to use the metro/buses and taxis. The hotel bar is not cheap so expect to pay more euros for a beer than in many local restuarants (approx 8). A bottle of wine is better value! The rooms are fine if a little small and we were on the sixth floor but were not disturbed by the noise from the restuarant above. There is no iron so bring your own.

You can also take a train from the airport to the main station Termini, it\u2019s cheaper, but you will need to take 10-15 minutes walk to the hotel with a map. Restaurants. I wonder why Italians are not fat as they eat so much! You will have Antipasti first, and then have pasta or lasagne and after that they will ask you about the Main course (Steak, fish, whatever you like) and only after the main course you can have your dessert! I recommend you to only go to nice restaurants because prices are pretty much the same everywhere. Wine is very good in Italy; we always had it with a meal. Be careful crossing streets in Rome, it can be dangerous. Rome is a very special and extremely beautiful place to go to.

Like many, I chose the hotel based on the many favorable reviews, and in general I agreed with them. The staff were extraordinarily gracious and pleasant, and the hotel was very clean. Overall, good value for money and a pleasant stay. A few things to note: (1) There is a fair amount of variation in room size. I arrived quite late (11 pm) on check-in day, and was given the only room still available - I don't recall the room number, but it was so exceedingly small (even by European standards) that I could barely fit my suitcase in the room, and there was a rather drab view of the building across the street. I noticed a floor plan on the room wall and could see based on the room diagrams that I was in the smallest room on the floor. I called the staff to request a room change - they were very accommodating and moved me to a new room the next day - same price, but much larger room, plus a lovely view across the city rooftops (see photo). So - make sure you get the best possible room in your category. (2) The location will be a plus for some and a minus for others. It's definitely in a residential neighborhood - VERY quiet (I slept extremely soundly) and not particularly touristy. For those who enjoy walking and/or want the feel of living in a Roman neighborhood, it's great. It's not particularly close to any of the main tourist sites, though. The staff tell you that Piazza di Spagna is a 15-minute walk - I'm a pretty fast walker, and I really couldn't get there in less than 25 minutes. Other main sites (Forum, Pantheon, Colosseum, etc.) are further still. For me, this was a non-issue - I didn't care about seeing the tourist sites and quite enjoyed walking through the residential streets each day. But some may see the location as a bit out of the way. (3) One small complaint: there is no iron available in the room, or anywhere in the hotel. So, if your clothes are wrinkled from travelling and you need to press them, the only option is to send them out through the expensive laundry service, which takes a day or two. This may be an inconvenience for business travellers in particular - as I arrived late the evening before a conference, I had no way to press my clothes before the next day. (4) A final tip: there is a delightful little family restaurant just down the street called \"La Pentolaccia\". Very reasonable prices, delicious traditional Italian food (the cacio e pepe and the ossobucco were particularly good).

I wanted to write this review to let future guests know a few things I hadn't seen mentioned: First, when you book, you may not want to be on the 6th floor if you don't want to wake up early. The sixth floor is directly under the tiled breakfast area, and the noise from breakfast prep -- footsteps, noisy scraping chairs, tables -- starts at about 5 a.m., and IT'S LOUD! Second, avoid booking a tour through the hotel concierge, unless they switch tour recommendations and dump Carrani Tours as their primary preference. We made reservations for a Vatican Museum tour through the hotel, because we weren't able to get them in advance and wanted to avoid the long lines during Holy Week. But this has to be the worst tour of the Vatican Museums in existence. It should have been advertised as \"20-minute visit to the Sistine Chapel with a side trip to the gift shop\" Basically, the tour consisted of a bus ride to the museum, lots of time spent standing around while the group waited for its tickets, followed by a dash through the hallways to the Sistine Chapel, 20 minutes in the chapel and a dash back to the bus and the gift shop. Fortunately, my family knew enough about the museums to leave the tour group before it went through the exits ... This is not a tour for anyone who wants to actually SEE the Vatican Museums. If you want to book a reservation, contact the Vatican directly roughly two- to four-weeks before your trip, visiteguidate.musei@scv.va Or, if you really want to take a guided tour of the Vatican Museums, do your research and find another company besides Carrani.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "essex", "Title": "\u201cA Royal Gem\u201d", "Author": "BAC42", "ReviewID": "UR14957222", "Content": "Booked this Hotel partly due to Favourable reviews on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed .

There is a beautiful roof terrace to have your buffet breakfast, or indoors, still with panoramic views. The breakfast was great - a continental type, but still came with bacon and scrambled eggs which pleased my husband no end! It certainly sets you up for the day! At night the roof terrace turns into a romantic 'piano' bar. To be honest, the pianist was awful and played only 'elevator music' badly. He looked and sounded like he wished he wasn't there and didn't interact with the few customers that were there. However, the really nice barman made up for it as he was so pleasant. We were only having a quick drink before heading off to dinner and maybe on the way back, its not the type of bar I'd stay at. For reference it was \u20ac6.00 for .4l or beer and \u20ac4 for a glass of wine. This rates as about the same you'd pay at the expensive cafes on the piazzas.

For a four star hotel I would expect not to have to walk around all crumpled!!! On the whole though I was pleased with our choice, but if I was going again I would stay nearer the Trastevere area as it oozes charm and eating and drinking are very good and very reasonably priced. Tips for Rome - bring walking shoes, go on the open top bus first and get you bearings its great, go to the Cisten Chapel later rather than earlier as there is NO queue, but it does take an hour minimum to walk to the chapel once you get inside the vatican museum, so time it well as they close early afternoon. The best thing we did was bring binoculars, everyone borrowed them!! If you go up to the Capitol and look down on the Forum its brill and also for the ceiling of the Cisten Chapel. There's loads of restaurants near the hotel, but I felt ill after eating at the first one on the right coming out of the hotel. Apart from feeling ill it was the only restaurant we didn't enjoy on our trip. We highly recommend the pizzeria/restaurant further down the road on the right hand side, it brightly lit so you wont miss it, with tables outside, is reasonbly priced and packed with locals and travellers alike. I threw a coin the in Trevi fountain twice so with a bit of luck I'll get back to Rome a couple more times.

The hotel staff were at all times friendly and courteous and would go out of their way to be helpful. Our room was beautifully decorated in gold brocade fabric, double glazed and air conditioned and equipped with TV and minibar. The beds were bliss and were always beautifully made. The bathroom was perfectly equipped: toilet, bidet, washbasin, bath, shower, hair drier, big mirrors and lots and lots of soft white towels. Our room was at the front of the hotel and since my sinuses do not cope well with air conditioning, I prefered to sleep with it off and the windows open. The road outside could be noisy from about 6am but if the windows were closed, outside noise was not a problem. The roof top garden, breakfast room and bar were very pleasant indeed. Breakfast was self service but the layout meant that guests did tend to get into each other's way at peak times. It was nevertheless delightful to start the day with plenty of good food, fresh air and a panorama of the city. The roof garden was often deserted in an afternoon and provided a quiet and comfortable retreat after a long walk round the city.

Overlooking the city, with views of St.Peters dome, it was a real pleasure to relax after a day spent walking miles in 37oF and sip a cocktail or two. Breakfast, during the summer, is also served out on the terrace .. lovely. The reception staff are very helpful and always put us in the right direction (shopping/transport links/restaurants etc).

There is plenty of good restaurants right around the hotel. If you are young and looking to go out you should go to Campo De Fiori - bars, pubs and clubs. A great place to go for dinner is Piazza Navona - it is an area not an actual restaurant. There are so many restaurants in and around that area.

I was a little disappointed on arrival to be told that no upgrade was available even though I was brandishing the written confirmation. However, the room we had (644) was extremely comfortable with a street view but no balcony. But it was a nice touch (maybe a conciliatory one?) to find a very pleasant bottle of chilled Prosecco waiting for us when we returned from the Spanish Steps that night. We didn't eat in the hotel at night, so can't comment on that, but the front desk recommendations were generally very good. Hotel location is mercifully quiet in such a vibrant city, but a little way out from the centre - however it's only 20 - 25 mins walk to the Colosseum. We didn't walk to St Peter's, but I'd guess at 45 mins to an hour? By the way, it's definitely worth booking a Vatican tour in advance as we did - either through the hotel or on the internet. You'll still end up in a queue of other tour parties, but only for 30 mins at most - if you turn up on your own, bank on at least a couple of hours........ Breakfast was basic, but sufficient and it was very pleasant to have the roof terrace - even though I must disagree with previous postings about the view - it's not that great..Salvatore mixes some excellent cocktails and loves it if you attempt some Italian, so give it a go with your phrase book.

The breakfast could be taken in the dining room or on the rooftop terrace which gives fantastic views across the city and there was plenty to choose from.

S Susanne, Pza Barberini, Quirinale, Trevi, Pantheon and Pza Navona with a a stop for dinner near the Pantheon. A good easy afternoon/evening stroll. About 5/10 mins from Republica it's a steady walk to the Metro for Vatican / Popolo one way and Colosseum the other so easy to get around using public transport if not keen on taking the bus. Admittedly it is quiet in and around the hotel - ideal for couples wanting a city break close enough to access the city but not in the hustle and bustle.

We had a lovely time at Marcella Royal and would recommend the hotel (and citry). Personally I would have added another night to cover a little more (tackling Vatican Museums, St Peters and Castel St Angelo in one day is virtually impossible given the queues whilst a good full day is needed in Colosseum, Palatine and Forum).

We certainly appreciated being able to eat at the hotel after a long day of sight-seeing. Staff are efficient and friendly. They booked a sight-seeing tour for us, giving us advice about it, and organised a car to the airport for us too. Their local knowledge was much appreciated. This hotel was perfect for us.

On 2 evenings we ate in the rooftop restaurant, which although it didn't offer a large menu, was very good and excellent value for money. The hotel itself is situated in the north east of the city, near the British, American and Japanese Embassays. One can take a bus, less than 3 mins walk to the cities attractions. For the more energetic, the Spanish Steps are only 1 mile away which would take approx 15 mins to walk through a very nice area.

It's in a good location near the train station. The rooms, while small, are comfortable and the price is fair. The roof bar and restaurant are real draws, with good views of the whole city (including Saint Peter's dome) and the surrounding hills. While there is not a lot of activity near the hotel, the street has several good places on it. Sadly, they did not recommend the better places to us, which brings me to the first of several problems. When a hotel recommends something to me, I expect something more than just the place that gives the hotel a kickback....I want something objective. They recommended a place called Taverna Flavia, which was a real disappointment (second worst dining experience of a 16 day trip). This restaurant (you'll know it by all the moviestar photos on the wall) was expensive, poor service, poor wine and really mediocre food. A very bad experience, despite (as other reviewers have pointed out) other good places nearby. Why they recommend such a poor quality place begs speculation about objectivity and means that you won't want to trust their recommendations. The second problem that we had was that we got there is generally cool weather, but one day it was warm and humid. We couldn't get the air conditioning to work (it was promised to us at booking) and when we called the front desk, we were informed that they only run it during parts of the year. If you get an A/C day when they don't want to run it, then your stuck, despite the aminity being listed as available at the time of booking. Bottom line, you might want to consider them as being A/C-less. Problem #3: We had an 8AM flight, we absolutely needed to be up by 5:45 to get it (ya, that's cutting it close, but ...), so we got a wake up call .... but they never made it. Fortunately, the blackberry backup worked but, failing to make a wake up call can lead to serious problems for the guests. If you can live with these problems, then it's more of a 4 level place.

Immediately we were dazzled. This small hotel tucked down a quiet sidestreet in an upscale business district was first class. Allessandro at the front desk greeted us with warmth and friendliness--and was helpful and attentive in our lost luggage escapade. Although it was 4 hours before check-in time--he graciously insisted we head to our room to nap and relax while he looked into the luggage situation. ALthough no luck on luggage--his charm and kindness had already transformed what seemed like the start of a rough trip into something very special. Rome was delightful--again thanks to the map and directions, plus shopping and restaruant selections Allessandro and the staff provided. The location of the hotel was perfect--out of the way of tourists--but providing a nice, safe long walk to any of the historic sites (except the Vatican by bus). We found the restaurants along the hotel's street Via Flavia to be the very best in Rome. The rooftop terrace is perfect for a final glass of wine for the evening--although the \"piano bar\" was actually an electric keyboard with a handsome karoke-sounding Italian man doing covers of lite-rock hits. The rooftop breakfast was the best in Italy--complete with eggs, bacon, breads, fruits, cheeses, meats, yogurt--and everything including very aggressive pigeons. While our room was small--it was immmaculate and beautifully appointed with silk linens, nice bathroom etc. We liked the Marcella so much we booked this hotel on our way back through Rome--and for the same price Allessandro surprised us with a HUGE corner room with a balcony, kingbed etc. All in all--this hotel is absolutely a perfect way to experience the charm of an incredible city. The staff is classy, dependable, and kind. While we will always treasure our dream trip to Italy--and it truly was made a wonderful experience in large part to the unforgettable Marcella Royal.

Although quite small, the rooms were extremely clean, decorated in an old Italian style (fancy fabric wallpaper, lighting etc). The chambermaid kept our room immaculate, not easy when you are sharing with a 13 year old! All the staff were polite, efficient and friendly - again, far better than other hotels in Italy. It really does make a difference. The free internet access on the sixth floor was a boon for our son as were the sky sports channels where he was actually able to watch his team (Liverpool) play Sunderland. The only difficulty was prising him out of the hotel! The roof terrace was lovely - in the evening for a drink, in the morning for breakfast, or to sunbathe on the loungers provided. We did this one afternoon after sightseeing and were totally oblivious to the fact that there was an earthquake ( 4.5 on the richter scale) going on below us! The breakfast was lovely, hot water perfectly hot for tea, fresh rolls, meat, cheeses and delicious filled croissants. We did have a meal on our first night on the roof terrace which we found very disappointing for the price - I would definitely recommend eating out. One place we did try - and loved - was the Hard Rock Cafe on the Via Veneto. Excellent food and atomesphere at a great price - ok, so it's not traditional Italian fayre but our son loved it. Try the starter combo!! I agree with previous comments about the prices in Rome - we knew it would be expensive having been before, but on one occasion sheltering in a bar from the rain were stung with a 20 euro bill for 2 beers, a coke and an iced tea. Our main gripe though was the cost of the taxi back to Ciampino airport - we were quoted 50 to 55 euros by hotel reception who booked it for us. A 40 minute journey took 25 minutes due to the manic driving of our taxi driver who managed to steer and operate two mobiles at the same time. When we got there he told us it was 65 euros. After a bit of arguing I paid up, however please be warned. Also be careful of pickpockets - we met a lovely swedish couple who were out buying postcards on their final day to show where they had visited, as the previous night their camera had been stolen while at the Spanish Steps, complete with all their holiday snaps. The hotel is a bit of a walk to the main attractions but we did manage to get transport - the 62 bus to the Vatican and the metro, but if you are not fit you will find it a trek.

If I get the downsides out of the way first, it will be easier. The only things I could possibly complain about are: 1) it is quite a long walk to many of the sights. But I knew that. Rome is a big city and wherever you stay you have to travel about. There are bus stops close by that take you pretty much anywhere for \u20ac1 - as we discovered travelling back from the Olympic stadium after the U2 concert! Plus it's fun exploring, so this really isn't a complaint as far as we were concerned and the walk home is good for you after pizza and pasta! 2) there were no bread rolls on sunday morning, only cut bread. Hardly worth complaining about though eh? So that's it on the downside, what about the good things. Well, we flew into Ciampino and got the bus into town, dropping us off at the Termini station. Ten minute walk to the hotel. Not the most inspiring of facades, but pleasant enough. Inside it was pukka - and the aircon was very welcome. Friendly, helpful and courteous staff. Easy check in and straight to the room. We were on the 4th floor and the room was lovely. Huge bed, pristine bathroom, funky wall 'paper' and everything very clean. Again the aircon was brilliant given the mid 30c temperatures outside. We then headed up to the piano bar. This made the place for us. How nice to sit on the roof, sipping cold drinks looking out over Rome. Ok, so some of the view consists of roofs and aerials, but you can see St Peters, the hills and a lot of the city. Breakfast is served from 7 -10 am and we ate outside each morning which was lovely. It felt like being on a beach holiday in some ways - that may sound strange but was how we felt. So much nicer than being cooped up inside eating breakfast. We asked for a late check out on the last day and this was no problem at all. Again the staff were really helpful and smiled all the time - it is so simple yet makes all the difference. I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Rome.

Also being a little further out the restaurants are a little cheaper and it is quieter at night. We were there when the new Pope was voted in and so Rome was packed.
