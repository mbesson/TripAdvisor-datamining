We had booked a full harbour view room (turned out to be on 20st floor), it offered indeed a stunning view of the harbour, Opera House and Harbour Bridge. However other room types will offer a less attractive view (or none at all), but are still quite expensive. Having arrived at the hotel at 9AM, our room wasn't ready yet. Unfortunate, yet we understand that that may happen with an early morning arrival. But despite us coming in straight from a 9 hours night flight, the desk staff disappointingly made no effort to try limit our inconvenience: \"please come back in 2 hours\". Once ready, our room was very nice, spacious and comfortably providing all necessary amenities. Next day, we found continental breakfast offering limited choice and being poorly restocked once items ran out. Absolute negative experience was internet/wifi access: charging AU$25 for a day basic access is a rip-off. A hotel of this class should offer free service.

Room review: A bit on the small size for the price you are paying, but this is an expensive city, so it was difficult to get a hotel offering bed & breakfast, which the Four Seasons did. LOVELY comfortable big bed, had fantastic sleep. Windows did not open. REALLY BAD internet connection. By bad, i mean terrible! It took 2 hours to download 1 song from iTunes. In 2012, i really think Hotels need to get High Speed internet sorted. Cleaning staff were fantastic, really cleaned the room well & tidied up our stuff imaculately. Breakfast review: Was \"good\" but not excellent. I just felt something was lacking. When i have stayed at other 5 star hotels, you get a much better international selection of foods, which were not represented here so well. Staff Review: No complaints. Really helpful. Well done! Spa Review: Way too expensive. Restaurant tips: We had some of the best food of our international trip in Sydney. You Must try two places: Sake (Japanese + Mexican Influences) around the corner from the hotel. Amazing! but a bit pricey. Great ambience. Make sure you book! Also, North Bondi Italian (in Bondi Beach). WOW: The best Pasta i have had in 10 years. And i am fussy! Perfect al dente Rigatoni with Italian Sausage.

We thought the hotel was great, very old style luxury such as: - pianist at breakfast - very relaxing - soaps that smelled nice (my wife loved them) - bed turn down service (not expected, but when we came back late from dinner, the rooms were set ready for us to relax) All the staff were really friendly, and really played to up for the kids.

I'm a sofitel fan and in manynways, the four seasons feels like a bigger if slightly more dated version of the same thing. To start, the location is arguably amongst the best in the city centre. Rooms appear to either have great city or, in my case, harbor views. And whether short term tourist or business traveller, it's hard to think of a more convenient city centre spot -ferries, harbour, opera house, the rocks, botanic gardens, all within moments. The entrance is big and impressive and service from the doorman to check in to room service staff is pretty slick. My room wasn't massive and the presence of a pretty large (and exceedingly comfortable) bed, together with chunky desk, sideboard and lounge chair didn't leave a massive amount of floor space. That said, better to have less room and quality fittings than a massive space without a great feel to it. Bathroom was nice enough... Separate bath and shower, something I'm a big fan of personally. Little touches like the very nice toiletries help reinforce a feeling of value for the dollars you're paying. And finishing on that note, my room was 220 or so. I'm not sure of the typical rates, by for that price, it's pretty good value for money.

Unfortunately on this occasion, that was not the case. We left with the impression that the Sydney Four Seasons isn't quite up to scratch and though we experienced true Four Seasons service eventually, for the first 22 of the 24 hours or so we were there, it was more Holiday Inn standard. To begin with, our room wasn't ready. OK, that's hardly unusual in a busy city centre hotel, but even when we returned at 3pm, there was still a delay. Fortunately, we'd not flown in from some far flung destination, but nevertheless, it was irritating to not be able to change or freshen up. Far more importantly, it was impossible to access items such as sunscreen and suchlike from our checked in baggage which we'd left at the hotel when we arrived mid morning. Our \"day in Sydney\" turned out to be a day feeling a little on the wrong foot but even so, we decided that we'd move on and not allow it to spoil our precious time here. Our room, when we got there was incredibly small. For sure, there was the Opera House outside the window - beautiful - but actually, there was hardly room to move around without tripping over bags or each other. But we were meeting friends for dinner and not going to spend much time there and hey, we're in the Four Seasons, Sydney - what's not to like?! Arriving back from dinner, let's simply say we experienced a problem with our room. Without going into too many details, the unimpressive service was eventually resolved to our satisfaction. But when staying for such a short time, any such incident casts a pall over the whole experience and sadly, we'd be reluctant to recommend the hotel as a result. However, location is everything and when choosing to stay here, I'd suggest you question your priorities. If it's important to stay at The Four Seasons wherever you go, then of course, go ahead. If you'd like to be right there on Circular Quay, mere steps away from the action, then it's a must. Yes, go ahead. But if you're looking to be pampered, to have a spacious room with all the usual trappings, with the service which usually comes at such places, then perhaps it's worth casting the net a little further. So how come I've rated it four stars? Well, it is a Four Seasons after all, the beds are incredibly comfortable and the location lifts it right up there.

This hotel is within a block or two of all of those areas. You can't beat the location of this hotel. I stayed in Room 3402, an Executive One Bedroom Suite on the very top floor of the hotel. Unfortunately, the word \"Executive\" is misleading because it does not give you access to the Executive Club on the 32nd floor (that is an additional $135/pp double per day). Rather than \"Executive One Bedroom Suite\" they should just call it a \"One Bedroom Suite\" so as not to confuse their guests. The other negative was that the counter space in the bathroom was very narrow and there wasn't a place to put things out of the way. I like to have my toiletries out where I can easily access them. There simply wasn't room. The positives - the shower was quite large, the bed was very comfortable, the living room area was quite spacious with a generous-sized desk (great for 2 people with laptops), the room came with robes and slippers, and the housekeeping service was wonderful. A couple of nice perks - bottled water by the entrance of the hotel every morning, a self-service latte machine in the bar of the lobby that actually makes great lattes, cappucinos, espresso, etc with to-go cups right there at no charge. Great for when you're on the go (however, there is a Starbucks across the street). I was disappointed that after traveling for over 24 hours and arriving in the morning, we were not afforded early check-in even though we had requested it.

I chose the Four Seasons due to the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and personal recommendations about how great the hotel is. Unfortunately, this was not our experience, and I very much regret not staying at the Westin or Sheraton on the Park, where we have previously stayed and were very happy. We thought Four Seasons would be even better. The foyer itself needs a complete revamp. It looks tired and if not for the fabulous flower arrangements and back wall of reception desk, would look like a very average hotel. The design reminds me of the very tired Marriott up the road. We stayed in the city-harbourview room and had a nice view of the opera house. (complimentary upgrade from hoteltravel.com). The bed, is amazing, and is as good as the Westin Heavenly bed. The doorman, Pasquale, is amazing. He always remembered our names and cheerfully greeted us and was very helpful. He is a credit to the Four Seasons reputation. The hotel also services your room twice a day, which is lovely. The housekeepers do a seriously great job. The room itself looks rather dated, the bed head had scratches and marks all over it but I try not to complain about little things when we're on holiday. Loved the L'Occitane toiletries and robes, which were just the right thickness. However, two room service incidents ruined our stay. What we noticed about this Four Seasons is that housekeeping literally barge into your room. You will hear someone clicking their card against the door, a doorbell, and then OPEN. This happened to us a couple of times and we found ourselves having to race to the door. As a result, I rang up housekeeping and asked them to service our room at 7pm that night... imagine our dismay when we found them in our room at 4.18pm when we returned from a quick trip to the convenience store... so there we were, waiting in the foyer for a good 15-20 minutes. Even after mentioning this to reception, you would think they would offer something to compensate us for the inconvenience... a drink at the bar? Nah... we were left waiting. Fabulous service, Four Seasons! That night, the receptionist assured me this would not happen again and our room would be cleaned the next day after 12pm as per my specifications. Guess what? They came in at 10am... Strike two! Well, I was angry. When I couldn't reach housekeeping director, I left a message for the hotel manager. To her credit, the housekeeping director did her best to rectify the situation, as we were seriously thinking about leaving to stay at another hotel for the last two nights. She personally looked after us, and did a good job. The hotel manager, however, did not bother returning my call. Now I don't care that the housekeeping director told him what was going on, and they were working on the issue. If a customer leaves a message for you, you ring them back, even to acknowledge that another executive staff member has addressed the issue. You don't blatantly ignore the message. Makes me feel like because we weren't staying in a high end suite on the 34th floor, we weren't important enough to be acknowledged by the hotel manager. I will be writing to the higher powers of Four Seasons about this hotel manager. On our last night at the hotel, another glitch occurs. This was the only night I had time to use the steam rooms. The hotel book says the spa is open until 9.30pm. I headed down at 8.55pm. The spa receptionist told me they were closed. Apparently from the beginning of 2012, the spa now closes at 9.00pm instead of 9.30pm. And steam rooms close at 8.45pm. Wow....after all the troubles we've already had with this hotel, this was the last straw. Duty manager speaks to me.. acknowledges the hotel room information book needs to be changed.. and that was it. Never mind that you've inconvenienced the customer, one who stayed not one or two but 5 nights with you. It was a relief to move on from the Four Seasons Sydney. We will return to the Westin or Sheraton on the Park next time. Maybe try Intercontinental (we like the Rocks area). But there is a twist to this story. What the hotel doesn't know, is that I was testing it out as a possible destination for a work conference for 80-100 people. That's why they should treat every customer with 100% fabulous service, even if they stayed in a \"cheap room\".", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Medic_5", "ReviewID": "UR124677186", "Content": "We spent three nights at the Four Seasons before our cruise.

The bed was great, the bathroom immaculate, and the TV had enough channels so that I didn't mind hanging out in the room on one of the rainy days we had in Sydney. The service was A-1 from the front desk, to house keeping, to the concierge. My two niggles were minor but I think in need of response: 1. The price charged for wifi bordered on extortion. Not only did they have the nerve to charge more than $20 a day for internet they had to the gaul to give you the option to pay for one internet option that allowed one the ability to watch video or another that offered limited bandwith. Give me a break! The other 3, 4, and 5 star hotels in Sydney don't do this why would the Four Seasons resort to such shenanigans for the sake of a buck. Trust me your clients know when they are being nickel and dimed and this is absolutely shameless. 2. How is there nobody at the pool to service the guests? There was just a sign on a phone that asked guests to call in their food and drink orders. So every time I wanted a drink I had to get out of the pool and run over to the phone like a hobo and beg room service for a drink?

This hotel reminded me of what hotel service used to be. A proper driveway horseshoe you can drive into. A well dressed man snaps into action to guide you to a sensible spot. They casually great you and offer assistance. There is no rushing to grab your key and disappear with your car or opening the boot before the cars even stopped or fighting the taxis for position (they're kept well away until needed). The huge reception area was always stocked with staff meaning we never once waited to be served and were always greeted in a relaxed and friendly manner. It was a almost a shame because it was such a beautiful and spacious foyer I could have admired it for longer. Check in was hassle free and we headed up to the room.

We had to call room service several times overnight for more cot sheets (our little boy was ill unfortunately) and they were brought to us very quickly. Isaac (think he was the Garage Manager) was especially lovely, spending ages finding us a taxi with a car seat to get to the medical centre and then making a point of coming over to us when we returned to find out how our little boy was. Made us feel very looked after. On a practical level, we got the train from the airport to Circular Quay for about $15 each one way. The train is very easy to find from the Domestic Terminal and takes about 18 mins to Circular Quay. The hotel is about 5 mins easy walk from the station, carrying luggage. Wi-fi is $25 a day which we thought was a bit much given the price for the rooms and we didn't eat anywhere at the hotel as that was pricey too and there are plenty of places nearby which are great, especially in the Rocks which is a couple of minutes walk. You are obviously also right next to where the ferries leave for Manly, Taronga Zoo and other attractions and a very short walk to the Botanic Gardens. We were on the 28th floor with a 'city' view but ended up being on a corner so got half city and half harbour which was lovely. It was nice and quiet, apart from our poorly child! Rooms are kitted out as you'd expect for a hotel at that price - mini bar, iron, safe, lovely toiletries and super comfy bed etc. They have a turn down service where they also fill your ice bucket which is a nice touch. Thinking back, the one thing that wasn't as you'd expect was the tv quality - high def tvs with absolutely dreadful reception. I guess people don't tend to watch much tv when they stay there.

Once I had decided on the Four Seasons I remember being confused about which room to go in for. The FULL HARBOUR view rooms are naturally more expensive and the question I had was - is that really worth it????? - Well, the answer is a big YES because if the view of the harbour and in particular the Sydney opera is important then YES. A beautiful GRANDIOSE view of the opera and harbour bridge and the whole area, awaits you and it is totally unobstructed. One of the gentleman in his review insisted on underlining this and I am glad I took up his suggestion so please go in for the FULL harbour view. We were on floor 32 and the higher you are the better. Anything above 20 should be ok I think. Hotel staff were polite and helpful and everything was upto standard. One very pleasant and unexpected surprise was the SHEER SIZE of the room. We were three and the bed was king size - the room was king size and the view certainly was kingsize. The location is very very good and you can't be better placed. - The hotel is also most suitable in its location because the ferry to go to the Sydney zoo in just across the road as is the port if you are boarding a cruise liner. Sydney Opera is just a two minute walk - there is no hotel closer or better placed that the Four Seasons on George Street. It is the first in line so you can't go wrong with this one. Also 12 dollars and a taxi will take you to most sites. iF you have kids go to see the dinosaurs in the Museum of Australia. The point for improvement for the 4 seasons would be the poolside area. There could have been a lot more flowers and colour considering it was summer and the poolside entrance and the pool in general is a bit viellot and seems dated. Could be so much better - more summer vegetation should be present to make you forget the noise of the city - although it remains today reasonable.

After studying the hotel's website and realizing what our agent had done, I called the hotel directly and they were delightful to deal with. They actually moved us up a few levels to a Premier Harbor View Room - a huge corner room - #1615, with views of the Harbor Bridge and the Opera House, at a lesser rate than advertised. It was reasonable for what we got. Best room, hotel, and breakfast of our entire stay in Australia. Hotel staff was phenomenal; concierge perfect. Just happy I made the change from what Travcoa, so-called \"Leader in World Luxury Travel\" had booked for us.

Sydney is a beautiful city and with the tourist action centered around the harbor, the hotel's location right in The Rocks and by Circular Quay is fantastic.

In our first \"harbor view\" room, you could see the opera house if you squished yourself against the right side of the glass, but nothing from the chairs or the bed. Since we requested a room where you could actually see the harbor, we asked to switch rooms and this was accommodated within a matter of hours. The staff was also very accommodating to our unusual request to have a toaster in our room for a fun brunch of homemade treats and gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate with.

Hotel rates are eye wateringly high in Sydney over this period, in our case AUS$800 a night but given it was for a once in a lifetime experience we thought why not.... On checking in we were given the key to what can only be described as a 'pokey' room - so small it didn't even have a normal door to the bathroom, just a noisy sliding one. It did technically have the Opera House view - if you stood directly in front of the window to the far right - hardly a useable view as only one person could stand there at a time. Overall the room felt dated and in need of a refurbishment and most definably was not what we expected for the money. My husband spoke to one of the duty managers who said she would see what she could do to move us the following day. Unfortunately a shocking night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep was had as there was a fault with the air conditioning and it kept me awake most of the night. On returning to reception the next morning my husband was told there was an upgrade available \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for an additional AUS$300 A NIGHT!!! A completely unacceptable situation then occurred when they started to negotiate the room upgrade cost. It was only when we asked to check out early that the matter was referred to someone senior in the management team who arrange to move us free of charge. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not named the assistant manager my husband spoke to as I do not think it is fair to do so \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however she really has a lot to learn in the art of managing disappointed customers. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room was a much better size and did have the most fabulous full harbour view, the type and size of room expected from the Four Seasons brand, but it was a case of too little too late. Even at the normal rate of AUS$400 the first room was overpriced and disappointing. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve really struggled to rate this hotel as I do not want to be overly harsh and the location is terrific, but in terms of value for money and staff attitude (when we were checking out I overheard the same upgrade negotiation cost for another customer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if there are better rooms empty why not use them to wow customers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll tell others which in turn will be good for future bookings....!!) it is not the best. This hotel was supposed to be the highlight of our 3 week holiday in Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sadly it was not, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve given The Louise in the Barossa Valley, Sebel Playford in Adelaide and Quay West Suites in Melbourne all \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexcellent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reviews, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend these hotels to family and friends.

It was right in the heart of Sydney in The Rocks district, in walking distance, close to everything! That's basically what you are paying for-the location! In my case, we also paid for the ocean view, which was a nice treat! As for the hotel itself, I've stayed at The Ritz Carlton(once), Marriott, HIlton, Hyatt, etc. and I would put this hotel in the same category as a Marriott. The room and the bathroom were small and we had a room with a king sized bed. The maid service kept it clean and had a turn down service at night, but most nights we were already sleeping by the time they wanted to come in. The room also had a desk/chair, small ottoman, and flat screen TV. There were bathrobes in the room for us to use during our stay, but we had to ask for complimentary slippers(which were plain, not displaying the name of the hotel). The Ritz provides you with slippers(that actually display the hotel's name) and robes! The hotel was pretty quiet, so once we closed the door to our room, we weren't disturbed. The overall look of the hotel gave me the feel of a business type hotel. The decor used used dark woods and earth tone colors. It wasn't bright and inviting. We were told by the front desk that it had been renovated about 4 times since it was built with the last time being a few years ago. The best thing we can say about the hotel is that the breakfast was delicious! They had a wide variety of food that represented diverse cultures. The breakfast staff was warm and friendly and we really enjoyed their attentiveness! The concierge was quite helpful and knowledgeable, so we checked with them every morning, since we were touring independently. The front desk staff were also very pleasant! Make sure to use the complimentary safety deposit boxes! The only other hotel in that area with a better view would be the Shangri-La Hotel. The view of all the others are blocked by tall buildings, so this was the best bet, since Shangri-La was so expensive. My pet peeve was that there wasn't free wi-fi!

An hour later, I went to find out what was going on with the room and was told it was being worked on. 30 minutes after that, we were taken to our room. We had a request for a king room, facing Sydney Harbor. We walked into the room and it had a king size bed and not much else because there was no room for anything else. The room was the size of a 3 star room in Europe, not what we expected in the Four Seasons. The bathroom was the size of a broom closet with a small, stall shower. I called the front desk to complain and was told there was nothing that could be done unless I paid $150.00 a night extra. After 2 days of misery, I called and demanded to speak to the manager. I voiced our displeasure and asked if they had another room, not facing the Harbor on another floor that was bigger that we could switch to. He found us a great room facing the city at no additional charge. Requesting a king room at this hotel does not guarantee that you will get a decent sized room. Make sure you see pictures or request a suite. Sydney is an expensive city but the restaurants in this hotel are really high and there are better restaurants to eat at.

The lunch tables by the pool also had to be reserved at a time as it was so busy which really is ridiculous as when you sit by the pool it is meant to be relaxing.

We had been hoping to book into the Hyatt until we realised it was undergoing major Reno but we were not disappointed at all with having to change our plans. The biggest factor for the four seasons is probably it's location, it is right beside circular quay and the rocks, minutes from Pitt St, the main shopping area and basically close to everything you could want in a city and if you are not well you have taxis, ferries and trains at your finger tips. The lobby was nicely laid out and of course the big Christmas tree! Check in went smoothly and as we arrived early, they took our bags and we went to have lunch. The rooms are of a very high cleanliness standard, we had room 1501 which was city view, looking out onto the street obviously, the shower grout could do ith some refreshing as it was a bit mildewy but I am being picky on this as there was nothing else to fault. very Comfy bed, though both I am my husband found the pillows to high/hard. I had some beautiful treatments at the spa, facial, body brush and hot stone massage, it came as a signature package and reasonably priced, spa is lovely and very professional staff, elegant spa lobby and lovely staff. My husband used both gym and pool and thought both were excellent. We did not eat in the hotel as we were meeting friends throughout the weekend so cannot comment on food/service. Though coffee in the lobby was great. Internet connection is $25 per 24hr and car parking is $55 per day. The rooms are not massive, rather average sized really, and I hoped for a bit of a wow factor if not with the room than perhaps with the view, but it was comfortable, very clean and in a fantastic location. I did have to go to the spa on the 3rd floor in the dressing gown provided in the room, but slippers were not provided though I was given them at the spa to use, it would have been better to have these in the room or have them sent to the room with the gentle reminder received from the spa the night before the treatments.

Ok, well, with my derriere that may cause a few issues such as diamond cushioning along my skin making my butt resemble the surface of a buttoned leather lounge. The Four Seasons Sydney reminds me of this saying. Not because I was forced to sit and sleep on milk crates or anything substandard; quite the contrary. The furnishings are just lovely with a hint of regality but are obviously well worn. The king size bed felt like it had a 30cm feather pillow top on it which was UH-MAZ-ING to fall into at the end of the day. Heavy cotton curtains in each room if drawn would make you think that 8:30am is actually 2am as I found out and it wasn't a welcomed surprise however I can appreciate the idea if I was nursing a hangover. What I loved about the Four Seasons were the people and the personal service that they provided. They were kind, courteous and generally interested to hear about my stay with them. It felt like coming home where family were asking you how your travels were and if you'd like a night cap. Mind you, a night cap at my mother's house certainly wouldn't be $16 a glass but then again, I wouldn't be served a 2006 Shiraz from the Hunter Valley at mum's house. Maybe just a cup of tea and a kick up the bum. Yes, the Four Seasons is pricey. And why wouldn't it be? It's at The Rock's in Sydney, one of the most affluent areas in Australia. The real estate that this hotel is built on would be worth a mint and possibly even more if a Chinese company could get their hands on it given their buying capability in Australia at present. Buffet breakfast is a lazy $42 per head which includes all of the bells and whistles you'd expect but I honestly thought that the spread would be a touch better given that I've eaten at The Grand Hyatt in Melbourne of which I compare the Seasons to in price and also reputation. Streaky Australian bacon just doesn't cut it for the only meat option on the menu. I can pay $8 for a streaky bacon and egg sandwich at any of the little cafes you'd find in a side street. Am I being fussy for $42? Damn straight I'm being fussy! I would like Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, the eggs poached hard with none of that vinegar flavour and freshly made Hollandaise. Oh, and toasted panini bread. In the Seasons favour, they served fresh orange juice plus any barista made coffee you'd like. Only problem was, where was the barista? The latte came out cold and weak. Hm, see what I mean? Again, all I can say about the Four Seasons is that the people make this hotel. If it weren't for their courtesy and subservient attitude, I would say that the Seasons needed a serious decorating renovation to bring the standard up to the prices that they ask. Oh, and Matt Preston to get in there and do a serious breakfast review because it is just not good enough! Would I stay here again? Sure! Only if my employer footed the bill.

This hotel is excellent for a number of reasons. First, the room was comfortable and well furnished. Ours had and many of the rooms have a view of the harbour and the Circular Quay. Its nearness to the Quay makes it a fine place to be for ferry trips on the harbour and all other forms of transport, bus and train. It is also near to the Rocks and in a less busy area than in the city itself. The bed in our room was one of the most comfortable i have ever slept in in the many cities we have visited around the world. This is particularly important for a long stay of 13 nights. Long enough to feel at home. The staff are very professional and friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. When one of our sons pyjamas disappeared they searched for a couple of days and then gave us some money to buy another pair. There was no quibble about this. Their attitude was great. Also they were quick to extend a conference rate I had for the first 4 nights to the whole of our stay. A better rate than available in any other nearby hotel. Overall an excellent experience. My only negative point, is that it was a surprise to find, when i got home to the UK, a credit card service charge on the bill for MasterCard which I had not noticed.

The pool and hot tub were very nice, the perfect spot to relax in the sunshine, comfy loungers and fluffy towels in abundance.

Our suite was always spotless, the maids did an outstanding job, and the bathroom always well stocked with fresh towels - loved the pressure in the shower - it was energising and refreshing. The beds are much lauded at this hotel, but to be honest, I found it totally uncomfortable! The whole week I felt like I was sleeping in a valley or on an inclined plane! Time to buy new mattresses I think. The furniture was beginning to look a little tired, and the couch had a definite odour about it, it was also as hard as a rock, so I avoided sitting there. No satelite TV, just a few channels to choose from, a RS menu that had the most outrageous prices I have ever seen - $16 for a glass of wine. No free Internet. We were shocked that they wanted an extra $25 a day for WiFi. A hotel of this calibre should have free internet. Check in was a bit of a strike out, our room wasn't not ready, ( The front Desk gals did however arrange a nice table in the bar with some hot tea for us while we waited. That was a nice gesture) We were informed that breakfast was not included in our rate, and that was an additional $40 per person per day, I enquired about the complimentary morning tea and muffins (as advertised on the web site) and they informed us we could upgrade to include morning muffins and nightly canapes for $185 a day, this is when we were also told of the internet charges, it was just bad news being delivered all round. When you consider that the rack rate for our suite was already about $500 a night - we certainly were not in the mood to hear about all the extra charges the hotel had in store for us, especially after a 15 hour flight.

Firstly, it is truly a 5 star hotel. Service was impeccable, the Front Desk cordial and welcoming, the Concierge above-and-beyond helpful. When they say they will call back with an answer to a question (if they don't have it right away) then they do so in a very timely fashion. Beautiful common areas, great room service, attentive staff. Secondly, the rooms were in spectacular condition, and our particular room had the perfect view of both the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. My wife was feeling ill, and we spent an entire day inside the room, and I can't imagine a better hotel room to be in. The location is superb. We stayed in the hotel for 3 days, and we NEVER ONCE took a cab to go anywhere. There is so much within walking distance from this hotel: the harbor, the opera house, the botanical gardens, the Rocks, pubs, restaurants, convenience stores, the zoo, etc. If you want to stay in Sydney in a place to be able to see the major sights, and feel like even when you're just inside your room that you are deep in the heart of Sydney, then get an Opera House or Harbour view room at the Four Seasons. As far as value, sure it's expensive, but as with many of the Four Season properties, you get what you pay for.

The hotel was very comfortable and had a highly convenient location within minutes walk of both Circular Quay and George Street shopping area. Although our room was somewhat compact, we had a partial view of Sydney Opera House. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fine with a good shower. We used the concierge service to book a meal in the Sydney Tower on our first night and the girl was friendly and efficient. The hotel is ideal for walking around the Circular Quay and Rocks area; we walked down to the left to get to Sydney Opera House. There we had an excellent and enlightening tour with Alan, full of enthusiasm for this iconic building. We also took a Majestic lunchtime harbour cruise. This afforded some terrific views of one of the most photogenic cities, and the buffet lunch was delicious. We walked back to the Four Seasons from Darling Harbour; the latter area well worth a visit. We enjoyed a couple of drinks in the lobby bar of the Four Seasons and we found the staff friendly and efficient. We also took a ferry from Circular Quay over to Taronga Zoo; which was very enjoyable. The only negative in relation to the Four Seasons was that we were a little disappointed with the buffet breakfast as it didn't have as much variety on offer as other Australian hotels we had stayed in on our trip and did not have a cook station for omelettes etc. Overall however I would recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay here if we are ever \"down under\" in Sydney again.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but worth it...\u201d", "Author": "OldAdelaide", "ReviewID": "UR117691677", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel twice in the past 2weeks and on both occasions the staff and service were fantastic.

We arrived early (around 8am) from our flight from London so our rooms were not ready. We were sent to the restaurant for complimentary drinks whilst we waited and the receptionist took our cell phone number to call us when the rooms were available. We left our luggage with bell services so that we could have a walk outside. At 9:15 we were called to say that both rooms were ready so we went back to check in. Our luggage was in our rooms when we got there. We had booked harbour views and were not dissapointed with what we could see, a perfect view of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. The room was well appointed and looked clean and well kept. Breakfast at the hotel was excellent (we had this included in our room price, if paying seperately I thought it quite expensive however it was in keeping with breakfast prices in other Australian city hotels.) Service was always quick and the servers very polite. The hot breakfast buffet was good, especially having 2 types of bacon. The cold buffet options were also excellent especially the selection of fruit and variety of smoothies. The pastery and smoothie selections changed daily so there was a variety throughout the stay. A big plus for this hotel is its location. Being on the very edge of Circular Quay was excellent as you did not have a walk up the hill or steep steps after getting off the ferry (something we had to do when we stayed at the Shangri-la a week later, even though on a map and in pictures the hotels look like they are on the same level.) Being in this location also meant that you could get to the station and main bus stops within a few minutes walk. There were only a few negatives about this hotel. The bedroom windows, they allowed a lot of noise into the room from the road and railway which ran close to the hotel. Whilst this did not bother me it did bother others in my family a little. Also for a hotel of this class and the amount charged for the room free internet access would be a plus (this was offered in other 5 star hotels that we stayed in on this trip.)

Convenient location to go and visit the Opera house, royal botanic gardens and the old rock. It is a large hotel with more than 400 rooms which is not ordinary for this brand. On arrival, we were greeted by doorman and escorted to front desk area. There was a long queue and we had to wait for a long time to be served. I think they had number of tour groups checking in at that time. They should have arranged seperate check-in area or desk. It is really disappointing that they make independant travellers waiting, who must be paying more than $500 per night. Check-in agents seemed more interesting in upselling or persusading guests to pay more for upgraded room type rather than deeply apologizing and thanking for patience. We stayed in a harbour view room. Absolutely amazing view from the room, different experience from Park Hyatt Sydney. We do recommend you to request higher floor well in advance. This is really worth it. Room size is very small compared to any other Four Seasons hotel or 5 star hotels in Sydney such as Westin, Park Hyatt and InterContinental Sydney. I liked the layout of room furnitures but bathrooms really needs some refresh. Overall, we were happy with the room until we found couple of cochroaches in the bathtub. My partner almost screamed. I called the guest service to report this matter and a guy came to our room after 15 minutes smiling which we think he did not understand how serious this was. We requested an another room to move and front desk agent told us that the only available was opera view room which is downgraded room type. We did not accept it and they offered harbour view suite with upgrade fee of only $100 per night. We wanted to talk to the manager on duty but again we had to wait for a long time. I think it was just nightmare on that day as there was still long queue when we came down to front desk to complain about this whole cochroach issue. Not sure if this is normal day for this hotel. Then, Four Seasons as a brand really should consider not to extend the management contract as this is ruining the whole brand and it seems that as a guest you could never expect consistent Four Seasons branded experience. Anyway, we ended up staying in city view suite for one night without any additional cost but we moved to InterContinental Sydney next day which was far better than Four Seasons Sydney in many ways including check-in and out experience, manner and staff attitude of front desk agents. We had pleasant conversation with front desk agent at the InterContinental Sydney who was more interested in our trip and dinner plan...

Here is what I liked based on my three-night stay. --Service was superb. Check-in was welcoming; the person who checked me in even took time to step away from the desk and give me a brief tour of the hotel's lobby. Although there were lines at check-out, they moved quickly, and the desk was fully staffed. Every staff member I encountered on an elevator, in the lobby, etc. stopped to say hello and engaged me in conversation (but not too much conversation) about my visit to Sydney. Detail-orientation was impressive -- for example, I started a bag of laundry in my room using one of the Four Seasons bags (which are fabric, nice touch) and at turndown service a note had been placed on my bag saying that it was assumed it was personal laundry, but that if it was dry cleaning that should be picked up, I could fill out the form and call them. A city map was in the room materials, as was a map with suggested running routes. At every turn and in every interaction, it was the legendary Four Seasons service that you'd hope for, delivered in an intuitive and under-stated way. --The hotel is elegant. It FEELS like a five-star property, which is in contrast to some other properties that offer five-star amenities but look like IKEA. Wood panels line the guest room hallways. Furniture in the room is sleek but substantial and of very high quality. Bathroom had luxury surfaces. Design is understated and a spot-on mix of classic and contemporary. The bed is fabulously comfortable. --The hotel was QUIET -- while there were a fair number of people in the lobby, it was large enough to never feel crazy; just the right about of buzz. The walls must be very thick, because while other guests were on my floor, once I got in my room I never heard a peep. Very serene. --Gym was great. Spacious, well-lit (including windows to the outside), stocked with a great range of cardiovascular equipment, pulley machines, and free weights. Access is 24-hours, even though it's housed in the spa, which closes. --The hotel's location is wonderful, right off of George St. It gives you great access to the CBD, and you are about a block from Circular Quay. The Opera House, Harbour Bridge, and Rocks neighborhood are all within walking distance; if you want to go elsewhere, Circular Quay is a transportation hub for ferries, trains, and buses. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. A couple of minor complaints: first, the shower drove me a little crazy because every time I took a shower enough water spilled out from under the shower stall door to soak the bathmat and require that I use a bath towel as well to mop up the remaining water (and this was with me conscious of the problem and deliberately aiming the shower head away from the door). Now, the good news is that those towels were replaced at turndown service. However, a plastic piece or something needs to be added to the shower to keep the water in. They have to know about the problem since the housekeeping staff would pick up sopping wet bathmats every day. Second (and VERY minor): while the bath products that were provided smelled great and were of great quality (L'Occitane), I thought it unusual that a five-star place didn't provide mouthwash. I felt the same way about slippers (there were robes, but no slippers) and complimentary bottles of water at turndown. Other five star places provide those; this one didn't. Small in the scheme of things. So why four instead of five on my rating? One issue -- the internet. In-room internet access was $25 PER DAY. I find that criminally expensive -- I mean, what a rip-off, especially considering the already high room-rate. The fact of the matter is it that, for a business traveler such as myself who depends on in-room internet access, that makes this hotel non-competitive. Why? Other five-star properties in Sydney offer internet service that is included in the room rate or granted with compliments thanks to my position in the hotel chain's loyalty program (Four Seasons has no such program). Adding $75 (for 3 days of internet on a 3-night stay) to the cost of your already very expensive stay is hard to justify, particularly for an amenity that so many hotels, from budget through luxury, are offering for free. Furthermore -- and this is what really got me -- after paying that exorbitant amount for access, you get high-speed LITE internet (a fast connection costs even MORE)! This \"lite\" service was functional for e-mail, but nothing else, including downloading small word-processing documents for business purposes. I'm sorry, but if I'm going to be forced to pay that much for internet access, then have it be a fast, reliable connection. So, sad to say, despite delivering so much excellence, I probably won't return to this property, at least on any visit where internet access will be required.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWe had an excellent experience staying at the Four Seasons Hotel in Sydney and will always stay there in the future.\u201d", "Author": "AJMcN", "ReviewID": "UR116230813", "Content": "The staff and service at the hotel were outstanding.

There are plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby and it is fantastic just to soak up the atmosphere on an evening, walking to the Opera House, eating outside and gazing at the perfect view over the Harbour. This Hotel is all you expect from a 5*. I would recommend the Hop-on Hop-off Bus, which can be got fron Circular Quay. This takes in all the main sights of Sydney and if time is a limited, is a good way of getting an overview. The only (slight) downside was the conferences/meetings in the Hotel lobby each day, which meant a lot of people milling around.

There was a bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us in front of the corner window when we arrived. The staff were friendly and eager to assist with anything we required. The hotel's location - a block away from Circular Quay - couldn't have been more perfect for a couple of people looking to explore the city. It's the public transportation hub of Sydney will get you wherever you need to go via land or sea. It was easy to walk through the Rocks district and take advantage of the shops and restaurants therein. We did the Harbour Bridge Climb, surfed Bondi beach, visited Taronga zoo, went jogging through the Royal Botanic Garden, and dined nightly at the fabulous restaurants around the Opera House without ever having to hire a cab. In all that activity, we didn't have time to take advantage of the spa and it was too cold to use the pool (though several Aussies were down there pulling laps in the afternoon.) Americans/coffee addicts may be relieved to see the Starbucks across the street. The area around the hotel explodes on weeknight evenings as the happy-hour crowd celebrates. The Guylian chocolatier/pastry shops around the corner and near the Opera House may ruin someone's diet, but you won't regret the event.

Firstly, I can understand other reviewers when they are disappointed with the standards of the hotel. This was my first stay at a Four Seasons, and although it was good, I wasn't amazed, which I was hoping for, considering the reputation that the Four Seasons chain generally have. However, I paid $245 a night, and for that price, I found it really good. The room is quite small, but with good amenities. We had a large flat-screen tv with a good selection of channels. The bed was very, very, nice and everything else that you might expect such as a minibar, bath-tub, massage-shower, WIFI (at a ridiculous price), bathrobes (but no slippers) etc. was provided. The city-view we hoped for was mostly over a road and a distant North Sydney unfortunately, and we were on a relatively high floor, the 17th. One of my biggest disappointments was the swimming pool. At first glance, it looks alright, but the pool deck is at a closer look quite worn and old, and I've experienced better pool areas in many hotels that aren't ranked as 5-star. Additionally, there were dead bugs, and hair, floating around in both the pool and the jacuzzi, which of course wasn't very nice. But there aren't just negatives. The service from staff at front desk was very good. We requested a late check-out and got a 2 pm check out straight away when asking, we also got champagne-glasses and a bucket of ice within five minutes of requesting it. The service in the bar was also very good, a small delay for our drinks resulted in a complimentary glass of champagne, and you additionally get complimentary truffle popcorn and toasted nuts with your drinks. Very nice touch. The location of the hotel is also fantastic, and you are meters away from Circular Quay, the Rocks and so on. We also had a quick look at the gym, and it looked good with individual tv-screens, cold towels, and four different complimentary drinks. So all in all, this might partially sound like a very negative review, but in general the Four Seasons Sydney is really good. It's not spectacular however, and for $245 a night, that's fine, but as I mentioned earlier, I can understand the frustration from people paying more than that. I'd say it is a strong four, and with a nicer pool area, and small touches like free WIFI this would be five star.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cAlways a pleasure to return\u201d", "Author": "coralkiwi", "ReviewID": "UR114695534", "Content": "I have stayed at the Four Seasons Sydney several times now on business, never more than 1 or 2 nights at a time unfortunately, since each time has been a pleasure.

The hotel is only minutes from the Circular Quay with its access to the ferries to outlying spots such as the (wonderful) Taronga zoo, as well as just a few minutes of a walk to the beautiful, picturesque Royal Botanic Gardens, and another quick step to shopping along the section of town called The Rocks. Staying at the Four Seasons Sydney, you are just a hop, skip and a jump from the Opera House as well. All of these things you definitely should go see when you're in Sydney. But you should stay elsewhere. I'd recommend Googling hotels near the Four Seasons and checking their rates against this hotel. I think you'll find that you can stay more cheaply, as elegantly, and be just as close to the amenities as this hotel is. Here's the problem: If you think Sydney is expensive (it is - current exchange rates are $0.75 American to $1 Aussie) you're going to REALLY think the Four Seasons at Sydney is pricey. And, there's very little bang for the buck. Let me see if I can tell you about some of my gripes: * The maid never could get it right in our room. We'd put our stuff out in the order we wanted, she'd take and stack it all up on the shelves, rearranging everything. * I was locked out of my room one time because the maid was in there servicing it. * The bathroom scale had a dead battery. I ordered a new one, it had a low battery. * We needed to make a phone call back to our credit card merchant because we accidentally locked the card trying to purchase a ferry ticket. A 1-800 number would have cost--now get this: $9.00 for the first minute, $4.00 for every minute thereafter! We emailed the card merchant instead and the problem was rectified within 24 hours. * Average room service meal was $35, average drink at the bar $17. (For comparison: A pint of beer at Jackson's on George across the street is $9.00). * Internet WiFi service: $25.00/24 hours. Really? C'mon. There are ways to make money, but shellacking folks on WiFi is truly a ridiculous way to do it. (Jackson's across the street has free WiFi, BTW). There shouldn't be anyone charging for WiFi these days. That's a royal rip-off. * The bedspread was a coverlet that was really hot. There was no alternative: Either you slept hot or threw the coverlet off and froze. While the bed was comfortable, there were few sleeping options. * The spa was outrageously priced! A couple's half-day stay was $900. The cheapest spa treatment I saw was $300. Just absolutely ridiculously priced. * The fitness center was just OK. It had an elliptical and a couple of treadmills. There were a few weight machines. Nothing fancy: You could find the same thing at any adjacent hotel. * The pool was outdoors and would be really cold when we were there (May in Australia is late fall, early winter). OK, it's really great that smiling courteous Aussies hold the door open for you, but t the end of it, it's just not worth the kind of money the hotel charges for absolutely everything. And, our hotel suite, with corporate rates was $300/night. You can do better by at least $100/night (and get free WiFi) as long as you're willing to walk an extra block or two to get to the Quay. Sydney Central Business District (CBD) is laid out very well, with easy walking, plenty of restaurants, ATMs, and other amenities all throughout. You could stay up in Hyde Park, a distance of a few blocks, much cheaper, and be equally as happy with your proximity to the Quay.

The front staff was exemplary and i must bring Rebecca to the attention of the hotel as she went above and beyond for us. Our room was an upgrade with a view of the harbor but it was still on the small side. The next day she put us in a larger room with even a better view! The staff at this hotel, Sarah at Breakfast, Rebecca at the front desk and the amazing Oscar the Concierge, just to name a few...are what makes this hotel reach almost the quality of a 5 star hotel. If the romms received just a tweak to certain details, and we did stay in two types of rooms, this would be 5* luxe without doubt. Don't get me wrong, the rooms are lovely and clean and full of amenities, but...the bathrooms could be bigger and there is a bit of wear and tear on the walls and corners of the small room. They could use a bit of polish. The bedrooms are lovely. The bed is possibly one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced at a chain hotel and of course you have your flat-screen TV and contemporary upscale hotel furniture. Nothing breathtaking about the rooms..but still, very attractive contemporary style decor. The Gym is tops as is the staff. I was happy to see a 'real gym'with a large assortment of cardio and lifting options. The Beeakfast is in the 'top three of the best'... we've ever had at a Hotel...along with the staff.

For me, it was simply unimaginable. I always thought the four seasons was the finest hotel in Sydney. Not just from the leisure aspect but also from how it's run, the business side of it It's not like you just walked in the hotel and you're looking to book a room from the get-go. In that case, I could care less if the rates were up due to the hotel being full. But it's a lot different when you tried to book for a room, and you're being informed that the room will be booked and has been booked on two occasions (for a standard room, $295 for one night). And when I double checked again for the second time, it was reduced to $225 for one night, while the room was booked as it was confirmed on the phone. One standard room with harbour view for $225 for one night. And we took it to granted like you would expect. On the same day of the supposedly, booking confirmation on the phone, my girlfriend and I went to the hotel expecting the room to be reserved. To our amazement, not only did we find out the room wasn't booked. but the rate had gone up. Had the room been booked in advance like it was suppose to, we would have paid $295 instead of $325 (when the rate went up on that day). If the room wasn't booked like it's shown on the computer, then there's no proof that we booked. But, there's no denying the truth, we were told it was booked. So, decision was made, pay the extra cash and deal with it later, and that's what we did. No need to be confrontational around people. Play it smart. The real issue isn't really about the extra $30 dollars, it's about respect. Clearly, in the hands of other people's Incompetence, it makes our life frustratingly more difficult. This is something that shouldn't occur at a 5 star hotel like the four seasons. I felt insulted , perhaps even cheated. Was it a case of a poorly managed fiasco or was it more sinister, perhaps a delibarate tactic, a trap; Claiming, 'there must have been a mistake, we had no idea what happened'. so they charge us more, 'oh the rates have gone up today'.

The Sydney hotel ranks in the bottom 3. Everyone can agree that the location is great but the same can be said for a number of other hotels. On the whole, the personnel are pleasant and friendly and the linens are typical. Thats the good news. The problems with this hotel primarily concern the physical facilities, especially the rooms, and on the whole, poor management--the hotel is making too much money selling an inferior product to make changes. As to the rooms, we had the premier room--the one in the picture with the beautiful view. I t was good size but the furniture was a \"mish-mash\" of styles that must have been taken from other rooms over the years. The furniture was old. The hvac didn't work well and they couldn't make it work to my satisfaction. The bathroom was small. poorly lit and the shower cubicle was so small that there was no place to put my razor. And this id the better room. We were also shown an executive suite which, frankly, was an embarrassment. Considering that the normal rooms are 1/2 the size of ours, I don't know how anyone could be satisfied if the stay is more than a day. why spend this kind of money for an inferior product. Tried to eat in the bar on 2 nights and it was a fiasco. We waited 15 minutes for them to split a hamburger and then left in frustration. The breakfast is uninspiring to say the least. Much of the problems with the physical facility is that this was a Regent hoterl and not built to Four Seasons standards. Now here is what really gripes me. On checkout, I not only filled out the customer satisfaction form and e-mailed my comments. There was no reply just like their is never a management response to any of the critical reviews on this site. I attribute this to poor management. We were planning to return to this hotel and the end of our trip but stopped in to look at the Observatory Hotel and we changed our plans.

It's a very nice hotel, with great views of the Opera House. It's also very close to the trains and ferries, and the area called the Rocks. Location can't be beat. Bed was comfortable and room was nicely decorated, if a little small. Not quite as small as a European hotel room, but smaller than an American one. Closet space was minimal. Loved the L'Occitane bath products! :) Wifi is NOT included and if I recall correctly was $25 or $30/day - which is overpriced and felt like a rip-off. We did not have breakfast as it's not included and is quite expensive. For our birthdays I pre-ordered a piece of cake to be delivered to the room. I thought for the $30 I paid it might be a nice size (at least enough for 2!) and it was a small single-serving piece. Fortunately they removed this charge at check-out, perhaps because I mentioned our 40th birthdays. But if you do want cake - there are several cafes with great desserts for a lot less money just a short walk away. Do yourself a favor and don't pre-order any amenities like that. We were on a higher floor (I think the 15th?) and could still hear traffic from the street, so it's not very noise-proof. Hair dryer did not work upon arrival and had to exchange it for one that did, and reading light above bed kept shutting off - problem was never resolved even after calls to maintenance. Concierge was helpful with maps, restaurant recommendations, and umbrellas. This hotel seemed mainly like it attracts a business travel crowd, and seemed to cater more to that than vacationers.

The views from the front rooms are wonderful and to be honest the only reason we stayed for the duration of our visit to Sydney. The location was great - in addition to the superb views it is amongst the historical Rocks area with several restaurants nearby (not just those around Cicular Quay which are more expensive). THE ROOM The rooms are small but then it is a city hotel squeezed into a cramped space. Our room was quite high up but we still heard lots of noise from the street, the trains and the freeway. The sound proofing is poor. The furniture was out of date and well used but functional. Inadequate drawer/hanging space for 2 people who were staying 8 nights. The bathroom was small and much too basic for what was meant to be a 5 star hotel. Small touches were absent - e.g. there was only one box of tissues in the whole place. The bed was large and comfortable. The worst feature was the a/c. We had engineers in the room frequently because it was so cold. (Despite what they say - Sydney is NOT blessed with great weather and it was grey and showery most of the time we were there). In the end we almost always had it switched off which meant the room was airless but at least not freezing. FACILITIES The pool is very small and basic. The loungers are not great and there was no service unless you phoned for it. It was not possible to sit there for long because it is located directly alongside the freeway and hence there is constant loud traffic and the associated smells. Men can reach the pool directly from their changing room but women can't - they need to go through the gym or up or down in the public lift and walk through the hotel. We didn't use the Executive Lounge as the cost was exorbitant and from what we saw and heard the 'extras' provided were not worth it. We did use the Business Centre (in the same place) which is free and the staff were always very helpful though it closes much too early (8PM). EATING The breakfast was acceptable but not 5-star range or quality. Over priced for what you got. Dinner - mixed experience. The 'small plates' evening was excellent. Good food, great service, lovely wine and excellent value. However on the evening we had the normal menu it was a complete let down. The waitress spent almost all of her time chatting at one table ignoring all others. My request to have the caesar salad without croutons resulted in a salad being delivered without croutons or chicken or bacon - in fact just leaves and some dressing! The wait for another attempt at doing this resulted in my partner and I eating our meals separately (there was no offer to re-do or save his hot meal) and this ruined what was meant to be a romantic meal. Also - our glasses of wine were noticeably considerably smaller than the next table who had asked for the same thing ( NO - they did not ask for large glasses). SERVICE Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful though the door staff seemed to select favourites to open the doors for! There was a long delay in our luggage coming up to our room - we would have preferred to just take it up ourselves than kick our heels for 30-40 mins. This is not a 5-star hotel but provided you accept that and the niggles you would have a good stay. All in all, provided the exchange rates improve, because the location and views are so good, (and because we've now learnt some lessons), we would stay here again if we go back to Sydney though we hope that the niggles get sorted (especially since several people have mentioned the same things).", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel with convenient location, but had expected more..\u201d", "Author": "XploreBuddy", "ReviewID": "UR102086211", "Content": "Stayed here for 6 nights with two rooms during Sydney Mardi Gras 2011.

But what stood out was our meal in Sailor's Thai Restaurant at the Rocks, George Street. The setting, service, and every dish were all outstanding. Also that old favourite, the Golden Century in Chinatown, super-fresh seafood which you select from the tanks, and reasonable prices. Against this, was the Four Seasons Hotel. It fell short of our expectations of the usual standards of a Four Seasons - no slippers in the bedrooms, dim lighting, poorly informed junior concierges, really slow check-in. Plus points were excellent temperature control in the rooms, and its spa. The Head Concierge was knowledgeable, pleasant and efficient. The bed was great, as was the view (of the Opera house) from the room. The hotel levies a surcharge if you pay the bill by credit card (and who doesn't?). Watch out for unscrupulous taxi-drivers, check the approxmate price of a trip before you leave the hotel.

The Premier Room (which we booked through whatahotel.com) was spacious and large, though the bathroom was a bit small. The other rooms in the hotel are reputedly small, and they certainly looked that way as we passed by them. The hotel did not upgrade us, as it was supposed to do for those who use Four Seasons Preferred Partner agents. It also did not quite get the service right--both check in and checkout were slow (there were several errors on the bill). The restaurant service was erratic, though the food was quite good, if not quite excellent all of the time. (This was true at breakfast and at dinner.) The spa was fine, though probably not among the best. The doormen were often chatting amongst themselves or just plain absent. Prices are generally high, which one expects at Four Seasons, but the service was a consistent disappointment. To add insult to injury, the hotel charges a 1.5% service charge if you pay with a credit card. Since no one had told us this when we booked, and since the person who checked us in wrote directly over the minuscule sentence on the form where it states this, we got the fee waived. But it felt tacky and wrong--hotels of this sort rely upon credit. If it intends to do this, it should just increase its rates and drop the fee--rather than burying this information. Other Four Seasons properties get service much more than this property, though it wasn't terrible. It just did not meet expectations for a five star hotel.

As the train approaches the hotel the tracks bends and most of the trains let out an extremely loud fog horn type sound. This horn noise comes straight into the room making it impossible to sleep. After complaining we were moved to the 20th ish floor, which was much better. You could still make out the train's fog horn but it was distant and wasn't loud enough to stop us sleeping. Essentially the soundproofing of the external windows is very poor. Most of the rooms are also extremely narrow and small for the grade of hotel. The pool is badly sited next the loud train line, and freeway ramp, and it didn't have changing rooms directly next to the swimming pool which meant you had to walk along one of the lobby upper corridors to get to from the changing rooms so we didn't bother using the pool.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting because I remember reading an article about how the Four Seasons ardently protects and oversees its brand, which summons so many thoughts beyond just baseline disappointment in this property. Bottom line: this is not a Four Seasons in the sense we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to know the brand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service, rooms, aesthetic, amenities, condition of facilities, and nickel-and-diming-free environment.

But, really, there are other hotels with stellar locations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Park Hyatt would be an obvious choice for this type of stay. As a gentlemen we met in the elevator said as we collectively laughed at the scrolling electronic ad pushing the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Executive Club for a mere few more bucks(!): if he weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t writing his stay off for business he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have been actively complaining about the same things that annoyed us.

I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall these things at other FS properties. To wit: had to pay for water in rooms; none in fitness center or pool except containers that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always replenished (or they lacked glasses so useless); they charged $10 for a printout of an international newspaper (even the most remote hotels of lesser name will toss that in gratis); $30 daily internet charge for inconvenient and sloooowwww connection; use of the 32nd-floor \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business Center\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was inconvenient and ultimately worthless even for printing boarding passes because the 3 computers were in constant use (hostess wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even let us in - told us we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just have to keep checking back and said she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do printing for us; the poor, unseasoned service at the (extremely lame) spa and concierge desk (late 40s couple asking for a charming wine bar option and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re told to walk to the loud party bar beneath the opera house instead of the two wine bars we found 1 and 3 blocks away the next day?); pool and spa closed by 8:00; pool and other public areas are outdated and depressing. Even the elevators were slow and often packed with tourists and luggage cart-pushing bellmen (no service elevator?). It often took us two to three tries to get an elevator with room for two of us. Finally, the rooms: we had a suite and it was dark with odd layout and dinged and scuffed wood; peeling wallpaper in bathroom. The bathroom layout also odd w/ unfortunate 1980s brown marble; products tossed on the counter like an afterthought. We saw the regular rooms and they are tiny boxes even by New York standards - opera view helps but still. Noise-sensitive guests beware: the rooms are not well sound-proofed. We heard guests in rooms and constant street and highway noise (highway right outside our window). Sydney, is not exactly a great hotel city, but Four Seasons needs to seriously step up or sever this weak link.

The location I cannot fault. Service in general at the hotel was excellent the only complaint I would have is that breakfast can be a little slow....if you opt for the buffet. There are three choices for breakfast, all held in the same room. Continental which was included in our room rate at $36, a sunrise special buffet at $42 and a specific menu with individually priced. I got the impression that the hotel wanted to push this and gave those customers who ordered from this better service. My main annoyance was that having told the waitress that we were on the continental buffet and asking what this included we were told everything, and therefore for the three mornings we stayed we had everything. When checking out however it turned out that we had been having the sunrise breakfast and that this was not inlcuded in our room rate and therefore the hotel made attempts to charge my partner and I for the $42 per breakfast each. We managed to argue with the hotelk about this and were not charged in the end. I however think that a hotel of this standard should not be employing tricks such as this. Service in the bar at night was also rather slow. We opted for a harbour view room. Admittedly you could see the opera house and Circular quay however the view wasn't great and if I was to go again I would not opt for this and get a cheaper room. The rooms themselves were well equipped, had nice furnishings and quality toiletries. They were cleaned to an exceptional standard twice a day.

Good value options close by are Jackson's on George which is right across the street and the take away joint called Seafood on the Quay (or similar name) for fish and chips.

Don't make local calls; we were charged $40 for two phones lasting no longer than a total of five minutes.

Normally we stay at the Sheraton on the Park which we love, but given our experience in Turkey we decided to give the Sydney Four Seasons a go. I really can't fault anything - we booked a basic Harbour View room and had a stunning view of the bridge and opera house. We had added in an excutive club package, so perhaps as a result ended up on the 28th floor which was great. As soon as my husband saw the view he set up his tripod and camera and spent much time taking photos at different times of the day. Room was small but more than adequate, bed and pillows excellent. The Club was good - quite empty, which made a change from the Sheraton where it is a fight to the death to get a place to sit. Also you could help yourself to drinks which made it much easier than waiting for your initial drink. Breakfast was excellent with a chef on duty to make omelettes. Service was friendly and prompt. One thing we liked was the noon checkout - much friendlier as we don't like rushing to leave. However we were expecting a bit more after the Four Seasons in Sultanahmet e.g. there when we came back to the room we found book marks in all the books - a very thoughful extra. The doorman there knew exactly who we were and was very eager to offer assistance. In Sydney it was raining one night - we left the hotel, paused for a minute to consider the rain and then sent my husband back to get an umbrella. He had to convince the doorman that he was a guest and get one. I feel that we should have been asked if we needed an umbrella as we left or there should have been enough guest recognition that when we asked for one we received it without hesitation. We plan to stay at more Four Saesons hotels overseas, until I find out whether the one in Turkey was unusual or representative. I think we will probably stay at this hotel again, although I am not quite sure whether the 12 o'clock checkout and quieter club is enough to warrant the premium over the Sheraton. It was really just a standard Sydney 5* - nothing wrong but no wow factor either. (Of course we are probably quite blase about the harbour and opera house, so maybe for overseas visitors that would add something a bit special).", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "beirut", "Title": "\u201cgood location,large room,beautiful lobby,pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "achif", "ReviewID": "UR84511879", "Content": "like all 4 seasons hotel in general,you cannot be disappointed .we had a nice stay,rooms was large, quiet,comfortable,and a very good location.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Views Can't Get Any Better!\u201d", "Author": "alegria310", "ReviewID": "UR84364674", "Content": "My husband and I spent our 2 wedding anniversary at the Four Seasons Sydney. Oh wow, the location can't get any better! It is right next to the Circular Quay with unobstructed views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. The Rocks neighborhood is within 5 minutes walk so there are lots of restaurant and shopping options. The Royal Botanical Gardens are about 10 minutes walk away for some quiet time in the city. Sydney is expensive, and so is the Four Seasons! We had originally booked a city view room, but since it was our anniversary, we chose to upgrade to the harbour view room. We were blown away when we walked into our room and looked out the window. The night view is just fantastic if you take a look at the pictures I included in this review. We went up to the Sydney Sky Tower and we both agree that the view from our room topped it by far. We couldn't even see the Opera House from the Sky Tower because of all the buildings in the way. So if you are going to stay at this hotel, you might as well upgrade to see the harbour, or else you can save money and stay in any other hotel in Sydney for a lot less money. The hotel sent us a nice reserved bottle of Champagne for our anniversary and wrote personalized notes to us. Definitely a nice touch! The one piece of warning I have for travelers using the concierge desk is to avoid Huey like the plague. The other people at the concierge were very knowledgeable and helpful. The two times I talked to Huey, I felt like he had no clue what he was talking about. For example, I told him I wanted romantic harbour view dinner for our anniversary. He said that Darling Harbour was too commercialized and so he sent us to Wallomooloo area. We ended up at this pier with no sight of the harbour and instead had views of docked boats. On top of that, the restaurant he recommended had horrible service. The other time I talked to him, I asked him for the exact location of the Japanese garden within the Royal Botanical Gardens. He promptly responded by saying there's no Japanese garden there. When I walked through the garden, I ended up seeing it and I felt like he should not be a representative of the Four Seasons.

The hotel was first rate all the way, with a very attentive staff, and the location was absolutely unbeatable. The hotel is located right at The Rocks and Sydney Harbour/Opera House, two of the best places in Sydney to hang out. The Botanical Gardens are a short walk away, or a great place for a run. The rooms were very tastefully furnished, clean and modern. The staff was great. I was on business in Canberra and my wife flew in to join me when I was done. She arrived in Sydney a half a day before me, so I called the hotel and asked for them to arrange for flowers in the room, a spa appointment, and early check-in if at all possible. They took care of all of it without a hitch. When we'd come in from our morning run, the doorman always greeted us with a cold bottle of water as we walked back into the hotel. It's the little things like that that really make a difference. I can't remember the price we paid, but it was actually pretty reasonable. Maybe it was low season (coming out of winter but still pleasant when we were there), but I was surprised at the rate. I think it was better than the Marriott which is right nearby and that surprised me a bit. I've stayed at the Marriott, the Hilton and Four Seasons, each more than once. All three are nice. I like the Hilton - it has a great gym with a lap pool inside and the rooms are very chic - but the location is not as good. It's still only a 15-20 min walk to the Harbour, but why not be right there? The Marriott was nice and the location is just about the same as the Four Seasons, but I think the Four Seasons was nicer all around.

Originally built as the Regent Sydney in early 1980s this Hotel has been a rock in a market that has evolved and changed with the on going growth of Hotels in Sydney. So how does she rate??? The room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the biggest hotel room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in but was very well appointed in general, The bed was ultra comfortable ( Little surprise Four Seasons sell these beds on the open market ) the facilities in the room very good, but the as well appointed as the bathroom was it was somewhat small regardless of all those lovely soaps and shampoos. A good TV and Sound System reasonable Internet if required and a good view rounded out the room. The Four Season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is located at Circular Quay offering easy access to everywhere in the CBD and moments walk to the Rocks area, Opera House and Sydney Ferries as locations go its pretty much perfect for Sydney ( Little wonder in later years the Shangrila and Quay Hotels opened in neighbouring blocks ) The location is hard to be critical of. Parking is strictly a valet proposition unless you want to use the nearby parking garages ( expect up to $50 per day ) Bus Stops and Trains are in a moments walk. Service is fast and efficient, The welcomes warm and the atmosphere classy. Bags arrive promptly which is always a good thing. The lobby has a very busy vibe to it and is very lively, The hotel features a wide range of distractions, The shops are nothing amazing or special particularly, There is a nice pool, apparently a highly rated spa according to all reports and 3 Restaurants in total. Sampling the lobby bar I can report it does A mean cocktail an ideal way to finish off any day with a nice Jazz trio that cool not loud and really gives the place a nice ambience. At $50 for 2 Cocktails its not the cheapest bar in town but hey you have splurge sometime. The in house restaurants includes Kabels which still enjoys a fine reputation a legacy of its even grander days but does not have the aura of exclusivity it used to once enjoy more due to Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very fickle dining culture than any failing on the restaurants behalf. The Lobby restaurant always had a reputation for solid food likewise. It can be argued the place lacks depth in choice and does not have the top class buffet the Sheraton on the Park has traded with for a decade or more now. There are no shortage of dining options in nearby areas which include many of Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best dining options. The Four Seasons is not A cheap hotel. Regular rates can be pricey and in a cut throat market like Sydney can be viewed as over the top, however savy shoppers can regularly score a bargain, if you put in the research in order to savour what is one of Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better hotel experiences.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cWOW!

The person attending to us was messing around on the computer saying she needed to find us a room. She went off to speak to a manager who had a discussion in front of us about where to put us!! then we were told that we had a room and we were given the key and that someone would be to our room shortly to remove something from the room as it was someone else's room!!! - when i questioned this the lady was a little short with me and didnt understand why i would be questioning this. She told me that a member of staff would just be collecting something and would be gone. I dont think we needed to be told any of this and this should have been sorted out whilst she was serving us. Anyway the room itself was a full harbour view room, it was a beautiful room and was worth paying the extra for the view. The room had all the extras and nice touches that you would expect from a four seasons/5 * hotel. The bathroom was large and L'occtaine bath products to use. The bed was so comfortable we didnt actually want to leave. The hotel is in a fantastic location and you can see the majority of the major tourist spots on foot. There is circular quay station less 5 mins walk away and there is a number of restaurants and bars and pubs right next to the hotel. The concierge James was fantastic and very very helpful, everything you wanted to know he had an answer for and more times than not produced a leaflet to help you with.

A lovely touch. We were particularly impressed with the fact that despite the \"poshness\" of the hotel, no-one looked down their noses at a couple of scruffs like us in our shorts and flip-flops on the way out to the beach for the day. Having had deals like this before, We have often found ourselves obviously out of our league but not so with the Four Seasons. Food and drinks reasonably priced in the hotel itself (even room service which was available through the night). And situated directly across the road is the James on George pub which was excellent and friendly and also very reasonably priced with entertainment most nights. The hotel has excellent views of the Opera house and Harbour bridge depending where you are in the hotel and the very best rooms have views of both. Superb outdoor pool and spa which is available to all guests and also massage facilities etc. All in all a very lovely hotel right by the railway station and ferry services within easy walking distance of downtown Sydney or Darling Harbour with all its delights.

We booked a Premier Opera View Room, with a special 4 nights for the price of 3 promotion direct through the hotel. Our room was on the executive club foor (level 32). The free night made this category room more valuable. The rate did not include breakfast but the Hotel were happy to provide buffet breakfast for an extra $50 total per night. So we had the breakfast on the first morning but then indulged in the many cafes near by in the Rocks district. If you want a luxurious experience in a large room with a bathroom big enough to be a small apartment, then this place is for you. The L'Occitane beauty products are a plus, as are the lovely dressing gowns and slippers provided. The Hotel also provides rooms with a daily newspaper upon request. The only 2 negatives about the Hotel room are: (1) the bed - if you like a firm matress, you won't like the bed. The mattress is extremely soft and has a top cushioned layer that can't be removed. My husband slept like a baby but I tossed and turned the first night and had to sleep on the couch on the second night. It was a real struggle for the Hotel to find us a firmer matress- they only had one which was being used on our first and second nights. Luckily it became available on our third night. Slept really well after that. (2). If you book a Premier Opera View room for the view, you may be dissapointed. The picture on the website suggests that you can see the Opera House from the bed. This is quite decieving. On one website the room was described as having \"sweeping views of the Opera House\". The onyl thing sweeping about the view is that you need to sweep from one side of the room to the other in order to see the Opera House. Because of the Hotel's architectural design, you can only see the Opera House if you stand right in the corner next to the office desk or sit at the desk. This is due to one of the Hotel's exterior wall blocking the view. There is only one Premier Opera View room on each floor of the Hotel, each being in the same location on the floor as our room so this problem would exist in any Premier Opera View Room. Otherwise, our stay was delightful and the location of this Hotel is ideal. The staff are extremely professional and attentive and the service is great. Would recommend this Hotel to anyone coming to Sydney for a short stay - pretty expensive for a long holiday. The gym is the biggest I have ever seen at a Hotel and the pool areea is lovely - they even hand out free strawberry smoothies to guests in the pool area. The Eastern Distributor (freeway) and train tracks run right along the Pool but we didn's find that this detracted from our experience at all.

To return from a day out and enjoy a night time view of the opera house and the Harbor Bridge is something that I will never forget. The rooms are not large or plush, but the room was clean and comfortable. This is a city hotel, not a resort. The buffet breakfast, included in my rate, was well above average, and the servers were on the ball with numerous different newspapers and plenty of advice.

We hadn't been able to book previously but Tina got us in because she knew the manager. Crucially for me, I was able to give the details to Tina, then go and do some sightseeing, and Tina would have updates waiting for me when I returned. Therefore she totally owned the issue so I didn't need to worry about it. Great service. Also, Jane in the Executive Club lounge was very friendly, courteous and helpful. I had a problem getting my phone to use an Aussie sim card, and Jane helped me by letting me try the card in her phone, and also called the phone company for me when I found the website unclear. Brilliant service again. Other staff I met, particularly at breakfast, were also great. 2) The breakfast was superb - a great selection of fresh food. Everything you could imagine. And the breakfast restaurant is on a mezzanine level overlooking the lobby which is great for people watching and creates a lovely vibrant atmosphere. There is a great pianist playing too. It's a great place to stay, particularly for exploring the Rocks area, ie the Opera House, Botanical Gardens, Sydney Harbour Bridge, and getting ferries from Circular Quay.

We arrived early in the morning, after very long flights with two children, and while willing to hang out by the pool (though we had to change in a small, un-airconditioned bathroom) for several hours, we were frustrated that even by 2 pm, when it was raining on the pool deck, and despite repeat responses from the front desk that they were expediting our room, we still had no place to relax. VERY unlike receptions at every other Four Seasons hotels we have stayed in - essentially very impersonal and unconcerned. Although reception told us we could \"absolutely\" begin charging food and beverages (our package included a F & B credit we wanted to use) to our room, the pool staff regretted that they couldn ' t find us in their system and we had to dig out a credit card The POOL, while perfectly clean and adequate, was not huge and quite ordinary, and right by an expressway (rather a surprise when billed as \"the nicest outdoor hotel pool in Sydney\"). Again, nowhere near comparable to any other Four Seasons facility we have encountered. POSITIVES: The SPA was far nicer - the staff warm, helpful, and very competent, and welcomed the whole family in to the showers when the rain forced us off the pool deckand we had no where to go (the lobby seats seemed full, presumably of other poor souls waiting for rooms to be ready). I enjoyed a relaxing massage and the steam rooms, and the lime water was the kind of thoughtful touch that DID seem up to standards. The FOOD was also worthy of the Four Seasons name (and price). The \"continental\" buffet breakfast was extensive and fabulous - including smoked salmon, cheeses, all kinds of breads and fruits and juices.

The Concierge Desk was beyond outstanding as I interacted with them on a daily basis from restaurant suggestions, directions, the best place to purchase hand rolled cuban cigars, tourist attractions, they even four friends and myself access to a private nightclub on a Saturday evening at the last minute (Luke and Jorge are outstanding at their jobs and excute everything in a professional manner, well done gentlemen). The Four Seasons location is excellent for accessing all the city has to offer while not directly \"on top\" of all the hectic touristy locations. The only hotel that I consider in the same category in Sydney with the Four Season is the Park Hyatt which is somewhat inconveniently located in my opinion. While in Sydney I stopped into the Westin at Martin Place (which appears to be a newer property) - the room size was OK, but the Westin lobby lacks the intimate feeling of the Four Seasons and instead feels more like a mall than an upscale hotel and is annoyingly loud. As a comparison, by the 2nd day of my stay at the Four Seasons the lobby staff was addressing me by name. The view from my room was outstanding (Harbor View Room on a high floor) - generally speaking the room furnishings were adequate and what I would expect from the Four Seasons, although I have stayed in other Four Season properties with more updated rooms. Overall room comments as follows - rooms are a tad small, bathrooms are a tad small as well, nothing that impacts the overal stay, but worth mentioning.

I was there for six days (leading a conference) and got to know it well. The good: It's extraordinary clean and unbelievably shiny. The staff kowtows constantly, and smiles and says \"good day\" at every opportunity. It opens every possible door for the guests. The OK: The exercise area, although small, contains a good selection of equipment. The pool is satisfactory given that it's located in the middle of an urban area. The showers are good, except that sometimes the water pressure and temperature suddenly changes when taking a shower. The bad: The rooms are very small. The windows are angled so that 30% of the view is blocked by the wall of the adjacent room. The lower rooms look directly into the nearby neighboring buildings and nothing else. The mattresses are way too soft. The service, while extended with cheer and smiles, is terrible. For example, our original access to the room was delayed for \"10-20 minutes\" while it was inspected. After an hour, we gave up. We were then told we'd be telephoned on our cell phone when it was ready. Never happened. We were also told our luggage would be waiting in the room. Also never happened. We asked directions to a certain store. We were quickly and cheerfully given the directions, but they were incorrect. The meeting room (Ballroom 1) was a disaster. External sounds of equipment being moved, constant sound of some sort of loud beeping, and occasional very loud music intruded to the point that the speakers could barely be heard. This continued over all three days of the conference. The internet was pricey (as usual with such hotels) but was slowed down to the point that internet surfing and email reading were the only feasible activities (which I never previously have experienced). Forget therefore trying to view a U-Tube video, for example. The breakfasts (c. $US 35) were poor. The scrambled eggs were a strange combination of undercooked and overcooked. The omelets were dry. The selection of pastries was limited (and a basket of three cost c. $US 15). The tone signaling an elevator had arrived seem to emanate from the center of the bank rather than one of the five elevators themselves, with the result that one had to search to find which elevator had arrived. Since the signaling lights are blocked by ornamental lamps, it was necessary to scramble feverishly to reach the car before the door closed, and, if it was an end car, more likely than not one would miss it. (This happened to everybody at the conference.) In short, if you like superficialities, this is your place. You'll get smiles, greetings, and will view acres of clean shiny surfaces.

Upon our eventual arrival via taxi we weren't in a very good frame of mind, thankfully this was all about to change rapidly as the friendly and efficient staff gave us a warm and seemingly genuine greeting and had our bags whisked away to our room. My wife was ecstatic when we walked through the door to our room and saw the tasteful and modern furniture. I expect that the hotel has been recently renovated as everything appeared to be very new right up to the Samsung 46\" LCD tv. Very unusual to see a brand name tv in a hotel, in fact most rooms I've stayed in have brands that I've never even heard of before or since. It was this sort of attention to detail that really made Four Seasons stand out from other hotels fro me, even the bedside clock was a Bose wave system and until you've heard the sound quality of one of those you wouldn't think it possible for such a small unit to produce such rich sound. The bathroom in the Premier rooms was quite large and finished very lavishly in all its marble glory with a modern oversized bath tub and spacious shower. We didn't dine at the restaurant as we already had bookings at some of Sydneys best which are all just a short stroll from the hotel including 'Quay' which has just been awarded the Gourmet Traveller 'Australias Best Restaurant 2009' for the second year running and of course Neil Perry's famous 'Rockpool' restaurant is only about half a block away. If you're looking for a great way to see the harbour we also booked on to 'Captain Cook Cruises' 'Gold Deck Dinner' which includes a 3-4 hour harbour cruise aboard a luxury vessel and a seven course degustation dinner with matching wines. The bar is open for standard drinks as well so it works out to be a fantastic cost effective evening and a very romantic evening as well. Look around on the web for deals as you can often find tickets cheaper than on the Captain Cook Crusies website. We booked through Viator and saved about 25%. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Four Seasons and would definately stay again although after walking around Circular Quay for a few days I would also be very keen to try the Park Hyat as it would have to be in the best location of all the Circular Quay hotels, might have to save a bit longer though as it's even more expensive than the others.", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Florida, Florida", "Title": "\u201cJust Perfect!!\u201d", "Author": "Besitos22", "ReviewID": "UR38793772", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights!

See my other reviews on Crowne Plaza Darling Harbour (disappointing) and The Westin Sydney (really good stay) which were all part of the same trip. We arrived about 1pm. Check-in took slightly longer because we were prepared to wait for an additional 15min for a room on the 30th floor with Opera House view. Worth the wait. We also paid to upgrade to Club Floor access. Standard rate of AUD135 per room/night was reduced to AUD85 because of a short winter promotion. And we also got another AUD100 in credit which we used to offset the upgrade. So all the promotions made this a very reasonable stay. The bed was very very soft but comfortable enough. The only problem was waking up at 1:30 in the morning because the pillows gave me a neckache. Concierge promptly sent foam pillows but I still had problems sleeping. All I could think of was Westin Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pillows and bed. But the next morning, I called housekeeping and they promptly sent another pair of pillows, this time they were made of latex. THAT made all the difference. Finally, I could look forward to a proper night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep! The room is much smaller than the Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but it was also more cozy. Loved the interiors design and we had a lovely view of the Opera House. The FS provides travel adapters etc but not much toiletries. No toothbrush, toothpaste, bedroom slippers etc. I guess you could call housekeeping for them but we brought our own. The toilet was half the size of Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but good enough. The shower was great. Separate bathtub. I was only worried that the hairdryer would fall off the shelf and into the toilet bowl. The hairdryer wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that heavy and pretty powerful. The housekeeper was happy to change the bathrobe each day, unlike Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The concierge was very precise. I asked how much it cost for a taxi ride to Westfield Bondi Junction and they said AUD20-21. I actually paid AUD20.30. So I decided to take the bus the next day and bring my hubby there. The Club Lounge was terrific. The staff and their high level of service must be commended. The cocktail hour 5pm-8pm daily had very limited but very good quality food. The drinks, including liquor, were all self serve so you mix and match as you wished. The soup of the day, kept warm in a thermos flask, was smooth and rich. The mini cheesecakes and tarts were delicious. 6:30am to 10:30am each day, the limited breakfast was great. The sugar powdered pancakes were soft in the middle and thick and crispy at the edges. Eggs were cooked to order and there were bacon, sausages, baked beans, cheeses, smoked salmon etc. I had pink guava juice every day. Location of hotel: Superb. The Rocks and Rocks Market is only 5min walk away and you must eat at Wolfie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the Village near the Rocks. Really good steaks and sauces. We walked 5min to the bus information counter in front of McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposite Circular Quay. This newsstand-like counter gave us helpful info and we walked across the road to Stand E where we boarded the express bus 333 to Westfield Bondi Junction (you must go there, probably biggest mall in Sydney) and also to Bondi Beach. The limited stops made the trip faster and costs about AUD3.20 one-way. I had considered staying at the Shangri-la instead of FS but each day, looking down from the 32nd floor window of the Club Lounge made me thankful that I need not walk up all those steps to get to the Shang. Yup, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really glad we chose the FS instead.

The gym is great with 4 or 5 quality treadmills, ample bikes, rowers, weight machines and a stack of free weights. The pool is handy in summer, whilst heated, it can be a bit chilly on the deck in winter. The day spa is recognised in Sydney as one of the best. The only weakness I would call out is the lack of a quality bar and narrow restaurant choice. But to be perfectly honest, hotel bars are generally full of the boring types and being located at Circular Quay near The Rocks, there is no shortage of local watering holes and dining preferences. For business: Great location right on George Street, well appointed to get work done when you need to in your room with fast web, good quality desk and chair. For pleasure: Perfect location for Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Also located directly opposite Circular Quay ferry station, where you can take a ferry to Manly and other tourist destinations.

Looking at their site it seemed the best bet at the standard rooms were a tiny 280 square feet. Location: The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic, just across from Circular Quay a two minute walk into the Rocks and about five round to the Sydney Opera House. Ambience: Not quite the usual Four Seasons, nice entrance and friendly welcome. The public areas of the hotel did feel a bit ordinary, luxury hotels often stand out not only from their public and private areas but this just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the wow factor. Room: Plenty spacious with nice view of the Opera House (as we had a very high floor) from the window in the living area. Good storage space for cases with desk and large bathroom too. My only disappointment with it was the fact the large bathroom had no windows which with a view of the Sydney skyline would have been fantastic, one way glass of course! Also our room had old style Nokia CRT televisions, even mid range hotels have flat screen HDTVs now so this was a bit of a surprise. It seems more recent reviews note that rooms have these. The room did feel a bit tired, the desks had been bumped a few times too many and the carpet looked a little worn in places. Otherwise, very comfortable bed as usual with L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane toiletries (love them!) Facilities: To be honest we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take advantage of much of the hotel facilities favouring restaurants in the city.We did see the pool round the back of the hotel which while quite nice did have the hum of the Cahill Expressway running just above it! Service: Usual Four Seasons excellence! We used the concierge to score an excellent table at Aqua down beside the Opera House (a really fantastic meal) which we were unable otherwise to get. Staff were very friendly and gracious as has become expected at stays at Four Seasons everywhere. Even the young kid hailing the cab outside was great! Also had a few items dry cleaned and was very impressed with the speed there too. Other nice little things like the fact a pair of rather tatty shoes I left on the floor in the room were polished and left beside the bed. Summary: The only disappointment was the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and furnishings of the room. Flat screen HDTVs should be standard at any high end hotel and the room was in need of a refresh. Other than that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain, the location is absolutely fantastic. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fork over the extra cash for a harbor view room, might do that next time, I bet the view from the high floors is spectacular.

What I mean by this is lots of florals and very traditional. If that is your sort of hotel then this brand will suit you down to the ground. The website showed that the hotel had undergone significant refurbishment so I thought I would give it a try. I have to say that the rooms (mine was an Opera House view) was very understated with a very modern feel to them. They are certainly not large rooms but a comfortable size none the less with nice brown, caramel and white tones. The bathroom is a good size with a separate bath and shower. The L'Occitane amenities are always welcomed. The room was booked through American Express Platinum Travel and as it is part of their Fine Hotels programme there are extra inclusions (breakfast for two, US$85 to spend etc). This certainly made it very appealing. Check-in was very friendly, infact the welcome at the door was great. Even better was being provided with a A$100 credit to use as I was staying for two nights. Dinner was had at the casual restaurant and the food was just fine and very well priced for a five star property. The maitre d' was also exceptionally friendly and his service was impeccable. I also recommend the cosy bar on the ground floor, again, great service from the bar staff. One surprising highlight was the fitness centre. Most hotel gyms have one or two tradmills, a bike and a machine which defies scientific explanation. This gym was well equipped with a number of cardio machines, free weights and weight machines all coupled with a view over George Street. The one area that disappointed was breakfast. The service from the staff was fine but not exceptional and inconsistent. Further the breakfast offerings were very standard. I found the eggs to be dry and a little tasteless. The juice on offer was very tart. I would have also expected to see an \"Egg Chef\". Really, if this is all I have to complain about then I am being too picky.

Had a city view room on 29th floor, while not the more popular (and no doubt more expensive) view of the Opera House and Harbour, the city view still took in The Rocks, Harbour Bridge, Walsh Bay and harbour west of the bridge - you weren't stuck looking straight in to another building or directly into other hotel rooms.. The room had a very comfortable bed, reasonable space for two, 42inch LCD, DVD player and the usual amenities you might expect. Liked the shower's separate temperature control, so you could vary the water pressure and temperature independently. Went to the inhouse restaurant - Kables - which had strong reviews on www.eatability.com.au. Food was very good, wine expensive, staff were attentive once you were seated, bookings recommended over Fri/Sat/Sun, we saw people turned away - it's not a value proposition but worth it if you want something special. There are no booths or secluded tables, you don't feel isolated from other diners. Staff on reception desk and room service were extremely friendly, helpful and efficient, couldn't have asked for more. Parking cost ~$45 per 24hr period - might be on par for city rates during the week, but seems poor value if you can't expense it back to an employer. Being based in Sydney the location wasn't terrible important, but if you were a tourist in this city then this hotel is conveniently located to transport hubs and touristy things. In summary, I'd go back for sure if I got a promotional rate. If i was traveling for business or money was no object I'd go back as well.

The Circular Quay is great for taking ferry trips (we went to the Zoo and Manly Beach). The hotel is literally a 3 minute walk from the train station so the airport ride is a breeze. You are also a very short cab ride (or a moderately long walk) to Chinatown or Darling Harbor. The room was clean, the safe in the closet was large, and there were 2 luggage racks in the closet.

Lovely L'Occitane bath products too!

The concierge did lead me astray, however, when I inquired about seeing a koala--I was told I would be able to lightly pet a koala at the Taronga Zoo, however, when we got there, I learned that they apparently have a strict no-touching-koalas policy. That was the one disappointment I had with the concierge. The bad: The room was quite small. Definitely better suited for one person than two, but we didn't mind much as we were out doing activities during the day. Also the \"opera view\" was really only an opera view when you stood in the very corner of the room, however, I know other rooms were considered \"Opera View\" and did have very lovely views of the Opera House from more vantage points in the room, so I suppose we were just unlucky.

The room was basic, no extra blankets in the wardrobe to change the down bed covers to something light as the air conditioning wouldn't drop below 20c and this in Sydney's hottest month. No complimentary water, telephone books, no toothbrushes, nail files and shavers. The bathroom was so cramped, the hairdryer had to stay out on a shelf above the toilet. Classy. No drawers or cupboards to put toilet bags in and when you are travelling with a 22 year old, they need cosmetic space! I had to get up on the first morning to quieten the housekeeping staff who where opening room doors, shouting \"housekeeping\" then letting the door slam shut. I pointed out there were 4 \"do not disturb\" signs on the rooms in the immediate vicinity which would indicate people sleeping - or trying to. I mentioned this to the front desk but the whole scene was repeated again the next morning. Breakfast was in a tired cafe with even tireder staff. I had to ask 3 times for an order to be taken and at no time was water put on any table and again had to be requested. The only indication that this was a Four Seasons in a previous lifetime was the Concierge service and the doormen who were helpful and professional. So overpriced, tired, and tiny.

We stayed at a total of 8 properties during our 3 week trip to Australia and this is the only one that will be getting a negative review. Firstly the plus points- fantastic location which could not be better, and stunning views of the bridge and Opera house. The concierge were very helpful and friendly, the guy who brought our bags up was lovely, and they were also able to recommend some good restaurants. For me- thats it. The room itself was very tired, the furniture was a bit 80's and although everything was very clean, it just did not have the high quality finish and look I was expecting for a hotel chain with this reputation. It just was not in my opinion of 4* quality. Another thing which I really found irritating was the lack of mirror over the dressing/writing table. The only mirror for applying my make up was in the bathroom, and it may just be me but I like to sit down in front of the mirror and take my time getting ready! I guess if we had not paid so much for the room I would not have had such an issue but I just felt it was not good value for money. I also think it did not help that we had stayed in a Shangri La hotel in Hong Kong and not only were the rooms stunning but they absolutely gave us the special treatment. The other major gripe I have with this hotel is that there were definately some form of room refurbishments going on while we were there on the floor above ours. On the first day we arrived we were very tired from our flights and attemtped to have a pre dinner nap at around 4.30pm, however there was very loud banging and drilling from above. I called reception and explained and they told me there was work going on but it would be finished by 5pm. I asked if this was going to continue throughout our stay and was told it was but that it would only be between the hours of 9am and 5pm. I was not really happy with this as we were not warned of any refurbishment when we booked, but I decided to let it lay as figured I was probablly just grumpy from the long flight and lack of sleep! The next morning I had to ring reception again when the work had clearly started at 8am, I was prettty much fobbed off and told as far as they were concerned it was not supposed to start until 9am. Nobody came back to me and I relaised at that stage nobody was interested. The next morning as we were leaving there was drilling from above which started at 7.30am. Its not even so much the noise that upset me but the the complete lack of service that went with it or follow up of my complaint. The hotel does need some updating so I can understand why it is going on but I feel you should be made aware when booking if you are going to be disturbed by noise during your stay. Another thing which I found a little annoying was that twice they came around to do the turn down service at around 6.30pm whilst we were getting ready to go out for the evening.

Particularly the front desk which has a collection of snooty youngsters with a total lack of a service mind set. An early arrival is always fraught with problems (one has little choice about when to arrive due to airline schedules). To be lectured on the \"official check in time\" is not much appreciated after a long and sleepless journey.

For that and a old Nokia TV (yes Nokia) and shabby sofa with stains you pay $600 per night.

Bad mistake. Firstly, once the booking was made we were trying to organise airport transfers thru concierge. The guy we were dealing with just could not comprehend that there were 3 of us. He continually confirmed everything for 2 pax. We had booked a full harbour, opera house and circular quay junior suite for an average of $800 per night. Upon arrival at the room whilst the view was fantastic the bathroom took up the corner where most of the views would have been. The bathroom was tiny and you couldnt have more than 1 person in there at a time. The wardrobe was on the other side of the room so you had to walk out of the bathroom and thru the room to reach the walk in closet. Crazy room layout. More on the room layout - the old old TV faced the bed and completely away from the lounge area. The desk chair blocked the entrance to the bathroom. Anyway, we went out for dinner expecting our sons rollaway bed to appear after dinner. What did appear was that the lounge was rolled out to reveal a sofa bed. Really? For an 18 yr old boy at $800 per night. The mattress was approx 2 inches thick. My husband went down to front desk to request a proper rollaway bed. He was told that for the room we booked the sofa bed was what was offered. FOR $800 per night in a junior suite!! Yeh NO! After some discussion a rollaway bed was bought up and I have attached photos of the quality. This was basically the standard of this hotel overall. Very very tired. Some positives - the location of the hotel is great, the food is good and once we got there concierge was very helpful.

The outdoor hotel pool and spa are also good, but again dated and the pool service is OK but yet again not up to the Four Seasons brand.

The restaurants have terrible service (especially at Breakfast) and the quality of food is exceptionally poor for a 5 star hotel. Its no coincidence the restaurants are rarely busy. I'm amazed the managment hasn't spotted this and attempted to improve the food and service. I've stayed in most Sydney hotels in my 7 years of business and holiday travel and all in all this is a perfectly good hotel, in a great location, with OK service However, it isn't worthy of the Four Seasons brand and is letting them down.

The day before arrival I reconfirmed a large vehicle by email for 13 suitcases for the two large families and received the hotel emailed confirmation. At the port having not been met and waiting for forty minutes the families walked the two hundred metres to the hotel leaving me with the suitcases. i was left for two and a half hours standing in the blazing sun because the hotel had not arranged the vehicle. I arrived sun burned and more than a little annoyed, I had phoned at least six times and was always put on hold and got no where, and this was on a Spanish mobile phone calling Australia. By way of my family going to and from the port to the hotel we eventually got transport. This hotel is used by the cruise ship companies and therefore it was literally a chaos at the hotel with the huge amount of arrivals and departures on that morning, something to bear in mind if booking this hotel. On arrival I was told that their would be no charge for the vehicle and they arranged a free airport drop off two days later. I know mistakes can happen but when you receive written confirmation of your instructions and are paying 630 dollars a night you really do expect it to be right....and it wasnt. The hotel room was a junior suite full harbour view on the ninth floor. The view was excellent of the Opera House and bay. The room was really very average, dull and a little tired, it had nothing positive to comment upon other than the view. The lobby and bar area are also very normal with little to comment on. I took my son to the swimming pool which has to be the ugliest I have ever visited, it is continually in shadow and has no natural ambience being in a concrete surrounded area next to a railway line. The water was very cold bearing in mind we were in peak summer. In brief the hotel is very well positioned for visiting the rocks area and the Opera House and the views from the full harbour view rooms are very nice but that apart the Four Seasons Sydney is a well worn ugly city hotel with little charm. This hotel is well below par from its sister hotels from the same chain. Sydney is a beautiful city and everywhere is within a short walking distance.

I was there strictly for a holiday and to sight-see. I booked a small suite on the Executive Club Floor, and that's exactly what I got. As others have noted, the hotel has seen better days. It has a very \"tired\" feel to it--the furnishings are aging and the facility itself desperately needs an upgrade. I spent a lot of money on my room--overall I think the value received was reasonable but not great. My room, located on a high floor, did have a nice view of the Harbor, including the Opera House and the Bridge, but neither window was posiitoned to see the entire Harbor, either while seated at the desk in the small sitting room, or from the bed in the bedroom That was a MAJOR disappointment, since I booked the room based on the view. The only way to get a nice view was to stand by either window. That being said, I did enjoy my stay. The Club had continuous servings of food throughout the day, including a fabulous breakfast (they had a chef prepare eggs to order) and nice evening heavy hors d'oervres, and after dinner drinks with a nice selection of premium spirits. The Club Concierge has to be rated as one of the finest I have ever experienced. She made every effort to make recommendations about restaurants and places of interest. Since I only had 3 days to explore, I tried to make use of every minute--and her help was invaluable. Little touches really helped, like arranging to have breakfast delivered gratis to my room early on the day of my departure. A major disappointment, though, was her inability to push a reservation at my first-choice restaurant--I understand that it is difficult to reserve at the last minute, but at least she tried. The room itself was laid out fine except for the positioning of the windows. There was a nice working desk, a small sitting area with television (neither television in the sitting area or bedroom were a flat screen---they should definitely upgrade), and a small wet bar. The bathroom was very small, though with a separate walk-in shower---I wish it were designed to have its own window looking out on the Harbor. The bedroom was small with a comfortable king bed. I did spend an hour at the outside small pool. The pool area was cozy and well laid-out, and the service was very attentive. Location was great--walking distance to Circle Quay and the Opera House.

Our first two nights cost AUD$350/night including the buffet breakfast (weekend special), and our third night was AUD$350 with no breakfast. We thought it was a great deal, especially the weekend special. There's a reason that the Four Seasons has a great reputation - great service. We had reserved city view room for all three nights, but we were upgraded to an opera view room for the first two nights and then a junior suite on our third night. Almost in every Four Seasons we've stayed at, we've been upgraded. It's really smart of them to do that - it doesn't cost them any more and it goes a long way in terms of good will. The hotel itself is not what I normally think of when I think of a Four Seasons hotel. It's more like what I call a \"conference hotel.\" Maybe it was something else before. It's a high-rise building, with a more business-like feelng. It has a great location by the Rocks. Very convenient to everything. The front desk person was very friendly, courteous and efficient. We were able to check in even though it was before 9 am. That was great, especially after getting off a long international flight! In terms of the rooms themselves, we can't complain. We had a great view of the Opera House from the 32nd floor on our first two nights (we asked for a room on a high floor) and then also on the 12th floor on our third night. The rooms were comfortable, as expected. The junior suite was huge. The buffet breakfast, as you would expect, was very good. The service at the concierge was a bit uneven.

The FS brand usually markets itself on absolute quality, immaculate service and unforgettable experiences. FS Sydney however excels in some aspects but is definitely hamstrung by the quality of its rooms. Rooms - the rooms are the weakest link to the hotel. They are definitely on the small side, okay they're TINY. The bathroom is also small and is only sectioned off by a sliding door. Not much privacy if you're rooming with someone else. The views are good, but much better from the Shangri La. Decor wise, its definitely time for a re-furb. With the like of Hilton, Westin and Sheraton being newer hotels (or recently re-furbed), FS will continue to struggle. The hotel is due for an 'interior refurb' in 2007 but whether this means new rooms I'm not too sure. Cost of in room use of broadband is definitely on the high side. Service - this is the one area that FS excels at, however after staying at this property over 4 years the level of attentiveness is beginning to loose its shine. Services provided by porters and doormen can be hit and miss. Reception is very good, always welcoming and very efficient. Room service is generally very good. Housekeeping is excellent. Food - I've only ever ordered room service and its been good. Prices however are definitely on the high side, but expected. Not a huge fan of the restaurant ambiance so I've never eaten there. Being so close to the Rocks, much better to talk a walk and eat there instead. Spa/Health Club. Health Club facilities are good, spa treatments are done in very relaxing surroundings but once again, prices reflect accordingly. Overall, staying at the FS, the service shines through and makes my stays there generally very pleasant and memorable. Travelling alone, I don't mind the small rooms but I can see how it can be a problem when 2 or more are travelling. Is the FS Sydney same as other FS's around the world, probably not. Can you get a room with a better view, definitely yes, but does any other hotel offer the same level of service, probably not. This hotel still remains one of my favourite hotels in Sydney.

Even the service was simply not up to scratch, there were so many mistakes made - a room service order took 1\u00c2\u00bd hours to arrive, despite the fact they said it was on its way when we called to check after 50 minutes (clearly they were lying); when it arrived, the main courses were lukewarm (despite having been in a hot box - but by then we were so starving, we just ate it); the ice cream on the side of our dessert order was completely melted; we had the wrong pudding delivered with another room service order; and, our laundry and another room's was mixed up - and it took over a day to sort this out and get it back. When my boyfriend telephoned to complain at about 6pm one evening, we were informed that the hotel manager had already left for the night. We left a message with the person we spoke to for him to call us. When we left, four days later, the manager had still not returned our call. It started to make sense why the service is so bad - with a manager with that attitude, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not surprising and the rest of the staff don't stand a chance. As my boyfriend said, \"I've stayed in 15 other Four Seasons around the world and this one is definitely at the very bottom of that list.\" It might have great views, but we won't be going back. Next time, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stay at the Hyatt.", "Date": "February 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "huntington beach, california", "Title": "\u201cNot on par with Four Seasons' other properties\u201d", "Author": "bikinigirl", "ReviewID": "UR6807368", "Content": "This is just NOT a good property.

Before arriving, we had some qualms about staying in such a large, commercial hotel because we were concerned that it wouldn't be as personable as smaller hotels or that it wouldn't provide a \"local\" experience. We were, however, more than pleasantly surprised upon our arrival. The staff were very friendly and low key, while also incredibly efficient. We had many requests during our 4-night stay, and each request was met quickly and with a smile. It was particularly helpful that our room was ready more than 3 hours before the scheduled check-in, and we were upgraded to a full harbour-view room. The views of the opera house, harbour and harbour bridge couldn't be beat. The restaurant at the hotel was excellent with a very knowledgeable staff (as was room service). The pool area and spa were also wonderful treats at the end of a long day. The location was ideal, within a 5-minute walk of the rocks, the ferries and shopping (and a 10-minute walk of the opera house). It was an ideal \"home\" during our trip to Sydney. In sum, the hotel was truly focused on hospitality--I'm not sure I've ever stayed somewhere that was run so well at every level (check-in, housekeeping, room service, the spa, the restaurant, arranging reservations and activities in Sydney, etc.). The only downside (if I must give one) is that the rooms are a bit smaller than the other hotels in which I've stayed in Sydney (the Park Hyatt and the Sir Stamford). But the large picture window overlooking the harbour and the excellent service more than made up for the room size (as a side note, I would recommend booking the full harbour view instead of the city view in the event upgrades aren't available).

Last Sunday afternoon she went into both the Shangri La and the Four Seasons and made enquiries about room rates, welcome packages for children etc. The receptionist at the Shangri La looked over her head and spoke to the back wall and stopped answering her question halfway thru to serve another person...basically he dismissed her....bad choice... The Four Seasons explained what was on offer and gave her a written pamphlet with room rates etc...no prizes for guessing..she chose Four Seasons (and yes the reception area was just as busy!) I made the phone booking from home and was told if we came in a little early our room would be ready..we arrived just before 1pm and it was... 32nd Floor with full harbour view..not an upgrade but certainly a fantastic spot.. The Room.. The Four Seasons is the old Regent and room sizes are still indicative of the 70's build. Small but clean and well furnished. All things required and Occitane products in the bathrooms. Fluffy towels etc as you would expect. The Pool... We hit the pool around 3.30pm and were given lounges (no problem finding one) and served with iced water. Service was similar to asia..prompt but unobtrusive.. Our cocktails (smoothie for her) took around 10 mins and an apology was given for the delay!! (I don't think 10 mins to make a cocktail and smoothy is an excesively long time) The pool was perfect temperature and a few noodles (foam) and kickboard were supplied. The pool area has more lounges and space than the nearby Hyatt the only drawback being the few trucks on the Cahill Expressway Food.. We didn't pre reserve at any restaurants so we ate in house at Kables. Food and service equal to any five star restaurant in Sydney (prices to match but that's no surprise). The only drawback would be the lack of view. There was plenty of space and wonderful attentive service. Breakfast was part of our room rate so we dined after a short walk out to Dawes Point. Plenty of variety and the \"baby smoothies drunk thru a chocolate\" straw were only surpassed by the best hot chocolate ever (not as good as a brenner tho) as it was frothy and had lots of marshmallows as required. I enjoyed the array of fresh fruit and egg white souffles.. Service.. As good as any we've had anywhere.

No queues for check in, check out, or breakfast. Staff who genuinely seemd happy to be of service. Location.. One of the best spots in Sydney..convenient for all the Quay attractions and esy to get around..not uphill like the Shangri La but being high rise high enough to have a wonderful harbour view..slightly better than Intercontinental as i think more rooms have views of the bridge and Opera House...the price tag of course indicates this Now all i need to do is convince Guru to take me for a \"romantic weekend\" Sorry no photos..i put the battery on charge and left home without it!

The service is decent and staff is pleasant and helpful. The hotel, however, is nothing special, certainly not near the standard of some other Four Seasons Hotels. Rooms are very small and smoking floors absolutely stink with cigarettes. I have never stayed in a luxury hotel where this was so bad. Given the time of the year I was not able to change to a non-smoking floor, but luckily the staff could arrange for the room window to be opened and this was very helpful. One night I found a huge cockroach in the bathroom, which was needless to say not very pleasant. The decor in the rooms also is nothing special and the whole plays looks like it could use a makeover. Given the choice I would try a different hotel in Sydney such as Park Hyatt, Westin or Shangri-la before coming back to the Four Seasons.", "Date": "March 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Sydney location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4454051", "Content": "I recently treated my boyfriend to a weekend break in Sydney.

The pool is fantastic particularly the cabana tents, the pool staff were very helpful and friendly as we enjoyed a delightful afternoon by the pool. The front desk staff were equally attentive and ingratiating. The breakfast which was included in our rate was impressive catering for all. The location of the hotel is superb. Minutes to The Rocks and the Opera house and ideal for a short stop over in Sydney.

Comfortable beds in ridiculously small rooms. Considering this is an older hotel, the decor is acceptable. The concierge staff is the best thing about the hotel. They are consistently helpful and attends to you immediately, well, at least the male ones do. Cab drivers may still refer to this hotel as the Regent or mistake your destination as Four Points hence it's always good to say George St after you've said Four Seasons. A lot of tour groups--especially cruises--stay here and that places a lot of stress on the staff, which is reflected in the degree of cleaniness in my room (well, they could be old stains). Horrible coffee. Breakfast buffet is average. Lunch is good. I am concerned about the competence of the front desk staff though. They are poor in customer relations and executing their job responsibilities. I will spare the details here as they are too long to write. The management keeps promising better service the next time and despite repeated stays, I have to say that there is still much room for improvement. If you don't mind climbing up a small slope, try the Shangri-La. Huge rooms with much better views than the Four Seasons. The staff is also more sincere in assisting customers and are incredibly good in team work and noticing customers' needs. This should probably go to the Shang's review. All in all, this is not your typical Four Seasons where you receive 5-star service and 5-star accomodations.", "Date": "February 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGREAT LOCATION, Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ChiTown2", "ReviewID": "UR4334907", "Content": "Checked into the Four Seasons for four nights leading up to New Years Eve after four nights in the Park Hyatt.

View of the Opera House was not so great and lack of opening windows made us long for the fresh air of the Park Hyatt. Service was very good overall, including the spa. The gym and pool were very nice. Breakfast in the restaurant was nice- a buffet with menu service- but not as nice as the Park Hyatt. Excellent, well informed conceierge desk staff.

It cannot be beaten for overall value. There are some other lovely hotels in Sydney eg. W, Park Hyatt (a personal favourite), but the Four Seasons presents the best value without a doubt. The location is great, if you can get a harbour view room on a relatively high floor, you will not be disappointed. Whilst being very used to the amazing service one experiences throughout hotels in Asia, and always being shocked and disappointed when visiting hotels in places like Australia and the US, I find the Four Seasons service to be great - and I am a fussy camper. Yes the rooms are small, and the desk faces the wall, which is never pleasant if you need to do some work in your room, but try to get out and about and enjoy Sydney for what it is. There might not be many TV channels, as mentioned in someone elses review ... but again ... who cares! You shouldn't be in Sydney to sit in your room and watch TV. The down side would be that the rooms are noisy ie. doors closing in rooms next door etc. Many of the staff are knowledgeable and friendly, but not over the top.

We actually stayed there for a two week period as we were staying in Sydney for the entire time. Hotel is in a great location, we got the train from the Airport and when we exited the station there was our hotel which was a delight after our long travel time. Check in was great and we were upgraded to a Harbour view room (after reviewing Trip Advisor before we knew what we stood a good chance to get upgraded from a city room). We got food delivered to the room that night and the waiter setup a table beside the window. It was a prefect view of the harbour and a great introduction to Sydney. The room itself is very small and for a five star hotel they do need to address this. They also should have a complimentary business center so that guests can access email for free. The roomrate should cover this cost. We ended up going to a Kinkos near the QVB to access our email. Also they do hold a lot of conferences, so when one comes back to the hotel it is rather busy. On another night they had a awards cermony for the cricket players going on, they had a ton of security people around that were very ignorant and rude. The hotel should not forget about it's guests during such events. Overall the hotel is very good, if they can address the room sizes then they will be little to compalin about.
