{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Stayed during the Olympics; Overall good experience I stayed at the XiaoXiTian branch during the Olympics. Room rates were around $100US a night during that period. Pro: Free Internet In Room; working A/C; relatively clean premise; quiet; English speaking manager; safe area; supermarket, breadshop, and 24hr restaurant with english picture menu right next door; ATM machines close by; daily room cleaning service; working TV; Con: Sewage odor creeps up from the toilet, sink, and shower drain - Pick 4th floor or higher if you can. Had to wire transfer the entire payment in order to secure the rooms (had to put a lot of trust that this is a legit operation). Not near subway. Taxis cost around 30RMB to get to Chaoyang district. Make sure you get the manager to write the Address and the cross-street/directions to the place on a paper for you to hand to the taxi driver. Taxi drivers may not know where exactly the address is.

I stayed total 7 nights. 3rd floor rooms are bigger and nicer than the 2nd floor. Rooms are clean except there foul smell in the toilet, guess it's the poor sewage system, however still bearable. Room was not clean daily during my stay. There are 2 computer at the reception, internet access for free. Staff were friendly. Laundry service was cheap. Overall with the price paid, could not ask for moreHotel is a 15 mins walk from Qianmen subway. Once you get out from subway take the exit 'C'. Then you need to use the underground tunnel to cross over to the other road. Most of the road sign on the small roads are only in Chinese..", "Date": "May 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR790832770", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "jeremy65"}, {"Content": "Amazing bar in the lobby!

We had a 2-bed room with ensuite which was very clean and had aircon, TV etc. There was also free internet access in the lobby, and the accom. was very reasonably priced so we had no complaints at all. The hostel has a restaurant/bar out front and there's a really great atmostphere all round. Also, it is very central (just a few minutes walk from the Forbidden City). The hostel is located right in the middle of shoppers heaven and you are surrounded by hundreds of small shops where bargaining is the only way to go. We definitely recommend 365 Inn - clean rooms, very reasonably priced, centrally located and a great atmosphere.", "Date": "Nov 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR646664378", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cweir"}, {"Content": "Clean and cheap       My room 311", "Date": "Sep 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR574991304", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Botman"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d634581-r19059657-365_Inn_Beijing_Xiaoxitian-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "634581", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
