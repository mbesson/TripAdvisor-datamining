The hotel could be cleaner, services are alright, but in no way it's a 5*. HEavy Xray control at the entrance. All floors and all rooms have a carpet. Not the best for a clean hotel. Bathrooms are huge in Deluxe Rooms. Two showers. Views are excellent from any room, even any height. The hotel has 28 floors. Don't even bother clinbing up to the roof restaurant. Nothing really happens although you may feel tempted by the beauties offering a night-life experience. Let's be clear: the ONLY reason to stay here as a tourist is because for some reason, you are attending T\u00c3\u00bcyap's fair. It's barely a 10minute walk. Unless you rent a car, you're miles from Istanbul. Miles meaning a one hour drive to Taksim (150 TL), a 40 minute drive if not too much traffic to the Airport (70 TL). There's nothing within walking distance from this huge building. NOTHING. You're 10 minutes by cab to this coast place which is pretty and there's life. If you were to stay a week in the Fair, I would suggest ESER hotel in this coast village. At least you can go for a walk. Internet access was good and there's 2 PC?s available, 24h. Poor colour printer. Breakfast wants to ressemble those open-buffets from good Spanish hotels, but the products are all pretty dodgy. Yes there's scrambled eggs but they don't taste like them. Yes, there's orange juice but it tastes like honey.

Now the down side, its miles from anywhare. The food is basic, and never vairied. One evening I asked for fish ( there was no menu), and received a trout, and on checking out I noticed that I had been charger 34 Lira, that's \u00c2\u00a316 or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19 for a small trout. That is not only ridiculously expensive, but was more that the most expensive item (fillet steak) on the room menu. Which brings me to another issue, in your room you will find the usual hotel directory of services, within this is a section on food, and lets say, for example, you selected smoked salmon, the price listed would be HALF that listed than if you referred to the same item in the seperate room service menu. When I challenged this at the front desk, they could not answer why the outragious variation. It gets worse............ the usual bottles of complimentary water were left on top of the TV (mini bar was locked), on checking the bill, they were attempting to charge for them. Nowhere in the room did it state that these would be charged for, they embarrassingly removed the charge. When I asked to speak to the manager (Mr Turgay Bayar), regarding the above, I was told that he was in a meeting.....I hope it was a meeting about customer service!

Some aspects of the service were fine - for example, when I asked for tea cups, they were delivered promptly. There are four reasons why I have rated this hotel as being so poor. 1 - at reception while waiting to be served, they decided to serve two (white) people before me. Then one person (who was putting blank keys and cards into a drawer- clearly more important a task then serving me) that his colleague would serve me. His colleague finished off what he was doing and told me that he (the first person) would serve me and walked off. Clearly you are better served here if you are white rather than Asian looking. 2 - they refused to give me a note to say how long I had stayed on the basis that they only gave a receipt when there was something to pay (the airline were paying in my case). I pointed out that they had given something to another person. They denied this until I brought that person over and showed them what they had given her. Even then they gave me what I wanted but clearly reluctantly. 3 - I exchanged some money and was not given the correct amount. Surely their staff should be able to do simple maths or even use a calculator. 4 - they wanted to charge me 4 Euros for some milk for tea!. Throughout all of these experiences, not one apology. Others have said that this hotel is in the middle of nowhere and this is correct. The room was fairly spacious but lacked tea/coffee facilities, which I think is atrocious for a supposedly 5 star hotel. And the air conditioning barely worked.

There are three restaurants plus one bar where you can eat burgers or fried potatoes. Two are at the second floor, but one of them is often closed and the other, where morning breakfast (very good) is also served, often offers buffet dinner (the quality of the food is good, not so the choice) . The third one is on the top of the hotel, nice view of the lake, if you choose the right side, and nice food. If you choose this third option be prepared to talk a lot or, if you are alone, take with you a book, the service is not the fastest I have ever seen. The bar is good for a beer while you are playing billiard but not so good for eating. If you really cannot live without a cheeseburger, mcdonalds is 200 meters far. Kaya ramada is in a strange area. the neighborhood is a mix of residential/commercial/industrial area and is also next to a trade fair center. Except mcdonalds, you can find few restaurants in the middle of the buildings beside Kaya. Never tried. If you are looking for a nice place to go, there is the Sinan bridge in Buyukcekmece (4-5 Km). It is on the lake I was talking about before. In that area there are a couple of nice restaurants and also the public turkish bath. I suggest this hotel for Business and meetings.
