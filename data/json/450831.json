Well...my holiday in Bali is totally spoilt because of this hotel! I don't understand why all travellers gave the best review.Yes,i admit that the environment of this hotel is nice compare to other hotels in Kuta as it is full of balisani feel.But i must say if you are a asian,please consider carefully and deeply if you want to choose this hotel as your stay.It is so unfair that we are given a small corner room with no bathtub although we booked a deluxe sea view room!We were totally suprise and dissapointed as they thought we don't know anything about the hotel room!We had read so many review and the western travellers said that the deluxe room come with big bathroom with separate bathtub and shower.After our complaint for the first night,we were transferred from room 413 to 411.The reason they gave us is all the deluxe room is full for our 1st day stay.This is so unfair to us!Despite of the hotel room,the breakfast is terrible too!For our 3 days breakfast in this hotel,the staff is obviously like to serve western people only!When the western people just sit on the table,the staff will quickly come and serve them by asking them want coffee or tea.But for us,we sit there for so long but they never come and approach us!We have to approach to the staff and ask them make coffee or tea to us.What's a big differenece the staff at this hotel to treat western travellers compare to asian travellers!Besides that,if you plan to have a free and easy tour in Bali,i would not recommend you to choose this hotel because of its location.In this website review,it said that the distance to Kuta takes around 20 mins only.Well,this is true if there is no cars on the way to the city.But in fact,everyday we took about 45mins to Kuta as the road is so narrow and too many cars on the road!Furthermore,there is no nearby restaurant or shops around the hotel area.This hotel location is the furthest hotel compare to all other hotel in seminyak or kerobokan area.So if you plan to have a nice holiday with own free and easy tour,you should consider stay in Kuta area or Seminyak area.You can easily get any nice food and beach aorund this area.Bear in mind,the beach at Grand Balisani is so terrible with black sand only!No surfing or water sport at all! I know my review is too long....but i really feel that this hotel is not that nice as described in this website!So travellers especially asian people...please don't choose this hotel! I will definitely choose Hard Rock or Ramada hotel in Kuta area!", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR440524968", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "JacQute"}, {"Content": "Perfect Perfect Perfect       sunset", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR853640731", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Hayleynow"}, {"Content": "Loved it... Just came back from my first trip to Bali and absolutely loved it. The hotel was cute and well kept. Loved the aged look which gives it authenticity. It's a medium sized hotel which we liked and there was a nice mix of all age classes and nationalities.We stayed in two rooms (the villas for the first two nights coz our rooms were booked) and then the normal garden rooms. Both are very nice, recently renovated. The villa had a beautiful bathroom but for our liking the garden rooms are totally adequate and basically offer everything you need (clean and nice bathroom, international TV, DVD player, decent storage space, room safe, minibar, balcony...)The hotel is a little outside the more touristy areas of Seminyak or Kuta however with a free shuttle several times a day and taxis being cheap it was actually always nice to come back to the peace and quite of the hotel! It takes less than 10 minutes to get to Seminyak by the hotel shuttle and another 10 to Kuta, so all totally feasible.There is relatively little around the hotel (apart from a few building sites when we were there but none of them were at all disturbing). Seminyak was better for both shopping and dining as far as we were concerned, but both Kuta and Jimbaran are worth a trip or two.The hotel food is totally adequate. For my personal liking the breakfast choices were a little limited. I would have preferred more fresh fruit choices but that's really looking for faults :-)We only dined in the hotel twice and the food was good and totally reasonably priced. Most people when we were there dined out so we basically had the restaurant to ourselves.The general service in the hotel is totally lovely. All the staff were very friendly, forthcoming and attentive.Since the sea at the hotel is rather rough (high waves and strong current) swimming is not really feasible, which is a shame. That makes the pool the only alternative and i would have preferred it a little larger coz if you are after long swims it's not suitable but for the occasional splash around it's ok.The beach itself is nice, it was clean whilst we were there and since the hotel is rather secluded there is a very limited number of people trying to flog things on the beach to you, which i thought was a blessing. Go further south to Seminyak or Kuta and there is way to much wanna massage, wanna sarong...:...?The spa was under construction during our stay so unfortunately no pampering but the massages at the hotel were still on offer and defintely worth it (especially at the bargain prices).You can also book several trips or sports through the hotel, but at the hotel itself there is little activity on offer.All in all it was a lovely stay. The value for money was excellent (3 of us spent less than 300\u9227?for 2 weeks at the hotel (including lunches, a few dinners, all the drinks and several massages).I am sure there is nicer hotels in Bali (we took a stroll through the InterConti and a few others) but they were all on a much larger scale and a bit too stiff... u get the feeling that you have to slap make up on for breakfast and i certainly dont need that on holiday.We definitely will come back and there is no reason that it wouldn't be in this hotel.", "Date": "Jun 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR223944353", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Germangirl_8"}, {"Content": "Beautiful, quiet hotel On my first trip to Bali, I felt a little overwhelmed with the choices of where to stay. I read reviews and narrowed down my choice to this hotel for my days on the beach. I was very happy with pretty much all aspects of my stay.The main pros of the hotel are: beautiful grounds with lovely landscaping, nice breakfast buffet overlooking the ocean, spacious room with fantastic bathroom, lovely pool with swimup bar.The main cons are: rough ocean (not suitable for swimming), you have to take a cab everywhere (this could be a pro or a con, depending on your outlook), some construction going on pretty much all day (not really too bad though).I thought the staff was very helpful (though beware that almost everyone will offer services of a tour guide or driver). The oceanside cooking class was worth the money (the food is good, and it's a fun, no stress activity). I would skip the trip to the Denpasar market, unless you enjoy being bombarded by people wanting you to buy something. It was dirty, and a little too stressful for a vacation activity. (the market).There is no lifeguard on duty at the pool, and it is not a kid-friendly pool (the depth of the pool is very deep... and not much of a shallow end). It's perfect for adults - I loved hanging out by the pool bar - there was a nice selection of non-alcoholic drinks as well as typical tropical beverages.My room was very clean, and there weren't really any bugs or lizards (surprisingly) in the room. (not that I saw...lol) The a/c worked fine, but I'm not sure when the air filter was cleaned out last. It had a bit of a musty smell, but not too bad.The sunset was gorgeous - you can check it out at the hotel, or take a quick taxi ride to KuDeTa... if you want to spend a bit on dinner and hang out at a very nice place. I didn't eat any meal at the hotel except breakfast and the meal served with the cooking class. The restaurant had an extensive menu - but we went in slow season, so we never saw anyone eating there except for the breakfast.I would recommend this hotel - and would stay there again. The price was just over $100 for our room (US$) That is cheap for us -- not sure how it compares to other beachside hotels.Take bug spray for sitting outside (small biting insects near the pool...and all over bali :) Also - sunscreen is important!", "Date": "Apr 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR239823696", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "TwiceInALifetime"}, {"Content": "Good experience, but...

Decided to try something new for my second visit to Bali and to meet my future Bride. Had a hotel broker give us the room # (sorry won't divulge!) and we had a room and experience for the ages. Like to swim in the surf? Watch out for the undertoe, but if you don't there is a manned guard tower. GREAT (and cheap) seafood restaurants along the beach. What you don't get is crowds and the tourist hoopla - but taxi's are so darn cheap, so enjoy going to Denpasar or Kuta/legian/Tuban/Jimbaran for shopping/special dining. The staff was spectacular. We are in the process of booking another trip to Bali, but am shocked by either new owners or greed factor. We paid 32.00usd net per night.

We chose a junior suite room (USD $78 per night) which was fully outfitted with TV, IDD telephone, large bed, extra-large and luxurious bathroom, work area, mini bar, in-room safe, AC, and balcony overlooking the beach. The hotel's many features include a giftshop, business center, 24 hour room service, full service restaurant, in-room massage, large swimming pool with swim up bar, free shuttle service to the nearby villages and beaches, and a tour booking service. Grand Balsani Suites also has a semi-private beach which is clean and enjoyable but swimming is not recommended due to rip tides and dangerous currents. Unfortunately the beach is also a gathering point for the island's ever-present and persistent vendors. The restaurant features a modest breakfast buffet and a comprehensive lunch and dinner menu with an impressive wine list.Overall the Grand Balisani Suites is a great deal for the price.
