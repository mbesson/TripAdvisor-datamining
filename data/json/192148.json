Looks are really deceiving - from the outside it looks like it would be really fancy, but no way! It's a very dreary hotel that really needs a makeover. Positive - staff was really nice. They had a library at the front desk and I was able to borrow a travel london book. Very nice of them Super good location only for the subway. Really close to Earls Court station. 5- 10 mins on that and you are in the center of things. London is a really expensive city to find a place, but there has got to be a better place than this hotel.

I cant believe its called a hotel it was more like staying at a hostel.....! The best thing was the location like other people say its ideal for going in and out for your sightseeing trips.Earls court tube is 2mins away,and all you have to purchase is a zone 1-2 oyster card for the transport. The bad things..... 1.loose tiles on bathroom floor 2.Lights not working plus Dangerous. 3.Bedroom Carpet/Hotel Carpet Dirty...Bedroom didnt appear to get vacuumed. 4.Toilet space and shower space very small,if you are of larger build you will have no chance of sitting down on the toilet. 5.Breakfast very basic,toast always undercooked.Warm Bread!!! 6.Handrails leading up to the hotel entrance very insecure. How this Hostel/Hotel Passes the Health and Safety Checks required is beyond belief........ We only spent 1 hour a day maximum in the room to get changed thank god for that.

It was planned in a hurry this trip and I trusted the booking company when they oferred us this 4 stars hotel (this is the category of the hotel on our booking mail). Seeing the other comments, I alredy consider myself a lucky traveler as I didn't have problems with the shower and the room wasn't in the basement! But still, this was the tiniest room I have ever been with the perfect match in the shower. There were max 30 cm between the bed and the front wall and of course, to take advantage of all space, they had to place the tea cup's support on the same wall. In order to pass sideways and also hunchbacked through that area. Yes, the sheets were clean, but I took a look before leaving under the bed and I was horrified to see rests of food, wrapping of candies and the dust floating like they didn't passed the vacuum cleaner for 2 months at least! Anyway, disgusting to see that after spending 3 nights in that room. We also had the fire alarm on Sun morning at 6 am and when we asked at the reception what was that they said it's normal to test it from time to time! Breakfast was very simple: coffee, milk, cereals and toast. It's good that is close to bus station streight to Marble Arch and metro. Overall, I wouldn't repeat the experience. I should have imagined why their website is so cheap and they don't have any photos of the rooms.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex", "Title": "\u201cthe pits!\u201d", "Author": "bean184", "ReviewID": "UR8864545", "Content": "The bathroom was tiny, too small to swing a cat! had to turn sideways to get in to the shower as the toilet was blocking the door from opening fully.

The breakfast staff/cleaning staff was much more polite. Breakfast was toast cereal, juice, and fruit cocktail from a can with tea. Internet access was great if you have wireless they give you the password and you can us it in the dining room.

You may also see the sink, which is again the smallest sink I have ever seen in a hotel room. I could not wash my hands, since they did not fit under the tap. Please pay attention to the worn out hair dryer, which I hesitated for a while before handling, since it looked very dirty and dangerous. The room itself was small and worn out, except the bedsheets, sheets were ok. The worst part is yet to come. On the second night I woke up with the fire alarm at 4 a.m., which happened to be a false alarm! We all get out of our rooms, and sent back by the staff saying it went out by mistake. After some sleepless hours, I woke up with a false fire alarm again at 7:30 a.m.!!!

The hotel lived up to my expectations, which as you can see in the comments below, there isnt too much to expect. Honestly though, the hotel room was fine. It was small, it was in the basement, BUT we had windows which also let in natural light from the street. One warning though, there is NO airconditioning, so I wouldnt recommend staying there in the summer heat. They provide FREE wireless internet for some floors. I beleive it is in the lobby, and you can get it below in the basement. I doubt you would get it on maybe level 2, but you can always take your laptop to the lobby. The rooms look like they have been renovated and modernised. Its a shame they forgot to renovate the bathrooms at the same time. The chick they have on the front desk is useless. No customer service skills whatsoever. The luggage ticket system is fine, if they enforced it. When you drop your luggage off for storage, they leave it in the lobby, attach a ticket to the bag, and give you the corresponding ticket number. When you arrive back, theoretically speaking, you should have to give the ticket back to get your bag. Nup not here, just walk on it and take it. The guy running the show with the Corgie, he is helpful, can book tours around london for you and provide tourism information. About the bathroom, the people below are NOT exaggerating. The room is tiny. The room we had, the toilet was squashed in a corner, that no person over 100kg could possibly get into. The room we had, had a bad case of wood rot around the bathroom door. Due to the shower recess being so small, the water ends up on the floor outside the bathroom, which is carpet over timber. There was one spot where my foot could go through the floor. There is one upside to the bathroom, the shower head was above my head (I am 185cm tall) and the water pressure was fantastic. Overall I would recommend, but dont expect too much.
