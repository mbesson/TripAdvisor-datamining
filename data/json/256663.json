I would say it rated 3.5 stars not quiet 4 though. Check in was fine (though the attendant made the credit card pre-authorisation for the room charges hard to understand). The room was a standard room on the 12th floor. It was quiet, but you can hear others in the corridor if they are banging cases or doors. Otherwise I barely hear a thing. The room was a good size, with decent size bathroom and nice fluffy towels. Wish they would get rid of the shower curtains and install proper glass shower doors. Plenty of pressure and hot water. The bed was a little tired and saggy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but slept fine on it. Decor is very plain with cheap, functional furniture. The bedspread was faded could have done with replacing. But to me these are superficial and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect the quality of my stay. Location wise, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best part of town \u00e2\u20ac\u201c close to the CBD with a short walk to Elizabeth St or through Hyde park, a few blocks from Central station, and short walks to either Surrey Hills or Elizabeth Bay (and of course Darlinghurst if you want some night life). Museum station is only a block away too. It may not be flash, but I think Travelodge represents value for money, with many Sydney hotels charging over $200 per night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I got a much cheaper deal.

I am just Asian and pretty \"compact\" in size, it can be imagined that if any stronger man and woman living there would be even worse. The air-conditioner is sort of not very effective and controllable. After all, I would recommend to all of you reading this comment if you are just looking for a roof to stay for the night, it is a fair and economic choice in Sydney. However if you are looking for a little bit more comfortable room, go somewhere else. One thing to add, if you are driving, you may considered parking on the street next to the Hotel, as it is free to park after dark. In considered that the Police Station is just next door, I parked there for 3 nights and no problem encountered at all.

They have a breakfast which is very no frills but OK. This hotel seems to be very popular with tour groups so get in early! Also allow time for check out if catching a flight in case you try and check out at the same time as a tour group. Wi-Fi was available in the rooms for a cost of $20 for 24hrs and was fast.

However, this was not really an issue for me, as I like to have breakfast out when I'm on holiday; others may want to consider this though. There were 4 coin-op. internet kiosks which generally worked well, and the costs were not too bad for a quick email check.

In addition, there was a self-service laundry which was operational each day, and vending machines/ice machines were foundon each level. All of this was very useful.

At over 6 foot 6 tall I pointed out that this wasn't going to be comfortable but were told that the hotel was full and room allocations had been made 2 weeks before and were now \"locked - no changes possible\". The young woman on check-in immediately offered to call her Manager (I gained the impression that she had been having to deal with this all day and had already had enough !). The Manager gave us the same answer. We produced the original paperwork indicating that we had most definitely booked double rooms. The answer to this was \"you booked through a third party site (they said Expedia but it was Hotels.com) and it's in the small print that you are just guaranteed a room ... not a particular type\". I asked how they made the decision on who got the doubles and who didn't .... I would have thought that paying in full in March would have given us priority. She had no answer to this other than \"you are welcome to find another hotel and I will refund your booking\". At any other time I would have said yes but it would have been impossible to find an alternative in Sydney for NYE. So travellers beware .... unless you book direct with the hotel your room type is not guaranteed. The hotel itself is 3 star at best .... definitely not 4.

Another strange thing about this place is the elevator system. The fact that you have to swipe your key card to go up is probably for security, but if you are in the elevator and don't swipe the card in time and the elevator is called from an upper floor, up you go to that floor anyway. How is that secure? If you get in the elevator to go down and someone on an upper floor calls the elevator in the seconds before you push the button for the lobby floor, up you go.

The bed wasn't very comfy, but the room stayed very dark which was great for sleeping. The washroom was very small and poorly planned - no enclosure for the shower and a kiddie-cornered toilet behind the heavy door meant dark, slippery, hazard-filled nighttime washroom visits. Always plan lots of time to leave your room in this hotel - the elevators are INCREDIBLY SLOW, and even though we were halfway up (9th floor), we often had two or three elevators pass by which were completely full before we could squeeze into one (15 minutes or so). This happened each morning of the 4 nights we spent (between 7am-10am). Breakfast was okay, but I asked how much it would be if we didn't have the vouchers. I was shocked that the buffet is $19 per person. It's a very basic breakfast layout (for those from North America, anyway) with runny eggs and terrible coffee. If breakfast isn't included, save yourself the money and go up to one of the many cafes in the area (within 2 blocks). You'll get a better price for better food. Location is pretty decent - less than five minutes' walk to World Square, and same to Museum Station. It's a bit of a hike to Circular Quay (20 minutes or so), but if you follow Pitt Street, you can walk through the mall and there's plenty to see along the way. While the service was a little disappointing (we often had to wait at an unattended counter before we could enter the breakfast area), I was most frustrated that none of my wakeup calls worked. I checked after the first missed one, and the agent simply said they would ensure my future wakeup calls would be set. When I was checking out, I explained my situation, and this time the agent checked to make sure they were all logged correctly and explained my phone was probably switched off. It would have been helpful if the first person had suggested that, so that we wouldn't have been late and then extra-frustrated waiting for the elevator. Overall, a decent and clean hotel.

The kitchenette had a fridge, toaster and kettle and every utensil you could need (have been stuck without can openers in other hotels!!). The room was cleaned daily and always to a high standard. In terms of location it was quite good. It was minutes away from Hyde Park and maybe a 30 minute walk to Circular Quay and Darling Harbour (always more fun on the way there than back!). The girls at the desk gave us a map and easy to follow directions to World Square where there is a supermarket. We also checked in a couple of hours early, and while our room wasn't ready, we were able to store our luggage for free. My only two gripes with the place have to do with pre-payment and checking out. When we checked in we were told that we had to pre-pay for our room. This was news to us (it wasn't on the Ts and Cs of our booking sheet) and really inconvenient as one of us were being paid later on during the week and counted on using that money to pay. The girl at reception told us we could use our Visa debit card and that would hold the money but not take it out. She shouldn't really be dishing out banking advice as she was wrong - the full amount (plus a credit card surcharge fee) was taken out and could have potentially left us in the lurch! If a place requires pre-payment they should really advertise it! The second gripe involves checking out - this took far too long. Considering their policy of pre-payment I can't really understand why the two/three girls on the front desk were taking so long! We nearly missed our airport shuttle!

Costs in Sydney are pretty high compared to USA prices -- Breakfasts are typically $18 - $25, and a lunch of hamburger and chips with drink can cost you $25 or more. The mircowave and mini-kitchen at Travelodge can cut your dining costs considerably. Transportation: Even though there are a lot of recommendations to buy the MyMultiPass tickets that give you travel on subway, bus, and ferry, we came out ahead by buying individual tickets as needed. By the way, the monorail is not part of the MultiPass package since monorail is privately owned. Here are the transportation prices we found in Mar 2011: 1. Monorail - $4.50 per person one way or $9.50 all day use - check the map you can get at your hotel or at the monorail station for the location of stops on this limited circular route. 2. Train - from the central train station to Blue Mountains (Katumba) we paid $11.50 round trip. In Katumba we walked to Echo Point to view the gorge and 3-sisters and caught the local trolly back to the train station in town for 2 bucks per person. So, we saved a lot of money compared to what the bus companies charge for this trip from Sydney to Blue Mountains ... compare our total of $13.50 each to the tour company prices. All of this was very easy and knowledgable people guided us along the way -- hotel desk, train station ticket agent, people on the train and train platform, and folks in Katumba. Risk was insignificant with the frequency of the train, etc. 3. Ferry - Trip to Manly Beach was only $13 each (approx). Even if you're not interested in the beach itself, you'll find the trip to the quaint beach town and the ferry ride worthwhile. 4. Airport Shuttle - $14 each from hotel -- probably can save a little by booking on line (maybe get price of $12). The train might be less but then you have to deal with dragging your luggage aboard and then getting from the train terminal to your flight terminal. If you're using the shuttle from airport to your hotel, be sure you ask inside the air terminal where to meet the shuttle. Ask two or more people to make sure you have it right. I only asked once and wound up waiting in the wrong place for over 30 minutes while the shuttle driver was looking for me at the blue wall named \"The Meeting Place.\" 5. Taxi - The taxi from the dock where cruise lines arrive to Travelodge was $15 - well worth it to avoid dragging the bags onto the bus and then a couple blocks to the hotel. Just ask the guys managing bus traffic where to grab the cab. 6. Free Bus - There's a free bus that circles downtown Sydney. Frequency can vary, but you get to see a lot of local culture while waiting. Just find the bus stop signs that show 555 and watch for the green color city busses. No ticket required - just get on and ride. Board at front door only and exit either by front or side door. 7. The MultiPass tickets were $20-46, depending on the level of access ... so do the math. What to see ... 1. Aquarium - nice aquarium, pretty much the same as you'll find in most major aquariums around the world 2. Wild Life - Next to aquarium on harbor - Fair ... does include kangaroos and kuala up close 3. Maritime Museum ... very nice museum -- free with extra fee if you want to tour the ships 4. Paddy's Market - good Sydney experience, no entrance fee 5. Blue Mountains - nice train ride to Katumba, nice view of the mountains - similar to what you'll find in the USA Blue Ridge Mountains and Appalachian Mountains 6. Ferry Port ... be sure to allow time to see the street performers around the harbor where the ferries come in ... catch the 555 bus to and from the port 7. Victoria Station - central shopping area, very nice up scale mall in CBD ... ride the 555", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cValue-for-money, friendly service, totally enjoyable!\u201d", "Author": "msb00ty", "ReviewID": "UR101870059", "Content": "This is a value-for-money with friendly service.

First of all I tried to look for a reasonable hotel with great location, breakfast and free wi-fi. From their home page I understood that breakfast was included and that they had internet in the lobby. I booked and enquired about the breakfast and they told us that breakfast was included. When we went for the breakfast, the lady there told us that one coupon is for 1 so we had only two coupons which meant that our room included only 1 free breakfast even though I booked it for two. They didn't tell us this in the reception so I was quite baffled. We only got the coupons as we checked in and they didn't even ask if we would like to buy breakfast for the other person. I have never been in a hotel which would offer free breakfast for only one person, when there is two staying. So we had one breakfast for two and the second morning we ate somewhere else. Also we learned that they had internet but it was chargeable and only in the lobby. We asked from the reception if they could tell us if there is a cafe which would have free wi-fi so that we could use our own laptop. They told us to go to a cafe nearby and we went there but they didn't have wi-fi and never even had one. They told us that there were plenty of places where you could use free wi-fi like around the Circular Quay. Other thing that bothered me was that when we checked in after an early flight they didn't take our phone number to give us a call if/when a room would have been ready. I mean we were quite tired after a long flight so I would have appreciated it a lot if they would have given us a bit of consideration and shown us that they are doing their best. I do understand if there is not any availability in the morning but little consideration would be nice when you have to wait for a room from 7 am till 2 pm. When cheking out we asked if they could call us a cab and they told us to go outside and wave. I was pretty surprised they didn't do that for us as they do it in many other hotels but luckily we didn't have to wait for long as it was early in the morning so there wasn't hardly any traffic and the cab seemed to be mostly free. First it just seemed a bit desperate. Otherwise the location was great, in walking distance to many attractions. During our stay there was also a free bus connection around the centre so that was very convenient. Our room was clean and big with small kitchenette and it was also quiet, couldn't hear any noises from the streets nor from the corridors.

Our room was ready at 1pm and as we had been up all night with flights we were very grateful to get into a room but the second room wasn't ready and when we went in at 2pm the odour removing machine was still on but quickly removed by staff as we arrived. I complained about the smell at Reception and they arranged for the machine to be placed in the room during the evening whilst we were out. The smell was quite bad the next day so again mentioned it at Reception and they said the odouriser would be placed in the room whilst my daughters were out. (not sure if this happened or not). I felt we were penalized as we are non-smokers and having to put up with someone's blatant lack of understanding of the hotel rules regarding smoking in rooms. I felt that the smell would improve but it didn't over the two days and in future I would refuse a room with this type of smell.

We booked through email to the hotel about 5 months prior. As our flight arrived at night, we informed the hotel beforehand that we would check in late and got confirmation on the number of persons staying in the room and the bed and sofa bed. When we reached the hotel and showed our reservation confirmation letter, we were promptly given a room on the highest floor with queen bed and a sofa bed. The room was not next to the lifts and it was high above the streets, so there was no sound disturbance during our stay. The room was small but this is understandable because it is a budget hotel and is centrally located. We did not find the room size to be a hindrance. We arranged the furniture to utilize space effectively such as moving the coffee table to the wall and place our luggage bags underneath and on top of the table, and to fold up the sofa bed during the day time. The sofa bed was handy and we did not find it to be too uncomfortable for sleeping. The main bed was average. The room has a wash basin and microwave oven for meal preparation. This was most useful for us as we would buy food and fruits and prepare our daily breakfast there. There was also the daily coffee and tea bags which we could have a cup of coffee during breakfast, afternoon breaks or even late night fix. The toilet was well planned to utilize the limited space well. Though there was no shower door, a bath curtain prevented water from the shower area to wet up the whole toilet. The toilet was equipped with a hair dryer too. There was hot and cold water but the hot water was not as consistent as we would like it to be. Many a time, the hot water dropped off leaving us too cold or came on stronger making us jumping out of the water. The hotel is about 8 minutes walk to the Museum train station, 15 minutes walk to the nearest Coles in World Trade Tower where we bought a lot of grocery, and 25 minutes walk to Chinatown. There is also a bus station on Liverpool street about 5 minutes from the hotel. The much talked about slope to the hotel is the slope up from the hotel entrance along Commonweath Street and the slope up along Liverpool Street to Museum station and a steep slope down Liverpool Street until the Central Business District. We walked the slopes many times but we did not pull any luggage bags with us so I am not sure if it was a problem with the luggage bags especially along Commonwealth Street. But there is an alternative path with less slope up to get to the Museum station that is to walk along Goulbourn Street. The slopes and because of the empty space at the nearby Hyde Park, there was always a strong cold wind to greet us when we did the slopes going to and fro the hotel. On the day we left, we checked out early before 10 am like the hotel required us and left our luggage with the hotel as our flight was late at night. There were ample taxis outside the hotel which we took to and fro the airport. The taxi fare was around A$30 one way. We did not take the airport shuttle bus (which cost A$12 per person (same price for adult and children) because the service finished by 8 pm and we could only exit the airport after that time on arrival. We did not take the train (which cost A$15 per person) because we did not want to walk the slopes with our luggage. Anyway, as there were 4 of us, it was cheaper for us to use the taxi. Food wise, we could walk to the CBD where the restaurants open until mid night and to Chinatown where economical food is available. The crowded lobby area for checking in and out did not turn into a problem for us during our stay. In conclusion, the hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to many places like mentioned above.

I think it was about US$70. For the price I was paying, of course I wasn't sure of what to expect. I know Travelodge in the US are more of motels and inns, but from the picture here it seemed like a big hotel. I didn't expect a 5 star hotel, but the hotel exceeded my expectations. I enjoyed my stay very much. Its not in the city center, but if you don't mind walking a few blocks, you'll get to the places where the shopping is easily , or you can take a taxi for a few dollars or the bus. The room was surprisingly big. We had 2 single beds, and there was a sofa with a coffee table too. The bathroom was a bit small, but decent enough. The only complain I have is when you take a shower, the water is everywhere in the bathroom, cause its just one level. There is no step or breaker from the shower to the rest of the bathroom. That was about the only problem. The room also had a microwave, a fridge, sink and kettle. So my sister loved that cause her daughter is very picky with food, so she got to heat up the food she brought for her. The hotel only has a breakfast area, but we didn't have breakfast there. My sister did, but she didn't like it. There is a coffee shop right across the hotel near the 24 hour mini mart where we would have our breakfast for less. They had a good selection of breakfast items, pancakes, sandwiches, yogurt, fruits. All kinds of things for a few dollars. And good coffee. There is no other restaurant in the hotel except the breakfast, so if you come back after a day of shopping without having dinner yet, make sure you grab some take out because it'll be hard to find food around the area at night. The coffee shop we go to closes at 5pm I think. There is a bar across the street, but we didn't go there.

But the keys would not work so you would end up riding the elevator for 15 minutes before either going to check your card or taking the stairs.

Honestly, I was beginning to worry that we would not be able to find an affordable place to stay in Sydney. We booked directly from the hotel website--if you stay more than 3 days, you get a 30% discount. Just be VERY careful with your dates--you have to pre-pay and if you make a mistake (like I did) the hotel is reluctant to alter your booking. It all worked out and I was refunded the extra night when we checked in. This is a big hotel and very busy. When we arrived (about 10:30am) there was a line of people registering. No way to check in before 2pm. Very full luggage storage room. Our room was clean and on a high floor (17). Rooms have refrigerators, kettles, bowls, plates, glasses & silverware. It all seemed fine until I took off the pillowcases and got a look at the nasty, yellow pillows. I called and insisted on new pillows--really glad I did that. I agree with other posts that there is a lot of noise from the hallway & rooms next door. Luckily, we were near the end of a hall, so it wasn't too much of an issue. But, I would be wary of a room near the lift/elevator. Reception has lockboxes which are free to use and handy. The hotel charges a lot for little incidentals: laundry $4 washer/$4 dryer/$4 detergent, internet $6 hour. We never ate at the hotel. There are a lot of interesting restaurants & shops on nearby Oxford Street including 2 supermarkets where we picked up stuff for breakfast. The hotel is very convenient to public transportation--the Museum Station is only 2 blocks away and many buses go up/down nearby Elizabeth Street. We bought a weekly pass to the buses/trains/ferries for $41--best $$ we ever spent! As far as getting to/from the airport--I would recommend the Airport Shuttle. $24 for a round-trip ticket. As mentioned previously, there are a lot of steps at the rail stations and I certainly did not want to lug my luggage! Overall, I thought this was a good place to stay. Although, it was frustrating to be checking out with the airport shuttle waiting only to be told that we had watched three moves--2 of them 'adult.' WHAT??? I protested my innocence and finally left, but I am keeping an eye on my credit card bill to be sure no extra charges show up. Suggestions for Oxford Street & nearby: -Betty's Soup Kitchen ($10 soup & salad bar) -Iku (organic, vegetarian food) -Thai Me Up! (best Thai food I've had in a while, but I AM from NZ!) -Mad Mex (chain Mexican food, but cheap and delicious--on side street) -Priceline Pharmacy (VERY helpful chemist) -The Falconer--we didn't get a chance to eat here ourselves, but it has raves on Sydney dining sites.

We wanted to spend less on accommodation and more on sight-seeing, so we decided to go for budget accommodation. We wanted somewhere affordable and simple, but still private and clean. We were worried about what we would get for the price we paid, so we booked 3 nights in the Travelodge, then 3 nights in a backpackers just in case one was bad. We were sorry we moved to the backpackers, because for the difference in price, the Travelodge was so much nicer. Such value for money, clean, quiet, and central without being in a dodgy area or around \"backpacker\" type people. Rooms were great! Kitchenette had a microwave, fridge, kettle, and sink - with cutlery and crockery, and coffee, tea and sugar, as well as a little carton of milk (everything gets topped up everyday and you can just call reception from your room to ask for more if you need). Room has a plasma screen tv, iron and ironing board. Bathroom was old style, but clean, with towels, hairdryer, soaps and shampoos. Room is serviced everyday, they even wash your dishes for you. There is a laundry and vending machines on certain floors, and internet access in the lobby. Security is great, you have to swipe your card to operate the lift to get to your floor. You hardly even notice any other people around you because the rooms are so quiet. It is immaculately clean, the staff are well-presented and helpful. We got a great rate through expedia.com.au, however the only problem with Expedia is that the room you have requested is not guaranteed. So we were given a room with two single beds instead of the queen bed which we had booked. It was not the end of the world though - definitely book through expedia.com.au to get a good rate, but perhaps just phone a fews days before you arrive to ask if they can confirm you will get the bed you asked for and make sure you check-in as early as they allow so you get first choice. We were so disappointed to have to leave the Travelodge, but could not stay longer because they were fully booked. Will not stay anywhere else in Sydney next time we visit.

We never had it so cant comment. The hotel seems to be frequented by backpackers and students, dont let this put you off though, it isnt a dump by any means.

Rooms have a 32\" LCD TV which has the usual TV channels, Free FOXTel sport channels and payTV Movies. The bed we had was a queen (UK King) and was quite comfortable, although the pillows came in 2 sizes: Thin or Huge! Plenty of lighting options and good blockout curtains, we thought it was still nightime at 9.30am, the room was pitch dark. The bathroom is very small, but the shower is great with hot water and good pressure at all times, toilet OK, and sink OK with a large mirror. The only problem we had was that out extractor fan in the bathroom didnt work, so it was very steamy which the wife moaned about because she couldnt see to put on her makeup! Location is good, only a 10 minute walk to George St, 3 minute walk to Museum railway station which is a direct link to the airport ($15 pp each way- train every 10mins with a 12 min journey to the airport). The hotel does offer a $12 airport shuttle, but the journey takes an hour with lots of stops, so we found the train a quicker option. Make sure you take comfortable shoes, i took some new ones and my feet were crippled after a couple of days with al the walking (we did lots).

We booked on the internet on a Tuesday and got free breakfast for one person each day. We were given vouchers for this so ended up with free breakfasts for the 2 of us on 2 days of our stay.

It's a street over from Elizabeth Street too so you don't have to walk far to get on the 555 shuttle around the city. We had a room on level 12, and there's 18 floors in total, so we were fairly high above street level and so noise wasn't an issue; you do hear a bit of noise in the corridors but there wasn't many people on my floor so it wasn't a problem for us (although if the hotel was full I think it would be noisy). What I liked was the fact that it comes with all the basic amenities if you want to make your own meals in the room - microwave, bar fridge, cutlery and crockery etc. If you're travelling on a budget this is so much more convenient than a hotel that simply has a restaurant. A toaster would have been really useful but I guess for fire alarm reasons they've chosen not to. It's clean, the bathroom is a decent size, and you get a desk and sofa which is handy for extra guests or if you've got work to do and want to spread out in the room. The staff are pretty good on the whole, and better than staff in some of the more upmarket hotels I've stayed in! Another great plus is the luggage storage facility - you just leave your bags and collect them when you're ready. It allowed us to go and do a few things and then get our bags when we wanted - no having to collect the bags by a certain time like other places. The only real negative was that the beds are as hard as a rock! I was so tired from all the travelling I'd done that I slept anyway but my family members really did not appreciate the hard beds. More comfortable beds are definitely needed. A couple of other minor complaints - the iron wasn't terribly good; didn't iron the clothes too well and looked like it needed replacing. One final gripe I had was the cost of laundry - $4 to wash, $4 to use the dryer. I thought this was ridiculous and so I didn't bother using the hotel's laundry facilities. Overall I'd recommend this hotel and I'd stay there again.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood , quite ,affordable base in Sydney.\u201d", "Author": "highpointUK", "ReviewID": "UR62361905", "Content": "We found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful.

It worked out well. We found both the staff and the facilities of this Travelodge noticeably better than those at the Travelodge, Wynyard (which has the advantage of a more central city location and the attendant convenience to tourist attractions towards Circular Quay). If you intend using public transport extensively for sightseeing, before you leave Sydney airport find out details about the various types and durations of TravelPass. We found the information counter at the end of the arrivals concourse often had a long queue. If you go downstairs where you buy train tickets, you can also obtain information from posters and from the ticket sellers. We found our TravelPass very useful, as it gave us unlimited access to regular trains, buses and ferries which covered everywhere that we wanted to go and saved us money in the process. Note that travelling to and from the airport terminals involved special fares (expensive given the short distances). Museum station and the Liverpool street exit are closest to the hotel; however, be prepared to lug your bags from the train platform to street level up several flights of stairs. There is no lift-elevator or escalators at this end. To walk to the hotel from the station (about 5-10 minutes), cross to the other side of Liverpool Street and walk up it with Hyde Park on your left, turn right at Commonwealth Street and walk down the slope. The hotel will be to your right at the confluence of Commonwealth, Goulburn and Wentworth streets. There is a ramp for wheeling up your bags. All the staff we dealt with at reception were especially pleasant, helpful, cooperative and obliging. If you would like a view, try for a room on floors 16 to 18. Quieter rooms are at the end of the corridor away from the lifts-elevators. Some floors have ice and vending machines, so avoid a room in the vicinity. Our room had a bar refrigerator, microwave oven and basic utensils for having simple meals in the room. (There was a Coles supermarket open till midnight in World Square at the corner of Liverpool and George streets.) Avoid convenience stores if you can; they overcharge \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as everywhere.) The windows had single glazing, but we were high up so the noise of traffic and sirens did not bother us. The hotel lounge has a caf\u00c3\u00a9 (closed when we were there) and, opposite, several computers providing Internet access based on payment for time used. A good place to eat in Chinatown is in an inconspicuous food court at the top-left of Dixon street (lined with restaurants and touts). It has numerous counters with a range of vendors serving various Asian cuisines, freshly cooked at very reasonable prices. You can eat there for several days and always have something quite different.

As such it turned out to be a good choice for us, with recently updated interior and smallish but clean, quiet rooms which included microwave and small refrigerator. The hotel apparently caters to tour groups and short-stay tourists like us and the compact lobby area gets crowded at check in / check out time, but the front desk is well-staffed and they move things along nicely. If you arrive before rooms are available (common, as many international flights reach Sydney in the morning hours) they have a free baggage-check room to store your stuff while you explore downtown Sydney. Although they provide all the essentials, this is a fairly low-frills hotel. Internet access is available in the lobby for a charge via coin-operated terminals at $2AU for 20 minutes or Wi-Fi at $11.50AU for a 24 hour period but with a log-on time limit. No exercise facility, pool, etc. There is a dining facility serving full breakfast but closed thereafter. Breakfast may or may not be included and we got it on our first stay but not on the second, which I found confusing particularly since our first stay was at a 20% cheaper special rate, a situation for which no explanation was forthcoming. They do offer discounted breakfast vouchers but only if you purchase at check-in. There are many places to dine in the immediate vicinity; we had a nice dinner at the small & funky McQuarie hotel & pub directly across the street. Dining, BTW, is pricy in Australia, so be prepared. In terms of getting around, the hotel is located just a block outside the central business loop along which you can hop onto any of Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent bus routes. Particularly useful for exploring the downtown area is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153555 line\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, green buses which are free to ride and continually circle the central business loop in both directions. Also a short walk away is the Museum Railway Station, a stop for the train connecting downtown with the Sydney Airport, and if you are light on bags this is about the cheapest way to get to & from the airport. For the more conventionally bag-loaded tourist the second choice is an airport shuttle, with the most expensive (but most convenient) option being via taxi, which will run about $50AU to/from the hotel.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cabsolutely nothing to complain about-great value\u201d", "Author": "goworldmtl", "ReviewID": "UR60780977", "Content": "The location is great, you can walk anywhere.

When booking accomodation we always ask ourselves what are we going for? and how long are we likely to stay in the hotel?. On this occassion we had all day/evening activities planned and were looking for a comfortable bed in a well located hotel that represented value with a large booking. We are not tight budget travellers by any means and stay in hotels of varying standards depending on commonsense needs. Travelodge Sydney ticked all the boxes and we were more than happy with our choice The rooms were a good standard size, very clean and no one in our party had any complaint about the comfort of the beds. The aircon system was a little noisy/rattly in our room but otherwise worked well making the room pleasantly comfortable despite the extreme heat outside on this visit. (We sorted it by adjusting the fan speed) Sound insulation was no problem and the only noise during the night was from the usual rowdy guests in the hallways returning from a night out. This is a \"hotel hazard\" no matter where you stay and was accepted. The curtains do a great job of blocking out the light and helped add to a good night's sleep. Bathroom was fine. Yes, as mentioned by others, the shower is more like a slightly recessed area set into the floor and if you are big on water volume then the bathroom floor does become wet. On the flipside, I guess this arrangement is designed to assist guests with limited mobility to get into the shower. Hot water was no issue on the 11th floor during this visit. The room has a microwave and small fridge. Drinks and snacks etc are obtained from vending machines in the hallway. For our way of thinking, a far better option than an expensive mini bar rip off. The front desk service was excellent for us. Speedy and friendly check in and out. Breakfast was included in our rate (which was a great price for a Sydney hotel). Quality of the food and service in the dining room was very good. Overnight car parking was no great inconvenience as it was only a short block away. There is ample hassle-free kerbside parking in the street alongside the front of the hotel which is appreciated when dropping off/loading luggage etc. The hotel is very well located. A short walk to to the inner city features and a short stroll from Museum Rail Station. Importantly for us, it was an easy walk to Central to catch buses to the SCG To sum up. Typical Travelodge. Doesn't pretend to be 4 or 5 Star and doesn't charge like some hotels in Sydney who pretend they are of a higher standard. If you are a really discerning and demanding traveller who expects the very best then simply don't stay here. It's not what you're after. If you are looking for decent, comfortable and good value accomodation then Travelodge Sydney is recomended.

Chinatown is close by for places to eat. We hadn't booked direct with Travelodge and booked through another website, so when we checked in they said they couldn't give us a double room as our boooking was only a 'request' rather than a reservation.

We had flown in on an overnight flight (like most flights) but had to wait about 3 hours until 11.30am to check in. We sat in Hyde Park for a while which was nice. We were lucky to be 'upgraded' to a triple room - we had booked twin beds and a sofa bed but ended up in a triple which was great as we only paid \u00c2\u00a341 per night (no breakfast). Room was basic but ok. Beds were on castors so had a habit of moving when you sat down on them. Bathroom was essentially a wet area with no separate shower cubicle and even though there was a curtain, the floor continually flooded. Handy kitchenette for reheating food and making drinks. Ice cube machine and laundry was on our floor. Tips: Sydney is very expensive for food - the City Convenience shops are extortionately priced. 7-11 is not cheap either. We shopped for food basics at Woolworths supermarket - downstairs at Town Hall station and Coles supermarket (World Square). We got takeaway pasta from a shop on the corner of Elizabeth Street/Hyde Park - that was handy as we could eat in the room and microwave the leftovers! There is a free bus (the 555 I think) which goes in a circular route down to Circular Quay. The nearest stop is on Elizabeth St at the front of the old Mark Foy dept. store. Again, can recommend this if you are travelling with young children. Another tip - if you are in Sydney on a Sunday, there is a Family Funday Travel Ticket for A$2.50 per person for families travelling on buses/trains/ferries. This is great value.

The hotel is also close walking distance to Paddy's market where you can buy lots of gifts for a margin of the price you'll find anywhere else from there walk towards Darling Harbor which is beautiful during the day and at night. Two places I recommend there are the Chinese Garden of Friendship ($6) to get in it's beautiful and calming - beware of the wondering lizard (so harmless - just don't step on them) also stay and have tea and lunch (I recommend the snack sampler) about $12. I also recommend the wildlife park but you have to go early 9am and go straight to the Koala center because at 9:30am you can start taking pictures with the Koalas $20 for 1 and $10 for each additional (if you plan on going to Featherdale Park you can take pictures for free). Ok, back to the hotel.

Other than that we didn't have any issues. The kitchenette was a nice touch too. We were able to save a lot of money by keeping leftovers and buying some snacks at the stores in town. The hotel is also in a nice location, easy walk from the Museum station. When you arrive, book the shuttle service back to the airport, it is cheaper than paying the station fee from the subway and it is nice to have door to door service.

I would recommend this hotel for people that realize they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not staying in a fabulous 5star quality hotel- they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at a relatively inexpensive (for Sydney) hotel that nicely provides a (very) small kitchenette, a pull-out sofabed, and a coffee table. They even provide a small container of milk in your fridge! I'm not sure what happened with other reviewers, but the room we stayed in was a standard queen and we not only had towels (that were replaced every day if you put them on the floor) but also a hand towel (but no washcloths) was in the bathroom as well as a bathmat towel. The bathmat towel came in handy because, as others have said, the shower doesn't have a splash guard at the bottom, but folding that towel in half saved the floor from getting too wet. Like I said, these (as well as the shampoo/cond & soap) were all replaced whenever we needed them to be, without us even asking. Oh, they also provide tissues and handy little plastic sanitary bags. As for the laundry, well, I didn't have any problems with it. The washer/dryer were located on 3 floors, and they required A$8 to do 1 load of laundry. Washer= A$2 coins x2, and dryer= A$2 coins x2 for a total of A$8. Laundry detergent is available as well for $2coin, and 1 pack is enough for 2 loads. If you don't have change you can get it from the reception/desk, they're very nice and always willing to give the necessary change. I thought at first that $8 was expensive for laundry, and while it is for where I live in the USA, it isn't actually expensive for Sydney. We checked out some laundromats on our journey around Sydney and they were all at least $8, so it was the same price as the hotel + we didn't have to go through the hassle of carrying it to the laundromat and wasting a day there, we just did it at night or early morning in the hotel. There were some negatives- the kitchen sink water smelled horrible, the hot water in the shower tended to surge, there were tiny fruit-fly-like bugs that came out of the shower, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a balcony and the windows don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open so you cannot have fresh air unless you go outside, and the bed was a little too firm for my liking (on nights when I could not stand the bed, I slept on the sofa part of the sofa-bed (I didn't unfold it to sleep) which was very comfy if you don't mind your feet being curled up or sticking over the edge). All that being said, I would go back to this hotel. I stayed for 26 nights, and the tiny incidents I mentioned above were made up for with the cleanliness (the cleaners were amazing fast & thorough, they even washed my dishes and dusted! If I didn't want housekeeping that day but required toilet paper, I just left a note on the door and requested them to leave TP, and they did. Very nice people.), hospitality (they immediately replaced a glass I broke & didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge me for it), safety (swipe card required for floor access), and location of this hotel. Tips: Buy a TravelPass for the length of your stay (1day, 3, or weekly) and then use it to take a train to the store (many stores are found at bigger train stations, ie Town Hall, Wynard, etc) to buy groceries, its MUCH cheaper than the convenience store. Also, make sure you go to Manly, they have the absolute BEST ice cream place called Royale Copenhagan.

So, if you're on a budget, it's good value as long as you're not expecting the Hyatt in disguise. But watch out for the convenience store right nearby - they charge like a wounded bull!

I read the reviews on here, and decided to book the travel lodge, because of its cheap price, and great location, being so near to the centre of Sydney. I was not disappointed. After reading the reviews on here, I telephoned and booked the hotel, and asked the booking staff for two things. 1st that my room was on one of the top floors, as they are in better condition, having recently been updated. 2nd that my room was well away from the lifts, as some people had complained that they heard a lot of noise, when they had rooms near to the lifts. When I arrived, I found the reception staff very young, but very nice and helpful. I was pleased to find that they had given me a room on the 18th floor, which was the top floor (normally these rooms are a little more expensive, but I was not charged extra), and also away from the lift. The room was very nice, and for the amount of money I paid, $105 bucks a night, for a hotel in the centre of a major city like Sydney, it was great value for money. The room was really clean, and very modern. It had air-conditioning that worked fine, a TV with limited channels, a modern bathroom, with everything working fine, including the hairdryer. Everyday, the room was cleaned, towels replaced, and impressively, all the sugar, tea bags, milk and coffee was replaced too. Just wished I never spent the money in the corner shop opposite the hotel, when I first arrived in Sydney, buying tea bags and milk which were expensive, (so avoid the late night grocery shop opposite the hotel, it was a rip off) The staff at the reception were as I said rather young, (teenagers mainly) but they were always very helpful, and polite to me. I tend to find people as they are, and if you are polite to them, they will be the same to you. I asked for a safe-deposit box, to put in my money and passport etc, and this was kept in the main office, and provided for free. So I never had to worry about my valuables being stolen or lost. Only one complaint, you get a swipe card, which you must use in the lifts (elevators) and to open the door of your room. Sometimes this card would not work first time, but did work after a few extra swipes. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why some people have written certain bad things about this Hotel, lets be honest you get what you pay for in life, and for the money this hotel cost for a night, you will not find better value in Sydney. One tip about eating out. I often used an Irish pub called Murphy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which is only minutes walk from the Hotel, and bought a pod of beer, and steak and chips, all for $12 bucks\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and enjoyed the friendly atmosphere that you find in an Irish pub\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6", "Date": "March 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood 3.5 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "sea2skyaus", "ReviewID": "UR26784283", "Content": "I had a good stay at the budget hotel.

Local phone calls from room were just 80c a go which I thought was cheap compared to the $14 I got stung for in a Gold Coast apartment, for one short mobile call.

The bed was simply pulled together, never properly made. We were having to make the bed when we come back to the room each evening. Behind the bathroom door, there was former occupants hair on the floor. We asked for a room with two beds for our daughters at time of booking but that was not provided. The room issue is not a major one and we could have had the girls room changed but that meant a different floor. We decided against that. I was happy about that decision as when we went to use the laundry facilities on another floor, the floor closest to us was filthy. The hallways carpets are stained and the walls dirty, very nasty! The laundry facilities are a joke as well. Besides being expensive at $4 for a wash and the same for a short dry cycle, we had to wash our clothes on one floor but use a dryer elsewhere because the dryer has gum all over the inside. Just one more example of the filth in this hotel. When the issues of lack of proper cleaning of the hotel are brought up with hotel staff, no one seemed to care about the issue I asked for the air conditioning to be looked at as the hallways and common areas are all MUCH cooler than our room. We came back to the hotel, turned on the A/C and were covered in dust blowing from the A/C vent. At least they looked at it, didn't fix it, but they looked at it. From the start we have had difficulty with Internet service. The hotel is happy to charge our account for Internet service, however they continually refer us to a third party vendor when the service does not work. Given the cost of the Internet service here, we could have stayed at a much nicer hotel that included free Internet in the room charges. As we had two laptops, we are paying an additional $40/day, $20 for each laptop. For all that extra cost, I could not upload pictures to an online photo sharing site due to the slow connection and data restrictions. I especially loved the fact that there are endless tour groups of young American teenagers roaming about the hotel. Loud and rude, this is really what I wanted for the start of my vacation in Australia. The location was nice, at the south end of Hyde Park and the breakfast buffet was decent. However, at $22 it was fairly expensive by even Sydney standards. To give the hotel credit, after contacting my travel agents local representative, the hotel offered to credit back all internet charges. Alas, not so easy as at check out we had to present the letter provided from the hotel manager stating this. The internet charges were still on the bill.

We stayed at the hotel for three days. In our opinion, we would rank this hotel similar to a Best Western or Holiday Inn Express (Without the 'free' breakfast). There is no such thing as a 'free breakfast' in Sydney. A cup of coffee will cost you anywhere from $2.50-$3.50. Do not believe all the negative reviews. They are FAR from the truth. When we arrived, around 11 AM, we were informed that our room would not be ready until after lunchtime (2 PM). They offered to hold our luggage and check it in should we wish to go find something to eat. Since we were obviously tired, we choose to sit in the hotel lobby for a few minutes. We were quickly greeted by the front desk staff who informed us our room was ready. They also stated they would give us a room on the top floor that would be quieter and less crowded from traveling groups. A few things to keep in mind when staying at this location: 1. You are south of all the attractions, but within walking distance of everything. 2. Try to stay on the top floor of the hotel (we stayed on 18) as it seemed to be less noisy than the other floors. 3. Internet is much cheaper just a few blocks away at place called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Internet Everywhere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It has an orange sign and was suggested by the hotel staff. For $2, you can get a full hour rather than 20 minutes for the same price in the hotel lobby. 4. The breakfast is NOT included in the Travellodge rate. If you want a hot breakfast, be prepared for a $17/person rate. If you can get it included in your rate...do so...it is a fairly nice breakfast! 5. Travellodges frequently, in Australia, host larger groups. This means that when you book a room, you want to make SURE you communicate with the front desk to not be on those floors. This will get you in a better part of the hotel and you will enjoy it more.

There are a number of 24-hour convenience stores within a few metres of the hotel. Room was clean and modern, with good twin beds, a table and chairs, a TV with a good selection of satellite channels, air-conditioning, a microwave, a selection of local takeaway menus who would deliver to your room, and a well furnished bathroom. Hotel also provided a bar; restaurant; several guest laundries with coin operated washers, driers and laundry powder dispensers; and four coin-operated internet computers in the lobby. There are elevators to all floors. Only down sides were that the room was initially made up as a double when we'd requested a twin (this was quickly remedied); and the key-swipes in the lift seem a little unreliable (my key needed to be 're-programmed' twice).

He also refused to give me any documentation to prove that we were at the hotel at 6:30am so that I could complain to our travel agent. We were basically told come back in 7 hours. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get a map. Even though there being a pad full of maps behind the desk. When finally checking in we were given no information regarding breakfast times or the fact that your key would only work when swiped in the lift. On our return after our first night our room key didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Whilst travelling in the lift there were two prostitutes (sorry escort girls) with security passes issued. There appeared to be a high demand for these \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcescort girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with several brochures advertising the different agencies. The hotel was only about two minutes away from the sex district so I suppose that it was logical that this hotel was used. The double glazing in the room was none existent which for a city is unforgivable and given the fact that the bottle banks were emptied every morning at 5am this provided an unwelcome wake up call. The reception was very punctual also ringing our room at 6am with a wake up call even though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t request one.

Having booked through Wotif.com, I was in a twin room on the 4th floor (had requested a double room when I booked but when I got here I was told that, as I had booked through Wotif, I didn't get any choice). The room was not clean by any reasonable standard, especially the bathroom. The carpet was stained in a number of places and just generally looked filthy. The fridge had a number of unidentified stains both inside and out. The bathroom floor didn't look like it had been cleaned for some time and, perhaps worst of all, someone had picked their nose and wiped it onto the wall by the sink (ironically, right next to the tissue dispenser). The outside of the toilet bowl had something on it which I dare not even venture a guess as to what it was. The two air vents were caked in dust. The grouting around the tiles was yellow and the tiles themselves were dirty. To top it all off, flies were getting into the room somewhere, either via the filthy vents or the ageing aircon unit that looms over the door. I killed about 15 of them during my fun-filled 6 night stay. The hotel is clearly popular with the Asian tourist market and I often found myself queuing for one of the three small lifts each time a bus load had just checked in. For a 17 floor building, 3 small lifts is clearly not enough. The doors are loud and squeaky so if, as I was, you're next door to some apparently restless people, the incessant squeaking and slamming will be very annoying. In the spirit of diplomacy, I would say that the hotel is in a good central location and, for the $99 per night I paid, it was cheap for somewhere in the central business district.

The Rocks, Opera House and Harbour Bridge are all within 20-30mins leisurely walking distance or can be reached by public transport. In keeping with most Travelodge properties the hotel has relatively basic facilities with no restaurant or bar, although breakfast is available. There are plenty of food and drink vending machines and coin operated laundry facilities, and microwaves and basic crockery provided in bedrooms.

Stayed at the Travelodge, after going through some rigorous hotel hunting online. They offered a very attractive price for a minimum 5 night stay. The hotel looks relatively new from the outside. Check-in at the reception was a speedy affair, with just one queue for the reception which handled check-ins, check-outs, concierge, airport shuttle bookings, luggage storage (I would imagine a long queue if the hotel was full or if there was a big group at the hotel). The rooms were simple and well-appointed. We had a 12th floor room and this came with 2 single beds, a mini-kitchenette/corner with microwave, fridge and additional sink. While the furnishings were relatively sparse throughout the room, we felt this was more than sufficient for a very comfortable sleep. The bathrooms were relatively small, with only a shower area/corner. This was a little problemmatic because it shares the same flooring as the rest of the bathroom, and hence, water from the shower would tend to seep out and wet the whole bathroom, making for a wet floor! Location-wise, the hotel is slightly south of Hyde Park. We walked a fair bit in Sydney. Average timings from the hotel to Circular Quay/Sydney Opera House/The Rocks - 20-25mins, Darling Harbour - 20mins, Chinatown - 5mins, MYER/Pitt Street Mall - 15mins, Star City Casino - 30-35mins. Taxi to the Hotel from the Domestic Terminal at Sydney Airport came up to $26.50 including Airport tolls. The shuttle bus service that runs every half hour from the hotel cost $12 per person and is convenient if travelling alone. Otherwise, a taxi wouldn't cost much more and you would save a good 20mins spent picking passengers from the other hotels.

Apart from the breakfast there are no restaurant facilities. Speaking of breakfast, do yourself a favour and eat somewhere in town as the breakfast here is not really worth the money. Cereals, fruit juice, ham, cheese and some sterile mhot items make up the list but they don't amount to much, so if you can eat elsewhere.

However, they really are inflexible as to their check-in policy of 2pm, reasoning that they are fully booked (really?) and that they have no room to give you when you arrive for example around 8am from the early morning flights to Sydney. They do have a baggage storage area, but I don't think it's secure enough, especially since they cannot check your tag and bag tag if they are busy with those people lining up in the front desk. Location is admittedly not that central, but it is quite accessible within a 10 minute walk either to the main streets (Elizabeth St., Pitt St., George St., Liverpool St., Oxford St.) or to train and bus stations. So location is still good, considering that hotels in the main streets are priced a lot more expensive. The room is quite spacious, for the price.

Cleanliness has never been a problem for me, and towels and the other reusables are replenished each day. It's funny that the elevator says guests should swipe their cards for the car to stop in your floor, but even without doing so, it stops in your floor nevertheless. The breakfast is basic for $16.50.
