We had already booked the rest of our week in other hotels, but when we decided to extend our stay in Amsterdam by one night, we chose to return to Hoksbergen.

The bathroom was small (similar to a bathroom in an RV), had nothing more than the essentials, had very poor water pressure, but was spotlessly clean. On our return visit, we were placed in a different room which was much bigger with a decent sized bathroom and excellent shower.

This is a 2 star hotel located on one of Amsterdam's beautiful canals - easily within walking distance of the station or 3 stops on the tram. I extended my stay, so ended up moving rooms, staying in a double on the 3rd floor, a single on the 1st floor and a twin on the 2nd floor - all rooms overlooked the canal - a really lovely sight at night and then in the morning. The boats on the canal and the cyclists on the road beneath my windows did not disturb me at all and I had the windows open all night. The reception staff were extremely helpful - going out of their way to show me places of interest on the map and give me directions, the rooms are very basic (no air conditioning but windows open and fans in each room) but clean - the 2nd and 3rd floor rooms had the prettiest views, the breakfast room is pleasant, with a good choice of food - breakfast finishes at 10 am but coffee and food was still available and guests still eating a lot later - so a relaxed atmosphere. I paid 105 Euros for the double room and 84 Euros for the single and the twin - prices included breakfast and local taxes. There is a much plusher hotel right next door, (with exactly the same views over the canal), so I decided to compare prices. I was offered a single room at 185 Euros, excluding breakfast and taxes, so I realised how lucky I was to have found my hotel, in what seems to me to be a very expensive city when it comes to hotel accommodation! I walked everywhere from this hotel with no difficulty whatsoever - it is close to Anne Frank's house, the flower market, Dam Square and involves a longer walk along beautiful canals to the Museum area. I walked back alone from a late boat trip at about 11.15 pm on Saturday night and felt safe amongst other walkers and cyclists. When I left and headed to the station, I caught a tram from 2 streets behind the hotel - purchasing my ticket on board the tram - cost - 2.6 Euros. The hotel had told me a taxi would cost about 15-18 Euros as it was a short journey. This is not a hotel where you can relax in lounges and bars - there is just the breakfast room - but if you want somewhere to sleep, shower and have breakfast, at a reasonable price in a pricey city and then spend your time out and about - enjoying beautiful Amsterdam - it's perfect. I would strongly recommend this hotel but with one reservation - it is an old canal house and as such has extremely steep narrow stairs up to the rooms - adding to its charm and character - but there is no elevator, so if you do plan to stay in this hotel - it would be a good idea to travel light - trying to get large, heavy suitcases up and down the stairs would not be much fun! I think you would probably end up unpacking downstairs and leaving the bulk of your luggage in the room behind reception, where I noticed the hotel let visitors leave luggage if they arrived before rooms had been cleaned or wanted to look around Amsterdam and leave later in the day. The hotel staff do help with luggage but there is no doorman or porter on duty. If you intend to stay in any of the canal house hotels, it's probably worth checking if there is an elevator if you have any difficulty climbing and descending extremely steep stairs.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bainbridge Island", "Title": "\u201cClassic Old Canal House\u201d", "Author": "CK2009", "ReviewID": "UR116350323", "Content": "We spent the last night of our recent European trip in Amsterdam, this time staying at the Hotel Hoksbergen.

There are tons of restaurants and even a large grocery store (Albert Heijn) within a couple blocks. The desk clerks were also so helpful and friendly. Breakfast was included; it was simple - toast, meat, jam, coffee, juice, hard-cooked eggs, muesli - but tasty. Wi-Fi was also free throughout the hotel. The rooms, however, were definitely dated and small. My room reminded me vaguely of an indoor cabin on cruise ship...from the 70s. Yes, it had a window, but it was basically a room that just fit two twin beds and a minuscule bathroom. It was very clean, just run-down and old. There was a small TV with several English channels. Also, note that because the hotel is in one of these old canal houses, it has a series of steep staircases and no elevator. The other guests I saw were couples in their 30's and older. Definitely the museum crowd, not the party crowd. So, if you're looking to spend lots of time in the room, require pillow-top mattresses with high-thread count sheets, or need to spread out and be pampered, this isn't for you.

The bathroom was so small that a person with a weight problem would not have been able to get to the toilet. Fortunately, we are not overweight. You also have to open the bathroom door to lean over the sink to wash your face or brush your teeth.

We had a very plessant stay here since the location is perfect! The hotel is placed in a very charming, quiet, clean, romantic street in the center of amsterdam. It took us about 3 minutes too walk into the main shopping streets, and it took us 30 sec to walk into \"the 9 streets\". (The 9 streets is a area with designer-shops and cafe's. Very nice!!!!) The hotel is a typically dutch kanal-house witch is 5 stores high. Inside it has a very cosy atmosfere with a very helpful staff!!! The staires is very steep, but a little exercise between all the shopping is good for your health;) The rooms and bathrooms are quite small, but large enough too sleep, rest and get clean in! If you are planning too stay inside your hotel room i would recomend you to find another hotel. This is not a luxurious hotel with all kind of services, but a cosy, clean and typically dutch kanal-hotel!!!! If you are planning too explore amsterdam, go shopping and eat at resturants, i can surely recomend this hotel! If you're going: - have an empty travelbag!!!

Let's start with the negative aspects. The room was extremely small - we had about 2 feet of floor space between the bed and the walls - barely enough room for our suitcase. But, we were not shocked by this as the owners (Xia/Bruno/Bert) had explained that the rooms were small. They also explained that the stairs were very steep. They are a little scary to be honest, and climbing them was a workout. If you have physical limitations or are in poor health, you will have a difficult time with the stairs. The bathroom was also very small - I am 5' 3\" and my knees touched the wall when I sat on the toilet. The last negative - the mattress was not very comfortable. It was not unbearable. Again, if you have back problems or need an excellent mattress, stay at another hotel. Now for the positives - we knew all the possible issues before we ever arrived at the Hoksbergen because the owners were very honest about their hotel. I asked a lot of questions and you should too, regardless of where you stay. The room was very clean and was made up every morning. The bedspread was old but clean, and the sheets were crisp and white. I am very picky in this area and did not have any issue. The breakfast was similar to an American continental breakfast. There was coffee, tea, toast, boiled eggs, lunchmeat and cheese, fruit, cereal, etc. It's included in the room price. The canal view is beautiful! The windows open wide and you can sit on the large windowsill and relax. There are pretty flower boxes on the windows too - a nice touch. Lastly, the owners were efficient and helpful. They called for a taxi when we asked, helped with directions, and recommended restaurants. I recommend emailing the hotel and asking any questions in advance so you know what to expect.

Upon arriving, I was quite charmed by the location and exterior of the hotel, the entry/breakfast room was also quaint. The man who checked us in however, was mildly unpleasant. Although there was another man who helped us throughout our stay who was quite friendly. The biggest disappointment came upon opening the door to our room, after walking up two flights of steep stairs. The room was stark, but not in a modern sense. It seemed to date from the 70's, the walls were plain for the most part. The linens appeared to date from the 70s, yet were not tattered. The biggest surprise came when we pulled back the bedspread to find a fleece blanket with a tiger printed across it, with a mysterious brownish stain towards the top. The bathroom was covered with brown linoleum and smelled too strongly of toilet disinfectant. We seriously considered finding a new hotel the next day. We decided against it primarily because the room was basically clean and comfortable and our primary objections were about the decor, or lack thereof. The breakfast was fine and included a choice of coffee or tea, breads, sandwich meats, cereal, among other simple choices. The location was the saving grace of this hotel, located on the Spui and within easy walking distance of all locations within the historic area of town. This was not my first choice of hotels to book when planning our trip, but I soon found that the other 10 or so hotels I was considering were booked. I spent more on this hotel per night than any others during our trip to Europe (London, Brugge, Paris), which added an extra sting to my disappointment with the room.

Good & Friendly Service though....\u201d", "Author": "PDXLadie", "ReviewID": "UR5438586", "Content": "THE BAD: First off, I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone extremely overweight or elderly. I am not a very large lady, but I had to turn sideways and squeeze into the restroom. I could shave my legs atop the toilet seat while taking a shower and use the sink all at the same time! Also, trying to get up and down those steep stairs can be very hazzardous. I was terrified of falling. Although the front desk person had said that he was not aware of anyone having ever fallen down those stairs, I don't know if I really believe him..... The room itself only had room for the bed and had a flat screen TV hanging on the wall, which was nice. While we were in Amsterdam, there was an unusual heatwave going on pushing up into the 90's. Our room, on the 4th floor, was so hot, it was almost unbearable. There was no air conditioning, which is the norm in Europe, but there was barely any ventilation either because the window only opened about 12 inches and the small measly fan provided did not reach to the window. It was very hot out, but that isn't really the hotel's fault. The room had kind of an out-dated feel to it with odd bedding (one blanket was a big velour one with a large tiger and bamboo print) and cigarette burns on the carpet. THE GOOD: The location was awesome, within walking distance to a lot of the great sites, but also far enough away from Damrak and The Dam that it can be somewhat quiet and peaceful too. The view over the Singel canal is classic Amsterdam. The service was great. The two brothers working in the morning were very nice and the breakfast buffet was excellent. Toast, cheeses, meats, hard boiled eggs, a variety of cereals, coffee, juice, milk, and water. It was yummy. SUMMARY: For the price, I was expecting a little more. More specifically, larger rooms with nicer bedding/decor. BUT, I think Amsterdam is just a really expensive city and is even more so when you are from the US and have to deal with the crummy US dollar to Euro exchange rate.", "Date": "July 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely recommend this one\u201d", "Author": "EmilyFS", "ReviewID": "UR5422445", "Content": "After reading the reviews we decided to stay at the Hoksbergen.

The canal-side location was picturesque and a great base for seeing much of Amsterdam and the hosts (Bruno, especially) could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Yes, the rooms are tiny and yes, the stairs are steep, but that's all part of the charm of staying in a historic building. We had two twin beds pushed together and got a great night's sleep on them. Some others below have mentioned a problem with the smell of smoke, but we did not detect any odor, and my wife is very sensitive to smoke. The breakfast included excellent coffee, granola, cereal, bread for toast, and the standard European cheese, cold cuts and eggs. Just be forewarned: the stairs really are steep and narrow, so if you travel with several large bags it will be a challenge getting them to your room and finding a place for them once you get there.

We chose the Hoksbergen based on location, price and the fact that breakfast was included. We were not disappointed. It is located a brief walk from almost everything, and it was safe, quaint, and practically silent on the streets at night for a good sleep. No young, rowdy people were staying while we were there - a lot of couples, young quiet 20-30 somethings and lone travellers. Our room was #1, the first after one flight of stairs off the hotel lobby and entry. We had no great view (only of a side street), and the room was REALLY small, but they warned us in advance since we got the last room in the place, so we were forewarned and fine with it. We had our own bathroom in our room with a shower, sink and toilet, but it was comedic how small it was!! The breakfast was nice and included toast, eggs, cereal, tea, coffee, juice, etc. More than enough to start the day. Everyone was nice and helpful. We were going to spend the other half of the week at another place, just to mix it up a bit, but after checking around at other places, nobody could beat the price and value of our room. Would definitely recommend trying for a canal view room since it will only be icing on the cake. I would stay here again, no problem! Great value if you are looking for a good deal and a nice stay. Not for the picky and high maintenance. Oh! Our room really smelled like smoke, which sucked for us since we are non-smokers, but we were also right above the office and the front desk person was a smoker, so the office smoke definitely drifted up to us. We would open the windows to clear it when we got home, but it always had a faint old smoke smell, much like a lot of Amsterdam!", "Date": "March 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "India", "Title": "\u201cperfect place in Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "koalacub", "ReviewID": "UR4101748", "Content": "Thanks Xia / Bruno / Bert for making our first visit to Amsterdam a memorable one.

This pleasant peaceful place is perfect for travelers on a small budget who dont want to sacrafice cleanliness and comfort for cheap rates. My stay at the hoksbergen was magical, the free dutch continental breakfast was so tantilizing- fresh squeezed oj, ice cold water, thick fresh dutch milk, variety of cereal (the best granola i have ever had!), yummy cold cuts ham, salami, cheese, soft boiled eggs, and the most wonderful jams and a delightful selection of toasts, what more could you ask for? The double room my friend and i stayed in was completlly quaint and immaculate. Fresh towels, clean sheets, extra pillows, everything was on point. The staff were so awesome, spoke excellent english and provided us with lots of valueable tips and advise for enjoying the wonders of the lovliest city in Europe. I can not count the numerous times my friend and I discussed how much we loved the hoksbergen. The location was perfect, close to every tourist sight, yet maintains the perfect distance from the hustle bustle, and noise of city, and is very safe.My friend and I, (two nineteen year old girls), felt completly secure during our stay One of the best and oldest bars in town Gollem, is right around the corner. Great Greek food is five steps down the street, and if the continental breakfast did not fill you up, there is an excellent bakery wich serves the freshest best smelling and tasting crossaints in all of the city. Oh and for all of you spliff smokin souls, numeous, numerous coffeeshops are just a hop, skip, and jump away!
