The problem with this hotel is the dilapidated state of the building. The carpets are stained, a/c grills are filthy, lampshades dingy and crooked, paint chipped, etc. These things aren't necessarily deal-breakers by themselves, but overall they end up making you wonder about the cleanliness of the bedding, etc. I neglected to ask for a non-smoking room at check-in, as I've become complacent, assuming that all hotels these days are non-smoking throughout. The 3rd floor is a smoking floor, and the corridor REEKS of smoke, so avoid that floor is you mind. I switched to the 4th floor after my first night, and it's smoke-odor free. Both rooms I had have the same problems: VERY thin walls (you can hear which song your neighbor's clock radio is playing when his alarm goes off at 5am), and VERY, VERY loud plumbing! I mean, when someone else turns on the shower, or flushes their loo, the abrupt torrent of water noise will wake you from a dead sleep. This noise is so loud that it makes conversation difficult in the room, and requires you to turn up the TV! I'm seriously not a very picky person about hotel rooms (I'm a pilot, I stay in hundreds), but trust me, this is not a restful experience. Oh, and the thin walls? Well, this is an AIRPORT hotel, and you may mind airplane noise a bit more than I do! :) Other, more minor issues: the wifi was sometimes very slow, and the showers are quite weak, and if the hotel is in \"heating\" mode, rather than \"a/c\" mode, your only option to keep your room cool for the night will be to open your window (see above re: airport hotel)..

Our rooms were on the first floor and it was frigid on the entire floor and with no good explanation other than the hotel was saving a buck on heating costs. Fortunately, our rooms had thermostats, but the heat wasn't on in any of the rooms. We promptly turned ours up quite high to heat the ENORMOUS room we had. We could have played a game of touch Football in there. The room finally warmed up sometime in the night. The bathrooms were nice and it appeared that the tile had recently been replaced. However, one very noticeable thing missing were any form of grab-bars in the shower. We were traveling with my grandmother so this was a concern of ours. We didn't make a change as we had checked in rather late in the evening but were surprised the bars were not standard. The following morning, we ate at the attached cafe and it was horrible!

The comforter was, alas, the somewhat scratchy kind popular in most hotels. The shower area looked quite nice with actual tile and it was absolutely spotless, even in the corners. The shower-head was a large, non-mobile type with many little streams of water, and the hot water was impressively hot. As of August 2011, the wi-fi was free, fast, and stable.

First, the hotel is literally across the street from the Seattle Airport, and the hotel shuttle picks you up incredibly promptly once you give them a quick call from the curbside courtesy phone. Believe me, I have waited much, much longer for some other hotel shuttles. The hotel itself is clean, quiet and very comfortable, with all the necessary toiletries and electronic hook-ups that we all rely on these days. I travel alone most of the time so I really appreciate the fact that my requests (which I have made ahead of time with the hotel) for a room on an upper floor are always accommodated, unlike some other hotels near this airport that I have stayed with in the past where a few front desk clerks seemed incredibly put-out by my request. I also think that it is very reasonably priced. My flights always seem to arrive either very early or very late when the restaurant next door is closed, so I appreciate the little snack-for-purchase area that is located right next to the front counter. This past trip I again arrived very late and decided to take advantage of the restaurant,13 Coins, that is literally two parking lots away and is open 24 hours a day. It's a safe, short walk to good food. The staff has always been courteous and very efficient.

Normally I can dry my hair in five minutes. It took me twenty minutes before my hair was finally dry! Also, the $10.00 self-parking rate, we felt, was a bit too high.

The location of the hotel is right on the main drag, international blvd and is literally right across the street from the airport. Very safe and clean area. I was at the hotel for business with the manager and also for leisure. When we arrived, parking was easy and FREE. The lobby was very nice and the people at the desk were very professional and helpful. The hotel has two elevators that service all floors and also goes to a basement where I think the underground parking was. We were given a room on the 5th floor, the top floor, and when we got to our room, the manager had three gift bags waiting for us on the desk. That showed us right there that they cared. I later met with the manager on schedule and thanked her for them. The rooms were very spacious, stylish, and clean. Great after a long day downtown. We had a small issue with our bedspread so we left a note for Mary, the housekeeper. The next day it was changed and she left a note apologizing for the issue. We felt that it was taken care of properly, quickly, and with class. Thank you Mary! We didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant, but heard that it was very good. The pool area was very nice, but could use just a little bit of updating. The hot tub was very spacious and warm with a view of the outdoor pool. Great for a cool day in Seattle. Overall, the best of the airport hotels. Great location, caring and courteous staff, and best of all, spotless! When we return to Seattle, we will certainly stay here.

This is the first time we encountered miscommunication regarding when the number of days for parking actually begin. This hotel has \"packages\" 7-day & 10-day parking for a fee with 1-night stay. (Previous hotels actually had \"free parking\") We were leaving 10/14 @ 6AM for Puerto Vallarta, Mexico travelling thru SanFrancisco & returning on 10/21 @ 11:30pm. When we checked in on the 13th, we paid the upgrade fee for 7-days of parking, \"MasterPark\" employees parked the car. Unbeknownst to us, our 1st day began the 13th when we checked in because they parked the car that evening. We should have parked the car in the Hotel parking lot for that evening, then handed the keys over in the morning, 3:30am prior to taking the shuttle over. However, while waiting for the shuttle we spoke to another party staying at the hotel & evidently someone had left their luggage in the car overnight in the hotel parking lot & it was missing the next morning. So...do not leave your luggage in the parked car!!! Needless to say, our return flight was delayed; we arrived at 12:05am at Seatac & to the hotel approx. 12:40am. Technically we were in the 9th day, so they charged us $16.99!!!! for each day over the 7. In summary, beware of ParkNFly offers that are not actually initiated & run by the hotel, the hotel staff may not be trained adequately. Clarify the exact dates included for parking with the parking company or hotel & have it in writing & initialed by the staff. Never leave luggage in parked vehicle.
