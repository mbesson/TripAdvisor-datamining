We came as part of the Vacation Club in April 2012. This is a beautiful ocean front property with a large pool, kiddie pool, hot tub (which was nice and clean), spa, fitness center and a private beach with just enough surf to make it fun for younger kids. The hotel was only about 1/3 occupied, so there was no need to \"stake out\" beach chairs or pool chairs. All rooms face the ocean/pool. However, lower level rooms get a view a bit blocked by palm trees (we were on the 6th floor of 8...perfect) and rooms to the far left (as you face the hotel) get a partial view of the abandoned hotel next door. The pool and beach area has a lot of space with plenty of shade in the form of palm trees and umbrellas to complement the sun-lover areas. At night or after it rains, the palm trees come alive with bird calls and coqui. We had a 2 bedroom suite, which sleeps 8 for two adults and two teens (16 and 17.) The suite room has a bathroom/shower, jacuzzi tub, full kitchen, living/dining room with pull-out, balcony seating 4 and bedroom with king bed. The 1 bedroom/studio has considerably less space...bed, pull-out, microwave, mini-fridge, bathroom/shower, balcony. Both rooms have access to washer/dryer. The rooms were clean, quiet and relatively well maintained. The bathrooms do show their age a little bit. There is a small though pretty well stocked market store on the property with basics (milk, bread, soda, etc.) and pool/ocean toys. There is an outdoor bar that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner with limited hours, but no restaurant on property. You will need a car if you stay here. There are no restaurants/activities/grocery within walking distance. The hotel does provide some tour information/sign up, but it's pricey. There are several good restaurants in Dorado (The Greenhouse, Made in PR, Faccio Pizza), a SuperMax grocery, etc. We ate a few meals in town but spent most of the week exploring in the afternoons so we ate in Old San Juan and in other parts of the island. It is a bit of a drive to get to Old San Juan or other points of interest (National Rainforest, Ponce, etc.) If you enjoy resorts buzzing with activity, this is probably not the place for you. However, if you're looking for a peaceful, relaxing place to stay as a jumping off point for your adventures in PR, this is the place!", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cLovely vacation spot\u201d", "Author": "CricketNut91", "ReviewID": "UR127305467", "Content": "We have been owners at the Hacienda Del Mar for 12 years, so we are well aware of the history concerning the Hyatt Cerromar closing several years ago, along with most of the restaurants and the river pool. We decided to return this year, after a 2-year absence, because we had heard that things were happening next door (the old Hyatt Dorado). The grounds of the property are still impeccably maintained, as was our unit (we have a 2-bedroom). At the owners meeting last Monday morning we were told that plans are underway for redecorating the rooms. However, despite some prior reviews saying the decor is \"dated\" we feel that the units are still in excellent shape. We also learned at the owners' meeting that the Fairmount organization has recently decided that they are not interested in being the operator of the hotel that will be at the site of the old Cerromar and that the developer of the project, which is the property of the former Dorado and Cerromar, is looking for a new operator. Let me just digress for a moment and say that we drove around the old Dorado site, which is heavily under construction! Major events are happening there - it will reopen in December 2012 as a Ritz Carlton resort and it looks like it will be amazing. We were even able to have dinner at the beachfront restaurant Friday night. We hope that the rebirth of the Dorado will have a very positive effect on the Hacienda Del Mar. Once the Ritz Carlton/Dorado is open, the developer hopes to build a 400-room hotel and casino at the old Cerromar property. The new hotel, however, will be adjacent to the golf course, not on top of the Hacienda like the old hotel is. Anyway - we found that there was more activity this year at the Hacienda than at any year we have gone after the hotel closed. While it was far from crowded, we noticed that there was a variety of guests - seniors, families with children of all ages, couples, and a couple groups of spring-breakers who behaved very well! I must say, when we were there 2 years ago it was a little dead with no kids for our kids to pal around with. It is nice to go somewhere and not have to get up at 7am to put towels on the chairs so you have a spot at the beach or the pool. The hotel still has the Blu Bohio, which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner (make sure you check the dinner hours). Food and drinks were very good, with a nice variety. I think someone's grandmother was in the back making the rice and beans - they were amazing! We had a car, so we were able to stock up at the nearby Amigo supermarket, and we also had dinner at the Chop House (sushi), La Terratza (great mofongo) and the Metropol (?) - a Puerto Rican and Cuban place in the shopping center that has the Starbucks. All in all, we are very hopeful that the Hacienda Del Mar is on its way back to being the preferred destination of 10 years ago. As I said above, it is still carefully maintained, with plans for improvement underway. We know that some of the owners have given up and relinquished their rights to their timeshare - we are very happy that we have stuck it out and are looking forward to our next visit!", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSolid Property in a Remote Location\u201d", "Author": "ViajeNut", "ReviewID": "UR126642895", "Content": "I stayed at the Hyatt Hacienda Del Mar, a vacation club property, in February 2012 for some R&R and my Wife's B'Day. The property is about a half hour drive from San juan Int'l. I had a rental car because a cab ride is allegedly $50 each way. The property is located in Dorado, which is a suburb about 20 minutes from the tourist section of Condado and Old San Juan. Because of that, If your looking for excitement and lots of activity, this isn't the place for you!!!!! Overall, this is a solid, well-maintained property. The rooms and grounds are clean and the staff is pleasant. However, the resort is dated and in need of an update. I had a 1 bedroom villa with a spacious living area and master suite. Everything was in working order, clean and functional; just not very modern. Since I had a full kitchen, I stocked up on water and a small amount of groceries from a local supermarket. We did half our dining in the room and half at the resort and around the neighborhood. I would definitely recommend El Vacahon, a neighborhood restaurant. Its absolutely fantastic!!! Also, i would recommend Zafra, an upscale restaurant in Plantation Village, a neighboring golf club location. There is only 1 restaurant on site and it closes early!!! We ate there a few times. It had a typical beach bar and grill menu with a Latin Flair. The food was good, but nothing to go crazy over. The pool area was large and there were plenty of seats available no matter what time of day. The beach was extremely windy and almost chilly!!! I'm not sure if it was the time of year or just rough seas during my time there. At times, people had towels over themselves because the breeze was so strong. A rental car is a must unless you intend to stay at the resort all day. You can't walk to anything in the area. Getting a Cab can be near impossible at certain times of the day. That is just the way it is in this area. Another couple told us that they were at the Embassy Suites down the road for dinner 1 evening and they couldn't get a cab. It was 8pm when they tried, so it wasn't even late in the evening. The surrounding area is in transition. A Ritz Carlton Reserve resort and residence is being constructed in the next few years, so the neighborhood is on the rise. Allegedly, If your a guest of this resort, you'll have access to the Ritz's facilities. I'll believe that when I see it.

That being said, sometimes its better to , as they say, not sweat the small stuff. As mch as we would like, things won't always be perfect. On arrival at the airport, we were greeted by our Dorado Tours shuttle driver John with a placard with our names on it so it was easy to locate. John greeted us and even stopped at the local grocery store on the way to the hotel so that we could stock up. That saved us a trip out later on. John also gave us information on tours that we might like. We took advantage of that and he brought us to Old San Juan and the Bacardi tour. It seemed like John was our own personal driver for the day! He dropped us off at the ferry, made sure we were all set with tickets and gave us times to get back so that he could pick up up(right on time waiting for us) and take us to the Bacardi factory. Once again he got out and set us up with the tours tickets (we could have easily done that), and waited for us to finish the tour. Again, on the way back to the hotel he asked us if we needed to stop anywhere while we were out. He was GREAT! All of the Staff at the hotel were very cordial the entire stay. In my opinion, you only get attitude if you give it! Had a problem with the in room safe, fixed within the hour! Rooms were nice, clean, and very comfortable. The unit had everything we needed. We never had any problems with noisy neighbors (first time in a long time on vaca we didn't have noisy neighbors). Being a home owner I realize that nothing stays brand new forever. Sure, some things need updating, but it never took away from the stay. The closed hotel next door never bothered us either, we were too busy enjoying the beach and the pool to really even notice! The beach was awesome, a little rough and windy, but whatever. Still a great time. Were there some negatives? Sure, but again, we didn't let those little things ruin our stay!! The night shuttle driver Felix, was awesome as well! He recommended places to eat ( he was always right!), got out and made sure we had tables, never made us wait, and also stopped at a store for us. He was great company and an all around nice guys, thanks! La Marena (sp) had great food. The Greenhouse Cafe was awesome as well! Great Ribs! went again just for the ribs, best I have had. The Pika Restaraunt was within walking distance. It was ok, to us, nothing to rave about. We walked that night to Pika, and on the way back at the beginning of the hotel entrance, Felix was driving by and told us to hop in to get a ride back. We would have enjoyed the walk back, but appreciated Felix for offering. My wife and I didn't do much but enjoy a relaxing time at the Hyatt.

The reviews about the resort are all accurate: great beach, nice pool, rooms and resort are dated, great fitness facility, great tennis courts, very helpful staff. They will do anything to make your stay as pleasant as possible. We asked for an upgrade from a 1 to a 2 BR unit which they did for $50/night. The sofa bed was terrible and the sofa itself was pretty gross with big stains on the cushions. We thought it was well worth it. We were there a week and I wish we had more time to explore San Juan. It's about 30 - 40 minutes away but I didn't find the traffic all that bad. Perhaps if you are from rural America it would be overwhelming but so would any big US city. We found an outstanding restaurant in San Juan called Juan Enrique's. It was in an interesting area with live music on Saturday night, funky bars and clubs all around and seemed to be quite safe. GO THERE! The food was moderately priced, great atmosphere and great service. We loved Old San Juan and I wish we had another day there. We went to Camuy Caverns and that was a fun day trip. It's not the biggest or best but it's a pleasant drive and about an hour away. We toured the Bacardi Rum distillery and that was pretty fun. There is a lot to do at the resort in the way of activities but we are pretty physical people who love tennis, the beach, working out, etc. If you are a couch potato who doesn't do much physical the resort doesn't have great restaurants or night club entertainment.

We did observe some folks putting towel on chair and not returning for hours. I suppose the ultra-private/secluded beach was so much better they stayed there ? The green fence, blocking view of neighboring & closed hotel is NOT an eyesore or any trouble at all. That being closed assured us a VERY large and private beach; just like others have reported here. Our room was on 5th floor so we were higher than the pool area palm trees thus able to clearly see ocean and never ending waves. Very nice! We had great slush drinks at poolside bar. Exercise room is well equipped, yet the elliptical machines seem more home-style than those rated for gym (non-stop) use. The elliptical I used worked fine but clearly would have benefited from a tune-up. They supply wipes to pre, and post, clean your machine. The weight machines were abundant, in good shape, and no lines. Staff was top notch. As others have reported, this place is not physically far from San Juan, but when you add traffic, its a nightmare to try and return to hotel between 4 and 7pm. I truly wish Obama would provide New Jersey the highway funding that somehow Puerto Rico gets.There are orange cones on EVERY roadway and construction guys at all hours of day doing work. About 1 mile outside hotel property is a very large and well stocked grocery store. Its accross street from CVS. The hotel has 2 BBQ propane grills on the beach, so you can easily grill up anything you get at store. The folks around San Juan are truly friendly. While the Policia are EVERYWHERE!!!, we never felt need for them.I asked about getting cigars and I was surprised how many speak english and truly wanted to help me. We got the strong sense that the locals wanted us to be happy. Bottom Line: If trip is to tour San Juan (which I strongly recommend) then this hotel location is not good (again, due to traffic).

We had a lovely view on the 7th floor and could see the ocean from our living room/balcony.

My girlfriend & I pulled in while transversing the island & traveling east from Arecibo/Rincon/Isabela. We had one night left before embarking on our last night in Old San Juan. I always wanted to venture into Dorado, so we pulled into town blindly. I aimlessly drove down the road looking for a resort (price was no option since we were tired and wanted a \"resort\" type place to call home for the night.) We finally found the resort and were stopped at the gate by a guard. He called ahead (a bit surprised at our lack of a reservation), & received the go ahead for our impromptu entrance. The grounds are stellar and vast to say the least. The rate for a studio apt (larger than many studios; this place was built in the 60's-70's I believe) was ideal and much less than the pricier San Juan Metro area. The building iteself is set back a bit from the ocean, but the waves are visible & heard nonetheless. So, I woke from a nap around 7PM prior to out dinner adventure into town & was surprised to see a LARGE section of the property (a separate buliding to the East) from our balcony that was completely DARK. I initially thought that the complex was slow but upon some quick internet research, I realized that this building used to be a part of the hotel (or separate back in the 90's). The building was sinking and included a casino, restaurants, etc. There was also a world famous \"lazy pool\" that surrounded the hotel that is now fenced off from the remaining 2 Hyatt buildings. I've read and heard conflicting reports that this hotel is being renovated & due for demolition and reconstruction. However, it was an ominous & strange sight since the darkness is ever present being so close to a major resort/hotel.

We started our first day next to the pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the pristine, empty pool. We lounged and swam for a while, until our feet started to fry on the concrete apron that surrounds the pool. So we picked up our towels and moved to the beach, mere steps from the pool. Edged in palm trees and with a blue sky above, the ocean cove was breezy and the sand didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t burn our feet. Every few hours a small raincloud would pass over; sometimes it was hard to tell if it was raining at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the raindrops were light and warm. We lazed our first day away. Mike and I want to return to the Hacienda Del Mar because it is peaceful and quiet. If you are looking for a fun and lively nightlife, this is not the timeshare resort for you; however, if you are in the mood to chill out and spend meaningful time with your significant other, we highly recommend the resort. We rented a car so we could leave the resort any time we chose; that said, the Hacienda Del Mar does arrange for shuttle services (based on demand) to Old San Juan casinos, the rain forest and other places. A fee is paid directly to the driver. We used a shuttle to go to Old San Juan one evening since parking there is difficult, at best; our driver was chatty, the vehicle well maintained and we got back and forth safely. The rooms at the Hacienda Del Mar, although not brand new, are clean and pleasant; our balcony provided a wonderful view of the cove and ocean beyond. The staff was friendly and kind.

The staff is very pleasant and the beach is quite nice. If I were to nitpick, the rooms are a bit dated with older finishings, television etc, but ours did have a fabulous ocean view! Additionally, self-service laundry facilities were available immediately outside the room. The wifi was a bit slow, but at least that keeps you from spending all your time online! Finally, the closed hotel right next to the Hyatt was a bit depressing. The restaurant is hit or miss. Some items are great and a good deal and some items are dramatically overpriced. The first night I had the burger for $7.95. It was big and the flavor was excellent. My wife had the beefsteak sandwich for a dollar more and it was cold, the beef was tough and it left a strange taste in our mouths for a while after. The next night we had salads, which were very expensive for what they were. $14-16 each for a very average salad. Finally, we ate breakfast before leaving the last day. The food was great, portions were big and the price was good. $8 for 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and sausage. However, coffee was $1.80, refills were $.90 and a can of Sprite was $2.50! Moral of the story, choose carefully and the meal might be worth it. The other thing to keep in mind is the location. Dorado is west of San Juan, so if you are driving anywhere in the South or going to the West via the South, you may have to pass through the traffic hell that is San Juan in both directions. Example: One day we took a trip to El Yunque to go hiking. Leaving at about 12:30pm It took us around an hour and a half to get there, even with a short stop o eat and stroll through an outlet mall. On the way home (left the forest at 6pm) it took us over 2 hours, including sitting on 22E in what resembled a parking lot more than a highway. Of course that's driving in PR I suppose!

It is a FABULOUS hotel, the grounds are great, the 24 hour pool is great. But this last stay was horrible! The Bohio grill overcharged us for the wings, then after signing the bill and charging it to the room the man added on a 20% tip AFTER THE BILL WAS CLOSED!!! I had to spend two days fighting for my $3.08 back, I know it sounds like a small amount considering we spent almost $200.00 for the one bedroom rental, but it was the fact that it was taken from us and was done sneaky! This was one bill of hot wings that we were overcharged for, so I can only imagine if we ate there frequently how much they would have overcharged us! Then when I showed the manager that I was overcharged she told me, \"It's only three dollars, I will give it to you out of my pocket\", but she never did, I had to continue to fight for it. We rented the one bedroom because it states that it comes with a whirlpool tub and spacious closets...when we arrived there was NO tub, and the closet was one foot wide, we couldn't unpack because there was no place to hang our clothes, we requested a room change but the manager said they were totally booked, although there was only 12 people or less in the pool and about six on the beach, there is no way it was booked! The manager told me she would have a room ready for us in the morning, I called at noon and the room wasn't ready, I went down and waited at her desk at 3pm and she told me it would be ready in five minutes, I waited over an hour for it to be ready and she kept telling me five minutes, I then waited upstairs in the room and after 25 minutes she called to say it was available, so I wasted one and a half days at the front desk trying to get the three dollars refunded to me, and I wasted a day in a room that was not what we paid for, and another half a day was wasted waiting for the room we paid for to be ready for us! Total waste! The other reason I rated this low is because I am a stickler for safety, the security guard was sleeping on several occasions. I have always rated this hotel as a five in the past, but it seems like the more we stayed there the more they resented us and gave us bad service and bad rooms. In the first room we stayed the shower made a horrible noise and shook the walls, by chance I ran into the repairman and he was very polite, he asked me if everything was working in the room, I told him the shower sounds like a jackhammer and he told me, \"I will fix it, go to the manager and change rooms\", this was on the first day we were there, so even he knew there where rooms available!!! I really feel that we overstayed our welcome and the staff became resentful and that is why they gave us such a horrible room and not the room we paid for! I HATE being lied to!!!

VERY outdated and very uncomfortable sleeping. We wore our shoes the whole time we were in the room because the floor felt gross. Everything in the room (we stayed in a studio) was outdated and not appealing.

We could see our feet in the water and the temperature was great! We always had lounge chairs available to us and did not have to get out to the beach super early to get them. There were ALOT of families there which I was surprised by. It seemed like a lot of them were from the Puerto Rico surrounding areas. The pool was very busy during the day full of young families. We stuck to the beach except at night we would occasionally swim. The \"tiki\" bar on site has pretty decent food but gave me very bad heartburn every time I ate there (lots of fried food).

OMG...then at check out they are banging on your door BEFORE 10AM when check out is at 10am....DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR WEEK ON THIS PLACE! the inside of the unit is so outdated, from the 70's...worn out old! the kitchen has fake cabinet fronts that do not open, and again are all worn out....the shower is tiny and has a dirty old curtain on it. and worn out old uncleanable grout/tile....the metal shelf in the shower is all tarnished and old....IT IS JUST AN OLD OLD OUTDATED PLACE....I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THE OWNERS OF HERE! THE ENTIRE PLACE NEEDS TO BE GUTTED AND REDONE! IT DEFINATELY HAS POTENTIAL BUT DOES NOT MEET UP TO HYATT STANDARDS!!!!! beds are old and lumpy, pillows are flat.....you can not see the ocean from your balcony as there are too many palm trees blocking the view!!!

My first child turned 4 when we were there and my twins were less than 9 months. Totting 3 small kids, I wanted a place with a kitchen & location on the beach so we would never have to leave the resort. This place had both and I was surprised by the size of the kiddie pool. They also have daily activities for young kids, like coloring contest, painting, family bingo, arts & crafts, etc. Before we arrived at the hotel we had the driver stop at the grocery store. I picked up bread & cold cuts, chicken wings, bagels & cream cheese, cereal, milk, salad, etc and a birthday cake & balloons for the birthday party. My mom ate at the resort restaurant once, but I never had to eat out! I did have some drinks though. They gave us 2 cribs and 2 high chairs for our stay which was also great! Our trip was easy & very relaxing. The only negative things were that the place did feel icky. I never mentioned the reviews to my mom about the place not feeling clean and she brought it up on her own. She said it's not cleaned well and had a mildew feeling/smell. One day the floor felt so yucky I couldn't even bare to take my shoes off. If any staff or owners read this I would like to suggest airing the place out and cleaning w/ bleach, ammonia, lysol etc after each stay. Also replacing the dark comforters with airy fluffy white ones will give it a more clean feel. Maybe doing the same for the curtains too! Of course it would be awesome if the bathrooms were updated too, but I understand this is not a luxury hotel so I can deal with it. Overall very relaxing trip and good for families.

It does not take away from the stay, but it is just strange to see the property sitting vacant. I spoke with someone involved with the property that said Fairmont Hotel has signed a contract to manage a new hotel there, but the are tearing down the old one once financing is in place. This is still a long way off. ROOMS: Now, the rooms at the hotel were very nice. We stayed on the 7th floor and had a full two bedroom. Nice rooms, very clean, and great kitchen/dining space. The balconies were great, and faced the pool area/ocean. The kitchen could use a little more in the way of plates and utensils, but overall, it was pretty good. The housekeeping came once during the week on Tuesday. You are able to request clean towels, but this is a time share/rental property and not a hotel. We requested a crib, high chair and extra pillows, and all requests were met. The staff at the front desk did a nice job trynig to help us with any requests. POOL/BEACH: The pool was nice, but it is not heated. This was a little issue for the kiddie pool, as it was very cold the first two days. The staff did an average job is cleaning out the pools. One morning the kiddie pool was closed for cleaning. I only question the timing of this, as if it had been done earlier, it would have not cut into the morning as much as it did. There is only one towel station, and it is next to the beach. You need to give a room number and they write a ticket for the towels you take. THere is a $25 charge if you do not return the towel. Make sure to get your ticket back! You can also get a towel at the front desk, but only when the towel shack is not open. Not the best set-up. FOOD: There is one resturant on property. It is a small beach/poolside bar/resturant. The food was fine, basic and easy. My one MAJOR issue was the birds. There was bird poop all over the chairs. It was kind of gross. One night the woman working there told us we were not allowed to take food to go. We mentioned to the staff at the desk and they said they would address. The propert also has two gas grills you can reserve. We cooked steak one night. You have to reserve yout time at the front desk, and they give you the grilling tools. There are two grocery stores near the resort. One is in Dorado Central, called Supermax or something. The other is much closer, near a resturant called the Chop House. We only found the second one on the last day. It is closer to the resort, and everyone there spoke english. The Supermax was more of a drive through a busy area. The staff sent us to a couple of resturants. Villa De Alberto was good, but a little pricey. Sweet Ann's Cakes was a very good lunch spot. We also ate the the Chop House, which is a Hibachi style Asian resturant. There is a lot more variety in San Juan, but that is a bit of a trip. All in all we had a very good time at the resort. We even received a discount on golf at the Dorado Beach Resort as Hyatt guests. The biggest issue was the area around the Hyatt. It has a lot of fast food, and not a lot to do. If you are going to stay in, cook, and relax by the pool/beach, it is perfect. If you are looking for nice dinners, and night life, this is not really the spot. I do not hold this against the hotel, because it is not what we wanted. We were very happy with our trip. Would I go back? Not sure.

I have never written a review, but my experience was so bad, I felt compelled to alert other travelers of this hotel. I read all the reviews that I could before we headed to Dorado's Hyatt Hacienda Del Mar. This is also a TimeShare location for Marriott and other hotel chains. We go on big family trip through my parent's Time Share, so we don't get to choose the location or hotel. This was the MOST disappointing experience we have ever had. All those reviews that have a negative tone are RIGHT!! I have never been to a Time Share location that is in such poor condition. It looks FORGOTTEN and almost ABANDONED. No wonder all the hotel pictures on the website are taken at NIGHT!! Driving into the location, it looks completely under maintained. It was definitely the place to be, back in the day, but now it looks completely neglected and rundown. We all joked that is was like something out of the show LOST. There was this creepy presence of the deserted hotel next door that used to share the grounds and pools together. Now there is a big green fence separating the two. The amazing pools and giant water slide looked great, but now over grown and deserted it supplies a very eerie presence. FOOD: There was only one outdoor bar eatery, that was it. Had to rent a car to get groceries or eat out 99% of the time. Cabbing it was way TOO EXPENSIVE. ROOMS: are outdated, dirty, musty and moldy. We have small children (2 yrs, 4yrs.). We were horrified at the dust, mold, etc. It really made my skin crawl. Everyone (all 4 of us) developed a respiratory cough from the moldy A/C in our room. Had to sleep without any air to get some relief. There were holes in sheets and blankets. Not enough staff to clearly maintain hotel properly. AMENITIES: lounging and tableware is totally beat up and old looking. Pools were dirty and not cleaned, until some staff member threw in a ridiculous amount of chlorine in the morning, making the pool very cloudy and personally unusable. Jacuzzis were luke warm and the other one was broken the entire trip. The kids playground had been demolished from a storm and sat in a heap off to the side of the volleyball court with caution tape around it. They started to put it together the day before we left. There are no activities or kids club at the hotel. Tennis courts and mini- golf haven't been touched in years. The paint is chipping off of everything, it's really depressing looking. Staff is generally nice and lucky to have a job once the other hotel closed, so you feel bad. They mean well, but it should not be classified as a 4 star luxury resort. All the guests were very upset and mad about what was promised and what was delivered. A guest got her iphone stolen next to the hotel coffee machine at 7:30am after working out in the small hotel gym. This hotel has been acquired by a private company and it should not be considered a HYATT. It is at best 2 stars. IT seems to be the place to go if you are from Puerto Rico. At the end of our vacation. There were tons of locals checking in. Bringing all their laundry, bringing coolers to the pool, bringing there own radios to blast poolside. I did NOT feel like I was at a luxury resort, like it is advertised. It really ruined our trip and caused a great deal of stress. Positives: We had great weather (thank god), the beach is really nice. that's it! We would NEVER return to this Hotel. It was FALSE Advertising! Time Share Interval Award Winner 2010 displayed at the front desk made us all laugh, what a joke. Dorado the city is definitely on the upswing though. Beautiful beaches!

Great place to relax. Everything you need is a cab ride away.\u201d", "Author": "Dre35", "ReviewID": "UR91868411", "Content": "I have stayed here twice in the past year. This is a great place if you want a relaxing vacation (which is exactly what I was looking for). Many reviews talk about this place being secluded. I wouldn't describe it that way. However, you should know what this place is and what it is not. It is not near any thriving commercial areas. If you want to walk to a fantastic restaurant , you cannot. If you want to party all night and walk back to your hotel, this is not the place. All of those things can be had, but they are a cab ride away. First, the little bar/restaurant on the property can serve you food and drinks. The management of this little tiki bar has changed in the past year. I thought it was fantastic food with fantastic service PRIOR to the change. Now, the product and the service are decidedly subpar. But for a beer or 12, they do a good job. There is a restaurant and pub across the street which serves good food and drinks (run by the same people as the little tiki bar, but much better food and service, ironically). If you take a $10 cab ride into Dorado (about 5 minutes), you can choose from the restaurants and bars there. You must visit the Chophouse! Great food and great people that run the place. There are a couple of bars that are great fun on the weekends, but dead during the week (We watched Monday night football there and were literally the only people there). For more than that, you have to travel into San Juan, which is a $60 and 45 minute cab ride (one way). If you can, stay in San Juan for a night or two upon arrival or prior to leaving. That will allow you to do everything you want there without taking time during your stay in Dorado. This cabbing around might be a problem if it weren't for the cab drivers they have on call here. You can plan your day with these guys and they will be where they say they'll just show up wherever you are whenever you planned it. They are fantastic! (that ones for you, Felix!) I should also mention that the hotel staff has provided me with fantastic, above-the-call-of-duty type of service. If you need anything at all, they can--and will--help. Lastly, some reviewers are critical of the rooms. Yes, I too have stayed at many Hyatts across the country, and this was probably the lowest quality room of them all. However, I have also stayed at alot of limited service places around the country, and this is on par with the best of those. The beds are comfortable, the water is hot. And, oh yeah, its in a tropical paradise, so i'll happily take this over the Hyatt Regency in Minneapolis any day of February. All things considered, I think this is a great place to have a relaxing vacation, with all the dining/dancing/partying you want an arms length away.

My husband and I live in Puerto Rico and are constantly going on weekend getaways. This hotel is by far the BEST we have ever stayed in! We booked online and saved money as opposed to calling in and booking. We booked a studio and was given the 2nd floor. The view was obstructed with palm trees, but that only added to the peaceful and relaxing time we had, we could see the ocean through the trees, and it was pure bliss. The best part was the 24 hour pool and jacuzzi access, and the 24 hour beach access. It was as if we had the entire pool and beach to ourselves! The staff was amazing, friendly and very warm and welcoming, very eager to answer any questions we had. Shani (spelling) was amazing and went out of her way to make sure all my questions were answered, she was very friendly and always welcomed me with a smile and a \"Good Morning\".

This weekend was pure rest and relaxation and we loved it so much we decided to go back the following week (another review to follow with photos). This hotel is not good if you are looking for the party nightlife, it is in Dorado and there is not much to do outside the hotel at night. There are some places to go that are close by, there is Applebees restaurant, Starbucks, Sweet Anne Cakes, Wendy's, CVS, Walgreens, Pizza Hut, and a supermarket, as well as some other small stores.

The pool is open 24 hours and is large enough to have your own \"private section\" during the day. At night we enjoyed the entire pool all to ourselves!

Dorado is about 40 min. drive from San Juan. I would advice for most of you guys to rent a car. It's very easy to drive and there are so many diff. places to see. To go to El Yunque/ Luquillo, or to the coffee town (ponce) or to Guayate (rosted pig street), you'll have to drive from Dorado into San Juan and take express way (I wouldn't use regular road because of the traffic) that would then route to other cities. That add about 30 min to your time. Make sure you have have enough coins/ cash for tollways. The hotel was kind of hard to find even using GPS. We find the room was clean and the kitchen was well equiped. The hotel is old but not too old. The rooms are clean and the view was great. We stayed on the 5th floor which has a great view of the ocean and the pool area. The hotel next door is under renovation. We didn't find any loud noise that would disturb us in any way. The staff were nice and prompted with all of our requests. The bathrooms were clean. The kiddie pool was cloudy and dirty looking. The adult pool was fabulous. We spent most of the time in the adult pool and the beach. Nice beach, with lough chairs every where. It was not crowded at all. The location was great. It was down the street to a shopping strip (Applebees, popeyes, pizza hut) We didn't eat there since it was too american for us. We wanted more puerto rican so we would drive to San Juan or other cities for lunch and buy food for dinner. We also went to Amigo (Walmart owned) grocery store not too far from the hotel and bought some snack, beers, and grocery. Don't forget to buy some puerto rican coffee back... They are good and they sell them at Amigo. Found some nice souvernirs at Walgreens. We didn't have time to go to a proper souvenirs shop. Would definitely come back when the kids are bigger to do some real exploring of puerto rico. So, basically, if you're down with comfort, laid back, and no worries, this is the place. Little kids (mine are 5,2, 1) had fun here. I would just come here just for the beach.

Positive: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The personnel and the service was good from the moment that we arrive until the moment with check out. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The pool was a good place to relaxed and it was open 24 hours. They have 2 Jacuzzis, on pool for kids and the big Olympic pool. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind to have a kids running around the pool, you will enjoy the pool. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The room was clean and with everything they say it would have. I got the big room, with one king bed, full kitchen, 2 tv, one sofa bed, Jacuzzi, pool and beach view (floor 5). The would go and made room service every day, leaving new towels. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Free towels at the pool \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The food at the Beach Bohio was good and decent prices, they offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to buy food outside. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 For people that like playing Golf, Tennis, Basketball, Ping Pong and Beach Volleyball, they got good courts to do that. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 If you want a smoke free environment, this is the place for you. If you are a smoker don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother go there. Negative: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The hotel looks old, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a old hotel so, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a 5 star hotel view. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Only one security guard was harassing people by the pool. I know that the pool say no diving, but everyone was doing it so I took one dive and she went right directly to me in a bad mood saying that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no diving, I just ignored here and continue talking to my wife and she the guard keep stand by pool side expecting me to react to her, but from my side no reaction so she leave, then a few minutes after that I saw here stopping people walking to ask what the were doing, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from me is a red card for here, but beside that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153security guard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the rest of the personnel was good. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The Beach Bohio (the rest.) closed around 8:00 pm (the kitchen) and the bar closed around 8:30 pm, they should be open until 10:30pm kitchen and the bar until 11:00pm at least. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The hotel by the side the former Cerro Mar Beach Hotel is closed and makes the Hyatt Hacienda del Mar looks a little bit uglier than really is. I ask about what are the plans for the hotel and they really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Free parking, but the parking near the golf course is deteriorated Beside those things, I would recommend this hotel for people that just want to relax in a place near the beach with pool 24 hours, near of shopping malls, restaurants, movies theater and other amenities that the town of Dorado has to offer, about 25 minutes from a San Juan, I thinks this would be the place for you, but if you are looking for a Party mode hotel or expecting the 5 star hotel, you should search another place.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointed!

Upon arriving in Puerto Rico we checked our voicemail to hear that our booked accommodation was \"no longer available\"...and they recommended we check out the Hyatt. We called the Hyatt from the airport to see if there was any availability, and they said that they did and miraculously it was in our budget. We immediately made our reservation and made our way to the car rental so we could get checked in as soon as possible. Here we are, one week later, completely dissapointed with our stay. Every day there has been someone knocking down our door at 9am, asking when we're leaving. One morning my husband answered the front door to find 3 men in the breezeway, demanding to know why he was not answering the phone, which had been ringing off the hook the entire time he was in the shower. Confused, he said he would be right down, only to learn that he had neglected to sign part of the paperwork. The front desk staff has treated us one of two ways: like we're criminals, with complete suspicion, or simply with indifference. On our second day in PR we found out our checking acct had been compromised and drained. We came up with an alternative payment method, and while we were explaining the situation and offering a new payment method, we were locked out of our room and ignored for close to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, they have my credit card and are not speaking to me? When they give it back, they don't say anything and continue to ignore us standing there. After another few minutes somebody looks at us accusingly and says \"Can I help you?\". \"Yes, we need our keys reprogrammed so we can get into our room.\" The woman then checks with 4 managers to make sure it's ok to let us in. We completely understand collateral needed, but what made our day worse (after finding out our checking account was empty) was being treated poorly while trying to remain communicative with the staff and openly offering another form of payment. The property itself now has no restaurant on site, features a dirty beach, an abandoned property, and our one bedroom suite smells musty. Our expectations for Hyatt have been completely quashed and we're currently considering moving our flight up so we won't have to deal with the daily disappointments. We've found Dorado to be equally disappointing, with local restaurants being unvelievably overpriced and the service poor. We've been eating in for the last 5 days because we almost feel like we're a burden to the residents of the area...although we've made every effort to be friendly and are speaking Spanish.

The advantage is that you are an easy ride from the central Puerto Rico attractions (caves, Arecibo, north coast beaches). You can also get into Old San Juan by taking the exit to the ferry off of toll road A22 ($1 toll). If you want to drive into Old San Juan, there are parking garages straight ahead as you enter the city (about $7). If you turn to the right (up the hill to the fort) you should circle around to municipal parking ($1.50 for 4 hours). Avoid parking up the hill as it is very challenging. Some of the reviews for the Hyatt were not too positive, however, we decided to go with the positive reviews and are glad we did. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We requested early check in and late checkout and they allowed both requests. There is an elevator in each of the two buildings and free wifi in the room (slow in the AM, better in the PM). There are two terminals off the lobby for guest use and these are much faster. The only problem I had was SKYPE was great as long as you turned your camera off. Otherwise, the throughput wasn't high enough to support webcam and voice for more than a few minutes. We had a 1 bedroom on the second floor. The view was of the pool and partial ocean which was very good, but next time we would request a higher floor to see more of the ocean. The rooms were very large and extremely comfortable. The bedroom has a TV and a balcony with table, chairs, and drying rack. It is adjacent to the whirlpool tub and bathroom sink with a long vanity and the closet that also holds the safe. There is a separate bathroom with another vanity sink, hair dryer, toilet, and shower that can be accessed from the bedroom or the full kitchen. The living room is very large and has a flat screen TV, DVD player, stereo, and a sofa that is also a bed. There is also a dining room table and chairs, and a large picture window. The kitchen is full sized with all the standard appliances and a counter with two stools. The outside alcove entrance has a stackable washer/dryer and under the sink is laundry and dishwasher detergent provided at no charge. The appliances consist of an electric stove, refrigerator/freezer, over the range microwave, toaster (faster than the one we have at home), and blender. There is a full compliment of pots, pans, dishes and silverware that we dishwashed every two days. The washer/dryer is shared with the adjoining studio and makes packing a breeze when you know you can wash your clothes on a regular basis. If you rent a two bedroom, you get the studio as your second bedroom and it has it's own bathroom and kitchenette. The pool is very large and very clean with many lounge chairs and some tables and umbrellas. It is nicely landscaped and the staff keeps the area very clean. The beach is very nice with many lounge chairs and large permanent umbrella shelters. The beach closest to the hotel can be rough when the tide comes in, but if you walk to your right toward the adjacent closed hotel, the ocean is very calm just before the spectacular rocks at the end. The closed hotel is fenced off by a green fence and is not an eyesore as was made out to be in previous reports. We were told that it was going to be torn down and a new Fairmont resort was going to be built on the site.

There is a small tiki bar that you can get sandwiches and a few drinks unfortunately it's not open all the time, closes down around 6:00pm. The food was very good though. The workout room was clean and had fairly new equipment, and also not busy. The pool was very nice, water was refreshing-not too hot and not too cold. The rooms were a bit outdated but was easily overlooked as the location is fantastic.

The weather was absolutely perfect and that saved the day for us. Here are lists of positives and negatives we discovered: On the plus side..... - nice, private beach - good pool - fitness center is pretty large - decent equipment in fitness center- mostly LifeFitness brand. Good ellipticals. - weather was perfect (70s at night, sunny with 83-84 every day) - nice couple of hot tubs - Tennis courts and golf - Free wi-fi Now the problems..... - We were in a studio, which for every other HVC property is more than large enough for us. This was the size of a hotel room, with a microwave and mini-fridge wedged in to make up the 'kitchen'. No storage for non-refrigerated food, silverware and utensils wre stored in a jar of some sort. - Bad impression driving up.... the facility next door that was supposed to be torn down months ago is still there and that's right in front of you as you enter the grounds. - Our room (6th floor) actually was oriented toward the decrepit propery next door, so we got a great view of an empty hotel and its un-maintained grounds. - It's pretty far from the airport, so you almost have to rent a car. That's actually necessary, since there are no restaurants on the grounds other than the grill that's open a few hours a day next to the pool. - Not much to see nearby. although if you drive back to San Juan there are a few good attractions there. - We weren't aware of this and don't think it's the same at other HVC sites, but there was no housekeeping whatsoever. We had to take out our own trash, fetch our own towels when we needed them. Not a big deal, but very unexpected. - No desk in the room, so my PC needed to share a small table that was also used for eating. - No 'lazy river', which would have been excellent at this property. There was no variety in the swimming choices- one pool was it. All-in-all, we'll probably return next February based on the great weather we experienced.

Club\u201d", "Author": "quinttank", "ReviewID": "UR46865296", "Content": "I will give you the low-down on this from two sides. The first side is if you are accustomed to staying in other Hyatt vacation club (HVC) properties. If this is the case then this is not like any of the others. 1) Not as well kept. 2) NO activities or any useful guidance on things to do. 3) Not really close to anything (except for some very nice golf courses). 4) Most of the visitors on the weekend were locals....like 80% of the people in the place. We were there Thursday to Monday. On Friday hardly anyone was there and most of them looked to be owners or guests of the HVC.....Saturday was like the scene in the movie caddyshack (where they open the pool up for the caddies). The parking lot filled up, and locals will park three wide if there is room. Other than those things mentioned it does have a nice pool and a great (but rough) secluded private beach. If you are not accustomed to the Hyatt Vacation Club resorts you will find this adequate for stays near Dorado. I do not know what the prices are but I would pay around $75 to $100 a night for a place like this. Now for the three hundred pound gorilla in the room....What made this place so strange is the abandon Hotel and casino right next to it...(literally 6 feet from it). Folks...I would be shocked if this hotel is ever used again. I took some photos of it and looked at them when I got home...the hotel is in really bad shape. It is wide open and rusted to the point that the structural decay is past the price point of refurbishment. They have constructed a 8 foot fence with green material over it to hide the decay of the old hotel...for me it just made curious about what exactly happened or is planned. That is where I started noticing very different stories on what the plan is (from staff and locals). I believe they (Hyatt) lost a boat load of money in the casino and got out to stop the bleeding. The abandon hotel is very big and obscures your view from certain parts of the Del Mar property. Our room had a real nice view of the old hotel, and if we went to the balcony we could look left and see the ocean. I would take either a ground level room or something above 5th or 6th floor if you want a shot at good view. There is nothing to do or eat on the property. They have a little bar out by the beach that serves $6.50 beers and $7 drinks along with some mall food. You MUST have a car at this property. Driving in Puerto Rico is god awful. I was scared for my life several times...and I can drive. I have been to Jamaica, Cayman Islands....Texas, and have never seen stupid driving like this. The roads don't have lines on them and locals will just drive like idiots.....seriously when you get there look at how many of the cars have dents and dings. I was amazed at the poor roads and bad driving...I felt like I was in a third world country. We never found a good place to eat. The Pika place up the road was average and the drink prices were insane. Right before we left a local told me that the El Captain was great...never made it there. Sweet ann cakes is good and the Wendy's right next to it is just like home. I played the plantation courses (Surgercane & Pineapple) while I was there, and they were OK. For the price I would have expected GPS in the cart. The funny thing about those two course was that they were marginallly maintained and there were no hole layouts on the tee signs or the scorecard. I hit through some doglegs I just didn't know where there. So in short...Del Mar is the worst HVC property we have been to by far...

You can get very good deals through e.g. hotwire.com, so it shouldn't be a huge expense to have a car. The reason is that Hyatt Dorado not within walking distance from any shop, attraction, facility. Hyatt Dorado is approx. 45 min (no traffic jams) from San Juan International Airport. The hotel is very nice and peaceful. The rooms are fine and large enough. All rooms have view towards the sea. The rooms are clean and spacious. We had a standard room. It included a fridge, which came in very handy. Room is cleaned every day. We paid 99 US dollars. Parking is free.

And lots of space to find a quiet place in the sun or shadow at the wonderful beach. This is so peaceful! Whether you sleep till 9am or 11am, you can be assured that there are plenty of lounge chairs waiting for you. What a difference with several other hotels.

Resort has some shortfalls that were a little surprising from a Hyatt. 1 Bedroom unit was nice and fairly well equipped. There were a couple design flaws that were a nuisance throughout my stay. First of all, there were food odors from other units coming through the A/C vents. It smelled like someone was cooking right in my kitchen. The toilet system is a vacuum system used quite frequently these days, but I could hear toilets upstairs, downstairs, next door, two floors up and down and further away. It was constant. And finally (in relation to the room) the faucets were aggravating as heck. They were these high powered stream type faucets. When you turn on the water, the force of these little high powered streams of water would hit the basin and by the time you were finished, you had water all over the entire sink and floor area and yourself for that matter. This sounds like a ridiculous complaint, but you had to see it, to believe it. OK, now on to the rest of the resort. Can't complain about the location of the resort because I knew about it before hand. Resort is isolated but also on a nice stretch of beach. The closed down resort next door is definitely an eyesore. They say the resort along with the river pool is under construction, but that isn't the case. No one is doing any work there at all. The beach palapa's are falling apart. I think Hyatt's biggest failure is that there is no real restaurant on location. The one place that serves food (hot dogs and hamburgers) and drinks is only open from lunch time to 6pm. The drinks are very expensive and even got ripped off by a bartender who was making 1 drink for me, when a second person approached and wanted the same drink, so the bartender added only more ice and poured the drink into 2 glasses. So I paid 8$ for a drink that only had half the amount of ingredients it was supposed to have. There is no music, happy hour, entertainment or anything that gives you that Caribbean Resort feel. All of the staff was great, which includes the Resort Manager Ivan who was assisting me with an ongoing problem with my purchase of a 4 day internet plan through Freedom Wireless. Took me 3 months to get it resolved and Ivan continued to offer assistance. I was told they have a new internet provider, but I would recommend that you not buy the internet plan if Freedom Wireless is still running it. All of the food on the island is great, but one restaurant was so good, I went back there again, is Restaurant El Capitan. It is in downtown Dorado. If you were coming from the Hyatt, when you get to the town of Dorado it is one block away from the main road on the right hand side in a little side neighborhood. (This street runs parallel to the main street) I tried to find an address that I could post, but can't locate one. This restaurant is only open from Thursday to Sunday.

To me this is a great resort if you are looking for a relaxing getaway. If you are looking for a party resort with a jumping nightlife this is not the place for you. Below are our thoughts on the different aspects of the resort Room: We stayed in the one bedroom unit and found it to be very nice. It had a full kitchen, living room, and seprate bedroom. In the bathroom was a seperate shower and whirlpool tub. We recieved daily maid service were they made the beds and changed the towels and one deep cleaning of the room during our week stay there. As stated in previous reviews the beds were a liitle on the firm side, but nothing that was going to keep you from getting a good nights sleep. Beach: The resort sits on a lovely private beach that is in a cove of the ocean. Getting chairs on the beach was never a problem no matter what time of day we went down. This was probably the highlight of the resort. Pool: Just a standard lap pool, nothing too exciting, along with two whirlpools and a kiddie wading pool with plenty of more chairs around them. The pools were very clean and we could see staff cleaning them every day. Grounds and Acitivities: Beautiful grounds that were cleaned and manicured every day. There was an onsite resturant the served lunch and drinks from 11am-6pm, and the front desk has many menus for resturants in the area for dinner. The acitivites that we saw were: beach volleyball, basketball, tennis, mini-golf, table tennis, and four beautiful golf courses. The basketball court, tennis court, and mini-golf were all lighted for night time play. Hyatt Cerromar: As stated in previous reviews the Hyatt Cerromar next door is closed. The casino, river pool, water slide, and all resturants that were part of this resort are closed as well. If you have fond memories of this resort when it was open, you will probably be disappointed. As also stated in previous reviews there is now a green fence surrounding the entire Cerromar property, but this is only an issue if you make it one.

The rooms were large and nicely decorated, and the kitchen better outfitted than I had expected. Plenty of towels, etc. The washer dryer was helpful, too. The beds are a bit firm- we were all complaining of stiff backs by the end of the week, but the hot tub took care of that. The resort is smallish, very quiet and peaceful, and beautiful. Notice that I didn't say \"exciting\"- exciting it's not. There is little to do on the resort except laze in the sun and drink Pina Coladas. Which I like to do, so I was pretty well set. The pool is big and very well maintained. The beach is small but very nice- plenty of beach chairs. NIce shady areas as well as sunny ones. The fact that the hotel next door is closed really doesn't impact at all (except that there was probably more to do when it was open). That will definitely change when they start demolition and reconstruction, but who know when that will be?- years, probably, at least. The only food on site is the pool/beach bar which has an extremely limited menu. The on site shop does sell a decent array of \"basics\", and there are grocery stores nearby (though we found the quality of fresh food to be significantly lower than what we are used to at home) Dorado is a sleepy-ish area, but there are plenty of good dining options within a few miles. You will definitely, by the way, need a car. We liked Morado (I think that's what it was called), to the east of the resort. It's high end- pricey, but excellent food and excellent service. There are several other restaurants in that little strip that we did not get to try. There are several low-key, very Puerto Rican restaurants clustered around Dorado Beach (the public beach- not the resort called Dorado Beach). And we went to Charlie-Hamburger (funny name) a couple of times - very casual, very cheap. The mofongo was pretty much the same at all the places that we had it in Dorado, and all of it was good. There are fast food restaurant EVERYWHERE! Never have I seen so many Burger Kings in one place. There's also an Applebee's just down the road from the resort- AVOID IT! It was god-awful.

We have just finished a delightful one-week stay at the Hyatt Hacienda in Dorado and can find no fault what so ever with the resort. We flew into San Juan (an easy flight from New York) and rented a car. The drive took about 30 minutes. I highly recommend that anyone vacationing in Dorado rent a car. We brought our GPS, which was a big help. The hotel is actually a time-share condominium complex, which probably explains the layout (identical two bedroom condos, which can be divided and all face the ocean), the amenities and the generally quiet and comfortable atmosphere. Our 4th floor condo was a roomy two bed room, two bath unit with a full kitchen, dining and living room, 2 balconies overlooking the pool and ocean and full laundry facilities. We had maid service daily. Everything was extremely clean. Our first day there we ran into a fellow physician from our home town who, as it turns out, bought a time share there when the complex was first built. He has been delighted with the purchase and relieved that the Hyatt next door has closed, keeping thousands of people off the beach and pool area (both very clean during our stay). Contrary to reviews, we were basically unaware of the fencing between our property and that of the hotel next door\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit was covered with unobtrusive green canvas and hundreds of palm trees. Every unit looks out over the pool area and ocean. The pool was large and had swimming lanes so my husband and I could swim our laps every day. The beach is on a horseshoe-shaped cove, which totally prevented trespassers from entering. The entire property is gated and well secured with guards, so we felt very safe. Unlike the experience at most beaches in Puerto Rico, we were never hassled by vendors or beggars. We played tennis on one of their many courts, two of which were lit at night, but did not play golf. There was also a miniature golf course, ping-pong tables and a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s program. The majority of the people there were families (more than 1/2 speaking English). The staff was polite, bilingual, helpful and thoroughly appropriate. Overall, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say it was an ideal vacation week for our family of four (2 teenagers, 2 adults), but quiet. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to the Hyatt expecting an active nightlife. There are several good restaurants in the area, but no casino as far as we were aware. We ate out every night, but the kitchen was well supplied with cooking utensils and one could easily cook dinner in the unit. There are two good supermarkets within easy driving distance of the hotel and lots of American style restaurants in addition to the local.

It is enclosed by two huge boulders of rocks so you know that it's not open to the public. They have nice chairs that you can use and you dont have to be charged to use them. You can get a nice cold drink at the restaurant and just enjoy the sun. They provide you with towels but you just have to make sure you return them.. that's pretty typical for the most part. Thirdly, the staff are great! We checked in fast and they were very helpful to give us directions and recommendations on places to go. There's not much stuff in Dorado but if you're going out to eat, I recommend the \"La Terrazza\" for dinner. As for tours, they have them available in the resort but I suggest that you rent a car.

If you decide to go to the Bacardi Distillery, just plan on going to Old San Juan from there because there's a ferry close to the Bacardi place that goes to Old San Juan for 50 cents one way ($1 back and forth).

First, make sure you do not lose your bracelets that they give you as you will be charged $15 if they are not returned. They are the same type of rubber bracelets that you can pay $3 to \"Livestrong\". I'm guessing they are reusing these, which is kind of gross.

It is awful- and I live in Atlanta so that is saying a lot. People drive anyway and anywhere they want. We saw several ambulances with flashing lights and no one pulled over. Just a warning to be aware of the drivers and expect people to drive in between lanes and along the shoulder. If you want to go to the east side of the island -Fajardo, El Yunque - it will take you a good hour and 45 to get there. We were not anticipating this. Traffic around San Juan is bad at all times. We were planning on taking the ferry to Culebra one day and the girls at the front desk told us that we should plan on leaving at 4:00 am in order to make sure that we get there in time to get ferry tickets.

We have been to the location five times before over the past 23 years and have always enjoyed it. Our first visit was in 1985 at the end of our honeymoon, then in 1989 with our then 2 year old, again in 1992 with our then 5 year old (leaving an infant at home) and then in 2001 with our 14, 9 & 6 year olds. My husband bought this week in a 2 bedroom timeshare at a school auction, overbidding significantly with memories of all those wonderful vacations past. Then we started to read the reviews...the adjacent Hyatt hotels on the property were closed, the river pool closed and we started to really worry. Were we off to some abandoned hotel site??? When we arrived we were very disappointed to see the 9 foot chain link fencing and the empty, abandoned river pool. Not only was it spooky but it was very sad, with all our memories! Since this was potentially our last big family vacation now that our kids are 20, 15, & 12 we swallowed hard and decided to make the best of it. So we went ahead and despite all the negatives we had a great week. First of all our two bedroom unit on the fifth floor was all recently renovated, new appliances, new sofa bed, very clean and with a beautiful view of the ocean (although also a view of the abandoned hotel). The one remaining pool that was open was nice and the beach was very pleasant. I did prefer the pool and the lagoon at the adjacent Dorado Beach Club (the former Hyatt Dorado Beach which is also closed) which guests at the Hacienda del mar are also allowed to use. While we were there the surf was very rough for 2-3 days due to a storm out at sea so the beach was closed for swimming. The waves however were amazing!!! The food at both locations was significantly limited, really only the beach bohios at each location. The burgers at the Dorado Beach club were fantastic although expensive $11. We bought groceries and beer as well as cases of water at the \"Amigo\" so we did have breakfast and snacks in our unit. During the week we ate dinner at the Hacienda del Sol (which was way overpriced and not very good), the Trattoria de Nanda (twice which was pretty good), Applebees and La Terraza, all in Dorado. The best thing about the resort is the golf courses. My husband and two sons played both the Plantation course and the famous Dorado East 6 of 7 days and again although expensive they had an awesome time! In the end it was a great vacation and we are considering buying into this timeshare resort since it has so many memories for us. One very important factor, you must rent a car since the cabs are way overpriced and you do have to drive to restaurants, to the grocery store, to the golf course (which is adjacent but the clubhouse is at least a mile away) not to mention to the airport.

And in the last night, we had very noisy people above us; constant slamming of doors, you could almost hear every word they said. But other than that: beautiful.

Did not try any of the on-site restaurants other than the Zen (pool restaurant), since with 2 small kids you do a lot of stuff in your kitchen. The various pools (I count at least 5 + one river you can float down + under waterfalls) are fantastic, there is something for everyone from toddler to adult. The beach is a large bay with a reef breaking the (sometimes) large waves. For small children you go to the east end where there are almost no waves. Very clean water, nice sand, perfect. Staff was exceptionally friendly; helped us find a pediatrician very quickly. And - the resort feels half empty. You always wonder where all the people went. It's perfect. No fighting for chairs etc. There a few times when we were more than 25 people at the beach.

The golf courses in Dorado are gorgeous. My husband took our son to play 18 holes at the Plantation Golf Course and had a blast. OK- let's get to the Cerromar being closed.

Went with a couple friends. Had hoped to stay at the Westin (which I will do next time!) but they were booked during the time we were there. So, we booked the two bedroom at the Hyatt which certainly gave us a good amount of space. We had held rooms at the Hyatt and at the El Conquistador . I had sent the El Con an email and called looking for clarifications and answers to the concerns listed in Trip Advisor reviews and received no response. In addition, the value of a two bedroom with kitchen and living room at the Hyatt (with questionable reviews) versus the single room at the El Con (also with questionable reviews) for the same price helped us make our decision. The Hyatt was responsive to my questions. I believed they were thorough and truthful in the information they gave us prior to our arrival. In addition, they called us prior to our arrival asking if we needed transportation from the airport to the Hyatt, which we did not. I strongly recommend renting a car if staying at the Hyatt as there is not much to do on sight except sit on the beach or near the pool or play golf. Each time upon entering our room (5309 and 5310) we could smell that the room was musty/moldy. After being in the room a while the smell became less noticeable. (Not sure that is a good thing!) Clearly the tropical location makes it difficult to keep moisture out of rooms but it is something that needs to be addressed. In addition, the room d\u00c3\u00a9cor and bedding definitely need to be updated. The Zen restaurant located in the now closed Cerromar hotel was good. We also ordered salads from the beach bar, which were fine. Beyond that, we ate breakfast in our room and most other meals off of the resort property. A Grande grocery store in nearby Dorado was a good spot to purchase items to stock up the fridge. The Hyatt Hacienda beach was nice. The beach is well located with a nice wind (sometimes very strong!) to keep sunbathers cool. Waves can get large and strong, so use caution with young children on the beach. A nice large sand area allows for beach activities. The pool areas, while in need of updating and some additional normal upkeep, were decent as well. Due to the vacated property next door and the limited amount of people staying at the Hyatt, there was no shortage of beach chairs. While I see some guests were unhappy with the staff/service, we did not have any complaints about the staff. We felt housekeeping did a good job cleaning the rooms with what they had to work with. In addition, the front desk was helpful in a number of ways including a stack of printed directions to tourist attractions and a large book of menus for area restaurants that they recommend. I had a service at the spa and found it to be nice. While there are certainly much more luxurious spas, this was pretty good considering the situation of the property. The adjacent property of the former Hyatt Cerromar Hotel is in disrepair. A close look (well not even that close!) at the building and grounds shows deterioration and mold. This situation does not help the Hacienda del Mar status at all. Hyatt had distributed a letter to Vacation Club owners updating them on the situation of the property. Apparently the Hyatt Vacation club had tried to purchase the adjacent former Hyatt Cerromar hotel but the owner of the property is now in negotiations with someone else. The Hacienda del Mar does a good job of keeping the grounds up. I have attached photos of the beach and pool areas. I realize I forgot to take pics inside the room, but the web site photos of the room are fairly comparable to the current state of the rooms. I am a rather picky hotel guest and prefer much more luxurious and more updated accommodations. I would be likely not to stay here again unless the property underwent upgrades. I am surprised that Hyatt has not done so as of yet.

THis allowed us to actually have a life after they went to sleep at 8 pm. The full kitchen meant we could cook whatever meals we wanted. The best part was that the resort was nearly deserted. We had a first-class resort practically to ourselves. I can also say that the beach at the Hyatt Dorado (less than five miles up the road and completely open to anyone staying at the Hacienda del mar) is hands-down the best beaches I've ever seen. It's particularly great for kids since it's like a giant salt-water swimming pool. Sure the casino and several restaurants were close, but we could have cared less.

For those who want nightlife and a casino, I would go somewhere else. For anyone else who want to have a world-class resort all to themselves, run down to the Dorado complex and stay at the Hacienda. I didn;t even mention the amazing river pool and what fun that was. Plus, the Asian restaurant and poolside restaurants were quite good.", "Date": "February 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cA small taste of paradise\u201d", "Author": "Mynah24", "ReviewID": "UR6139113", "Content": "During a family trip to Puerto Rico, we needed a place that would accommodate three people comfortable, as I was traveling with my dad, and my adult nephew who had never been to the island before. We were coming in on the Western tip of the island, but needed a place near San Juan to spend a couple of days. Everything in the city seemed to be either too expensive or not quite the 'resort'-like atmosphere we were after. I found the Hyatt Hacienda Del Mar via various internet searches and was intrigued by the photos and was sold on the great price we got for one full room that would include a full kitchen, sofabed, separate bedroom, and a beach and pool atmosphere. The reviews for the place seemed to be pretty positive, so I booked two nights, and then started looking up everything there was to read about it on the web and in guide books...and started to panic. Apparently the Hyatt properties in Dorado were once spectacular locations, but one of the properties closed down merely months ago, and this one became time share condos! I was worried that the resort would not live up to our expectations, especially since I was not looking into getting into timeshares. I feared long parts of our day being lost to presentations. I almost rebooked the entire thing, but I would keep reading and looking at photos and everyone seemed to really love this place. I called the hotel to be sure it was still in operation, and hoped that it would be what we wanted. My fears were at first relieved when I received a courtesy reminder call about my pending stay --- totally unexpectedly. I could tell by this that our choice was still a first class resort. We drove from Aguadilla P.R. to Dorado in a little less than 2 hours (we took the scenic route), following the directions given to us on the hotel site and otherwise. In the one negative comment I have about the place, the directions were not all that clear. We wound up circling the area in Dorado, winding up near quiet fields that were no where near a beach, thanks to signposts that were not exactly clear. They read something like, go straight on 693, turn on 696, then turn on 693...? Not fun to do when you're driving around for the first time in a strange town. Plus, the Hyatt has not changed the name yet - it still reads \"Hotel Cerromar\" - which is very confusing when you turn in looking for one thing and see another. When we eventually found the place, we were thrilled. The staff greeted us courteously, smiling, and made us feel welcome immediately. I'm not sure if our arrival (mid week in November) was during off-season or not -- but the place seemed extremely empty! We checked into a huge room that was even larger than I expected, and marvelled at all the little extra touches. TV's in the bedroom as well as the livingroom. A small terrace area overlooking the beach and pool, and a very very large bed. We had wanted two beds, but the cost of a two bedroom would have been much higher. We made the most of what we had, and it was big enough to suffice our small family, only suffering mild discomfort. When we went to explore the beach and pool area, our jaws dropped. The beach was gorgeous. And empty. And better yet - totally private. A lovely view of the ocean surrounded by beachfront is all you see. Nothing more or less. It was beautiful. And the pools were actually a mini-water park! A dozen or so bodies of water all attached via mini-slides. You could use a tube and just ride through a bit and then slide into the next pool, or just do it yourself. Though designed for families, big kids (like my nephew and I) had a complete blast, especially when we discovered small hidden areas (an underwater cave). Again, since we were here on off-season, we had the run of the place almost entirely to ourselves! We were given a voucher to try one of the hotel restaurants (Zen Garden), which we enjoyed immensely -- even my dad who hates Chinese food enjoyed his meal. There were a couple of other eateries here, but due to the renovation and closure of the other Hyatt, shuttles were available to take guests without cars between resorts. The resort is located about 1/2 hour drive away from San Juan. Figure in a bit more for traffic during peak hours. We found a great selection of nearby stores to shop at, had we stayed here for the entire week. A huge supermarket, some additional restaurants, and banks and bakeries are all minutes away from the resort. My dad commented frequently that he felt he was in Florida, not in Puerto Rico. Our stay was short, but we do hope to return here for longer stays some day. There seems to be a management change in progress, so hopefully this place will still be around when we choose to go back. It was truly a small taste of paradise, for a really great price. As for the Timeshare- they do leave messages with you to see their presentations, but they were not agressive about it, and were really looking for couples and families, of which we were not. However, if I were looking for such a deal, i certainly would look into it at this wonderful resort.", "Date": "November 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful, relaxing and beautiful\u201d", "Author": "phenderson", "ReviewID": "UR6019175", "Content": "I just returned from a five-night stay at the Hacienda Del Mar. I was quite concerned as the sister hotels, Dorado Beach and Cerromar Beach, are now closed, as is the casino and many of the restaurants on these properties. Many reviews were quite negative; however, we found the Hacienda Del Mar to be quite comfortable and still beautiful and the people went out of their way to please us. The pools, especially the river pool, were well maintained as was the beach. The only thing missing was the crowds. Local restaurants fulfilled our needs, but the best restaurant of all was the onsite Zen Garden. The owner, Sam, befriended us and we ate there 3 nights out of 5. The food was EXCELLENT. Sam even prepared a special dinner on our last night just for our group of 6. The theme is Asian, but you still have many choices. First night we ate habachi, second night we ate the 4 course lobster special, and the last night we had our surprise dinner prepared especially for us. The main cocktail lounge is open as is the pool bar/restaurant and the service was outstanding.

The rest of the resort is in severe disarray. Roofs caving inn , bathrooms uncleaned , recrational activites closed down, etc.etc...

Hyatt has the lion's share of the beach property at Dorado with its three facilities which are available to all resort guests. The grounds are impeccable and the golf courses are fantastic. We want to especially complement the professionalism and skill of the front desk , spa and beach staff . They were extremely polite and helpful, and they will go out of their way to please guests. In every way, they exhibited the high standard for which Hyatt is well known. It is readily obvious that this resort was once the Grand Dame of the island. That being said, we must acknowledge that the resort has fallen on hard times from what appears to be poor property management and intentional neglect from the Hyatt corporate structure. Presently the abandoned, mammoth Dorado Beach Hotel is an eyesore to say the least, and it, along with its rusting roof, is in plain view of the oceanfront condominiums. I was advised by the resort staff that Hyatt intends to begin renovation work on the hotel later this year and intends to complete the project by the end of next year. Get real, Hyatt, this massive undertaking will take at least three years, since the hotel is only one of the many structural problems on the resort. Other buildings, which are not few in number, are also rusting and in need of serious renovation. Even the condos need upgrading with regard to rusting and peeling paint from the walls, fading draperies, peeling paint from porch furniture, an infestation of miniature ants on the balcony upon our arrival, and dirty showerheads to say the least. The miniature ants were also around the pool property. While many of the restaurants are now closed at the resort, the Zen Restaurant is still open for business. We found the food there to lack presentation as well as good taste for such a pricey establishment. We were grateful that we had rented a vehicle, so we could travel to other upscale restaurants. One other point which we noted and hope was not intentional was that the maid service was inconsistent in how they cleaned our rooms, in that they decreased the service the last two nights of our stay--tacky, tacky, Hyatt! Hopefully in time Hyatt will be able to restore the rare beauty that the resort was known for in years past.
