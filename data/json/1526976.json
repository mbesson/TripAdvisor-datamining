The rooms were nice as the high ceilings definitely provided a different feeling from a standard hotel room. The lounge area in the lobby had a pool table and plenty of seating. The \"pantry\" in the lobby provided a place to buy small food and drink items in case you did not want the full restaurant experience or just needed something quick. Unfortunately, a large group of young people showed up after my first night for some kind of film event. The hotel was crawling with young people with camera and lighting equipment. I was ok with that but things got noisy and crowded at night. The lounge was unusable after there arrival. I even got a flier under my door reminding me of quiet times and minimum ages to roam free. I felt like I had landed at a Spring Break hotel. Parking was in the adjoining parking lot. My only complaint here is that you park, check in, then have to go back to your car to put the tag on the mirror.

I had a superb time from check in at the Aloha desk with Reagan who greeted me warmly and was up on the happenings for the weekend in the Big D. Thomas also at the Aloha desk was most helpful with the jack hookups and friendly. I had a wonderful room with view of the bronze longhorns and appreciated the design from the rocking retro chairs and plexiglass faux tree trunk coffee table to the sumptuous bed, Bliss toiletries, and efficient use of space. I also loved the jack set up and connection to the TV which was so unique as I have been to many 5 star hotels that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the feature. Splash was refreshing and Refuel was an oasis. I would like to especially thank Gil who was a most cheerful and accommodating individual who knows how to anticipate needs. There was a turkey club sandwich that I wanted but it had bacon. He prepared a fresh sandwich for me without bacon and was able to substitute a small salad instead of potato chips thanks to Jesse at the Aloha desk who was so gracious and hospitable. I returned to my room thinking I should have told Gil to heat up the sandwich since there was cheddar cheese and the melted cheese would be so tasty. When I took the sandwich out of the wrapping foil it was heated. I went back to thank Gil and bought a grain bar which he freshly prepared as well and it was piping hot. Gil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attentiveness and taking time for the little things that make me happy was just dandy! I finished my stay and checked out with Thomas. Again a fitting end to great weekend.

There is always a nice gym with up to date elliptical and treadmill equipment, and there is always a cool bar area. What set this Aloft apart was the location in Downtown Dallas in an old brick building full of character. Check in was easy, and the staff noted my platinum status and said I would be in an upgraded room. I was not sure what to expect, since I thought pretty much all the Aloft rooms were alike, and I had never received any sort of upgrade in one. As soon as I walked in the room I saw what he meant- the room was huge, easily twice the size of the Aloft rooms I am used to, with exposed brick walls and floor to ceiling windows on one side. The room had the usual wall mounted flat screen tv and a box on the desk that enabled you to hook up a computer or game unit to the tv, a safe, free bottled water and coffee, and the usual walk in shower with Bliss amenities. The only downside of the room was that a marathon was being held Sunday morning, so I woke up at 6 am to loud music and a big crowd out front of my room, which faced the convention center. Given the marathon crowd, I grabbed breakfast in the lobby and enjoyed a ham egg and cheese sandwich for $3, with free coffee. Overall, a great experience.

Free bottled water. Cheap parking. Nice staff. Nice products. Huge, clean room. Nice cozy bed. They even threw in a $10 comp in food! So basically, parking, or the food, was \"free\". The places I am used to, you have to pay $29+ for parking EACH NIGHT and all you get is a bad parking space. This place charged me $10 and gave me breakfast! Love the look and feel of this hotel. If this room was in California, it would be over $200/night. Huge window that opens to the city. A real shower with a real shower head! Ironing board. Fridge. Coffee. Free WiFi! Huge flat screen TV that pretty much stares at you from the center of the room with a \"watch me\" look on its face. I did watch it and I normally do not watch TV in hotels. Very quiet other than the outside, city noise. Noise downtown? I like it. Hustle and bustle. A nice area to walk around, across the street. Some sort of buffalo exhibit or something. I decided against crossing the street to check it out, but it LOOKED cool from a distance. Didn't see much else other than a McDonald's nearby. Loved the layout of the room. When I walked in, I thought they had upgraded me to a suite. I was on the 7th floor. Did not use the gym, but I checked it out. It had decent cardio machines. Lighting was fantastic throughout the property. Really young, hip, friendly staff. VERY convenient, no hassle parking. Only had a few problems: I asked for an 8:30am wake-up call, and I received a call at 8:05am. That was odd. I also bought a sandwich from the lobby. An amazing sounding Buffalo Mozzarella and Tomato. Brought it up to the room and it was TOTALLY soggy. The bread was soaked. Couldn't eat it. Nasty. Was in a hurry, so I did not complain about it. Another strange thing. They have these really cool computers where you can print up your boarding pass for your flight. Southwest Airlines is basically a TEXAS, LOVE FIELD Airline. The hotel has all SORTS of airlines available on those computers, even ones I never heard of, but NOT Southwest Airlines. The woman behind the counter had to print mine for me and she could only print ONE leg of my flight. Strange. The other \"nice\" properties that I found online for Downtown Dallas were all close or above $200/night. They could NOT be better than Aloft. Save yourself $100 and stay at this hotel. Anyways, I had a LOT to work to do so I was \"locked up\" in the room most of the time. And I liked it. I felt like I was in my own little studio.

When I first walked in the lobby after a long and wearisome plane ride, I looked around and sincerely wondered whether I would be able to get any rest in there. Unpainted concrete and bare brick was the dominant finish, offset by jazzy colors in the lighting and furniture. There is a scent of citrus. The reception desk is a small circular concrete island that resembled a coffee kiosk. Three high-energy workers were squeezed into the tiny space in the middle. Getting checked in actually went pretty quickly - the workers were quite fast and efficient. None looked over age 22. My worries were allayed when I got to my room. The minimalist decor was restful enough and it was absolutely quiet in there. I liked the tall ceiling and I adored the wall of windows opposite my bed. Some people have said that this is an all-suite hotel. It is not. Mine was a simple, single room with a bath, but it was certainly big enough for just me. Most rooms however were much larger. My main experience of this hotel though was the COLD. Here's a tip if you are at all cold-natured, BRING WARM PAJAMAS! And a cozy sweater. I always travel with an electric heating pad just in case the hotel room is cold, and boy it really saved me this time. The best advice I could give you is to test the thermostat just as soon as you check in and see if it responds to your instructions. If it doesn't, ask for it to be fixed right then, don't wait until you are already in your pajamas and tired and have to wait for them to send a guy up. That's what happened to me. After multiple tries to stop the arctic blast blowing into my room, they sent up a guy they called an \"engineer,\" he poked the buttons of the thermostat for about five minutes, said he thought it was probably fixed and that he would monitor it remotely. Well, it didn't fix it and he didn't come back. I only stayed two nights anyway so I decided it was only worth so much fuss. I wore my coat in the room. But if I had researched hotels in advance, I might have stayed in the elegantly beautiful Omni instead, or maybe one of the historic hotels nearby.

My only quibble with the room was the lack of drawers; I like to put things away, and it was hard to do with just a couple of shelves and a small hanging area for clothes. While there isn't a restaurant, there is a bar and a small food service area that met the needs for breakfast and snacks. In the morning there is good, free coffee starting at 6 am (the day I had to be at the convention center at 6:20, the coffee made me very happy). They also have limited room service, but I didn't use it. They even have coin operated laundry and the desk will give you quarters for the machines. The staff was friendly and helpful.

I like the fact that the developers of this hotel gave an old building new life. I also admire the attempt to keep nostalgia alive. What I didn't appreciate was knowing that I could have stayed in any number of nearby hotels and had a better experience. First impressions are important and the Aloft won me over initially. The lobby is expansive and funky. You get a good vibe right from the beginning. However, my first impression quickly wore off upon reaching my room. The appearance was good but when I tried to use the wifi to catch up on the emails I had missed during my flight, no dice. I improvised by going old school and plugging into the LAN - strike two. The front desk assured me they would \"reset the connection for my floor\". That didn't work either; at least not in time for me to use it before my first meeting. I tried again when I returned that evening. Got a connection but it was slower that dial up. I don't base my hotel experience solely on the internet connection. There were other things that turned me off as well, such as scratched and peeling wallpaper and light switches located far from the bed, requiring you to walk in relative darkness back to bed. The shower never got hot either; warm, but not hot. When I went to the lobby kiosk to print my boarding pass I experienced more retro technology and had to go behind the front desk counter to take care of it. It rained virtually the whole time I was in Dallas. The hotel employees wer good about calling cabs for guests but I would have preferred loaner umbrellas or a hotel shuttle for nearby drop-offs. My experience at this Aloft left me thinking that they were trying to emulate the look and feel of the Courtyard rebrand implemented over the past few years. In my opinion they have fallen far short. I try to be positive with my hotel reviews, so let me finish with this. The location of this hotel is very good. You feel safe here and it's within walking distance of many cool things to see or do in downtown Dallas. If your mission is business, my recommendation is to look elsewhere.

Right when you walk in, you will definitely be taken aback by the decor of the place. A former warehouse then transformed into a boutique-ish hotel, the space is modern and young, with a casual check-in counter that doubles as a cashier for the small convenience store that they call Re:fuel. There's also a lounge area called Re:mix with a pool table and LCD TV playing sports all day. The hotel bar is called WYZ and it is actually pretty popping at night, mostly from the guests staying there though. Checking-in was pretty smooth and we got to our rooms without hassle. However... that's where the problem starts. First, my wireless phone in the room kept on making double beeps as if it was out of battery. Called front desk and when they sent an engineer up, the engineer waited with me for over 10 minutes waiting for the phone to beep again. I felt so bad and told him it was alright so he did a hard reset on my phone just in case it happened again. Next, I wanted to check out the view from my room and when I tried to use the remote for the automated curtain, it didn't move at all! Called front desk and reported the problem and they said the engineers were off so they will check on it tomorrow. In the morning I left and then when I got back, the problem wasn't fixed so when I was downstairs I mentioned to the front desk. That was when they told me that some rooms' curtain had malfunctioned and they were waiting for parts so they can retrofit it into a traditional pulled up curtains -____- Super fail on Aloft's part. The shower was also a huge issue. On the first night my co-worker complained that he didn't have hot water at all, then on the 2nd night, it happened to me. Called front desk and their explanation was that since it is an old building, the pipes' pressure isn't as strong so he suggested me turning on the faucet as well as the shower. It did work, but the water was definitely just a step above warm. Fail once again. Used the hotel's gym a few times as well. Like other SPG hotels, they provide towels and headphones just in case you don't have any. The headphones were kinda useless though since the TVs on the cardio machines weren't connected to the cable and you could only get the basic. Some didn't even work well... As for the weight equipment... not much, some free weights and a pulley machine with a situp machine. Fairly limited. The Re:fuel section is a small market and they sell things from muffins and cereal in the morning to Red Bull and Naked juice. Of course, it is overpriced, but the blueberry muffin was pretty damn delicious, although a muffin, Naked juice, and a cookie costs me $8-9. The things I did like about the hotel were the modern space, the pool table, the spacious rooms, and the free-wifi. However, even the wi-fi had a bit of trouble since they were in the process of setting up new routers.

One evening the bar area had been rented for a private party so the hotel guests had very limited access. The bar staff were very good, but it's rude to be told we couldn't sit at the bar when we're staying at the place. We arrived one night to a valet attendant insisting he had to park our car even though we were hotel guests with a parking pass. The manager on duty, a lovely young lady who had helped us with other things, went with us to chat with the valet attendant. He reluctantly acquiesced, but seemed miffed that he should have to take orders from a woman and was surly to us when we returned to our car later.

It's a renovated old building that's been redone in a quite modern style. It has an open lobby floorplan with a pretty cool bar and a self-service pantry with a mix of food and beverage items. It doesn't offer a full-service breakfast, but you can purchase made in-house hot breakfast sandwiches and pastries that are very good. The rooms are quite large and are tastefully decorated. They've got excellent AV gear, and really good high def which I've sometimes found lacking in hotels in this value band. The room layouts can be a little quirky because they adapted them to the old building. The beds are comfortable and the whole place still smells new. My only complaints are that It tends to attract a young crowd on the weekends, and given the location it always seems like I get a few hallway partiers around 2AM (may be a + for some people).

The pool deck is gorgeous, but gets sun from 8:30 to 10:30 am as it is on the wrong side of the building. Dallas is in the middle of a record heat wave (over 100 degrees for the past two months everyday) and the pool was way too cold because it is in the shade all day. Lastly, the clientele - what a bunch of weirdos. Granted, this has nothing to do with the hotel quality or service, but this place attracts weirdos. I suppose if you have a really trendy hotel in a downtown urban area that is priced pretty reasonably, you're going to get weirdos. Really loud, drunk weirdos, who stay up late and come home at 4 a.m. and scream in the hall.

But that's where the praise ends. It was very dark and half the lights didn't work. It was pretty small and in fact the shower was set up so that you could see the person showering from the main room (some sort of weird glass, rather than a wall, connecting them). One of the blinds was totally broken, making it darker. The lights above the bed didn't function, the toilet ran constantly and there was a sound like being in the middle of an airplane hanger. The wakeup calls came late and no one called to check when one day I didn't answer (I was already in the shower). They didn't bring me any new towels (even though I made it clear that I needed them). The cordless phone was out of batteries. So all in all, my feeling was the room was poorly maintained from anything other than a cleaning standpoint. Oh - and booking for this hotel was incredibly difficult - the people I spoke with on the phone were completely incompetent. They didn't know what the conference was that I was referring to. Yes they did! They were out of rooms for the conference two months out. No they weren't - they had plenty of rooms! They couldn't find my reservation (I was on hold for 45 mins). They found it! They lost my reservation. They found it again! In the end, the company sponsoring the conference booked my room - I could no longer deal. Then when I tried to get an online receipt for the room (to do my expense report) they said it would take a week to send it.

Also, they don't have vending or ice machines anywhere other than in the lobby. Free wired and wifi, and portable electronics plug in and play on tv screen. Which is a 35\" flatscreen. There is no inroom directory or phone book, so if you want a pizza, you have to figure that out some other way. There are two desks in the room, but only one chair. And it is shower only, no tub. There were two styrofoam cups for the coffee. There is a parking charge of $8. It is only one block from the convention center, so very easy to leave your car there and walk over.

He then gave us the wrong room 3 different times! We ordered one of the \"Deluxe Ultra Savvy Suites\" and 3 different times he tried to put us in a different room. It took the assistant GM to finally get the room right. Then they refused to let us pay in cash. Later that night a fight broke out in the hallway outside our door. Someone began wildly knocking and when we open the door some woman rushed into our room assaulting people. It was madness. We had NEVER seen anything quite like it. The police and security conveniently never found the perpetrators and we then asked to leave the hotel because we didn't want to stay in that dump another minute. At checkout the front desk rep. named Carly informed me there would be no charges placed on the room and that because there were no charges there was therefore \"nothing to sign\". I asked her to check and double check and the answer remained the same. Three days later our card was charged for the account. I called the hotel and the assistant GM April then told me shed get it resolved and that she'd call back within an hour. Three hours pass and I go up to the hotel only to be greeted by a rude and inconsiderate man named Scooter who is supposed to be the GM and owner. This awful man proceeded to accuse us of never leaving the hotel and refused to refund the charges. DO NOT STAY HERE!! THEY WILL ROB YOU AND LIE TO YOUR FACE!

It takes the modern style of the W Hotels and brings that to a slightly lower tier hotel that maintains the cool, sleek amenities of the W Hotels while combining them with do-it-yourself loft style features. The first thing I noticed is the novel and very smart layout of the room. It was quite spacious and roomy but everything you need is there and is organized/laid out well. I love how the bathroom was designed so that the sink is separate from the toilet and shower and the \"closet\"/clothes storage area is close to the bathroom, and how the sink instead of being centered in the counter is towards the left leaving you with more counter space for your toiletries. You can tell a lot of thought was put into function as well as form. My room had huge windows that let a lot of light into the room and was nicely designed. The bed was awesome as they all are in SPG properties. I used the 24/7 gym and it was great with nice equipment, very clean with all the needed amenities (towels, water, music, yoga mats, etc.) The hotel bar is really fun and not surprisingly busy. Great cocktails and great small bites. There's also a pool table that got a lot of use by the hotel guests. In terms of location, it's literally across the street from the Convention Center so very convenient if you're attending a show there and also still close to the hot spots downtown which are all a short cab ride away.

The bathrooms near our meeting space looked like they hadn't been cleaned in weeks. When I asked for the bathroom to be cleaned ASAP and no one came for more than an hour, I did my best to clean them myself. The office center printer didn't work nor the airline check-in kiosk. It was only after someone at our corporate office got involved that the staff started accommodating our requests and stopping by to check on our meeting. The decor and rooms look much nicer online than they do in person. Overall it seemed like the staff was clueless and didn't understand the value in an apology (for how badly everything was organized). I can say that the lounge area was popular with our group and we appreciated the complimentary drinks and some food they comped because of our experience - but that's about it. My recommendation is that you find somewhere else to stay.

Accurate, if their vision is of mismanagement and ineptitude. This hotel did not have a reliable air-conditioning system during much of our 5 week stay in June; this frequently resulted in rooms that were 90 degrees with no air circulation (windows do not open). Several members of our group were told they had to change rooms upon returning from work at 11PM on Sunday night. Rooms with a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign were regularly entered; on at least one occasion to remove a microwave (and not replace it) for no apparent reason. Hot water was not available on several occasions. Power was shut off completely one afternoon; the only advance notice was taped to elevator doors, rather that placed under room doors. One of our group's rental cars was \"booted\" in the parking lot even though registered to stay another 2 weeks. An additional charge to my credit card appeared days after checking out and paying in full. A call to the Aloft confirmed that this was their error and they promised to credit my card immediately; a week has passed and nothing has been done. These are only a few examples. My colleagues and I are frequent travelers; we agree that we have never stayed in a more poorly run property. The only thing I can recommend in their housekeeping staff, who did an excellent job of maintaining this dismally renovated old warehouse. It must be that \"vision\" thing: bravely furnished with cheerfully insubstantial plastic and vinyl, with exposed and rustically lathed concrete ceilings and not a padded floor the entire building.

The hotel is modern and trendy and I enjoyed that part of it. When we got back from dinner and drinks, we planned to hang out in their bar, the wxyz bar. There was a birthday party and after-wedding party going on so it was really loud and rowdy. This was not a big deal but we had one drink and then decided to enjoy a more peaceful evening in our room. When we got to our room around 10pm, there was a huge party next door. People were very loud and pouring out of it. We asked to be moved and they moved us to a 7th floor corner room. The room was fine but it didn't have a few of the amenities that normal hotel rooms do such as an ice bucket, glasses to drink, etc. The 7th floor was hot and musty and smelled like chlorine. When we got into the room, we realized the a/c was on a sensor so there was no a/c on until we walked in. Although it took quite a long time to cool the room (this is Texas in June), we were ok with it and happy to enjoy the hotel. Then, we went to sleep... We both woke up at least once an hour, if not more, completely sweat soaked. The sensor did not stay on since there was no motion in the room so as soon as we fell asleep, the a/c would shut off. I called downstairs and they informed me that there was not a technician in the hotel until tomorrow. I said, we are only staying one night and he said there was nothing he could do about it. I had the worst night of my life and my husband's birthday night was ruined. In addition, there was another rowdy and drunk hotel guest in the hallway at 2am, screaming at the top of his lunges and acting very belligerent.

We don't all go to hotels to sleep. It was pretty ideal though because we were able to sit down on the couch in the lounge and chat it up for a little bit before going up to our room. The bar was in the same area as the lounge, but somewhat sectioned off. There was a nice fireplace that separated us from the bar for a little bit more privacy. The feel of this hotel was that it was very much on the trendy and hip side. I'm in my 20's and there were also other people around my age hanging out on the first floor. This was on a Saturday evening though. I must say that this hotel was a little difficult for me to find though. No visible signs to indicate that I was at the hotel or anything. It's downtown and surrounded by other tall building of various sorts so you think your just driving by another building instead of a hotel. Maybe that's my fault because we don't have swanky hotels where I live, but some visible eye-level signage at this hotel would be helpful. Just a suggestion. While I was driving to the hotel, there were some hobos on the street. Not surprising because it is located downtown, but it did worry me a little. The parking lot was not well lit either! Except for the small side slit. Major safety hazard! As for the actual room itself, it was fun looking! Definitely different than what I'm used to staying in. But it fit the occasion that I was there for which was a fun evening. I'd recommend this hotel for a short trip or stay. If you and your friend or mate want somewhere hip and trendy to getaway, this might be a place to consider. I saw more of a younger crowd here. So this place will not suit everyone's taste. The bathroom was pretty cool looking and there were things about the room that made it a little eccentric which I like. It was a good experience getting to stay somewhere that I usually wouldn't. I didn't actually have to pay for the room either, and if I couldn't get a good deal on a room here, I probably wouldn't stay there again myself. Simply because I don't need all the frills to make my stay somewhere enjoyable. All I typically need is nice looking, modern, clean and safe hotel. And I can get that at a great price almost anywhere! Especially somewhere like Dallas. This was the type of hotel where you were paying more for the look and fancy-shmancy atmosphere than anything else. There was no fridge or microwave in the room, no free-breakfast or complimentary anything.

There is no room service but the hotel has a 24 hour canteen with a variety of food - toast your own bagels and get fresh espresso for breakfast, grab a feshly made salad for lunch or a fresh muffin or cookie for a snack. They even have ice-cream and candy, plus a whole range of incidentals (things you might need to pop out to a 7/11 for in the middle of the night). The best thing is that everything is really cheap. Most decent hotels charge you $20+ for breakfast but we managed to escape for under $5 each. After five days this really saved us some cash. The only negative about the hotel is there is not a lot close by - no restaurants, shopping etc. but I found this pretty typical of Dallas CBD - there's not a lot going on.

Not many alofts have suites. + Chelsea in reception is very nice and helpful - Located in an area is that dead at night. Car/Taxi is encouraged, walking... probably not. - Questionable windows. Aloft Dallas wanted to keep the aesthetics of the building, so they kept the really old single pane windows that involve pushing a rusty metal bar in order to open the window. The rusty bar has sharp edges that could cause you to get cut while operating the window. Though I'm staying here in the Fall season. The summers could get really hot and winters really cold in the room because of drafts through the old windows.

I was correct, but I really think this hotel has the potential to be really good.. I booked my room using Starwood points. When I arrived to check in, they could not find my reservation and asked for my confirmation #. I stay in a lot of Starwood hotels on points, and have never been asked for the confirmation #. I had to go out to my car and get my laptop, and show the lady the email that they sent me, which included the conf. #. She still couldn't find it, and finally just made me a new reservation. That was fine, but I was wondering what would have happened if they didn't have vacancies- I'd probably have been out of luck. Another reviewer mentioned this happening- this is a pretty serious thing- they really need to take care of the people who have chosen the Starwood brand. Lobby was pretty nice, they had a bar with cool modern seating and light fixtures. I didn't have a drink there, so I can't speak to how good the bar is. They also have a little \"store\" close to the check in desk. It has toiletries, snacks, drinks, sandwiches/wraps, salads, etc. Prices were a little high (as expected.) My wife and I split a wrap, and it was similar to what you'd get out of a convenience store cooler, only more expensive. The room was OK, but there were a few things that didn't really make sense. First off, the overall look: pretty cool. There was exposed brick and huge concrete columns, it looked like.... well... \"a loft..\" Even though we were on the 8th floor, views from the windows were so-so, and we only had one window in the main room. The bathroom is pretty cool looking, there was another window actually IN the shower that they put a see through shade over. (Hopefully, you can see out, but no one can see in.) Kind of weird to be standing naked showering by a full length window that you can see out of. So as I said before, there were a few details that didn't make sense. On one wall, there are two tables/desks separated by sort of a bench. Even though there were 2 identical desks, there was only one chair. When we ate our wrap from the lobby, we wanted to pull both chairs up and eat together on one table, but we couldn't. Closet- luckily, we were only in town for a couple of days. There isn't really a closet to hang suits/jackets or dresses. There was a little alcove that had a couple of hangers in it where you would have to hang your garment parallel with the wall (with the front or back facing you, instead of the shoulder like in a regular closet- I hope that makes sense.) Anyway, I guess you could have hung 1 or 2 garments, but not more. Amenities- they give you a fridge, which is awesome. Free WiFi. There is also a coffee maker, and you get complimentary coffee and bottled water. There was something that was missing- and I don't know if I've ever stayed in a hotel in my life that didn't have this. There were no glasses/plastic cups, and there was no ice bucket. The front desk told me that ice was available in the little \"store.\" I don't know if they charge for it, or if you just pick it up. I saw some little \"ice bucket size\" bags in a freezer in the store. I didn't get a bag, but IF they charge for it, that's ridiculous. Even the Super 8 doesn't charge for ice. I inquired about getting glasses (I was planning on having a few cocktails in the room, but we ended up staying out so late that I didn't) and the guy told me that when the bar opened, they could get me some glasses.. Again, seems like that could be easily solved by putting some plastic cups in the room- I guess they feel like the bottled water takes care of that.. Parking was fine, it was $6 a day, and right on the hotel property (you didn't have to walk far.) Shuttle- I was told when I checked in that there's a shuttle that would take you from the hotel to the West End. This was awesome- only problem was that in 2 days, I never saw it. Cab rides to the West End (tons of restaurants, bars, shopping, etc.) were $6-$8. Location of the hotel was great- really close to JFK museum, Dallas Holocaust Museum, West End, House of Blues (if you are in town for a concert/show as we were- it's about an $8 cab ride). All in all, there are some weird little details that should be fixed, but overall I thought the hotel was pretty cool, and has the potential to be really great.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cGAVE AWAY MY ROOM AND NEARLY RUINED MY TRIP\u201d", "Author": "spgplat2", "ReviewID": "UR47352807", "Content": "My mother just turned 55 and for her birthday my father and I purchased tickets for our family to attend the Texas - Oklahoma football game in Dallas. She is one of the biggest University of Texas fans and on her list of things to do before she dies, this was number 8. Hotels generally sell out early and cost was a huge concern given the high price of tickets so I had booked us reservations for two rooms at the Aloft Dallas on August 18th. Then I noticed that they disappeared out of my account and so I decided to call and see what the deal was. No one could explain how my reservations were lost and since they had no record of them, they refused to honor them. I was only offered to book at the current rate, which was higher at that point and there were no longer any suites available. All I was able to book was a King room for two nights using points, but I had to book another room at another hotel because the Aloft didn't have any suites or two double bed rooms available. I then called a week before my stay to make sure they had my new reservation. The woman at the front desk and the manager both basically called me a liar, saying that if I had made a reservation online they would have it. I had to call the national reservations number and have them e-mail the hotel a copy of my reservation before they believed me. The manager said he'd call me back after he received the e-mail, but never did. He was then unavailable when I called again, but this time they had my reservation on file, so I didn't press it. So now the day arrives. After a full day of flying, I arrived at the Aloft hotel a little before midnight. I walked up to the desk, and was immediately told that they have no more rooms available, and they'll try to get me into another hotel. So after calling numerous times to confirm, they still screwed it up. I was extremely upset, as was my entire family. I am a platinum preferred guest and should not have my room given away, EVER. After I sat at the desk for 45 minutes while they called hotels in the area, I told them I hadn't eaten and was going to walk to get some food and if they could call me immediately when they have it figured out. After about 25 minutes, the manager called and said that he has a room at a Hyatt Place and for me to come by the hotel for the paperwork. I inquire as to the location of the hotel and he tells me it is in FORT WORTH, which is 30 miles away!!!! The game was at 11am in the morning and traffic is horrible so this was unacceptable, not to mention I didn't even have a car. He then said he could put me Irving which was a less atrocious 17 miles away. Hardly comparable as the entire reason to stay downtown is to be able to take the DART to the game and to avoid gameday traffic. Since I didn't have a car I couldn't have even gotten to Fort Worth or the game so I told him that I didn't want to stay in Fort Worth or Irving and that I would have to make alternate accomodations on my own. He said they would try to fit me in the next day, but after making alternate plans I called the next day to let them know not to even bother. Three things really upset me about this situation. When I arrived, the woman at the desk mentioned that a woman earlier had nearly threatened to kill her because they gave away her room and she appreciated me being cordial to her because she of course had nothing to do with reservations. This upset me because it shows that they KNEW about this problem much earlier and did NOTHING to try to make alternate plans for me until I got there. It's clear they were basically hoping people didn't show up so they could avoid the problem. How hard would it have been to call me when they realized the problem to give me a heads up and to let me know they were working on it? Secondly, I was never offerred any sort of compensation nor have I received an apology call or e-mail since the incident. This upsets me even more because not only should they have been working on this problem from the second they realized it (I'm positive they could have fixed it because the person right in front of me was booked into a hotel right down the road) they didn't even care enough to try to appease me after I showed up. I expected, at the least, two complimentary nights at the hotel to be used whenever I returned to town in addition to having my points refunded for the stay. Neither of which has happened yet. Thirdly, throughout the entire situation, I was treated like I was an enormous hassle for them and that I was being ridiculous and difficult for being upset about being offered a hotel in Fort Worth. This was the best they could they said. This is a lie because they should have been trying to fix this problem hours before. The lobby was clean from what I could tell, but I was never able to see a room, because someone else was sleeping in it.
