It was remarkably unchanged. The hotel is superbly priced and strategically located for travelors more interested in budget and history than in prestige and luxury. It was great to live there on a study sabbatical from my college. I had no problems with cleanliness, noise, or insects of any kind. The staff were completely courteous and competent, a trait that I experienced again on this visit. The front desk quoted 230 pesos as the current rate. I hope TripAdvisor accepts my unusual review and that other \"student\" travelors will benefit.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cstar in your own Mexican Golden Age movie\u201d", "Author": "jamiejet", "ReviewID": "UR102687693", "Content": "In 20 years, I have stayed here 4 times. I am still loyal to the Monte Carlo but must admit that it needs some help. During my first 3 visits, the interior was verdant with palms, calla lilies and other plants. Now, the few palms left need a friend with a green thumb. This last time, I got a room in the back of the hotel. The positives: clean linen, comfortable bed, old style windows that matched perfectly the interiors of Mexico's Golden Age movies that I watched on 'de pelicula' Channel 29. The negatives: stiff pillows, faded carpets, mosquitos at nite, bored receptionists who could tidy up the front desk mess in 5 minutes or water the thirsty plants. The Monte Carlo is close to everything, the rates cannot be beat, and it is across the street from the historic Pasteleria Ideal. Still, I could polish up this gem in a week. I hope someone with a sense for history will. PS.

I've been to Mexico 50 times since 1979, stayed at the Monte Carlo 1-2 nights roughly once or twice most years. It makes a fine pied a terre in Mexico City, to see Mexico City, before venturing a-hinter. But -- ascetic it is! No frills for you! D H Lawrence and W Somerset Maugham used the Monte Carlo as their base in Mexico City. Staff and guests are friendly, though tend to be quiet, not that outgoing. Lots of youngish backpackers from Europe and Mexico.. An interesting place to stay. White marble lower floor and stairs, old wood above, high ceilings, high courtyards,. $22 with a private bath. truly spartan single -- or $4 less for washbasin only, bathroom down the hall. It's a good place to unwind, watch late night Mexican TV the night you land in Mexico City. Very ascetic, bare-bones. No bug problems in my experience. People from all over the world stay here.

This time, in Room 116, which is really the second floor, has four double beds, the bed bugs attacked me! I looked like I had the measles on inside both arms, side of neck and face. My brother who lives in Mexico uses this hotel frequently in the past with no problems. Very quaint Mexican, prices from 250 for two to 450 pesos per night for four of us. Except for this one time problem you might try it. Right around the corner is the Hotel Isabela, also OK, and has small good restaurant attached, lots of international visitors, A VIPS restaurant is just up the street and close by is Sanborns, a very nice restaurant but with American prices. About three blocks away is an internet cafe and good to print your boarding pass day before leaving for States, only 10 pesos. It is an adventure to find it up an escalator. Be sure you have enough Spanish to pull this off, or just look up phrases in travel dictionary and copy them down in writing on a piece of paper for people to read, especially in internet cafe. Accent is everything in Mexico, or you will not be understood, Water is Awa, not Agua. Mexican people are very helpful with directions, especially security cops that are in every major store on streets crowded with vendors and unbelievable noise and crowded. Walked around by myself, a red haired gringo age 60 with no problems and never felt threatened. Be sure and have hotel order cabs for you and to airport was 150 pesos with tip. Cab for two to Teotiwaucan was 600 pesos plus tip and tolls and you can come and leave when you want, not have to stay all day like with bus. Worth it unless you are on a budget. Big Catholic Church and Government buildings with Diego Rivera paintings all walking distance and all this in Socalo district. There are no rest rooms anywhere except in public buildings and be sure and carry large light weight over the shoulder bag with TP, baby wipes, and water with you while wondering around. Rest rooms seldom have paper products except in fancy places. Bottled water is cheap and everywhere so don't worry about that, but it gets tiring using bottled water to brush your teeth! Leave all jewelery home and men keep your wallet in your front pocket. Buy a cheap Timex with strap. You can exchange dollars to pesos at airport coming and going but keep at least 100 pesos to buy food or drink at the airport after you go through security. If you have any left they make for good conversation at home and for scrap books!", "Date": "May 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cMy 2nd home in Mexico\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2832048", "Content": "As a flight attendant I travel the world for a living.

Enjoy Mexico City and this hotel as much as I have and continue to . Better from single travelers by far. If you're a family, spend more somewhere else. If you're up for adventure, choose MonteCarlo.
