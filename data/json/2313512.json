I am not sure what happened, other than the hotel Perhaps decided to stay independent I guess. You might want to verify any reservations before arriving at this property to avoid any unnecessary hassles.

Although managment told me upfront there will be no noise there was construction noise to be heard during the entire stay. We had an excellent view of the Hagia Sophia which made up for the bland interior of the room. Why they put an oldfashioned Irish Pub in a contemporary yet slightly Ottoman style hotel is beyond me. The hotel is a conversion of an office building, not initially built as a hotel. Maybe that\u00c2\u00b4s why noise travels easily from room to room. My husband had to get up at night to ask the neighbours to turn down their tv. He then realized that it was not that noisy in the neighbour\u00c2\u00b4s room. The TVs are integrated in the walls (inside a mirror - weird, like in a Vegas bathroom) maybe that\u00c2\u00b4s the reason why TV noise is easily heard in the adjacent rooms. The location of the hotel could not be any better. The street is pedestrian, so no traffic noise. All major attractions are within easy walking distance. The decoration of the hallways and the entrance hall are nice. Why the huge lobby only has one small sofa and 2 chairs is again beyond me. Obviously they don\u00c2\u00b4t want anybody to sit there. One last suggestion from my side: Turn off the loud music on the terrace which travels into the bedrooms above.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cCentered, Modern, mixed with ottoman gentle flavour - good to go!\u201d", "Author": "CARGO2010", "ReviewID": "UR127251217", "Content": "The location is top in the Old City - the Sultanahmet aria, at 4 minutes walk of Agia Sophia Mosque and very close to a number of good restaurants. If you are lucky (or by request) you could have a room facing towards the Mosque. Evening view is great but also the day time one! The hotel seems to be newly refurbished, in a very nice way (entrance seems ato bring a sort of vintage style), modern while it also keeps a touch of the traditional symbols of the old empire. Rooms are large, top equiped bathrooms, Wide flat screen. No noise, no difficult things to accomodate with. Maybe just that when staff speaks in Englsh you need to pay attention. Personnel is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast: i initially expected a larger variety of food, but i then realised that the food offered is good quality and generally you can find a lot to choose from.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cGreat but still needs improvoment\u201d", "Author": "RobertPL", "ReviewID": "UR126665217", "Content": "We were staying at this hotel between 22-25 March 2012. The location is perfect, in a heart of Sultanahmet District (Old Istanbul), just 300 m from Hagia Sophia and 500 m from Blue Mosque, less then 200 m trom tramway stops. It is easy to get there form/to the airport. The hotel is new, Looks great from the outside shining its modern architecture and ambiance lights. The room (Double Delux corner) was clean, had all amenities you ight need, we could see the Hagia Sophia through the window. However, air-conditioning system did not work properly. We notified the reception about it but nothing improved. We were told that someone woul come but nobody came to fic it. We switched the AC off and opened the windows. It workds just fine! Also, there was a constant noise in the room like it was a AC pipe in the walls making noise. It did not disturbe much though. The hotel impressed us with its nice interior and it was really clean. Wherever you go you could smel such an nice scent of flowers. Very nice!

Still bugs to work out and lacks in amenities.\u201d", "Author": "JNYCA", "ReviewID": "UR120827637", "Content": "Great location, super clean, and great towels/linens. The public spaces are big expanse of white marble, glass and and a bit of wood. The lobby and mezzanine are devoid of decorations. A bit barren and cold, but it's a nice contrast to the visual jungle found in the rest of Istanbul. Lacks amenities hence the lower service rating of 3 stars. Save for one high end dress shop and restaurant, there are no other stores. The gym is not open. The terrace, restaurant and hotel appeared very empty. Note: If the hotel could see putting in heat lamps on the terrace, I bet it would bring in the crowds. Awesome views of the mosque. Rooms. Great towels and duvet. Great wifi and the tv is inset within the wall behind a one way mirror. Invisible when off. Large space and great view. Nice bathroom. I would give the rooms 5 stars except for the bugs below, and gave it 3 stars for the room. Very, very firm bed. I had to sleep on the duvet as I could not sleep on the mattress. If you prefer a pillowtop mattress, don't stay here. I switched rooms. My first room on the Floor 2 faced a building where one of it's searchlight shone directly into the room. The blackout drape could not block the light out. I moved into a new room the next day; there was a constant very loud humming noise - like an exhaust hood turn on high. The technician could not locate and stop the noise. The fact that the hotel did not notice this problem highlights it's shortcoming. Great view. Kudos for them trying. They moved me into a third room; same great view, but poorly installed shower control. The water ran hot and cold, and the water would not shut off unless the dial was turned to a precise location. No shower robes (the first two rooms had them) Overall, the hotel has lots of potential; it's new and they have a lot of kinks. I was disappointed with my stay; I would give it a second chance but not until they work out the bugs and add more services. This hotel is 25% pricier than its sister hotel located 10 minutes away. For what they charged, I expected a lot more and didn't get it. That's why I am giving it two stars for value.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Old City\u201d", "Author": "Watchdog5151", "ReviewID": "UR120542834", "Content": "This is a new hotel and they are really doing a great job.
