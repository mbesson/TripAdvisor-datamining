{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cheap and Friendly We stayed at Dong Si Fu Yuan Hotel for over a week and we were extremely satisfied with the experience. The staff is very friendly and helpful with any problem or question one might have. They sell a tourist map of Beijing which has names of popular destinations and sights written in both English letters and mandarin. But the staff would write it in Mandarin other things for us, like addresses or names of dishes which is a useful thing to have if you do not know any Chinese. The rooms were nice and clean, though just a bit smaller than we expected. There was always hot water in the room to make tea. The restaurant is small but is very convinient and cheap for breakfast. Their English menu is not extensive but the food is simple and decent. It is worth considering the tours that this hotel offers. The tours are relatively cheap and can be ordered at the last minute. But one of the less pleasant experiences was the information about the walking distance to the subway station. It is a good 30 minute walk from the hotel. The Wangfujing shopping mall and the center of the city is about 20 minutes of walking so sometimes it is easier just to take a 5min taxi ride. Overall, it was a great and very satisfying experience.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR406689299", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Thank you very much!

Henry was most helpful and confirmed all details by email. Not knowing much at all about the location, the hotel etc, I was a little nervous, but was surprised on arrival at how clean and extremely cheap the hotel is. It was recently renovated, so was spotless. The front desk staff were always friendly  helpful and spoke a little English. The hotel was conveniently located near the Long Fu Da Shah Palace, so it was a very easy reference to give to taxi drivers, who speak little to no English. The hotel was about a 10 minute taxi ride to Tiananmen Square. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR341171609", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d568910-r5333624-Dong_Si_Fu_Yuan_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "568910", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
