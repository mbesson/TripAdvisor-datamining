We just wanted a place to \"crash\" after a transatlantic flight, then take the airplane back home. First we were surprised that we had a free airport shuttle to the hotel, which meant getting to the hotel took 10 minutes, in 20 minutes we were in the room, unwinding from the flight. The rooms were very nice, modern furnishing, big bathroom and shower. One thing we did find odd was that there were not toiletries, instead a message, saying we can request them at the reception if we need any. We didn't need anything so that was ok. Room heating was very good, windows were very large, we had some kind of view (room 434) and we would open the window for some fresh air. We had internet in the room, I used Ethernet, and I had no problems with it, just plug and surf. On each floor the hallway has some \"theme\" to it, one is a business center, in one you could use laptops of the hotel, one was a \"wiizone\", one was just a relaxation area. The decorations were very modern, which was a nice change from our other hotels we visited. Our room price had breakfast included, which was good for us as we had a flight at 10 a.m. There is nothing to complain about this, except perhaps that they had only scrambled eggs on the buffet (or perhaps they had other varieties, and we missed them somehow). The staff was very helpful and polite. The location of the hotel is 1km from a shopping mall, where you can go on foot, and you find all the major fashion stores (this was a boon for my wife) if you want to do a little shopping. All in all we would definately stay here again, especially for short durations, the only disadvantage to visiting madrid is that it is not close to city center, and travel by public transport probably takes a bit longer than you might need, other than that, fits the bill perfectly.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cReally enjoyed my stay\u201d", "Author": "Carolinev89", "ReviewID": "UR124142989", "Content": "Hotels in Madrid are so expensive - so we booked a few nights here and took the free airport shuttle to ride the metro into the centre.

Having booked a non smoking double I got to my room which was a twin. Went down to reception and they said I could have either non smoking, or a double. This was annoying as I did book in advance. But they swapped me to the double room, and after a few hours with the window open (whilst i went for dinner) the room was well aired. Room: It was well appointed with a fridge, desk, in room safe, good hanging space for clothes, and the rooms where pretty spacious. Bathroom was great, with a massive walk in shower, with amazing water pressure. It was better than a power shower, and the shower head was a massive ceiling one, or a hand held one. Also Free Wifi in hotel rooms and communal areas. I did hear the people in the next door room on one evening, but it was a slight mumble, and was not that bad. The bed is fairly comfortable, but it is sheet and blankets, not duvet which i'm not personally keen on. I have stayed in the Axor Barajas as well before, and the Feria offers very similar accommodation identical bathrooms (minus the posh toiletries) but everything is just one click less at the Feria, hence the 3 star.

Going from the hotel to the airport presented no problem because we had to reserve our place the night before our departure. However, when we traveled from the airport to the hotel, we had to wait at least that long before we got picked up, and my inability to figure out how to use a public phone at the airport gave us a good deal of uncertainty after our arrival.

About 10 minutes (walking) behind the hotel is a massive four-storey shopping center called Mercadona. There is a large food court, arcade, cinema (Spanish of course) and retail stores in the mall. Just outside the center is a bus stop with a direct connection to the Cannilejas metro station. That in turn will take you directly to downtown Madrid (Gran Via station). This station is where Puertal Del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Royal Palace and cosmopolitan shopping is all located. The bus came within 10 minutes everytime we went, and we reached Cannilejas within another 10 minutes. Gran Via is a 20 minute metro ride. Total cost per person (one way) is $3 euros.

The driver took us to Terminal 4 where everyone got off (except us who needed Terminal 1). The driver started shouting at us and literally threw our bags back onto the shuttle and told us he asked everyone which terminal they needed and that the response was Terminal Four. Well, he should have asked after everyone was on the van. I speak Spanish and explained that we had not heard the question because we were already on the van out of earshot. That did not seem to placate the driver. He took us to Terminal 1, but was very obviously angry about it. We had a wonderful 2-week trip to Spain and this last experience with the shuttle for Axor Feria was extremely irritating and disappointing. We did not deserve being shouted at and I would not stay at the hotel again, if I had to contend with the poor shuttle service from Barajas airport. It was completely unacceptable.

I stayed at the Axor for 4 days and each day I requested to use the hotel iron as my clothes were creased from travelling. It was extremely disappointing that the hotel were unable to locate an iron on any of the 4 days so I ended up having to wear creased clothes for the entire business conference. I have never had this problem at any other hotel. Perhaps the Axor need to invest in some additional irons or else start to make a note of who the iron is given to so that it is possible to locate it when a guest requests it? Or install irons in each room? As a vegetarian I was very unhappy to be served with nothing more than a plate of vegetables for my evening meal. I did not mention anything at the time as I didn't want to cause a fuss in front of my colleagues. Most hotels I have stayed at the in past would serve a meal such as risotto, omelettes, salads with cheese, nut roasts - the meal usually includes some protein with it. To serve a plate of just vegetables not even in any discernable sauce or seasoning was not what I would expect from a hotel hosting an international business conference where you are bound to have a few vegetarian guests. The buffet breakfast was good and there was plenty there to suit most diets. The mini bar in the room had a rather limited selection in it and it is strange that the hotel does not have a bar and guests have to use the bar in the next door hotel which is part of the same chain. It is not far to walk to the next hotel, at least. I was surprised that there is no room service.

For around 65 Euros we felt we were in a pretty upscale place with free wifi internet (as well as internet cafe), lounges for group gatherings, decent TV, and a wonderful shower. Though not spacious, the room is comfortable, calm, and stylish. Another highlight is the restaurant (in the nextdoor Axor sister hotel). The lunch menu of 15 euros came with a bottle of wine, a bottle of water, good bread, appetizer (meal-sized in itself), main course, desert, and coffee. Amazing value.

On arrival the axor feria was very very impressive and belonged to the new breed of no frills hotels with minimal staff yet all amenities. The check in was quick and smooth and we were accomodated on the fifth floor with adjoining rooms. the floor theme was relaxation and seeing the room gave us that. white , contemporary and chic. the bathroom was superb and belonged in a far better level hotel. We were well directed to a nearby mall which sorted out our dinner issues.

I think they run about every 30 minutes. The Axor shuttle is not listed on the list of shuttles at the bus stop, but don't worry - it will show. From the hotel, you can walk to a HUGE shopping mall in less than 10 minutes (restaurants, stores, etc), but there is nothing else around for tourists.

Upsides: Free shuttle runs every half hour from 10am-12midnight. It runs from the airport to the hotel (catch it at arrivals T1, just across from taxi area at Salle 2) and vice-versa (catch outside of the hotel, drop off at T1 or T2 (take the latter for the Metro)). Axor Feria is one of 2 Axor hotels, which are next door to each other. The other one is Axor Barajas, which has a restaurant for lunch and/or dinner. Restaurant in Axor Barajas, next door, was a pleasant surprise. I had a wonderful meal for dinner one night and was really quite impressed. The rate I received for my room was 59 Euro per night including breakfast each morning. The breakfast was quite good. This rate was the lowest I found when searching for hotel accommodation in Madrid. Brand new hotel, so the rooms are very clean and well appointed. Felt like the hotel was influenced by Scandanavian design. Fantastic shower! Great water pressure and beautiful design. Most front desk staff are friendly and speak English, so you can get by if you only know a bit of Spanish. Although I did not visit it, the hotel is behind Plenilunio - a large shopping mall. The downsides: I had a conference at the nearby conference centre, IFEMA, but the conference centre shuttle promoted on the hotel web site was not running as of the day I arrived there. This meant I had to take the hotel shuttle to the airport and then the metro to the conference centre. I also had to do the same route to get downtown (shuttle to airport, metro downtown). A bit of a hassle, but for the cost of the hotel it was a small inconvenience. Free wifi Internet connection, both in room and on the hotel computers, was horrid! Take a network cable to use the system in your room.
