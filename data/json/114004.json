However, while the Mount View has done some minor touches to make rooms more comfortable such as replacing the bedding and installing flat screen televisions, the hotel interior needs a major overhaul to bring it up to modern standards. Some of the major issues: 1) Many wooden floorboards under the carpet creak - this is especially bothersome for late night bathroom runs. 2) The rooms are VERY small and not luxuriously appointed. We had a hard time finding room for 2 suitcases. 3) The bathroom was dated (tub with old-style shower curtain) with a free standing sink, very small vanity and little room for toiletries...not suitable for most women. 4) Noisy window unit heat/air conditioners with no thermostats to control temperature.... 5) Old style deadbolt locks with big metal keys - don't automatically lock on exit, and are easy to copy. 6) Very limited parking and no valet.

After researching for weeks I was thrilled to find a place that looked cool and modern yet quaint at the same time and they did not disappoint in any of those areas. The location is excellent and I'm pretty sure that I would stay there again. Mount View has three Winery Cottages with outdoor spa tubs and I had booked the Peju Winery Cottage for my boyfriend's birthday. The room was darling, not in a ruffled throw pillow sort of way, it just had a very cool vibe. It was, however, very small, but it was clean and comfortable and with the doors opened to the private patio it really made the space feel larger. Relaxing in the tub under the stars after a full day of wine tasting was incredible! It was enough space for us, it was the private patio and outdoor spa tub that sold it for us anyway, but if you are looking for a separate sitting area inside then this is not the room for you. The downside...there was construction in the alley directly behind the cottages. The first morning we awoke to the sound, sight and diesel fuel smell of a cement mixer which was towering over the gate behind our 'private' patio. Did I mention that it was 7:00 am? It was full on construction mode right outside the cottage...at 7:00am. The sweet girl at the desk seemed surprised and said that she would try to contact someone regarding the noise. The noise was so unbearable that we asked to have our breakfast delivered to us at the pool. So much for sitting on our cute patio and enjoying the morning. As we were leaving to go wine tasting the front desk girl told us that she had called the city and that they had said that it is ok to start construction @7:00 and that she would move us to another room, in the hotel, if we'd like. Again, the deciding factor for choosing Mount View was because we wanted the outdoor space. We didn't want to be in a stuffy hotel room, we wanted fresh air. Ultimately we declined the room switch and hoped that the work would be finished by the time we got back that afternoon. When we did return, the cement mixer and construction crew were gone and waiting in our room was a bottle of Korbel and an apology note from Mount View. Ok...I don't want to come off as a jerk but, KORBEL? Seriously??? We'd just spent $ 500 on wine that day, the cottage was $387 a night, we were in Napa for goodness sake and their peace offering was a bottle of Korbel. Cheap, tacky and basically lame of Mount View. We hadn't expected anything in the form of compensation and, yes, I do believe that it was a kind gesture but it bordered on insulting and just showed a lack of appropriateness on the part of the hotel. The truth is, you will still hear a lot of noise very early in the morning from delivery trucks so pack some ear plugs if you plan on staying in a cottage. This and that...Calmart is the sweetest little market practically right next door so I highly recommend grabbing some sandwiches to pack for lunch. Palisades deli which is right across the street gets a lot of press, however, after comparing sandwiches, price and attitude from staff, Calmart was hands down the winner. They have amazing fresh deli selections and pastries to die for and all kinds of breads and cheese. Excellent produce as well. Barolo, located off the lobby of Mount View...excellent dinner! Jolie is also very popular and trendy.

We stayed in a standard queen room and purchased the 'Taste of Calistoga' package, which included dinner for two from the prix-fixe menu of the Italian restaurant downstairs, private tastings at two Calistoga wineries, a 25-min \"mud bath\" for two (more like a dirty water whirlpool, but nice nonetheless). The good: - The room was cozy, nicely-decorated and immaculate (albeit a tad small). - Mount View is located right on the main drag in Calistoga and it's an easy walk to restaurants, wine shops, and a grocery store. - Free parking off the street (not necessary in winter, but great at other times of year). - At $129 per night, the rate was reasonable. - The hotel was very quiet (as are most places in Napa during winter) and we slept like babies. - The included \"mud bath\" was a nice way to spend an hour after tasting wine all day. - The wine tastings arranged by the hotel as part of the package deal (at two smaller Calistoga wineries) were the best of our trip. - Close to Robert Louis Stevenson State Park, the Palisades trail and Mount Helena, which offer some great hikes. - The hotel pool and hot tub, which I unfortunately didn't get to use, was empty while we were there (again... in winter). The bad: - The full price of a room booked in peak season is probably a bit much for me, but then again everywhere in Napa is nuts during summer. Neutral: - I can't really comment on the spa services as all we did was our included mud-whirlpool.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cMount ViewHotel was Fantastic 9 years ago\u201d", "Author": "LD_Traveller00", "ReviewID": "UR97545285", "Content": "We had a very memorable stay 9 years ago having booked by recommendation.

My family and I are frequent visitor to the Mount View Hotel and Spa. I come up here for Mother-Daughter getaways as well as with my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 for romantic weekend getaways. The Mount View Hotel and Spa is honestly one of the most enjoyable places I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. This is by far the best place to stay in Calistoga. The location is convenient, the hotel is absolutely beautiful down to the smallest details, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. The Mount View is located in beautiful, downtown Calistoga, on the main street, Lincoln, Ave. You can walk (or bike) anywhere you need to go. There are great restaurants within walking distance... * Breakfast- in bed (you can pick your desired time of delivery), Sarafornia (don't forget to sign the wall in the back of the restaurant) * Lunch- Checkers, Buster's Southern BBQ, or pick up some sandwiches from Palisades Deli for a picnic in Pioneer Park. * Dinner- Flat Iron (DELICIOUS, right across the street, and no corkage fee) * Drinks- Hydro Bar, Barolo, or Susie's (a fun dive bar) * Wine Tasting- There are a few shops which offer wine tasting on Lincoln Ave, but I recommend renting a bike from the Calistoga Bikeshop and biking around to the local wineries. If you find some wine you like, Calistoga will even pick up your wine for you and you can pick it up at the shop later on. Beautiful trails, awesome experience! The Mount View Hotel is beautiful and they continue to make it more beautiful all the time. Over the past few years they have tastefully redecorated the hotel lobby, rooms, and pool area. It still has the feel of the historic hotel it is, but it now has a hip, upscale modern art-deco elegance. There is an outdoor heated pool as well as an outdoor jacuzzi. On Fridays, they have a weekly poolside winetasting. Awesome! The rooms have new mounted flat-screen tv's, dvd players, ipod clock-radios, and more. All rooms also have free high-speed wi-fi access. Each room I've stayed in over the years is uniquely decorated and they have each been beautiful. Although a bit more expensive, the suites and the cottages are DEFINITELY worth the money. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I are getting married in Calistoga next summer and we will be staying at the Mount View for our wedding weekend. We couldn't imagine a more perfect location for our friends and family during our special weekend. The staff here at the Mount View is awesome. They really go above and beyond to make the guests feel welcome and special. I look forward to my next visit. P.S. The MV Hotel & Spa has great weekday discounts M-Th as well as AAA discounts.

We pretty much booked the entire hotel, including the bridal suite. We had also reserved, months ahead of time, the private lounge off the lobby as an after-wedding destination for our guests (31 adults). We started experiencing problems with the staff months ahead of time. First, they charged another guest's hotel to my parents' credit card. Totally different names, etc., so not sure how that sort of mistake can happen. They also forgot to remove the group deposit from my credit card once the group booking met their deadline -- for two months. So, two month's interest was applied to my credit card. The hotel did not do anything to accommodate the error -- no free spa session, no credit to the room for the excess, unexpected charges on the credit card. When my fiance and I stayed at the hotel 6 months before the wedding, to check out the hotel and meet caterers, etc., the staff was INCREDIBLY rude to us -- one guy even told me, when he brought an iron to my room -- that the hotel was essentially doing us a favor by giving us a discounted room for the weekend, so we were not going to receive all amenities as a result (long story there). It was an odd moment. The staff wouldn't greet us back when we came downstairs and said hello to them, weird behavior like that. Unfriendly. To make matters worse, when we arrived the week of our wedding, we found out that the hotel director had forgotten to let the restaurant next store know that the private lounge had been booked by us months ahead of time as our after-wedding destination and so the restaurant had reserved it for their private party and, of course, was not about to cancel that because the hotel made a mistake. So, we had to beg the hotel to please find us an alternative option for our guests. They ended up putting us in their spa, which was a bit odd, but at least we had a place to hang out, albeit very limited seating and very bright lighting. The rooms are nice, overall, but realize that the hotel is very old and so the rooms are not spacious. Also, if you go off-season (meaning, not during the summer) the rooms get very, very cold. There are window heating units which take a very long time to heat up the room. But the art deco style is very pretty and if you don't like down comforters or pillows, they will accommodate you with non-down. The staff, especially Eric, was very much on-hand during my wedding week for my guests, one of whom was in a wheelchair. Overall, I like the hotel, but was just surprised time and time again at how clueless and a bit off the staff could be. I think it's the younger staff members who acted this way; Cassi and Nicole (managers) were very much accommodating, albeit it was Cassi who failed to notify the restaurant about our private lounge booking. Not everyone is perfect. The hotel is in downtown Calistoga, a great location, with some limited free parking if you can get there fast enough. The town is great. The rooms come with free continental breakfast (juice, coffee, tea, fruit and fresh-baked pastries from Sweetie Pies, a well-known bakery in Napa). Aveda products in the bathrooms and a nice spa downstairs. Pool and Jacuzzi in the back.

The front desk staff were polite, but they didn't smile or make us feel welcome. There was no lift/elevator in the building so we had to haul our bags up the stairs and the hallway seemed tired and a bit dated. The room was on the small side, a bit dated, but comfortable. The bed was so high you needed to launch yourself into it. Breakfast was delivered to your room the next morning which was a nice touch. The problem was that there was a wedding party staying at the hotel so they took over the pool area and hot tub that evening and all the next day up until lunch time as there was a wedding brunch, so guests couldn't use these. I went to the spa to see if we could use their facilities instead, but there was noone around. And then there was the noise! All night till 2am. I heard the next day that guests were making complaints up till long before then, but I don't think staff did anything about it. When I complained the next morning, the front desk lady just shrugged and said they were sorry, but as it was a wedding they didn't want to spoil it by breaking up the party. But what about the guests! If the staff had just tried to keep the noise down, I'd have given this a different rating, but they were just rude all round really.

The room was cozy (a little small) but the bathroom was beautiful (still had the historic tile and feel) and was very large. We were not in Napa Valley to stay in our hotel and we spent a lot of time out touring wineries or eating at restaurants so the size of the room didn't bother us. It was the perfect size to house your stuff, have a nice breakfast in bed and get ready for your day! The pool and hot tub area is very nice and large. We also had the hot tub to ourselves every time we went out which was very nice. The hot tub does not \"close\" as long as you are quiet at night and polite for the other customers. That was a very nice feature. The hotel is within walking distance of many shops and restaurants (again on main street) which is very nice. The Bar Vino looked good and the menu was very reasonably priced but we didn't have time to eat or drink there.

We were assigned room 231, A rectangular room with no view (no point even opening the blinds) Room was cosy, clean, had one bed, desk, one armchair, TV on top of a chest of drawers, bathroom was compact but clean. Design asthetic was quite traditional. Matress was a tad hard (I am a self confessed matress / bedding snob), Linens were clean but not luxurious. Did have some issues getting hot water (this affected shower & sink) - very hit & miss. We were booked on the vinotherapy package & the bottle of champagne (Korben brand - looked quite cheap - a shame really when the napa valley produces so much good sparkling wine) was in our room (shame nobody had thought to put it on ice) with glasses. Pool/Spa area was nice & empty much of the time so we had the hot tub to ourselves. Breakfast is delivered to your room (sounded like a great idea) - found the pastries to be hit & miss, somedays very fresh others a bit dry/stale. you also get a piece of fruit & a granola bar, coffee was very strong. Breakfast (continental) in bed sounded like a nice idea but in reality if was pretty average. Spa: As we had spa credit as part of the package we had booked for massages, Prior to arraiving teh spa had contacted us as they needed to change the date/time of our appointments so we arrived 15 mins before our newly scheduled appointments - nobody was maning the check in booth outside the spa entrance so we went inside to wait - after 5 mins were were quite brusquely told we needed to check in - we explained that nobody was there so we were then told to go to the hotel check in desk. Off we go to the check in desk where we are given a bit of paper with our therapists name & then returned to the spa. I had booked the hot stone massage - it was average at best, I asked for medium to firm pressure & got very little pressure, the therapist used masses of oil so I could barely feel the benefit, I could also hear quite a bit of street noise & the music kept going on and off - so the treatment room was not really a relaxing space. My fiance has a regular massage & he too was underwhelmed. It was a real shame as we had been looking forward to our treatments. Overall I am sorry to say the spa was not worth the money. Bar: We popped in planning to have a drink before dinner - place was pretty empty - after waiting over 5 mins we left without being acknowledged - Shame - the place looked nice but lacked service. The location: Was good you could walk to shops, restaurants etc. Parking: Limited. If none is available you have to park on the street outside but ensure you move your car by 11am as you will get a parking ticket. Overall the Mount View appeared very appealing from the website but was very average in reality.

There were three ladies at the checkout reception area. Not one looked up to say good morning or hello. We went up a couple of times and once again no acknowledgement.

I had Candace do a hot stone massage and it was incredible (best I've ever had in terms of hot stone massages! I swear I think I was floating thru time).

At the end of the day we did not feel like getting back into the car to go to dinner so having great dinners at Bar Vino and Brennan's (1/2 block away) was perfect.

Parking is very limited - there is an 'alley way' down the side of the hotel that you can park in, but if all the slots are full you need to park on the street well behind the hotel and it's quite a walk with your baggage.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redwood Ctiy,CA", "Title": "\u201cCute boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "mtarzon", "ReviewID": "UR5357195", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for his birthday for one night.

Instead we opted for Brannan's across the street on 2 nights - the lamb shank is to die for :-) I'd go back, but would suggest that you request a second-floor room, as our ground floor room with garden view was a bit dark, and at times didn't feel very private. They also have Aveda toiletries, which was appreciated greatly by my Fiance. We also enjoyed Dr Wilkinson's Spa as well as the Sterling Winery. Both definitely worth a visit. Going to the Petrified Forest and the Old Faithful Geyser felt a bit like something from the Simpsons - \"come and visit the world's largest ball of string\" - they are that type of attraction.

All of us had minor back aches in the morning. The walls are very thin, so make sure to take earplugs. I did and was fine, but my roommate noticed the noise. The continental breakfast delivered to your room is nothing to write home about. Basic, but if you like small breakfast, you are fine. The spa location is great, and allowed us to go from room to spa with just our robes. The spa treatments were so-so. I had a massage, hydrobath, and body polish. The hydrobath was wonderful, body polish good, and the massage disappointing. I've had many a better massage. I was a bit chilly throughout the massage (my girlfriends complained of the same) and the style of the therapist was just okay. The outdoor hot tub was nice and hot. We ate at Stomp, the restaurant in the hotel. My meal was good, although I felt the restaurant was a bit pretentious. I enjoyed the Flatiron Grille (across the street and a few doors down) better, and it was less expensive. So, overall, we enjoyed our stay. The location was nice and everything went smoothly.

There was a whirlpool in the room but it definitely needed to be updated; there were parts that were broken. And,the hotel does not have an elevator.

They should give the guest choices; pretty much every morning the snacks stayed on our tray. There wasn't anything we liked. On our 2nd day we booked spa treatments. One of the therapist was definitely not qualified for the job, I felt we paid to much for her services. The other therapist were GREAT.
