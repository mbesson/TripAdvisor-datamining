This is the oldest hotel in Ocean City, but it has been updated. It doesn't have all the things many have come to expect in modern hotels (i.e. in-room safes, blow-dryers, electronic key-cards, irons and ironing boards already in the room) but it has all the basics of a hotel at the beach. Due to the age of the hotel and them having to remodel to add things like bathrooms in every room, every room has a different layout and amenities. Advantages - * Hotel is on the boardwalk, practically right across from Ripley's Believe It or Not. Can't get much closer to the end of the boardwalk. * Room was very clean. Excellent job both cleaning between guests and every day. Considering this is a hotel on the beach, that isn't an easy job. Can tell by the wear in the sheets, blankets, etc. that they are washed often. From what I hear they totally strip the beds between guests. * Low cost for in-season hotel rooms. * Love the balcony overlooking the boardwalk. * Large free parking lot right in the middle of downtown OC. Only one parking space per room, but still nice compared to others in the area. Disadvantages - * Lots of steps. Building is 4 floors. Rooms with only 2 digits in their number are on parking lot level. There are no rooms on lobby/boardwalk level (at least that I saw). 3 digit numbers starting with 1 and 2 are actually the 3rd and 4th level from parking lot respectively. They do have an elevator but due to its age it must be operated by hotel staff. They are more then willing to run it for you, but unless you are handicapped plan on only using it for bringing luggage to and from your room. * Would be nice if they wiped down the seagull droppings on the railing on the balcony overlooking the boardwalk at least once a day. * They claim beds are queen size, but smallest queen beds I have seen. Seemed to be full size. Looked for labels on bed and can't remember exact brand but it was either \"Sealy\" or \"Serta\". Label didn't list the size. * Hallway noise. The doors are old and noisy to open and close. Every room has two sets of doors since the doors pre-date air conditioning. So there can be lots of noise when large groups of people are going in and out of their room. We brought ear plugs, but it never got so noisy that we needed them. Other then that the only problems we had were that our room had no closet and only a shower so hanging wet things up was very difficult. Every room is different so some rooms have closets, some don't. Every room has its advantages and disadvantages. Some will feel that being on the top floor is a disadvantage due to steps, other will like it because of less noise. Some will like having rooms closer to the boardwalk, others will prefer farther away. One nitpick that we had is that there aren't enough no-smoking signs in the building so people realize they aren't supposed to be smoking in rooms/hallways. For the first part of our stay, the hallway in front of our room reeked of cigarette smoke. The room itself was fine and after whatever guest was doing it checked out, things were fine and the hotel itself isn't totally responsible for its guests but we only saw one no-smoking sign and it was in the stairwell, so we would understand if guests didn't realize you aren't supposed to smoke inside in Maryland hotels. All in all a great trip and a nice hotel. We will most likely stay here again unless the private rental condo we usually stay in opens up again for non-family rentals.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cSaved our vacation!\u201d", "Author": "Hurricane74", "ReviewID": "UR138241583", "Content": "We spent 3 nights in another hotel which was so bad that my husband and I were ready to pack up and go home.

She offered us a room and even let us go upstairs and look at it ( because we were traumatized by previous hotel!!) before we paid for it. Let me say that I am in the hotel business and see all types of hotels in my days at work. From 2 star to 5 star. The Atlantic was by far the cleanest hotel I have seen! They have kept the charm but still have updated and made it very comfortable. Tammy in housekeeping made sure our room was ready quickly. We checked in at 11:30 after moving from the other hotel. She went above and beyond and even recommened a room for next years trip. In the 2 days we spent here everyone was friendly, which is really hard to find these days. We spent alot of time talking with another employee there name Mr. C. What a wonderful man!

We also had a small bathroom with just the basics. The cupboards were well stocked with towels, toilet paper, washcloths, etc... and the kitchen was stocked with dishes, utensils, etc... We also had a large living room and dining room. The location was perfect for us, especially with younger children. The only complaints that I have was the front door lock did not lock well and when it did you had a difficult time getting it open. The other complaint I have was housekeeping. We cleaned our own place and never saw a housekeeper for the week we were there. We had to take our dirty towels to the front office to exchange them for clean ones and when I did that I was told they had 5. I then took the five towels back to the apartment to share for 11 people. No one ever came and changed our bed sheets the whole time we were there. If there was no housekeeping for the apartments, I wish we were told. Otherwise the lobby and hallways were clean.

That said this is a beach hotel and it reflects in its cleanliness. The green floor was two colors, green and black, but given the shapes of the black spots, I don't believe it was meant to be both colors. The bedding seemed to be between a white and off white color with an aged yellow mixed in. The toilet seemed to have stains on it from lid to seat, which is rather disgusting. At least the shower was clean which is always important. However, the shower's drain could not handle the sand or hair that ended up all over the tub after one shower. It's unpleasant to be showering with your hair and sand floating around the tub, and women with long hair know that it inevitable to not lose a strand or two while showering. After getting out of the shower you are expected to use such small towel. I just make 5 feet and the towels barely covered me from chest to bottom, which is uncomfortable if you're staying with a boyfriend or even your father. The bed was somewhat hard, but after a long day at the beach, it's hardly noticeable. However, the television would cut out while watching the Olympics and the wi-fi was extremely spotty as it is completely public. Perhaps the worst part of the stay was the fact that our room was not cleaned. We had asked the cleaning staff to come back in a few minutes because we were collecting our things and were still using the room. She had talked to both my boyfriend and myself. We both passed her sitting and talking with other staff members, which should have given the indication that we were out of our room. However, when we returned that evening the room had still not been cleaned and no one had brought the extra pillow I had requested. I called to ask for the pillow again and when I walked to the front desk I mentioned that the room had not been cleaned. The lady at the front desk said that it happens often and that they had gone for the day. When I explained that I had seen them sitting outside chatting, she merely said that she believed me and handed me towels. There was hardly and apology and nothing to compensate for the now sandy room. Needless to say, I showered with my flip flops on that night to avoid the sand that now lined the tub. I feel it's also important to stress how thin the walls are between the rooms. At any point in the day you can hear the rooms next to you and above you, which is uncomfortable and if you have rude neighbors as we did, you will be woken up early in the morning. If you are looking for a hotel based only on location this hotel is a great one. It is right on the boardwalk, but the beach never seems to get to crowded. It is also near the inlet and it's not a far walk either way to check out some of the sites of Ocean City. That said, in the future, I will always make sure to book earlier so that I will not have to book again at this hotel.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charltte", "Title": "\u201cGreat Ocean City hotel\u201d", "Author": "Pat S", "ReviewID": "UR135658492", "Content": "We have stayed here 2 years in a row.

We are from VA and were looking for a spot in Ocean City. I found the Atlantic Hotel through a Google search and checked them out. We called them to check prices and availability. They had some rooms available and the price was definitely right, so we booked it. All they require to reserve the room is a deposit of the first night's stay, though you can pay the entire amount ahead of time if you wish. Be aware that like most beach hotels, price varies depending on holidays and which part of the beach season it is. This hotel also is fully booked months in advance, so don't expect to call and get a room for next week. Staff is very nice, with the exception of your rotten tomato here and there, which you would expect anywhere. The rooms are very clean. My wife, two kids, and I got a double queen room with a fridge and microwave. When we went this year, we requested the same room we had last year, and they happily made that happen. Our room was on the second floor, ocean front, and they had upgraded the room we stayed in with a flat panel TV since we stayed last year. Some mention they don't have a complimentary breakfast, but one shouldn't expect this because of the price point. If you want to stay at a much higher priced hotel, I'm sure you'll get that \"complimentary\" breakfast. If you're looking for a great, family owned hotel, with a home town feeling, decent prices, and that's clean, this is place for you. My Only Call-outs 1. There isn't a general access elevator, so if you're on the second floor, prepare for a hike. It's 50 steps from the parking lot to the second floor. With it being four of us and staying for 5 days, we had a lot of stuff. The staff brought us out a cart which we loaded our stuff on, and took us up on the staff elevator, which was nice. 2. The bathroom is very small. You have to sit sideways on the toilet because of where the door is at. I spent the least amount of my time in the bathroom, so definitely not a deal breaker for me. 3. Ocean City is a late night city, so we did get a good bit of noise in the hallway late and night and early in the morning, but this isn't fault of the hotel, I would expect this anywhere. My kids are 4 and 5 and the hallway noise did not disturb them over the noise of the TV and the AC, so this wasn't too much of an issue for us.

It has a pool & there are places inside to relax,read a book etc. Now some reasons that it's not a 5 star hotel. They only have a service elevator. Guest can use this but the staff must work it.

Overall we were quite pleased with the room. Stayed in Room 7 with two Queen beds and a micro/fridge. This room is in a great location. It is on the ground floor with the entrance being from the outside courtyard. There are only 2 rooms with access from the courtyard --Room 7 and Room 11. The outside shower to wash off sand is located in the courtyard and if you walk out of the room and turn to the right you walk directly into the hotel and then out to the parking lot (no stairs to climb). If you walk out of the room to the left you go down a small corridor and end up on Somerset Street and you are then literally steps to the boardwalk and beach. We had no problems with noise -- the air conditioner provides quite a lot of background noise-- but we never heard any noise from the boardwalk. Also, there did not seem to be a lot of foot traffic through the corridor. We were out of the room quite a bit, but back in by 10 or 11 each night and never noticed a lot of noise or foot traffic. The parking lot is large and we only moved the car 2 times and were always able to find a parking spot. You are able to walk to most locations and we chose to ride the Boardwalk Tram and Bus to see the further outskirts of Ocean City. The room was clean and we always had plenty of towels. I didn't think the water got very hot and the water pressure was low in the shower. The main issue I had with our room was that there were no hooks anywhere in the room to dry your towels. We had brought our own beach towels and our room was furnished with the 2 beds, dresser, micro/fridge and 1 chair. There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels on and the sink was located next to the bed so the bathroom has no countertop to set anything on . The bathroom consists of the toilet, bathtub/shower and one towel rack-- no counter space. I was at a loss as to where to hang up towels, suits, etc. Luckily we brought several suits so it worked out. There were a few hangers in the open closet area but we were using those to hang clothing on. I told the front desk clerk about possibly installing hooks in the future and she said that they had several people request them recently and also an over the door hook. Hopefully they will head these suggestions and install them. I also learned that each room is funished differently and that the front desk has a list of what furniture each room contains. I learned that Room 11 in the courtyard was identical to ours but also had a small table and chairs located in the room. If I would have known this, I would have requested room 11 as it was difficult with the only place to sit in our room being the beds or the one straight back chair. Also, Room 7 and 11 are slightly larger than some of the other rooms. Be sure to bring: hairdryer (not one in the room), iron (never saw one) They do not have coffeemakers in the room. Coffee is available in the lobby every morning. Overall, we had a nice stay and the location cannot be beat. The pool was a nice size for our kids and the depth was great. It wasn't overcrowded. The porch overlooking the Boardwalk is really nice and fun to watch the people as well as the Slingshot ride at Jolly Roger. I watched 2 beautiful sunrises on the deck.

The worst of it is when I told the manager when we were checking out, she seemed genuinely concerned and had the head of the cleaning staff go and check it out. That woman went upstairs to check it out, and came down and looked us in the eye and essentially blamed us for the blood and said we ruined her sheets. After being spoken to in such a rude and embarrassing way, I went to speak to the manager who sided with her, saying \"if you have a problem with it, then you should just not come back\". This was the worst experience of customer service i have ever had. Obviously if it was her fault that the sheets were bloody, but also failed to get changed with this obvious mistake, she clearly was looking to get out of this huge failure to DO HER JOB! But then to blame us for it and to treat us like the common criminal was ridiculous. If we had ruined her sheets, why would we TELL them about it?? I will never go back and here.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hughesville, MD", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the beach\u201d", "Author": "Fishtherapy", "ReviewID": "UR116516440", "Content": "Atlantic hotel was not a five star hotel but it was perfect for the Ocean City.

These beds were the smallest queens I have ever seen. I think some of the rooms may be decent and we just got stuck with a bad one. The housekeeping staff would leave doors open as they cleaned them so we could look inside as we were walking past. Some of these rooms looked really good compared to ours. One actually had a large flat screen tv. The inner door to our room would shake like someone was trying the door whenever someone would walk by. This got very annoying when trying to sleep.

Since the Atlantic got pretty good reviews on Tripadvisor we decided to give it a try. The best thing about this hotel is its location. It's right at the beginning of the boardwalk. The hotel has a WONDERFUL deck overlooking the boardwalk and, obviously, facing the beach and ocean. My husband and I enjoyed sitting on the deck to people watch in the evenings and we even watched the sunrise one morning. The hotel itself is very, very quaint. The Atlantic was one of the first, if not the first, hotel on the boardwalk. The hotel managers have maintained the hotel in such a way that it is easy to imagine what it was like in the days when it was first built -- but in a good way!! (Please be warned, if you are looking for a fancy, modern, luxury hotel, do not stay here. You will be disappointed!!) I have the pros and cons of this hotel listed below but I did want to commment on some of the comments others have made about this hotel. Some people have complained about having to use the stairs. Unless you have some physical limitation or health condition that prevents you from doing it, who really can complain about having to climb stairs. The hotel is only three stories, for Pete's sake! All the food that you eat on the boardwalk needs to be burned off somehow!! There is an elevator at this hotel but it is an old-fashioned one that requires the staff there to operate it. We only used it to take our luggage in and out of the hotel. Also, people have complained about not being able to find the hotel. We had no problems finding it when we entered, \" 1 Wicomico Street, Ocean City, Maryland\" into our GPS system. It took us right there. As for the sink in the room -- definitely weird, but not a deal breaker. Pros: Location, location, location!!!! Sundeck was awesome Hotel and our room were clean -- but I did find little bit of mildew on grout between a few of the shower tiles -- not a huge deal but I noticed it. Staff was friendly and helpful Quiet, family hotel Cons: A/C -- pretty noisy but didn't keep us awake at night. Wifi is not free.

We originally booked the Atlantic Hotel because of the rate and location, location, location! My family and my best friends family booked a 3 queen bed room to sleep 4 adults, 1 preteen and an infant. My best friend's family had to cancel on the trip, so we re-booked to a 1 queen bed room a month before with no problems. We arrived at the Atlantic on a Sunday evening around 9pm and had a lot of luggage due to traveling with an infant. Checked in and got a room on the 3rd floor deck level because it had rocking chairs that would be useful in putting our baby to sleep. Not the best idea. This hotel has an elevator that is old, and only used for luggage and housekeeping. They did have someone help me get all of my luggage to the room even at 10pm. The room was small but clean with a bed and breakfast type of feel. With a portable crib and luggage it was tight. The bathrooms were very clean, but be prepared: in alot of the rooms the sink is in the ROOM, not in the bathroom and there is very little counter space except for the drawer cabinet top. It was a bit awkward but workable. The space issue was not. I went to the front desk and asked for a room that had more space such as a 2 queen bed room. They checked and said they had none for that night but to check in the morning, as some people were checking out the next day. I did so and they accommodated me with a 1st floor 2 queen bed room in the courtyard in the middle of the hotel. This was perfect! We got room 11, which I recommend for anyone with children at stroller age. It had more space with caddy-corner beds and a 2 chair table with the sink IN the bathroom. And you can walk right out of your door with the stroller to the street that leads to the beach. There are three down falls with this room. Less security, everyone coming back from the beach comes back by this room and if it rains like it did on us, you are outside in it trying to get to your room. Another plus to the courtyard is the wash station for the beach with a hose and shower are right outside your room to wash you and all of your things. This room was very clean but had a slightly musty smell near the front door. Housekeeping did a good enough job, my only complaint here was they did not vacuum every day. There is no free ice machine, so if you want ice it is .50 from the machine or 1.50 for a bag of ice from the front desk. We swam in the pool a few times, it is nice but small. It has a shallow 1/2ft area for small children, and goes as deep as 5ft. We were able to get lunch and dinner easily steps from our room on the boardwalk, but breakfast proved more difficult. The hotel itself is nice and kept clean, but is not modern at all, do not expect Holiday inn, again expect bed and breakfast that is literally steps from the main area of the boardwalk. Parking can be bad at night because after 9pm everyone comes in to sleep and the lot is not large. They only allow one car per room and that is a good thing. One thing to be aware of, the doors are regular doors, with a key you have to use to lock the door on your way out, no hotel key cards here! Lastly, this hotel is right in the middle of the main part of the Ocean City boardwalk but don't be afraid of noise at night, it really is very quiet! Tips: Get a parking spot before 9pm, it fills fast. Request a ground floor room, especially if you have infants or kids. Get a room with a fridge and microwave, it will save on the ice buying and keep your drinks cold. Bring your own pillow if possible. Try Thrashers fries! Use the tram to get to far parts of the boardwalk. Cons: No on site laundry. Sinks in room not in the bathroom in some units. Rooms are on the small side. Little counter space. Small parking lot. No free ice machine. Elevator is for service only, not passenger traffic. Pillows aren't great, bring your own if you can. Food on boardwalk is expensive. (Not the fault of hotel, just good to know.) Not much security, anyone can walk anywhere in the hotel or pool area with no way to know if they should be there. Pros: Location, location, and location! Great rates, best in the area on the boardwalk! Clean rooms and decent beds. Can open windows all the way for fresh air. Decent air conditioning units. Free parking for one car. Very accommodating and helpful staff. Steps from the busiest part of the boardwalk and fishing pier. Steps from the beach. Steps from any food you may want, except for few breakfast choices. Quiet even though it's so close to the boardwalk. Nice deck with rocking chairs over the boardwalk to relax and people watch. Nice but small pool area. Steps from the tram and bus lines.(We rode the boardwalk tram but not the buses.) Very close to two amusement areas.

But then I went to trip advisor and they rated this hotel pretty high and i decided to give it a try and cancelled my reservations at the comfort suites but still very skeptical. The 4 night stay at the Atlantic was a grand total of $525.00. If you check in on a sunday the 4th night was free. I was nervous the whole way down from upstate N.Y.

The outside of the hotel was neat and clean. The pool was small but the water was warm and clean. They had comfortable lounge chairs and a outside bar which offered $5 pina colidas and slushies for the kids. Like others have stated this is not the Marriott which i have stayed in. You just have to go there and not expect all the extras. I even brought my flash light and inspected for bed bugs and there was NOTHING. I pulled the mattress and sheets up and looked several times. Everything was clean. Sure I could find alot to say negative like small rooms, no balcony, low water pressure but for $500 for a 4 night stay on the ocean i am not complainig. Every morning in the lobby my husband and i would get a cup of coffee and sit on the sundeck at the end of the hall, which was never crowded. To get into your room they still have the old lock and key. which was a little hassle. I would recommend hanging your clothes on a hanger and putting them in the closet due to the lack of space in the room for suitcases. because of the money we saved staying there,we were able to spend more money on seafood dinners, jetskis,parasailing etc. After walking the boardwalk at night and seeing what else there was to offer I made a wise choice by staying at the Atlantic Hotel.

This was our first time staying at this hotel. We picked this hotel because of the location. We wanted to be on the boardwalk (near the end) and not spend a fortune. This is one of the original hotels (over 100 years old). The hotel is very old and full of character. It's a really neat place but it does have a few 'quirks'. If you don't know what to expect you might be in for a surprise. The rooms and bathrooms are small. A \"typical\" modern hotel room would be much larger than these rooms. The hotel has one elevator but it is quite old and I believe you need to have the front desk turn it on for you. We never used it. The hotel is 4 floors. The first is ground/street level. You go up one flight to the lobby. From there you have two more stories. We were on the top floor and didn't mind the stairs. If you have small children I would suggest requesting ground level. (They also list they have handicap accessible rooms. I believe these are the ground/street level.) The staff was very kind and helpful. We arrived early (11:30 ish). Although check in is not until 3 pm the staff gave us our packing permit early and pushed our room to the top of the list to be prepared. Our room was ready by 12:30 pm. The room was small but clean and comfortable. We had the 1 queen bed (no fridge or microwave). There was the bed, a dresser with a tv, small night stand, small desk and chair and pedestal sink. Yes, we did have the sink in the bedroom. You had to walk out of the bathroom and around the bed to get to the sink. One of the quirks of this place. It never bothered us. Since it was just the two of us we opted for the 1 bedroom room. Walking down the halls we were able to peak into some other rooms. The 2 bedroom rooms looked like they were a nice size. I even saw one with a portable crib setup and it looked like there was still enough room to walk around comfortably. The hotel does have a small pool. It was kept very clean and was a wonderful spot to cool off away from the boardwalk and beach crowds. Often there were only one or two families down there. It never seemed to be overly crowded.

This place is a great place to stay with the idea that this is not a resort, but a place to relax in the evening and sleep at night.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cYiiiikes!\u201d", "Author": "greenerpaztures", "ReviewID": "UR71601763", "Content": "I just got back from staying at this place. There were four of us in a room, and we each paid $120 for a Friday and Saturday night. I guess this is cheap for Ocean City during peak beach hours; however, I would have happily paid several hundred more to stay somewhere decent. While the hotel is in a prime location located on the boardwalk and across from the Jolly Roger amusement park on the boardwalk, the hotel is a total dump. Upon entering the room, I was immediately worried that the place would be infested with bedbugs and/or cockroaches. The mattresses were as thin as a crib mattress and the sheets and pillows were stained. The towels were the size of a hand towel and only one per person. If you wanted additional towels, you have to bring your soiled towels back to the front desk and they'll give you more. The sink is located in the room and the shower and toilet are enclosed in what feels like a tiny half bath. Be prepared to dry and change in the room, not the bathroom. The management was rude and they don't allow you to use the elevator. So be prepared to lug your heavy suitcases up a couple flights of stairs.

I don't get why so many people gave it a perfect 5, because it definitely wasn't perfect. It wasn't bad either though. First off, it was hard to find because they don't provide an exact address -- you need to turn down Wicomoco St and then turn left on S Baltimore Ave and the parking lot is right next to Wild Bill's, which you should be able to spot easily. Parking seemed ok for us, we only left once a day for dinner and came back pretty early. Now about the hotel room -- the bathroom is SO small, you can't just walk in and close the door, you have to maneuver around to close the door (and I am a small person!). It's so small, they had to stick the sink outside of the bathroom (and awkwardly, there was no place to hang a towel by the sink). The water temp in the shower kept fluctuating a lot, hot then cold...hadn't experienced that in a regular hotel before. The worst part was that we had a hard time sleeping the first night because you could hear people talking in the hallway as loud as if they were in your room. We discovered the next day that you can close a vent on the door (don't ask why there would even be a vent on the door) and turn on the AC (was not automatically turned on) which helped drown out some of the outside noise, so luckily we were able to sleep the second night. On the positive side, the room seemed pretty clean, which is more than I can say for the hotel I stayed in last year. The tv is small and old. No hair blow dryer. They didn't provide new shampoo/conditioner if you used any. Oh and another weird thing, the agreement that you sign when you check-in says that if you want new towels you have to bring your dirty ones to the front desk...though it seemed like the cleaning people changed our towels for us anyway. Next time I go to Ocean City, I'm going to check out other hotels before considering booking this one again. If I had to, I would stay here again over other hotels considering the price & and great location, but there are probably some better options available. Pros: -Awesome location, right by the amusement park -Priced well compared to other hotels in the area -Pretty clean -Firm bed Cons: -Noisy -No balcony for room (can't see much out window) -No free internet -Tiny bathroom", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe best Value for your Dollar in Ocean City MD.\u201d", "Author": "Cwcarpenter3", "ReviewID": "UR69696126", "Content": "Bottom line, there is no other Hotel in Ocean City that you can beat for the value!

The location of the hotel is great. It is located right off the boardwalk in downtown Ocean City where you are in walking distance of almost every major attraction. The rooms are a old time bed and breakfast style with basic tv. Not a big deal if you are planning on spending more time outside you room on vacation than inside your room.

Gotta love this hotel. Third time I've stayed there. Not fancy (based on modern or 'chain' hotel/motels), but very clean and right at the beginning (boardwalk) of everything OC has to offer. Probably more importantly, can't beat the price. Price - about half of the 'chain' hotels. I made 'quick' reservations this past Friday, and the price was half of what the other 'chain' hotels wanted for the same size room. Most of the chain hotels offered a deck for each room, but for $200 less, I'll take the shared deck and pocket the difference. Shared 'deck'..(as opposed to a private ocean view balcony), but I think there weren't more than 6 people on the deck any time I went out. Which is to say, you won't/don't necessarily have a \"ocean view\" room with a private balcony (although it looks like they have four rooms with a 'view' from the deck side end-of-unit rooms). Personally, I'm not sure I'd like any of those rooms. I believe they are a little smaller than the one we had this time around. And, since these four rooms adjoin the 'deck', you 'may' possibly have an issue with possible rowdy folks who 'might' want to party on the deck during the evening hours. Haven't seen that myself though, so it wouldn't be a concern for me. Deck \"officially\" closes at 12 A.M.) Location - right on the boardwalk at Wicomico St. (Across from Ripley's) Great view of ocean from two level deck. Clean. No strange smells (non-smoking). Housekeeping staff is very good. Our room appears to have been recently painted. Parking next to hotel. Haven't had a problem with parking spaces yet. Took two vehicles this time around. This time, our room was at the back of the hotel overlooking the pool. Very quiet. Micro/refrig/Air. Not a big pool, but I don't think I saw more than half a dozen people in it at any given time. So you won't be cramped for swimming space. Questions: bishop01us@yahoo.com I did take some photos, but will wait to see if anyone wants them.
