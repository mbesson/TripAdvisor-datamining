The resort did not dissapoint, and made me contiune to want to return to the JW. Arriving to the resort along the long driveway sets the tone for the elegance of the hotel. The lobby has a domed ceiling with a nice fountain in the middle. Makes you feel that this place is gonna be perfect to relax for the weekend. Reserved the room with the AAA resort package, which included parking, breakfast, and a $25 resort credit. The room, was perfect...Crisp, upscale design, with fluffy beds and modern furniture. Even a nice sound machine clock, perfect for putting you to sleep. Bathroom has a smallish tub in addition to a separate shower. Toiletries have changed since the last visit, and I miss the citrus and mint scents that used to be in the rooms. Turn down service attendant was super friendly and seemed to want to give me 10 of everything...little chocolates, towels, shampoos. Relaxing was easy here, with a great feature pool and several hammocks and adirondack chairs lining the pathway between the JW and the Ritz Carlton. Service by the pool was attentive and timely, with some pretty decent burgers and salads (although a little pricey as would be expected) Children were for the most part behaved, and seemed to be secluded to another part of the pool. Breakfast, which is a buffet, and included in the room package, is pretty standard. The french toast is \"vanilla scented\" and one of the better options. This place can get pretty busy, with lines for omlettes, french toast, and waffles, so either go earlier, or be prepared for a line. Location is great if you will be visiting several themeparks in the area, centrally located between Disney and Universal (About 15 mins without traffic), and right off the Parkway from SeaWorld (5 mins).", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTerrific, if it were not for the large \"sales-group\" meetings overwhelming the place.\u201d", "Author": "kstarrzzz", "ReviewID": "UR126979559", "Content": "I really love the JW Marriott hotels, but the large groups they host can really ruin the atmosphere.

We are back again this year for a corporate event. Of the many places we have traveled the past few years, this ranks in the top 5!

The hotel staff are warm and gracious and always make you feel welcome. There are lots of activities to keep most anyone happy. You can partake in Fitness classes or an assortment of spa tretments or get in your daily workout. They also offer kayak paddling on the grande lake along with a guided tour of Shingle Creek which runs along the back side of the property. There is also a lovely golf course on site for the golf enthusiast. If you are traveling with little ones, the warm pool with its zero entry area and lazy river will keep them entertained all day. Oh ,not to mention the sand play area with climbing equipment and the giant chess board on the lawn. The on site eateries offer delicious and nutritious, sensible food choices for all ages. All of this is also in close proximity to the theme parks as well. In short, this is just an ideal spot to stay.

They were facing us, talking and cutting up but took about 10 minutes to even come over to us. We seated ourselves. Food was okay but the server wouldn't have known that because she took another 15 minutes to come back to our table once we got our food. So much for getting that side of ranch I decided I wanted... Later that day we went to a baseball game at the ESPN complex and decided to order something off the \"overnight\" menu when we got back.

They asked us to go enjoy the resort and that they would call me phone when the room was ready. At around 3pm we received a call asking if we would like to get an original booked suite or wait for 30 minutes for them to finish the cleaning of the presidential suite. We chose to wait, who wouldn't? By 4:30 pm my wife and I were starting to get agitated as our kids had not napped yet and I wanted to shower and eat something. So we went to the front desk to complain. The room was still not ready. They apologized and after much complaining they sent us to the restaurant with a 75.00$ credit for us to eat and relax. During dinner they told us our room was ready and that after dinner someone from the front desk was going to escort us to our room. After dinner they greeted our kids with some free stuffed animals and rather large cookies for the kids to enjoy and brought us up to the suite on the 21st floor.

This is hands down the best Marriott property I've ever laid eyes on. Enter the lobby with marble galore and griffins representing the JW Brand. I've stayed at a lot of really great places, but this was jaw dropping. I had to double take and say...\"this is a Marriott?\" Note, this property is shared by the Ritz Carlton Hotel & Golf Club...so you'd expect it to be luxurious. The location of the hotel is very good. For my trips to Disney, I really prefer to be as close to the parks as possible. The property is about 10 minutes away from the gates, however it's worth every second of travel time. We used valet, they were nice and very quick. There is self parking somewhere, but I really didn't feel like tromping who knows how far back and forth. It's a nice hotel...treat yourself to some valet parking. As mentioned before - WOW...this place is downright amazing. Our room was great. Very good sized, nice accommodations, bedding was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was large and quite opulent. We had a pool view room with a real treat. If you are in a pool view, you also overlook the Ritz Carlton Members Only Golf Club. #1 FAVORITE at this hotel....THE POOL. Holy Cow! You've got at least 4 or 5 pools all of which are connected by a lazy river. I'm bald headed, so the following comment is really important to me....the river is almost completely covered in \"jungle canopy\". Very well shaded and the river actually moves at a good clip. Hop on your tubes and enjoy the ride. During peak seasons, like when we visited, they serve drinks to people in the river from the side. Some of the pools are for sports, one for babies, one quite and etc. Additionally, the group activities for kids was OUTSTANDING! We had a smore campfire, coloring activities poolside, lemonaides and frozen juices during the hot of the day. They did a bang up job and you didn't have to pay for every kids activity...some that included you walking away with a physical object like a painted coconut or something. We were there for Memorial Day and had no clue they did a special celebration in conjunction with the Ritz. WOW!! A fireworks display that was a least 15-20 minutes long and presented by the hotels for our private viewing. The entire weekend of this holiday was just remarkable.

My expectation, prior to arrival, was probably higher than it should have been, considering that this property is also attached to a Ritz Carlton. I've mixed some good with the bad for this review. The hotel is pretty remote to any other facilities, so I felt like I was trapped on an island. To get anywhere, you had to use their \"Towne Cars\" because they don't have normal taxi service. It was cost prohibitive to leave the property. But pretty cost prohibitive to stay on property as well. My first night, I chose to order room service, as I had just come from another week long business trip in Tampa. The room did not have a room service menu, so I called down to see if someone could bring one to my room. After a 1/2 hour, nobody showed up. I then got redressed and went down to the front desk to see if they had one or could have one sent up. They said they would have someone bring one up, but again it was a \"no show.\" While I was downstairs, I inquired with the hostess at Primo if I could order something to go, I was told that they don't normally do that and if I really wanted to, she would check with the Chef. I thought this was pretty odd as most hotel restaurants would allow for this, without question. Upon returning to my room, I finally found a housekeeper, who was doing turn down service, who offered to bring a menu to my room. By this time, I was pretty hungry and very thankful that she came right back with a menu. The room service menu is not that desirable. I ordered a chicken sandwich and cup of soup for a grand total of $36+ (which normally I would have ordered for lunch, not dinner). I opted not to rent a vehicle while in Orlando, as the cost of parking did not include in & out privileges ... beware to those families that want to leave the property for a day at the park ... you'll be told \"it's hotel policy.\" Upon arrival, the front desk staff was extremely friendly. The pool facilities were nice, however, there were way too many lounge chairs, some with cushions, some without, and most were shaded. The food and beverage outlets did a great job. I really enjoyed both dinners at Primo ... best part of the trip. Quench (pool bar & grill) was my daily lunch. The bartenders/servers were very friendly. The staff at Starbucks was very helpful ... only place you can get a cup of ice to go. The view from my hotel room (on 8th floor) was outstanding (golf course & pool view, even some fireworks at night). Beds in the room were not comfortable ... kind of hard and all of the pillows were too soft/feathery. Banquet staff was extremely nice, however, the food was very mediocre in the meeting space. This could have something to do with the conference organizers and their budget, but it definitely could have been much better. First day's boxed lunch had a huge bun with half of a half of chicken breast, super small bean salad and an apple ... definitely saving money there. Next day's boxed equally disappointing. Surprised me that there were no water stations or ice provided in the exhibit hall or available during our events, until the very last morning (which was only from 7a-10:30a). They finally brought in water containers, probably because so many people complained of dehydration. I'm not a soda drinker, so having to force myself to drink a Diet Coke with my lunch every day was less than satisfying. As expected from a high end property, I felt that everything was overpriced and that I was being nickle and dimed to death the entire 5 days. On the day of departure, I was told that the Towne Car service (only option for transportation) to the airport was $45, however, when I was dropped off at the airport, the cost was $48. You may want to inform the front desk of this change. Lastly, the Fed Ex shop in the hotel charged $25 as a \"handling fee.\" A little extreme considering that I had my own packaging and label. The service person didn't have to \"handle\" anything. They just had to have the driver pick up my exhibit container.

The pool area is beautiful and lush, with landscaping that makes it more intimate and hides how big a pool complex it is. Frankly, it's less expensive than on-property Disney hotels, and you get a lot more. If you have a car, Seito sushi is one exit up the highway, and there is a wonderful Cuban place about 3 miles down John Young, which runs right in front of the hotel. Food choices inside the hotel are good as well, although not inexpensive. Citron, on the first floor, has a great breakfast buffet. At $20, it's a little pricey for the kids, but really nice for adults. Even the pool food quality is very good, with nice sandwiches and salads, and fruity drinks to have you happy in your chaise. Oh, by the way, the pool is always nice and warm. I can't stand cold hotel pools, and I've been here at four or five times across the year, and the pool is always 80.

The meals arrived with fries...We were happy...lol. After we woke up I was looking forward to the breakfast buffet as it was included. The quality of the food has gone down a few notches. The french toast wasn't nearly as good. The yogurt was an off brand my kids wouldn't even eat.Seemed as though everything was downgraded a bit. Don't get me wrong..the buffet is very good just not stellar as it was just a few months ago. I am a business man so I inquired with a few people and they told me they hired a new service food manager recently and some of the other patrons were also inquiring. The pool was beautiful as always and the kiddos had a wonderful time. Drinks are overpriced so I would just grab you own.They have plenty of stores with in a mile or so. 12-15 dollars for a drink in a small plastic cup...plus automatic gratuity is absurd. The kids activities have gone from excellent to dismal. They had a make your own superhero cape activity and they only had three capes to color. They didn't have enough markers for the other decorating activities either. The giant chess set is broken. the foosball table is just gross. The rest of the grounds were superb and beautiful. The only other issue is the food service at lunch. They had some of the best pulled pork nachos I have ever had. Now you just get nachos with dipping sauce in a plastic tray. The food service is abysmal. The reason I rate this hotel very good is that it is just that...very good. The days of beyond great have passed. If I do stay here again I will inquire about the food service manager before I make the trek. The grounds and truly beautiful. The Hotel is gorgeous.

You pay for parking, the internet, inter-tubes for the lazy river, the kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 activities, etc. The food itself is okay given normal standards, but given the expectation of a JW Marriot it comes short. There are really no local restaurant choices as the location is a bit off any of the main drag. We ate at a TGI Fridays one night and had better service than the entire stay at the JW. Although somewhat close to Universal, it is a bit further to the Disney Properties. Lastly, it was my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday during our stay and I stopped by the front desk to arrange for a balloon to be delivered to our room.

I highly recommend getting a view of the pool and lake. Our room and bathroom was spotless and restocked everyday. The hotel had several restaurants, coffee shops, and really great boutique shops. The pools and lazy river was amazing, so much fun. The restaurants were great, food was delicious but was a bit pricey, but it's expected in a resort like this. Every single night when we returned to our room they turned down the beds and the best part was the alarm clock in the room had soothing nature sounds and each night they would turn on one of the sounds and put chocolates on our pillow. Everyone slept great, the beds were extremely comfortable. The outside of the hotel was just as great. Besides the pools, there was also a bar poolside, the lake was great and very quiet, they had chairs and benches right by the lake to just sit and relax.

Of all the hotels we have stayed at, this was the nicest. Mind you the Ritz is next door and shares resort property with the Marriot... (They are owned by the same company). I have stayed at the Ritz too and I prefer the Marriot. The hotel is \"GRANDE\" and has a huge lobby guilded in light marble with a fountain. Yet, for all its Grandeur, it is less pretentious than the Ritz. The rooms are kept new in appearance and the bathrooms are worthy of a four star hotel. Our room was on the 16th floor and overlooked the Orlando area which was spectacular albeit flat and largely undeveloped as is much of Florida. The highlight of the visit was the Breakfast (which was included in our room rate). The breakfast was conducted in a large room that was the spitting image of a Parisian Bistro. A buffet runs the length of the room and overlooks the garden. It was sumptuous and comprehensive. If you are a European, you will feel right at home. Beautifully prepared cold cuts, salmon, sliced onions, fresh fruit, muesli and fresh toasty pastries were presented. If you are American, you too will be taken care of. There was a pancake/waffle/crepe station, an omlette station, eggs benedict, bacon, toast, hot oatmeal, cold cereals... watermelon juice. And on. Service was friendly and professional. The grounds of the resort are extensive and are shared with the Ritz. So too is the weight room/Spa facility. There is a lake with an extensive exercise trail circling the entire resort and in between is a pool that is intersected by a \"lazy river\". While the resort is very Kid friendly, it did not seem overrun by the little creatures! If there are shortcomings or things one should be aware of here are a few: In contrast to the Ritz the Hotel is busy with conventions and the lobby/restaurant bar was packed and noisy when we were there (The Ritz tends to be a tad more intimate). The Main Dinner Restaurant \"Primo\" was nicely decorated and had excellent service but the food was not worth the high price. One last thing to be aware of: parking is an up charge and so is wifi.

The second negative is that because of the remoteness of the property, the prices for food are exorbitant. Just the breakfast buffet will put you out $24.

It is just down the street (same exit) from SeaWorld, so it would be very convenient if you plan on visiting there. Because the JW shares a massive tract of land with the Ritz-Carlton, it is somewhat of a quiet getaway, not situated in a bustling metro environment. This makes for very easy traffic and parking.

Property: The property is massive and was definitely built with conferences and conventions in mind. Though the JW and Ritz are nearly a quarter-mile apart, they are connected via hallways and hallways of conference space, creating an air-conditioned walkway between the two hotels.

Then of course we went to our room which was large with 2 double beds, nice clean bathroom with separate shower and marble counters. We got a view of the back of the hotel although we were offered an upgrade of 30USD a night for a view of the pool, not worth it as we were on the 18 floor and amazing view of the grounds anyway. Housekeeping was amazing and the turn down service each night a great touch! We are not rich by no means but when i go away i do like to stay in a nice hotel whereas my husband thinks its a place to lay our heads! The bar was quite expensive for nightly drinks in American standards (although 12usd for a nice glass of red or 6.50 for a bottle of beer not bad for Irish standards) so we didn't tend to stay there for more than one, the restaurants were also very expensive on site but the location of the hotel was so close to all restaurants we decided to eat out every morning/night elsewhere. The pool are was open to 11pm each night and my daughter spend a lot of time in the pool and lazy river.. i could go on and on but I highly recommend this hotel.

My stay was excellent but definitely had its cons. The decor and setup of the lobby is incredible; all doubts about the rating of this place disappear upon entry. There are plenty of bus-boys waiting at the entrance to help you with luggage and make you feel well accommodated. Service at the front desk was pretty good and understanding as well. They have an indoor Starbucks! That's pretty exclusive to me. The rooms are wonderfully sized and well-stocked with useful furniture. It was nice to see that I didn't have to pay for the room locker; most other places charge for this. I LOVED the bathroom setup; it's about as big as the room itself and has a tub for soaking and a stand-up shower for bathing. Very relaxing! Rooms situated on the high floors have fantastic views of the campus; I'd get these if the option comes up. Unfortunately, not everything during my stay was comforting. The hotel, while connected to a Ritz on a HUGE campus, is, relatively, in the middle of nowhere. The nearest Walgreens was a hair over a mile away (the concierge told me it was \"across the street\" so I walked it in my sandals and shorts...not pleasant) and getting to any restaurants outside of the hotel is at least a 10 minute drive. There are plenty of taxis available to get to Universal Studios or Disney, though. One could rent a car (which can be surprisingly cheap here in Orlando), but $18/day self-parking makes it a somewhat expensive exercise. This is fine for resort getaways, business trips or personal time, but a complete bummer for those looking to explore the city (of which there apparently isn't much of). This might be obvious to some, but the food here is expensive. All of the dinner entrees were over $20, which can rack up quickly after drinks. The quality of the dishes were amazing (though I've had similar experiences for less here in NYC), but the service was surprisingly poor. On my second to last day here, I ordered a leek salmon bagel for breakfast but, impressively, got everything except salmon...after waiting 20 minutes for the meal and about 10 minutes before that for a server. I had to wait another 10 minutes after that to get my correct dish, and nothing was comped off the bill to boot (like other places would've done...how do you forget the salmon on a salmon bagel?) In another instance, my colleagues and I had to get a server ourselves to get any attention and waited another 10 minutes after that for our drinks. Surprisingly unacceptable for the prices we paid. Finally, I was even more surprised that wireless internet costs ~$16/day to use here. How is it that motels that cost significantly less have free wi-fi whereas a four-star hotel with a conference center does not? For the sake of completeness, the Peabody had a free, though slow, and paid wireless points for its patrons. While I enjoyed my stay here, there were too many little issues that I didn't get from sleeping at hotels of much \"lower\" caliber. If I had to come to Orlando for a conference, I'll probably opt to stay somewhere a little more active...and cheaper at that.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alabama", "Title": "\u201cMeh.

I have stayed at the ritz next door and this hotel is much larger, but still has a lot too offer. They charge you for parking but if you stay at a 4 star+ resort that is typical. The ritz carlton spa is actually located in between the 2 properties. You take the long walkway where the convention area is. The ritz spa is fantastic. I would highly recommend.

The lazy river is fun, but the pool drink service is a bit slow and inconsistent. The rooms at the JW are some of the nicest I have experienced at a Marriott property. It is almost at a ritz level. The bathroom is very large and well appointed with a seperate shower and tub. We had a balcony overlooking the pool which was nice. In regards to food, normans at the ritz (again, you can get to the ritz by walking through the convention space) is excellent....expensive...but excellent.

First, let me say that Marriott needs an updated, user friendly entrance to Grande Lakes. If you are traveling late in the evening, the signs are difficult to see, and it is easy to make a wrong turn into the self-parking area....which will cost you $14.00 per day. Next, if you park at the door to check-in, be prepared to fight off the vultures that want to treat you as if you are severely handicapped....and that you have $$ to blow. We had one bag, and a kid at the door insisted he carry it to the room.....just for a few bucks. Third, the reservation we made months prior to the trip was incorrect. Even with the print-out, which included full-payment and the reservation number, we were told that the reservation was not in our name; it was keyed in as someone else's room. Therefore, we went from a Deluxe, two-bed queen room, looking over the lakes, to a Standard, king bed, looking at the entrance over-hang and the self-service parking lot. Let me continue....there are no vending machines.....anywhere. Only ice machines on each floor. The food at lunch today was over-priced: Caesar chicken salad: $14 and a Cuban sandwich $14. Wow......that's amost the price of a night at Carrabba's. Anyway, I digress......The rooms: Although the rooms look to be updated, they are over-crowded with furniture (king bed, two night stands, armoire (with TV and mini-bar), full-sized desk and rolling chair, a love seat and matching chair, and a coffee table.....all crammed in to 400 sq. ft.

We booked a AAA package that included self parking, breakfast, upgrade to lake view, and a $25 room credit per night. We used all of the above and our bill was exactly in order, everything subtracted just like it should be. I really liked this hotel. The room was okay, nothing bad (maybe questionable taste in decorating) but nothing amazing. The strong suit of the JW is its facilities. The pool with lazy river is one of the best I've seen in the US, maybe only behind Mandalay Bay in Vegas. It was fantastic how warm they heated it. There are 2 spa tubs (or maybe more I missed), ping pong, sand box for kiddos, extensive tropical gardens including their organic veggie patch, walking paths, fire pit, kayaking, volleyball, spa, Starbucks. The hotel was pretty full on Saturday night but even so we had no trouble finding pool loungers. The outdoor area is open till 11PM including the pool, a great feature. There are ample towels and no hassle of a towel card or anything like that, just take what you need. The gym in the Ritz is terrific, and no hassle using it if you are staying at the JW. You can also use the Ritz pool I understand, but why would you want to? This is a pricey hotel with extras, and I can't recommend strongly enough getting a package. The breakfast buffet is $24 PP. Our lunch was $45 (2 diet sodas & 2 wraps). I would guess parking would be in that range too. But that was all covered for us. Good deal. The location is right off International Drive with its restaurants, near to all things Disney, and Seaworld. Negatives: I'm a Rewards member with quite a few points under my belt and 7 Marriott nights JUST THIS MONTH, but they would only give me a late check out of 1PM after I explained I had an 8PM flight. That is pretty stingy and honestly the desk clerk was unpleasant about it, like I was bothering her by even asking. Yet the hotel was half empty, a quiet Monday. It would have cost them nothing to give me a few hours, and actually I probably would've purchased another of their $50 lunches. I walked away with a bad taste from that. Another negative: not enough pool umbrellas by far. Here's a great tip for you: you have to buy floatie tubes for the lazy river. But when families leave to check out they leave their tubes behind.

We are Marriott platinum members but there is no concierge lounge or breakfast credit that is offered since this Marriott is considered a \"resort\" - I found this pretty lame, but oh well! Pool is amazing. It's a very, very, VERY lazy river, but fun and relaxing all the same. The pool empties out into 4 pools. One pool has a basketball hoop, the other 2 have nothing and the last is a kiddie/wadding area. We had extra fun by taking our tubes and jumping up and down while in the \"river\" and creating our own waves... other people in the \"river\" loved it... everyone was laughing about it! You have to take your floaties up to your room at night (we stuck ours in the tub). If you leave them at the pool, the pool staff pops them. Our first night there the woman who was closing the pool told us to take them as she had to dispose of them - so we took a few. They cost $7.00 there, or you can buy some off-site and bring in. People were borrowing some at were laying around the pool (probably cause they thought the hotel owned them) and when I saw someone using ours, I was fine with it, but I guess other people could be mad about it. When you buy them, you write your name on it with permanent marker. People can smoke at the pool so be aware of this. There was also a lot of drinking going on as they have a \"buy 4, get 2 beer free\" deal. There was a lot of swearing going on as well (\"f\" word), which I was surprised at. I'm sure if I talked to a manager, they would have asked the customers to lower their voices or stop swearing. Tennis courts, golf, bikes and spa are available. Yes you pay for parking and self parking is not that far away - perhaps a 1 minute walk - we went during the NorthEast shool spring break and between that and a Rainbow Cleaner conference the hotel was sold out... and we still found parking super close to the hotel - I'd pass on the valet unless you really need it. Rent a car - a guy was trying to decide to go off site for dinner - a 5 min. taxi ride was going to cost him $40 each way!! There is nothing around this Marriott so it's eat in or taxi someplace. Prices are high of course because you're there and they got you. Menu at pool was basic, but good. Nachos ($12) can easily feed 2-3 people as a meal. Kids meals at the pool were great and $10. The Ritz's pool offers free bottles of water and free fresh whole fruit and their lobby has complimentary ice tea or lemonade. JW pool has big coolers and cups and lobby has water w/ lemon/orange rinds. We bought our Universal tickets in lobby - she is a rep. for Universal so you pay the same price as at the gate and it's only a 10 min. car ride to Universal down back streets so you're not on the interstate - NICE! We dined off-site every night - Benihana's, California Pizza Kitchen, PF Chang and Cheesecake Factory. We were here 5 nights and we only left for the day once to go to Universal. The kids loved the pool that much so we didn't do anything else! Ping pong table, tetherball, volleyball and special kids activities were available at the pool.

While I was attending the conference, she was out by the pool and they check you in, give you a wrist band and check it every time you try to go back into the pool, this was great because I felt that she was \"safer\" since anyone from the street cannot come in to the property. The front desk at check in was very friendly and extremely helpful.

We wanted a nice hotel with great pool and surroundings so the kids could just swim, swim, swim. We always do theme parks when in Orlando, but wanted to just relax this time. That is exactly what we did. The grounds were lovely...we all loved the lagoon style pool and lazy river. This JW was definitely a step above a regular Marriott and had lots of activities to offer. Pool servers were efficient and not intrusive. All five of us loved sharing the chicken nachos....there was enough in one order to feed a horse! I went for a run several times around this unique property and thoroughly enjoyed the scenary (after the nachos!). The Ritz is next door and all amenities are shared between the two hotels. Beautiful lake, golf course and even the Marriott Vacation Club next door looks very upscale. You are allowed to use Ritz pool, but not vacation club pool. The rooms are very clean and newly renovated. All staff members we encountered were delightful. We felt like we were away from the Orlando craziness, but in a short drive we could be in the thick of it. There is a huge convention hall between the two properties and they were setting up for a big show while we were there...wonder if things would have been different once all those attendees were there too. Our kids made lots of friends at the pool and we met many nice families This hotel was definitely pricier, we felt, for Orlando. Kids meals at the pool were $10! Restaurants were on the high end too. But no complaints on the service, quality and overall experience. We booked a package that gave us two rooms, breakfast and a few other amenities, and we loved that! We got a vacation that was exactly what we wanted, so worth every penny...would love to go back, but not if doing theme parks.

This place has a quiet elegance and intimacy that sets it apart from other places you might stay in Orlando. The staff was very helpful and always cheerful and pleasant! The room was spacious and very clean and comfortable. We were here for several days back in December, and for that trip, we had a room with a balcony overlooking the golf course. This trip, we had a view of the Vacation Club property and a small lake. The bathrooms are large and attractive with marble countertops and separate soaking tub and shower. The food is very good at all of the restaurants/eateries, though, frankly, poolside was our favorite!!! I especially love that there is a Starbucks cafe inside the hotel!! I was able to get my morning fix without having to go off property!!! In terms of recreation, if you are a golfer, the course looks like it would be great and very scenic! There is kayaking available on property and a kayak tour of Shingle Creek, which runs on the backside of the property. Shingle Creek is the headwaters of the Florida Everglades and a great place to see wildlife. Unfortunately, time did not permit me to do this. I hope that the next time we are here I will get to experience it! The fitness center is very good and well equipped with a friendly and helpful staff! They also have great hours!!! I did not have the opportunity to avail myself of the Spa, but, I did get to poke around in the Spa Store and picked up a CD. There is a Lazy River/pool that is absolutely delightful! The water is very warm, and for a gal who grew up in Miami with \"bathtub warm\" water, I was delighted to be able to get in and not be chilly!! The Lazy River and pools system is extensive, and the zero entry area for the little ones is great!! I think my little grandson would have loved it!! Overall, both stays here were excellent!!! Only had one complaint, and that was the service in the brasserie, \"Citron\". Twice we ate there and waited 10 or 15 minutes after we had been seated to even be acknowledged by a waiter. The food was good, but, the service left something to be desired. The convention facility was great and the organization holding the event was very pleased with their experience!!

I would DEFINITELY return to this hotel. Arrival and Check In: The front desk staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We arrived prior to their regular check in time. Our room was not ready yet so the staff took our cell phone numbers to call us when our room was ready and directed us to the bell hops (are they called that anymore?) to store our luggage until then. Pool and Pool Restaurant/Bar: The pool and lazy river, as you can see from my pictures is beyond words. The hotel could be at capacity and you'd still have room for more people at this pool. You can purchase very reasonably priced tubes and rafts for use in the pool and lazy river. The staff there will give you a marker to write your name on the tubes and rafts so you don't lose them and you can bring them up to your room at the end of the day for the next day (or to bring home, which I did). There are plenty of lounge chairs and towels available. They also had a hair braiding station for kids and a water basketball hoop set up. Obviously it was just my husband and I on this trip but you could certainly entertain a family on the property for a day or two as part of your Orlando experience. My favorite part of the hotel would have to be the pool bar staff. By the end of the day you feel like they are old friends. Our server, Amado, was fantastic. Incredibly kind and attentive. The manager, Geoff, even stopped by to make sure that we were having a good time. The portions of the food and drink were a good value. The Room: Our room was up on the fifteenth floor, overlooking the pool and the golf course. The view was breath taking. It was perfectly sized for two people and clearly had been re-done recently. The style was modern, with natural elements. I am kicking myself that I didn't write down the name of the artist of the painting in the room. It was a beautiful piece. My only complaint would be the shower heads and it was more my husband's complaint then mine, but it was kind of low and required taller folks (like us) to scrunch down. The Spa: I had some downtime on Saturday and popped into the spa to see if they had any availability for a massage and was thrilled to be able to book an appointment later in the day with miracle worker, Esteban. If you go, do yourself a favor and request him. I've been back to work now for a full day (and we all know how that can be, and I'm still feeling stress free).

Management must have taken the night off because Marriott is usually the hallmark of hospitality and trying to be served in three restaurants, I gave up and ordered room service (which was very well managed). The convention in most good eating establishments is to stop near the host or hostess station and wait to be recogniized and cared for. When I tried this in the lobby lounge, the staff ignored me and was miffed when I asked if they served food there. They said to sit anywhere but when I did, at a table next to the bar, they repeated the performance of ignoring me. A waitress stood at a table near me talking with the people there for almost 5 minutes and I gave up and went to the second option. Had she acknowledged that I was there and asked me to wait, I might have, but I was made to feel invisible. The second restaurant had a more attentive hostess station but when I asked to be seated for dinner, I was made to give them my name and wait while they looked up my profile in the computer, then while they printed a charge slip to put in the server's folio. There were less than five tables with diners in this place and the staff was congregated by the kitchen laughing and joking. I gave it another 5 minutes and left. No water, no menu, no service. My last attempt was in the Primo restaurant and when I walked in to the reception area, and was not acknowledged, I left rather than pay a lot for bad service. The service and food served by the room service staff was excellent so maybe that is where management was hiding. Of less aggravation was my arrival to check in. The signage from the self-parking lot is not clear about where reception is located. It's a good hike uphill. The line at the desk was very slow with the tourists but the few business travelers were very quick. There was no manager present and I went back twice to speak with one but the line continued to be slow and I gave up. Lovely property but pack your own lunch or pay the permium for room service. Very dissappointed in Marriott. Was in a Hilton the night before and made to feel like they welcomed my trade.

It is connected to the Ritz Carleton by a conference center, so you have access to the Ritz's golf club, spa and gym. The lobby is nice and expansive - plenty of room for private chats or group discussions. The sushi bar is wonderful and the service at time was overwhelmed due to the number of conventioneers, they were all great. The lobby does get loud, so if you want to slow things down a bit take the walk over to the bar at the Ritz. The room was very nice - fresh colors, lots of room, big closet. We were in a corner room, so that gave us the added space. The water pressure in the shower was fine, but the location of the lights relative to the mirror casts shadows, making shaving (and I imagine putting on makeup a pain. The views were fine as well. There were plenty of onsite dining options both at the JW and the Ritz. I was there for four nights and never felt the need to venture off site. The conference facilities were above average, and there are ample locations for outside receptions or other events. The grounds themselves were also nice and park like. There is a \"lazy\" river, and the pool and poolside bar looked wonderful (though I didn't get a chance to participate). This place is all about golf, and the facilities were top notch as well as the instructors. A great deal is the supervised practice on the driving range. Technically you pay about $45 for 20 minutes of help, but in reality I probably got 45-60 minutes, including tips from the top pro. I made it to the spa as well and had one of the best massages in a long time. There seemed to be a lot of activities available for guests of all ages. Since I was there for a conference I didn't try much, but I definitely plan on coming back with the whole family. I do have two knocks - when I arrived with my laptop, garment bag and golf clubs. I literally ended up rolling everything all the way to the receptionist who, after issuing my room key, casually referred me in the general direction of the two elevator banks without asking if I needed assistance. The second problem was with housekeeping. We ordered breakfast and were told it would be 30-45 minutes and ran downstairs for coffee from the Starbucks while we waited. When we returned 20 minutes later the housekeeper was in the room. We continued to wait another 20-30 minutes and called to see what was taking so long. Turns out the food made it to the room faster than they had anticipated and the housekeeper told the server we were one for the day. My bef is she never mentioned this to us when we returned!

It took a while to find them but they were located in the end (this has happened to me at other large hotels, they always seem to find them!) The Room As you enter the large suite, there is a lobby area with a huge walkin closet that leads into the living area which has its own balcony, pull-out sofabed, desk, flat-screen tv, minibar & safe. Through french doors with curtains you end up in the bedroom, which has another small balcony (no chairs as balcony is too small, balconies at the Ritz next door do all seem to have chairs). Master bedroom has deliciously comfy king bed, an empty bar size fridge, another flatscreen and a comfy chair. The blackout blinds allowed us (and baby) to nap during the day as if it was nightime. The view from the room over the beatiful pools and golf course beyond is very calming. Individual a/c units for BR and LR which is fantastic and they worked great! Service was always prompt, I lost my key and they brought one up within 5min. I called down to ask the room to be made up in a 1h window and it was. I don't think the hotel was full but my husband's conference had 900 delegates and it was not the only one so they place certainly wasn't empty. In room wifi is $15 per day + unlimited domestic long distance, the standard Marriott deal, and it worked VERY well the whole time we were there. The suite also had about 4 phones including a wireless which was very handy. Grounds, pool etc. The hotel inside is beautiful and huge. The lobby has complimentary lemon water, nice & refreshing. There is also a full service starbucks (not one of those inside another store that only has filtered coffee). There is also a bodega with pizza and sandwiches and what looked like chips, snacks, softdrinks. Prices at Starbucks were par for the course, $4 for a tall gingerbread latte (yum!). The grounds are kept immaculate and are quite lush. I saw 3 different herons on a walk by the lake at 10am and a cardinal in the bushes near the pool as well as lizards. There is a play area for kids with slides and a sandbox and a zero-entry pool for them as well. All pools are connected by a 3ft deep lazy river that will propel you around in a circuit if you purchase an inner tube. They also sell beachballs and floaties for kids & have free swim diapers. There is a poolside cafe and seems to be poolside drink service although didn't see any servers but I was only there in the mornings. The pool area is shaded in the AM and gets full sun in the afternoon. Towels are abundant. Location You really need a car if you are here as even the walk from the hotel out of the grounds would be pretty far and there is nothing much nearby. If you have a car, you are a short drive from the Florida Mall and also the Premium Outlets, as well as many fastfood chains. Bring your GPS!

Since we were only staying for a couple of nights, we decided to splurge and stay at the JW. The grounds are Ah-May-Zing. The whole facility is beautiful and service fantastic. The room was gorgeous as expected. Our package included breakfast which was a great deal. The one thing we did not count on was that the hotel is really far away from the Disney parks and is served by Lincoln Town cars instead of regular taxis. We did not rent a car so we spent $42 each way to get to the parks! The lazy river was lots of fun and both kids 10 and 14 really enjoyed it even though the pool was completely jammed with people. There were lots of lounge chairs. You pay for the inflatable rings poolside I think $7 per tube but the entertainment for all 4 of us was totally worth it. There is also a small playground and sand pit area. My kids are a bit too old for this, but we saw lots of smaller children playing there. The grounds are well gated to keep small children from accidentally wandering into the pool area without a parent. Dining. The hotel has the top Zagat rated restaurant in the Orlando area Primo which we were tempted to try, but the prices were a little over the top ($40+ for entrees) and we are used to overpaying for dinner since we live just outside the DC area. We tried a some other Zagat rated restaurants near the hotel but still had to pay $15 each way to get there. If you are going to stay here, definitely rent a car or know you are going to spend a small fortune on Lincoln Town Car transport which by the way was top notch, just a bit pricey. We did dine at the restaurant poolside. The food was delicious. Blackened grouper sandwhiches and angus beef burgers. Delicious sauces and sides. Not your typical tenders and fries. The servers were a mixed bag. The hotel needs to work on their training a bit because the service quality by the pool was inconsisent. There is a very nice Starbucks off the lobby which provided some quiet time for the grown ups. Pleasant aromas, lit candles and lemon infused water in the lobby made the wait for our rental car very pleasant. There were some very nice boutiques in case you needed a nice outfit to wear which is always nice if you run out of clean clothes. We rented a car to head out to our cruise and the Hertz staff on site again were top notch. They fitted us with a very comfortable Camry with navigation at no additional cost even though we asked for a small car just to get ourselves out to Port Canaveral. Finally, we went in August. Plan to get rained on with very little notice.

I would recommend doing that, both to be able to eat elsewhere, as well as do things during the day off-site and return back to the hotel to float until the pool closes. Ultimate relaxation. Parking was expensive (both valet and self-park) and there are no other options if you've got a car. Also, Internet access was also expensive, but we decided to bite the bullet so that we could check in with work, etc. Fortunately, the service was indeed fast and we had no problems with connections all week. Needing to print anything other than boarding passes is also very expensive and you must use their business center. No favors from front desk or concierge were offered to us to print a needed piece of work-related paper. Sadly, don't bother with the eco-tour kayak trip offered through the hotel. Shingle Creek was pretty to paddle, but we saw nothing in the way of wildlife, with the exception of a few common birds, and it was rushed (we had to hurry the kayaks back for another outgoing group) and it was again, very expensive.

Marriott.\" There were so many shortcomings that it negatively impacted our anniversary weekend. The front desk staff was indifferent. When there were small problems (such as double charging me for a single day internet access) the response from the front desk clerk Angelika was \"well, it shows on the computer that you ordered internet service twice,\" then a blank stare, with no offers to research or fix the problem. Only when I pressed the issue, was I then offered a \"comp\" for one evening's $17 parking fee. Honestly, I was offended at her comment as we were not the \"budget\" traveller who used the facilities and left. We ate at the restaurants, payed for a special Luau dinner show, patronized the pool restaurants, and even shopped in the clothing boutiques. I felt like asking her if she believed we were going to try to shirk a $16 internet bill. When upgrading to a lake-side view for the second half of our stay (and rightfully paying the upgrade fee) the room was not ready on 3 seperate visits to the desk. First is was to be ready at noon, then one, then two, then three o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock. Finally, Angelika asked \"was there 'any special' reason you wanted to upgrade?\" Again, an oddly blank stare. I am not a snob, but this was NOT the type of customer service I expect from the luxury line of Marriott. There was no offer to assist us with our luggage during room changes and no apologies for the several mishaps during our stay. Many will find this resort fantastic, but I honestly cannot say that I would stay again. When so many can offer amenities, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service that I turn to.

The lazy river at the hotel was a nice feature and the Bistro Cafe made incredible breakfasts every morning. My 6 year old son woke up each day asking to go to the breakfast buffet! The dining highlight of our trip was Primo Restaurant at the hotel. Again, the staff and chef's couldn't have been nicer. The food was incredible! The restaurant uses organic produce from it's own garden and the flavor really comes though. Each and every dish, appetizer to dessert was a treat to my gastronomic soul. My only disappointment was the pricing of the wine list - while it did offer variety, many of the wines were overpriced. I would highly recommend Primo. You won't be disappointed. The next time I'm in Orlando, I will make it point to dine again at this fabulous restaurant! To sum it up, the JW is a lovely hotel with a professional and truly accommodating staff.

We did Disney and Universal on previous Orlando trips so visited Seaworld and Aquatica this time and enjoyed them both. The women in my family insisted on shopping every evening so we saw Mall at Millenia a lot - ate in the Cheesecake Factory 6 or 7 nights - great food and service. Thought the location was very good - only 15 mins drive from airport, Universal, Mall at Millenia, Florida Mall and Disney.

There are only elevators on one end, so if you need to leave your room to get somewhere on time, be prepared to leave 20-30 minutes early so that you can walk the vast expanse of hallways and rip-off tourist traps. In addition, the elevators have a tendency to get stuck, creak, bang, and once stopped to abruptly that I was thrown to the floor. There is no parking garage, so you have to walk across the hotel, courtyard, conference center, and dozens of parking lots if you wish to leave. If you have a physical limitation, don't count on the bell hops or golf carts to give you a hand with your bags unless you park three feet away from the lobby door.

The JW's pool has a river rapid flow thingy, but I hated this pool - it was 3 foot deep everywhere - far too shallow!!

We knew we wanted an off-park hotel that allowed us to chill out and forget the parks at night. We looked at the Ritz Carlton Orlando and saw that they shared the Grande Lakes property with the JW Marriott. We decided on the Marriott. Why? We knew we would be at the parks more than we would be in the room, and when we were at the hotel we would most likely be at the pool. These properties share access so either pool can be used by guests at either hotel, but the kids were really into the lazy river pool. In the end we just thought it would be easier to run back and forth to the room if necessary. This hotel is about 15-20 minutes away from the Disney parks, and 10-15 from Universal. It is closest to Sea World. We did not have any trouble or traffic driving from the hotels to the parks and we enjoyed having the car with us. Pros: *Our package included breakfast for us and our two children each morning which was nice. *Bell/valet service is EXCELLENT. I have to say they were probably the best valet/bellman I have ever had at any hotel, ever. That is saying something. I would like to particularly recognize Teddy. He hung out with our kids during check in-showed them the special kid's check in area and registration book, showed us around, arranged for a refrigerator to be delivered ASAP, and pointed out all of the sights from our 20th floor room. He was delivering wonderful service, but did so very enthusiastically and with a great smile and enthusiastic attitude. Each time we retrieved our car the valets referred to us by name (this hotel has 1000 rooms), ran to open our doors and offered chilled bottled water. *Service was great. Boarding passes were cheerfully printed, restaurant staff friendly, pool staff available and friendly, etc.. We sent out some laundry when we arrived (about 2:30 in the afternoon) and it was delivered back to our room by the time we returned from the park/dinner. I also had two packages delivered to the hotel. I was notified when they arrived and called down to the front desk. I didn't need to go down--they sent someone up with them. Immediately, not 20 minutes later. Each and every request was cheefully and quickly handled. *Facilities were well kept, spotlessly clean and very updated. Our room looked brand new. We liked the decor in the rooms very much--new and very updated. Great bathrooms. *Enjoyed the lazy river pool very much. Cons: *I don't mind paying for things I need or want to have. I (like most people these days) need internet service. This was truly our biggest issue. It is not complimentary. Fine--we accepted this. We paid the $15.95 charge per day. When I say the service was slow I am not exaggerating. It was slower than the old dial up. I waited over 5 minutes for the Disney website to load. It was extremely frusturating. I ended up using my iPhone instead, but this wasn't great for viewing the Disney Photopass pictures or Disney dining reservations. This happened with multiple websites. If I were there on business and this happened I would have been very upset. In fact, if I were there on business and the interenet were that slow I don't think I could have stayed.

The sushi and pizza in the lobby lounge is very good. The poolside food was very good. I would NOT recommend the downstairs restaurant, however.

The surprising part was this hotel's service team and how hard they worked to provide whatever was requested. It seemed like they'd all recently attended a 'can do' employee motivation workshop or something. I was called in advance of my stay by the concierge to ask if they could arrange anything for me. I arranged a cake to be delivered to my room and a spa appointment. Now, some tips on enjoying the resort! 1. This hotel is connected to a Ritz Carlton. The use of the Ritz gym is complimentary for Ritz AND JW Marriott Grande Lakes guests, so check it out. It opens really early, like at 5 or 6 a.m. The gym is great: spotlessly clean, friendly trainers, fresh fruit, infused waters, towels, headphones, and incredible equipment, many treadmills and other machines with their own TV. Trainers offered what upcoming classes they had that we might like to join. 2. The spa is also great! Wear or take a bathing suit so you can enjoy big hot tubs inside, the steam room, and the sauna. You can use the spa facilities all day when you have a scheduled appointment, I think. I took a book about an hour before my appointment and put on my spa robe, relaxed by a large hot tub, had a cup of tea, etc. before my lovely massage. Afterwards, I used the steam room and sauna and took my time getting dressed. You can shower there, and there's also a private spa pool you can use if you have an appointment. I think 20% gratuity is added to the bill already. The spa was busy when I was there, but my therapist was great and I really felt that I got my money's worth. 3. The hotel property itself is just lovely to explore and walk around. There's a rose garden, the pool complex is great, the lazy river was incredibly beautiful and relaxing, and poolside service was pretty good. We're not golfers but golfing is right across the bridge on a Greg Norman designed course. Plenty of towels for the pool and pool chairs- they charge for rafts, unless you bring your own. I gave mine away when I was done using it. 4. You can eat at any restaurant on the JW Marriott side or the Ritz side and bill it to your room, same with the spa and pools. 5. Internet is an unsecured network and it's like 15.95 a day....other Marriott properties offer free internet on the same iBahn network so this seems a little silly. 6. Parking is also not free, but self park in the lot and walk in any entrance to enter the hotel complex. 7. There is a Starbucks that opens early (6 a.m.,and many hotel Starbucks don't open until 7 and even then sometimes it's hit and miss) between the Marriott and the Ritz, in the connector strip. It is great to have good coffee whenever basically whenever you want, on the premises. 8. There's a safe and a small fridge in the room. The minibar isn't weighted, as some now are, so you can move the stuff inside around and put your own Diet Coke or snacks in there. There's a Whole Foods nearby and we stopped for hummus and pita, milk and cereal. 9. We found the staff very eager to accommodate any request that we had. They went out of their way to do things like offer an umbrella for the day when it rained, deliver my cake earlier than I had originally asked when I decided I wanted it earlier, and anything else we asked them to do. Housekeeping was good and they do offer turndown service in the late afternoon. 10. Finally, this hotel is about 10 mins. from Disney theme parks and less from Universal. We don't have kids so this was very convenient for us, and we felt this hotel was luxurious, quiet, and highly enjoyable. I would definitely return to this hotel to enjoy the pools, the great service, and the amenities.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "jacksonville,fl", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Mini vacation\u201d", "Author": "mamiled", "ReviewID": "UR58085723", "Content": "Traveled here based on the reviews and the fact we weren't going to Disney.

Due to the weather the pool was a little cold by my standards. The lifeguard said it usually is around 83, but due to the below average temps it was running about 78.

We visited for a few days over Valentines Weekend 2009. I am a new member to Trip Advisor so here it is. We live in Florida and visit Orlando area regularly. It was our first time to the JW Marriott Grande Lakes which is on the same property as the Orlando Ritz. I understand the two companies are owned by the same parent company. This JW Marriott is on par with any Ritz Carlton and is probably the most prestigious in the Orlando Area. My favorite is still the Marriott World Center in Orlando but this Resort is better in many ways. There is a cost savings over the attached Ritz Carlton and I thought the property was nicer. The hotel is designed in an old world/ old Florida type style. It located in close proximity to the Orlando area attractions. The two resorts are not attached but are separated by a world class Ritz Spa. Not many of the Ritz Carltons have a separate spa facility but this one does and shares it with the Marriott. The charges can be billed to the room. There are three pools on the property one at the Marriott, one at Ritz, and a adult pool at the spa (reserved for Spa patrons only). The ritz pool is adult themed (but children are welcome) and the spa pool is adult patrons only. The best pool by far is the lazy river themes pool located at the Marriott. There are a few outdoor pool restaurants. There are a lot of seating for hanging out at the pool. We mostly hung out at the Marriot pool (all three were heated in February) as we liked the foliage and shady areas, kind of more like a beach scene. The outdoor restaurants were nice, for pool food (burgers and drinks). I again felt that the Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outdoor grill was geared for this outdoor type food as the Ritz pool restaurant was more higher scale island themed food. The pool at the Ritz had rentable cabanas accompanied with large LCD TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a small drink fridge/ bar. It may even include butler/ waiter service, but I am not sure. The property is beautiful and surrounded by golf courses. The inside restaurants are nice and serve great food (better than what you would expect from a Resort chain). We ate at the restaurant in the lobby of the Ritz and found the food to be a great romantic high end option. Good service and good food. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant but the food looks decent. We did have Morning breakfast buffet at the Marriott and must say its better it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great option and a decent value. All of the food located on the breakfast menu is available in the buffet. I did sneak downstairs to the lobby bar for a drink and some sushi that they prepare right in front of you at the bar. In the Orlando area there are a lot of dinning options but the two resprts provide some decent dining if you are staying in. I do recommend the restaurant at the Ritz. Our room was the basic small room that overlooks the front/ side parking lot. Here was a lot of construction (Feb 2009) I think it was new Marriott timeshare buildings and golf center. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anything special about the room. We did request and get a small fridge in the room. I must repeat the rooms were much cheaper at the Marriott for the same property.

We expected a quiet relaxing stay and explained to the children that this was probably not a lot for them to do at this hotel except for the pool. Boy were we surprised at the amount of activities for young children. Everyday the hotel hosts numerous complimentary (or with a small fee) activities such as Kite making, painting, games. My kids (ages 7 & 9) could not wait to see what was going on each day. The hotel itself boasts a \"lazy river\" which is gorgeous. I was a little taken back with having to purchase the tubes for the lazy river. Kind of gets you with that one. Obviously you are going to buy their tubes with the lazy river sitting right in front of you. (to be completely fair - it was not that much to purchase them) The hotel has an amazing fire pit and they make samores a few times a week. In addition , they have movie night and activities at night. We actually rushed home for a great restaurant .. just so the kids could roast marshmellows. I think the proof lies with the kids --- we were scheduled to do Universal Studios one day and when I told them .. they began protesting stating that \"they just wanted to stay at the hotel \" . ... so we did ! Amazing - kids giving up an amusement park to stay at a resort. I can go on and on .. the hotel is amazing .. the beds are to die for (very spacious with comfortable beds). We did do the brunch one more and as amazing as it was -- it was not worth the amount. I think we paid about $100 for all 4 of us to eat there. Worth it - maybe however if it was less expensive we would have eaten there every morning. Just a bit too pricey for us. They do have a starbucks as well downstairs. The golf course is beautiful but we were unable to find time to play. Next time. We loved the location of the hotel. It was about 10-15 minutes from disney and about 5 from Seaworld however you would never have known it. Very quiet and resort like.

Breakfast buffet is the best I've ever seen. Definately worth the money. Beer beware.. Walgreens, about a quarter mile or so away, sells cases of all sorts of beer alot cheaper than the hotel. The hotel beer went to $5 a beer so we stocked our mini fridge with beer we bought from walgreens. The pool is AMAZING.

My boyfriend and I went to Discovery Cove. The night we checked in, I checked with the hotel that they transported to and from Discovery Cove. They said yes and told me that it leaves at 8:30 or so and returns at 5:20. Since we had to check-in at 8 or so at Discovery Cove she suggested we take a cab or towncar there and then the shuttle back for free. The morning we left, I stopped in again to double check I had the times right and to make sure we could get a shuttle back if we took a towncar over. Once again the man working confirmed this. At 5pm, we went outside to where they said they would pick us up. Since it was pouring raining at that point we expected the shuttle would be a little late so when it was 10 minutes late we didn't think too much about it. 30 minutes late, 45 minutes late, almost an hour later I called the hotel to see if everything was ok. I was then told that no shuttle existed and I was not told this. My boyfriend witnessed them telling me this. The person I was on the phone with argued it wasn;t possible and that if I wanted a ride home I should get the shuttle from SeaWorld to the hotel that left at 5:55. This is at 5:53 and I was at Discovery Cove NOT Seaworld. They then basically said oh well get a cab and I told them I refused to pay for this when they lied. I demanded to talk to the manager. Frustrated beyond belief I hand the phone to my boyfriend to deal with. Toward the end of the conversation the manager agreed that we get a receipt from the cab and the hotel would pay us back. By that time the workers at Discovery Cove noticed we were waiting for an hour and had called a personal driver of their's to take us to the hotel free of charge. Unsure if the hotel would actually stand true to the offer, we accepted the free ride. They were so sweet the driver wouldn't even accept a tip. To sum things up the hotel manager appologized for what happened and said she would \"get to the bottom of this\". Yeah ok...I wouldn;t have cared if they said they didn;t have a shuttle, it's the fact they lied and we sat outside when it was raining for an hour, wasting all that time.

When we wanted to have a nice meal the bar manager suggested we go to Primo he said that even though he worked at the hotel that it was his favorite restaurant (instantly we were skeptical) but he could not have been more right. The atmosphere and staff's wine knowledge were nice touches but the food was amazing. You have to have their signature Pork entree. The only (and this is a small criticism)thing is that it is not located near alot of great night-spots away from the hotel(nightclubs,etc.) We had to take a taxi about 15-20 minutes for those. The little time time we spent in our room was great (we had a great view of the pool---it's huge by the way).

I am an elite member so used Marriott points to stay here. Was also given a choice of free internet, parking, or points for the duration of the stay which as nice. Check in was friendly and quick. Room was decent, not fabulous, but nice. pool view beautiful. Elevators are incredibly speedy! Room was very clean but housekeeping was a bit off. Not as tidy as i am used to with Mariott (and I always tip the housekeepers daily) However, we did decide to extend our stay and splurge on an exectutive suite the last 2 days which was completely FABULOUS and housekeeping was perfect. It was a corner room with a huge king bed and a separate sitting area with a pull out couch which my 11 year old loved. Bathroom MUCH bigger and better. I LOVED that room! I think it was room 12058. We only ate at the pool side restaurant. Service at your pool chair or table service. Great service, great food, good drinks but EXPENSIVE!!! Although I have to say I have come to expect this on vacation. Starbucks in the lobby was so nice to have. The lobby is just beautiful. Marble, fountains, huge, great lobby bar with very nice staff and bartenders. My son loved the sushi there. Again, food was pricey but very good. The hotel is attached to the Ritz via the 2 conference centers. The fitness center is completely awesome. I loved working out there. Great, brand new equptment. lots of it. You can use all the amenities at either hotel. My son loved the Ritz Carlton pool even better than the JW. The provide free rafts too. The JW charges for their tubes. We had brought ours from a previous stay there. Better label your tube or it will \"dissappear\". The pool side service is much friendler and attentive at the JW pool. The lazy river at the JW is spectacular, very relaxing and fun and long too. They do charge for parking which gets expensive. The hotel is not within walking distance to anything else so that may bother some people. They are currently buidling a new Marriott timeshare next store, construction noise was a non issue and it looks like its going to be beautiful.

This hotel is absolutely beautiful and the service was 5 star! I'm a stickler for cleanliness and this hotel was very clean. Every staff member that we encountered greeted us day and night and were willing to assist in any way needed. Our requests were met with speed and accuracy. This is a great hotel situated on 6 lush acres away from the theme park traffic and madness. It's a quick 10 minute drive to Sea Word and 15 minute drive to Universal. To reach Disney it' about a 15 -20 minute drive using the tollway to avoid traffic. We found nearby local restaurants with good and reasonably priced meals (e.g. $10 for a one pound snow crab drinner) within a 7 minute drive of the hotel and with immediate seating. Having read previous reviews regarding the $7 charge for lazy river tubes, we opted to bring our own tubes which were much better than what the hotel offered and our cost was $7 per tube. You really don't need a tube for the lazy river so just enjoy a swim in it. We enjoy water sports so we will definitely get much use out of our tubes. The lush landscaping surrounding the pools gives the feel of an island getaway, definitely not Orlando. I must agree with other reviewers that the daily parking charge is too much given the location of the hotel. Charging guests $15 daily for self-parking on a 6 acre property is truely outrageous! An urban downtown setting is acceptable for such parking charges, but at this location it speaks of utter greed. We had friends traveling with us who opted to stay elsewhere because of the unreasonable parking charges added to the room rates. I can say that being away from the hustle and horrible traffic jams around the theme parks is a great advantage of this hotel. Being from a major metropolitan area we face traffic jams daily and had NO problems with the location of the JW. The hotel was booked to capacity with a convention during our stay, but we never felt that the hotel was crowded and the pool area had plenty of seating and was never overcrowded. Whether at full capacity or not the JW provides the perfect getaway for its guests. We thoroughly enjoyed the JW and will return in the future. Give it a try.

The rooms are still very spacious with great views and large lcd television. But our showers (we had two rooms) had mold in the grout and the drain cap had gunk on top of it and underneath.

The parking was also pricey at $15/day for self park. The food was quite good at the restaurants, but again quite pricey. Worst of all, the service was quite spotty. At Citron the dinner service was nothing short of a disaster the two nights we dined there. While servers tried to be accommodating and helpful, food was late getting to tables and orders often misunderstood. Service at the front desk was also, to say the least, JV. The people who checked you in did not seem to be at all empowered to help guests resolve any problem beyond replacing a room key. For instance, a woman in front of me in line was leaving for the airport and needed to make a quick call home to North Carolina to arrange a ride. No one at the desk was sympathetic or helpful, so I let her use my cell phone. The worst example was on the last day we were there, we could not extend the stay for my parents without paying a much higher rate ($330), even though my mother had been told that she could earlier in the day at the $150 rate we were paying. The manager on duty was unavailable all afternoon to resolve this issue. While he did explain they were fully booked after we waited to see him for five hours, he implied that my mother was not being truthful when she said that she had been told that she could extend at the lower rate. So much for good manners. Also if they were fully booked, why was a room available for $330? Fully booked usually means you're looking for another hotel. So we checked out of the JW and went over to the Ritz at the other end of the property, which charged us $249 for the last night with free buffet breakfast and free valet parking under a reconnect package.

There was hardly any space for our little one to spread her wings. The bathroom however was great, a bathtub and shower and to be honest almost half the size of the room. It was clean and we had nightly turndown service, which was nice. It was wonderful to come back after dinner and have a refreshed room. We also received a free refrigerator to accommodate milk, etc. for our toddler. The Pool: Single handedly made the money we paid for this facility worth every penny! The lazy river was AMAZING. It was great to get on an inner tube and just let the river do the work. Yes, it is slow, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called a lazy river and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the rush?

Just a little variety would have been nice. We also ate dinner at Citron one night and the food was excellent! Specifically the Half Chicken my husband ordered. It was amazing! The pool bar, Quench I believe, also had good food. The drinks were also very yummy but not that strong. For $14, I was expecting a drink with a decent punch, and there was none. The only other place we ate would be the lobby lounge. I ordered sushi there one night and it was TERRIBLE! I have had subpar sushi before, but the rolls I had there were inedible. I was SO disappointed and more so because I paid $35 for 2 rolls! The Service: I was really impressed with the staff. Everyone was really friendly, accommodating.

We had an amazing time! First of all the moment you walk into the lobby you are surrounded by complete luxury! Everything is the very best, the granite flooring, the furniture, and even the wonderful smell! Check in was easy and we were upgraded to a room with a beautiful view on the 16th floor. From our room we could see Sea World, downtown Orlando, the breath taking pools, the golf course, and a great sunset. The room was on the smaller side, but comfortable with beautiful furnishings. The bathroom was large and very luxurious. The complementary bottled water and smores at night for the children is a nice touch. The childrens activities were also great (and free). My boys enjoyed making play dough with the staff while I relaxed. The service from the staff was 5 star through out! The best pool in Orlando The pools were amazing! There is so much beautiful landscaping here that you feel like you are on a tropical island! The lazy river is very long (but slow). You are right next to the Ritz Carlton (they connect through the convention area, 3 minute walk). The JW shares all facilities with the Ritz including pools,spa/fitness and golf. So, you can enjoy both resorts and charge everything to your room The fitness center is wonderful. It has the highest quality equipment with your own personal TV screen on each machine. Complementary fresh fruit is provided and flavored waters. The Food We loved the food here! We ate at Quench (the poolside cafe) twice and it was great! Their Angus Burgers are out of this world. The food is not cheap, but you get what you pay for. The Burgers were very large and high in quality and came with fruit or salad. When we first saw the childrens menu we were surprised to see most items for $9 and $10. But, again the food they brought the children was high in quality. For $10, my son got a Angus Burger that was slighly smaller than mine (yet the standard adult size at most other restaurants), my son's meal also included a beautiful bowl of fruit and a drink. So, the food was worth the money. We also loved the food at Citron. We did not like the sushi in the Lounge restaurant. Golf Golfing here was pricey, but kids play for free and they do give a discount for twilight golf. So it was worth while for us. We really enjoyed the course. We also, enjoyed a morning of just using the practice range. That is a good deal ($20 for the whole day and they will let you borrow top of the line clubs). Overall Overall we loved this resort!!! We are planning a return trip for next year. As a side note our vacation was in two segments, the first 3 days at JW and the next 5 at The Grand Floridian. When we saw the GF and our room we were so disapointed! It was such a step down from the JW. What you get at the GF is a close location to Magic Kingdom for a very high price. But, we won't be going back to Magic Kingdom or The GF (Magic Kingdom is best suited for kids under 5). It is unbelievable that Trip Advisor rates The GF 5 stars and the JW 4 stars. The JW and Ritz Carlton are the real 5 star hotels in Orlando.

Our young teenager was in his glory feeling his independence at this very secure facility. There is poolside wait service & they are always there anticipating your every need. Another nice touch was the lobby Starbucks which quite often came in very handy. Staying at the JW also allowed you to use the facilities of the attached Ritz Carlton.

There were many children's activities offered by both JW & The Ritz, which was very nice; they seemed to cater to families as well as business people; doing both very well.

We wanted a full-service resort since we were travelling with our 2 year old son and weren't that concerned with being so close to the parks since we only planned to go to 2 parks during our week in Florida. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous- I felt like I was in Hawaii when I was laying outside by the pool. The lazy river was a great feature- we didn't rent the inner tubes because our son is only 2 years old and wants to be held in the pool anyway. It's great that you get the JW Marriott's facilities plus the Ritz Carlton's- we checked out both. Both hotels have their own kiddie pools (JW has 2- one a zero entry kiddie pool, the other one a small \"mini\" kiddie pool with a alligator in it the kids can climb on, etc- with only a few inches of water- no risk of them falling and getting in over their heads, etc). When you check in, pick up a brochure which lists the daily (and nightly) activities offered at the hotel- they do s'mores by the campfire every other night, and hot cocoa on the opposite nights- there was a lot of cute things to do if you bring a child who's a little older than our son- they did make your own tote bags, things for St. Patrick's day- you can feed the fish at the Ritz Carlton at 1pm every day in the river that runs behind both hotels- these are really family oriented hotels. Yes, there were conferences going on, but it didn't really interfere with our stay. As far as the room- we had a standard room with 1 king sized bed- room was kind of small considering the retail price of the rooms, but again- we only paid $155 per night. It has a french (step out) balcony, not a true balcony. We got \"city view\"- they said they only had the 2 double bedded rooms left on the \"pool view\" side- but it was fine with us because we didn't spend much time in the room and our son loved seeing the construction going on anyway! They do turn down service every night, which was a nice touch. We didn't eat at the restaurants- just the 2 poolside cafe's; Quench at the JW, and Bleu at the Ritz Carlton. I noticed that the room service prices were ridiculous, so we did not do room service based on that. We were able to request (and quickly receive) a small refridgerator and pack and play for our son to sleep in- we wound up putting him in the small hallway outside the bathroom so we could cattycorner the doors to the bathroom and closet so it was kind of his own \"room\" so we could watch TV after he went to sleep. The pool area at the JW was great- it has 2 hot tubs, PLENTY of lounge chairs in the sun and shade- you don't need to get too crazy \"reserving\" your lounge chairs at the crack of dawn like at other hotels I've stayed at. They had cold water cooler type things outside you could get free cold water (great for filling up sippy cups, etc)- yes the parking charge is ridiculous ($15 a day for self parking, $20 for valet)- we opted for the valet since it was only $5 per day more and plus the self parking was pretty far away to lug a 2 year old (plus a stoller, etc) every day. We found all of the staff very helpful- yes, they are hawking the timeshare/vacation club they are building- but they wound up leaving us a message on our room phone, offering us a return trip of 5 days/4 nights for $400 plus a $100 resort credit (provided you pay for it up front, and attend a 90 minute timeshare spiel)- needless to say we loved this hotel so much that we jumped on it!

Pool lovers in warmer weather will love this place. Dinner: The JW is a big hotel like this only has 2 dining rooms with the main one Italian called Primo.

The Ritz has a gourmet restaurant called Norman`s which was quite nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can charge back to your JW room and earn Marriott Reward points.

Traffic around the \"Bee Line\", International Drive and I-4 is ridiculous, (if you're from D.C., think \"Beltway at rush hour\"; if you're from NYC, think LIE at 5:00 PM on a Friday). If you're driving anywhere, plan on extra time to get where you're going. My family tends to hate eating in hotel restaurants. The restaurants in this hotel are very good, and not bad a bad value. When we vacation, though, we prefer the \"local joints\" - and no chain restaurants. Unfortunately, and it may be due to the hotel's location at the corner of John Young and Central Florida Parkways, (meaning not far from the attractions) you don't get many restaurants at all, and what you do find, tend to be chains. That's nothing to do with the hotel, (and I'm sure they'd prefer their guests eating in the hotel) but if you're into exploring the local area, bring a picnic lunch. Fortunately, there is a bodega inside the hotel (next to the Starbucks) that offers some excellent selections from breakfast and lunch. Beware, however, that it closes by the middle of the afternoon. Overall, this is a very nice property. The lazy river pool complex, long walking path, surreys, and wild life make it as relaxing an area as can be had in central Florida. But, if your idea of vacation is to relax in some peace and quiet, you won't find it here -- on the other hand, the Orlando area probably wouldn't be your first choice anyway.", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place!\u201d", "Author": "steady", "ReviewID": "UR24814072", "Content": "My family of five just stayed here for 3 days over Presidents' Week.

We loved everthing about this hotel. In fact, it is almost like the JW and the Ritz (the sister property) are switched. The JW seemed to have the better facilities as opposed to the Ritz. The lazy river is great, very tropical (yes, the tubes run $7, but you can bring your own). We had room 3057, which was standard room with two double beds, but had the largest balcony at the hotel (on the corner). The Citron restaurant had excellent burgers. The Citron also had a great outside dining area - was surprised to see not many people elected to eat outside - it was ideal. The restaurants do get pricy, so we decided to order pizza the last day. My son got sick and the hotel brought up soda and crackers at 3 AM for free. Everybody was very polite and there to serve. Transportation to Disney/Universal is not great as it is a little further than the other hotels, but that adds to the quality of the hotel. It is in a quiet, seculed location, and on a huge plot of land with Shingle Creek running thru the property. Thus, once you get to the resort, we had no need to leave other than to go to the parks. We did decid to ditch the rental car and take the bus/van service to Disney/Universal. The round trip to Disney is $18 per person per day. It is a small van, so it was actually pretty quick. Universal is free, but this is a big bus and serves 4 or 5 other hotels (the JW was the first to drop off and last to pick up on the day we took the bus, so it worked ok for us. Some of the other riders on the bus commented to me that it took them almost 1 hour to get to Universal from their hotel, so that is definately not the way to go for them).

We booked a king size bed suite with a adjoining room to a room with two queens beds and that is exactly what we got. I have experienced through out the years where your reservation states one thing but when you arrive, you get something else (not always better) We have never had a bad visit at the J.W. From the moment we pulled up, the staff bend over backwards to make you happy. From the Car Valets (yes you can grumble that there is no free parking and the price difference between self parking and valet is about $4 a day but when you stay at hotel in this class you should not expect to receive anything for free even though I agree there should be free parking and free internet ) to the Front Desk Staff to the House Keeping Staff - everybody has a \"how can I help you\" attitude. Check In was a breeze and the hotel splits the elevators between the ground and 12th floor and then from the 12th to 24th floor. I never had to wait for more than one minute for a elevator The J.W. is not a cheap hotel but I feel that the hotel is worth the money (even with the charge for parking or the internet) If you like a hotel where service means something then a stay at this J.W. won't be a bad choice. The suite was large and there was a separate area with a 2nd tv and a pull out couch. The bathroom was big, no bumping into your spouse in there. The J.W. Grande Lakes has a beautiful pool area that has a wonderful lazy man river where you can float along (of course you have to buy the floating tire to float) for hours and even at night the hot tubs were hot. The J.W. shares the grounds with the Ritz Carlton and there is a golf course also (not sure if 9 or 18 holes) My only complaint is that for hotel of this class and price range, why they have to charge for internet when so many other 2 or 3 star hotels don't. If these other hotels don't charge, it just makes the fancy hotels look greedy. I enjoy staying at the J.W. but I don't know if I would recommend the hotel for people who are solely in Orlando to do Disney and Universal. While Universal is not too far from the J.W. , Disney is farther away and pending on traffic tie ups, after along day with tired kids it can seem forever to get back.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pensacola, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel but bring your money as everything seems to be extra.\u201d", "Author": "FloridagirlP-cola", "ReviewID": "UR22669800", "Content": "We stayed at the JW Marriott Orlando Grande Lakes for a regional dance competition.

I am very picky about everything being clean and the entire stay the hotel did a great job.The room was very quiet and the A/C cycles quietly. I expected it to be expensive to eat or shop in the hotel but was surprised at HOW expensive it was. They seemed to add a charge for everything. The grounds were large but they had an additional $15 per day self parking charge. To use the internet in your room was an extra $16.95 per day and to check you email downstairs in the business center was something like 70 cents a minute. Don't try and call for food delivery on the hotel phone or you incur another $16.95 per day. Their beautiful gym and spa also charge an extra fee to walk in the door and just get on the treadmill. I think the thing that put me over the top was after a long stressful day, I decided to go and float the lazy river. Doing that in December seemed so neat. The lazy river winds throughout the back of the hotel pool area and was lushly landscaped. I was stunned to find out you had to BUY a float for $5 or you could walk in the water for free. Sorry, but that was just too much. I feel sorry for the people that have lots of kids. Even the pool isn't going to be free. I think they should have a $5 deposit that is returned went you return the float. My only other complaint is that we went for a dance competition and it started early. We were dealing with a time change. I tried to set the alarm clock in the room but it was the stupidest piece of confusing junk that I have ever tried to program. (I was not alone in this complaint after talking to other parents) I called the wake-up call number and was told no one was \"attending the room\" and directed to call the front desk. I called the front desk and left a wake -up call for 5 am which was never done. If we had overslept the entire visit would have been a waste . I always do two alarms so thank goodness for my daughter's cell phone waking us up. When I complained to the front desk I was given a \"so sorry\" look but not even an apology.

I have stayed at the sister Ritz Carlton property several times and it's well worth 50 bucks more a night. Essentially, the JW is a decent 4 star hotel. If you are expecting five star service spend about 40-50 more per night and switch your reservation over to the Ritz Carlton next door. Because the two properties share amenities I'm comparing to the Ritz. The JW Marriott is very much a high-end convention hotel. Families won't feel totally out of sorts but there are often many business-types here on property. PROS: - The standard rooms at the JW Marriott are decent, clean and well appointed. The bathroom, although very nice, has a combined shower/tub as opposed to separate shower/tub at the Ritz. - Quality of Food was very good. The main restaurant was very good for lunch. - Valet was very responsive (at 20 bucks a night it should be) - Pool was very nice - actually much better and larger than the pool at the Ritz next door. CONS - This is a BIG hotel. You may get (like I did) a room which is a real hike away from the single run of elevators. I had to walk by 22 rooms to get to my door. - Overpriced food servce. Food seemed high even for a 4/5 star otel. - No turndown service. Not sure if they just missed me but I never got turndown (no big deal - but I would have expected it at this level of hotel). - Breakfast menu was very limited. No omlettes which I would have thought were standard fare. So dont' get me wrong, all in all this is a nice place- but although this place could be 5 stars it's really more of a 4 star place. Considering it's Orlando, I woudln't spend over $250 per night here. If you are a family doing Disney I would recommend one of the on-site Disney hotels for the money.

The hotel didn't review security tapes, they didn't question employees, they truly were not interested in figuring out what had happened. The front desk managers were all 24 yr old imbeciles who had no idea what they were doing. They were rude and unhelpful at every turn. We did hear from multiple people who worked there that theft and robbery is a common problem at this location, and that is why the managers and staff have become accustom to acting so rudely. All they want to do is send you to the Marriott Claims department which is a corporate 800 number. And from there they refuse ALL claims. This was truly the WORST vacation I have ever had. The hotel did absolutely nothing for us. Not that this should matter, but some of you will be interested to know that my husband is also a Platinum Marriott Rewards member, and they still couldn't have cared less. I am the type of person that although this was a horrific experience, if the hotel had stepped it up and really amazed me with their wonderful customer service this instead would be a post about \"Yes this bad thing happened, but the AMAZING hotel responded in this truly OUTSTANDING manner!\" Unfortunately, that did not even come close to happening. The management of this hotel should all be fired. They are all worthless and rude. I am truly unaware of what their job role is, as they obviously can't handle basic customer service types of situations.

I was nervous about security and pool chairs given other reviews. We found none of those issues previously reported. There were plenty of chairs poolside. We could find seating everywhere. The pool was pretty empty despite the weather being above 90 degrees everyday! There were plenty of hotel staff available and the poolside service was excellent. Unlike other reviews, we didn't find \"locals\" hanging out at the pool. The pools were lovely and the lazy river was a great! Our room was excellent and housekeeping visited three times a day; morning (newspaper and weather report were a nice touch), afternoon (to tidy the room again and they left chocolates which were a nice touch) and evening (bed turn-down service and again, chocolates were a nice touch). We stayed on the 10th floor facing the pool. It was perfect because Sea World has a fireworks show nightly that we could see from our patio. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in. It was a nice mix of a luxury stay with family activities that will bring us back again soon!

Wonderful room, absolutely spotless. The turndown service was great and the housekeeper always gave us a big pile of chocolates! Maybe it was due to our tip but I know my husband appreciated it. The fragrance in the lobby is very relaxing and immediately put me in a \"vacation\" state of mind, though other guests might find it too strong. The staff were quick, efficient and professional without being too pushy or \"in your face\". The prices at the restaurants are pretty outrageous, but it's a resort so I was prepared. For example, two wrap sandwiches, one margarita and two beers at the pool bar ran $75. It was the best grilled shrimp wrap I've ever had, though! Well worth it. The pina colada was wonderful and I made sure to indulge everyday! Primo was AWESOME. Dinner with a good bottle of wine ran $150 and I didn't regret a cent. My husband and I LOVED the lazy river. The pool shop (where the innertubes can be purchased for $5) was closed when we first arrived, so we just hopped in and swam around. We discovered it was such good exercise to do it this way that we never even bought the floaties! Late in the week, I made a comment to my husband that I kind of felt like floating, but as we only had one day left I wouldn't bother purchasing one. My husband said, \"They aren't free? So this whole time, everyone just thinks we're being cheap?\" We got a good laugh about that. It was a slow week so my husband and I never had any problem getting chairs or service. The only annoyance I had was when a got a cut at the pool and ran up to the front desk to see if they had a band-aid. They were a little too efficient and made a call to security to bring me a band-aid before I could say \"don't worry about it\". Unfortunately, since I had just trotted up from the pool, I didn't have a cent on me and the security person had his hand out for a tip. Awkward moment that I usually avoid by keeping tip money handy, but oh well! We also loved loved loved the fitness center. We work out at a pretty nice club and let me tell you--it doesn't have anything on the Ritz fitness center.

I had a difficult time deciding between the Ritz and the Marriott at Grande Lakes and chose a package at the JW Marriott that included breakfast.

The rooms are small but very nice (we had a king bed with desk, chair, sleeper sofa and that 37\" LG LCD tv), The beds have feather top mattresses and a feather duvet and you melt down in. The bath has a beautiful marble and glass shower and a separate tub. Now, the not-so-great part was that no where did I read this hotel caters primarily to large families with young children. Children were running in the marble lobby, through the elegant lobby bar, in the room hall ways, and in the areas surrounding the pool. Children were crying and whining in the Citron Restaurant. Children were helping themselves using little hands to grab items on the buffet. Children were literally EVERYWHERE. Great if you have children. Not so great for romance.

We strolled over to the Ritz and again, their pool and every lounge chair was FULL at 10:15am. Screaming children were running everywhere. This was July 4th morning. We gave up and went shopping. At 5pm, every lounger was STILL FULL at both pools. This was our experience for 3 DAYS. On our last day, we succumbed and spent $40 to enjoy the pool at the Ritz Carlton Spa, where no one under 16 years old is allowed. It was the best $40 we could have spent and we had a wonderful relaxing afternoon. It was the only positive of our romantic getaway at this property. Let me say also, that the entire property has a problem with unregistered guests flocking to the property's pools. I think many children may be from unregistered guests. When we returned from shopping and were walking to the hotel, two guys in front of us were chatting about how they spend every weekend here at the pool (for free) because there is no security. The guys had a cooler and a pizza box! Yesterday, we watched a large family of 6 unload from a van with pool toys, coolers and floats and go directly through the hotel to the pool. The van had stickers on it and local license plates, so it was not a tourist rental. These were locals who had used the pool before. I went to the front desk and asked what was being done to stop the unregistered guests and they said \"carry your key-card as you will be asked throughout the property to insure only guests are here. We have special security.\" We were not asked once for our room key-card. Last evening as we were sitting in the lobby bar, we watched this SAME FAMILY heading to the parking lot, wearing Marriott pool towels!!! Not only had they spent a FREE DAY at the pool, but they were stealing the JW Marriott towels. And, our entire stay we were unable even once to get an empty lounger at the pool! At check out, I asked the front desk clerk for the name of the General Manager, as I plan to write a detailed letter to him about our most unromantic stay ever. The clerk returned with the name of the pool manager and suggested I bring the problem to her attention. This could have been a great vacation had the JW Marriott / Ritz Carlton had some system to ensure that ONLY registered guests use their facilities. I think they are overwhelmed by the numbers of unregistered guests at their pool and don't see an easy way of preventing it. It is sad because I am generally a fan of both Marriott and Ritz Carlton Hotels and the first to recommend them for a nice vacation.

Marriott for a combination buisness/pleasure stay. The property shares some facilities with the Ritz-Carlton Grande Lakes. Pros: 1. We received a decent rate compared to other 4/5 star hotels in the area. 2. The hotel's architecture and facilities are nice. I would strongly recommend the \"lazy river\" pool for families or for couples. 3. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Cons: 1. I found a cockroach in the shower. It's not that the bathroom was dirty in anyway--in fact, both the bedroom and bathroom appeared to be very clean and smelled fresh. However, finding a roach is unacceptable at a hotel of the J.W.'s caliber--even if it is Florida. 2. The hotel food was average with above average prices. 3. My wife used the spa at the Ritz-Carlton for a massage and the masseuse spent a good deal of time talking about how she had wasn't feeling well and might be sick. That doesn't exactly create a \"relaxing\" environment that you would expect from a Ritz. 4. The in-room guest guide says that hotel offers movies by the pool in the evening. When I called to find out what the movie was going to be, I learned that this activity was no longer offered, but would instead be replaced by \"cookie-decorating\". Recommendations: I wasn't sure whether to give this property 3 or 4 stars, because it really depends what you want from a hotel. f you're a couple looking for a romantic getaway, you'd be better off staying at the Ritz.

The huge grounds of the Grande Lake estate were a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of the Orlando theme parks and it provides you with a real sense of escape. Whilst the majority of hotels seem to sit on International Drive (and therefore closer to Disney World), we felt it looked too crowded and busy (just a row of hotels one after the other, plus the constant traffic on International Drive itself). The JW Marriott by comparison sits conveniently between Disney and Orlando International Airport (about 20mins drive from each) and Seaworld is about 5-10mins up the road. Once you access the hotel entrance from the main road, the hotel itself is set well back on the Grande Lakes estate, with no noise disruption from traffic. We found the hotel to be very convenient, but realistically you will need a car to get to/from the various attractions. This isn't a problem, but if you only want to spend time at Disney World and don't want to drive, then you may want to stay on International Drive (but you won't have the tranquility of the JW Marriott). We reserved a deluxe room but were upgraded to a lake-view room that overlooks the lake, golf course and lazy-river pool area (definitely recommended). The photos on the hotel website really do not do any justice to the lazy-river - it is possibly one of the best pool areas I've come across in a chain hotel. The hotel is exceptionally well maintained both inside and out, rooms are of a good size (all four of us managed comfortably in one room) and bathrooms especially are larger than your average hotel (including a separate bath and shower). The JW is adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton and guests of both are able to use the Ritz's spa facilities. Despite the size of the hotel and its conference facilities, this hotel is great for families. There is an arts & crafts table in the Citron restaurant at breakfast time, inflatables for hire/purchase for use in the pool, volley ball court, table football and tennis court. You can also high 4-wheel 'bikes' (more like pedal cars), to cycle around the path adjacent to the lake. If you are considering booking - check Expedia. We found that although Marriott claim to offer the lowest publicly available prices on their website - we were able to book an Expedia 'escape package' at a 40% discount to the lowest rate on Marriott.com (including breakfast for the the 4 of us). Restaurant prices are typically higher than you would expect to pay outside the hotel (c.$20 for a burger / club sandwich), but the food is very good and worth trying. If you are on vacation and visiting the various parks though - you'll probably find Disney prices to be not that far off, plus you'll likely have to content with long wait times for a table in the restaurants. Consequently, you'll probably find dining at the hotel a much more relaxing experience if nothing else ! The hotel states on its website it charges $10 per day for parking, but we didn't have any parking charges on our bill and the card-swipe machine for the car-park showed a rate of $1 per night - therefore probably worth checking before you travel. Overall the hotel is excellent. Beautiful grounds, a grand building, great location, plenty of parking and very friendly staff. Definitely recommended for families wanting a good quality hotel, couples, and business travellers (given its proximity to the airport and the size of the conference facilities).", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cAnother Great Trip to the JW\u201d", "Author": "Rum2Drink", "ReviewID": "UR16449841", "Content": "My family and I just returned from our 5th stay at the Jw Marriott.

The rooms are typical hotel rooms so it can get tight for a family of four if you only book one room.

The shuttle over in the morning only runs twice and there is only one return around 6 pm, so if you have little ones and stay here you would still need a rental car.

We've never had this experience before, so my husband called the central reservations number for Marriott and it was confirmed that normally all you need is a valid military ID, but to call the hotel directly since each hotel is individually owned. My husband called and was first told that it's a state law in Florida that you can only get military rates with orders. This is something we've never heard of since we're Florida residents. My husband did receive an e-mail from someone at Marriott showing their policy regarding military reservations, but it said nothing about it being a Florida law. After talking to the hotel manager, we were told to go ahead and reserve a room and we'd be given the military rate. Today my husband gets a call from the hotel manager saying that we are allowed to stay this one time only and that's it. The manager said she called other hotels to see what their policy was on military rates and the only thing she told my husband was what we already knew.. you have to show your ID card at check in.

Although the hotel has some very nice features like the golf course, the gym and the pool area I agree with the reviews who say that it's not anything special. The hotel doesn't offer a big choice of restaurants or shops. Also the hotel has some issues with cleanliness. Even though they do your bed nicely for the night with some chocolate, the housekeeping really should improve their elaborateness. The tooth brush holder was stained with dried toothpaste from guests before, which makes you wonder about the all in all cleanliness of the room. On the first morning we ordered breakfast to our room and headed then out for shopping. When we came back they had cleaned the tooth brush holder (after we complained at the front desk) and the bed was also done, but they did not clean the milk stains from our breakfast on the table. So this was very strange and we did not feel comfortable afterwards. There was also quite some dust on the lamps, what should not be the case for a 4-5 star hotel. What we also didn't like is that the hotel has a lot of additional fees. For example parking was $14/night and wireless internet was $16/from noon to noon and movies were at least $14 each or even $20. Most of the normal TV channels are not available, which makes you order movies automatically. So your stay at this hotel may get quite expensive if you add all these things up. I know other 5 star hotels whose prices are more reasonable.

It is adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton and surrounded by lakes, as well as, a Greg Norman signature golf course. Both hotels are beautiful and provide a large variety of amenities that can be utilized by guests from both hotels. Service, courtesy and respect are top priorities at this resort! Utilize hotel provided vacation planner services prior to your stay. One call is all you need to make reservations on or off property. The standard rooms are nicely appointed and have a large bathroom with separate shower and bath tub. All restaurants have excellent dining experiences. The entree selections are superb. Room Service provides a nice selection of entrees from each of the restaurants within both hotels. Wonderful family outing on golf course. Yes, children are able to play after 1-2pm with complimentary greens fees and equipment rental. The pools are beautiful. There are pool bars surrounding the area with pool side food and drink service provided. Sand court volleyball and bocce courts are near the pool area. Ritz Kids is available to guests staying at Ritz-Carlton and J.W. Marriott. Many activities and events are included with camp costs. There is a gameroom for older children with video games and two pool tables. If you are staying New Year's Eve request a room with a lakeside view. You will see fireworks from Disney, Universal, and Sea World, all while watching the hotel's own fireworks. Ask for breakfast package included with room rate. Buffet at Citron is $21 for adults. It is well worth the cost, but can add up over the course of your stay. I have read several reviews that complained about transporation from the Grande Lakes properties. A complimentary shuttle is provided to Sea World and Universal. There are scheduled departure times from the hotels in the morning and scheduled return times in the evening. Town Car Service is available at the front of each hotel. Flat Rate Fees as of 1/3/08 are as follows: $25 one way to Universal and Mall at Millenia, $15 one way to Sea World or Discovery Cove. This makes your trip completely hassle free, no traffic (drivers are aware of traffic congestion and take an alternate route), no parking fees, no long walks to your rental car after a long day.

We live nearby in Tampa and wanted to get away for a few nights for New Year's Eve and celebrate our anniversary (we met at Christmas 2 yrs ago). My boyfriend secretly called ahead the morning of our arrival and told them it was our anniversary. We were able to check-in at 1pm which was great as I could see that several people were checking in that day. The bellman even told us that we were lucky our room was ready as about 250 guests were checking out and 250 guests were checking in that day. When we entered our room there was a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a note saying Happy Anniversary. I thought it was a very nice touch! I thought the resort was gorgeous! We had a king bed room with a balcony overlooking the pool, lakes and golf course. It was great, as the hotel had fireworks at midnight on New Year's Eve and we were able to watch them from our balcony. You could also see 3 or 4 other fireworks displays going on in other parts of Orlando at the same time! They also had a party going on in the lobby for New Year's Eve with a DJ and a band. We danced down there until about 11pm, then headed up to our room and ordered room service and watched the fireworks display. We walked next door to the Ritz Carlton to compare the hotels. To be honest, I'm not sure that the Ritz is worth the extra money in this case, as the JW Marriott is that nice! I have stayed at other Ritz Carltons in the past (but not the one in Orlando). Probably the major difference is the bathroom is a bit smaller at the JW Marriott compared to other Ritz properties I've stayed at. There is no separate room for the toilet and a single sink instead of double sink. The bathroom was still VERY nice, with a separate tub and shower and granite counter top. I guess the furnishings are a bit more traditional and country club like at the Ritz compared to the JW Marriott. However, you are able to use the Ritz facilities and still charge to your room. We ate at the Vineyard Grill at the Ritz for dinner one night and it was excellent! My favorite part of the JW Marriott was the Lazy River. As others have said it is SLOW, but is still a nice, relaxing pool. It's heated, so not too cold for a Floridian in December :) I've stayed at Atlantis in the Bahamas and it's similar to their lazy river, but a bit slower. There was a man playing guitar and singing by the pool which was nice. The pool was definitely not too crowded (maybe everyone was at the theme parks?) and we easily found chairs to lounge on. As stated in other reviews, you have to buy the tubes for the lazy river for $5/each. We at at Quench by the pool and had DELICIOUS cheeseburgers. Although I did not use the fitness center I did take a look. It's located at the spa between the Ritz and JW Marriott and is free for guests of either hotel. It looked to be very nice with TVs at each treadmill. There is also a jogging path outside by the lakes where you can also rent the surrey bikes. Valet parking is $20/day, which is a bit high and food prices are on the high side, but can be expected at a resort. They have in-room movies for about $15, but include movies that are still in the theaters. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return if I found a decent rate.

It is, as others have stated, a palatial property with the best pool I have ever seen at a Marriott, including the Camelback Inn, Eden Roc, and Ko Olina/Ihilani HI. It features a snaking lazy river, the first I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever known where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not required to use a float tube (float tube rentals $5/week\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut you can find them poolside easily or buy a $1.99 tube at Target as staff allows you to bring your own); the JWM allows you to body surf and swim the entire lazy river without a tube; you can stand up 3-4 feet deep and swim wherever you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153river\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd connects at least five separate grotto-like pools, including one gradual depth pool for tykes. There are plenty of blue cushioned lounge chairs, the best of which face the lake, but they are all gone by 11AM by towel throwers that may or may not ever show up again. The water is all heated and the landscaping is lush with coconut trees and fruit palms. Two hot tubs are small for a pool this size. Few lifeguards during daytime, and none at evening, but the lighted pool open until 9PM is steamy fun after dark with underwater LEDs and backlit trees. Agree with prior reviewers about the pool being unkempt by evening, with soiled towels and lip-sticked drink cups everywhere. And if some kid gets sucked into the vacuum drain like those hapless stories on Dateline NBC, there will be no hero lifeguards. I saw none past 5PM. So, like your neighborhood swimming hole, pick up your own towel and swim at your own risk. But it is a pool with plenty of rocky hidden nooks and crannies for hours of fun (but sadly, no slide). Love that the wait drones unobtrusively walk around the pool but do not bother \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Drink? Drink?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they would, for example, on a Carnival cruise. My biggest knock to the pool: even though this is a non-smoking property, management allows smoking at all the pools. I was lounging poolside with a fresh beer, just getting to the good part in J.D. Salinger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s A Perfect Day for Bananafish\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou know, when Seymour Glass pops his own noggin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhen I am overtaken by the stench of a White Owl blunt. Some endomorphic, cardiac-bypass candidate was chomping a lit stogie behind us. I asked him to put it out, and he informed me that smoking is allowed; a quick trip to the manager confirmed that the putrid, belching smokers in Bill Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world are welcome to puff it up at the family pools at the JWM. The pool manager offered to move us\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot the smoker! Sorry to see it as there were Virginia Slims puffing Magdas\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe haggardly 95 lb ladies with cow leather skin and a voice like Jack Palance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat several areas around the pool surrounded by dozens of gasping parents and children. Regrettably, I deduct a point for this antiquated smoking policy, plus the generally unguarded and unclean pool area. The pool itself, though, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153killer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Beyond the comments of the other respected reviewers on tripadvisor, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to give you some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true tips\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to this recommended 2003-built luxury behemoth hotel. (1)Location: JWM is 9 miles from Disney and Universal, 4 miles from Sea World and Gatorland; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a straight drive to each of those locations. It is 8 miles from the airport and is conveniently only four miles off I-4. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Central FL Parkway, which, along with Orange Blossom Trail running perpendicular to it, has every single conceivable restaurant and shopping venue (and I mean every one\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat least a couple hundred; if you name one not on this strip, I will eat my hat). You name the chain, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s here, all less than five miles from this hotel. The key is that you remember not only to drive up and down Central Florida Parkway (the street the JWM is on), but also Orange Blossom Parkway (one main street over), which has dozens more eateries; ask the helpful concierge. You will find the driving easy for directions, but traffic, as it is in all of Orlando, is treacherous due to car volume and lost tourists cutting lanes like Richard Petty at the Daytona 500. Check with your car insurance carrier before your trip to see if you are covered for accidents on your personal insurance without paying the freakishly high auto rental surcharge. But, fear not eating and shopping if you stay at JWM. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand I mean all\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly five minutes down the street. Please also note that the Premium Outlet Shops, including high end retailers (so, no great bargains, frankly) are about 15 minute drive from the hotel. (2)Hotel food: didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even eat it except burgers at the pool restaurant Quench; too costly ($75 for four burgers and fries, Cokes and a single beer), and too many tasty options just down the street. Beer tip, though: Buy the domestic beer (e.g. Budweiser) once in a giant 23 ounce plastic souvenir cup for $10 at Quench by the pool, and then every 23 ounce beer refill in that plastic cup during your entire stay is only $5. See menu or bartender for details. Not bad. (3)Season: we are here Xmas to New Years and although most things open including eating places even on Xmas, the volume of traffic and people would suggest coming some other time of the year if you can. Busy as a one-legged man in a butt kicking contest around here on the holidays. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re told that Jan-Feb and Sept-October are the slower, more desirable months. (4)Kissimmee/St Cloud: advertised on TV as a cheaper alternative to Orlando, it is 11 miles from the JWM, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolute hole. Vagrants, cheap hotels, littered streets, homies playing dominos on porches, pawn shops and pit bulls are some of the sights in Kissimmee. Skip it. (5)Amusement Parks: Go early and beat the crowds. Run to the very back of the park and work your way to the front, and do your rides counterclockwise. Everyone else will start at the front and work counterclockwise, too; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavioral science and as a sociology professor myself, this advice works to help you stay ahead of the crowd. Always, also, get in the leftmost line as it is less frequented. By the way, I thought Gatorland would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old school\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Florida kitschy fun. It was, instead, a boring money pit with lifeless, fenced alligators. Avoid. (6)The Ritz-Carlton: The only other property at Grande Lakes with JWM, it is a much smaller appearing hotel and tiny warm pool, but I did not go inside. I think it not worth the price (double the JWM) based on what I see, as the JWM is very posh. It is, however, more secluded and boutique-like. The Ritz pool is one large tiled traditional pool and is quite bland. (7)Room: we had a standard lake view room, which is 425 sq feet, and the rooms not facing the lake overlook the expansive greenery of the front of the hotel, well off the main road on this 500 acre estate. I value an interesting view, and after staying here, I think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be fine with a regular, cheaper \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd view, and perhaps get a free upgrade to the lake view if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lucky. All views look good as I studied them from the side windows. If you have to watch your kids in the pool, then ask for a low floor pool view. Our room had two full beds, but with growing boys, we asked for a rollaway bed. It was a nice sturdy framed bed with real single mattress that was made up by the chambermaid daily; not like the rollaways of Boy Scout days. Recommended. The bathroom is granite, small but elegant, and clean. All doors are heavy and solid, and the room is very quiet. I, a lifelong insomniac, sat in the bathtub at 4AM while the family slept\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou know, wondering if I have a special purpose in life or if I am simply a waste of oxygen-carrying red corpuscles\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhen I noticed the framed over sink mirror, the wall art, the heavy-glass shower with chromed silver fixtures and the gentle recessed lighting; a premier 11\u00e2\u20ac\u2122x9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bathroom, indeed. Makes me feel good, even if the tub is hard on my rump after sitting for two hours in it. The bedroom is cheery yellow with crown molding, a desk, and floor to ceiling windows covered with plush, room-darkening shades. Suites were all full when we were at JWM so we did not reserve or even see one. The AAA rate saved $25 daily, so I signed up on-line for AAA for $50 annually a few days prior to this trip and got the JWM AAA preferred rate and got back the membership fee in the first two nights alone. And yes, they did require us to show the active AAA membership number when we checked in. AAA card saves you at every amusement park also. Plus, if I cop a flat tire, some lackie will show up three hours later roadside to fix it. The American Automobile Association ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just for Grandpa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anymore, I guess. Most JWM Grande Lake rooms have balconies, about 25% do not have balconies; ask for a balcony. We were on 11th floor out of 26 floors total; it was still high enough and quiet. In-room electronic safe and clothes iron standard; no hair dryer, although they do have one of those wall-mounted magnifying mirrors where you can spot every hairy mole on your face quite easily. Sink in bathroom only. Locked fridge with $5 Fiji water and $3 KitKat bars. Marriott super sleeper beds are quilty comfy (but do they ever wash the duvet?). (8)Laundry: 3rd floor, $2 wash, $2 dry, $1 Tide, only 3 washers and 3 dryers for 1000 rooms; you do the math. Oddly, no dollar bill change machines. (9)Television: Not LCD, not HDTV, but with pay in-room movies. Unlike at some Marriott hotels, TVs accept RCA cables for your video games, video cameras and PlugNPlays. (10)Parking: self parking daily charge of $10 automatically to your card, typical Marriott nickel and dime job, and is about 1/8 mile from hotel entrance. But you can drop off Grandma and your bags at front entrance first, then park. Key card access to parking grounds. Valet available, but they park in same lot as self-parkers. Plenty of empty spaces, easy. You need a rental car. Taxi from Int\u00e2\u20ac\u2122l Airport is $50 each way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Feel the burn, baby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A Chevy Equinox with 18k miles from a national rental agency for the 7-day week including all taxes and fees with the AAA discount (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m liking this AAA thing) was $407, cars only $320 from Orlando Airport. Most major auto rentals (Hertz, National, Alamo, et cetera) have cars right at the Orlando airport, not some off site shuttle location. Check on this when you rent as it is very convenient to do the paperwork at the luggage carousel and simply walk across the street to the parking garage and get in your vehicle. (11)Lobby: impressive, immaculate, marbled and rich, and a great meeting spot. Next door is the conference center. Halls are long, but security cameras every 20 feet. Concierge helpful, esp. for directions, and separate theme park attendant that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll sell you tickets (remember to show AAA card). The JWM is connected via indoor hallways to the Ritz-Carlton, too. (12)Golf: right outside the door and across a walking bridge (no need to drive), the course looks fairly flat with plenty of water (i.e. lost balls) and few trees. There was a mention of $179 greens fee\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcould this be? Driving range on-site with $5 bucket of balls, too. (13)Activities: free tetherball a la Napoleon Dynamite, huge lawn chess and checkers set (makes you appreciate sitting at a table to play), nice running paved trail along lake but only 1.5 mile total, hula hoops, foosball, bocce ball, all free. Best is free sand volleyball court; suggest buying your own ball at Target store on Orange Blossom for the week. Fun, free. Three lighted tennis courts, unknown fee but seem free. Rental beach bikes, but no place much to ride them. Saw no one access the swampy lake, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty at night and no known crocs. Lame basketball net by the tennis court with flat balls and cannot play if anyone playing tennis. (14)Service: housekeeping exceptional, even lined up our shoes and toiletries. Turn-down and chocolates at night. Really nice attendants, always a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hello, Mister and Missus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We tipped $5 daily and they seemed to appreciate it with extra clean services, but did a fabulous job anyhow. We did not use room service food, but the Marriott \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fine print\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on menu states that they add 21% surcharge plus a flat $3 to each order making it cost prohibitive. Beware. (15)Internet: Can be ordered in your room for a large fee, or through the teensy Business Center on the first floor using JWM computers. How much? An Aussie guest left his bill next to the computer: 47 minutes internet, $26.75. Guess my email can wait. (16)Sundries: Starbucks on ground floor 6AM-6PM daily, and a sundry shop (think aspirin, magazines and such) next to a couple high end stores selling baubles for the glitterati set. Walgreens \u00c2\u00bc mile down the street for the rest of us. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re told that this hotel caters to mostly business travelers because of the conference centers at the Ritz-Carlton next door and here at JWM, but I assure you that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every bit elegant for families, is convenient to everything without being on the honky tonk roads, and is a Hawaii-like oasis of green on 500 acres in Orlando. It does not feel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153businessy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at all like, for instance, a Marriott Courtyard. Highly recommended, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay here again, and would recommend it to my own extended family.

They really won me over when an early breakfast was not added to my bill the morning of checkout, but instead of making me late for my plane, they comped the meal with great apologies for the delay. I thought that was pretty good service, and it was done without a manager involved which showed me that they really empowered the staff to satisfy the customer.

(If Sea World is the EXCLUSIVE focus of your Orlando trip then stay at the Rennaissance. You come out of the hotel and walk in to the Sea World parking lot. Click on my name above and you can read my review of that hotel.) If you read previous reviews you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a very good sense about this hotel. Virtually all of the positive reviews are accurate, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dwell on the negative reviews because they are often single-issue, guest-specific complaints. It's a gorgeous property that really is two properties because the Ritz Carlton is next door so the overall size of the place is huge. Which brings me to an earlier review on here called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Pros and Cons of Self Contained Resorts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And the writer makes a number of great points. You will definitely need a car to get to this place. There is nothing immediately nearby except for a drugstore which is quite a walk. If you are willing to drive 3 \u00c2\u00bd miles you will find a large number of malls offering a variety of dining. It's self-contained for better or worse and that means they have you by the... As others have stated the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLazy River\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was a tad lazy. But hey, they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t promising an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Energetic River.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It really is the high point of the resort and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got kids, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be spending more time than you bargained floating in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lazy River\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd making an early day at Disney virtually impossible. Definitely book the breakfast rate through Marriott. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a few dollars more and worth the additional expense. Speaking of which it IS an expensive place to stay but in line with other extensive resorts: they charge you a lot for parking, they charge you a lot for internet access and they charge you a lot to eat. In short there are no bargains at this place but again the price I paid was definitely worth it (although make sure that you and your family will be spending enough at the hotel to really enjoy all of the amenities It will not be a value proposition if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re basically using the hotel as a place to stay.) Overall the grounds are exquisite and the hotel itself is in great shape. . My wife took a lot of great pictures and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give you a very good sense of what this property is all about Signage could use some improvement. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what I mean when you try to find the entrance to the hotel from either of the highways. Sure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big building in the middle of a lush green area that says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the side but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to keep your eyes peeled to find it. And when you check in you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what looks like a check-in counter but there is no identifying signage to confirm that is where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re supposed to go. Finally this hotel represents the perfect reason to either buy or short Marriott stock: It was a huge beautiful property that seemed more empty than full. If you believe Marriott is a company that is going somewhere then you can say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning for the future with plenty of room for growth. And if you believe Marriott has too many rooms and not enough people to fill them then this property will bolster that argument! Enjoy your Disney/Orlando vacation.

Normally not such a big deal, but with an 8 month infant in the room, it became one. We booked this hotel for its pool and lazy river.

After the 2nd time, we left fairly disgusted and went over to the Ritz Carlton pool, which was much less crowded and MUCH cleaner. As far as service is concerend the JW Marriott's service was not so great. There were a couple of days in which house keeping did not make up our room. On one occasion we called down asking for more tissues. I asked how long, because we were getting ready to put the baby to sleep and a knock at the door would have woken her. We were told 20 mins. One hour later still no tissues. After calling several times, I had to tell them to leave the tissues by our door. The same thing occured when we called asking for more towels (since we have no clean towels due to the room not being cleaned).

I hope you don't get bored here, because there is nothing else near this resort. Zip. Zilch.

I didn't have a car (took a shuttle from the airport) so my dinner choices were the 3 restaurants on-site ($11 side salad, anyone?) or walking the mile to the Walgreens up the road for triscuits and cokes. Also, as is common at these sorts of resorts, the offerings for vegetarians left much to be desired. Taxes and \"communications package\" (Internet and phone) added 23% to my room rate. Save your money and don't bother with the Internet access in-room: it was amazingly flaky, and not in a delicious pie-crust sort of way. The front desk staff, while obsequious, wasn't very knowledgeable about the resort and its amenities. For example, I got 4 different answers from 4 different staffers about the availability of lap swimming (the 5th answer, a blank stare, didn't make it into this count). I found the quickest way to get a splitting headache in Florida was to go outside into the afternoon heat and humidity, then come back inside into the amazingly over-air-conditioned resort.

Primo was our favorite. * Athletic facility was good, plenty of cardio, weights, waters/towels. * Beautiful landscaping, flowers, palm trees, etc. * Comfortable beds, in room safe, hair dryer, iron, nice bath products, bath robes, & spacious bathrooms. * Short car ride to Sea World (5 min or less); 15 min to Magic Kingdom. Cons: * Raining when we arrived; 2-3 foot radius of wet carpet near sliding glass doors in room. * TV did not work for 3 days; would not power on and was not resolved by front desk. * Shower curtain brackets very loose and in need of repair. One good wobble, and it would have come down.

Both times were for business purposes and our hotel choice was predetermined by our meeting schedule. The first time, although our stay was pleasant, our experience was marred by poor valet parking procedures. Upon check-in, they\" temporarily\" parked our car and misplaced it for several hours. Later, at check-out, with the car in full view of the valet desk, they lost our keys. After much frustration, the keys were found right where they were supposed to be-at the valet desk! This time, we dropped our luggage off, and parked the car ourselves. For check-in, we were told we could park ahead near the curb, and then relocate to the parking area. Once again, I was \"ordered\" to surrender my keys for \"safety\". I explained our past valet history and was told \"you have 5 minutes to move that car\". Slow check-in prompted repeat visits and warnings from the valet. Our rooms had been booked 6 months in advance, with specific requests-none of which were acknowledged. Our room, was not what we requested, and was not cleaned as well. A trip back to the front desk resulted in a satisfactory change. Our new room was clean, well maintained, and the bed extremely comfortable. The A/C,however, never seemed to keep the room cool. Internet access,while quick, was expensive at $12.95 per day. All public areas are beautiful and well maintained. Other than the rude valet, all service personel were helpful and friendly. A note about the food-all of the food served at the property, including our convention lunches, were extremely tasty and well prepared. In fact, on our last visit, our opening cocktail reception was one of the best functions of it's type ever attended. It is very hard to write negative things about such a beautiful property.

And both experiences were absolutely top notch. The JW Marriott Grand Lakes and Ritz Carlton Grand Lakes share the same fabulous property with an absolutely fabulous spa complex w/ adult pool between the two that both guests have access too (w/ spa appt booking). The hotel itself is gorgeous, restaurants are fabulous...never had a bad meal. The \"lazy river\" heated pool outside the JW was wonderful. I was here with my boyfriend and we're both in our early 40's and even WE couldn't resist spending the entire day renting tubes and meandering around that pool. The pool area was so huge, it was easy to find a secluded area away from other guests if you chose. The King room we reserved was a corner room and it was gigantic, very comfortable bed. Bedding was gorgeous, room was gorgeous, flat screen tv's . The bathroom was also gigantic......wonderful bath products. The staff was very accommodating and very sweet....I asked our maid if she would mind leaving additional bath products since there were 2 of us sharing them, and every day I would find 4 shampoos, conditioners, lotions, soaps....4 of each thing left for us...along with extra big, fluffy towels. She was a sweetheart.... We scheduled massages at the Ritz Carlton spa and they were fabulous. It was wonderful to retreat to the adult pool at the spa after our massages, if you are looking to get away from the children/families at the Lazy River pool. And the spa itself was top notch, expensive, but top notch so be prepared. I had scheduled a nail appt in the salon for a pink/white fill while I was there....very expensive and not up to par with my usual manicurist, (my manicurist was of course appalled....\"they charged you how much?? For this??? lol!! ) loved the pedicure though. One thing I didn't care for was the big push after your massage to sell you the products that were used in your massage. Don't comment to your masseuse that you like anything....because you will find a bag full of everything you mentioned at the front desk ready to ring up with your massage (they certainly aren't giving it to you for free...) I thought it might be a fluke the first time, (maybe I DID tell her I was interested? Didn't recall saying anything) and sure enough...on the 2nd stay, same thing. another bag waiting for me at checkout...... Be sure and ASK how much that bag costs before you squeel with excitement and say \"Yes!\"......do your credit card a favor and politely refuse. All in all though, that wouldn't keep me from coming back to either hotel...this is one of the nicest hotel complex's in Orlando by far....it's a wonderful break from the tourist trap areas and Disney/Universal hoopla.

We went as a family this past week to attend a friend's wedding at the attached Ritz Carlton. Since we took our 2 boys (9 and 12 years) my husband and I decided that it was silly to spend the extra money on a gorgeous room at the Ritz since we would be rooming with the kids. We decided to be practical and stay at the JW, not realizing that a JW Marriot was very different than your everyday Marriot. We assumed it would be a less luxorious a hotel---WRONG!!! The JW was magnificent! The hotel is as beautiful as the Ritz. The rooms were spacious, spotless and truly luxorious. The bed was so amazing; feathertop mattresses with light and airy duvets---I even loved the pillows! I slept better there than I have anywhere in a long time! The service throughout the hotel really blew us away; a lovely woman, Franciox (sp?) checked us in and then proceeded to walk us around the lobby to show us where everything was from the concierge to the different dining options. and the service did not stop there. Every staff member we encountered was nicer and more helpful than the next. While waiting for the Universal shuttle in the front of the hotel, two different staff members asked us if we needed anything, offering us ice water (with lemon, of course) while we waited. They made us feel like royalty. Our kids even commented how nice everyone was. The property is amazing; the grounds are lush with tropical gardens and plantings and the pool is terrific--- I even played in their \"lazy river!\" This part of their pool (the deepest is 5 feet) is great for kids and adults, the water is warm and is landscaped beautifully with waterfalls and boulders and there is a light current that gently glides you around. Really terrific! Okay...the food: We ate at Quenches, pool side bar/restaurant, and their casual food is delicious. Their mojitos were good also. The restaurant Citron was excellent. We had dinner there one night and had breakfast there as well every day. Their buffet breakfast is top notch, fresh and classy. Our boys thought they were in heaven with the thick french toast and big waffles which they topped with marshmellows, sprinkles and God knows what else! My family and the staff surprised me Saturday morning with a birthday candle in my yogurt/fruit served in a parfait glass and then this lovely young woman, Bernadette, popped open a bottleof champagne and poured my husband and I complimentary mimosas! We enjoyed talking to Bernadette and hearing about the JW Marriot and her experiences with the company. She is terrific!

You can order from the kids menu/appietizers, like quesadillas, gourment pizza, for around 7-10 bucks a plate and includes drinks. Nice treat and impresses the heck out of the kids.

What a great hotel and resort this is! The main reason for visiting Orlando was our daughter had chosen it to be the venue for her wedding(which was held at Cypress Grove).Even though we are still young,in our 40's to late 40's the theme parks were of no interest to us,having done them all 5 years previous,so staying at a resort hotel was ideal.The JW Marriott was perfect for us. We arrived quite late and very tired.The bell staff were very polite and courteous,which impressed us straight away.The lobby wasnt very busy and we didnt have to queue to check in.we were greeted with smiles and check was very smooth.we were also given a 10% discount card to use in the resturants(excluding alcohol).our room was exactely as we had wanted,8th floor with views of the pool,golf course,the ritz-carlton and surrounding area. We had 2 queen size beds in the room,as requested,desk ,large tv,usually sort of stuff for this star hotel,still plenty of space to move around in.the bathroom was large by american standards with a tub,vanity top,toilet and a great walk in shower cubicle.There was plenty of towels and hot water whenever we wanted a shower.The room was very clean and the maid service was very good also,leaving a bottle of water every day and a couple of chocolates when they had finished the turn down service in the evening.There was only a small balcony which you could stand in,not big enough for chairs.We never used the air con that much,prefering to leave it off,but when we did it was easy to use and adjust. The actually hotel itself is very impressive and very big.the public areas are very clean and do have nice carpets and fixtures.Being linked to the Ritz-Carlton,it was nice to walk along the wide corridors through the conference centre between the the 2 hotels. There is a good choice of restaurants and a few small shops.We used the gift shop for water,sweets etc.Starbucks for coffee's and cakes on numerous occasions.Breakfast was in the Citron restaurant.Buffet style or A La Carte.We ate buffet breakfasts mainly which were fantastic,as much as you wanted for about $40 for 2(after discount),never needed lunch that often after the breakfasts we had,sometimes never needed dinner either!Citron did get very busy between 10 and 11,but the wait was only about 10 minutes.We only ate in Citron in the evening a couple of times,and then it was only burgers and club sandwiches,which were about $15-$20. We had a lovely meal in Primo,the Jw's Italian restaurant.Very good service and very good food.It was $201 excluding tip for 3 courses,2 bottles of water ,3 glasses of wine between us and a single malt whisky(and that was $18,ouch!).very good value though i think(apart from the whisky). The lobby lounge bar is very nice.It does get very busy in the evening and very noisy.Service can be very slow between 9-11pm.It also has a sushi bar and food can ordered from the citron as well.The alcohol is very expensive in the lounge bar,$6 for a bottle of beer or half a pint of draft beer,$11 for a glass of wine,$13 for a cocktail.You did get free cashew nuts and spicey peas though! We ate in Quench(the poolside restaurant) once and had a burger and a wrap,a beer and a coke for $30 which was very good,big portions as well. The Vineyard Grill at the Ritz-Carlton was very good.They specialise in steaks and they were very good indeed.We had our daughters wedding meal there.The staff were great and the food excellent.Just as a guide starters $12-$16,mains$36-$52 and deserts at about $15. The gym at the ritz-carlton was free for hotel guests and very well equipped.Our daughter used the hair salon for her bridal practice and up do,plus french manicure.she was very impressed with the service they provided. We never used the pool so couldnt comment,but it did look very good. I did use the golf course though,and it was wonderful!A truly great designed course and very challenging.You could choose which ever tee you wanted to play,the practice facilitys were excellant and the staff were very helpful.I was the only golfer in my party,but never played alone which was very good.The rates changed while we were staying there,but at the moment it is $95 before 2pm and $65 after 2pm,it was $195 a round when we arrived.

We like the room to be quite cool while we sleep, and the easy to use thermostat was able to be easily set, however, we think it was in error. Even though the thermostat would indicate that the temperature was in the low sixties, we were warm at night. We estimate that it was off probably five degrees. We could have complained about this, but in staying at the hotel four days we learned to compensate for innacurate settings. Perhaps if we were to say anything else negative about this hotel, it would be that there is nothing nearby. We flew in for a meeting, but if there is any option, a guest should have an automobile. You must have access to a car or take a cab. There is no way one can walk to nearby businesses. Although you can walk to the adjacent Ritz Carlton down a very long corridor the facilities are about the same. Although our meeting brochure indicated that the hotel was near the airport, I would argue that point with the author. It was a forty or forty five dollar drive to the airport without a tip. The hotel is pricey, but quite frankly, we didn't feel that we were ripped off as we have felt in a number of other pricey hotels.

My wife and I have stayed at the Ritz at the same location before, but recent reviews in Trip Advisor were negative, while all of the reviews for the Marriott were glowing. We however cannot give such a review. Our negative experience was partially beyond the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control. Our first night we returned from a late dinner to the sound of a screaming baby in the next room\u00e2\u20ac\u201dreally screaming, ear infection or colic screaming. We heard no adult voices and called the manager who said that security would check it out. This was off and on till about 11:30 pm: screaming baby, called manager, slight pause in screaming and then resumption. Finally we fell asleep to be awakened by the baby at 5:30 am, called manager, who said security would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look into it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Crying stopped and restarted in time to for us to get up at 6:45 am. On our way out to go to WDW, I spoke to the manager on duty, who assured me they would handle things. We returned, exhausted from visiting the mouse, at 5pm to the sound of the crying baby next door. Gerald, the manager told me that they had been unsuccessful in reaching the people in that room and they had not returned any calls. (Hopefully, a baby was not being left alone.) He told me I would have to move, and when asked, I was told that there would be neither adjustments nor a room upgrade. I asked that they have the other people move. No. So, as the Indianapolis Colts were just ready for kickoff against the Ravens, I had to pack up our suitcases and move to the promised non-smoking room. So, we went from the 9th floor to the 12th floor and switched elevators, rode up to the to the 17th floor where we were led into a room that reeked of cigarette smoke. After another room was found, down we went to 12, switched elevators and to our new smoke free, quiet room on the 11th floor. My wife, who is blind and travels with a guide dog, had to readjust to a second hotel room in as many days, that was the opposite configuration of the first.

The Marriott is co-located with the Ritz, meaning you get the benefits of both hotels (for example, you can charge to your room from activities in either hotel). However, if you're planning on staying here, it's important to know what this place is and is not so you won't be disappointed. It is a beautiful, self-contained large property with great amenities (spa, golf, multiple pools and restaurants) that caters primarily to large conventions but does fine with individual travelers. It is NOT a Disney property or particularly close to the Disney parks and offers no shuttle service. No Mickey presence anywhere. You'll need a car to go anywhere off property (nothing in walking distance) although SeaWorld is very close. As for the resort itself, the ROOMs are well appointed but a bit short on floor space, especially with double beds. Could be crowded with more than 2 people. Beds are very comfortable and the bathrobes are much better than average. I don't believe the Marriott (unlike the Ritz next door) offers a Club level. I had a lake view, which is gorgeous. The balconies, however, are too small for chairs and therefore largely unusable. Bathroom is large and modern with separate shower. Amenities are liberally replenished. They also give you a free botter of water daily and replenish it at night. Wired internet (which includes free domestic long-distance) is $13/day. FOOD at the pool was a bit disappointing in quality. Overall, I preferred the restaurants in the Ritz, especially Norman's. Prices are about what you'd expect for a resort of this type. The lazy river POOL is great - water was the perfect temperature. Note that you must pay $5 for a tube (or bring your own). The pool is large enough and there seemed to be enough deck chairs that it didn't feel crowded even when the convention folks were there. Towels were always available and you could take as many as you needed. I don't golf, so can't comment on the course. I realize that SPA experiences are somewhat subjective but I found this to be the single best I've ever had. Some spas try so hard to make you feel relaxed that you end up feeling stressed -- this was just plain relaxing. And, I was able to get the time I wanted with less than 24 hours notice even with a convention in both hotels. I found SERVICE to be uniformly excellent. There were hotel staff specifically assigned to the convention but plenty of staff for those not part of the large group. Many times, staff members went out of their way to be helpful or just plain pleasant. As noted, the resort is somewhat isolated and you will need a car to go anywhere. That said, you could easily spend at least 4 days here and not be bored. However, if you want to go off-site, you can purchase Disney (and other) tickets through the concierge. Overall, if you're looking for a place in Orlando to relax and unwind -- adults or families -- the Marriott is great. If you come here for a convention, you won't be disappointed.

My son had a whale of a time playing in and around the pool and the childrens club staff were great for organising smores evenings and poolside games. We visited 6 of the various parks whilst there and felt the days spent at the JW were a relaxing break between them all. So much so, sometimes it was difficult to drag ourselves away!! We ate in the Citron, Primo and Quench Pool Bar at the JW and the Vineyard Grill and lobby bar at the Ritz Carlton. Primo and the Grill were quite expensive, especially with wine but that's what you expect with a hotel of this calibre. All were of a very high standard of food and service with an excellent and very cheap children's menu in Citron and Vineyard Grill. Our particular favourite though, has to be the sushi bar in the lobby of the JW. Very reasonably priced and excellent sushi. The gym at the Ritz is one of the best equipped I have seen in any hotel, with towels, headsets to the personal moniitors and complimentary bottles of water. I used it quite frequently during my stay and it was always clean cool and well staffed. Lastly the staff in particular were a credit to the hotel. They really were polite, accomodating and a pleasure to meet. Ricardo the lobby barman is worth a mention for his excellent cocktails. Our turn down service was prompt with extra chocolates being left for my son!!! We did do the Marriott Vacations Club presentation organised through Bobbi. It was very professional and we didn't feel under any particular pressure to sign up. We didn't , but would certainly consider it in future if the JW is an example of other Marriott properties. The only one negative point I have is the $9 per day parking charge. (which we were charged) Excessive I thought for a 2 week stay - $140.00 (including tax). Would stay at the JW again in a minute, and in fact would find it difficult to stay anywhere else whilst in Orlando.", "Date": "July 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLazy River was awesome!\u201d", "Author": "asiribunrit", "ReviewID": "UR5495126", "Content": "My boyfriend and I booked the hotel and airfare on Jetblue for 5 nights at $1200.

I must say that our first night was a zinger as my husband had a medical emergency at 3:00 am Saturday. I called the front desk and the overnight desk manager, Michael, quickly arranged for transportation. We did not need an ambulance, however, I was very impressed by their offer to personally drive us to Sand Lakes Hospital in a company car if other transport was not quick enough. Fortunately, a town car came quickly and escorted us to the emergency room. A call to the front desk later that morning was all I had to do to get someone to pick us up and, to my surprise, the desk clerk had asked is all was OK with my husband. Putting that first event behind us, we found the hotel to be first class all the way. Yes, there are major conventions going on but this place is so big everyone blends in. We really enjoyed Citron for meals. Generous portions and reasonable prices. Quench by the pool also offered some great dining choices. Be aware that most drinks from the pool bar at about $10-$12. Soft drinks were about $3 and beers ranged from $3.50 and up. The Starbucks in the lobby is great for morning coffee and danish. The best part of this resort is the lazy river and the grounds. There is plenty of room for guests to lounge by the pool and a walk of the grounds are a must. It is ajoined to the Ritz Carlton and the spa pool and the Ritz pool are beautiful.

So much so that we came just for the pool! We didn't go to any theme parks but enjoyed the pool and the other amenities that the hotel offered. The $9 a day self park was no problem for us and we usually got a fairly close parking spot. The one time cost of $5 for a beach tire tube to float in the pool wasn't an issue either since the hotel never did charge us for the tubes (4 in total) or the parking. Yeah! You do need to have a car so you can go outside of the hotel to get a different choice of food and give yourselves a break from the same wonderful surroundings. Since International Drive is so close by, any and all food types are available. A Walgreen's pharmacy is fairly close by at the corner as is a number of shops just south of the hotel if you are in need of things from a grocery store called Publix. Since we're from Canada, we like to pick up a few things that we can't get back home. We were fortunate enough to get a balcony with a pool view which enabled us to view the fireworks from various parks that go off around 10 in the evening during July. The room was large enough for two adults and two boy's 12 and 10. The bathrooms are quite large with lots of towels. The hotel gives lots of pillows but we did bring some of our clothes already on hangers since hotels are a bit stingy on offering hangers even after you've requested more. The special radio which can play CD's (bring some from home) also has sound effects such as a babbling brook, crickets chirping, waves on a shoreline, a tropical rainforrest and sounds of wind blowing. It was wonderful have these sounds playing all night while you sleep. The service was always friendly and ready to accomodate you with whatever you required of them. We never did call back or go down to get our \"free\" gift from the people who are trying to sell time shares. The will call you the next morning after you arrive and the day before you leave if you don't contact them which we never did. They never even spoke to us when we passed by so I guess we were lucky or the others who've commented on them being push just didn't have the luck that we had with them. We ate by the pool most of the time and the food and drinks were fantastic! We ate at Citron's for lunch and dinner once each and both times the food was extremely good and the service wonderful. It was great having a Starbuck's coffee shop in the lobby area and the kids enjoyed getting their hotchocolates their or the strawberries and cream drinks which they're now addicted too! Overall this is a very nice hotel with lots of marble in the foyer area making it very grand looking but not cold. The offering of cold water with citrus pieces floating in it for a wee bit of flavour was a nice touch at the front desk. It was my birthday and our 15th anniversary the week we went and they do ask you at the front desk if you're celebrating anything. I don't know why they ask this since nothing was done about both the things we were celebrating. Why ask if you're not going to do anything about it? I thought that funny is all.

There is a massive interconnected pool system that is connected by a \"lazy river\" meandering through lush landscape and waterfalls. There are many secluded lounging areas with pool chairs and hot tubs. It could be super crowded but you can find your own hideaway if you need one. The Hotel itself is awash in marble and wood, very elegant, and feels ritzy. The rooms are upscale Marriott, nicely furnished with great open door balconies. The bathrooms are huge and well appointed. If there was a downside it was the service, something that really sets the Ritz apart. The JW is a huge resort with lots of employees that sometimes seem to be on their own time, in thier own world.

With a 5 star rating and average cost of $330+ per night, my standards are pretty high. And, with the outstanding selection in Orlando, I expect a lot of bang for my buck. Let me begin with the basics: We were there for a conference (as are the majority of their guest), it was a holiday weekend (i.e. crowded), I am not the type of reviewer that complains about every little thing I can find - if I mention it, it's something that actually changed the quality of my trip. I travel frequently and stay at either 4 or 5 star resorts. I am Marriott Rewards Elite member and therefor could expect that they were as accomodating towards me as they would towards anyone staying there. We were there for 5 days. Here was our experience: Check-in was difficult simply b/c they were full and couldn't honor any of our request (crib or adjoining rooms). We ended up with 3 rooms on 3 different floors. 1 room was serviced by one elevator, the other 2 by another which made for the regular back and forth trips to become pretty annoying after the first few days. In addition, the elevators are not centered in the building and the walk to your room can be extremely lengthy. We enjoyed the pool and many of their daily activities (make sure to do the poolside dive-in movie). The restaurants are good, but don't offer enough variety for a longer stay. Room service was good as well. Sea World is very close (less than 2 miles), but getting to Disney properties was a true pain w/ traffic, driving and parking. The lake views are breathtaking, but the parking lot views are not 5 star. Everything was expensive (as is expected at this level of resort). No park transportation of any kind is provided. The hotel is perfect for a conference and it's attendees, but would never be my choice for an Orland stay that involved kids wanting to go to theme parks, Downtown Disney, etc. To sum it up: You will love: The landscaping, the pool (perfect!), the poolside entertainment, the spacious sized rooms, the activities, incredibly fast elevator service, and the friendly staff. You will hate: It's distance from Orland attractions, the fact they nickle and dime you for everything (poolside drinks are $11 each, $17 parking, and having to purchase a float for the lazy river, etc.), the walk from the elevator to your room (confirm a room with a low number to prevent this significant annoyance), the fact that everyone in our group of 3 rooms couldn't get their room cool enough and the lack of dining options on a longer stay. If you have a conference at this hotel, congratulations - it will be a great experience. If you are looking for a family vacation at a nice Orlando resort, I would suggest one of the choices better geared towards that crowd (Hyatt Grand Cypress remains one of my favorites and is cheaper than the JW Marriott).

We were quoted a military rate of $145 which we got since my boyfriend is in the Army and proudly served in Iraq for 14 months. However when we got to the desk to check in they told us they were unable to honor that rate because unknown to us his military ID card had expired 3 days before we checked in. We never realized this until we got to the hotel. So we asked if they could honor that rate if we could fax something from his company commander the next morning. One of the front desk clerks told us yes that shouldn't be a problem. We took down his name and said we would do that the next morning. However we were unable to get ahold of his commander because it was a sunday so we wouldn't be able to fax anything until monday morning, the day we were leaving. I was then informed by the front desk that the person who told us that we could have something faxed on letterhead to honor the rate was misinformed and we would have to pay the regular rack rate of $289. I asked if there was anything we can do to get the military rate honored and was told no. I later called down again and spoke with the front desk manager who said they can give us the $239 corporate rate and take care of our parking for our stay. I told him I thought they should honor the military rate since that was what we were quoted and we obviously weren't aware that my boyfriend's ID had recently expired. He rambled on about how the company has to make a certain rate for all rooms and seemed very unbending to accomodate the military rate so we were stuck paying almost $250 for the room. The only plus side to the room was it had an amazing view on the 9th floor overlooking everything(pools, the Ritz, theme park, etc) with one of the concrete larger balconies compared to the other guests metal ones. The room is also oddly designed in how you don't see the bed when you walk in like most, it is down this narrow passageway after the bathroom, and it is not a large room. We were dissapointed in not being able to get the military rate but we happened to catch a fireworks show right from our balcony before going out one night, so it was romantic and offered some solace for our misery lol. Other than that I wasn't very impressed with this marriott. I think the front desk staff thinks the hotel is better than it really is and acts pompous and arrogant. A lot of hotels have nice public areas and nice lobbies, but they skimp on the room size and quality. That is what I thought of this Marriott.

We were able to check in early, but was given an inferior room as a result, which considering that we were staying for 6 nights, was not worth the early check-in. The hotel is basically a nice property, but lacks the service relative to the prices it charges. Wired Internet access is $10 per day in the room and/or an additional $10 per day for WiFi, which didn't seem to work in the pool areas and isn't available in your room. I had a wireless broadband laptop card overnighted to me by my cellular dealer to avoid the $20 a day gouging and to be able to work by the pool. My package was delivered at the hotel the next morning and took 4 hours to get to the front desk despite my repeated requests to pick it up. When I finally got the call that they had it and went to the front desk, I had to wait 25 minutes for them to find it. Good thing I didn't need my package for a meeting. The pool areas could be nice but suffer from lack of attention. Pool chaises were kind of downmarket, material-wise, and had mildew on most of them. The pool has a lazy river which is nice, but unfortunately the foliage that surrounds it falls into the pool and the staff doesn't do a very good job of skimming the dead leaves out of the pool. There did not seem to be any poolside service for drinks or food, so you had to go to the restaurant near the pool to get anything and the food served there was not very good. The pool attendants and lifeguards were too busy talking to each other on the bridges that went over the lazy river to provide any service. Food quality was just OK. We walked to the adjoining Ritz Carlton (you can charge to your JW room) for many meals as the food was better there than the JW. When we would leave the Ritz after breakfast and walk by the Ritz pool there would be a bunch of employees primping and cleaning the pool area, there wasn't similar activity at the JW pool. The spa/fitness center is managed by the Ritz and is typical of other Ritz properties. The Marriott Vacation Club (timeshare) reps, that appear to be Concierges when you first arrive, pester you with a \"free gift\" everytime you walk by and also leave messages on your room phone. This was really annoying and I just started saying \"NO\" when we walked by before the rep could start her spiel.

The pools are great since there are three of them: the lazy river at JW, the spa pool, and the Ritz Pool. These are within 2-3 minutes from each other and not 10 minutes like said by others. All of them are beautiful and the ones I like are the spa (privacy) and lazy river (JW) for ultimate fun at a pool. What I like is the mega-luxury look of the JW Marriott. You have to see it to believe it. I decided to just give up a few pictures to just let you see for yourself. As for the room, they are some of the best in town. If you need space, go get yourself a 3-bedroom villa! Nicely decorated. Gold course and the restaurant at the Golf course is excellent.

Other hotels should hold JW Marriott Orlando up as an example of what a fine hotel can be. From the moment we walked in the door we were treated to first class customer service and acommadations.This hotel must stress the importance of customer service , the employees were very happy here and it shows with a first rate attitude. The rooms were very spacious, large marble type bathrooms. Robes in the closet to use while staying in the hotel. Mini bar, safe, flat screen TV, cd/clock radio. The hotel staff cleans your room in the afternoon and again for turn down service around 6 pm.The lazy river pools is wonderful and enjoyed by young and old. The inner tubes used to float down the lazy river is not free and is not rented which seemed a bit strange to me, you must buy them at 5.00 each and yours to keep. They let you use a marker to put your name on it if you want to leave it at the pool at night. The pool and the two Jacuzzis close at 11.pm I thought that was a bit early but oh well.... The hotel restaurants are ok,,, some better then others, the buffet breakfast although expensive at 22.00 a person is worth the splurge at least once, the pool restaurant has great food, for a quick snack by the pool. Had two burgers and two soft drinks in the hotel cafe, the bill was 50.00!! This resort is not cheap folks that are just the way it is, to stay here you must accept this. I did however find a very good restaurant named Kahana just 5 minutes from the hotel with very reasonable prices and a wonderful menu of tropical type food, they also have a very good band playing on the weekends. The hotel has self parking at 7.00 a day plus tax and a bit of a walk to the lobby. They do offer valet but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more expensive. The hotel is close to Universal and Disney if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your thing, about 20 minutes to either park. Im sure kids will love to stay here with the massive pool they have on the property, plus other game rooms that are set up around the hotel.

Our stay at the JW Marriott was fantastic! We were right in the middle of Spring Break so it was very crowded but the staff at the Marriott handled everything quite well.

Thank goodness for the beautiful Grande Lakes area as it redeemed our negative opinions of Orlando with the exception of Disney resort/park area. In fact, the resort was so pretty it made leaving for the parks difficult. The lazy river pool is so much fun. The only negative to the pool area is that it is a bit crowded and saving chairs early is necessary especially during the time we were there. The breakfast buffet at Citron is really good; we included it in our rate when we booked. Be advised, it isn't inexpensive. We thought it was well worth the cost. Also, our best meal while visiting Orlando was at Primo. The halibut with crab risotto was out of this world. Everything was so fresh; check out the chef's garden on the grounds outside of the restaurant. The rooms are a little on the small side but not uncomfortable. Request a room with a view of the pool area as you also get a great view of the golf course; it's not as quiet but the view is worth it. Also, if you stay here during a busy time, I recommend the valet parking. You pay for parking either way and the self parking lot was crowded and kind of a long walk every night when we returned from dinner or parks.

The lazy river is a spectacular change from the routine hotel pool. Not only is it fully heated, it is lavishly landscaped and truly beautiful. My only disappointments were that it was rather difficult as a parent to keep an eye on or follow your child through the maze of water and that only once was someone available to give me a towel from the \"hut\" located in the pool area. Every other time either no one was working or there were no towels available. As for the breakfast buffet...it is something to behold! Everything imaginable is available from fresh fruit to quiche to oatmeal and everything in between. There are also two chefs on staff who cook up made-to-order omelettes and Belgian waffles. Happily this buffet was included with my room since the bill for two adults and two children came to $99.00! As for the room, it was classically decorated. The beds were comfortable with down bedding and many down pillows, however, for the price, I expected the room to be larger. The marble floored bathroom included a glass shower with separate tub, but it was probably half the size of the entire room. We did request a refrigerator and a small dorm-size one was brought in but the only area it could be placed was at the end of one of the beds, which made it stick out quite a bit and very awkward to get around.

The grounds the whole resort is set in was beautiful and you could easily get lost and just simply be mesmerized by the gardens Spanish architecture and sheer beauty and grandeur of the hotel. There are times when you really feel like you are in a Spanish castle set in paradise ( I recommend on teh first day of your rip to just wander around and get lost in the resort to just explore whats what and where everything is).

We went to Quench which has superbly large portions of food (great caeser salad), Primo which has divine food in very classic surroundings, and Citron which has fabulous breakfast buffets and THE best lunch buffets in the world (didn't have time to go to the dinner) , with incredibly affordable prices (being a Londoner where everything cost at least triple, it was an excellent bonus).

There were a few people who really helped us out, and one lady was Sherry, she was very sweet. Also at the concierge there was a lady whos' name I have forgotten, but worked on the left most desk. Not only was she genuinely funny, but she also gave definitive, unparalled advice on what to do and where to go and answered all our questions as best as possible, so if you got any questions go to her! I really do struggle to pick a fault with the hotel, the only problem I encountered was that the beauty of the hotel and its abundance of attractions and facilities distracted me from actually visiting alot of Orlando's attractions lol. There is so much to do here that you could spend your whole vacation without leaving your resort and still having the vacation of a lifetime. All in all a truly fabulous hotel.", "Date": "January 3, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "JW Marriott Orlando Grande Lakes", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d270561-Reviews-JW_Marriott_Orlando_Grande_Lakes-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$176 - $449*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4040 Central Florida Parkway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32837</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "270561", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/95/f8/95f809d79995c576f517e038f82dcf459large.jpg"}}
