Not surprised to see the extraordinary number of \u201cexcellent\u201d reviews, as we agree completely. Can\u2019t imagine a more gracious and accommodating staff. They even winked conspiratorially at my daughter as she joined us for the breakfast: it was too good; she couldn\u2019t resist. After \u201cperfect,\u201d what can anyone say about the location? I suppose you could sleep right there in the Piazza San Pietro (if they\u2019d let you) but failing that it would be hard to get closer to the Vatican. No vehicles allowed on Borgo Pio is a wonderful bonus. Everything you need is just steps away: fruit and produce shop, bakery, deli, wine store, pharmacy, excellent gelato (careful though, or they\u2019ll overcharge), and delightful dining all right on the block or one up or down. The Vatican Museum is 8-10 minute walk; St. Peter\u2019s is five. Buses three short blocks away will take you anywhere else you might want to visit, although we walked everywhere: trips to the Pantheon, the Coliseum, the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps--to name a few--gave us the chance to see Rome as the Romans do. Well okay, they aren\u2019t doing as much gawking. After three days this was my neighborhood.

It's a little further to the other sights of the city (ancient Rome, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps... but walkable-- especially to Campo d'Fiori, Piazza Navona, Pantheon). It's on a street where no car traffic is allowed. Despite this, the street is VERY busy with tourists during the day. However, after about 6 PM everything quiets down & the tourists move on. At night, it is very quiet & great for sleeping. We had 2 rooms-- a triple & a double used as a single. The triple was huge! It had plenty of room for me, my wife & young child. And, the double was spacious as well. The rooms & bathrooms were clean & the bed was comfortable. The bathrooms looked as if they had recently been completely updated, but the bedroom part was a bit older but still looked good. The showers were a little unique. The triple had a tile half wall for entry (no door-- the water sprinkles out on to the floor a bit) & the double had a curtain you draw around you on all sides. They worked well. They had flat screen TVs with satellite & a lot of stations-- none were English-speaking channels. Air conditioning worked just fine-- in fact, it got a little cool at night! Internet is available in the lobby for free (didn't have a laptop, so I don't know about the quality or cost of WIFI-- I think it's free). Breakfast was very good-- they provided it in a nice room in the basement floor. Meats, cheeses, breads, juices, coffee, hot chocolate, fruit, yogurt, scrambled eggs, etc. were available daily. The woman (sorry, forgot her name) who works at the front desk was fabulous. She was very helpful with our questions & requests prior to our arrival & was very nice when we were there. Good service by everyone we dealt with at the front desk. It's always a crapshoot when picking a hotel in a foreign city... again, this is as close to a sure thing as you're going to get in Rome. Clean, comfortable, convenient (esp. to the Vatican) hotel at a reasonable price. Restaurants near the hotel are just okay-- tailored to tourists (okay food at slightly higher prices).

Our rooms (46/48 and 20/21 for the return) were clean, roomy, beautifully decorated. They had a mini refrigerator as well as a safe. The breakfast buffet was perfect. We have stayed at many Bed and Breakfast's and this rivaled the best of them even though they are not advertised as one. The location was great. Borgo Pio is a wonderful little street. There are plenty of restaurants on the street although I would recommend the restaurants to the left of the hotel as you walk out as they were less commercialized. In addition to being 2 blocks from the Vatican and St. Peter's Basilica, we were able to walk to many things from the Hotel with no issues. Castle Saint Angelo, the Bridge of Angels, The Spanish Step and the Piazza Navona which had many restaurants as well as shops and of course other attractions. For other attractions, we used the bus system or took a taxi which the staff quickly arranged for us. Speaking of the staff, they were wonderful. Elisabetta, Andrea, Mario were so nice and helpful. They treated us like family. The other staff members that we interacted with were also extremely nice. The breakfast buffet staff were also very friendly and actually seemed to get excited if we asked for a Cappuccino. Again, the breakfast was excellent.

Also, there are plenty of temptations nearby (less than 2 blocks away as you step out of the hotel) to enjoy the dolce vita; gelatto, pastries, pasta and vino! The only drawback was the elevator.

Their ample breakfast got us off and running each morning of our 5 day stay. If you are looking to stay near St. Peter's then this is the place to stay. It was a short 5 minute walk from the hotel lobby to St. Peter's. Though we were near St. Peter's getting around Rome wasn't a huge problem with the Metro a 10 minute walk away. There are pleny of shops to pass by and look at while walking to the Metro. One particular place we would stop at was the Castroni for an excellent cappuccino a block or two from the Metro. The locals were constantly in and out and it had all kinds of goodies to think about bringing back home. Mario and his staff were always willing to help and give suggestions. When I return to Rome I'll stay here again even though it isn't in the heart of Rome.", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland", "Title": "\u201cOur Wedding in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Mary Terese", "ReviewID": "UR8377885", "Content": "My husband and I were married in St. Peter's on May 11, 2007.

The location is really interesting though because it's so close to the Vatican. There's lots of clergy walking around and we felt really safe. Our room was beyond clean each day too and was very comfortable. The breakfast downstairs each morning was a perfect way to start the day. There's plenty of options and it's very American (cereal, egg, etc). It definitely held us over until a late lunch. The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommending restaurants and directions. Also, some luggage in our party was lost by the airline, and the hotel was more than helpful with calling the airline and retrieving the luggage for us. We would definitely stay here again.
