It is not, as other reviewers have pointed out, the most glamorous or luxurious or cutting-edge hotel in the wonderful city of Madrid, but it is clean, well-maintained, quiet (very unusual for this city!), and is a real bargain. We booked in advance (in May) through the central Husa website, and got the room for just under \u00a370 per night, and for that price it is outstanding. If it is your first visit to the city, you might prefer to stay closer to the best-known tourist locations, but we have been to Madrid frequently, and this was a great place to be based, amid the shops and cafes of the upmarket Salamanca district, with a Metro station five minutes walk away, buses and cab ranks close by, and a relaxed, lesiurely stroll to the centre of the city. The room was a good size, the bathroom excellent, particularly good wifi internet connection, and the beds guaranteed a good night's sleep. Perhaps a small armchair would have made the room more comfortable, and some visitors might lament the lack of any non-Spanish TV channels. Staff were always helpful at the front desk, and the daily cleaning of the room was particularly thorough and efficient. Cannot comment on the breakfasts as we paid a room-only rate and used the numerous local cafes (Le Pain Quotidien is especially good). We have stayed in fancier Madrid hotels, but we have never stayed in one which offered such quality at such a good price.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat central location!

It's a 3.5 to a 4 star hotel. It's elegant, clean and provides great service. The area is safe. The staff are very helpful, welcoming and friendly.

Cortes Ingles, which is a main department store with a supermarket, is right around the corner. The neighbourhood is upscale. It's like the Rodeo Drive of Madrid. You have your Gucci, Louis Vutton, Armani stores around the corner. There are cafes around the area for breakfast/snacks. Taxi to Puerta Del Sol, which is the centre of main attractions is about 8 Euros and 10 minutes away. There is an elevator and luggage storage at this hotel. The best night club in town is El Kapital. It has 7 floors of all kinds of music playing. It's worth the 15-20 Euros cover charge at this night club. Dress up though.
