The breakfast is delicious and there is plenty of it so definitely worth booking this as it is good value for money. The room was spacious for a capital city hotel we were lucky enough to have a view of the Hotel Invalides. The shower a bit temperamental but good water pressure and a bath too! The air conditioning was very welcome as it was a hot weekend and it worked very effectively. There are lots of eateries nearby and we can recommend the creperie just down from the hotel. Things to Do The Eiffel tower is nearby as is the Hotel Invalides and the Champs Elysee. We recommend the Green Open Tour sightseeing bus. A two day ticket cost \u20ac32 per person, but there are four different routes and over 50 stops. It is a good way to see Paris! There are lots of eating places nearby, but definitely suggest you get some recommendations on places to eat prior to your visit. The hotel can make reservations for you. The Louvre is great, but a nightmare with people traffic, suggest going at lunchtime to avoid excessive queues!

Inside, the hotel is quirky and original, a far cry from bland professionalism and predictability of chain hotels, but not short of a good standard. The rooms are very small, and would try even the closest couple if you were staying longer than a couple of nights, but this should be balanced by their originality in design, and the atmosphere of the place.

Try and book a room on the top floor, we were staying on the first floor (that's the second floor to Americans) and we could hear it quite a lot, but our friends were staying on the floor above us and said it wasn't as loud for them. Each room is different so I can only comment on our room and our friends' room. We stayed in room 15, a superior double room, which was quite spacious with a nice bathroom and shower. But our friends stayed in a standard room (room 26) and had a bigger bathroom with a bath!! Which didn't really make sense, but I guess they do what they can with the space for each room. They didn't have a mini bar and their room was also much smaller than ours. The view from our window was non-existent, we were facing another building but if you stay at the front of the hotel I'm guessing the view would be fine. The reception staff were always friendly and helpful, and the hotel has free wifi and a laptop and printer to use (very useful when you forget to print important documents like I did!) and we tried the hammam - which is very small but nice to relax. It is in the exercise room which is hilariously small but I'm guessing no one goes to Paris to exercise anyway as so much walking is done! We all received nice white robes and slippers, as well as fresh towels every day and the beds were turned down each night which were lovely touches. However we were rather jealous of our friends who received a small bottle of champagne and macaroons on arrival but we didn't - why not?! Breakfast I can't comment on as we didn't bother - with all the patisseries around serving pastries and coffees, it's not worth paying 16 euros each for breakfast at the hotel.

The bed was comfortable and we had no problems with noise, either internal or external (we were on the second floor) - maybe an advantage of travelling in February. The bathroom is undoubtedly small - a shower only with no bath. But everything was clean and functioning, so no problem for us.

It\u2019s a charming little hotel with a lovely tiny lobby once you have passed the romantic blooming entrance. And for a Parisian hotel the staff is quite lovely too. But the fairytale stops there.... When awarded a room, you have to squeeze in their shabby tiny elevator and/or climb noisy wooden stairs to squeeze into your shoebox room. The decoration is tappe \u00e0 l\u2019oeuil (canopy, vivid colours\u2026) but the underneath is not really clean and worn out. Beddings are horrible old and saggy. The bathroom is poorly renovated and mine was dirty with only one cheap little piece of soap. Impossible to get into the room without dragging your bags behind you or shoving them first in. Furthermore I really don\u2019t imagine how a person sized 14plus will made it through the tiny corridor leading to the bed (No offence, I\u2019m a tall 12-14 and I had already my trouble). Don\u2019t bring more than you negligee as their \u201cwardrobe\u201d is a small alcove. And don\u2019t go shopping, there\u2019s no room for extra bags. Well then there\u2019s what makes about 60 % of your room: your tiny bed. Mine stood one side against the wall, leaving you as little as approx. 60 cm to the other side. The nightstand is a tablet fixed on the wall above your bed, watch your head! Once you\u2019re installed in your un-cozy bed, you\u2019ll have the pleasure the hear something rumble every 10 minutes or so\u2026 I must be the tube ore something, but in any case it\u2019s annoying. And in the morning you\u2019ll go the lovely yet tiny and oppressing cellar (all stone like a wine cellar) to take your tasty breakfast, but: as everything is so small you won\u2019t have much choice at all. At least they have chouquettes, the tiny French pastry ball :) So if you're petite or a dwarf... go for it. I mean I have seen worse especially in Paris.

The front desk was very friendly and helpful. The location was great as it was walking distance to the Eiffel tower and Siene river and across from the metro station.

We were also given a room in the top floor which had awnings outside the window which partially covered the view and looked at bit worn down and old. If we ever go back, we'll request the rooms below which had a nice window with flowers. One thing I wish they did was make the bed over completely every day so we could appreciate the charming bedding during our whole stay instead of just the first day. They do not place the bed duvet and sham pillows back in the bed after they make them over - probably due to laziness as it may take longer.

We chose Hotel de Latour Maubourg mainly because it was in 7e (my wife wanted to stay near Eiffel) & it was near a metro station. This location is absolutely perfect for 1st timers. You are in walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, Invalides, Rue de Cler, Cafes, & the metro. The room we stayed in (33) was pretty small, but from the reviews we have read, most European hotel rooms were pretty small anyways. You do have your own A/C unit for your room, private bathroom, TV (even though it's all in French, haha), money safe, comfortable bed, & telephone. For local calls, you have to dial \"0\" then the number. The hotel's appearance & cleanliness was very good. My wife loved the entrance to the hotel because of the huge mirror where she \"checked herself out\" on the way in and out, haha. The elevator (lift) is very small but I think that is normal in Paris. However, it did serve its purpose though when all you do is walk all day around the city. The whole hotel has wireless internet with no password required. So if you turn your phone on \"plane mode\" before you leave the US, you can use your phone to communicate for free with Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc.) The hotel's staff was very kind and spoke english very well. They are very helpful when trying to get to a specific location in Paris. I found this kind of weird though... you have to leave your room key with the person at the desk when you go out, then ask for it back when you return. That might be with every hotel in Paris though. I would recommend stacking up on water, cokes, etc at the Hotel before you go for the day. The Hotel sells bottled water and cokes for $2 euros each and the cafes and other stores are much more than that. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend The Hotel de Latour Maubourg to anyone visiting Paris. We loved our stay for 6 nights. Feel free to ask me any questions and I will answer them as best as I can.

We had to book a hotel for one more night in Paris after a quick jaunt down to the Pyrenees before returning home, and we were really impressed with the hotel so we decided to stay there again. Fortunately, they had a room available at late notice. It's a beautiful small Parisian hotel and exactly what we were wanting to experience whilst visiting. The location is fantastic. It's right next door to the Invalides (and Napolean's tomb) with the St Germain and Eiffel Tower area at your doorstep. The Rodin Museum is also a 5 minute walk away. The metro stop (LaTour Maubourg) is opposite the street making it easy to take the metro from the airport or main train stations to the hotel. Within walking distance, there are excellent restaurants nearby - a nice take-away sandwhich shop on the corner, or try Rue de Cler for a good variety of food and budgets including excellent icecream from Amorino, only 5 mins walk away. Adding to its excellent location is that it's a 5 minute walk to the riverbank and about 10 minutes to view the Eiffel Tower. There are many parks in the area if you just want to laze about on a beautiful summer afternoon too. The room in general was typically small like European hotels, with not much storage or hanging space. Neverthless, it was easily manageable with two people and luggage for 5 weeks. Being literally on top of the metro, there was the occassional rumble as it went past, but nothing that kept us awake. Breakfast at the hotel was also good, but a little pricey for a continental only breakfast. However with so many patisseries nearby, we only ate there once. The hotel also offers free use of a hamman, but with so many things to do in Paris, we didn't get the opportunity to use it. WiFi service is also free throughout the hotel, and VERY good. So if you're stopping by Paris, I'd definitely recommend Latour Maubourg, no matter how long or short the stay.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marlborough, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAdorable Parisian Hotel - Best deal in Paris\u201d", "Author": "RCTily", "ReviewID": "UR115028571", "Content": "Loved this hotel.

Would highly recommend getting the train instead of spending money on a private mini bus (78 euro). If your completely lazy you can get the tube across the road (Mauborg stop) one stop to invalides but you would be crazy to spoil the short walk along the avenue at invalides. The invalides metro stop is right at the famous Pont Alexander bridge that crosses the Seine. Eiffel tower is a short 10 minute walk.

We were absolutely delighted when we arrived at our hotel - it was PERFECT - they upgraded us to a deluxe suite at no additional charge, the staff was welcoming, helpful, gracious. The location was perfect for us - across the street literally from the metro line that went every place that we wanted to go ~ very safe area, amazing restraurant right next door. We had a little trouble parking - there isn't a garage necessarily close, but we finally lucked out and parked right across the street - it's a little bit of trouble because the meters have to be \"fed\" every 4 hours, but we took the metro to wherever, came home for the meter and to refresh, and were gone again! Finally on the weekend the meter is off and you can park for free. The hotel room itself was great, the bed was amazing, sweet continental breakfast which was great ~ they left us goodies and a bottle of champagne with their label on New Year's Eve - we thought that was such a sweet touch! About 5 block very easy walk to the Eiffel Tower, across the street from the Invalides where Napoleon is buried, and a very easy metro ride to anything else.

Upon arrival we discovered we had been given a complimentary upgrade to the Napoleon Suite which literally took our breath away. The decor was tasteful and traditional adding to the overall age of the property. Our son at 15 months was very comfortable in his cot and had more than enough space to play and crawl around. The roll top bath was a particular enjoyment of my husband who spent much time indulging each morning. The breakfast was as you would expect and served in our rooms for our additional comfort. The porter was only too pleased to bring warm milk at 5am when our son woke and their help in navigating around Paris was much appreciated. Overall i have no complaint as all staff we encountered were very friendly and helped make our stay more pleasant than we anticipated. Our thanks particularly to Sofia who was most helpful throughout and even looked after our son briefly while we got bags sorted.

The neighbourhood felt very safe, even at night and it was very quiet. Lots of the main attractions were within walking distance. The room size was small but adequate with plenty of storage space and thoughtful touches. The room was clean and charming. The decor was interesting, with an unusual but plesant colour combination of red, aqua green and mustard. I nicknamed it the Elephant room , due to the elephants on the curtains and the elephant table lamps. We were on the third floor in room 311, so had no problem with noise from rooms above us. (But maybe we were disturbing the people below us, sorry guys) You could faintly hear the metro but it never bothered us or stopped us from sleeping. The beds were small, just a double but we had no difficulty sleeping. The internet connection was great and there was a free comuter available to guests in the lounge area. The bathroom was tiny but had everything you needed . I would have appreciated a bit more space around the basin. The toiletries were nice and the soap was replaced daily and the other items as needed. One problem was the shower temparature kept changing. The common areas were delightful and colourful with thoughtful touches in theme with the style of the hotel, fresh roses, china and chandeliersand a few books in the lounge. They even have umbrellas available at the door for use by guests. The lift is tiny and only goes to the second floor. It only just held the two of us with no luggage. However the staff offerred to take up our bags up to our room before we even asked them. The staff were all wonderful and very helpful and obliging, they all spoke English and were very friendly. They made excellent restaurant suggestions in the local neighbourhood. We especially recommend La Florimund and Fountain de Mars. They offerred to make our bookings for trips, explained our options and gave us time to think while making their recommendations known. They even noticed that we had a broken light bulb before we did and replaced it promptly. The one thing that we would have appreciated that was not available were tea and coffee making facilities. However there was a bistro right next door. In fact we never ate breakfast in the hotel as it cost 16 euros a person. We felt that this was expensive so ate breakfast out or bought a baguette near by. There is a small supermarket around the corner also a Pizza shop if you are looking for somethng less expensive.

Was immediately impressed with the inside Lobby. Very Chic, bright, clean and classy. The Service at reception was very warm and friendly. We were then directed to our room, 11, which was way above expectation. As a first time visit to Paris, I have nothing to compare the hotel too, however, having stayed in many 3 star hotels, in various cities, this by far superceeded them all. I was surprised it was only a 3 star rating! The room was larger than expected, with high ceilings, chandelier, 2 French Doors opening out to a view across the Fountain and Park over the road, and Les Invalides to the left. Perfect Location - 10 Min walk to the Eiffel Tower, 2 Min to Les Invalides, and on to the most Beautiful Bridge, Pont Alexander 3rd. Over the Bridge is Les Petit Palace and the Grand Palais, Champ D'Elysee, and the Concorde Plaza(?), looking up to the Arc de Triumphe, and with the Lourve a short walk East, aprox 10 Mins. When I return to Paris, I will most certainly be staying at this Hotel again. One minor critisism, however, was there were no Tea or Coffee making facilities, or Mini Bar in the Room. Food and drink in the area was fairly highly priced, which is generally what you expect to pay, however the Latin Quarter was good for selection and cost. I have read reviews about the Metro being a problem. We were located on the first floor, and all you could hear of the Metro was a very faint rumbling. Having stayed in City centres before, this most certainly was by far the quietest. No sound of Traffic, no sirens, no drunken revellers in the street.

I dont like to leave bad reviews (see my other reviews) but I have to be honest here. We booked directly with the hotels own online reservation system. Our rate was 170 Euro. The room was tiny, but honestly I have stayed in smaller. So the size wasnt unacceptable. The bed was not comfortable but again, the big comfortable bed is more of an American thing. The sheets were appalling. Practically threadbare and not so fresh smelling. The bedspread looked to have the dead skin cells of thousands of previous guests. Could have used a good shake. The room did not have a bad odor, despite looking a little down about the heels. It was quite dark in the room. I got the feeling that a very low wattage lighbulb contributed to the gloomy ambiance. The bathroom was fine - plumbing worked well, water pressure/temperature good. Towels good- Some softer than others. They gave you a packet of tiny bathroom amenities but these were not replaced after the first day. You got it once and that was it. Breakfast was not included in our 170 euro rate so we got coffee and croissants in the neighborhood - plenty of choices. The hotel is right across the street from LaTour Maubourg Metro stop. We have been to Paris many many times and the 7e is my very favorite place to stay in Paris. The hotel's location cannot be beat. The staff were very warm and accommodating. We know the area quite well so we didnt need directions or require much help. They offered help rather than wait for us to ask. The hotel is old. That is no ones fault. But it must be mentioned that the place is a little creaky. The people above us were early risers and we heard every step they took. Squeak squeak squeak. I'm not sure what can be done about that. Better insulation??? Earplugs??? I have stayed in some pretty awful places in France in my lifetime and I have never complained because I've always felt you get what you pay for. I have to say, I do not feel I got what I paid for after staying here. We stayed two nighs and honestly, I would not have wanted to stay longer. Although there were some hits and misses our room would have been entirely acceptable had it been about 100 euro, but for 170 euro, I expected better. Room #25 is not worth 170 Euro.

Maybe it was just in my room, but literally every three or four minutes, you feel the rumbling of trains from the metro line beneath the hotel. Not only did this disrupt my sleep (though it did subside completely from about midnight to 6 am or 7 am), but it made for a generally un-relaxing stay. I was only booked for one night, but had I been scheduled to stay longer, I would have needed to change to a non-affected room (if possible), or I would have moved from the hotel. I was also not happy with the way the hotel handled the situation. They clearly have had this complaint before, but they offered nothing in the way of compensation for a fairly unpleasant night. Not even so much as an offer of breakfast. The implied contract with a hotel has a reasonable expectation of quiet; Why should I pay over $250/ night for a room with trains rumbling beneath it, literally vibrating the walls every few minutes? It just doesn't seem quite right. Were it not for the metro noise/ vibration issue, I would recommend this hotel to someone looking for a 3-star in a great location. but given the problem, and given the unsatisfactory way in which it was handled, I definitely would not return, and I would hesitate to recommend it unless the hotel assured that the specific room would not have a noise/ vibration issue.

The room itself was not big but reading many reviews this seems to be normal for Paris. There was a minibar (nice prices 2 euro for coca cola).

The room and bathroom were nicely furnished, clean and comfortable, yet very small by North American standards. The room had air conditioning which is pretty uncommon for Europe and a welcome surprise. The hotel serves a nice continental breakfast buffet of cereals, fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, pastries, juice and coffee. I really enjoyed the continental breakfasts in Europe and the Latour Maubourg did not disappoint. The staff were nice, friendly people. The only problem I faced was with the airport transfer. I asked the guy at the front desk for change for a 20 euro note. He proceeded to give me 10 euros in change, which I only noticed while in the van on my way to the airport. I explained this to the driver and he said that he'd take care of it. I gave the driver the 10 euros at the end of the trip assuming the transfer company would take it up with the hotel. The hotel ended up charging my credit card for the full cost of the transfer. So basically the front desk guy ripped me off for 10 euros and the driver ripped me off for the other 10.

I had read previous comments on Trip Advisor and found the praises to be accurate and the complaints to be overblown. It is primarily the warmth and responsiveness of the staff that made our stay so pleasant. It is more like the attention you receive at a good bed and breakfast with the amenities of a hotel.

I was completely sure that the staff would link us efficiently and effectively with whatever care was required. From the beginning, the staff responded to e-mails promptly. By booking directly with them, we were able to reserve a Superior room at a considerable savings. The room was ready when we arrived. While the closet was a bit small due to its triangular shape, we had no problem storing all of our clothes. We enjoyed the Empire d\u00e9cor of the room which was what we expected from the photos on the web site. There were one or two small spots on the bathroom woodwork that needed a spot of paint subsequent to a repair, but the room was clean and in good repair. We did not experience problems with sound transmission through the walls. Since the hallway is small, one does hear people passing, but it was not problematic. The mattresses were a bit worn, but we had no problem sleeping. We are not big breakfast people, so we only ate in the hotel once. It actually seemed like a fair price to us, given the quantity and quality of food available. We did usually eat at cafes and enjoyed crepes for breakfast at the Caf\u00e9 Latour Maubourg. The Internet availability was very helpful to me. The location is terrific and the Metro stop across the street couldn\u2019t be better.

We were moved to another room and upgraded to a lovely big room at about 2 in the morning. Unfortunately, we could still hear running water and my hubby was getting cranky from lack of sleep. The poor guy on reception did his best and was most helpful under difficult circumstances. I guess the plumbing in these old buildings can be quite tricky as I had difficulty sleeping another night also. I must say though that every morning we were asked if the room was ok and if we had any problems, and offered another move if we wanted.

The standard double was not the largest of rooms as you come to expect in Paris but was certainly clean, had everything you needed and in keeping with the other charmingly eclectic touches of the hotel was perfectly judged. Our superior room (23 as I recall) even more so. The location just across from the landmark Military Museum is both beautiful and perfect for any stay in the city. Bikes, Taxis, and the Metro all just around the corner ready to get you to where ever else may take your fancy but if you've not stayed in this part of town before there are some lovely spots to discover within walking distance.

We spent a little more than our original budget, but we started planning the trip relatively late and other potential hotels were booked. This turned out to be fortunate for us. The front desk staff was very attentive, and even the night shift guys were on top of their game. Our room was right behind the reception desk (room 3) which at first seemed a bit unusual, but it became an advantage to us. We could not hear the front desk once the doors were closed, and the convenience of having our room right there was nice, especially when we forgot something and had to go right back to the room. We had our own door to the interior courtyard, which we made good use of. The room was the classic room, but we had space for 2 suitcases plus a closet. The bathroom was sufficient, although we would have liked some additional shelf space to spread out toiletries and such. We traveled with a friend who had another room in the same hotel, and she reported it to be a bit smaller but quiet and just what she expected. We arrived early and they made us some excellent coffee to enjoy while we waited for our room, which we expected to take a few hours but took only an hour. They even brought our heavy luggage into the room for us. A note about the breakfast: We too thought it was rather expensive at 16 euro per person, but in reality it was a decent value. First off it is all you can eat, and second the food is really good and the coffee is exceptional. Compared to a cafe, where you get just one cup of coffee, one croissant or piece of bread, and one glass of juice, usually for about 9-10 euros, the hotel breakfast was a better, more delicious deal. We would eat in the hotel every day if we had it to do over again. The location of the hotel was very good, with the Metro across the street next to a taxi stand, and convenient access by walking to many sites. We walked to the Eiffel Tower several times, to the Orsay, Invalides (next door) and even the Arc (kind of a long walk). The neighborhood was excellent, the restaurant right next door (La Source) had good food and friendly service, and all the restaurants we went to nearby were good. Having gone all around Paris on this trip we became familiar with the other areas we could have stayed, but we thought this location was ideal compared to the other places we researched. I complement the entire front desk staff, the housekeeping, and the breakfast room staff.

Maid service was very attentive and we lacked for nothing, even ice upon request, which was a plus since Paris was very warm for a few days and we also really appreciated the A/C. The friendly desk staff were helpful and attentive. My daughter enjoyed the free internet access so she could still communicate with her friends. We never ate the breakfast due to the cost and besides all of Paris was right outside our door inviting us to enjoy the fabulous bakeries and cafes.

My boyfriend (now fiance) chose the Hotel de Latour Maubourg for our 3-night stay after much deliberation (he planned this months in advance) and I can't recommend it highly enough for a romantic weekend away, especially for a proposal (such as happened to me!). The hotel is perfectly located, so close to the Eiffel tower (5-10 mins walk) and les Invalides. Easily within walking distance to some great palces along the Seine and interesting markets (e.g. Saxe-Breteuil - amazing). Not to mention the Metro station just opposite, which allows you access to many places of interest within 10 or 15 minutes at most (Montmartre, the Louvre, Notre Dame, etc). Rue Cler (some say is the best food market street in Paris), is 5 mins walk away (check out Davoli!), and there is an endless choice of cafes, boulangeries and restaurants also within a short walk. I have read the 'very poor', 'poor' and 'average' reviews on here and I don't understand the comments at all! Contrary to previous reviews, we did not hear a peep from the Metro or any noise from cafes outside - we thought the room was very well insulated. Heard the occasional noise from an adjoining room but this wasn't a problem at all. We had a packed itinerary, setting off early each morning and came back for a lovely nap in the afternoon before setting off again. The location allowed us to do this. We stayed in Room 23 on the 2nd floor which overlooked a pretty park opposite the hotel. I can see how the decor may not be to some people's taste but we found it to be eclectic, interesting and different, yes, a little kitsch but nothing wrong with that! The room was impeccably clean and we were so impressed with the extra little touches like the turn down service, roses in the bathroom, digital room safe, hotel umbrellas free to borrow at the entrance, free hammam and free high speed wireless internet should you need it. Can't comment on the breakfast as we did not sample it (a bit expensive at 16 Euros I suppose and we preferred to go to the boulangeries) but the salle and little courtyard garden were lovely. The room was not huge but then I doubt many in Paris are very big - there was certainly enough room to unpack and store 2 large cases and a large double wardrobe, a desk, plenty of power points etc. As for the desk service - fantastic. My boyfriend wanted to impress me by asking for everything but doesn't speak perfect French. The ladies were patient and kind and allowed him to make his point, rather than talking to him in English, and if he got stuck they were happy to switch back. Always friendly, happy and smiling and ready to assist, any time of day and night. We both recommend this hotel highly and would go back without hesitation.

We selected the hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews, hotel price and location (we wanted to stay somewhere that was fairly central to the main attractions and with good access to the Metro). Hotel Location: The hotel is situated right on the edge of Les Invalides and directly outside the La Tour Maubourg Metro station. There are enough cafes and restaurants nearby to satisfy most people. The hotel is well placed for attractions being a 15-20 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysees and Jardin des Tuileries. There is a lovely view from the front of the hotel over a small park area with a fountain. The reservation: We booked the room directly through the hotel website as I prefer to deal directly with the hotel rather than through a third-party booking agency. Making the reservation was easy and we quickly received email confirmation of our booking. We then received a futher email from the hotel requesting information about our preferences regarding beds (double, twin, etc.), newspapers and even the colour of the roses (nice touch). Although check-in is from 1:00 pm the hotel said that they would try to have the room ready earlier as we expected to arrive around 9:00 am. Check-in: We arrived at the hotel at 1.00 pm (we walked the couple of miles from St Michel to the hotel and stopped for breakfast so we were later than anticipated) although true to their word the hotel had made the room available from 10:00 am. The welcome we received from Eva on reception was great and we immediately felt very much at home The room: We opted for the junior suite as our daughter is only 5 years of age and we expected to be spending quite a lot of time in the room, particularly in the evening. The room was placed on the top (3rd) floor and I would guess has been converted from what was once the attic. The suite consisted of a lounge area with desk and chaise longue (which doubled as an extra bed), a bedroom area with a huge double bed, a separate bathroom with a shower, separate bath and twin wash basins. The toilet was in its own room at the other end of the suite from the bathroom. The decor of the room was quite unusual, having a plum coloured theme with printed fabric covering the walls. With the suite being in the attic there were skylights in place of normal windows. There was a minibar in the room and space for storing clothes in the bathroom. There was an LCD television mounted on a wall above the desk. Although slightly unconventional, the suite was really nice and comfortable and we loved it. Hotel services: We didn't make much use of the hotel services (breakfast, bar, etc.) so it's not possible to pass comment on these areas. The reception staff we dealt with were very good and were able to provide any information that we required about the city and its attractions. A nice touch was the free wireless internet connection. The stay: Housekeeping did a great job of keeping the room clean and tidy during our stay and overall we were very happy with all aspects of the hotel service. Other information: The complimentary bottle of champagne in our room on arrival was a perfect start to the holiday. Shutters on the skylights could be closed by remote control - very useful for keeping the room dark in the morning. Also, with the room being at the very top of the hotel you didn't get other guests passing your room waking you up. The air conditioning was excellent. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. The shower was a bit on the small side. Having the clothes storage in the bathroom was slightly unusual. The toilet didn't have a towel rail in the room so the towel had to be tucked behind the basin tap - a small point but the sort of detail I would expect to be covered with an advertised room rate of 460 euros per night. The ceiling sloped at either side into the eaves making the suite feel smaller than it actually was. I tended to duck when I didn't need to and then forget to keep my head down when I should have :) High points: Paris is still a fantastic city although I prefer it out of the summer season. The public transport system is superb and relatively cheap. La Tour Maubourg is a great hotel if what you want is somewhere comfortable and quiet to stay within easy reach of the heart of Paris. We got a good deal on the room rate which made it a lot more affordable. Low points: Wow! Paris is expensive these days if you are visiting from the UK. Don't expect to pay less than 10-15 euros (\u00a38-12) for a fairly basic meal. A pint (well, 500ml) beer will set you back around 8 euros (\u00a36-7) in just about any standard bar/restaurant in the city centre. We paid over 30 euros (\u00a325) for 2 croissants, 2 small pieces of bread, 1 crepe, 1 lemonade and 2 coffees. I thought that Disneyland was overpriced (139 euros or \u00a3110 entry charge for 2 adults and a child for the most basic entrance package) and overcrowded - expect to queue for 20 to 90 minutes for most of the rides. The food was not great or cheap their either. Conclusion: This is a lovely little (only 17 rooms I believe) hotel in a great location. This hotel is probably not for people who expect a huge range of hotel services to be available but as a base to expore the city it is absolutely perfect.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cHelpful staff, great location\u201d", "Author": "frey77", "ReviewID": "UR28174590", "Content": "We spent a week in Paris staying in the Hotel de Latour Maubourg after trawling through Paris hotels on Trip Advisor. We normally stay in large modern hotels, but rapidly found that such things in Paris are either very expensive or not in the centre of the city. So instead we went with the reviews and booked a superior room in the Latour Maubourg. First things first, the hotel immediately confirmed our booking with a personal email asking if there was anything they could do to make our stay better, whether we needed a shuttle pick-up from the airport etc. We thought this was a nice, personal, touch and replied that we were arriving very early in the morning (7am!) and it would be nice if we could leave our bags until check-in time. In actuality when we arrived they had a room ready for us (5 hours before normal check-in time) which was unexpected and really really good. The staff were very friendly throughout our stay and spoke very good English. We stayed in a superior room which was pretty large and comfortable. It had a big window, which opened out onto a small courtyard. This was fine for fresh air, but obviously you're not getting a view. We knew this from looking at the website, and it wasn't a concern for us. It seemed to us that the deluxe rooms probably had the view from the front of the hotel. Not being at the front of the hotel did mean that the room was nice and quiet which was good after all the traffic noise you get in central Paris (did I mention the million scooters?). As has been mentioned in other reviews the furniture is a bit quirky, but the bed was really large and comfortable and there was a nice chest of drawers and it all seemed to go together pretty well. The bathroom was a little worn around the edges, but it never gave us any issues. The location of the hotel is worth a mention as it's very, very good. There's a metro stop literally 20 metres from the front door which is a great thing when you've been wandering around Paris all day and your feet hurt. The neighbourhood is very nice to walk around. It's not as busy as a lot of other places in Paris and there are a lot of nice restaurants and cafes. There are three cafes within 50m of the hotel, two of which are fairly normal cafe/brasserie places which do good food for reasonable prices. The other one (cafe esplanade) is a bit more sophisticated and expensive, but well worth it as they do a great breakfast with nice views of Les Invalides. There's a pedestrian food market area on Rue Cler (a couple of minutes walk away) which has a load of great food shops/stalls on it. We went there and bought some bread, fruit and cheeses and it was a lot of fun. We also tried the Italian restaurant, Pupi, which was recommended in another review, and found it was just as good as reported. There's also this Eiffel tower thing, which is about a 5 minute walk away, easily close enough to stroll over after dinner and watch the lights come on (which we did severla times). We made extensive use of the free wireless internet the hotel provides. We used our iPhone for this and it allowed us to use the web which was very convenient to check opening times for museums, locations for restaurants etc. I don't think this is necessarily a common feature in Paris hotels and it added a lot of value for us. All in all we found our stay to be really good, and would stay here again. The personal feel to this hotel is really significant.

My wife and I took the Eurorail from London where we stayed 3 nights (you'll see a review for the Asbhurn Hotel as well). Metro to this hotel from the train station was easy. The Metro stop is literally right across the street from this hotel in a beautiful park setting. The Hotel is right in front of you as you exit the Metro stop and looks exactly like the pictures on this site. A beautiful facade in a neighborhood setting with visible cafes and brasseries on the corners. The reception area is charming and the lobby area is well appointed; albeit on the smaller side. The girls at the reception get an A+ They were all very warm and welcoming and spoke very good english. It was much appreciated since our French was very limited to the basic please/thank you, etc. Their restaurant recommendations were great too; try the casual Italian place just about a 10 minute walk down the street. The wait staffed there is very welcoming and didn't mind us cutting up their beautiful language. Prices are reasonable for awesome atmosphere and even better staff. We booked a queen/double and got what we paid for. In actuality, the bed was more the size of the double but we slept fine for the one night. If we were there for longer we would have asked for or paid for a larger bed. The room was smaller than I expected (even by European standards), but we only used the room to rest - so it wasn't a big deal. The layout of the room was fine, a bit cramped but since we only packed one small bag between the two of us, it was fine. There is a safe in the room which was nice and we used it. The bathroom was nice and clean, but we couldn't get the towel dryer to work. We didn't ask them to look at it and I'm sure they would have. Again, not a huge deal for a 1 night stay. Good hot water and good water pressure. Our room was on the 3rd floor and over-looked over rooves and buildings - so upgrade if you want a room with a view. The room was a bit 'dark' for our taste. It was well appointed with flowing drapery, etc., but the combination of a dark carpet and dark colorerd bed spread and brown curtains, made the room 'feel' smaller than it was. We pulled back the curtains and let the light into the room. It felt better. No noise from other rooms - so that was a huge plus. Overall, our experience was good. This hotel offered a very good location (a 15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and much more), great attentive service, a boutique french experience we were seeking and a really cool, 2 person elevator to take you up to your room.", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "nashville", "Title": "\u201cCharmed by the impeccable service\u201d", "Author": "marianne202", "ReviewID": "UR25807293", "Content": "We were in Paris for a long weekend - it was not really a pleasure trip - a close family member was very ill and in the hospital.

All I can say is, wow did I make the right choice. As others have already mentioned, the location is perfect. Close enough to most anything you'd want to see in Paris (actually perfect for day trips to Versailles, now that I think of it). Yet when you return to the 7th, it's like coming home. A quite, peaceful, area with just enough hustle and bustle, but without the overwhelming amount like other areas of Paris I've stayed in (1st, 8th i.e.). As far as the Hotel itself, it is a restored private mansion and still has that feeling about it. I stayed in Room 14 which was decorated magnificently in Napoleon 111 style. For those that critized the decoration of the rooms, I'll include a picture of the Napoleon 111 rooms from the Louvre. Strikingly similar, huh? It's called taste and style. May not be for everyone. If you are happy with the Motel 6 style back in the states, as opposed to this style, maybe this isn't the place for you. In fact maybe Paris (the fashion capital of the world) wouldn't be the place for you period, but I digress. Finally, the staff (Sarah, Roberta, Anne Sophie, Silvia, Patrick, etc.) all made the stay in this wonderful Hotel that much better. I must give you an example of the type of service they provided me. The last day of my stay I slipped on a wet cobblestone and threw my back out severely. They were able to arrange for me a doctor (service called SOS) at midnight who treated me right in the room. When it was time to check out the next morning, (I barely remember it as the medication the doctor gave me was very strong, and I had tried treating myself earlier with some Armagnac) they assured I made it safely to the airport. The pain was gone, but man was I in a daze. My apologies and also sincere thanks to the staff for putting up with me. In addition the staff was able to make reservations at local restaurants for me, as I am French challenged. I ate at one three times because it was so good (La Fountaine De Mars). The Cassoulet was fit for a King. It was ten minute beautiful walk from the Hotel, yet there is a Bistrot right next door that I used for late night snacks(Croque Monsieurs, etc.) and other excellent local restaurants right around the corner. If they'll have me back, I'll only stay at this hotel in the future. Both for it's beauty, class, but most of all for the staff that made me feel welcome with their smiles everyday after my long walks. And one more thing the Hamman (steamroom) is perfect for after a long day of tiring muscles out. Make sure they turn the temperature up (40C is perfect for me) and you will be ready to \"paint the town\".

I looked at the Hotel de Latour Maubourg, called and spoke with the receptionist, and booked this hotel for our third trip to Paris in April. We were absolutely charmed. The hotel itself is beautiful, the staff is eager to please, and we agree with other reviewers that it's a wonderful choice for Paris. Upon arrival from Seville, we took the Air France bus from Orly to Invalides, hopped one stop on the Metro and exited right in front of the hotel. We had booked a standard room and were told with an apology that our room was not available - would we accept an upgrade to a suite with their compliments? Heck, yes - so we found ourselves in a lovely, large room (the one with the red walls on the website), with full height windows facing the leafy square. The bathroom also had a full-length window and soaking tub/shower. It was just gorgeous - lots of light, space, and closet room. But while many hotels look nice, it's the staff that make the difference, and I can say with gratitude that people at the Hotel de Latour Maubourg were just wonderful. Our last day, when attempting to get some cash at the ATM, my card was swallowed by the machine. Great - it was a French holiday, so the banks were closed. What do we do now? Roberta not only let us use the desk phone (for about a half hour), but spoke in French when needed to explain the situation and reassured us that she would help resolve any problems. We did speak with our credit card issuer in the US, and everything turned out to be fine, but her quiet confidence was beyond the call of duty. We were very, very pleased with our choice, and highly recommend the hotel. Thank you!

We had a wonderful stay with this hotel, even though the room was very small, and my husband did hit his head a couple of times, we found the room to be cosy, quaint and very comfortable. We didn't hear the noise that other reviews have commented on, and we thought that the decor was really nice in comparison to some other hotels we had stayed in. One thing that we loved was the staff in this hotel. Everytime we needed to organise something they were so eager to help and so patient. We needed to confirm one of our tour bookings, but this is made difficult by the fact that we don't speak french, but the ladies on the front desk were more than willing to help. Even though she was put on hold for some time. It always felt that nothing was a problem for these girls and after three weeks in Italy and especially where the service in our previous hotel was so poor, we were so appreciative of the help and professional attitudes of these people. The completely contradicted the warnings that other travellers had given us about the Parisians. We didn't opt to have breakfast at the hotel, because we did think that it was a little expensive, but we found some lovely cafes just around the corner that served breakfast for reasonable prices. If you feel tired from a day of wandering around Paris, the little bar/restaurant next door to the hotel offers a nice menu with some really wonderful staff. We enjoyed their company so much that we went there three times over our four night stay. I thiink the other fantastic aspect of this hotel is purely the location. We walked everywhere. It is literally two hundred metres from Les Invalides and a ten to fifteen minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. Just across the road from Les Invalides is a bus stop where can catch the local buses or the Open Tour buses which are great to do if you want to give your legs a rest. Even better, the metro is just across the road from the hotel also. So there is an abundance of public transport around to help you with your stay. But, we walked everywhere from here.

The hotel has 3 sizes of rooms: standard, superior and deluxe. My husband and I booked a superior. We were coming to Paris at the end of a lengthly trip to Italy and had four bags. The \"superior\" room overlooked an air shaft and was so tiny the bags literally would not fit in it. They moved us to the \"deluxe\" room, which was medium sized and would accommodate our bags, but at 300 euros a night it was outrageously overpriced. The decorations, which look quite splendid on the website, are pathetic. Like an amateur tried to decorate a room from flea markets. There was no soundproofing and you could hear everything from the rooms next to you and on top of you. On the plus side, the beds were comfortable. The staff on the front desk was also very, very good, especially Roberta, and helped us with special requests and dinner reservations without a trace of the Parisian attitude. To give the hotel its due (and probably why it charges so much) is the brilliant location. The views from our \"deluxe\" room were fabulous, of a small park off Invalides, Blvd. La Tour Maubourg is one of the neatest boulevards in Paris and is just around the corner from the hotel. This part of the 7th arrondisment has to be the best place to stay in Paris. . . quiet but with plenty of street life, restaurants, shops, etc., upscale (read expensive) but without the tourist trap feel of the Latin Quarter and Saint Germain or the business-like feel of most of the right bank. My husband and I hadn't been in Paris for ten years and were disappointed at how bad the average brasserie and restaurants had become. They were almost uniformily expensive and mediocre, from the neighborhood of the hotel to the Marais and St. Germain. In the hotel's location, avoid the touted Thomieux bistro like the plague, it's totally disgusting. The hotel desk recommends Cafe des Anges around the corner, which is also not very good. But a few blocks away on La Tour Maubourg is a great, rather upscale restaurant, La Cuisine, that I heartily recommend. There's also a very good Thai place, Thai Villa, on the boulevard a few steps from the hotel. All in all, La Tour Maubourg iis a good place to stay if you can afford a \"deluxe\" room and aren't expecting accommodations that look like the photos on the website, if only for the location. My husband and I spent an afternoon walking around the area looking for better hotels.

It is right in front of the la tour maubourg metro stop which is extremely convenient and you cant miss it because its called La tour Maubourg. The reception desk was very nice and helpful. Our room was number 3 right behind the desk which is different from US hotels but it was surprisingly nice. We didn't here any commotion. We booked the standard room which was plenty if you're on a budget. This room had plenty of room since you here that European hotels rooms are normally small but this room was perfect. It had a nice bathroom and we had our own access to the small garden. Our room was on the backside of the hotel so we didn't here any commotion from the street. The room service was excellent.

It explains the sites you can see in Paris as well as hours of operation and days and times when you can go site see for cheap or for even nothing.

We selected the hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews, hotel price and location (we wanted to stay somewhere that was fairly central to the main attractions and with good access to the Metro). Hotel Location: The hotel is situated right on the edge of Les Invalides and directly outside the La Tour Maubourg Metro station. There are enough cafes and restaurants nearby to satisfy most people. The hotel is well placed for attractions being a 15-20 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysees and Jardin des Tuileries. There is a lovely view from the front of the hotel over a small park area with a fountain. The reservation: We booked the room directly through the hotel website as I prefer to deal directly with the hotel rather than through a third-party booking agency. Making the reservation was easy and we quickly received email confirmation of our booking. We then received a futher email from the hotel requesting information about our preferences regarding beds (double, twin, etc.), newspapers and even the colour of the roses (nice touch). Although check-in is from 1:00 pm the hotel said that they would try to have the room ready earlier as we expected to arrive around 9:00 am. Check-in: We arrived at the hotel at 1.00 pm (we walked the couple of miles from St Michel to the hotel and stopped for breakfast so we were later than anticipated) although true to their word the hotel had made the room available from 10:00 am. The welcome we received from Eva on reception was great and we immediately felt very much at home The room: We opted for the junior suite as our daughter is only 5 years of age and we expected to be spending quite a lot of time in the room, particularly in the evening. The room was placed on the top (3rd) floor and I would guess has been converted from what was once the attic. The suite consisted of a lounge area with desk and chaise longue (which doubled as an extra bed), a bedroom area with a huge double bed, a separate bathroom with a shower, separate bath and twin wash basins. The toilet was in its own room at the other end of the suite from the bathroom. The decor of the room was quite unusual, having a plum coloured theme with printed fabric covering the walls. With the suite being in the attic there were skylights in place of normal windows. There was a minibar in the room and space for storing clothes in the bathroom. There was an LCD television mounted on a wall above the desk. Although slightly unconventional, the suite was really nice and comfortable and we loved it. Hotel services: We didn't make much use of the hotel services (breakfast, bar, etc.) so it's not possible to pass comment on these areas. The reception staff we dealt with were very good and were able to provide any information that we required about the city and its attractions. A nice touch was the free wireless internet connection. The stay: Housekeeping did a great job of keeping the room clean and tidy during our stay and overall we were very happy with all aspects of the hotel service. Other information: The complimentary bottle of champagne in our room on arrival was a perfect start to the holiday. Shutters on the skylights could be closed by remote control - very useful for keeping the room dark in the morning. Also, with the room being at the very top of the hotel you didn't get other guests passing your room waking you up. The air conditioning was excellent. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. The shower was a bit on the small side. Having the clothes storage in the bathroom was slightly unusual. The toilet didn't have a towel rail in the room so the towel had to be tucked behind the basin tap - a small point but the sort of detail I would expect to be covered with an advertised room rate of 460 euros per night. The ceiling sloped at either side into the eaves making the suite feel smaller than it actually was. I tended to duck when I didn't need to and then forget to keep my head down when I should have :) High points: Paris is still a fantastic city although I prefer it out of the summer season. The public transport system is superb and relatively cheap. La Tour Maubourg is a great hotel if what you want is somewhere comfortable and quiet to stay within easy reach of the heart of Paris. We got a good deal on the room rate which made it a lot more affordable. Low points: Wow! Paris is expensive these days if you are visiting from the UK. Don't expect to pay less than 10-15 euros (\u00a38-12) for a fairly basic meal. A pint (well, 500ml) beer will set you back around 8 euros (\u00a36-7) in just about any standard bar/restaurant in the city centre. We paid over 30 euros (\u00a325) for 2 croissants, 2 small pieces of bread, 1 crepe, 1 lemonade and 2 coffees.

Though Paris hotels are known for their small rooms, this was the smallest room I have ever stayed in. It was probably created by dividing a bigger room and with a width of about 8 feet (I was in #16) it had almost no room to put anything in it. The \"closet\" had a curtain in front of it and was about 18\" wide. Luckily I was traveling alone, with a computer and a carry on--but the room is advertised as a double. If my wife had been with me, and we had a couple more bags, it would have been impossible. There maybe be other Classic Rooms in the hotel that are larger, but you should check which room you are in and make sure. I certainly do not think I got value at 150 euros if room #16 is what other Classic Rooms are like. Even though there may be other attributes that I have not yet sampled, I think the hotel would do well not to advertise these special rates since the implication that what you are getting a normal room at a great promotional price.

We found the hotel to be comfortable, well located and a good value. Getting to and from the hotel was a breeze. Upon arrival at CDG, we took the Roissy bus to Opera (~\u20ac8/person), and then took the Metro to the La Tour Maubourg stop (one carnet, 10 tickets, ~\u20ac12). The hotel is just across a small one-way street from the metro. To return to CDG, we hired one of their \"recommended\" shuttles (~\u20ac36 for two) in order to spend more time in the city before leaving that evening. We stayed in room 33. It was small, but completely adequate and comfortable. My only gripe would be that the toilet is only a few centimeters from the wall. Another issue that may bother some people, but did not bother us, is you can actually hear the metro running to and fro. Otherwise, everything was clean and tidy. The hotel staff were completely professional and helpful. The breakfast was good. It is ~\u20ac16/person and includes everything you see (as opposed to a tiered offering scheme employed by some hotels). I've done better and worse in Europe. We took advantage of what the hotel offered and filled up each day, took only a snack for lunch, then found dinner elsewhere. If you're looking to head out to eat, the hotel can surely direct you to one of many local cafes or restaurants in the vicinity. You can also just head down to Rue Cler where there are many cafes, bakeries, and other shops in which to purchase things to eat. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris as a couple. There was one family of three that I saw, but I think that with the size of the rooms, any more would be pushing it. In the hotel's defense, I didn't see any of the other rooms to determine their adequacy for families.

We stayed for four nights during the first week in December on the recommendation of relatives who in turn had been influenced by Trip Advisor reports. This small Hotel is located in a quiet area and very close to a very unobtrusive Metro station which we used occasionally for trips to the Opera area. For our first view of the buildings fronting the Seine we booked through reception a sightseeing cruise and at 11 Euros for two was a good deal. It does seem that some of the best rates are often obtained using Hotel reception. We chose to walk to those major sights time allowed us to visit but there are of course many forms of alternative transport available from the Hotel, indeed there is a taxi rank near to the local Metro station. There are many restaurants and bars in the vicinity at a variety of prices, we took breakfast in the hotel which was provided at a cost of 15 Euros each down in the cosy and intimate converted cellar where the buffet selection and service were very good. The Hotel is a very old building and part of the charm are the creaks and groans accumulated over some two centuries. Do not expect clinical perfection. We booked a Superior room but on arrival were upgraded to a Delux, it was located on the ground floor facing the front and had, in its formative days been a reception room, large, spacious and magnificent. Bearing in mind the ground floor location it was so quiet and peaceful but this is one of the hotel strengths, the other being the helpful and genuinely friendly nature of all the staff. Whilst in Paris we wanted to see a Show and our selection was the Folies Bergeres to see Cabaret and Reception after much effort booked two balcony tickets on a two for the price of one deal at 54 Euros far better than that obtainable on the Web.So thanks for all the help and advice, for making our stay so pleasurable and for such a memorable visit (inspite of the rain) - AU REVOIR", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cOverall, fantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "EnglandMaximus", "ReviewID": "UR11542169", "Content": "Me and my sister booked a stay at this hotel as part of a Paris break, I have stayed in Paris many times and it is the best hotel I have stayed in over there, The staff were excellant and couldnt do enough for you, we got up-graded to a superior room from a classic, The hotel is spotless and the decor is authentic and modern all in one !!!

I've been to Paris many times for leisure and to aimlessly wander around. I've stayed at a lot of hotels there, usually the big names, Hilton, Mercure, California Hotel, etc. After staying at La Tour Maubourg, I will ONLY stay here when I return to Paris in the future. First and foremost, the staff is beyond wonderful. During the day, Roberta and Caroline start your day off with the most vibrant smile and enthusiasm...they offer suggestions for your day and are very eager to help with any questions. I was in Paris for a few days en route to go home to Texas, after being away for a year in Afghanistan. After my 3 day laziness in Paris, I checked out of the hotel and arrived at CDG airport to find out Air France had gone on strike. Being said, I only had a week to be at home before returning back to work, and being stranded at CDG is no pleasant experience, I know many can vouche for that, and my time was limited. Especially when there is a strike. Anyhow, I notified the La Tour Maubourg and they immediately invited me back and told me my room was waiting for me and if there is anything they could do to help, then please let them know. I hoppped in a cab and returned to this lovely hotel. The girls were genuinely concerned for my troubles and did their best to figure something out and suggest other options. A long story short, it worked out well, I made it home and I cannot wait to stay at this hotel again. I usually day dream about Paris and the sights, now I just think about this cozy little hotel. So, to give you some basic info, which has already been given time and time again on this site, and they are all correct.....the hotel is clean and cozy. Yes, rooms are small, but this is Paris...I thought my room was perfect. Plenty of room, cool atmosphere and decor, CLIMATE CONTROLLED ROOM -TO YOUR DISCRETION, of course the free internet, perfect location, etc etc. I'm telling you, this is my favorite hotel I've stayed anywhere in the world. I consider myself well traveled and this hotel has a special touch that no other has. The staff is amazing, the rooms are clean and continuously looked after, the location is in a weird way perfectly centralized away from crazy traffic and passer bys. I can go on and on. I really enjoyed my stay there, and cannot wait to return. It truly is a gem of a hotel in Paris. As I said, I've stayed at the big name hotels just to have the big room and little things we are use to, to only come up spending entirely way too much money and complaining about a few things when the hotel came up short...every single time. This hotel covers all points a hotel should cover, a rarity in Paris, or Europe for that matter. It's all here. Also, when Roberta and Caroline leave, Sandra takes over and is moving a 100 miles an hour doing what she can to please the guests. I probably had more correspondence with her via telephone, and she blew me away with her natural hospitable manner and enthusiastic attitude. I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris. You actually feel as if you are living in Paris staying here, something I think we all eventually feel one time or another while here, unlike the giant white rooms I use to seek for 'guaranteed' comfort at the others. Don't waste your time with those. Come to this hotel, I promise, you will leave with the same impression I had, or at least I hope you will.

This is my fourth European trip this year. I also travel extensively within the U.S. as well. I do not always provide reviews for every hotel I visit. I consider myself to be a fair ciritic. And I am a hopeless romantic. So, when I read \"how romantic\" this hotel was, I seleted this hotel. Also, the hotel website is beautiful coupled with the favorable reviews from Tripadvisor, I booked this hotel! I stayed for 2 of the originally reserved 6 nights. The staff were excellent, Sanda & Roberta you are both so kind. The location is great if you want to be somewhat removed from the action, but close to the metro. With that being said, the moment I pulled up to the hotel in the taxi, I was immediately taken aback. The hotel webite is not a true representation of this hotel. Once inside, the moment I entered, I realized the decor was gaudy. On the reception desk was a large arrangement of plastic and silk flowers with florescent colored butterflies. As I browsed the reception area I found the florescent color theme throughout the hotel. Tasteless decor. There are bright colors everywhere. The furniture was in the same color scheme. This is not my idea of classy or romantic. It is quite a shame since, this hotel has the potential to be very elegant and beautiful. It has old charm, a winding staircase and a beautiful entrance foyer. This type of old victorian elegance should be accentuated with complimentary decor, not bright florescent color schemes. Clash, I just didn't care at all for the decor at this hotel! As another reviewer described below, \"shabby, chic.\" Once I entered the room it was very dark and as one other reviewer mentioned, noisy. This is due to the open staircase, this didn't bother me, but if you need complete silence to sleep, you may want to ask for an inside room. The bathroom (my utmost pet peeve) not to my standards. I am not expecting the Ritz or Four Seasons for this price, but I like simple, white, clean! Here is the worst feature of this hotel, the towels were very hard. I thought they were the floor mats for the bathroom. I could not wipe my face with them. In addition, I like white sheets on the beds not blue or green sheets. I like white sheets of a medium quality. I asked for softer towels but the replacements were hard as well. Thus, I always travel with one towel and a small pillow. Just to be on the safe side, as I mentioned I travel quite a bit.

We were booked in a room with no shower and a rock hard bed. We asked to change rooms, which they did the next day. The room was a significant improvement but still not worth the money. At this price, I was hoping for some old world elegance but it is more accurately described as shabby chic. The floors squeak, conversations and clinking breakfast dishes can be heard through the walls and floors, and the traffic noise would be unbearable if the windows were opened.

The bed was extremely comfortable which was vital after a day of ambling round the streets of Paris. The hotel is situated in between the Eiffel Tower and Les Hotel Des Invalides. You would think that this would make the area noisy but it was quite the opposite. Nearby were some lovely little shops and caf\u00e9s to sit in or browse and excellent for people watching. The hotel rates were brilliant and very, very reasonable, especially for the standard of hotel. The manager and the other girls were very insightful and really helpful, giving us great advice on where to eat and what to visit. Just outside the hotel is a metro stop so it is easy to get around the rest of Paris, though because of the location we tended to walk everywhere. If you do choose to stay here (and we strongly suggest you do) then you should try the restaurant called 'Pasco' which is on the boulevard de la tour-maubourg (the main street next to the hotel) - it was amazing, the food was really good and the service equally - especially since one of us was vegetarian an unknown concept in Paris!

I spent a week in Paris, one in Italy and one in the mountains at L'Aquila. Of the three hotels, all of which were delightful, Latour Maubourg was the best and most memorable. The three level last century building was completely gutted and remodeled one year ago. An elevator was added and each room totally upgraded but still holding the charm of the past. My room on the third floor faced the park across the street and I opened the long windows for a nice breeze despite the excellent air conditioning. Room #23 was small yet delightful with shades of gold and brown, a little purple, and was well thought out. The new white bathroom has a long and deep bathtub, a room safe, a desk, and best of all a strong WiFi Internet conneciton. There is a intimate rear courtyard, a downstairs dining room and a small but smart lobby. For getting around Paris, the metro station is in the park square across the street and the neighborhood is full of excellent well priced restaurants. Walking toward the Eiffel Tower, there are many hideaway bistros and brasseries and several irresistable pastry shops.

Also, the toilet was in a seperate little room, on the other side of the room, i e, NOT in the bathroom. Not a big deal, but you did have to think about it when you got up in the middle of the night. The linens were very good quality and the staff was very helpful. The elevator quit working the second day we were there and couldn't be fixed, so we hiked up and down three flights of stairs. No problem for us, but I thought I'd mention it. They have a little place in the basement where you can get coffee and pastries in the morning. The hotel, I think, is in a good location.

The room was very large - by most standards, and especially by Paris standards. We had room #1 which we were told was their largest room. Bathroom was a bit small, but shower was great size & really nice - fixtures & fittings completely updated and gorgeous. Decor was spectacular - very parisien. 2 desks, plenty of room for luggage, a lounge settee, a laptop already setup for us and ready with internet access. 2 big closets, extra blankets in the room. beautiful wood floors, big huge windows with gorgeous drapes, HIGH ceilings with original spectacular mouldings, colourful crystal antique chandelier. whole hotel is decorated beautifully - really takes you back in history. I read 1 or 2 reviews that spoke of rude people at this hotel, but I can't imagine who they were referring to! There was always someone at the front desk from morning til late evening who was helpful and very very friendly and so helpful. Great english, although we tried our best to speak French! At night there was someone at the desk that was more of a security person - English wasn't as good, but he was very polite and courteous. If I could have one very small complaint, it would be that our room #1 was situated right at the front door/entrance and was a little noisy at times. BUT it was only \"people/talking\" noise and was only during regular daytime hours. Nighttime was spectacularly quiet in the hotel and the neighbourhood. Probably would have preferred to be on 2nd or 3rd floors, not ground level. Location is spectacular. when we returned to paris a couple of weeks later, we stayed over by the Louvre/Champs Elysees - no comparison. The location of the Hotel Latour Maubourg is MUCH better. close to everything, lots of brasseries and local shops... walking distance to all the tourist hotspots, and a metro stop about 50m away. We walked everywhere from this location. When we stayed in the other hotel near Louvre, we also walked, but had to fight the throngs of tourists, buses, and tourist trap stores. The Invalides area is just a completely different feel, yet arguably more central. Wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again. We heard of other hotels that were cheaper in the same neighbourhood... but can't imagine that they would have had the same feel of luxury and history as this hotel.
