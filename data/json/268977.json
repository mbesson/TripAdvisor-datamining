The staff are really friendly and helpful. The breakfast is basic but there's quite a lot of choice and a waffle maker so you can make your own. There were building works going on next door which were a bit noisy, but not their fault.

This hotel is 40-50s and hasn't seen an infrastructure repair or upgrade since new except for the door card lock. Examples: electrical outlet dangled from the wall; no commode tank top or counter top in bathroom for stuff; tub so old bottom worn thru to core. The building is two story with steep stairs - no elevator. Bottom line: overdue for overhaul ceiling to floor. In any city except Los Angeles, rooms would be $30 a night or less, get a sub par rating or perhaps be out of biz due to failed city inspections. The in-town location is great but it comes with caveats - the office is kept locked at all times and check in procedure requires a copy of drivers license to be kept in the office for police access, according to staff. That was a first for me & I travel a lot. Contrary to other reviews, I found the front desk female both friendly when conversation was the extent of her required involvement and resistant when I required actual assistance. Her unprofessional behavior went far beyond not having a good day. Breakfast was on par with chains offering free food. All that said, if you view the hotel only as a place to drop your bags, sleep and go, the three reasons to stay will work fine; just arrive with expectations in check. I didn't and was stunned.

When we stayed before apologies were made that the room we were staying in was in the process of being redecorated this was OK, however when we stayed this time we were disappointed to find that our room for this stay was in a worse condition than the one we stayed in last time. We were in room 22 which we were given as we had requested a king sized bed with a kitchenette and balcony. We got a comfortable king sized bed (sheets not changed during stay) with an ajoining kitchenette which literally consisted of a coffee maker, fridge, microwave, some cupboards and sink. There was no cutlery or crockery to eat microwaved foods with which was quite inconvenient and frustrating to locate in the local supermarket. The window in the kitchen had nothing to secure it with, not a security issue as we were 3 stories up but it was not attractive at all being very dirty, rusty and held closed by pieces of duct tape on the glass. We did get a balcony, but unlike most of the balconies at the hotel it was not private -it was actually a walkway for other guests to get to their room. This meant it was very noisy through the thin balcony door and we were unable to open all the curtains to let the gorgeous sunlight in, as anyone could have peered in. In fact, for 2 days someone from a neighbouring room that did not have a balcony at all decided to park themselves in front of our window to read a book. There were 2 rooms opposite us and 3 more below, positioned as our room was at an intersection of rooms at the top of a flight of stairs. THe noise at night and in the morning from other families (children mainly running around, shouting) was awful. Doors slamming, shouting, parents telling children off. Add to this the incredibly loud air con... Sorry to say we did not feel safe in our room, as it was at the end of the hotel and our balcony door was accessible to anyone who ventured into the hotel. Had we had a private balcony we would have felt safe as it is not a bad area really, we felt safe walking through it during the day and at night it was just in the hotel that we felt vulnerable. If you stay then make sure you request a private balcony! There were ants in the bathroom which we reported but were not dealt with. The doors in our room had chips out of them and there were stains on the carpet.We had to clean the bathroom before we used it as it was quite dirty. The hotel is situated in a great place, located as it is on Hollywood Boulevard. It is worth noting this is a very busy road and as such very noisy. Not the hotel's fault, but ther it is it is a noisy location with sirens and traffic noise all through the night worse of course at weekends. On our first trip to the hotel the owners were readily available and very helpful, but now the breakfast is at a local cafe and not available form the front reception we did not interact with the owners at all except to check in and out, and they really seemed disinterested in our holiday and our eperience of their hotel. We liked that our bed was made each day (although sheets not changed)and that the hotel offers free parking. We were happy that the hotel was a 40 minute walk from Grauman's Chinese Theatre. We were not happy that the bathroom was not cleaned when the towels were replenished. It was frustrating that the coffee provided for the coffee maker was incostintenty replenished, so some days we could not make coffee.

The room came with a view of the center courtyard from the kitchenette and view of holly hills from the bedroom. The room came with 2 queen beds (semi-hard, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not fussy about bed-softness), a desk, vanity mirror, TV with digital cable, and vanity self adjacent to the bathroom, and dresser. Overall, very decent, quiet, and perfect for a nights rest. The location is on the \"less-than-fancy\" side of Hollywood blvd. Not a horrible area (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from NY originally, so when other people said \"bad neighborhood\" I was expecting a lot worst). The Translayannia restaurant serving the continental breakfast was wonderful! FULL breakfast complete with pancakes, make-your-own waffles, coffee, tea, orange juice, sausage some days, bacon the others, hash browns, eggs, fruit, cottage cheese, and yogurt! ALL FREE! Traveler's tip on getting the most out of your stay -Use the METRO! to LAX: 1hr & 15mins, 3 trains from the hotel, very convenient and cost me less than $3.00! Nearest exit to the hotel is Hollywood and Western, about 3 minute walk from the hotel doorstep. - Buy the StarLine HOP ON HOP OFF tour! The tour travels through: the Westside/Santa Monica/Beaches, Hollywood, Downtown LA, and Universal. -EAT EAT EAT the continental breakfast at Translayennia Restaurant! -Hit Universal CityWalk for nightlife and entertainment!", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDodgy downtowner\u201d", "Author": "teamgraffey", "ReviewID": "UR34383871", "Content": "We arrived at midnight after a long flight and were told our room had been double booked, apparently due to them moving furniture!

However in terms of convenience and price it's fine. My friends and I were looking for a cheap & cheerful place that's close to some of the famous sites of LA. We were not disappointed. There was a secure place for our car (free parking), full complimentary breakfast each morning (in the local restaurant) and a 3min walk from the Metro in which getting to the Walk of Fame, etc is two stops (I hear not many people use the Metro but it was really quite convenient). The owners were nice and friendly and provided us with a lot of information about where to go and what to see. All in all if you're looking for a posh, plush place to rest your head - spend the extra $300 a night and go to the Roosevelt. If you're looking for a place to keep your stuff and a pillow to rest your head on for the night for a price that won't break the bank, then check this place out.

It, like so many old motels across this land, has been bought by a very nice family who is trying to attain the American dream thru lots of hard work. But that being said, it's still an old motel that comes up short in lots of ways. If my wife and I had had one of the great rooms some people talk about here, and if the pool - which is supposed to be it's best feature - were open, and if we just felt like we were experiencing something cool and offbeat rather than rattty, then we could give it a good recommendation. But the bottom line is the place is just not repaired enough. Notice I didn't say maintained enought because that would imply they started with something good and have been trying to keep it up. The place needs structural remodeling that a few planters of flowers hanging from the balcony railings and a clean pool can't overcome. I'll do a 36O degree description of our room. 1) A big hole (fist sized) in wall from the room door handle hitting it filled with a paper cup 2) a leaky aluminum slider window that looked out onto a chair and community ashtry on the walkway which let cigarette smoke into our room, 3) a chair seat cusion with a big old stain on it (flip it over and there was a tear), 4) a built in vanity with a different sized (too small) drawer that looked like an afterthought of an afterthough, 5) a crank handle casement window in the bathroom that could not get the window closed, 6) a shower whose old fixtures had been taken out and replaced with new fixtures, but which left hole in the tile where the previous fixtures had been 7) an inoperative bathroom fan, 8) a toilet that barely flushed 9) a complimentary tray with coffee maker and coffees- with no place to plug the coffee maker in except on the floor, 10) a TV remote that couldn't change the channels, 11) and last but not least - dirty sheets. Believe me, I like 'funky' hotels that have personality. And I can usually overlook some of the deficiencies. And who spends much time in their room when in Hollywood? But this was a big disappointment for us. When they finally do some real structural repair, not just cosmetic 'remodeling', then we may come back. But for now I'd tell people either spend the extra money for a newer/nicer motel, or set your expectations at the 'man this is going to be a great place to have our fraternity bros meet us at' level of vacationing.

The closet doors were falling off and the tile at the bathroom entrance was all broken and crumbling with dirt and dust surrounding the broken tiles. The toilet seat was cracked and there was a big black filthy toilet plunger in the corner. When I opened the drawer next to the bed there was a food and condom wrapper in there! There were inexplicable holes drilled through the top of the large dresser too. The first morning there was no hot water and I had to take a cold shower. The couple on the other side of the wall screamed and cussed at eachother every night and all morning. The coolness of this hotel only goes as far as the googie sign in front, beyond that this motel is a dump. When I got home I felt as though I needed to decontaminate everything that I had brought with me.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cVintage Gem\u201d", "Author": "islewoman", "ReviewID": "UR8116839", "Content": "I stayed here in March with English relations, we had 2 rooms.

Which was my first problem with the surrounding area; I arrived from downtown via the subway and this was my first visit to Hollywood. Well this part of it is not glamorous at all. It looked pretty scary actually and I didn't even know which direction to go. I have to give a local woman a big thank you. She pointed out the direction and got me onto the right bus. Whew. A big plus to this local which was a pleasant surprise. I arrived at the motel and the area was very ghetto looking. I was happy for the liquor store across the street because my nerves were a bit shaken by the gang style looking folks hanging out around the area and needed a drink. Or two. Now to the motel itself. It is pretty seedy - not kept up well, rather noisy window a/c units and a bit of a rank odor to the rooms. More of mold then urine - I could live with that. I did feel that the staff, who were VERY nice to me kept a good eye on the place and I did feel safe. They were also very helpful in pointing out how to get to various places. I slept ok and trusted the staff to keep out any riff raff which they did. And there were no vermin or that kind of thing. But all in all I would probably never stay here again. I would go father to the west where the neighborhood is less frightening looking and probably pay a couple extra dollars as I was here on a short vacation & the room really was not a place to hang out in other then for sleeping. The pool was also not filled but I probably wouldn't have used it anyway. I probably wouldn't have been quite as shook up upon my initial arrival if I had drove up in a car.

There is free covered parking although we didn't have a car. This hotel was a great deal for the price, don't waste more money on a chain because this could be one.
