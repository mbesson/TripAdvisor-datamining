Not at all Western orientated, a very local experience. Please Note this is was not what we were looking for. We only stayed 1 night and then checked out for a more traditional western style hotel, aimed at families with kidsBad pointsVery Expensive for what you get - 110 USD a night, plus 35USD for a childs extra bed for a Laini Room (1 bed + bath)Adjoining via a door to another room and so each adjoining room can hear each other easily, even just talkingSound insulation very poor, planes coming and going, dogs, cars etc etc went on all night, so slept very poorlyPool is very small, Local beaches are not very nice, not clean and there was sewerage being discharged into river nearby. (Albeit it was the wettest rainy season on record)AC hardly strong enough to cool roomLocation is a back alley adjacent to swamp Too many mosquitos around the whole hotel and gardens - not quite their fault as standing water everywhereGood pointsEmployee Service was excellent and free transport to Kuta for Shopping and airport pick upBathroom is very cool and sunken bath niceGreat for a travellers, but seems very expensiveGreat for a relaxing get away from it holiday, with massage on site, but its location is just not conducive to a good holidayWould we ever go back. NO WAY, for what they charged us we could have stayed in Nusa Dua or Kuta in a really nice 4/5 star 'Western style' place with all the usual beach and sports facilities", "Date": "Jan 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551365965", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "IanHay"}, {"Content": "Terrible Unique and Comfort", "Date": "Dec 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR727526513", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "WakaMaya"}, {"Content": "Pity about the beach club A beautiful small resort with individual rooms and bungalows affording a great deal of privacy. Well managed with excellent food. The resort is in a residential area some way from Sanur but the hotel transport will take you there.There is a pool at the hotel but the beach club is something of a disappointment. It is just a local restaurant with loungers and parasols on the beach in Sanur. Fine if that is what you are expecting, but not up to the standards of the hotel. Having said that, they are very friendly and serve good and inexpensive local food. As this is the nearest Waka hotel to the airport it's a good place to unwind for a day or two at the beginning or end of a trip to the other possibly more interestingly placed Waka resorts.", "Date": "Nov 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR222402308", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Charles_Orleans"}, {"Content": "Peaceful Experience...
