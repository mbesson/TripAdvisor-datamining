HOWEVER!!.... The room we got was a standard King room... the bed was extremly weird since it was two twins stuck together, whenever my boyfriend tried to cuddle me, he fell thru the crack. The bathroom was 1 star... no tub, tiny bathroom, only soap given, very uncomfortable shower and towels. NO view whatsoever. No breakfast, no business center, however wireless Internet is free. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone other than people needing a budget clean place... Definitly go to Chapultepec park, and go to the Zona Rosa and Condesa for good bars. Dont go on a tour group to the pyramids, as you can rent a taxivan anywhere for up to 7 people for around $80 USD a day including driver and he will wait for you there!", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oaxaca, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cI always read the reviews but THIS HOTEL made me write my first one\u201d", "Author": "mitzelm", "ReviewID": "UR95617857", "Content": "The only reason I booked this hotel was because it was close to Reforma Ave.,and because it offered breakfast. For the same price I could've booked the Radisson Flamingo. (33 dlls plus 2 kids and taxes 58.60 per night) But i chose this one....BIG MISTAKE. First of all it's one block from reforma...but that street is under constuction so you have to walk around and it can be quite dangerous at night especially with kids. At check-in I asked the receptionist about breakfast and she told me it was from 8-10. So the next day I arrived there and she said they didn't have anything to eat.... She knew all along.....I could tell in her face.... I guess they don't serve breakfast on sundays, but when you make a reservation it doesn't say that. .and they didn't refund the extra I paid for the kids' breakfast. I was furious I asked for the manager but I guess no one works sundays. We had no option but to go to the closest store, grab some milk for the kids and cofee, and on my way back I gave her the receipt(7 dlls) The next day they gave me my $7 but this episode almost ruined my vacation. My family lives in Mexico City told me that for under 50 dlls the best hotel would've been 'El Ejecutivo' on Reforma.

It turns out that the final price on hotels.com is 38 (including tax and fee). After see this, the staff insisted charging me 38 instead of 35, and her argument is that \"You like Internet price, and I am charging you the Internet price\". What's more.

We stayed our last night in Mexico in this terrible hotel as we returned from Acapulco. When we arrived there, the hotel looked very bad even before you enter there. Don't look at the photos in the internet because I think that they were taken when the hotel was new. The hotel was under renovation when we were there. The smell of the paint was very bad. Also the smell of the carpets in the room was very bad, and we found cockroch the room. Also the bathroom smells very bad. Towels were very thin and there was no shampoo in the hotel. Our reservation was for two double rooms and they were not able to fulfill this, so they gave us a triple room and a single room. In addition to that, the staff don't speak a single word in English. We wanted to book a Taxi to go to the airport. The staff didn't understand what we want and they were not able to help us. I went to a close hotel to help me in the Taxi reservation.

There is a little store on Paris and Madrid for little things. There is a ragged old man who hangs around the hotel. He gives good advice and speaks fine English. He is harmless but is a gentleman. There are resturants on Paris that serve decent meals for a decent price. Don't expect breakfast before 9:30. The counter people in the hotel speak some English.

We picked it because we got a good deal online but were a little concerned about being in a \"cheap\" hotel in Mexico City and figured we could just change to another hotel if this one was bad. We ended up staying longer than we had booked for because we liked it so much. It was clean and cute with a nice little cafe in the lobby and Mexican decor. Our junior suite had a basic, but nice little kitchen & living room, and plenty of room for two (separate bedroom which was great, though the layouts differ from room to room). The carpet was brand new in our room and everything was clean. There was plenty of hot water, cable TV, and huge closets (though, oddly, no coathangers). The staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. Our Spanish is dreadful but the staff had a great sense of humor about it and were able to help out with some English (depending on who was behind the front desk at the time). The location is great--very central. The immediate surroundings aren{t that nice (not awful but nothing to write home about) however it is only one block to Reforma (the big main street cutting through the city), a 10 minute walk to the Zona Rosa, and a 20 minute walk to the historic downtown area. If you don{t like to walk, a Metro station is nearby. We found the location ideal. I wasn{t worried about the less than perfect surroundings since it isn{t wise to walk around Mexico City at night anyway (it was fine during the day). Cabs are cheap and can drop you right at the door after dark. The front desk will happily call a taxi for you. I would absolutely recommend this place, especially if you are on a budget and/or you like to have access to kitchen facilities.
