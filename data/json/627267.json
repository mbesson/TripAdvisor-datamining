{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Why Stay Elsewhere? I have to admit that we have stayed at the Royal Pacific for over 25 years when we visit San Francisco. We have always found the location convenient to Little Italy and Chinatown and the added bonus of free parking a fantastic bargain in San Francisco where parking is rediculous.This time we decided to spend a little more money and get a King Room with kitchenette which consisted of a seperate area with wet bar, microwave, and refrigerator.The room was much larger than their standard room and consisted of a King Bed, comfortable convertable couch, 2 nice sitting chairs, a desk chair and writing desk, and a small dining table with 2 chairs. There was plenty of drawer space and a closet between the bedroom and bathroom.The hotel is just finishing extensive remodeling with all rooms refurbished completely. Our room, which I believe is reflective of the remodeling, had new carpet, wall paper paint, new furniture, all new plumbing fixutres, including new sinks, tub/shower, etc.We were very pleased that we spent the extra money to have the convenience of this room which by the way ran $139.00 per night which in San Francisco is a great bargain.I would also like to make a few comments about the owners who I would not by any stretch of the imagination call abrupt. Both greated us in very friendly way and were proud of their remodeling. If you want an absolutely quiet room you might want to think again about staying in downtown San Francisco. Although I prefer quiet at night I have never found it hard to sleep at the Royal Pacific keeping in mind it is right in the center of activities.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR123158861", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nsgw"}, {"Content": "Perfect location in SF!

Their staff may not be too knowledgeable, but they are polite and do their work. There are some \u9225\u6e01dult\u9225?type of business on Broadway (where the hotel is located), but nothing to worry, because a block parallel to Broadway you will find Little Italy, with great ambiance and dining around. Do not let the smell of cigarettes on some of the hotel rooms bother you, they might smell like cigarettes, but you wont get cancer for that (not even if you were to stay there for a whole year, which you wont!) and if you get the smell on yourself, cleanup when you get home, big deal. What\u9225\u6a9a my point? There are some sacrifices when you get a budget hotel, if those little things bother you, be prepare to pay over 180 bucks per night or more elsewhere. I am pretty sure with that price, you won\u9225\u6a9b smell cigarettes around and the people at the front desk will smile at you and drop rose petals at your feet while you walk towards your room. Would I recomend this hotel as a budget one?

Stayed here for only one night. It's a very basic motel with no amenities to speak of, except for free parking which is really why I consider it such a good deal and would return again when visiting either Chinatown or North Beach. Carpet and floral bedspread were in good repair in the balcony room we were assigned. Blankets and sheets were threadbare, pillows were foam rubber with no give, bath towels were small but fairly new. Shower stall was tiled and very clean, water pressure good. Bathroom itself was two very small rooms, with sink outside toilet/shower area. Cable TV was adequate. Security door locks good. Don't stay in front balcony rooms if street noise is an issue.

It's amazing how in the photos the room and hotel look white and clean. Quite opposite of that! We will never stay here again. The girl who checked us in was rude. A few minutes after checking in to our room we found that the toilet would not flush (unfortunately after using it). We called the front desk right away asking for another room since the toilet was obviously broken and was told I call you back later. When we did get the call back she told my husband I get plunger, you come get and try fix. Um, excuse me? Then the motel maintenance guy came and touched the plunger that he was using in the toilet with his bare hands, used our ice bucket and sink, then went in and out of our room twice handling the door knob. I felt sick to my stomach. He said toilet fix, after he left my husband did a test flush and found it was not fixed. We finally were able to get another room, which was a smoker's room and nearly gagged from the smells. Needless to say all our clothes smelt like smoke as well as our hair and everything else. The rooms are grimy, with peeling paint and tile, dirty carpets, old blankets that looked dirty and had holes. This was more like a motel fit for roaches.", "Date": "Mar 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR324760549", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "SnowTravelor"}, {"Content": "Great location, decent hotel Located on the corner of chinatown, 1 block from Northbeach, this hotel is within 15-20 mintues walking distance to many SF staples (Fisherman's Wharf, Ghiradellie Square, Golden Gate Bridge, China Town, North Beach).

It is nothing at all fancy, but the room was in good condition and everything was extremely clean and well maintained. The bed was also good, though the pillows were those cheap foam rubber ones that don't give at all. Minor issue. I felt safe, especially with the three door locks.The location is wonderful, an easy walk to North Beach and Chinatown, and to hundreds of restaurants, bakeries, espresso places, etc. I never touched the cellophane wrapped pastries in my room, choosing to have coffee and breakfast at a nice Italian cafe.I chose a rear facing room but still heard loud industrial ventilation fans from a nearby building. Earplugs are a good idea for sensitive sleepers. Free parking in this part of San Francisco is almost unheard of, and is a great perk included with the room.I don't know where the average rate of $65 comes from, as $95 seems to be the minimum.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR366089963", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MassWineGuy"}, {"Content": "Great Value Location Chinatown.

It is clean and has FREE parking and you can't beat the location. My husband and I have stayed at the Ritz-Carlton and it was wonderful, but we prefer the Royal Pacific for its location and it is so easy to walk anywhere you want to go in the city. My father used to travel to San Francisco quite often on business and always stayed at this hotel. When my family went in June, the kind gentleman at the front desk inquired if we were related to my father and asked about him. We informed the gentleman that he had passed away and he was so kind and had such nice things to say about him. This hotel is not the Ritz or the Four Seasons, but is is oh so much easier on the wallet and frees up more money to enjoy many of the fine dining options SF has to offer. In the immortal words of my late father, when in San Francisco...sleep cheap and eat expensive and that is what we did (and will continue to do)!", "Date": "Jul 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR910098039", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jenabug"}, {"Content": "Great location, and the rooms are fine. This hotel is called a motor inn, and that's exactly what it is. Don't expect any luxuries, but it's perfectly fine. It's in a FANTASTIC location, on the edge of Chinatown and North beach (the Italian quarter) and it's about half way between union square and the Wharf, so you're pretty much walking distance from everything. (but if you want to drive they also have free parking!!!) One warning I might have, is if you're booking with them, you should check what the story is with their air conditioning. There did seem to be one in the room, but it wasn't on. I have a feeling it's just cos you have to pay extra, but if you're there in the summer it would be quite important so check it out in advance. We were there late September so it didn't matter.Overall this place is absolutely fine. If you're fussy, go stay in a fancy schmancy hotel, but if you want a great location for a very reasonable price, stay here.
