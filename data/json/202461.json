It is located in a quiet residential area, close to a park, close to a supermarket (where you can buy food to cook in the well-equipped mini-kitchen). Rooms are comfortable, very clean, and so is the bathroom. On the fridge there is water offered for free. Internet access is free for one hour per day, though I had trouble making it work in my iPhone. The only drawback: the car parking garage is too narrow, and requires some tricky maneuvering when full. The parking spots themselves are of good size, but they have those movable rails for extra cars to be parked over, which means you might have to shift them around.

Although it is not particularly beautiful it doesn't fall short in any sense.

The only thing against it is that it is a little bit far from the center of the action, the tram ride is not very long, but it can get packed at times. The real draw back is that the tram stop is 4 longggg blocks away from the hotel in a very quiet residential neighborhood, so once you go back to the hotel it is really hard to muster the evergy to go back out again, (unless you take a cab). So if you are party people this is not in any sense close to ANYTHING at night. If you are the hard core tourist who leaves at 10 AM and returns after a meal in the city this hotel is really good value for money.

The hotel is really nice as it is really close top the Weisensee. The reception was specious with a small bar that opened at odd times, there's also a beer garden. The room was big and spacious with quite luxurious finishings. The bathroom was nice and there's a tiny galley kitchen which is very useful. Note there's a cheap supermarket on the street corner.

There's a biergarten and a playground for kids less than a hundred feet from the hotel. There's also a small grocery about 3 minutes walk away. I would stay here again definitely, but there were some slight drawbacks. The parking costs 10 euros a night in their underground parking garage. You can park for free on the street, but I could not tell if the neighborhood was \"safe\" judging from the numerous buildings covered in graffiti. (Come to find out the entire city is covered in graffiti). The restaurant on site \"snubbed\" me and my family. Reason - more upscale, or so it thinks, so probably didn't take kind to the t-shirts and shorts. At first I was put off but there's a friendly and good German restaurant about a minute's walk away. Finally, if you've never been to Berlin before (first visit) - Weissensee is farther than you think. 5 minutes walk to tram, 15 minutes tram to Alexanderplatz, 20 minutes train to Zoo Berlin.

The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. Internet access is only available in the lobby from one computer or, if you bring a laptop, via a wireless card that you have to provide. The location is not ultra central but in the quiet, residential district of Weissensee (White Lake) in the Eastern part of Berlin. Getting to the city center (Mitte) takes 15-20 minutes by car or a bit longer by public transport. The next tram stop towards the center is about an eight-minute walk away. But Berlin is a driving town anyway, and we never go there without renting a (small!) car. The only thing that we didn't like was that there was just 1 pillow per person, and they were very thin/flat. At our request, they brought more pillows. Also there are no irons in the rooms.
