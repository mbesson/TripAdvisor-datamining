The location is ideal, just a short walk away from all the shopping and restaurants and the hotel itself is located on a street that is quiet and even guarded (as it is on the same street as the Italian Consulate). The rooms at TomTom are stylish, spacious and impeccably clean. The bathrooms are especially welcoming, with luxurious fittings and top-notch toiletries. The beds are heavenly and there is a free wireless internet in all the rooms. However, it is the service that makes TomTom such a lovely place to stay. Being a small boutique hotel, they offer a great level of attention and hospitality to every guest. Especially Nural is always so welcoming and has an infectious enthusiasm and smile for all TomTom customers. Our use of room service has always been good. The breakfast is both fresh and plentiful, especially as you can order your favoured egg dishes \u00c3\u00a0 la carte. The view from the breakfast room on the top floor terrace is pleasant and you can enjoy nice cocktails (not cheap!) or dinner there in the evenings at well.

I'll just add some additional comments to the mix. My husband and I stayed here for six nights in early March. I loved the room's minimalist decor, with wooden furniture and floors offset by Ottoman accents. The heated tile floors in the bathroom were a welcome feature after long days exploring in the chilly rain. Good water pressure from the shower (an important detail for us). The Wi-Fi was free and fast, a rarity in most hotels. The Turkish delights at turndown were delish. Our rate included a free airport transfer -- which was a breeze from start to finish -- as well as free breakfast and dinner at the rooftop restaurant. The breakfast offerings were basic, with solid service and stunning views across the Golden Horn. The dinner was enjoyable -- a modern twist on traditional Ottoman fare -- but portions were on the small side. There have been many opinions about the surrounding neighborhood. The hotel may seem off the beaten path, but it's only 5 minutes downhill to a nearby tram stop (Tophane). And Istikal, the major pedestrian boulevard, is 5-10 minutes the other direction -- albeit up a steep hill. But hills are just the reality on this side of the Horn. If you're staying for only a few days in Istanbul, you might be better served with a hotel near the historic sights. But we spent the majority of our trip in Beyoglu, which offered more in terms of great restaurants, bars and shopping. It's easy enough to zip over to Topkapi and Hagia Sophia on the nearby tram. (We even took the tram to the airport at the end of our journey -- a straightforward process.) We both agreed that it was one of the best hotels we've stayed in during our travels. For a drink near the hotel, I'd recommend the Solera Winery, which offered a wide selection of local wines by the glass.

We have visited Istanbul numerous times, and it is easily one of our favorite cities in the world because of its beautiful setting, delicious cuisine, amazingly rich art, history, and architecture. Previously, we have stayed in other hotels, to include both Four Seasons properties, but this time, at the suggestion of our travel agent, we decided to try a smaller hotel with a boutique feel. The Tom Tom is a nice hotel in the stylish Galata District, and we did enjoy our stay there, with a few caveats. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is on the Bosphorus side and it is a little out of the way. This is both good and bad. The good side of the location is that it is relatively close to Istiklal Caddesi (which is open until late into the evenings), the Museum of Modern Art and it is also not too far from a convenient tram stop, which makes it easy to get to all the sites. It is also positioned on the same street as the Italian Embassy, so there is security (literally) on the street itself in the form of an armed guard and a traffic control point. On the down side, this location is not the best in town in terms of neighborhood. It is not a dangerous neighborhood, but it is not going to win any awards for luxury dwellings. It is also smack dab in the center of a very large and steep hill, which although it gives you a superb view of the Bosphorus, it means you have a pretty hefty climb to either get to places you want to go or to get back to the hotel if you are walking. Of note, due to its position, it does take a good 20-30 minutes to get to Old Town where all of the must-see destinations are to include the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia, the Grand Bazaar, the Cistern, etc. We would recommend this neighborhood for people with either more than a few days in Istanbul, or those interested in the various museums this side of the strait. The hotel itself is stylish with a contemporary and modern feel. Good use of color and glass make the hotel feel spacious and open. There is tasteful, local Turkish art and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is well done. The rooms are equally refined. We had a very comfortable king bed suite with a gigantic floor-to-ceiling marble bathroom that included a double vanity. There was a wonderful couch and table in the adjacent sitting room, which is always helpful in order to spread out your things in the midst of a long trip abroad. The room included wifi and, although it was a bit slow, it was nice to have the feature. The bathroom toiletries and room amenities were very fitting for a hotel of this caliber, and in addition there is a complimentary coffee station with bottled water. We enjoyed the room and had no complaints. The restaurant and breakfast were also very good. We were greeted warmly each morning and asked if we wanted to order an omelet or anything else cooked to order. During breakfast, you are treated to the use of a complimentary iPad with internet access \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice touch that allows you browse the morning news as you see fit and surf the web to check on your events for the day. The continental buffet was well done with attentive service, and we enjoyed all the food very much. Our single biggest complaint about the hotel was the concierge service. Apparently, the normal concierge was away or had quit or\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not exactly sure what happened to him, but the upshot is that the staff that were available were not very good at providing directions or recommended places to eat. We use concierge services heavily during our stays \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in Istanbul where you need someone with insider knowledge to give current suggestions, make appointments, and generally be available while you are out and about to make changes, if necessary. Istanbul is a fascinating city and similar to any other town known for its art and entertainment scene, things change quickly enough that guidebooks often aren't up to date, making the trusted concierge our go to person in many situations. The hotel staff did not know enough about the services and restaurants in town and often guided us to questionable areas or restaurants that did not meet our expectations. Generally, we believe good concierge service is absolutely integral to a 5-Star experience, so we deducted a star from the Tom Tom for this shortfall. Other than that one gripe, the Tom Tom is a well-run hotel. We will probably not return to the Tom Tom due to its location (it was nice to stay there once, but we would choose a different part of the city next time), but we do recommend the hotel if you are looking to stay in the part of the city.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holden Beach, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201c\"Younique Service\"\u201d", "Author": "Cricketnc", "ReviewID": "UR121367240", "Content": "My mother and I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel on Oct. 26.

We also had a nice time at 360 Istanbul. Negatives: As mentioned previously, the service was just okay. Our trip began inauspiciously with a major flight problem with United airlines. Our flight out of Chicago was delayed due to mechanical problem. While the mechanics worked on the plane, the United computer system crashed world-wide, grounding all international flights. Then it was impossible to get re-booked in a timely manner. We were lucky to get out just a day and half late on Turkish airlines, however our luggage was not re-routed as promised and we went for days in Istanbul without our luggage. Obviously, we arrived at the hotel a day later than planned. We had notified the hotel that our flight was canceled and that we would be arriving a day late. Our sisters had been scheduled to arrive the day after we had planned to arrive. When we arrived at the hotel, we were not offered any assistance in terms of the lost luggage. We had reported the luggage as lost upon arrival and were told to call back the next day. We suggested that the hotel might call for us, given there was a significant language barrier when trying to communicate with Turkish airlines, and the staff reluctantly agreed. Our luggage finally arrived (mine on the third day, my husband's on the fourth day). The hotel did offer us a complimentary bottle of champagne for our trouble, which was most appreciated. Then, upon checkout with a taxi waiting to take us to the airport, we had a major issue. We were charged for the first night when our flight was canceled, as we expected, per hotel policy. However, the hotel insisted that our sisters also arrived a day late. I explained that the sisters had always been scheduled to arrive a day later than us. Even when we were able to pull up an email I had sent to them on the Tomtom's own computer clearly stating the arrival and departure dates for both of our suites, the hotel insisted this was incorrect!!!!!! I had received an email response from Tomtom confirming the correct dates a few days before we left, but unfortunately had not printed it. The hotel could not locate that email confirmation. It took us 30 minutes to check out and ultimately the gentleman at the desk called someone and got approval to drop the extra night from our sister's bill. We had a flight to catch and the whole thing was most disturbing. When I got back to the states, I located the email confirmation from theTomtom and sent it to the hotel indicating how distressing it was to have had to go through an argument when the hotel had clearly confirmed our dates. I did receive an apology from the hotel manager. The fact that the gentleman on check out would not honor the dates in the email from me that he could see in his computer before his very eyes is appalling to me. Why he spent 30 minutes before he called someone is also surprising, when he knew we had a flight to catch. The other negative, although minor, is the morning noise from the school children coming to school in the courtyard. Our room looked down on the courtyard of the hotel entrance and we were awakened each morning between 7:30 and 8:00 by the high-pitched laughter and screaming of elementary school children coming to school. The noise really carries in the courtyard. Not a big deal, unless you like to sleep in. If so, you may want a room that does not look onto the courtyard. Overall, I don't think I would stay there again, given all the options in Istanbul, unless I was certain that Tomtom had raised the bar in terms of service.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cIncredible, highly recommend\u201d", "Author": "traveltheworld032", "ReviewID": "UR114746087", "Content": "A small inn, and definitely hard to find, this place is a gem.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. We did not speak Turkish, so we appreciated the staff's excellent command of English. The location was a short walk to the main shopping and dining part of Taksim. We felt safe taking that walk in the evening, though we probably would have felt less comfortable if we had been walking alone. The neighborhood is not bad, it is just empty at night because it is more residential than commercial. We saw this as a positive thing because the neighborhood is quiet, unlike noisy Taksim just a few blocks away. In the mornings as we ate breakfast, we looked out the windows and saw many local children walking up the hill to school, accompanied by their parents. After each day of sightseeing, we wandered around Taksim and found enjoyable restaurants and shops. Our accommodations at Tomtom had only one drawback - the only place to store clothes was in one closet that also had a few shelves. There was no piece of furniture with drawers. If a guest were only staying for one or two nights there would be no problem, We had been travelling for 10 days and had a lot of clothes with us. We kept our clothes in our suitcases. The storage situation was not a big issue for us because everything else was so nice. The closet area also included a safe and a refrigerator. Every evening the staff brought us lovely little Turkish candies, and bottled water was provided in the room, free of charge.

Overall, this is a very comfortable, spacious and stylish hotel. Our suite was very clean with little to no wear. Bed was comfortable, although a bit hard for my preference. A selection of bed pillows are provided. The all marble bathroom was gorgeous, complete with a Philippe Starck whirlpool tub, 2 sinks, and a separate shower. Beautiful wood floors, attractive art work, lamps and decorations rounded out the remainder of the suite. Given the above, I can recommend TomTom suites. However, the following should be noted: 1) Hotel is located in the Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu district of Istanbul. If you are only coming to Istanbul only for a few days, most of the major tourist sites are located on the other side of the Golden Horn (ie - Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace). It would be about a 30 min walk or so. There is a taxi rank just up the street, and a cab ride is less than 10 TL. The problem seems to be getting back as even taxis with meters seem to charge several times as much on the other side of the Golden Horn. Most taxi drivers do not know the city well, and even providing them with a map some dropped us off several blocks from the hotel. 2) The Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu district is fairly hilly. There is a very steep hill from the Hotel up to the main street. 3) There are few recommended restaurants in the area. If you review the top restaurants in Trip Advisor, they are mostly all located on the other side of the Golden Horn. 4) The Hotel appears to have recently changed their in house restaurant. The \"Bistro\" as indicated on their website appeared to be all but closed. The Terrace Bar upstairs has been changed to a modern/contemporary restaurant. We ate there once, and the food was decent, but the portions were small. After a long day exploring Istanbul, this wouldn't be my first choice for a filling meal. The Hotel needs a more accessible restaurant. 5) Room service is poor. Menu is extremely limited - caesar salad, hamburgers, and a few other items. We called room service one night and asked what the hamburger came with and was told that it didn't come with anything. When it was delivered, it came with fries. Also, we asked if anything could be ordered that was not on the room service menu - we were told if we wanted something else to come to the restaurant. That would defeat the purpose of room service! Other hotels such as the W will gladly accommodate such requests. 6) Breakfast Buffet is extremely limited. Although they can make eggs, omelets on request, there are no other hot items. Mostly cereal, bread, some cheese and cold cuts. 7) Area directly around hotel is run down. There is an empty lot next door. Next to that there are a series of abandoned buildings, some with collapsed roofs etc. Not sure how safe the area is or not, but the front desk told us not to carry much cash with us when we go out! (although this is sound advice for any large city, it is not exactly reassuring for the hotel to mention this to you as soon as you check in). 8) The street the Hotel is on is blocked by security for the Italian embassy, so you can't catch a cab outside the hotel and cab drivers can't drop you off out front. 9) There is a school located right across the street that I believe is associated with the Italian embassy there. Every morning around 7:30 to 8am the area outside turns into a school yard with children yelling. It didn't bother me personally, but if you are a light sleeper this could be an issue. 10) I would say generally hotel staff seemed friendly. However, they do need additional training. The front desk had recommended a local historic hamam and even provided a brochure. The brochure gave the impression that it was high end but it turned out to be anything but. The women hamam attendants were old, rude and continually yelled at my wife in Turkish. The attendant rubbed my wife's neck so hard she experienced a large abrasive cut. When we brought this to the attention of the front desk at checkout, no apology was offered. After reading the reviews about this hamam on trip advisor (wish we had done so before my wife went!), it is rated extremely poorly. It doesn't seem like the hotel vets any of their recommendations.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "michaelandro", "ReviewID": "UR95152579", "Content": "TomTom Suites was the perfect choice for our honeymoon trip to Istanbul.

TomTom Suites is exceptional. All the staffs have been so polite and helpful all the time, foods were great. We are rarely impressed by hotels, but, this time - the hotel made our trip so much more memorable. The Turkish hospitality is none to second, at least at TomTom. There's independence street, about 5 mins of walk from the hotel up the hill - it was great to hang out there until midnight, filled with young crowd and lots of artists. So much energy is there. We went there every night - many good restaurants, shops, and bars, and desert places! There are two ways to go up the hill to independence street, and one is much shorter! However, at night, there's not much lighting, so not encouraged to walk although I found no trouble personally. Maybe taking a short walk during day time, and taking a longer route (with lighting) during night time is a good idea. To the old historic area, you can walk down hill about 5 mins, and there's tram, you can take it and cross the bridge easily and comeback same way. It was very easy. I actually stayed another 3 nights in old area, and kind of regretted my decision. The quality and service of the hotel over there, which was just about 30$ cheaper than TomTom was not to be compared in any positive way to TomTom. Hotel foods are not cheap, but I found quality there. At the time of my visit, they were offering some discount for hotel residents, and I ate about every two days, and was happy with it. Liquors are not cheap, but there's good view. Breakfast was excellent! All the waiters were extremely helpful and kind. The only concern was safety issue. It's at the top of the building, and my 2 year old wanted to go to the edge of the balcony where there were no shields - that kind of made me feel a bit concerned whenever I was there. For adults, this safety issue does not apply at all unless you're uncontrallably drunken :) This hotel is very calm. This is because it's about 5 min walk from busy streets, and it's across Italian consulate. It looks a bit separated from real world, but I found it very nice. Overall, TomTom has been great. After my Istanbul stay, I stayed in Santorini, Crete, and Athens for another 2 weeks, and always missed my stay in TomTom. I'm sure I'll make another visit to TomTom, and I'm recommending this place to all my friends and colleagues. The longer you stay, the longer you're likely to miss it - very good very luxurious, hard to beat for what you pay. My wife almost cried when she was leaving.... Only missing thing will be swimming pool. If you're very serious about it, that may be the only reason not to stay at TomTom.

This caring service was repeated throughout our stay and all our requests were met with smiles and were promptly attended. The concierge made excellent suggestions for meals, both at fancy restaurants and simple ones. The room was wonderful- very light and airy, comfortable, large, and everything was in pristine order. The bathroom was fabulous and Molton Brown toiletries, thick towels, all sorts of thoughtful extras for men and women made bathing a real pleasure.

Over-sized bathrooms, high ceilings, everything one could hope for. A true showcase of modern art and lots of space. As well, front staff were extremely helpful, providing maps and information on everything we asked. However... there were some problems with service staff. We could only book a standard room for the first of three nights but were told via e-mail (weeks earlier) that they will have a junior suite for us (at a higher rate of course). Well, it didn't quite work out that way. The cheaper standard room on the 3rd floor was actually nicer than the junior suite. Though the jr.suite is described as having a 'garden view' from the 3rd floor, we ended up on the first floor, looking at rows of barbed wire that belonged to the Italian consulate across the street. Not what we had expected from a superior category. In fairness, upon checkout they did adjust the invoice and we were not charged the additional cost of the 'suite' (though we would have much preferred if they had honored the confirmation of our original booking and provided us with the room we were told we will get). The view from the small terrace restaurant is fabulous. Drinks and food are expensive, but reasonably good. Make sure to order the 'meze' for a starter. Menus is quite limited. Serving staff are unsure about what they are doing and would benefit from additional training. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but we didn't see anyone smiling. They seemed quite tense. (Except one young server at breakfast who had a sense of humor). There are better restaurants for the money, but it's convenient to dine in after a day of sightseeing. Airport transfer is included, but there was a glitch. The bell-man placed our luggage in a taxi he had called and we drove off, the meter running. After a few minutes I asked the driver why the meter was on and though he did not speak English we gathered there was no complimentary fare. I asked him to drive us back to the hotel where the designated van was waiting for us, not knowing we had left via taxi. Just another example of the staff not quite knowing what is going in.

Also they have a taxi company that they use and book for the guests which removes the normal bartering/blagging process whenever you hail a cab on the street.

Hotel is only a 10 minute taxi ride (at $10) from Sultanahmet or can hop on subway. Much safer than staying in Sultanahmet as far as I'm concerned. The beautiful and quiet Italian Consulate is right across the street and consequently access to the street is limited by 24 hour security guards who control street barriers.

We always prefer smaller boutique places that are well designed and in actual neighborhoods vs. larger impersonal luxury hotels. TomTom didn't dissapoint! As previously mentioned, beautifully designed and furnished rooms, the best toiletries, etc. The roof deck is very nice with a great view. The location is amazing, in-between everywhere that you want to go but far enough away from the touristy madness. I'd argue it's one of the best situated hotels in Istanbul. As mentioned, it's a very steep but quick walk up to the main street of Isklal. However, this can be challenging if you have any mobility issues. In general, the area is rather hilly but so is most of Istanbul. In the other direction, you can walk up into a neighborhood renowned for antiques and nice cafes or down to the tram that takes you to the main tourist attractions or the road to get to Ortokoy or Bebek. At no point does it feel like you are in the \"tourist district\" but you never feel unwelcome or out of place. As for noise, we found the building itself to be quiet and well insulated. You didn't hear noise from the rooms around you and minimal noise from the room above. Nowhere near as bad as what an earlier reviewer described. The only real noise to speak of does come from the kids in the morning and the afternoon who walk on the dead-end road to and from school. Other than this, and some kids playing soccer on occasion, the street outside of the hotel is pretty quiet Breakfast in the morning is great. Freshly baked pastries (done at the hotel) and fruit, cheeses and meats, served by extremely friendly staff. Fuat in particular is a delight to interact with and was extremely helpful. The staff overall is very friendly and accommodating. Everyone at the front desk regardless of time of day did whatever they could to make sure we were receiving the best service possible. There are however a few things that need improvement to make the hotel even better. -While breakfast is excellent, we were less than impressed with dinner. To the point that we ate there once and did not choose to repeat the experience. The service was good but the quality of the food and the cooking was pretty bad esp. considering the prices of the food vs. what can be had in the neighborhood for much less. We are admitted foodies, but we didn't hold the hotel restaurant up to lofty expectations. This needs to be addressed. -While the staff is very friendly and eager to help, the hotel would benefit from a dedicated concierge or someone who really knows about the various restaurants around the city. With a hotel of this caliber, we expected them to be more informed about different places and to let us know how traffic can affect getting there, etc. If you didn't ask them these kinds of questions, it didn't occur to them to tell you. -Lastly, with the windows closed in the room there is zero airflow without having the heat on and it's extremely dry. I understand them not wanting to run the AC unless the temperature warrants, but there should be a way to circulate air without opening the windows in the spring (see my earlier comment about noise from school kids in the morning).

The first night we arrived we were treated to a glass of wine by Alli, the Guest Relations Manager, and saw for the first time the beautiful view of Hagia Sofia and the Blue Mosque from the roof top bar and restaurant of the hotel. I always get out there and eat the local food and rarely take more than one evening meal in a hotel while I visit, but my friend and I ate at the restaurant on the top floor 3 nights of the 5 nights we stayed. I don't know what happened! We felt comfortable, enjoyed the staff and the view, and the food was good, so after a day of touring sites and being exhausted, it was one place were we just wanted to stay put. The breakfast in the morning was very nice and the tour company that the hotel recommends was very good. We did two private tours with this company (can't spell the name but it's the main one the hotel uses) and we were very happy with both tours. Suzanne was our guide and we can highly recommend her if you choose to ask for her. The location of the hotel is unique in that it is by the Italian Embassy and Russian Embassy so there is a guard at the top of the street and the street itself is quiet. This is a real bonus as Istanbul can be noisy and in this location it was like the craziness was just up the street buy not on our street. I liked Istanbul and wished I had more time. I generally pick a different hotel the second time around but in this case I would want to go back to my \"home\" in Istanbul again because that is how I felt while I was there.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort McMurray, AB, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel experience, a real gem!\u201d", "Author": "12FootDavis", "ReviewID": "UR61278023", "Content": "Istanbul was a big trip for us. Coming from western Canada and travelling 18 hours by plane, we wanted a hotel with good service, nice amenities, comfortable bed and bath, and that was near to the action of Instanbul. We stumbled across TomTom suites online, and took a chance with it...and are we ever happy we did! Although the map to the hotel confused all taxi drivers (I learned that saying Galatasaray would get you close), when we found it we were blown away. Fine old wood floors, marble staircase, excellent fit and finish, spotlessly clean everywhere...and this was only on the way to the room. Once in the room, we entered our large L shaped junior suite. Beautiful! Three large double windows that opened onto a quiet residential/private street facing the Italian consulate. Beautiful king sized bed with top quality bedding. 12 foot ceilings with crown moulding, handsome artwork, quality wood furniture and flat screen TV/DVD/Sat. How could they top it? Upon entering the floor to ceiling marble clad HUGE bathroom...I found out. Top quality fixtures, double sink, rainstorm shower head, double soaker jacuzzi tub, fine soaps and shampoos, etc. Did I mention that this was the JUNIOR SUITE? Complimentary welcome drink served on the Terrace bar roof was the next suprise...a STUNNING view of the Bosphorous/Golden horn with the Aya Sophia/Blue Mosque/Topaki Palace right there! The breakfast served from 7-1030 was spectacular. Fresh eggs on demand, squeezed OJ, choice of coffee, fresh pasteries, warm breads, olives, salad, fruits, cheeses, meats, etc. It was excellent everyday. Dinner in the restaurant was equally as good. The food is fresh and tasty, reasonably priced, and different enough from the typical Turkish meals in Beyoglu to make it a welcome treat. Nice wine list as well! The location was as good as it gets. A 5 minute walk (uphill) to Istiklal street and the endless shops, bars, and restaurants. A 5 minute walk (downhill) gets you to the train station that transports you to Sultanahmet and the Grand Bazaar/Blue Mosque in 15 minutes. Galata tower, Galatasaray Hamam, Taksim Square are all within walking distance. But when you are done with the crowds, your return to the oasis that is the TomTom Suites for a mid-afternoon siesta is one of the special pleasures that is so nice to find on a vacation. The staff was polite, multi-lingual, efficient and friendly.

We wanted a quiet location in Istanbul and this hotel is more than perfect. Located near busy Istiklal street for shopping and restaurants, with easy reach to the tramway stop going to Sultanahmet in 5 minutes. The hotel is surrounded by embassies (Itally, Russia, France) and is very safe. We also loved the mixing contrast with the beautiful, lively popular life in the surrounding the area. It is not dirty neither rundown, it is just life as we lost in many hygienist western cities... During the day, you just hear for very few minutes children going to school and playing. This is absolutely not noise, just manifestation of life. Tomtom suites is very QUIET and it is really a peaceful, relaxing hotel where you can pamper and sooth yourself from hectic Istanbul activities. We were in executive suite and it is really an AMAZING suite : very large, king size comfy bed, 2 big flat TVs, large marble bathroom with big jacuzzi bathtub, living room with kitchenette, lots of stowage. Top of the top is the terrace, as big as the suite, with magnificent views on the Bosphorus and Sultanahamet. We loved to go early in Sultanahmet to visit turistic places than coming back at noon at the hotel to have sunbathing on the terrace and then going out again for shopping and eating + night life. We particularly loved the design of the hotel : contemporary beautiful and chic wooden furniture, beige fabrics, wooden and marble floors. It is has no flashy nor kitsch furniture you could find in many bad design hotels. Very feng shui and chic atmosphere. Staff is brilliant : very serviceable, professional staff, never intrusive. Thanks to Ali Dogan and his assistant working in the morning, a wonderful and very helpful woman. Breakfast is very good. Terrace bar-restaurant has nice atmosphere and beathtaking views. The only minus is the random turndown service. For this category of hotel we could expect a regular turndown service with bottles of water each night. Internet connection is also very slow.

The hotel is wonderfully located, though the first night coming late from the airport we were a little worried as its nestled right in the middle of the old neighborhood of Beyoglu. The Rooms: Very large, very well appointed, very clean with lots of extra little details -- very full minibar, provided with the choice of local wines (we didn't but it was nice to see), beautiful carpets and lots of space. The hotel is a renovated convent so the bones of the place are great, the owner redid it in a modern style, which can sometimes mean poor details and bad construction, but not in this case. The whole place is beautifully renovated. Also I think the artwork is original and mostly of turkish artists, its very nice. Beds were incredibly comfortable with big pillows. Our bathroom had both a HUGE bathtup and a shower, with a very wide selection of soaps. When was the last time you stayed at hotel and you could choose between 3 different types of soap which are rotated daily so you have 3 different choices every day? Internet connection is a little slow at first but I think thats more a function of the Turkish states control on communication than the hotel's fault (it was interesting to see which sites were blocked or not). We had a room on the 3 floor overlooking the Italian consulates residency and the golden horn. The hotel doesn' t have what I imagine are the amazing views of the Bosphorus of the hotels on the water, but it doesn't need them either. The staff was beyond courteous. they were charming.

I've been waxling lyrical about the whole trip since we got but but do make special mention of Tom Tom. Since coming back we've heard from people, we were unaware of before we left, that have apartments in Istanbul which are now being offered on our next, inevitable, trip. In all seriousness we will decline as there are few places I've felt quite so at home in - the decore being similar to what we have at home. I have to make special mention regarding the staff. Rarely have I come across sweeter, more friendly and deferential people - always on hand to assist or freshen my glass - a real winner for me.

Our room was light and airy with 14 foot ceilings and three large picture windows. The room was decorated simply but very elegantly and featured handwoven rugs and handmade local pottery and original contemporary oil paintings of Istanbul sites. Our large and luxurious carrera marble bathroom had heated floors and a separate (large) rainhead shower and 6 foot jetted tub. Double sinks and large mirrors finished the room. Fixtures were Hans Grohe and Duravit. We had our choice of 4 types of soap (Olive Oil, Thyme, Daphne, Cinnamon) and a selection of pillow choices.

In the hallway, we had an oversized closet with a safe, stocked minibar, complimentary coffee setups and bottled water. The room included umbrellas (not needed), shoe horn and cloth laundry bags. We enjoyed a complimentary breakfast with Salmon, fresh cheeses, homemade breads, fruit, jam and cereals. The library had many terrific books about Istanbul, Turkey and we especially enjoyed the history books that helped educate us on the environs. What we most enjoyed about this hotel was the staffs' warm welcome and quest to provide support for every need. They were charming, knowledgable and fun to be with. In terms of location, it is very close to the metro stop (by walking down the hill) and we never had any trouble getting a cab within about 5 minutes of calling one. The climb back to the hotel (uphill) is not for everyone. I recommend this for moderately fit couples who want luxury but also the opportunity to be in a neighborhood that is quiet, safe and real.
