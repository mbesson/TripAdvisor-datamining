{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved the Stanza Mare Coral Comfort!! We've just spent the last month at the Stanza Mare in Punta Cana. I really can't say enough about how positive our experience has been. Check-in went smoothly with our requests for a room with a view being accomodated. The grounds were immaculate with a beautiful pool and poolside restaurant/bar. Our room was a 2bedroom 2bathroom, with a fully stocked kitchen. It had all the comforts of home while still offering the luxury of a 'resort feeling'. The condos are situated on the most beautiful stretch of beach we've ever seen. It really is just like the pictures show. No photo touchups here! Because it is a smaller resort there are no issues with reserving beach or pool chairs, there are plenty for everyone. Staff members truly went beyond the expected, doing anything to make our trip more enjoyable. Even opening up the mini-market after hours for my daughter so she could buy some coke. The manager, Emanuel was readily available to assist with any need that arose. Personally checking in on us the 1st evening to be sure the apartment was up to standards and not lacking anything. Our request for ice trays was filled immediately. If you are looking for a vacation experience different from your overcrowded all-inclusive, the Stanza Mare is for you. We will definitely be back and would recommend this accomodation to anyone.", "Date": "Dec 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR197167396", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MikVancouver"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147293-d1199732-r23087374-Stanza_Mare_Coral_Comfort-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html", "HotelID": "1199732", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
