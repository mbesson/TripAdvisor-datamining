It is within a close (less than 5 minute walk) from the center. I stayed here recently on a visit to Boston with a friend. My room was on the 6th floor, and faced Merrimack Street/large parking garage. The pros: Handy location (three minute walk to TD Center, 5 or 10 minute walk to North Station, and North Station T stop-very easy to get to even if you take a train and walk with luggage). The staff is very friendly, and willing to help. The cons: My room was a standard king on the 6th floor, and although it was clean, it had some dated features and was small (think a bit larger than a standard hotel room in London). The walls are quite thin, as the building itself is old. The Hotel's website is a bit deceiving, and does not really show clear pictures of its amenities. I did not use any of the amenities, nor did I visit its lounge/restaurant, so I cannot comment on those. Overall, I my general feeling is that this is a good choice if you are venturing into Boston for an event at TD Garden, and are just looking for a place that is not over the top.

But, in this case must let you know what you are in for: Made reservations several months ahead, planning a nice get away for my husband and I. We called several weeks ahead to let Bullfinch know we would be arriving late, to ensure our room and check in would be open. They said no problem. Upon check-in, person behind the counter literally said \"phew, we have a room left\". I responded with \"was that a concern?\". He says \"yes, sometimes we run out\". So -- if you want to be SURE you have a room, this isn't the place for you. There is no priority on what room you are given based on reservation.. whoever shows up first gets the nicest room. Come on a later flight, you might be hosed. After a little lecture about occupy wall street and how nice the registrant thought it would be to be part of \"the 1%\", we were given the room keys. We were given the room right by the elevator. The view was better with the curtains closed. Loud NOISE from the elevator humming up and down, and a few noisy hotel guests all through the night.

But made the best of it and wrapped it in the blanket, called it a night. If you stay here over the weekend, this is a commercial area and nothing is really open. The area is a little dark and scarey with lots of alleys and back corners. Nothing open in the area for breakfast weekends. Monday morning it was a happy place to be.. Again, upon checkout, told the staff about the noisy room, and the items mentioned above. The answer was \"oh\". We asked again about our early registration, how we ended up with the noisy elevator room, and were promptly shuffled on out the door. \"Byeee!\" On a positive note, check out the new balance bike service all over town, rent the bikes and ride around the Charles River, it was the highlight of our trip!

This is not your typical cookie cutter hotel with the standardized rooms but rather due to the type of building and the restoration of it, most of the rooms have little in common, based upon viewing the fire escape floorplans.

We took the Blue line in from the airport and used the T to hit some of the outer parts of the city. The North End, Seaport, Beacon Hill, Quincy Market are all within walking distance. I was keeping this weekend celebration in line with an Italian flare as the North End is filled with many typical Italian restaurants. I choose to dine at two that are not so typical but rather very romantic and cozy. Marco on Hanover, and Carmen on North Street. Both are small, cozy, very romantic, and not main stream. I did not have the opportunity to dine at the hotel restaurant but it seemed to be a nice place. The area is filled with various sports bars as the TD center is a few blocks away.

I have never been to the northeast before. Last Thursday, I flew into Boston, got into a leased car and drove to Vermont for a wedding. I returned to Boston Sunday night before my flight out on Monday. A friend (well, the bride actually) recommended the Bullfinch Hotel. Being my first trip, I knew nothing about where to be or where to stay so I took her advice. I simply loved this hotel! Your front desk people when I checked in were so helpful and accommodating. The room was spotless and attractive. I even had a view of a part of the Boston skyline! But, the best thing of all was how the staff and the manager on duty, Brett Asselin, made it possible for me to thoroughly enjoy my few hours in Boston. I had badly reinjured my hip from a previous accident and could hardly walk. I had a long flight back to Salt Lake later that afternoon. But I wanted to see Boston so badly, I went to the front desk and got advice on the tour and the pick-up stop right around the corner of the hotel. I knew I needed to have time to get back to my room to stretch out my hips before beginning my trip home. But that just would not have been possible without the late check-out I was given. I got to have breakfast at the Flat Iron and hop on the tour bus and go for their tour of the city, got back to my hotel, stretched out and rested for a few minutes, finished packing up and was at the front desk checking out 4 minutes before my check-out time! Thanks to your thoughtful staff, I got to make the very best of my short time in Boston. Boston is a wonderful city to which I hope to return. If I do, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be making a reservation at the Bullfinch Hotel!

More recently, we have thought the rooms are too small and crowded with missed placed, dated furniture that a small room could do without. We have found some of the rooms, particularly on the 4th floor, worn and in need of a redo.

There was also insufficient space on the floor to put your suitcase (let alone 2 suitcases and our room had no rack to put cases on) When we pointed these things out at the reception and asked to be moved, we were told that all the rooms in the hotel were pretty much the same size, so it wouldn't help moving, and anyway there were no available rooms, also the hotel did not have luggage racks, so tough luck.

The location is indeed convenient, being walking distance from downtown and close to lots of attractions, though the neighborhood seems a little sketchy at night. This hotel seems to be trying to style itself as a chic downtown destination for travelers of all kinds. But despite its reasonable pricing, compared to other hotels, its marketing hype does not match reality. On the good side, the service was very friendly. When I checked in, late on a Sunday night, the guy on the front desk was very helpful, and recommended some good restaurants to call for delivery that evening. But the friendly service was really the only thing that lived up to the hype. On the surface, the room I stayed in was quite nice, but looking closer I could not miss the stains on the heavy curtains and sofa, the dust clinging to the net curtains, some paint peeling in the bathroom, and the aircon/heating unit coming away from the wall. Don't get me wrong, this is not a dump by any means, and the room overall was clean (though it is crying out for a proper deep clean, in my view). But it is not at the standard the hotel seems to want to hit. The biggest surprise for me in relation to the room was the heavy spotting of mold across the bottom of the shower curtain, extending all the way across and almost a foot up from the bottom edge of the fabric. When I mentioned this to reception they very promptly sent someone up to replace the curtain. This could have been a really positive experience, but the replacement turned out to have mold spots too, albeit on a much smaller scale. This kind of thing underscores the fact that this hotel struggles to meet its own marketing. All of the above, though a little irritating, were no big deal for me, since I still felt the hotel was decent value for money. However, there was one experience which colored my overall stay and means I won't be back to the Bulfinch. One weeknight in the middle of my stay there was a live band playing downstairs in the restaurant attached to the hotel. Being directly above the restaurant on the next floor up I could hear, and feel, the music, especially the bass and drums, and was not able to sleep. Calling down to reception I discovered the band would not finish until midnight. On a weeknight, and for a hotel that says it's suitable for business clients, I really don't understand how they think it's okay to schedule something like that as there's obviously not adequate soundproofing to avoid disturbing the guests.

Location was the initial draw and location, as it turns out, is one of its best qualities. It lies in the north west within walking distance of The Wharf, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, and the Boston Common. Apparently, this location is just outside of the high rent district and thus allows for a more cost-effective alternative (about half) to some of the more central accommodations. The lobby and rooms are adequate even for a somewhat romantic getaway. It is an older hotel with smaller rooms. In its own way it has a charm and quaintness that balances the age. As it was, we spent little time in the room being out & about a lot. The staff was helpful, though not outstanding. We were so busy that we didn't mind the lack of a pool & spa.

The Story We reserved our hotel through hotels.com. Two days before our stay (which was also the first day of our road trip!), we got an upsetting email from hotels.com. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greetings from Hotels.com, We have been contacted by the The Bulfinch Hotel in regards to your reservation with them. Unfortunately the hotel is unable to accept your reservation. Due to these unforeseen circumstances, we would like to relocate you to another property. Please contact the Hotel Partner Support Department who will assist you in finding alternate accommodations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What??? My husband called hotels.com. Supposedly, the hotel was overbooked. I thought that only happened with airlines. During the attempt to find another hotel, the Bullfinch popped up as an option. Interesting. So I called the hotel directly. Call #1 to the hotel - The young lady who answered the phone simply said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hello\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. No \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hello, this is (insert name) at the Bullfinch Hotel. How can I help you?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That should have been a sign. After consulting with the manager on duty, she managed to confirm that we had a reservation but asked for a phone number \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just in case.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Call #2 to the hotel - Two days later, we called from the road to see if we could get a hold of someone more experienced. This time, we got someone who was certainly better at handling callers. This guy confirmed that the hotel was overbooked that night but hotels.com should not have tried to rebook us. He reassured us that the Bullfinch would take care of us. We would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walked into\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd another hotel in the worst case. We drove through a heavy thunderstorm and arrived in Boston. I waited in the car just in case we were going to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walked into\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd another hotel. When my husband texted me the name of the hotel we were getting shoved off to, I looked it up and it was nowhere near walking distance to Boston. Unacceptable. When I questioned the poor kid that was on duty that night, he explained that one of the managers had compiled a list of who would actually get a room. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the list. When was that list compiled? To add insult to injury, the kid tried to placate us with $10 from the petty cash drawer. That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even cover the room rate difference. After what I hope was a calm series of questions and name gathering, the kid told us that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d call the manager and, even though I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see him lift a phone or utter a word, he explained that he would be able to put us in a room (that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist 5 minutes ago). I understand the pressure to get as many rooms as possible booked.

It was my best friend's bachelorette party and I wanted everything to go perfect. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by the front desk quite poorly. No one offered to take the luggage we were carrying all over our bodies and there was no luggage cart, and it took them 20 minutes to just get us checked in. Why? I have no clue, they wouldn't explain to us why it took so long, only that \"it'll be just a couple minutes.\" I didn't realize a couple meant twenty. After finally checking in, they gave us our room keys, two rooms right across from each other, I thought, great! So NOT great. We got to our floor and put our keys in the lock and opened up to find a tiny room with one bed inside. The second room was exactly the same! So, carrying all our luggage again, we headed back to the front desk and told them that there was a mistake on their part by giving six people only two beds to sleep in! They told us they'd look into finding us new rooms, and their excuse for our original rooms? They told us that when people book rooms they usually get two beds because they don't want to share one so they figured that's what we were doing as well. I just looked at the guy that told me this and was astonished at how stupid that excuse sounded! So I gave him a piece of my mind and told him when I made the reservation I specifically asked for two rooms with two beds because we were having a bachelorette party and expecting many people to be staying overnight at the hotel. Then another person, who I had never seen at all since arriving at the hotel came up and offered us 4 rooms with 4 king beds at no additional cost, but we told him we wanted to stay together, and he gave us the attitude as if we were stupid to not take the offer! I think the stupid part was him assuming we'd be happy after their huge screw up!! We were having a bachelorette party, therefore we wanted to stay together!! So after about an hour after arriving at the hotel, they FINALLY were able to give us our two rooms with two beds, but on completely separate floors! To top of this grand ole evening at the Bulfinch, we called down to the front desk because we wanted to order room service and their catalogue didn't have a menu on the back (even though it said it would)! We were told by the front desk that we had to go down to the restaurant to get the menu and then we could order room service. I thought the point of room service was so that you didn't have to leave your room!??? The only thing I liked about this hotel at all was the fact that the rooms were clean and very quaint. The staff was rude, unprofessional, and their customer service was beyond pathetic. I have stayed at many hotels, bed and breakfasts and boutique style hotels and had never had this type of problem EVER with staffing and customer service. My best friend, the bride to be, got yelled by the woman working at the front desk (who I'm assuming was new because she had no idea what she was doing the whole time and always had to ask for someone to step in and help), and last I checked my best friend did nothing wrong, they did!

I did request an early check-in because we were arriving by train at 10:45 a.m. and wanted a place to put our bags before heading out for the day. Because the hotel was completely sold out the night before, they could not provide early check-in. However, they offered to keep our bags safe while we went out for the day, which was fine by us. After exploring and shopping for the day, we arrived back at the hotel to check-in and was told that the TV in our room was not working and if the TV was something that we wanted to watch they would upgrade us to a King suite at no extra charge (we had booked a room with 2 double beds). TV was not that important to us, but we did want to catch up of the news, so they upgraded us to a King suite on the ninth floor. The suite was large enough for us. It also had a queen sofa sleeper that my friend said was very comfortable to sleep on. There was also a desk and chair, closet with an iron and ironing board, coffee table with a fairly large TV. The bathroom had a large stand-up tiled shower, nice sink area with bottles of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and showel gel, hair dryer, etc. The room was adequate in size and was nice and clean. Being 90 degrees in Boston the air conditioner worked great and kept the room very cool. I had booked the room online for their summer rate special and we received 2 complimentary tapas coupons for their Flatiron restaurant. I had the tomato mozzarella & basil salad. The portion was smaller than I expected, but tasted good. My friend had their caesar salad with chicken and said it was the best she has ever had. The portion was a good size and very filling for her. We also received a basket of bread with dipping oil. The food that we had was good and we were full by the time we left. I did notice the comments regarding poor customer service and have to say that we never experienced poor service from the staff that we interacted with. They were quite friendly and very helpful.

I believe any quality hotel could ask rude, drunken and disorderly guest to leave, but they choose to value the loud guests over us.

While the rooms have been described as small they were adequate for the two Queen beds, although the freestanding wardrobe had, of necessity, to be fairly dinky. Still, there was a large screen TV and the bathroom was a reasonable size and well appointed. Location is good. It's an easy ten minute walk to Quincy market etc. and, in the opposite direction about 15 minutes to the Science Museum and the DUCK tour (recommended!) bus terminal and a further five plus to the best Boston shopping at the Cambridge Galleria. There's the subway, a supermarket, fast food outlets, a wine/beer outlet all less then five minutes around the corner (sadly no 'fridge in the hotel room though) and pubs and restaurants a little further on in Portland and Canal Streets.

Having booked this hotel thru priceline, I still thought it was EXTREMELY expensive for a hotel. Boston seems to have a shortage of hotel rooms, therefore the prices seem much higher than even NYC. I bid for several days on priceline and was unable to get even a 3 star hotel for less than $175 night. At first I was told it would be a double bed room, but when we checked in, late, we had been upgraded to a king size bed (thankfully). I can't imagine paying $200 per night for one double bed!! The staff were always helpful and courteous. Although beware the 'car service' back to the airport. I asked for a taxi and the girl called a limo. I flagged down a taxi before I realized what was happening. The limo pulled up at the same time as the taxi. A taxi cost me $15 at 7am on a Monday, and the car service thru the hotel would have been $25. The front desk told me it would be cheaper for the car, when in fact it was not. I think you are better off in a taxi unless traffic is horrible. It took about 10 minutes to get to Logan from the hotel. The room was on the small side but I had no expectation that it would be large given all that I had read. I was happy enough to have the king size bed. The linens were clean and comfortable, with a lot of pillows on the bed. A decent size TV, coffee maker, and free internet access were a good perk. The towels were fluffy and soaps were above average quality. The walls had some damage, which for the price, I would expect not to see. Overall, it was very clean and comfortable and met my expectation on this front. The location is great. A very quick walk to the North End, Boston Common or Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall. Also close to Haymarket or North Station train stations. Boston is really small and easy to navigate on foot. If you are accustomed to walking, you will love Boston. The area was quiet and almost deserted at night. We only ate one breakfast at the restaurant, and it was good. Otherwise, there is a Dunkin Donuts or Au Bon Pain right around the corner. I did have some issues with noise from the hallway. We were in room 505, around the corner from the elevator. Our neighbors came home late/early and were quite noisy and woke me up.

However, I believe the problem that I experienced speaks volumes about the management of the Bulfinch. I stayed there one night. My initial greeting and the appearance of my room was good. However, the problem began at approximately midnight when a hotel neighbor began knocking on a nearby hotel room door and calling for someone to let the neighbor into the room. I don't want to go into too much detail about the neighbor, but suffice it to say, the knocking and yelling created disturbing noise for a full 2 hours, until about 2am. Being a frequent traveler for business, I realize that some amount of noise from hotel neighbors comes with the territory. And, I do realize that a hotel does not have control over the problems that may occur with its guests. However, the hotel has absolute control over how they handle such a situation, and the Bulfinch fails on many levels. Problem #1: the hotel lost the master key. Problem #2: the hotel let a guest know that they lost the master key. Problem #3: the hotel allowed guests to be disturbed during prime sleeping hours for a full 2 hours (approx midnight to 2am). There is absolutely no excuse for this lack of management control. As an aside, another guest on my floor had placed a room service tray outside the door (which I noticed sometime around 9pm) and this tray still sat at the door by 8:30am the next day. By itself this might seem picky, but again, I think it is indicative of a bigger problem with management. Had management responded timely and properly to the extraordinary circumstance of one of its obviously distressed guests (my hotel neighbor), I would have been writing a very different opinion. I did wait a week to write this so I could settle down and have some perspective. Hopefully, the Bulfinch will learn from this experience and hone its management skills so as not to put any future guests through what we had to endure.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cWell designed, but lacking\u201d", "Author": "ophiodon", "ReviewID": "UR18206471", "Content": "The Bulfinch has the typical, but well designed austerity of a lot of modern botique hotels.

I arrived at the hotel a bit too early for the 3:30 p.m. check-in but the hotel gladly held my bags while I searched for lunch in the area.

When I returned to the hotel to check-in, the process was quick and efficient. The small lobby requires some manuevering if you have big bags. A nice touch - there's water dispensers next to the elevator, great refresh on a hot day. The rooms are small, but it is a city hotel in a really cool building. The style is a bit modern, with some retro touches. Because of the architecture of the building, my room had a funky, long hallway-shaped bathroom. The bathroom was nice, marble counters and good amenities. My bath only had a stand-up shower, which is fine for me, since I don't normally take baths in hotels. Good water pressure in the shower too! The bed was comfortable and the reading lights were adequate. The only complaints I had was there was no closet, just a wardrobe and more importantly to me, no luggage rack and that the air conditioner unit blew directly on you if you were working at the desk, which seems like I'm reaching to complain about something! I did not eat in the hotel restaurant so I can't comment on that. But I did really like this hotel.

I wasnt really interested but just nodded, we were then guided into our room, Our room consisted of a double bed, a desk and chair and a half size wardrobe. The room was VERY! small compared to what we had been staying in but it was very clean and had an upto date modern appearance. The hotel is in the best location with everything close to hand, even china town is within walking distance. We booked our hotel through a web site and paid little for our accomodation. On reading the room rates on the wardrobe door it would appear that they are charging $400 per night. If i had to pay that then i would have something to moan about.

I had read some of the latest reviews on T/A and was a little concerned that the Bulfinch might have gone downhill since my last stay. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Bulfinch continues to be an excellent value in the North Station area of Boston. As I was arriving in Boston around 1:00 PM I had emailed the hotel to ask for an early arrival. This was not a problem at all. I had booked one of the larger \"nose\" rooms at the hotel to see what they were like. Check in was very smooth and I was in my 3rd floor nose room in no time. The nose room really was worth the extra $$$. The windows on all sides of the room are great. It really makes the room feel larger. The room was very clean and was very practical. I felt the bedding was excellent and the bed was very comfortable. I did not try the restaurant at the hotel as I prefer to eat in the Italian North End when visiting Boston.

This hotel let me down in such a major way. I have no idea why this one is #11 of all Boston hotel, when it should be at least 45 in my opinion. I am an experienced traveler, who has stayed in all kind of hotels, from cheap roadside motels to fancy Ritz Carltons. The Bulfinch has the quality of the former, much more than the latter. And here's why: It's cheap through and through. Not cheap in price, mind you -- because it does bill itself as a \"hip boutique\" hotel -- but cheap in its materials, construction, design. In everything. Let's start with their reception. My sister and I arrived late in the evening to find one lone person working behind the desk in the tiny lobby. It took him about 20 minutes to look up our info, get our keys ready. It was the longest check-in I've ever experienced. While I waited for this guy, I helped myself to the coffee that was by the one lone elevator that serves this seven-story building. Alas, both the milk and cream containers were empty -- first sign of trouble ahead. Finally, we had our keys and headed to our room. We walked in -- but it was a room with one bed, when we had very clearly booked online and got confirmation for a deluxe double. Back downstairs we went, followed by more waiting. The guy told us that they actually had no doubles. Excellent! This was getting interesting...Ultimately, the guy -- without any kind of apology for the error in their system with our booking -- placed one of us in their \"classic\" room and the other in the suite. On two different floors. Ok, both rooms are pathetically tiny. But the \"classic\" room is really a walk-in closet. There's a full-size bed (it's been a while since I've seen a full-size bed in a hotel single room, most normal hotel singles come with queen beds) that is literally wedged into a nook in the room. There is about foot between the wall and the bed, making it quite a challenge to get in and out of it. A tiny wardrobe (there's no closet) with a desk and a large, heavy cumbersome chair as well as a large TV (all the furniture had cracks and chips on it) completed the decor. There's no bath tub. They could have easily fit one into the bathroom, but chose to only have a small shower instead. Cheap. The towels are horrible -- coarse and flat. The hotel didn't want to invest in nice towels. The design is awkward. The doors of the wardrobe bang against the desk when opened. The toilet paper roll in the bathroom is placed so far from the toilet that you have to practically get up off the toilet to reach it. There are gaps between the window and the wall -- weird long gaps. But the worst of all things was the bed. It was the worst bed I had ever slept on -- some cheap brand I had never heard of, reminded me of a cot I slept on in camp. It had no thickness, sank like a hole in the middle, had no kind of pillowtop as is standard in a boutique hotel. I had aches all over my body after a night on that mattress. The pillows were all mismatched, the comforter was the weirdest I've ever seen -- had no quilting and depth in the middle, but just around the edges. So it was like a flat sheet with quilting around it. Very weird. Also had a nice brown stain on it. If a hotel cannot provide an adequate bed and bedding, then it has truly failed in my eyes. This one did. The building has no kind of security. At one point, the guy downstairs (the one who took ages to check us in) just disappeared somewhere and was gone for a while. There was no one minding the front entrance. Anyone from the street could have walked in. I am not complaining here, I am literally describing what I saw. If you don't feel like you require a comfy bed in your hotel, then stay here; or stay if you don't mind cheap, chipped furnishings, or if you don't mind a room about 150 sq. feet, or if you don't mind not having security in the hotel...But at an average price of $170 a night, you can do much better than the Bulfinch.

For those who like wide-open spaces and hotels rooms large enough to house a small army, this may not be the ideal choice of accomodation. What the Bulfinch has brilliantly done is taken a small and unique piece of real estate and turned it into a reasonably priced hotel with comfortable king-sized beds with Egyptian cotton sheets (and duvet cover), marble bathrooms, and great interior design. The reason it is reasonably priced is because of the room size - we had just enough room for the bed and our bags, and a walk-in glass/marble shower instead of a full bathtub. To my thinking, it's perfect - a super-nice room, modern and meticulously cleaned, no gross polyester bedspread, and affordable for a weekend getaway to see the Red Sox. The restaurant has been redone since we were here last, and although we didn't eat there the menu looked terrific and not too expensive. The tea/coffee station in the lobby was a big bonus, with lots of herbal tea options in addition to the old standards.

It certainly was challenging for the staff to manage this, however the hotel staff maintained excellent service and where kind enough to componsate our bill, which was much appreciated. There is no going past this hotel and would recommend it to any traveller.

They gave a completely accurate picture of what to expect. The hotel is more of an European hotel, w/ small lobby, small rooms, but just what a family of six needed in the summer. We shared two corner rooms that were clean and comfortable and had nice a/c. (If you are spending too much time in the room, you aren't taking advantage of a great city). If you have to stay in the room all is well, the bathrooms were large, modern and clean, the beds were absolutely fine. The only real down side for us was really the location, which sounds funny, but it was because we had a car. For those with a car, there is no real parking, so you have to park at a garage across the street. But parking is available if you need it, and parking is a nightmare in the city anyway. The area it is located is near where the old Boston garden was, so if you can picture the area, you know it is near the heart of everything in Boston. My son and I walked to the Science museum, walked to the T to see the Red Sox and for people without kids, it is probably even better. There is a au bon pain that is open on the weekdays in a bld next door and a bunch of other small restaurants nearby. Otherwise the hotel and the people who run it were great.

However, what really set this hotel apart for me was the quality and friendliness of the staff as well as the cool rooms. I would consider this a \"boutique\" hotel, so if you are looking for a large lobby to hang out in, or a pool for the kids, this isn't for you. However, since I was by myself and only had a day and a half to see the sights, I couldn't have picked a better place - great staff, super comfy beds, quiet rooms (no neighbor or street noise), free internet access, nice view from the upper floor. I had two SMALL problems while staying here: 1) The hot water didn't work in the sink in my first room. This was so promptly attended to (I was immediately put in a room on the 8th floor - bonus for me!) that I was almost embarrassed at the number of apologies and the amount of attention I received. 2) There is no room service.

This was somewhat of an inconvenience for me personally. All around, however, this was an awesome experience.", "Date": "March 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and great location for Garden and Quincy Mkt\u201d", "Author": "geekie", "ReviewID": "UR4370439", "Content": "Just spent 2 nights at the Bulfinch, while in town for Billy Joel. This hotel has a great location, just around the corner from the Garden. The rooms are small, but large enough for 2. We had a king bed on the 2nd floor. The bed is just the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on! Plenty of great pillows as well. Probably the one negative point would be the bathroom, it had a sliding door on it that doesn't offer much privacy and has only a large shower, no tub. The staff at the hotel are very professional and helpful. We also enjoyed dinner at the Black Angus Steakhouse that is located in the hotel. Good service and a great dinner! If you are going to events at the Garden, this is the place to stay. Price was good, booked on Clarion website for $125.10/night with AAA. Parking is around the corner at $25.00/day with no in/out ability, you must be out by 12 noon on the day of checkout. Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall are about 1/4 mile away. Area seems safe enough, although we did encounter several people asking for money. If you are into nightlife, there are many bars/clubs within walking distance.", "Date": "January 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mystic, CT", "Title": "\u201cBullfinch a Winner!\u201d", "Author": "MysticKid", "ReviewID": "UR4352528", "Content": "Stayed at the Bullfinch after getting the link from the Celtics website.

We originally requested a standarad room but they upgraded us to a junior suite on a AAA rate. Room was perfectly clean, 8th floor suite w/ tremendous windows. Bathroom w/ shower only was all marble, very cool w/ great shower. Ate in the Angus steakhouse downstairs w/ a so-so kitchen but the maitre D and waiter were so nice, free chocolate cake that they made up for it. Best of all, was the 2 block/2 minute walk to the Boston Garden. Christian the check in guy was so helpful and informative, simply great service.

As well, the restaurant in the hotel has the BEST beef that money can buy. If you get the chance to stay there or even if your just passing by, I highly recommend that you try either the Hamburger platter or the Rib Eye Steak sandwich. Nothing to complain about here.

The lobby and public areas were spotless, and the hotel staff were friendly and available to help us with everything from dining suggestions to directions around town. The standard room we were in was very large for our needs, and we felt quite comfortable. Indeed, the first morning after arriving, we didn't want to get out from beneath the cozy surroundings. Our shower was well appointed and there was no lack of hot water for our morning routines. The bathrooms were well suited for 2 people getting ready in the morning. This is not an area with many hotels - indeed, our cab from Boston Back Bay to the hotel (which was $8, for reference) didn't know of the hotel, or that there was a hotel in the area! Close to public transportation (North Station), the Museum of Science, and plenty of fast food (Dunkin Donuts, Burger King, etc) and 24-hour convenience stores nearby. We felt quite comfortable at all times in the neighborhood, and most tourist spots we visited are a short walk or T ride away.", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Things Come In Small Packages\u201d", "Author": "vikkiCork_Ireland", "ReviewID": "UR4106244", "Content": "We stayed at The Bulfinch Hotel from 04 November until 10 November on a shopping trip from Ireland.

The rooms have very high ceilings which make them seem bigger than they are and the decor was great. The staff were so polite and helpful with any information or assistance we required before and during our stay. We were also given a late check out as our flight were in the evening and our luggage was held until departure. The hotel location is superb 5 minutes stroll to Quincy Market or The Fleet Centre, 10 minutes to Downtown Crossing and Cambridgeside. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Boston, it far outranks many hotels considered \"superior\" that I have stayed in on previous visits. The hotel does not serve breakfast but there is a great deli ( eat in or takeaway ) across the road. We found the level of service provided outstanding.

If the Garden is your destination, you can't beat this hotel for its location alone. It only took us a couple of minutes to walk door to door. The place is in great condition (it's new, so this is to be expected), and SPOTLESSLY clean (and I'm a fanatic when it comes to cleanliness in a hotel room). The bathrooms are very nice. On the downside, the rooms are TINY-- not \"on the small side\" but TINY. We had a room with two double beds, so perhaps the single-bed rooms have more elbow room. However, our room didn't even have enough space to open up a suitcase without putting it on the bed (no room for a valet here!) --definitely not a room I would want to stay in for several days. I thought the room was very expensive ($232 incl. taxes -- AAA rate), considering its size and the lack of amenities offered by this hotel. There is a decent steakhouse next door, but again, VERY expensive (it wasn't the food, but the bar bill that was a shocker!) There are, however, lots a restaurant options in the area. All in all, this hotel is very good, but overpriced. If you don't require a double room, and if you can get a good price on a room, grab it...I don't think you'll be disappointed. (A quick response to some other reviews: this is NOT a bad area of the city. I lived and worked in Boston for several years, and this area was always a little \"grittier\" than Back Bay or Beacon Hill, but it has undergone a gentrification of sorts in the past few years. The removal of the elevated train tracks in front of the Garden has also done a lot for this area. When (and if) the Big Dig is finished, this area will definitely be the better for it.)", "Date": "November 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cA New Gem in Boston\u201d", "Author": "CuriousGeorge_NY", "ReviewID": "UR4091210", "Content": "I stayed here over the weekend.
