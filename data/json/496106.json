We decided this place sounded a lot more interesting, so we switched our reservations over, and I'm very happy we did. Location is incredibly convenient - West Queen West is a straight shot by streetcar to anywhere you'd need to be, and there are so many great restaurants and shops nearby, we found ourselves enjoying a 3-4 km walk between conference and hotel just because we wanted to stop in at so many places. The hotel is right across from a public parking lot, where we easily prepaid for the whole stay's worth of parking, no worries at all. The hotel itself is easy to find and just lovely - modern design, a great gift shop of quirky presents, fantastic bath products, and an all-around friendly and cool atmosphere that never crossed into hipper-than-thou territory. I had been a little worried about noise since it was St Patricks Day weekend and I had to be up early every day, but the sounds of the restaurant faded as soon as we walked into the room hall, and only one or two short instances of chatter were all we ever heard or saw of other guests or pedestrians, even though we were just on the 2nd floor. (Room 205 was perfect.) One aside: I saw several reviews here mentioned the manager by name, and how fantastic he was. I found this a little surprising, since how many places that aren't b&b do you even meet the manager? However, we had a minor issue with our room (pipe leaking), and not only did Jonathan find us for a personal chat about it with options, he was so incredibly nice and helpful about it that I could immediately see why people remember his name and rave about him. I would absolutely stay here again. I would not recommend the place to older guests uncomfortable with a semi-club atmosphere in the evenings, or those with kids who need space or amenities of chain hotels, but thumbs up to couples, close friends (the glass showers are awesome but there is no mystery to be had), and those passing through wanting something beyond a cookie cutter room!", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDelightful, fun and friendly - can't imagine better!\u201d", "Author": "Annie O", "ReviewID": "UR126301302", "Content": "My partner and I just spent our anniversary at The Drake and swore we will regularly find reasons to return.

On returning from dinner we discovered that someone had been in the room, plumped the pillows and turned the heater on. There was a bad smell of burning, the kind you get when you switch on a dusty heater for the first time in months.

The staff could not be any cooler and friendlier--not usually the combination one assumes when thinking 'cool staff in a cool hotel'. The secret however is that these are real people, who are really cool (many of them artists) and not people who put on an act to try and score tips by pretending to be what you think you want them to be. The rooms (I've stayed in a crashpad and a Studio, are the height of functional design; smaller probably than other rooms in the city, the crashpads are literally just that. Enough space to sleep, refresh and store your stuff for a night or three. The studio and larger rooms have great little seating areas and a bit more space to throw your stuff around. All rooms have great use of space and great touches such as vintage hospital-type furniture (the chair in my room on my last visit). Bathroom products are good.

Firstly, we had a very warm welcome to the hotel by Zoe which was great. After struggling up stairs with our bags and down a dimmly lit corridor we found our room. It was a \"crash pad\". The thing that just didn't appeal to me at all was that the bathroom is IN the room. A sliding door with light frosting for the toilet and clear glass for the shower. Personally, I like a degree of privacy in the bathroom so this was not for me. I know other more expensive rooms with different configurations are available, but the \"crash pad\" was expensive enough for me thanks. The toilet cystern dripped all night which disturbed my sleep too... I asked for it to be fixed but it never was (successfully at any rate). There were lots of trays of goodies in the room which is exciting at first.. until you realize there is absolutely nothing complimentary... not even mineral water... everything must be purchased. Another slightly wierd thing is that there are no plugs for the sinks. We asked at reception for one but there aren't any (they suggested we stuff a facecloth in the plug hole).... difficult for wet shavers. We tried the restaurant, but I'm a vegetarian and there was nothing I saw on the menu for me (I know the management has addressed this in other reviews saying there are some things and something could be made specially, but I think this should be made more apparent). My wife is not veggie, but there was nothing she fancied either. We actually went up the street to The Gladstone each night to eat (which was excellent by the way). We went into the breakfast bar the next morning. The girl behind the counter wasn't sure which parts of the menu we were allowed to order from at that time (10:30ish?) but then a waiter helped her out. The food was ok, but quite expensive for what it was (we went to the Starbucks down the street each morning from then on). The staff in the breakfast cafe also had a wierd attitude... more into their own little world and conversations that the customers. We felt a bit uncomfortable.. (except for Chels?.. she was really nice). We tried the rooftop bar one night and ordered a pitcher of sangria... oh dear.. it tasted like grapefruit juice and we had to leave most of it. It cost $30 odd too so we didn't go back there either. The hotel is a good 25 min walk from the centre which is a bit of a pain too.. I'd pick somewhere closer if I went again.

I arrived days before the film festival and the hotel was already packed.

That was all right, I wanted a drink, really, and I told the woman behind the desk, Kayla, exactly that. She stepped from behind the desk and took me to the bar, introduced me to the bartender, Stephen, and asked me what I needed (a drink, a room), what I wanted to do during my four-day stay (bike, eat, art, drink), and moments later I was drinking a Creemore (a Canadian amber lager) Stephen recommended, and talking to Kiki, a Drake manager, about bike, eat, art, drink in Toronto . . .

The shower, sink and toilet were elevated from the rest of the room and each separated by a glass partition. The bathroom fixtures were modern and the glass surprisingly spotless. The queen-sized bed had expensive linens and four big pillows. I had plenty of racks and hooks to stow my stuff and the Drake even provided a terrycloth robe. My favorite touch was the umbrella. Every hotel ought to provide its guests with an umbrella, I think . . . I loved Toronto. Always a glass of water with a glass of beer. Dogs allowed on the streetcars. Washroom sounds so much better that bathroom. Brunch 24/7. The quietest big city ever, seldom a siren or a raised voice.

The look of the room, hallways, and the entire hotel had a lot of detail. A friend staying in another hotel visited and loved the 80s movie quotes strewn throughout the place. Given its vibrant nightlife (which is eclectic and fun), I asked for and got one of the quieter rooms on the top floor and never heard a peep from the many bars. The only time noise was an issue was my last night from the neighbouring room; perhaps the couple had ordered something from the Pleasure Menu, which apparently and audibly did its job over and over again in the night and early morning. My other issue was the wi-fi signal that frustratingly got weak the further you went into the top floor hallway and became nearly zero upon entering the room. Glad they had the computer and printer for guests to use. But the thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll remember about the place was the genuine and superlative service from the front desk, the cafe, the bars, and the security guards on the busy nights.

From the earliest stages of the planning process, Ashley, the Drake's wonderful event coordinator, made planning our wedding easy and fun. She helped us create the vision we wanted for our special day, and did all the work, so we could just do the fun stuff. The wedding night itself was perfect. The food was absolutely incredible and we received so many compliments from our guests. The music by DJ Dougie Boom kept the dance floor packed all night. We received so many comments from our guests about the amazing service at the wedding- from the wait staff, to the bar staff, to the hotel staff. Jerry was great at welcoming everyone at the door (he kept our party goers happy and kept crashers out!). Many of our guests were so impressed that they emailed either us or the Drake staff the next day. It was great to hear that the staff weren't just helpful to us, (as the ones footing the bill!) but they were equally as dedicated to making sure everyone there enjoyed themselves. Jonathan, the hotel manager, was helpful both during the weeks leading up to the wedding and on the night itself. Our room was great! Since it was our wedding night, we treated ourselves to the suite. It was quite large and I love the design of everything - the room itself is like a work of art - but there is also plenty of cool looking art on the walls - two TV's too. I felt like I could just hang out in the room for days! There are lots of neat little touches too - design books and magazines, gourmet snacks and drinks in the mini-bar, luxury soap and shampoo in the bathroom, etc. My parents also had a room, the salon room, smaller than the suite, but it was still spacious enough for a bride, a niece, and three ladies to get ready for a wedding in, two photographers taking pictures, a mom standing by with moral support and a brother-of-honour...basically standing around I guess. My parents commented that when they went to the cafe for breakfast, the staff knew who they were right away and asked about the wedding - my parents loved that! The Drake is a great place to have dinner, to have drinks, to stay overnight, or to have an event.

As her loving and devoted daughter, it was my job to select the accommodations. I had spent some summer mornings having brunch at the streetside cafe, seen a live show in the Underground and spent a memorable evening in the Sky Yard and thought it was time that I rounded out my experience at the Drake with an overnight visit. No one does customer service like the Drake and here's a little story to illustrate... Not only did I call and get a person on the phone after just a couple of rings, the person I got turned out to be Jonathon, the manager. Jonathon helped me choose his favourite room and gave me a rate that I couldn't say no to. He promised to arrange a car service to the airport for me and to make everything perfect in every way. When we arrived on a very, very hot May day, we were greeted with, 'you must be Kate and her Mum. We've been expecting you.' Indeed, we were. They carried our bags, left us a love note in the room and pointed us toward the places we needed to go. Although we didn't need a thing, we had our pick of great wine, delicious treats and interesting treasures for purchase in the room. As a person who loves Mother Nature, I was most pleased to see the efforts that the nice people at the Drake go to to ensure that she doesn't weep every time a guest checks out. There was a notable absence of waste - stupid little bottles of terrible shampoo were replaced with lovely regular sized bottles of everything a girl could need to clean herself up and instructions on how to purchase the entire bottle if desired. What an ingenious way to make sure that a half bottle of shower gel and the plastic it came in aren't winding up in the landfill. Also, the towels were the right size for a human body...not that I don't love drying off with the face cloths most hotels try to pass off as a bath towel...but they really had nice towels, too. We slept well in the cool, dark and peaceful room. The bed was excellent, the bedding was divine and we could hear the sound of laughter and happiness coming from outside. The sound was faint and charming and it sure beats the sound of the 401 rushing past or elevator doors opening. Early in the morning, we came out onto the landing and were greeted by Alan from the front desk who so kindly carried my enormous bag for me and said, 'Good morning Kate. We have coffee and cake ready for you to enjoy while you wait for your limo.' When we asked if he would like a piece, like a gracious host he said, 'I thought you'd never ask'. Good old Alan. Not only did he carry my things, join us for an early morning snack but he even crammed into the functioning photo booth with us so he could be documented as part of our memory for life. The car service they arranged for me was...well, there are really no words for how perfect it was. The driver was efficient and made the right kind of 6:00 a.m. ride to the airport conversation. Once he and Alan had loaded my things into the trunk and I came outside, he opened it to show me that all of my bags were safely inside, which goes a long way in reassuring a traveler that she'll get to BC with her underpants in order. As I sat in the airport awaiting my flight, I received an email from dear, sweet Jonathon. Remember him from the beginning? He rushed in in the morning to try to catch me and say goodbye but unfortunately I was just too stealthy for him, so he had to wish me a great trip by email. A great beginning to a great trip. I am pretty sure that the manager at the Comfort Inn doesn't do that. The customer service at the Drake lacks nothing.

Which we would release to you upon checkout. That sounded perfect. I didn't want to much of a hold on my cc as Toronto was just a stop on our trip to Montreal. I than followed up with the hotel yesterday to confirm everything. This time the answer was different from the response I had the first time.

I Had explained to her the Conversation I had with the first guy and how I would be traveling and wasn't expecting to pay that much for a deposit fee. She understood and said that she would need a manager approval to possibly make the deposit lower. The manager of the hotel \"Anna\" phoned me back. And once again. I Heard a completely different amount to my surprise she had told me that in fact the cost was 250 cc or the option of 250 cash deposit. And that's how it has been for 4 yrs. When I had told her what the other employees had told me all she said was well I'm going to have to coach them on our policy.

Yes, the funny, funky doll with chest hair and bondage gear was there, but so was a big screen TV hooked up to DVD player; a very cool sitting area with daybed/sofa, and original art throughout. Despite being the largest room, it was still compact and made great use of space.

Yum! Speaking of which, the brunch was fantastic and the weather was beautiful so the patio was open and we got to experience good food and people watch all in one sitting!

The Drake is an intimate, classy, elegant and gorgeous place. The rooms are cozy, impeccably clean, comfortable, and absolutely beautiful. The entire atmosphere, from the restaurant to the rooms, is the sought-after mixture of sophistication and relaxation that so many establishments strive for but few ever attain. The staff is friendly and heartwarmingly helpful, so much so that if you can treat them like people instead of employees you will find that they become friends by the end of your stay. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in a great many of the best hotels across the Caribbean, the United States, Canada, and Europe, and cannot recommend any of them more highly than the Drake Hotel. Now for the long version of our experience. I was planning my proposal evening, and since we lived a fair distance away from Toronto, I needed a place for me and my newly-engaged girlfriend to stay in. Cost was no object; I wanted the evening to be magical and perfect. I visited every hotel worthy of mention in Toronto, touring their different suites and rooms, inspecting them carefully, but after visiting the Drake none of them remained an option. As a sort of measure of how much the Drake appealed to me: I turned down top-floor suites with sweeping views of downtown Toronto, luxurious multi-room affairs with every amenity imaginable. You see, every hotel I have ever visited in has a faint aroma of bureaucratic coldness that lingers in the air, no matter how hard they try to cover it up. Not so at the Drake. For the first time, I felt at home in a hotel. I felt like I could relax, chat with the staff, or lounge in the lobby. The actual environment, from the lobby on up to the rooms, is disarming, and it begins to work its magic as soon as you pass through the large glass doors of the hotel. After being pleasantly surprised at how helpful the manager was, and at how far they were willing to go to accommodate my many preparatory requests, I booked one of their Salon rooms. As one caveat, the design of the rooms is definitely most suitable for couples. There is little in the way of private space, and the clear shower walls mean that only the romantically involved or the supremely comfortable will be able to room together. As for our actual stay, it could not have gone better. The staff went above and beyond the call of duty to make us feel welcome, to ensure that everything went perfectly, and even that we felt loved. When our arranged taxi was late, the manager went out into the winter street in a tee-shirt to rustle up another. After we departed, he called the restaurant and arranged to have our reservation held for us. The room was beautifully decorated and gloriously snug. The bed was very comfortable, and the complimentary designer toiletries and shampoos were delightful (in particular, the mint shampoo is an experience in itself). The room also includes an Ipod dock with speakers and a CD player. The room is extremely well-designed, and despite the fact that they look small in pictures can contain more than four large suitcases without feeling at all cramped. The Drake also offers an astounding number of extras for a special occasion, which I took advantage of. Lilies awaited us in the room when we first arrived and when we returned from dinner rose petals were scattered about the room and in the shape of a heart on the bed. Plates of delicious chocolates and other sweets were also waiting. The rooms are lit with a number of halogen lights, which can be individually adjusted for lighting ranging from bright and cheerful to low and romantic. The room itself was spotlessly clean, and featured a number of mirrors (a fact which my girlfriend -> fianc\u00c3\u00a9 appreciated enormously). The morning after, we descended the central staircase to smiles and applause from the staff and were then treated to complimentary mimosas. We spent much of the morning in the restaurant, where we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast, fresh oysters, and the wide view of Queen Street. The windows in the restaurant face the morning sun, and the red velvet divan was sinfully comfortable. As a side note, the food was excellent. The oysters were as fresh as I have ever tasted (I am something of an addict, if not an aficionado, for seafood of all kinds), the eggs and bacon were delicious, and the Drake\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mojitos are superb. All in all, I cannot overstress how wonderful the Drake is. It is truly a unique and unrivaled gem, and there is literally nothing besides its early check-out times (11 or 12 in the morning) that I can complain about. It is a fantastic, amazing place that stands head and shoulders above its competitors on an international level. It is not for nothing that it is listed by many reputable travel magazines as one of the best hotels in the world. I can vouch for the conclusion that the Drake Hotel is one of the finest romantic hotels in the world.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit", "Title": "\u201cAmazing from start to finish\u201d", "Author": "ilikedat", "ReviewID": "UR30884618", "Content": "What can I say...the Drake is by far the best place I have ever stayed.

The thing about the Drake is that everyone who works there is beautiful and also (coming from big cities in the US, especially) ridiculously nice. The skybar was fun, the nightclub was packed and playing Prince. (We didn't do the other bar.) NB: I only gave service three stars b/c although they were nice, you have to call downstairs to get almost anything. That's fine, but when we were there they seemed to only have one person--the desk person--doing everything.

The Drake Hotel has to be one of the most unique, wonderful, special hotels in all the world...and I've travelled the globe quite a bit. From the moment you walk in you are in design heaven. The design eye and sensibility behind The Drake is evident in every single detail. The lobby, the rooms, the cocktail lounge, the underground bar, the cafe--every single space is a visual delight, the kind that has you oohing and ahhing outloud. And while yes, the look of the hotel is ultra cool--and the vibe backs that up-- the people at The Drake could not be nicer or warmer or more genuine. Go to a spot like this in London or New York and you'd typically find the staff a bit pretentious; this is so not the case here. I think that pairing is what makes this place so fabulous and desirable: uber cool and of-the-moment in its look and hub of activity but wonderful, real, kind, helpful people bringing it all to life. I will definitely return to The Drake; there is nothing like it in the world. You should put it at the top of your list for experiences in this lifetime. Some of the unbelievably amazing people you should look out for and get to know: Jonathan, Zoe and Ana at the front desk; Mia the curator who will show you the hotel's fantastic art; and Anthony in the cafe. signed, Amy from Chicago", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton, FL", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Energy, Great Service\u201d", "Author": "ann160", "ReviewID": "UR21220083", "Content": "What a wonderful place - full of beautiful art, interesting people and the staff is outstanding.

Firstly, the noise. We were in the previously mentioned room 203. I guess we could've ignored being woken every morning at 7.30am by the awnings on the cafe downstairs being opened. But on the first night there was an art event in Toronto called Nuit Blanche, which apparently is a great excuse to pump loud house music into your room until the police arrive at 4.40am to break things up. I rang down at 3.20am to find out how much longer it would last (and informed it'd only be another 20 minutes or so - I'm guessing the 'or so' meant 'add another hour on to that) and request ear plugs, only to be told that they had no earplugs, that there wasn't anything they could do and not actually hear the word 'sorry'. Had we have had some warning or an apology, we'd probably have been fine about it, but with none forthcoming, it was a hardly an auspicious start to our stay. On our last night, mindful of having an overnight flight we went to bed a bit early (midnightish), but at two am had to check the room wasn't being broken into because of the noise of the bar opposite kicking out - believe me, it's not quiet. I do not believe for a second that we're the only ones to complain about the noise in the room if that's the norm. Next, the room. Now it's small, and I appreciate that they're trying to create an illusion of space. The problem comes when to compensate, you need to be the kind of couple who don't mind using the toilet in front of each other, because the toilet (and shower) are glass. Granted, there's a bit of frosting on the toilet door, but you are aware that your loved one is mere centimetres away, and I'm more one for keeping a certain amount of mystery, myself. The dvd player in the room was a nice touch (although I guess that's as much for the 'pleasure menu' users than for our benefit), and handy because the tv wasn't actually tuned in, and most of the channels were fuzz. One night, our blind fell down, which I was really panicked about, but when we went to apologise, we were told it was okay, it was already broken. So shouldn't it have been fixed before your guests arrive, then? As for the menu, during our stay I didn't notice it change once. Furthermore, if you're a vegetarian, you better be fond of grilled cheese sandwiches or mushrooms on toast. Because other than sushi, you won't find much else. Oh and that late night menu that the management previously mentioned - only on a Friday or Saturday. Otherwise, if you ask for a cheese sandwich after 11pm, it's a no go (although some hardcore dvds and a whip would be fine, apparently - I did check for edible undies on the offchance of getting a snack though). The staff - excluding the sweet blonde guy on the front desk - were at best a little frosty. At worst, we were left waiting in the skybar for a menu for a good 40 minutes, before going to grab a waitress ourselves, who proceeded to ask \"where'd we come from?!\". Hardly the height of efficiency. The rest of the time, you went mostly unacknowledged. We're not prudes by any stretch of the imagination - we were in Toronto to catch some gigs and do some record shopping, we're early 30s, we love staying at the Pellirocco in Brighton (which the Drake appears to have some incredibly similar ideas as - the pleasure menu, the design hotel element, etc). We've stayed at the Roosevelt in LA which has a reputation for being loud loud loud party hotel and loved it, but it also has something that the Drake is seriously lacking - soundproofing in the rooms. I guess the main problem with the Drake is that it doesn't know whether it's a hotel, a bar, or a venue, and it really needs to make up it's mind, because right now, it's failing as a hotel. My advice? Go to the Drake for a drink or to catch a show in the Underground, and imagine how nice it might've been to stay here, but save your money and have a more comfortable and pleasant stay somewhere else instead.", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cTIFF at the Drake\u201d", "Author": "outrider", "ReviewID": "UR20471040", "Content": "I went with my film partner for this years Film Festival and he slected the Drake- I've traveled widely and stayed in many fine hotels but the Drake was a unique and deeply satsidfying experience.

The staff here is PHENOMENALLY helpful and friendly (great-looking, too!). I mentioned that I wanted to go sightseeing and snip-snap they printed Google maps of locations I wanted to see and highlighted my route for me. They helped me print & fax anytime needed. I went thrift store shopping, returned to the hotel with my haul and asked for directions to a laundromat -- their manager offered to take my laundry home & do it himself! I asked for recommendations of hair salons; they offered several and then mentioned that their cafe' manager cuts hair as well. The haircut she gave me is adorable (I'm not making this up)! The food is generally moderately priced, and totally delicious. Downstairs outdoor cafe' dining is balanced with a fun, funky lounge, a restaurant area, and an upstairs patio offering outdoor drinks & mingling. The Underground is a great space for music; a gilded proscenium arch framing the stage makes it resemble an old-school theatre. Great design here -- every space is packed with something fun and funky; what might have been a pommel horse in another life greets you when you come in the lobby, and beyond the reception area an antique photo booth anchors a guest seating area. The hotel seems to be a hangout for Toronto folks as well as a draw for travelers. The Drake's renovation was apparently one of the anchors that drove the West Queen West renaissance in recent years. A few notes -- We stayed in one of the crashpad rooms, which were small (though their small space design solutions have a hip, clean minimalist Japanese aesthetic). Wireless in our room at the far end of the third floor crashpads required a lot of network surfing to stay connected, but elsewhere in the hotel fellow conference attendees had blazingly fast and reliable connections in their rooms, so might just need another wireless booster down this end. Finally, there's no lift / elevator, an issue for the differently abled.

It was an amazing experience. I stayed for the weekend and the hotel is so retro fun! I loooved it! I had dinner in the dining room and the service was amazing, and the food was incredible. Chef Anthony Rose really had a flare for his cuisine. I ended up staying after dinner and having a few cocktails on the Sky Yard then heading back to my room. The entire staff was so helpful and the building was immaculate. I would recommend this venue as a great place to stay while visiting Toronto. The whole Queen West area is so safe and there is so many interesting shops and cute bars.

As a first \"snap shot\" of Toronto is was a great starting point. The area is superb, probably the coolest part of Toronto - though i suppose we all have different cool-ometers! bars, restaurants, Trinity Bellwoods park, lots of shopping - it's all there. China town is a 20 minute walk as is Kensington if you are into a taste of Mexico and loads of second hand clothing stores. The experience at the drake could not have been topped. We stayed five nights and were gutted to leave. I think the hotel concept rocks - GREAT decor, amazing staff, cafe, roof top bar, lounge, bar, restaurant, club - all under one roof - all very arty and cultured in my opinion, complete with an artist in residence. Their finger is on the pulse and lots are seeming to follow. We were there on business producing an event called Shoot Toronto.. We ate breakfast at the hotel cafe every morning, used the free WIFI access to death - generally spent a lot of time in the cafe outside on the veranda - there was a heat wave that weekend... This hotel is for the hip and not the hip replacements. I can't wait to go back.

What he didn't mention is the beer deliveries that commence each morning. Each keg as it is delivered at about 8 am is slammed onto the sideway. The finale is the noise as the empty beer bottles are sent dwon a conveyer to be loaded onto the truck. All this at about 8am. The design of the room was brilliant and unique. The sheets nice, mattress could have been better. The service was spotty. Some were pleasant and helpful at the front desk, some had an attitude - I think it is a age issue - all of them pretty young. There is no help in to the front door even if you are struggling with two back and opening the door. I think they must be amused to watch. No bell man. Though they did find me help to get my bags up the stairs. Though I was on my own on the way out. No elevator. I thought the location to be a bit out of the way in terms of downtown. There is a street car stop that makes it easier but if you just like to walk like I do - it is a hike. The cafe was great - I enjoyed the yougart, fruit and granola dish. Lots of locals like it as there hangout. I wasn't too disturb by the evening activities but i see how some unexpecting guests would be. There are three bars and they are very well known. Noise wasn't too bad the days I was there. Definite a place to stay at least once but for the price they charge I expect better service and attention and afternoon beer deliveries.", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Drake Hotel Toronto", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d496106-Reviews-Drake_Hotel_Toronto-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$199 - $238*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1150 Queen Street West</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M6J 1J3</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "496106", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ea/f0/eaf085b6b73e39209806bf2b50125b6a4large.jpg"}}
