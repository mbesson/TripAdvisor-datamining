{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Hotel - loved it! We were in China visiting Beijing, then Shanghai for a holiday trip. The stay at the Intercontinental was from 1st Jan to 4th Jan. Location wise - it was in the financial district. We were there during Yuan Dan (which is New Year day and it was public holidays for a few days in China). Hence, we did not encounter very bad traffic jams. The metro is around 5-10 minutes walk away and is an ok way to get around. But, I can imagine it is difficult to get to and away from the hotel during peak hours as we experienced on our last day of stay. The area around the hotel had heavy traffic. It is not walkable to the various tourist spots and hence, would suggest to take the taxi or the metro.The room was very good. It was huge with a spacious bathroom. Bathroom is nicely fitted with a lovely long bath which was very inviting. Likewise, the bed was fabulous with nice linen as well. Only grouse is the tv is not the plasma tv for the room we stayed in.The gym was well-equipped and spacious and was open 24 hours. The spa was quite good as well and opened til midnight. Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, a very enjoyable stay in a beautiful city.I think that it would be a good hotel to stay in over weekends/public holidays or if you do not need to travel to / from the hotel during the peak hours.", "Date": "Jan 11, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR557176958", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Annil_t"}, {"Content": "Loved it!!!!! My favorite hotel!I was staying at a local 3 star hotel for $90 which had a makeshift gym in a room, no pool, below average service etc. and decided to check out early and treat myself to the Intercontinental. The Intercontinental was on a completely different level of class and service. The check in lady was a foreigner (think Russian) and was soooo nice and helpful. The bell boy was so nice and remembered my name. The hotel is beautiful. The gym is huge and new and has everything. Pool is nice. Locker room is immaculate and has a nice jacuzzi, sauna and steam. It was so quiet.Free internet. I think it is very classy when a hotel does not charge for internet. Breakfast was great and included in the price. Room was beautiful and big and you are greated with soft music as you enter. The dinner buffet (separate charge) was worth the western prices. I was planning on just staying one night to treat myself but after realizing it was actually a few dollars cheaper than a 3 star hotel which charges you extra for everthing I stayed the rest of my trip here. After spending your day touring the city with the crowds and difficulty in language it is so nice to come back to the Intercontinental where it is quiet and beautiful and everyone speaks great english.The only negative is that it is in the finance area and a little far to walk to places but the taxis are plentiful and cheap.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR744042148", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "dragonogard"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel This is a great hotel. I stayed in a grand deluxe room, which was very nice and had a huge bath. The hotel is conviniently located, about a 10 minute walk to a subway stop, but taxis are very cheap.The only downside were their high prices.

Room very spacious and clean and certainly to a 5 star level. Hotel staff very efficient and friendly.Close to a subway line which can take you to major tourist sites. Subway is almost always crowded but very cheap at about 3rmb per one way ticket. Taxis very cheap ( about 30 rmb to Tian'anmen Square from hotel) and the easiest way to get around. I would highly recommend this hotel. Smoking rooms are more common in China so do make it very clear that you want non smoking and it may pay you to email the hotel as well directly just to remind them of this requirement if non smoking is important to you.", "Date": "Nov 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR669129468", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PlatinumNZ"}, {"Content": "First rate hotel but no taxis available This is a first class hotel and clearly a 5-star. The rooms are great and the facilities are as good as it gets. This is a very quiet area but there are a number of western restaurants and fast food joints in the area including Starbucks.There was some big problems in checking-in but the manager who goes by the english name of Carmen was very pleasant and did a great job so I was able to keep my cool though all this.One problem with this hotel is the lack of taxis. In a few occasion we had to wait a long time, even returned to sit in the lobby until one taxi arrive. I was a little more stressed when I had to leave for the airport and there was someone else also waiting. Essentially the hotel staff does nothing to fetch a taxi, just wait for one to drop a guest. In contrast just next block, at the Westin, ever time I walked by , there were 10 taxis waiting in line. One final comment. I booked though the chain's website. They have an internet lowest price guarantee but i have found it impossible to get them to respect this even when I proved a lower price was available on the internet.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR110074348", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JPDeM"}, {"Content": "Quiet Oasis in the Financial District I just stayed 4 days at the Intercontinental on Financial Street (Sept 08). I stayed in a Capital Suite, with Club Level privileges. The hotel is a contemporary styled hotel with an intimate, rather than large lobby, and you get a more relaxed and friendly feel. Everyone knew my name and made me feel welcome. My suite was extremely large, with a completely separate living room, with couch, chairs and coffee table on one side, desk on the other, with a full view towards the city. I used it several times for business meetings with 3-5 guests and everyone was every comfortable. It has a separate minibar, with large flat screen TV (DVD player included) above. There is a separate entry way, and door to the bedroom and bathroom areas. A modern bathroom is separate from the bedroom with separate toilette and shower areas (incredible multi-head and rain options) and two separately spaced sinks, with a large view of the city (electric shutters). Bedroom was spacious, great comfortable bed, pillows and furnishings (and another desk, lounge chair etc). The hotel was quiet and I never heard any street or hotel noise. I felt that the staff truly went out there way, in everyway, to accommodate and make my stay perfect. I had one small issue and a language problem and you would have thought the world had stopped, as the assistant manager and others made sure that I was completely satisfied. The management takes even the smallest issues very seriously. There is an adequate workout room with all new lifecycle elliptical and cycling trainers and treadmills, and weights and machines. Pool area is great and all impeccably clean. I tried the Monsoon Restaurant for lunch and the buffet, with cold seafood and sushi on one side, and hot food, French desserts on the other was really top notch, and delivered like an upscale stand alone restaurant. The Club Level breakfast was excellent with a great working espresso/cappuccino machine, great fusion inspired snacks and major well brand alcohols for happy hour. Also, I had free internet service. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone having business in the financial district or for those who want a more relaxing top quality hotel. I will definitely be back here next time in Beijing.", "Date": "Sep 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR359978705", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MaitreGeorgia"}, {"Content": "Very nice hotel This hotel lives up to the standards of other Incontinentals where I've stayed, with some minor issues. It's modern and clean, and the service is doting. I wasn't thrilled with the food in the lobby restaurants, and they mixed up my order the first time (no doubt due to simple language issues). My room was very nice, and room service was just fine. There's a Starbucks just opposite the main entrance for those needing a fix of something familiar. I didn't take any walks from the hotel, but I had the impression it's well-situated and not impossibly far from Tianamen Square by foot.I was slightly annoyed not to be able to take a western newspaper in the lobby for free (just bump up the room rate by a dollar or two), and then slightly more annoyed when I found out I couldn't just charge it to my room. These can only be described as luxury problems.Breakfast was very good (omelettes to order, etc) and served in a nice setting.", "Date": "Sep 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR117901645", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "thielees"}, {"Content": "Exhuberated a fresh and modern feel, with some small operational issues Intercontinental Financial Street has a fresh feel to it, having undergone extensive refurbishment in the run-up to the Olympics. The property is situated in a purpose planned financial district with mainly large office buildings (with proximity to our office being the main reason for choosing the hotel).The restaurant serves excellent food in an open-plan, modern setting. I can also highly recommend the breakfast buffet which offers a wide array of cuisine from continental to traditional Chinese food for a reasonable price.The standard guest room is spacious, with all the expected modern amenities (LCD TV, contemporary furniture, internet access) and a very compelling bathroom design.One small concern is that they still haven't fully taken care of all the issues that occur during a refurbishment. There was an annoying water leak by the bathtub which disturbs ones sleep, and a colleague spoke of problems with the toilet so seems to be a consistent issue they are yet to resolve.On a general note a pleasant and nice alternative for luxury accommodation in Beijing.", "Date": "Sep 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR168279001", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Bharell_Jackson"}, {"Content": "Beijing Olympic home - great place to stay I recently spent 17 nights at the Intercontinental Financial Street to attend the Beijing Olympic Games. You would think that with all the activities surrounding an Olympic Games, any hotel would have a major challenge in taking care of its guests. The Intercontinental's problems were magnified by the fact that USA Basketball (yes, that includes both the men's and women's basketball teams and all their supporting staff), were also in the hotel, making it a mini-Olympic Village. Nevertheless, the hotel managed to be both a great retreat from the frenetic activities of the Olympics and a bit of an oasis from the heat of a Beijing summer. Every member of the staff was smiling, pleasant, and could not be more helpful. The head concierge as well as a young Hawaiian-American manager were particularly helpful, whether in getting a taxi or making dinner reservations, even in the middle of the Olympics (and at the best restaurants in Beijing). The laundry service was efficient and relatively inexpensive for a hotel, and the rooms very modern and luxuriously comfortable. The Monsoon Restaurant was great for late lunches or early dinners to accommodate an Olympic schedule, and the Steak Exchange was a wonderful (if pricey) steakhouse and bar. If this hotel can perform like this during an Olympic Games, I can't wait to try it during a somewhat more quiet time. Highly, highly recommended. And it is not nearly so far out of the way as it would seem, 15-20 minutes by taxi to almost anywhere in the CBD.", "Date": "Sep 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR307224803", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ajgeb"}, {"Content": "Great service!
