Room keys: They can't provide double occupants with more than one key. This makes things rather awkward. Wifi: Continuously had wifi issues. Price: This place is somewhat overpriced IMHO (though most hotels in Istanbul are). Location: Not horribly off the beaten bath (7-10 minutes walking uphill to get to the Blue Mosque & Haggia Sophia) but not exactly central (I also got lost a number of times returning even though I rarely got lost otherwise in all of Istanbul).

The rooms were quite small with twin beds rather than double which I find rather irritating when you book a double, but both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean - a powerful shower which I always welcome. We did have to ask to change room after the first night however. The proximity to the train line is well documented in the other reviews, but nobody appears to have been bothered by the AC units placed outside of the windows on one side of the hotel. The noise was unbearable - so much so that my boyfriend said he welcomed the sounds of the passing trains during the night as it momentarily drowned out the AC units! The second room was much better - still noisy due to train line but no AC units. The staff were generally very helpful, but I am still at a loss as to why one member of staff on Reception informed us on Saturday morning that the Grand Bazaar was closed that day and we should go the next day instead. He suggested he book us on a tour of the Bosphorus instead. Being a rather cynical person by nature and suspecting this to be a sales ploy, I didn't believe him so we went and spent a lovely day at the very open Grand Bazaar. Had we believed him and gone the next day (Sunday), we would have found the Bazaar very much closed.

The Tram Station and Sightseeing tour bus terminal is right in front of the Blue Mosque. There is also a mid-size Bazaar by the Blue Mosque.

This was a belated 25th anniversary present for my wife and our stay at the hotel made it a trip to remember. Staff were extremely friendly and very helpful, both Ercan and Orcan who manage the reception cannot be praised enough for ensuring that our stay at the antis always remains unforgettable. The first day we got there we were told that not wanting to spoil our holiday due to only a small room being available they asked us to transfer to another hotel for the first night only and a more suitable room would be prepared for us the following day, I suspect this was more to do with a double booking rather than the reason cited, however not to be undone we accepted on the premise as stated. The hotel arranged was a quaint boutique hotel which again didn't disappoint. Both Orcan and Ercan were true to their word as the following day we returned to the antis as booked and a more suitable room is an understatement, to our surprise we were given the deluxe suite on the roof - grrreat. Complimentary wifi accessed from the in room computer, ensuite jacuzzi bathroom, TV, wopping kingsize bed and a great sea view. Buffet breakfast with a reasonable choice of fruits, nuts, yoghurt, hot food, (boiled eggs, scrabmled eggs) breads and cereals with coffee and juices was more than sufficient to sustain us for the site seeing ahead. The view from the terrace accessed from walking out from our room cannot be beaten, the sea on one side and the blue mosque on the other!! Apart from the hotel itself the key aspect is its perfect location, just 5 mins walk to all the main sites of Istanbul, Blue mosque, Aya sofia, Topkapi palace etc, cannot be beaten. I know many visitors make reference to the train tracks directly behind the hotel, but believe me this is a minor distraction as the views from the terrace, the location and the satff more than make up for this especially if you are looking to take full advantage of your time in istanbul to see the sites. My thanks to all the staff and Mr sirdar Gemal the manager for making our stay the perfect holiday and leaving a lasting memory of Istanbul that will always be just that unforgettable.

So be careful - no protection here. 3) What makes this hotel particularly bad is that they did not admit that they failed to provide the facilities that were paid for - without this, it was impossible to enter into a dialogue to improve the situation. For those who may not be familiar with Turkey, there was no language barrier. They simply found it easier to hide behind their perfectly competent grasp of english. 4) When asked via lastminute about this issue - they said a) that they had showed us multiple rooms (this is true, the other room they showed us was a standard double, which did not fit the bill either) and b) they did not take the money for the sea view room - true, we paid via lastminute - they simply avoided answering the questions put to them.

We travelled from Sabiha which is further from Sultanahmet and got a coach/bus from outside the airport for 12 Lira each to Taksim square. At Taksim square we queued up at a little box where they sell a bus card called a Akbil card, it cost 5 Lira per person and you can get a bus \"61 B\" from Taksim to Sultanahmet or ask the man who sells the tickets for X amount of tickets to sultanahmet and which bus to take. Make sure to ask the driver to let you know when you get to SultanAhmet. When you get to Sultanahmet you need to identify the tram tracks in the middle of the road and follow it down the hill you should see McDonalds on the right and after McDonalds there is a restaurant on the Corner Called \"Baran\". Keep on the same side of the road as the restaurant and walk down past the tram stop. There is a mosque on the right after the tram stop and if you take a little right from the mosque you will see an area where there are wooden benches to sit if you cary on walking you will come to a small fountain which has stairs next to it with water flowing down on the side of the stairs. After the stairs there is an open area and you should see to your right the tall obelisk but dont walk towards the obelisk instead keep walking to the left towards another fountain which is further up on the left. To the right of the fountain you will see a lot of wooden benches from where you can see the famous blue mosque on your right. Next to these benches you will see green areas and an italian garden sort of thing which has benches and creeper plants on your right. behind this garden to the back of the mosque there is the ARASTA bazaar. Ask the locals and they will know where you have to go. Walk down the stairs and take a left and walk through. On the left is a big open cafe/restaurant and on the right is a small shop where you can buy drinks/food etc. After this there is a road, cross over and continue to walk down till the next road and take a right. Keep walking to the end of the street till you see a little corner shop at the end on the left. If you look up you will see Antis Hotel infront on your right. So sorry for the long winded explanation but we walked for over an hour an a half till we found it and thought it might be useful if we direct you there before you get there. Definitely take the Bosphorous Cruise which costs about 70-80 Lira per person. Ask the local shops and they should be able to sort it out for you. We recommend the afternoon cruise as you will get plenty of sun and a lot to see. It lasts 5 hours. Eat loads before or take snacks. Also book a shuttle transfer from the local shops to the airport on departure which is much more comfortable and stress free, it costs about 25-30 Lira per person and can pick you up from either your hotel or the shop next to it. I hope this is sufficient. Beware that although Antis is 4* on most websites do not compare it to UK/US 4*. I think it was great as we only really slept there but the beds were very comfortable and cleaned every day. Irons are available, A/C, safe deposit box and Powershowers which are Grrrreat. Make sure to spend time on the roof terrace on the 4th floor as it has great views of the Bosphorous sea and the Blue Mosque. Apart from that everything is right there next to the Hotel. go to the Grand Bazaar and Haggle. And I means loads. We paid 70% Less than asking price on most items so make sure you try and get the best deal. Also check out the Apple tea at the local restaurants or street vendors - its great! Get prices for cetain items from shops before buying at the grand bazaar as some items are actually cheaper in the shops. Big bottles of water are 1 Lira and small bottles are half Lira!!! Cheap! But buy water from shops not street vendors etc. The Hotel is near a train line so request a room further away from the track, although there are no trains at night and early morning you wont notice them much, We requested a room on the other side of the hotel and the next day we got one. Thats all for now. Go to Istanbul and enjoy!

As the flights (if booked alone) cost nearly that per person it seemed like a good deal! I arranged the free airport transfer by email and the Hotel Antis reception team were very responsive and indeed there was a driver waiting for us (and 2 other guests on same flight) despite a delay getting though visa and passports (2 separate queues!). On arrival we were warmly greeted by Okan (Gohkan) the hotel manager and his staff. Turkish tea was served. When taken to our room though I was dismayed to see it seemed to be a standard twin room on the second floor. When I politely challenged Okan that I had paid extra for a 'super deluxe double room' he said that one was not available but he could put us in a better room the next day. He also moved us to a slightly larger double room on the second floor that day. The standard rooms do seem to be perfectly nice though and bigger than your average Istanbul old city hotel room. The next morning (after a nice breakfast by Turkish hotel standards - good bread and coffee) Okan stuck to his word and moved us to the top (and only) suite on the 4th floor which opens out to the roof terrace. This was a very nice spacious room with great views over the sea. We had a free to use PC in our room and there is one in the lobby as well. We were able to check in for our return leg and Okan kindly printed the boarding passes for us. The roof terrace is very nice and tidy although staff are not often up there but you can easily arrange to have drinks or breakfast brought up (polite to give tip of course). The staff in general were very friendly and Okan especially was most helpful despite the initial booking issue. Now the big issue some people have had is with the TRAINS. Even on the top floor you cannot escape them. They ran with differing frequency (roughly every 10 minutes, longer in evenings) and some were quite quiet and others louder! We actually found the noise perfectly tolerable and even meditative and the other bonus is that when there are no trains it is very quiet with no cars honking horns or rumbling past on the cobbled streets (although the area around the hotels not nearly as busy as other areas of Sultanhamet). If worried, I would insist on a room WITHOUT a sea view as in that way your room will be facing the city side with a small street in front but with no view. The hotel is well placed on the edge of the busier old town area but still within easy 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque and Hagias Sofia. We also walked to the remains of the impressive aqueduct and the S\u00c3\u00bcleymaniye Mosque (better inside than the Blue Mosque we thought) and down to Eminonou to get ferries to the Asian side and up the Bosporus. The tram (1.75TL) was also useful for getting back when our legs had given out. Okan gave a good tip, get the tram to last stop on the line and then the fenicluar up to Taksim square. Then you can take a longish leisurely walk back via the Gelata tower and bridge -seeing the more modern 'normal' Beyoglu area of Istanbul on the way. All food whether street stall or restaurant was excellent, I personally would recommend the Yumer and Dulmer ( I think) more unusual type kebabs when grabbing a quick lunch on foot or of course the famous fried fish and bread widely available near the ferries. Would also recommend getting some Mehanes (Turkish Meze) in one of the places on Nevizade Street near Taksim square. We also had several excellent meals in the many nearby restaurants but our favourite (for the view alone) was the Seven Hills roof terrace restaurant. The food was a little pricy for what you got but the views of the Blue Mosque and Hagias Sofia nearby by twilight were simply unforgettable in the warm evening air! I would also recommend for any blokes getting a Turkish shave at the many barbers for 10TL, meticulously done plus ear hairs waxed or burnt away! We also had a Turkish bath and massage at the ancient Gedikpasa hamam which was arranged by the hotel reception for 55TL per person with free car transfer. This was a good price and it is one of the most authentic baths in town, built in 1457. I was the only non local in the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s section and it was like something from Midnight Express but all the more an experience for it!

Normally one might consider this an issue, but we had no problem with this. After all, we were in Europe/Middle East, and these issues should be expected. The view and the location exceeded our expectation and overshadowed any downsides. There are plenty of great places to eat in the area. There is a great convenience store across the street to buy water (1 TL), soda, and snacks. Up the hill and around the corner were the Blue Mosque an Hagia Sofia. This made getting a taxi easy, and when we needed to return, we just told them to drop us off by the Blue Mosque. The area is hilly and the hotel is near the bottom of the hill. So there was plenty of uphill walking, but you get your exercise. The roof top of the hotel has a terrace that has a great view of the Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorus. There is an area that is enclosed with a tent structure to shelter you from wind and sun. If you want a drink, there is a bar, but you need to warn the front desk, so they will visit the roof on occasion to help you, The staff was hospital and courteous.

This information extended to day trips available within Istanbul and also outside the city, and also suggestions for evening entertainment and places to eat. The room itself (a twin) was a decent size, with fresh d\u00c3\u00a9cor and good en suite facilities. The beds were very comfortable and the room was equipped with a safe, TV and tea-making facilities. Free wi-fi is available in the rooms and throughout the hotel, Gavin just gave us the access code after we checked in. We were aware of trains passing by every so often, but not to the point where it kept us awake or bothered us at all since we were on the opposite side of the hotel. If we had been in a room closer to the train track it may have been more of an issue. Breakfast provided a good range of options: cold meats, cheeses, breads and pancakes as well as hot items such as scrambled or boiled eggs, sausage and potatoes. All of this was included in the room rate but there were additional items available to order on demand at a small cost. Although the weather was too cold when we visited to really spend a lot of time up on the roof, there is a lovely terrace there with either sea views to the south or to the Blue Mosque to the north. Well worth going up there at night to get a great picture of the Mosque all lit up! All in all we had an enjoyable stay and were glad that we chose Antis Hotel.

We asked again, and were told it would be brought up in an hour as it was heavy (although they have a lift?!). True to their word, we got a bed after an hour but we were not given a duvet for another hour (which had no cover) and then at about half 2 in the morning a rude member of staff nearly knocked down the door with thumping trying to give us our bed sheets?! Despite this, we enjoyed the buffet breakfast provided every morning which was fresh and delicious with attentive waiting staff. However, another blow to add to an unfortunate start was when it came to us checking out.

Please check if I have a reservation on my name and then check the details about the price.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This price it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a joke. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have your reservation and there it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing form me to check\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The price it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my problem, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your mistake if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not ok. Please talk to your boss to solve this problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to give you explanations, I have customers to take care of.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And then he ignored us and treated other customers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Meanwhile I have called the customer service number from the site I have made my reservation. I friendly girl answered me and listened me all the way about my problem. Let me tell you that I have made this reservation 5 months before, so if there was a problem with the price or the reservation they had all the time in the world to let me know and correct the mistake. The girl called at the reception and talked with the guy (the rode one). After talking with her he has changed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a money problem anymore, he said the hotel it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fully booked. After another conversation with the girl form out booking site he said he can offer us a room at another hotel nearby. We said ok, if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same price and the same conditions that we were expecting. He asked another guy to take us there, we saw the Hotel, it was ok for us and checked in. We went out in the city since it was our last day in Istanbul and we had already lost a loot of time. In the afternoon when we came to the Hotel offered to us as an alternative, the guy at the reception apologized and said that the Antis Hotel has a free room and we have to go there. He apologized again and offered to help us moving our luggage from a place to another. We arrived at Antis again: Me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So, where are you sending us this time?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nowhere, I have a free room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But a couple of hours ago it was all booked. What happened? He: mourned something that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give you your room card\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gave us the card and that was the last thing we have spoke with him. I have left my feedback at the reception. I would recommend this hotel because it was very beautiful despite the treatment we received (the treatment it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that can be changed).

The location is excellent, only a short stroll from the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Topkapi and the Cistern. There is a tram stop near the mosque which will take you to the spice bazaar, grand bazaar and over the water. So perfect location. There is also a roof terrace with great views of the Mosque one one side and the bospherous on the other. On the streets near the hotel there are some lovely restaurants and recommend trying these - it has a real resort feel about it (rather than inner city). The rooms are decorated in a very sumptious fashion and are comfortable. The only disappointment here was that there was a single wardrobe with a few hangers and there were no drawers anywhere. As a result we lived out of a suitcase - not ideal. Breakfast was average - whilst i will always eat the local specialities for lunch and dinner, i'm quite traditional at breakfast and like cereal, fruit, bread and the occasional fry up. The bread was amazing - so fresh, and there was a good selection of meats and cheeses, but limited fruit, juices, cereal and hot food. Service at breakfast was a little bit slow (getting tables cleared, replenishing buffet etc). Service on the whole was very good - receptionist friendly and informative, and staff taking bags to room, serving drinks etc also very friendly. Other guests have mentioned the noise from the train - our room was quite close to the train line and whilst you can hear it it didnt keep us awake as the double glazing is very effective. One other note of caution, they were in the final stages of building small bar/nightclub opposite the hotel as we were leaving. I imagine that with the nightclub sound proofing and the good double glazing that this shouldnt cause too many problems but keep in mind if you are a light sleeper.

This was the first time that I had ever booked a hotel directly with the hotel via emails and I had prepared myself to be disappointed but this was certainly not the case. After a bit of initial trouble in locating the hotel (the driver spent ages just driving up and down the side streets in sultanahmet even though I kept trying to point out that the hotel's phone number was on my email confirmation!) which was due to the hotel being so new that not all the regular shuttle/taxi drivers had heard of it, we were pleasantely greeted by staff who made checking in a smooth process. We were even welcomed with turkish tea. We changed rooms after one night as we wanted a double room rather than the twin room that we had been given and staff helped us move our belongings from one room to another. Room 107 is by a train track but this never bothered us as it seemed to be used infrequently. The decor was ottaman influenced but modern and airy. The rooms were very clean, with powerful air con and mini bars that we used to store our own drinks in (the chambermaids didn't seem to object to this). The rooms were smaller than they looked on the website but we weren't in the room that much anyway. Breakfast was okay, I didn't really take to the turkish style of breakfast so it would not be a fair critique if I commented on it but my only comment would be that the 'fuit ' juice could have been chilled and perhaps some crossaints/pastries also available for those who didn't want to eat traditional turkish food for breakfast. Staff were friendly and extremely helpful, they are definetely the all important ingredient to this hotel and I would recommend a stay here to anyone. the location is fantastic, close to all the major sights and has a small corner shop just around the corner.
