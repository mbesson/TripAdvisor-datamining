I am not a guest of the hotel, but now never will be - I was politely asking whether I could book a water taxi to pick up from here in the morning, but was told that since I wasn't a guest, I could basically get stuffed. Classy. It's ok to say no, or I don't know, but to be told to get lost by a hotel management is the pits. There are plenty of great places to stay in Venice, and some great people too, so my advice would be is that if is house they treat visitors, go anywhere else.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA warm welcome to Venice\u201d", "Author": "Unexpectedtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR106450261", "Content": "I had to make an unexpected emergency trip to Venice to assist a sick relative so I was under significant stress.

At first i thought \u00e2\u201a\u00ac120 a night for the room was too pricey, but for Venice and for the location, i realised afterwards that it was quite a good deal. We had the romantic, old fashioned room overlooking the canal (see hotel's photos). It was like staying in a museum (in a positive way). You had the lovely feeling that you were in Venice 200 years ago. If you stay here, you must have this room! The downside was that gaps in the door and windows meant that you did hear people talking and walking outside the hotel (in the streets) and in the corridor(inside the hotel). However, it didn't ruin the stay, we were there for sightseeing, not sleeping. If you need a 10 hour sleep, dont stay here. I read the other reviews on Trip Advisor and can only conclude that they have changed the staff. They were lovely and friendly, even the lady that couldn't speak english well, made a real effort and was so apologetic that her english wasn't so good. The Filipino guy on night duty was also happy and helpful, always smiling and cheerful when he let you in at night (they lock the doors after a certain time). Breakfast was simple, but the non english speaking waitress was also great - so, no complaints at all on the staff. The hotel is a bit dated and tired, but we loved it.. It oozed Venetian charm.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens", "Title": "\u201cVery Rude Personnel\u201d", "Author": "elpidoforos", "ReviewID": "UR28862100", "Content": "Asked the hotel's reception for information in a rainy day and they wouldn't even bother to look at me - avoid this hotel!", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales/England", "Title": "\u201cLovely comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "Miffed-from-West-Mid", "ReviewID": "UR19153748", "Content": "Lovely hotel.

It is about 50 meters from the local 'bus stop S Angelo' the one after the Rialto and the water bus from the airport will take you directly to the stop make sure you get the right one as there are at least 2 and they do not go to all stops. We had room 7 which seemed to be the one to go for as it is large and has a balcony looking over a canal and good air conditioning. The breakfast is basic but adequate - cereal, yoghurt bread ham and cheese It is about 10 minutes to St Marks square and also to the Rialto bridge. There are 3 restaurants which are good within 5 minutes. No English channnel on the TV.
