I had a room big enough for two small beds and the air conditioner worked great. Bathroom was nicely remodeled. Hotel Gold is located within 5 minutes of subway and lots of places to eat.

It's not that far from the city centre by MRT which is ten minutes by foot from the hotel. There are numerous food corners in the area where you can eat a tasty dinner for S$4. Well, it's Geylang - a bustling and lively neighborhood which streets are alive almost 24 hours a day. It's a red light district but you shouldn't be afraid - it's very safe at any time of day or night, much more safer than any big US/European city even in the bright day. The only reason you might want avoid this area is if you are offended seeing working girls (or for the same reason - if you're traveling with children). The room is very small, not much space besides bed. No fridge which is a big disadvantage considering temperatures (I mean the aircon is very efficient so it's not like there's hot in the room - but you really enjoy a cold drink in Singapore at any the of day and night)! Well, this is a budget hotel and one of the cheapest in Singapore - you can't have high expectations. Don't push the lock button from the inside if you're leaving the room (what is a common practice in many hotel locks) - if you push it you won't be able to open the door from outside, it's mean to use from inside only. The reception staff is very nice and helpful though and they send someone within two minutes after I reported a problem with getting to my room - the man who came had master key and simply opened the door for me. Even if the hotel is a budget one, the service is good and the room is cleaned well and fresh towels delivered during your stay (not that obvious standard in very cheap hotels).", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cGood for backpackers\u201d", "Author": "mooordek", "ReviewID": "UR124057015", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel 81 for 2 nights.

We leave early in the morning and came back at night and couple times saw a group of escort ladies near the hotel, but it's not a problem at all. They won't disturb you when you act and walk normally. The hotel is only 10 mnts from MRT station so it's very easy to go everywhere. It's also quite near to city center and taxi will only cost you around SGD 8-10.
