However, I have to disagree with many of the reviews. The only caveat that I give would be that perhaps I did not travel at the time of some of these problems. Additionally, the Turks are not necessarily known for customer service. As a result, I do not think any review that attempts to discount this hotel due to customer service should not be fully trusted. If one thinks that American or even Western European customer service exists in Istanbul, then they are sadly mistaken. The Good: I was very surprised by the cleanliness of the hotel lobby and the hotel itself. The pool was very small, but very nice. The \"Secret Garden\" as it was called by the hotel was very nice for a drink or hookah. The restaurant was very good, having a wide selection to choose from at dinner. We ate here 2 different days and the main course was very different each day. Free WiFi in the lobby was also a plus. Great location, only 10 minutes from some restaurants and shopping. 20-25 minutes to the main cultural areas of the Old Town. The Bad: Small rooms for singles. My other group members had bigger rooms with double beds, but be careful if you are a single traveler or if you book a double, it may be very small. The bathrooms needs some cleaning and updating. The Ugly: The mattresses were not very soft and the karaoke lady singing at 1a was not fun. I would stay here again if I had to, but with so many choices I would look around.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cthe mix between 4* & 3*\u201d", "Author": "esham83", "ReviewID": "UR114770789", "Content": "this hotel contains deluxe & standard rooms so when i entered this hotel i believed its 4* hotel very nice lobby very nice swimming pool but small but when i entered the room i disappointed the bed was not clean small window with ruins view but the room is wide enough breakfast is different & rich belong again to 4* staff are helpful but one of them is very rude he made me felt that i'm a prisoner not a tourist Tv is really bad & without remote control Ac is very strong this hotel should 've different prices one for standard & other for deluxe", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pristina, Kosovo", "Title": "\u201cNot a good place to be....\u201d", "Author": "kasiopi", "ReviewID": "UR113211355", "Content": "I have been in this hotel in April 2011.I was surprised when I saw the differences between reality and what was served on the web site.

Automatically I went into the shower, but upon finishing with my ablutions found that what I thought was a towel on the towel rack was in fact the floor mat. Needless to say I had to use it to dry off as there was nothing else in the bathroom to use. I called the front desk to complain about the lack of towels and was reluctantly told that there would be someone there in a minute with fresh towels. As I left the room an hour later, there were still no towels. I mentioned this to the front desk as I left. Upon my return I noted that there were indeed what appeared to be towels hanging on the towel reck. Upon closer inspection I found that I now had two floor mats. Contacting the front desk again I asked for towels. An hour later when none were delivered I walked to the front desk and was told \"Sorry sir, we are temporarily out of clean towels. We will send some to your room as soon as they are available.\" The next morning as I dried myself again on a floor mat I vowed never to return to this hotel. It was hot in the rooms, with no control other than opening a window which opened out to a loud loading dock for a company next door.
