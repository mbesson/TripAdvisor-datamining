We (my 17 year old son and I) found this hotel to suit our needs perfectly. It is close to UCLA campus, which we were visiting and walking distance to many shops, cafes, restaurantsand even the Hammer Museum. The location is very upscale and absolutely safe (I don't understand why other reviewers doubted the safety of the location). The rooms suggest that this hotel is a converted apartment building since they are somewhat odd shapes. Ours was very large, had wonderful windows overlooking a very small interior yard (\"garden\" would be a stretch). Everything was clean, albeit there were some stains in the bathroom (as most budget hotels have). Air conditioner worked well, although we preferred having the windows open. I don't think there is a restaurant in this hotel, but many cafes nearby. We did not find overnight parking to be a problem, but we noticed that there are some daytime parking restrictions. One of the shining stars was the staff. they were very friendly, did everything to make our stay more enjoyable; gave good information about parking and great directions to every where we wanted to go.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cAffordable Westwood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rendar", "ReviewID": "UR114991710", "Content": "The Claremont Hotel is an ideal stop for anyone looking for an affordable hotel option in Westwood. It is extremely close to UCLA campus and is near the various things going on in Westood Village. I stayed here for a few days in spring 2011 while visiting UCLA and checking out the area. Is it luxury? No. However, it is affordable and isn't a complete dump like many other budget hotels can be. The fantastic price comes with extremely basic rooms. They're certainly homey in that \"Mom's decorations from the 1950s\" sort of way and aren't 1970s/80s ugly. The biggest downfall are the mattresses which could definitely use some replacement (at least in my room). However, everything is kept clean and tidy. The only bathroom amenity is soap kept in a dispenser in the shower so be prepared with your own amenities if you want something more than bathroom hand soap. Towels and face cloths are taken care of by housekeeping. There are some nice areas to sit in the hotel's \"living room\" (for lack of a better word) and coffee room. However, if it's nice outside there's really no reason to stay in the hotel. I didn't bother with the wifi so I have no idea how the connection is. The same goes for parking as I had no car. The end story is that if you're looking for somewhere clean and reasonably comfy to crash for a few nights while at UCLA this is a great option.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, No-Frills Hotel\u201d", "Author": "TravelingE3", "ReviewID": "UR67947781", "Content": "This no-frills hotel has quiet rooms and is conveniently located to UCLA and Westwood's shops and restaurants. The furniture is old and in somewhat poor condition, but adequate. The staff members at the front desk are pleasant. This hotel provides basic accommodations for the budget traveler. If you are looking for in-room TV, in-room internet, free shampoo, or the other extras typically found in American hotels, however, you need to go elsewhere. Although the hotel does not offer food, it does have a refrigerator for guests to store food (for example, groceries from the nearby Trader Joe's). My window in my first-floor room was just a few inches above ground, and the screen was torn. If you want to leave your window open during the day, a room above the first floor would be safer. On the other hand, my room on the first floor got (weak) internet, whereas occupants in most of the hotel must go to the first-floor lounge to access the internet. I might stay here again, but I would probably spend a little extra to try the nicer hotel next door to this one.

Push button soap was available in the bathrrom and shower. I brought my own cosmetics, so it was not a problem that shampoo and conditioner were not provided.

No in-room TV (a good thing), computer, or shampoo; older bathroom and room, but kept clean by very friendly and efficient housekeeping staff. Looked like room and bathroom have been repainted and repaired. For food, Trader's Joe and Raley's are nearby and lots of good restaurants around such as Noodle Planet, one of our favorites. There is a microwave, fridge and free coffee and tea at the hotel for guest use. So if you don't mind a simple, old but relatively clean place with characters and be aware of a few things, you will be fine in a most welcoming place ran by friendly staff: Scott and Leon.

Personally, I have not experienced the peeling paint, unpleasant odors, or anything else of that nature. I have stayed at the Claremont on several different occasions. The only gripe I have is with those that are slamming this hotel for no justifiable reason. Not recommended for those that must have it all and don't want to pay for it.

I thought \"You have got to be KIDDING.\" As you have heard, the rooms have no televisions. The paint is peeling and the carpet is stained. One of the beds in my room was missing the headboard. The bathroom tile is extremely old. The soap comes from those soap dispensers you see in public restrooms. Make sure you bring your own shampoo, soap, etc., because they do not supply ANYTHING. When you flush the toilet, the pipes in the walls groan for a while. The walls are thin, so you can here everything your neighbor is doing (and I mean EVERYTHING). The door offers a lousy little push lock, with no bolt or chain. At least the water pressure is good, but it sprays like a high pressure hose, and feels like thousands of needles hitting your skin. Oh, and there wasn't nearly enough outlets in the room. I had to charge my laptop on the bathroom toilet because I didn't want to unplug the alarm clock. I have to say though, the location is GREAT. There is an endless amount of things to do. The neighborhood feels safe, with hundreds of UCLA students roaming around. There is an endless array of shops and restaurants. Everything you need is within walking distance. I barely spent any time in the room. As long as one doesn't plan on spending much time in the room, this hotel may actually be okay.

Our 2-double bed room was $79 a night in 2006 for 3 people and I would call it a $29 room in a $50 location. The furniture was old (original)...original OLD bath tiles & flooring...not an updated or renovated place by any means. No A/C but this is an area that gets SOME residual ocean breezes and is not as hot as Hollywood/L.A. If \"security\" is your issue, this little hotel really doesn't have any but there is 24 hour desk coverage at the entrance. Also, it's in a residential area with apts and people nearby so just a scream would be heard by hundreds. The Westwood area is safe round the clock with lots of students and residents roaming the streets, but like anywhere else you don't walk around screaming \"I'm a tourist see my fanny pack and diamond rings?\" Yes, there are a few homeless people around at times because they go wherever the crowds are, many movie theatres etc in the area attract crowds. Very safe area as L.A. goes but this is not Mayberry RFD There was bus service to anywhere we wanted to go right around the corner...$3 got us a daily bus pass and we roamed and toured and observed. When you're done \"bus touring\" you just get off the bus, cross the street, and take the other bus back towards your hotel. Very convenient to visiting the Getty Center, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica. On a deep budget, instead of a shuttle you could even take the city bus here from LAX without too much luggage. If you have a car here the street parking/meters will be a hassle. There are parking garages a short walk as well as a huge grocery and a drug store. Would I put up my parents here if they were visiting UCLA? Only if they are used to \"roughing it\". The location would probably be well-worth the dumpiness, but the Hilgard House nearby for $35 more a night is well worth it for the comfort. The room was clean. I think the other reviews that mention \"fleas\" are probably posted by the neighboring fleabag motels that want Claremont's customers. And the \"glowing\" review calling this place charming is a little over the top in the other direction. Whether or not I would recommend this flophouse would totally depend on the customer. For backpacking students who are used to hostels and European b&bs, TOTALLY. The location is great for students and travelers, one of the best in all of Los Angeles as far as convenient public transportation, cheap dining options etc. For UCLA parents?
