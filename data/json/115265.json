The staff have always been excellent; efficient and very prompt to attend me. This August my stay was extended through Hurricane Issac, during which the Avenue Plaza lost power but still gave exceptional care to its guests throughout. Flashlights, drinking water, hot coffee and barbequed burgers and franks were made available, with regular updates on the hurricane and accommodations. When the hurricane subsided and power could not be restored they relocated all of their guests (several busloads) to another lighted and comfortable Wyndham resort downtown. I am very grateful that I was at the Avenue Plaza during the hurricane, and very grateful to the wonderful staff who made the discomforts of this so minimal.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGarden district\u201d", "Author": "Louise W", "ReviewID": "UR137609720", "Content": "Arrived late 0200 after a long flight from Australia.

Fantastic streetcar access from right outside the hotel only 10 minutes to bourbon st by streetcar and only $1.25 per trip. 10 or more cafes and pubs within walking distance most with reasonably priced meals. Blind pelican was good. Also take the streetcar away from city to Oak St. The Maple Bar on Oak has great entertainment on a Tueday. We saw a Grammie award winning big brass band. For breakfast you get good value for money at the streetcar cafe, and if you walk a little further there is a fantastic old style diner that have amazing breakfast and bottomless coffee. You can also walk to a convenience store about 50 meters, a Waldgrens, and a cosy bar 2 doors down that do take food, alcohol, and laundry open 24 hours.

Hot tub was very Hot, the way they should be, onsite people were very helpful and friendly. Steak house next to Ave. Plaza was very good. Take the bus or walk to a very nice supermarket called Fresh Market for local food shopping, excellant food , fresh breads, anythying you would want plus liquor up stairs. The Zoo was not worth the price, weather was soo Hot and Humid most were hiding in some shade.They also charge extra for the train ride and other activities. WW2 Museum was excellant, spent 7 hours at this , The movie which is $11.00 if your not a member or senior was a spare not expense show. very moving. The swamp tour with the boats with large fans to drive them was very good. Get a single bus pass each day, cheaper and if you loose it your not out a weeks worth of tickets. Cafe DuMond was OK, eat quick or the flys will get the food. French quaters flea market is typical, they pretty much all sell the same cheap goods, made in China.

We had a one bedroom unit on the eighth floor. It was clean and spacious. There was a full mini kitchen with a full size refrigerator and two burner cooktop. It even had a small dishwasher. The living room had a sleep sofa, table with four chairs, an easy chair, coffee table and a large flat screen tv. A queen bed, night tables, a dresser and another flat screen tv made up the bedroom. The bathroom had a modern large shower, sink and toilet. The bathroom was small but fine for what you need a bathroom for. We had wonderful views from our eighth floor windows. The whole unit was clean and comfortable. We did utilize the resorts valet parking service. We feel this was well worth the charge. You drop off your car at the entrance to the resort and the valet parks your car in the private parking lot reserved for valet. When you need your car, just call from your room and your car is ready at the front door in ten minutes. The valets are friendly and courtious. To get around, there is public transportation that stops right in front of the resort. Unfortunately, the St Charles streetcar was down for maintenance so we had to use the city bus. A daily pass, for only $3.00, is good for unlimited rides on both the streetcars and bus for the entire day. The guest lounge, located by the pool, has hot coffee, iced tea and lemonade available to the guests every day. There are several nice restaurants close to the resort. A great place for breakfast is the Trolley Stop. Nothing fancy but good food at good prices and very generous servings. For dinner you have Copelands Cheesecake Bistro, VooDoo BBQ, Mia's and more. The resort has Mr. John's Steakhouse. Are there things that detract from this wonderful resort? Yes. The unit only has one mirror. It is the one in the bathroom and is only large enough to show your face. A full length mirror on the door would be a welcome addition. The resort says they have free wifi throughout the resort. They do, but it is so weak you can't connect to it. And if you do connect you lose the signal after 1 - 2 minutes. Our room fronted on St Charles Ave. There was minimal road noise from the normal traffic but when an ambulance went by (and there were many) the siren sounded like it was right in your living room. Soundproof windows would be nice. Overall, our stay at Avenue Plaza was a wonderful experience. The friendliness of the staff, the clean comfortable rooms, the location and the amenities of the resort outweigh the negatives. If we return to New Orleans, we will definitely stay at Avenue Plaza. I recommend it to anyone coming to New Orleans who wants a comfortable and convenient place to stay.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delray Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood location and very friendly staff...until check-out time\u201d", "Author": "TrvlGrl12", "ReviewID": "UR133937237", "Content": "We've been owners of Worldmark for nearly 16 years, but this was our first trip to Avenue Plaza. We booked two studios -- one for my husband and I and one for our friends traveling with us. The studios were furnished nicely, had kitchens, but no adequate mirror. The only mirror was the tiny mirror above the bathroom sink. To see myself fully dressed, I used the mirror out in the hallway by the elevator. Yeah, that was weird but it wouldn't prevent me from staying here again. The staff were overwhelmingly friendly, genuine and appreciative of us. Each morning, we received a \"Good morning\" when passing the front desk. Upon return in the evening, we received a, \"Hello\" or, \"How was your day\" or, \"How are you?\" All four of us literally felt like we were royalty simply based on the consistent friendliness we encountered. It was noticeable and appreciated. If what happened on our last morning could be erased from my mind, I'd give Avenue Plaza 5 stars. However, our last morning was not good. As Worldmark owners, our checkout time was Noon. For everyone else, checkout is at 10:00 a.m. Since it was our last morning, and our flights left in the late afternoon, we wanted to take this morning to sleep in and really relax in bed for the first time since we had been go-go-go for 4 days. At 9:45am we had a knock on our door from a housekeeping gentleman asking us when we planned to check out. My husband told him Noon. He thanked my husband and walked away. Around 10:30am, there was another knock. I answered this time. A housekeeping lady asked when we planned to check out. I asked her why she was the second person to knock on our door, and she just apologized. I told her we'd be out by Noon. Then, about 11am, we received a phone call asking when we planned to check out. My husband told the man that checkout time was Noon, so we'd be out by then. At that point, we both decided that they really wanted us out of there, so we packed everything up and left. It was hardly a relaxing morning with staff trying to get us to leave well before checkout time. Even given this, I'd stay here again, but at the start of my stay I would impress upon the staff to NOT bother us and pester us to leave the room on our last morning well before checkout. There are no \"Do Not Disturb\" signs for the doors, so I see no way around this other than to inform them ahead of time to stay clear of our room. I may actually bring my own sign to hang on the door on the last night. Other than that, I recommend this hotel -- well located right on the St. Charles Streetcar line and next to several eating options -- Cheesecake Bistro, Trolley Stop cafe, Igor's (a laundromat and bar) and a few pubs (Avenue Pub is good!) down the way. It's only a few block walk to Magazine Street as well, which is a great spot for a low-key stroll past the mansions of the Garden District. Stay here.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom and it was really nice, recently redone and clean. The kitchenette had everything you could possible need and had granite countertops, stainless appliances and some had looked like they had never been used! It was a bit pricey, but I guess that is just a product of coming during a very busy time. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bathrooms are VERY small, like another reviewer said, no fan in bathrooms, and at the time we were there the pool/back patio area was closed because they were renovating.

The Avenue Plaza resort didn't disappoint. It is located in the Garden District along St Charles Ave. It is far enough away from the French Quarter and CBD in a quieter suburb, yet close enough to hop on a streetcar and be there in 10 minutes, less the hassle of trying to park or pay for the privilege in expensive car parks. However, word of warning, streetcars during busy periods can be very crowded and unpleasant. Also be sure to say to the driver you want a day pass, (if you want one which is the best option), before putting money into the ticket machine. Or else you'll be yelled at! (Albeit in Southern good humor). The hotel offers valet parking but enough free parking can be found on the street within easy access to the hotel. The room we stayed in was a one bedroom suite on the 10th floor with foldout bedding in the lounge in addition to the big bedroom. It was very clean, the kitchenette was excellent and the view from the suite window was fantastic. For an even better view, the rooftop terrace accessed from the 12th floor is great for a panoramic view of New Orleans and suburbs. Reception desk assistance was disappointing, I asked where I might find the nearest post office and was told to wait for the tour desk manager, who never appeared. Porters were sought, by repeated requests over a lengthy period but never came to assist. Laundry appliances were unreliable, but as I don't like to judge a vacation by doing a mundane chore like laundry, whilst on it, I perhaps should let that pass! LOL.

However, friends were able to snag rooms at the Avenue Plaza Resort for a decent rate. Judging by the hotel's site and TA reviews we weren't expecting much, but the hotel was actually a decent size and the room decor wasn't as dated as the various pictures suggested. Our rooms had practically full kitchens, so a couple could stay there pretty comfortably for an extended time if they wanted to save some money on dining out. One complaint about the room was that for 24 hours we experienced a weird problem with the shower where the water simply wouldn't get hot, regardless of how the knob was turned. Eventually, with the knob cranked to 'H', the water would get warm (not hot) after about ten minutes. Then, before we could raise the issue it fixed itself. By far the biggest problem, though, was the noise the air conditioner made. The AC unit was set inside a wall near the bathroom and close to the bed, and when it ran (which was all the time...it was 85+ degrees all weekend) it rattled. LOUDLY. That made it very difficult to sleep. Unfortunately, because of when we were there, there were no other available rooms to which to move. It was annoying at best, and sleep-ruining at worst. The front desk staff and concierge were friendly and generally helpful, though not quite as professional as I'd expect. Granted, I can only imagine the kind of busy weekend they were having with all the out-of-town basketball fans around, but I suspect the level of service and professionalism didn't change at the uber-busy hotels in the CBD. I didn't know much about the Garden District and thought we'd be in no man's land all weekend, but it was actually great. There are two great breakfast places a stone's throw from the hotel (the very popular Trolley Stop Cafe for big greasy breakfasts, and the Avenue Cafe right next door to the Trolley Stop for smaller breakfasts and better coffee), one of the best beer places (the Avenue Pub) in North America a few blocks down and the St. Charles streetcar right out the front door of the hotel which takes you to the WWII museum or Canal Street in no time.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leonard, North Dakota", "Title": "\u201cFrustrating experience\u201d", "Author": "asilverbullet58104", "ReviewID": "UR126534974", "Content": "I stayed at this place for 9 days and the service is absolutely horrible.

The entire staff was helpful and courteous, the room was clean and just as it was described online, and the balcony was the perfect location for watching the parades away from the chaos of street level. The only issue we had (and it really wasn't a huge deal) was that the resort does not have as many parking spaces as it does rooms. Since they were completely booked due to the holiday, by the time we arrived, we were not able to valet our car. Fortunately, there are ample places in the area to park. With the resort being directly on the parade routes, we were slightly concerened about the crowds on the balcony or courtyard areas. They do a good job of controlling that though with each guest being required to wear a colored wrist band (each day was a different color). Registered guests' bracelets are included in the price of the room and our visitors were able to purchase bracelets for $20 per day. This kept the crowds within the property at a reasonable level. The layout of the room was nice (studio suite) with the kitchen on one side, restroom on the other, a dining area near the large window, and a seperate space for storing luggage. We opted for two queen beds since our friends were staying with us and did not feel crowded at all. I had broken my ankle the night before our stay so was confined to a wheelchair and crutches for the duration.

After reading some of the reviews, I wanted to point out a few things. Staff: While there is no excuse for rude front desk clerks some have complained about, I have never had this experience here. It isn't a high-end luxury resort where the staff are ultra professional and say \"My Pleasure!\" every time you ask them for anything. Frankly, that phoniness annoys me. The staff here are generally locals and nice, usually young, people. Valet Parking: Someone mentioned parking around the corner for free, but I prefer to valet park at Avenue Plaza. It has one of the least expensive daily parking rates of any timeshare in New Orleans. There are a couple that have free parking, but if it's free, you have to park your car yourself, usually in an adjacent garage. I like the valet service at AP. I call down when I'm almost read to leave, and our car is out front waiting for us by the time we get downstairs. When you have packages it's great to be able to pull right up front. The valet guys are really nice and we've never had any theft issues with our cars. Pool - It's one of the nicest at a timeshare, but it is not heated and the spa tub doesn't work and isn't heated either. But it is a nice area to relax and if it's the summer, you really don't want it heated! I just wish it were heated for our winter time visits. Laundry - Not only is does the bar next door double as a laundromat. There is a washer and dryer on every other floor. Free to use. Buy or bring your own detergent. No need to over pack! Internet - Wifi can be iffy in the rooms, usually worse than most hotels, which is never very good anyway. Better service available in the computer room, to the left of the front desk. Spa - There's a spa. I haven't used it. View - The rooms facing St. Charles are all 1 Bedrooms. The bedrooms have a queen sized bed. We like a King sized bed. They are only available as studio units. Some studios have 2 double beds instead, but the room is no bigger, so those feel cramped to me and my husband, so we just take a Kind Studio. Definitely go up to the room and enjoy the view from there. Bathrooms - Were all upgraded over the last few years. Many people complain that they are cramped, but believe me, they are better than they used to be! The main shower-head is a rain type directly over head, but there is also a handheld unit, so you can switch to that one if you don't want to get your hair wet. There is also a nice and convenient public restroom area to the left of the elevators, jic you get back from touring and more than one person has to \"go\"!

The location is up St. Charles Avenue, at the border of the Garden District which is quite nice and I recommend the Historical Tour. The biggest problem is the trolley service which is irradic at best. Yes it looks quaint and is nice if it is not packed and comes when you need it. However, the reality is that it can be packed in the mornings and evenings, and they tend to get bunched up so that there will be 3 in a row and then none for a long time. Also there are no benches or awnings to cover you if it rains. When you get on, each person has to pay $1.25 or $3 for a day pass (a good deal) or scan their pass. This takes a long time because the machine isn't very good and often doesn't take some dollar bills or read the legitimate passes. As for the resort, our king room was nice with a well equipped small kitchen and was quiet. It was not located on St. Charles St. and overlooked the pool, which looked fine but was small and we didn't use because it was cold when we were there. The bathroom was tiny, and only had a small 18\" by 24\" mirror at best. So don't think about seeing how you look before you go out. Also the shower head is directly over your head, so you will need to bring a shower cap if you don't want to wash your hair that day (they do not provide one). You could hear people in the halls once in a while but that was not really a problem because that was not too late at night or too early. As for some great things to do in New Orleans. Eat of course. Also, the Jean Lafitte Historical Society's free tour of New Orleans is excellent, as is the Garden District tour by Historical New Orleans Tours. We also enjoyed the Natches Riverboat cruise and the Sculpture Garden in the City Park area. There is also a museum and botanical gardens at City Park, but we didn't have enough time, since we were enjoying the food at Cafe Degas down the block, excellent but pricey. I would use the 91 bus to get to City Park rather than take the St. Charles trolley and Canal St. trolley that everyone will recommend that you take.

The three of us stayed in a one bedroom unit and didn't feel crowded. My sister and I shared the bed (which was comfortable and plenty big enough) and my brother slept on the hide-a-bed. Everything was clean, we didn't notice anything unusual or badly constructed in our room, and the staff was quite friendly (except one guy that we only saw once right before we left). Didn't have any problems with the elevators, and never saw the staff in them. We heard a little bit of construction noise once or twice during the day, but nothing serious. There was a full-length mirror in the bedroom in addition to the one over the sink in the bathroom (other reviews complained about lack of mirrors - perhaps this was in a studio room?). Also had no problems connecting to the internet from our room. The only real complaints we had were with the water temperature in the shower, and the shower set up in our room. The temperature rarely got above barely warm (although it was not ice cold), and only once or twice did it get anything close to hot. Also, we somehow ended up in an \"accessible\" room, and there was no separate shower in the bathroom - there were drains on the floor and the shower head was on the wall - not even a shower curtain! It would have been OK except no one else could be in the bathroom if someone else was showering - modesty aside, you would get soaked from the spray! My sister and I usually share the bathroom and one can use the sink/mirror while the other is showering, but this set-up slowed us down when we were trying to get ready and out the door for the day. We liked the neighborhood - it was kind of nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter. We also really appreciated having the streetcar right outside the door - saved a lot of money in transportation costs! You do need to be a little patient with the timing of the streetcars (especially late at night) and be prepared to stand when it's crowded. Zara's grocery store (a few blocks away) was the best one we found (more selection than the one St. Charles, which I think was Williams Market). Zara's is not a \"supermarket,\" but had a better selection than the other one if you are planning to do any cooking in your room. There were a few restaurants within walking distance on St. Charles, but we didn't get a chance to try any of them (we mostly ate in the French Quarter). There's also a Walgreens nearby (easy walk for an able-bodied adult). We got a nice little packet from the concierge for a self-guided walking tour of the historic Garden District homes, and this is a great option for the budget-conscious who don't want to pay for a tour. Note that only one home is open for indoor tours, and it's only open on Mondays (New Orleans Opera Women's Guild Home on Prytania St, $7 pp). Lafayette Cemetery is within walking distance and seemed perfectly safe during daylight hours (it closes at 2:30 pm). We rode the streetcar to the end of the line toward the Upper Garden District/Uptown neighborhoods, and if you go at a time of day that's not crowded so you can sit down, it was a great way to see the architecture - we thought many of the homes we saw were more impressive than the ones near the hotel that get so much attention. We took a walk in the residential area at the end of the line and saw some really cool houses. Highly recommend booking Charles Ritz Enterprises for transportation to/from the airport - same price as a cab but his vehicle is much nicer/cleaner.

For a more informal experience, you have to go to Voodoo BBQ just a couple of blocks down St. Charles toward the Quarter. It was Halloween so we did a ghost tour. It's basically an historical tour. It's interesting but don't expect to do a seance or anything like that. But do visit the St. Louis cemetary. The history there is incredible. And do go to Frenchman's street to hear the music that New Orleanians listen to. OK, now for the hotel. It was far better than I thought it would be. We had a 1/1. The building is old and rennovated.

The resort, located in the historic Garden District, is completely renovated and just beautiful, the staff is fantastic. Within 2 minutes of arriving, I had been given the tip to purchase daily streetcar passes ($3.00) instead of the 5-day Jazzy pass, thereby saving money. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy. The streetcars stop right at the resort. The streetcar drivers are aware of the resort and if you ask they will let you know when it's time to get off. The consierge has a map of New Orleans, for the asking, and so you can quickly learn your way around. We found everyone, in the resort and on the streets, seemed to love coming to our assistance. Also, ask the consierge for a map of the Garden District self-guided walking tour. The gorgeous walking tour is within a 4 block area near Ave. Plaza. I walked the route after I took a \"Save Our Cemeteries\" tour and also The Original N.O. Movie Tour. With all I learned from those tours it really made my own Garden District walk that more meaningful. Our studio looked brand new and we have never stayed in a timeshare so well equipped. Let's start in the kitchen: granite countertops, nice size refrig., microwave, 2 burner flat stovetop, dishwasher, blender, toaster, coffeemaker, 4 piece settings of plates, glassware, utensils, dishwashing detergent for sink and dishwasher, pots and pans, 4-cup coffee packets (delicious coffee- as I used up packets I asked for more from Lobby desk), small salt and pepper, paper towels, microwave popcorn, ice bucket, coasters, dishtowels and oven mitts. A nice sized table and two chairs for meals. We had a comfortable king-size bed with 6 pillows, 2 end tables with lamps, alarm clock, 42\" flat screen t.v. sitting on small armoire which my husband used for some of his clothes. The bathroom is small but the shower (with 2 shower heads) was the width of the bathroom. Plenty of towels, hairdryer, and samples of lotion, shampoo, conditioner and soap. Granite countertops in bath and small dressing area. The closet was a small walk-in with two levels of shelving, a safe, a broom, iron and ironing board. There were 3 mirrors- one in bath, dressing area and a long one by the entrance door. We pack only carry-on luggage and the storage was fine for us. If you pack BIG you may want a one-bedroom. This is a timeshare resort, no maid service, so if you want daily cleaning I'm sure you can arrange it. We do without because I'd rather not \"clean up\" before the maid comes in (I don't find making the bed and doing dishes all that difficult on vacation). As it was hot, sunny and humid all week, the pool was great for floating and cooling off. I loved sitting in the courtyard around the pool, surrounded by the haunted Ashley house, listening to the water in the fountain and sounds of the streetcars going by. In case of an emergency there is a phone, in the pool area, for calling the Lobby Desk. They have thought of everything! Pool towels are at the Lobby desk for the asking and can be dropped off on the Ashley House porch. The sundeck is a staircase above the 12th floor. It has tables, chairs, loungers and great sunset views. It helped orient us to the crescent- shaped city. There are numerous grocery markets and restaurants within a short walking distance to the resort. Next to the Lobby is a computer access room for guests, 3 computers with a printer. How simple,convenient and timesaving to print out my boarding passes for our flights home. The day before we left I asked the porter about transportation to the airport. He recommended Charles Ritz and made arrangements for pick-up. Charles was on time, with a roomy SUV, a bright smile and friendly personality. I wish I had known about him when we had landed in N.O. Talking to him would have been a great way to start our vacation. The best thing going for Ave. Plaza is the friendly, respectful and helpful staff. Everyone always acknowledges you and when I mentioned how beautiful the resort was, their faces lit up like they owned the place. The resort has a gorgeous and convenient location, fantastic units and the greatest staff. Southern hospitallity is alive and well at Ave. Plaza.

The St Charles street car stops in front of the resort, which makes it easy to get into the Quarter.

From the exterior, the hotel is clearly an older facility that from the interior has been rehabilitated and brought into the 21st century. My room was delightful-- a fully-equipped kitchen with a two burner stove, dishwasher, a small standard sized fridge and granite counter tops; a king sized comfortable bed with great linens, an outstanding view of the city, and an in-room safe. The only negative about it was that there was a beautiful, large tumbled limestone shower with a rain head and hand shower as well, but no tub. (It was way too cold to use the heated pool and hot tub outside.) I should mention that there is no daily cleaning of the room (since it is a time share hotel), and that towels are not replaced by housekeeping, except on the weekends. Rather, the guest can exchange towels daily on the first floor if s/he wants to. I did take advantage of this ability, and saw the entrance to the spa and gym on that floor, which both looked great, but I didn't use them. The prices on the spa treatments seemed high to me, but I'm not from a city, so I really am not familiar with these types of costs in an urban area. As far as the common areas of the hotel, they were uniformly beautiful. Here the only negative was that the elevators didn't appear to have been renovated as yet; maintenance staff were working on one of them during the week I was there, however. I took advantage of the complimentary washers and dryers once during my stay, and the complimentary coffee and lemonade / iced tea daily. I wish I could have spent more time on the roof top deck, but again, the weather didn't cooperate. I used the free in-room wifi (with a connection of good to very good) daily. The hotel is located adjacent to the gorgeous garden district and directly across from a street car stop on St. Charles Street, which made going into the French Quarter a $1.25,10 minute delightful ride away. There are any number of restaurants within walking distance in the neighborhood, as a well as a Walgreen's that has a more-than-expected food selection so I could take advantage of the kitchen in my studio apartment. There is also a small market a few steps away from the hotel, but I didn't have occasion to use it and a tourist bureau across the street, which I did go to. The staff of the hotel, from the concierge to the bellman to the desk clerks to the housekeeping and maintenance personnel were friendly and helpful. They were not only willing to answer my questions and give me advice when I asked, they were also interested in my volunteering, the reason for my being in the city. I had a AAA price for this hotel, which was a wonderful value. The only issue I had was that the entire 8 night stay (with tax $794) was charged to my credit card as soon as I made the reservation-- three months prior to my stay. I travel extensively, and I am used to being billed at most the fee for one night for a confirmed reservation, with the remainder collection at the time of the visit. I'm not sure why Wyndham billed this way, unless it was due the the hotel's being a time share facility, but it was a bit annoying and unexpected. All in all, this hotel exceeded my expectations. At the price I paid, I would definitely recommend it to a friend (in fact, I already have), and I would certainly stay there again should the occasion arise.

The employees and concierge at the resort were enthusiastically friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out were very efficient. Unfortunately, that was about the only positive experience from our stay at the Wyndham Avenue Plaza (at least for our one-week trade with R.C.I.). We were disappointed with our 1-bedroom condo because the lack of attention to details within the unit. The fit and finish of some of the trim pieces (very sloppy painting and installation). The TVs were old and didn't have the best picture quality. Thankfully, my husband and I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch much TV. I was bummed that there was no bathtub in our unit. Only a shower was provided. I was informed by an employee that there are no bathtubs available at the entire resort. Our bathroom had much to be desired. The shower head in the shower broke off its holder. I noticed black mold in some areas and it really needed to be re-grouted and resealed. The tile work was crooked and uneven (not much quality workmanship). The seal around the shower door was horrible and we found it difficult to keep the floor dry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outside\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the shower. The holder for the toilet paper roll was pulled away from the wall. Maintenance's fix was a free-standing toilet paper holder. We found the bedroom clock was broken and they replaced it but with a bit of a delay. I phoned them early in the evening and they said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d send someone up with a replacement. It never showed. I called them the next morning and I was assured they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d bring a clock to our room. We came back late in the evening and it still hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been replaced. On the morning of the THIRD day I went directly to the front desk and talked politely with a very apologetic lady and she told me she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d personally take one to our room. Thankfully the clock was there in our room when we came back later that evening. The sofa (couch) in the living room looked a bit tattered and we could see some parts of the fabric that were ripped and hanging underneath. We added one day at the end of our existing reservation with WorldMark by Wyndham. We moved from our 1-bedroom unit into a studio. We were very pleasantly surprised to have a remodeled room! :) All the furniture, carpet and appliances looked fairly new. The shower was still an issue because there was black mold still visible in some areas but not as much as the other unit. The tile workmanship had much to be desired (crooked, uneven cuts, and filling huge gaps with grout). I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why someone would not take more pride in their work. On a positive note, we appreciated the nice size electronic safe that was provided in the bedroom free of charge (it was big enough for my laptop to fit in). The bed was very comfortable and we really liked the assortment of pillows that were provided. We slept well and both my husband and I are thankful for that since we both deal with chronic back pain. The fitness room is very well furnished and there's a wide assortment of cardio, weight machines and free weights. The high-speed internet had something to be desired. It was incredibly slow when I tried to upload photos. At times I would let my computer load the photos when I went to sleep. All-in-all, I would stay at the Avenue Plaza but only if we were promised to stay in a newer furnished unit. The resort is located in a beautiful section of New Orleans within a 5-minute walk to the official Garden District. The streetcars are very reasonably priced. One-way is only $1.25 or you could pay $5 to ride the streetcars and buses all day in the city. What a super deal! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother renting a vehicle unless you want to pay almost $12 a day to park it at the resort and then more money for parking spots in town (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so lucky to find a spot and one that is secure/safe).", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat but this is a time share hotel\u201d", "Author": "dallascowgal22", "ReviewID": "UR87555462", "Content": "I didn't know this was a time share or member ownership resort as they like to call it.

The unit had everything we could possibly need in the kitchen facility. They even provided salt & pepper and spices if you wanted to do any cooking. When we got there the A/C was not working, but a quick call to the front desk and it was fixed by the time we got back in from dinner. Great location in the garden district......trolley stop right out front to take you anywhere in the French Quarter or Garden district.

The cost for three nights was $500. The hotel is located in the Garden District, away from the activity in the French Quarter. This made for a quieter stay but made touring the French Quarter more difficult. The St. Charles Ave. trolley stops in front of the hotel but you must be prepared for the walk from Canal St. into the Quarter. If you plan to go to the French Market, it is a bit of a walk to get there. I paid $60 something for valet parking at the hotel and then drove my car to the Quarter so I wouldn't have to walk so far. I had to pay $13 for parking each day in the lot along the river on Decatur St. I took the trolley one night because I was eating dinner near Canal St. and it was more convenient than driving.

Thursdays: Go to Tropical Island on St. Peters and Bourbon, grab a Hand Grenade. Find a great band and just hang out. Fat Cats is always a can't miss with the band. Friday: Hit up at Pat O'Brien's just past Bourbon St. and St. Peters. Grab a Hurricane. You can either ask for a plastic cup or get the gigantic Hurricane glass cup that will cost $3 extra. The glass cup is a great souvenir. Sit down and eat dinner. Try the gator strips. Ask for \"Frank\", the Sous Chef at Pat O's. He is a great guy who will give you great pointers. Tell him Josue and Ian still think it is his fault. If you want hip hop and club stuff stay on Bourbon. If you want great music, head to Frenchman st, where the locals hang. Keep reading. Saturday: Head to Frenchman Street, Just a 5 minute walk from Bourbon Street, just off of Esplanade Street. The Soul Rebel Brass Band plays at Blue Nile. They are great! A reggae band plays a block away. And at Snug Harbor you can catch the best Jazz musicians in New Orleans. After you get out of the clubs head a block up for Burritos.

As it's been previously stated, the rooms were clean, street car RIGHT in front of the hotel to take you to the French Quarter...(and it runs pretty often until well after midnight so you'll always have a ride back..EXACT CHANGE is a must though!). There are bars right next door that have food. There are also several other restaurants right within walking distance (fast food and actual restaurants). There's a, well, not really sure they they CALL it a \"supermarket\" when it's no bigger than my corner stores back here in NY.. but nonetheless, it's there on the corner of Avenue Plaza so that you can purchase your groceries being that all the rooms have kitchens with full size fridge and a stove top (no ovens though). If i had to pick something i didn't like, there would be 2 things. One, it's a pretty big hotel with i think 13 floors (not sure how many rooms on each floor but i know it's quite a bit), but there's only 3 washers and 3 dryers for the ENTIRE BUILDING.. Therefore, using the laundry facilities towards the end of your stay was strictly survival of the fittest!!...(You MIGHT find an available machine between midnight and 4am!! ) The 2nd thing i wasn't as thrilled about...(i read others say the small bathroom.. but lets face it, i was never planning on having a \"party\" in there so...) my problem was the pots and pans!!!. I didn't like the fact that they weren't non-sticking pans. I had to make like half a dozen eggs every day just to make sure we'd get the equivelent of 2 scraped out of the pan!!. I tried coating it myself with Pam..but that didn't really seem to help all that much. I think with as much money as that place must rake in, they might want to invest in non stickwear things!! Otherwise, i had a great time and i'd stay there ANYTIME i go to New Orleans I should however point out that i discovered while i was there (during a timeshare owners meeting they had one morning), that for anyone owning a 2 or more bedroom place..

The city can be seen as a jewel, or some people see it as \"old\" or \"dirty\". The people who think New Orleans is dirty have that Depression era mentality that new is clean, and old is dirty. Well, the Avenue Plaza is not brand new, but it is going through some updates. We are timeshare owners at the Avenue Plaza, but have never stayed there (We always used it as a trade). We had to go to New Orleans for a wedding, and one of the benefits of ownership is the ability to book a few nights as a hotel stay at a discounted rate. (A nice perk). Check in was quick, and so was check out. Car service (valet) was quick. It costs $18 per day, but only $8 per day if an owner (another perk). I waited only a few minutes each time. The room had two queen beds, a refridgerator, microwave, coffee maker, two burner stove, dishwasher, in room safe, table and chairs, and a TV. Rooms have been updated and are bigger than other rooms I have stayed in in New Orleans. Bathroom was not huge, but fine. Had a hairdryer, iron and board. Water needed to run a long time before it got hot, but got there. The Spa was all booked up for treatments on Saturday, but had openings at any other time. The thing I loved about our stay was this workout facility. It had a couple of bikes (with built in TVs), stair machines, assorted machines and free weights. The wet area had a dry sauna, a steam room, a whirlpool jaccuzzi, and outdoor heated pool. Towel service was included. I think the use of the workout area has a small fee, but is free for owners (perk, again!) The facility is not brand new, but it is functional. And it was nice to sweat out the impurities before replacing them the next day in the French Quarter. Access to the streetcar is FANTASTIC!!!!!!! It stops right out front. And the Avenue Plaza is close enough to the CBD and the Quarter that even if the car stops at every stop, it won't take long to or from the Quarter. This is the reason you should stay here. If you have never been to New Orleans and you stay in or near the Quarter, you might not get Uptown at all and missout the beautiful architecture of the Garden District and University areas. The trolley ride in both direstions is manageable from The Avenue Plaza. If you stay in the Quarter, it is one long ride to many destinations up the line. I would rather stay right where you are at the Avenue Plaza. And I've been to New Orleans about 30 times over my lifetime. The Avenue Plaza has a nice steakhouse and small bar in the lobby. We did not eat there, but it is big with the locals. The closest bar not on sight is right next door, The venerable Uber-dive bar IGORS, and walking distance a a good breakfast place called the Trolley Stop. Great stuffed omelette. The Pontchartrain Hotel is next door and has a nice bar. We have stayed there too. But the Avenue Plaza is a winner. It isn't the Ritz Carlton.

Several times we asked the evening clerk for directions, to which she responded somewhat nastily, \"Why would you want to go there?\" When we actually made it to 'there' (Magazine Street) we were thankful that we didn't take her advice to just stay in our little corner of the Garden District. By the way, Magazine Street has wonderful, wonderful little stores, cafes, and galleries. Definatly worth the trip. Also, we were two couples sharing a room. Every day we'd have to call down to get a 4th set of towels as EVERY day they would leave us only 3 even though we kept telling them we would need 4 sets everyday and asked them to note it in housekeeping. This is a mild inconvenience, but annoying to have to keep calling. The location is great, close enough to the French Quarter via Trolley to enjoy the action there, but far enough away to have some peace and quiet when you needed it. It goes without saying that the Garden District is lovely. We spent at least two days strolling around looking at the architecture. Overall, this place is fine to stay at, but nothing fabulous.

Location was great: easy access to streetcar, away from French Quarter \"noise\" and large room with full refigerator, microwave and stove-top elements and next door to the famous Pontchartrain Hotel. We stayed on the top floor - easy access to rooftop jacuzzi and views (not used but looked clean/enjoyable), no waiting for elevators (a potential problem for lower floors as hotel was busy) and good city views from our room. Downside: paint was peeling on ceiling (not noticed on lower floor rooms we happened to see) and a musty \"smell\" on floor though not in the room. May have been a smoking room (not sure but something was there - okay to us non-smokers but nevertheless something was there). Found rooms to be of a good size and generally comfortable. We had a double queen with adjoining bathroom and make-up room. Conversations in the adjoining room could be heard through a connecting door in the make-up room but were not objectionable (the fact we had a separate make-up room was a plus). One of the queen beds was slightly broken (we heard this was the same thing in the adjoining room!) but this didn't interfere with our sleep etc. Had no pressure whatsoever from time share sales and in fact would not have known this was also a timeshare destination if not for trip advisor and the fact that a noticeable number of \"tours\" were being conducted of the hotel. We booked through the hotel's own website and received a discounted room for a multiple night stay (US$75/night plus tax for 2 adults and 1 child though rates could be double+ this for other nights). We did have a room rate \"problem\" that was ultimately resolved to our satisfaction. We had booked two nights on-line and then called the hotel directly to extend this for an extra night. When we checked mid-stay they were charging us $150/night and based on initial discussions with the Manager this was going to be a \"big\" problem to correct as they had us recorded at a $150/night rate by a \"third party\" reservation agency (yes, the same one their own web site referred us to!) and could do nothing about this. Luckily, I had printed out the confirmation receipt and was able to show that the rate was $150 for two nights, not one! After that, no problems but we could see how this would have been difficult without evidence! We ate a Copeland's Cheesecake - good food though a long wait to get in. St Paddy's Day parade was within a block of the hotel (a real plus and a key point for our five year old who enjoyed this and the 20 pounds of necklaces etc. we collected immensely - watch out for the flying cabbages though!) Without question we would stay again at this hotel for the rate quoted. As a family, we would have liked even an extra night to see everything as this was not possible - Zoo and Aquarium worth a visit and of course the French Quarter. The Visitour transit passes (available nearby) made everything easy to get to though were probably not a big saving in the end (consider getting these for a day rather than 3 day block we did as there was no extra savings). Martin Wine Store was a few streetcar stops away (just off of St. Charles) and worth the trip. We did not make it to the Children's Museum and the nearby Lafayette cemetery was closed during our Sunday visit. Good restaurants nearby (including a Houston's, plus Copeland's and fast food/Subway etc.) as well as a large Walgreens's pharmacy etc. French Quarter easily accessible by streetcar (we ate at Buba Gump's Seafood which was fun and good value for your money as the portions were huge).

Easy to get around town by cable car Yes ,I would stay there again.", "Date": "May 6, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGood place, Good price.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR574177", "Content": "The Avenue Plaza is a good bet for the price. It is right on the streetcar line ($12 for a 3 day unlimited pass) and right next to Igor's which you will quickly learn to love as your pre, post and anywhere in between favorite watering hole and laundromat. Some of the cheapest Abita in town! The pool is a nice perk although there is little lounging room around it but there is a sundeck on the roof with a great view of the city and a hot tub which was not functional when we were there. Our fold-out sofa was close to inexcusable as a bed however so you might consider checking it out right away. The one bedroom suites are the way to go for 2 couples splitting the bill. The staff was great, one of our favorite bands was staying at the hotel and it is hard to beat the a/c shuttle directly to JazzFest (although if you master the bus system and don't mind waiting in line a bit, you can save yourself $10 a day). It does take some time to get to the French Quarter and even longer to get home in the wee hours of the night via the streetcar but it IS New Orleans and you have to take things slow anyway. It is a perfect jumping off point for exploring the rest of the Garden District, Lafayette Cemetary, Magazine Street and Uptown.
