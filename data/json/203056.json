Just a few min walk and you are at the Vatican. The hotel offers free wireless although only in 30 min intervalls and only in the lobby areas which we found to be a bit annoying. Breakfast is included and has an assortment of pastries and meats, eggs, juices and you can full your own pots of coffee. It was average food, not amazing but not bad. If you are venturing into the rest of Rome to see the other sites, it can be a nice stroll but bring your walking shoes. We walked everywhere in Rome, from one end of the city to the other. It allows you to see everything and really enjoy the culture but just remember that the hotel is on the east end of the city, not in the middle. That being said I did not have one issue with walking everywhere. Around the hotel are plenty of little stores, restaurants and gelatto places to go to. Its mainly smaller side streets where the hotel is. The staff were very friendly and you can book tours through them in which the tour will pick you up and drop you off (most pick you up and drop you off somewhere in the middle of the city but double check this depending on which tour you book). We took a tour to Pompeii which was amazing and well worth it. We were the first people to be picked up and the last to be dropped off though so it made for a long day since our hotel is outside the city on the other side of the river. The accomidations itself were nice. Don't expect spectacular but it was not dingy or drab either. It was average, clean and fine for our week long visit. Tip: From the airport you can take a 4 euro bus into the city. One company charges 6 EUR and the other 4 EUR, signes are posted everywhere and you can pay the driver when the bus comes or pay inside the airport. The bus will take you to Termini which is on the west end of the city, essentially the opposite side of Vatican city so you will need to trek all the way across the city to get to the hotel but if you don't mind a nice walk then you should go for it. If not, the area that the bus drops you off is right by a bus depot and you can take the bus towards the vatican or hop in a cab. On the way back to the airport we opted to take a Taxi which the hotel arrnaged for 47 Euro which included tip. If you have several people in your group and don't want to walk clear across the city this could be an option for you.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cTop location, average hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jonnym_7", "ReviewID": "UR127824199", "Content": "After staying at the Starhotel in Naples we were not expecting much from this hotel, but it surprised us and was a pleasant stay overall due to its great location. We stayed at the Michelangelo for 4 nights, and I chose this hotel based on its mainly good reviews on tripadvisor and it's location to the Vatican. Before arrival I emailed the hotel to request a quiet and high floored room. Check in was quick and efficient and was greeted by a friendly chap on reception, who also gave us a good map for Rome and provided some tourist information. We were then taken to our room on the 7th floor, room 706. It was a lovely cosy room and seemed quiet as was not facing a road, and was at the back of the hotel. If you leaned out of the window you could see the Vatican. Old style 'box' tv with only 2 English speaking news channels, and no free wi fi in the room. Free wifi in the lobby area.\u00a0 At night, with tv off etc, the quiet room I thought we had was not so quiet and as I'm a light sleeper, struggled to sleep that night as I could hear a constant hum and vibration from next door, which turns out to be ventilation. In the morning I explained about the noise, which reception are aware of, so they offered me another room to check out so we could change rooms, however the other room was in front of the lifts, on the 3rd floor (so close to the road) and had construction work going on in the rooms next to it, plus the room was not as good/nice as the one we had. I informed reception of this, so they showed me to another room which was exactly the same as the previous room they showed me but was on the 2nd floor, but still in front of lifts etc. So in the end just decided to stay in our room on the 7th floor as had some earplugs with me, and thank god I did.\u00a0Really, at check in they should of notified me that the room may be a little noisy as they were aware of this when I complained about the noise. Breakfast was pretty average, no plastic cups like at the Starhotel Naples, but was pretty similar spread of hot and cold foods. Little bit better choice at this hotel, but you have to get your own tea/coffee which is rare at a 4 star hotel and I've never known that before. Staff were also pretty miserable.\u00a03 members of staff faffing and wondering around, when only 1 needed for food replenishment etc and clearing tables, as you don't get shown to a table and they don't get you hot drinks. Location of this hotel is brilliant and is the best thing about the hotel.\u00a0It cost \u20ac12 to get a taxi from the main train station to the hotel, and is located only 5 minutes walk from the Vatican. Plenty of local restaurants. We managed to walk from the Colosseum back to the hotel in just under an hour.\u00a0 All in all an average hotel in a great location with good rooms depending on which one you get as the standard room we had was a lot nicer and cosier than the other standard rooms I had seen. Would have given 4 stars but due to noisy room and some miserable staff encounters, bring it down to 3 stars", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRight next to St. Peter's Basilica\u201d", "Author": "Rick F", "ReviewID": "UR125180638", "Content": "If Vatican city was little bit bigger, this hotel would be part of Vatican city, that is how close this hotel is to St. Peter's Basilica.

The breakfast choice are really good, lots of options for meat, bread, fruit and drinks. The hotel room are really spacious and clean, the bed was soft and big, one thing I like the most about the room is the bath room, it is really modern and clean, I've seen many hotel bath rooms, this is definitely a good one. The surrounding area of the hotel is really quiet and peaceful, totally opposite of the city centre in rome, there are few really nice little restaurants near this hotel with their italian charm, but not like most restaurants in the city centre area for tourists, they are proper italian food for local people, and the price are really reasonable. The only disadvantage about this would be it is far from the city centre and where most tourist attractions are, it usually take me 30-40 minutes to walk to the city centre area and my feet hurt so much when i get into the city, for the last few days i just decide to take taxi, which is much easier and enjoyable, but can be costly, depending on the traffic.

Location Cons: It is *NOT* close to anything else. The buses seemed to run once every 30 minutes if you're lucky so we just walked to everything. It's quite a hike from the Vatican to the Colosseum in the heat of August. The walk also has you go through a pretty long tunnel. It's not the most pleasant walk. The hotel does offer a complimentary breakfast (fruit + dry pastries + coffee). It was nothing special. We probably went two out of four mornings. My biggest advice on finding a hotel in Rome is to find a hotel close to where you expect to be going. This hotel was so far that it felt like most of our days were designed around walking back and forth.

We had emailed the hotel directly ahead of time and request balcony rooms/non-smoking, so this was helpful. Also, (through prior email contact) the hotel arranged a direct pick-up from the airport for us. The driver was waiting with a sign. He had a larger Mercedes mini-van that was comfortable and convenient. $65 Euros for 4-people . ROOMS - The bed was comfortable (by European standards), plus the hotel has a pillow menu. No rock hard european pillows if you don't want them! Also, had a mini-bar, A/C, balcony, safe and typical smaller bathroom with bidet. Bring your electrical converters. FOOD - The hotel serves a great buffet breakfast with hot and cold items, plus all the cappucino you can drink. Claudio who runs the lounge/bar was very friendly and attentive. A great spot for your pre-dinner cocktail. There were two excellent restaurants just a few blocks away that we enjoyed. (Go right out hotel lobby, up 2 blocks then turn left.) One is a seafood restaurant and the other is traditional Roman (La Frusta). The owner Pietro was outstanding and friendly. LOCATION - The location is fine. Only one block to the buses, one block to the San Pietro train station and about a 5-minute walk right to the centre of St. Peter's Square, or hop-on/off buses. It is not close to the Metro however, but we didn't find this a problem this time, even though we had previously stayed in the Termini area.

Luckily we were able to check in at 11:30 am. The suite is large for European standards. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from St. Pete's square & the dome of the Cathredral is visible from the front of the hotel. We were concerned about how far it was to walk over the bridge to Rome. We quickly found 2 bridges in front of the St. Angelo's castle (10 mins to bridge of Tibre River). Every day we walked through the square and Vatican City to get to the bridge (very nice stroll). There are restaurants close to the hotel but Vatican City is very quiet at night compared to Rome. The hotel provided a complementary buffet breakfast each morning which consisted of eggs, bacon, sausages, cheese, fruit, yogurt, salad, and lots of pastries. The front desk staff varied from grumpy older gentlemen who seemed bothered to answer a question, to friendly younger staffers. Everyone spoke English and seemed amused at my attempts to speak a few words of Italian. There is a bar off of the lobby but never seemed occupied. The bartender also seemed bothered to fetch 2 glasses of wine. There is no ice machine in the hotel and the bartender reluctantly gave me 2 glasses to take up to the room.

We soon worked out that all was not as good as we thought. Although the hotel is technically close to a train station, it is the regional train station which does not take you into the main city. The fact that it was next to the Vatican was a selling point for us, but after you see it on the first day, you realise that everything else is actually far away. If we ever return back to Rome we would stay at a place that was close to a Metro station (not a regional one) which is the main service that runs through the city and can get you to almost all the major tourist spots. The staff is very polite and friendly, however we were often recommended and pointed to use services which they were obviously partnered with. The tourist bus service they offered was both more expensive and less frequent than the one we found (and ended up using) from the souvenir store around the corner. Upon leaving they recommended that we use their limousine service to get to the airport citing that the taxi might over charge us and that the train would be very expensive. We soon worked out that by law, a taxi can only charge 40 Euros maximum and that the train was only 8 Euros (much less than they cited). We ended up taking the train and saved ALOT of money compared to their service. The buffet breakfast was quite sub-standard. Although it had the standard servings of bacon and eggs, bread etc, I have never met a place where I declined a serving of bacon before - it was just very poor tasting. By the 3rd day I stopped eating them and stuck to cereal. Food outside is much cheaper and much more tasty. Lastly, the towels we had in our room had dark stains on them. To be fair there were good things about the hotel. Free wifi is a godsend (altho you do have to re-get a voucher every 30 mins from the concierge). The room was very clean. As mentioned, the staff are generally helpful and polite. Location wise, it's close to a small grocery store, a pharmacy and some really nice restaurants - i got sick so the pharmacy was needed! If you intend to use the tourist/public bus (which you will definitely need as the train station is useless), the San Pietro stop is a major stop that all the tourist buses and public buses run through which is really convenient. The room aircon was fantastic - and especially needed as temps hit the 40C mark! Overall, mainly due to location I would stay somewhere else next time.

Imagine my surprise when they charged me $11 Euros for her access. Their excuse was that she didn't ask for the \"Free Internet Access\". Are you kidding me?!? We were checking in and they were well aware of our room type. A guy from Texas had just checked into a Jr Suite before me. While I was checking out he overheard my discussion regarding the bill. He was there on Vatican business and they told him that his internet access was $25 Euros for 24 hours. I wasted no time in showing him the noteboard and that it should be free. At least that is one person that they will not gouge. Aside from the front desk situation, the room was nice and the maids were very friendly. It had very nice bathroom facilities. The restaurant was quite overpriced and the waiter kept ignoring us throughout the meal. It was almost like they had a disdain for foreigners. Couldn't figure it out. The view from out front of the hotel was great. Made a wonderful photo. Upon our return from our cruise, we stayed at the Rome Cavelleri. What a big difference in every sense of the word.

Last time we were in Europe, we were unimpressed by the excessive firmness of European beds. The beds were her big selling point. Upon arrival, we were promptly and courteously greeted and checked in. The process was rapid and easy. Given we were VERY tired, that was great. The room was a good size, especially for Rome. We booked thru Costco and it was described as a Superior room. It did face the street, so there was some noise, but nothing some ear plugs did not fix for me. There was a balcony, which was nice as well. The fixtures were not necessarily luxurious, but there was ample closet and drawer space for two women who pack heavy. The bathroom was the best feature, if you ask me. The tub was PERFECT for soaking your tired legs and feet. I miss it, now that we have moved on to another city. Another thing we enjoyed was the electric kettle. We both enjoy tea and being able to make our own cup was great. Housekeeping was courteous and thorough. I really was pleased with the cleanliness of the rooms. As for the bed, well it was OK. I would not call it pillow soft, nor would I say it was like a board. I guess it is best to say it was the most comfortable bed I have slept in during any of my European stays. One helpful thing to know is that the front desk will exchange your money without a commission. The rates are pretty close to the current currency rates for the day. For tech junkies like me, be advised that this hotel DOES NOT have free internet in the rooms. You can get a 128K connection for 30 minutes for free in the lobby, if you like, but ewwww. You won't like. The fee for 24 hours was 11.50 Euros and 54.50 Euros got you 7 days. Yikes! Lastly, the location is nice. I enjoyed exploring the working class neighborhood that surrounds it. I found a lovely bakery and small grocery around the corner.

There was enough towels, both for washing and drying and everything was changed every day. Much has been said about the staff in the earlier reviews, but I must say that I experienced the staff as either; - Happy and polite (smiling etc) - Neutral and polite (not smiling, but still nothing like cross/grumpy). We never experienced negative staff during our 3 nights in Rome and we got clear and quick assistance when we did have an question. I suppose it sometimes comes down to how you approach people, usually I approach with a smile and a positive attitude. Breakfast was what I'd like to refer to as a \"Traditional hotel/English breakfast\", bacon, eggs and loads of various bread and stuff to put on, really nice, though we only ate there once. The location of the hotel is so that you will have to take the bus if you'd like to see stuff like the Colosseum, the Spanish steps and the Trevi Fountain etc. The busses stops just about 100 meters from the hotel and the trip from the hotel to Palazzo Venezia took 10 minutes, from there you can stroll towards the Colosseum, admiring the various ruins along the avenue. We booked the hotel to be away from the worst of the huzzle and buzzle and it worked out fine. All in all, we were happy with the hotel, our non-smoking room was indeed non-smoking (no old smell of cigarettes in our room) and the air condition was able to chill the room so much that we had to turn it back. Just a tip, if you check with the tourist information at Fiumicino airport's train station area, you can get a airport shuttle directly to the hotel, the number to call when you need a shuttle back, is toll free, so you can call them on day in advance from your hotel room and book a shuttle with no problems. (the trip to the hotel from the airport with the shuttle, took about 25 minutes and our shuttle was on time +-3 minutes to our booking time). Also, while still in the airport, pop in to the tourist information desk and buy a Roma pass, it cost \u20ac25 and gives you a 3 day pass on all public communication, maps and a ticket that give you free entrance to two of the sites in Rome (+50% off additional sites you want to visit).", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, KY", "Title": "\u201cOver-Rated, High Priced & NOT Handicap-Friendly!\u201d", "Author": "EdenSprings", "ReviewID": "UR37733396", "Content": "Traveled with friends (one in a wheelchair) to Rome.

While the bathrooms do have wheel-in showers, (we stayed in 2 different H/C rooms) one offered dual rails at the toilet and had sufficient room to wheel in and out, the other was a joke. You needed to wheel down a short, narrow hallway with a sharp turn at the end, and then there was NO ROOM for the chair anywhere. We had to shove furniture out of the way to get the chair close enough to the bed to transfer! You needed to shut the bathroom door to wheel past the bathroom to get into the hallway (there wasn't enough room for the door to open flat against the wall) in order to get in/out of the room. The extreme turn you needed to make into the bathroom required the chair to be manually LIFTED, and there wasn't enough room in the bath for the chair, so transfers to the toilet required several steps. There was no room in the bath to turn the chair, so exiting required backing out.

Rome is swarming with people, and I understand it's like that any time of year! Some of our favorites: Piazza Navona (at night when musicians perform), St. Peter's (awesome), Trevi Fountain and Pantheon (almost unbelievable!) If you can afford it, I would recommend taking a private tour. In five hours you will learn more history and see more sights than on your own; we used Rome Limos Tours run by the Miglio family and it was fantastic. Rome is expensive for Americans, especially the restaurants. It is awe inspiring to see these ancient sights and the city is vibrant and exciting.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cRooms and service variable but close to the Vatican\u201d", "Author": "Chiquitawonder", "ReviewID": "UR30247931", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel in the middle of May.

We didnt think highly of the hotel until we returned a couple of days later after staying at other starhotels in Venice and Florence. On our return we were upgraded (without asking) to an executive room. The experience was totally different. The executive room was very nice. Separate living room. Bathroom had a nice tub. Didnt have to worry about the water running all over the place. The key to getting an executive room is by requesting a king bed. Otherwise you'll get stuck with a standard room with 2 beds.

We selected this hotel through a vacation package offered by Travelocity. The hotel is quite convenient for access to The Vatican (where we spent a lot of time), and other locations as well, especially if you're willing to walk or take public transportation (which we did). We were initially taken aback when we first arrived at the hotel's location. This was primarily due to aesthetic reasons; we failed to realize beforehand that Rome in general, despite its picturesque settings, is thousands of years old and looks like it. Cars are jammed packed together, trash dumpsters line the street right outside the hotel, and litter is quite prevalent. On top of that the hotel staff was NOT overly friendly and they did not come across as being dedicated to making sure our stay at their hotel was a top priority. The first room we were assigned reinforced our opinion that we (I) had selected the wrong hotel, especially for the pre-paid money we had put up. The carpet was worn, both seats of the chairs in the room were heavily stained and one had its fabric torn, and the walls were heavily marked with luggageg scrape marks. After complaining to the manager, he had a bellhop show us another room that was better (hardwood floors instead of carpet), but was still not up to what I would expect for a 4-star hotel. On the positive side, the bathrooms were great! I really appreciated the US electrical plug. Breakfast was included in the room rate, and its buffet was wide ranging, very good, and quite plentiful. We ate their every morning. We never ate lunch in the hotel, but we did eat dinner there once, and would never do it again. We paid the equivalent of $190+ dollars for dinner for 2, with a half carafe of wine. The food, its quality, and the service may have been worth half that much, and that is being generous. We ate dinner at a very nice restaurant across the river for about the same amount, and it was well worth the expense and the experience. By the way, we walked to and from the restaurant during numerous nightime escapades, and felt completely safe each time. All in all, for the rates we paid, and the service we received, I would be reluctant to stay at this hotel again, especially if it was to celebrate another milestone in our marriage. If I was on a business trip with business near The Vatican, I probably would stay here again.

The only things going for this hotel are the location and the clean room. If you need anything else from the hotel, you're out of luck! The service from the reception desk was awful. Each time we asked the desk for something, the answer was, \"No!\". My family and I couldn't believe how rude the staff was at this hotel. They were completely unaccommodating. We stayed at other hotels in other cities throughout Italy, and we found this hotel to be the worst in customer relations. First of all, the hotel gives you a key on a key chain the weight of a small dumbbell and they encourage you to leave it with them at the desk when you leave. We asked them to supply a second key and they said, \"No!\". So each time we left the hotel, we left the key at the desk. FYI - there was no safe on the hotel rooms. Then when we returned to the hotel, we would ask for our room key from an entirely different set of staff and they would give it to us without asking to see any identification. I felt uneasy leaving the key and without having them check to see if we were really staying in the hotel. Anyone could ask for a key from the desk and get one. We asked to have an iron sent to our room and was rudely told, \"No!\". The hotel reception desk told us that it's against the law in Italy to have an iron in your room. We were unaware of this \"law\" because we had an iron sent to our rooms in other hotels we stayed at throughout Italy and was never told \"no\" or that is was against the law. Since we couldn't borrow an iron, we asked if there was an ironing service and we were told, \"It's too late!\" So the next day we asked for ironing service earlier in the day and was given a hard time by the reception desk once again. They looked at us like we were asking for something unheard of. We proceeded to wait as the reception desk called for the maid. After, they said we would have to wait one hour and that the cost is 12 Euros per piece! We said no thanks. We decided to wear wrinkled clothes. The \"American breakfast buffet\" was disgusting! The eggs were made of powder and looked fake as they were bright yellow in color. How hard is it to mess up powdered eggs? They were runny and made me feel nauseous when I ate them for the first time. The breads they served were a strange tasting croissants and a loaf of breads. The meat they served was greasy and undercooked. My husband, who has a bad stomach was sick after eating breakfast the first morning. After that, he ate bread with butter the next two days. I was hoping the coffee would be good, but I was disappointed again! The coffee was awful too! I opted to eat the cold cereal and drank the juice instead. The service at breakfast was lacking as well. There was a number of staff walking around the dining room, however not one of the staff members on the three mornings we were there, asked if everything was okay. The hotel was booked of people on a Globus tour. You will see the Globus tour people at breakfast if you go early enough. It seems that the Starhotels Michelangelo is more concerned with packing out there hotel with people rather than taking care of them. Do not ask the reception desk for recommendations for restaurants, they will guide you to expensive restaurants that have mediocre food. You are better off reading other people's trip reports. The location of the hotel is perfect if you want to focus your Rome trip on the Vatican. The room was clean and comfortable. Starhotels Michelangelo desperately needs to work on their service.

Since we checked in with prepaid hotel voucher, there is really no incentive for the hotel to show/sell us the better rooms. We appreciate their offers! The 7th floor rooms (703 and 709) are very well decorated. The bath room are with marble/granite (or look like). It also comes with slipper, bathrobe, chocolate and a good selection of tea/coffee/cappucino/chocolate powder to make you own drinks (with an electric kettle to boil water). I will rate the room as 4 stars. However, there is one drawback. The rooms are warm with no air condition for this time of the year, so I often open the window. The front desk is nice but could be friendlier, part of it can be due to the language barrier. The staff speaks English but I do ask a lot of questions, so they get a little impatient. The breakfast was nice, with a big table with repeated selections on both end. We never encounter a line there even when the restaurant was filled with other guests. The easist way to get around town is to take the bus (46, 571, 916). Exit the hotel, turn left, make another left on the next block. It's less than 5 minute walk. On your way there, you pass a pastry store (BonCaffe?), you can get Gelato for 1 Europe. We enjoy that a lot! Also, buy a map with bus route (3 Euro). That will help you a lot knowing where to get on/off. All the major tourist spots are a short ride away (10-15 minutes). Be ready for the crowded bus though. The hotel is so close to St. Peters. It is within a 5-minute walk. take the same direction above, but make right after 1 block. There is a pedestrain underground walkway with sign. We walked to St. Peters multiple times because it is so close. Take some bread/cookies with you, you can feed the pigeons at St. Peters square. I had taken several photos with pigeons picking food from my wife's palm. There is also a Green Cafe diagonal across from the hotel. Nothing fancy but nice neighborhood atmosphere with good prices. It offers pastry, sandwiches, drink and the coffee/latte etc. One complaints about the Rome. We use a limo service with a counter right at the FCO Rome airport (with a sign stating they are official limo/transport). We got charge 90 on the way to the hotel and 35 back. We overpaid about 25 Euros when compare using the taxi. The Italian tourist desk at the airport is no help. You are supposed to be charged 40 Euro if you live with the \"wall\". This hotel is just outside the wall, so you should expect to pay just a little more. In fact, the hotel can arrange for transportation for 52/47 Euros (can't remember which way, one is to pick up, one is to drop off). 25 is nothing, but I hate to be taking advantage of.

Ours was lovely, however, and had all of the expected amenities (hairdryer, mini-bar, etc.). With a bit of effort, I could see the dome of St. Peter's from my window. In fact, we walked to St. Peter's square each evening since it was only 3 blocks away (there is also a taxi stand in the square). Most surprising was the breakfast: Eggs, bacon and ham, wonderful cheeses and jams, cereals, and predictably marvelous bread. What a way to start our day! There is a great neighborhood restaurant (La Vittoria or Il Vittorio, I've forgotten which) that anyone staying here will enjoy. There is a bus stop two blocks away, and the number 7 gets you close to many popular tourist attractions. If I'm ever in Rome again, I'll head immediately to this hotel.", "Date": "July 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "No. California", "Title": "\u201cVery nice base for Rome vacation\u201d", "Author": "MK_Cal", "ReviewID": "UR3615625", "Content": "We stayed in an executive room and found the Starhotels Michelangelo a very nice base for our stay in Rome. The staff was very helpful, arranging transportation, and offering good suggestions for nearby restaurants. The room was on the larger size, by European standards, and we found the location quiet and restful. The building looks very dated on the outside but the interior has been updated and is kept in good order. The computer in the lobby was a huge benefit !! The cleaning staff needs a stronger vacum for cleaning the very low pile carpeting but that one issue did not detract from our stay at the hotel. It is near the Vatican and also near the 64 line so getting to other locations in Rome is easy. The days were 25-30 degrees C and the AC was able to keep the room very comfortable at night. Breakfast was more than sufficient and had much variety. We found that in general Italy does pasta well but morning breakfast sweets and breads are not the same quality as those in France! So in general don't expect the breakfast breads to be remarkable. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel & will definately stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, IN", "Title": "\u201cIf good air conditioning is a must, then stay elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3540378", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights in May/June 2005. the air conditioning worked fine during the day, but at nighttime both my husband and I awoke (every night) due to the heat (if felt like AT LEAST 80 F).

Staff were helpful and polite, breakfasts had good selection of hot and cold food. Such a short walk to the vatican is definately a plus and it only takes 20mins walk to centre of rome.Get a good map and walk to ancient rome you see more and really get the feel of this memorable city. Had a bad experience with the taxi from termini as we gave him a 50 euro note and he turned round and in a flash the 50 was a 10 this caused confusion and loss of money on our first hours in rome. The hotel booked a taxi for our return trip to the airport and it was only 47euro I would suggest you ring the hotel and ask for them to book a taxi for when you arrive they have a special deal with a company. Also watch the snack bars some charge 4euro for coffee, we got charged 6.80 euro for a danish and heard lots of rip off tales like this.", "Date": "May 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, KY", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "lesliedee", "ReviewID": "UR3292327", "Content": "This hotel is spectacular.

I should say the breakfast was ok, but the place really needs a remodel. Staff is not too friendly, the bar is incredibly overpriced. If you stay there, be warned there are lots of pickpockets at the bus stop around the corner. If you want to stay at a great hotel, the StarHotel Anderson in Milan was 100% different than this one.

There are many excellent features about this hotel. It is in a very quite neighborhood, with many neighborhood amenities (markets, wine stores, pastry shop, etc.). The thing that drew me to the hotel is that it is one of few that offers full size/queen size beds instead of the all too common single beds found in medium priced Italian hotels. The room is a bit small by U.S. standards but adequate, all guest services and hotel staff were excellent. A nice surprise was the included full breakfast being available as room service for a 2.50 Euro surcharge. The only major issue I had with the hotel is that the carpet in the room needed cleaning badly, actually should be replaced, and that the room really needed a coat of paint due to scuffs, nicks, scrapes etc. The advertised \"in room wireless internet\" was absurdly priced at 22 Euros per day, and the TV based service through the hotel was about .25 Euros per minute. The hotel did however provide a free computer and printer with 24 hour access for the use of guests in the lobby. The location was great for St. Peters, but was an average 7 Euro taxi ride from most of the \"tourist\" spots.
