I can say that the Park Inn by Radisson Dallas Love Field does not approach these levels. The hotel is old, there's no other way to say that. While the lobby seems to have new furniture, overall the facility had a distinct \"80's Convention/Wedding\" feel to it. An old hotel isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as guest rooms have been updated appropriately. In my case, they have not. Upon entering my room, I was hit, full force, with the overwhelming smell of cigarettes. It permeated everything in the room. There was no attempt to deodorize or mask the smell either... even the AC unit reeked. I can not overstate this enough: despite the 100% smoke free policy listed on the website, I have never, ever stayed in a hotel room that smelled so strongly of smoke. The room I stayed in did not in any way resemble the photos on the website or located here. My room was dark, poorly lit, and seemed to be assembled from 80's era hotel furniture. The lighting was particularly bad, with only four desk style lamps for the entire room. The sink/mirror had one fluorescent bulb above. The TV was a large LCD. There were two armchairs, which I sat in briefly but worried about transferring the smoke smell to my suit. The bed in particular was awful. The mattress was rock hard, very old, and I was able to feel individual springs through the sheets. Both the left and right sides of the bed mattress had LARGE indentations of past guests. We're talking noticeable depressions in the mattress that one could roll into. These mattresses had clearly not been changed in many years, if not decades. When I reported these issues to the front desk, the maintenance man said it smelled like someone *may* have been smoking in the room, and that due to a convention, the entire hotel was completely sold out and they would be unable to move me. Had I not been traveling for work and paid for the room personally, I would have immediately checked out and stayed elsewhere. Weirdly, for a hotel with two restaurants, there was no room service menu or breakfast ordering door-hangers. One of the windows (not designed to open) was VERY drafty during the windy night I was there... which I only realized from the curtains fluttering in a breeze that should not have existed. There was a rubber duck in the bathtub, and a small packet of gummy bears. Still, this in no way made up for the weird lack of updating this hotel has done. Note: every staff member I interacted with was VERY friendly, but couldn't make up for the complete lack of physical quality in the establishment. The horror stories about bad rooms are not exaggerations. I would absolutely NOT stay in this hotel again.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cFantastic value\u201d", "Author": "GMDWashington_DC", "ReviewID": "UR127136112", "Content": "Bottom line: it was a great deal for the money and I would absolutely stay again. After reading the reviews, I called Hotwire and asked for a different hotel. I was told that it was rated consistently as a 3-star so I cautiously agreed to try it out. Yes, some of the furniture is outdated. They are making genuine attempts to modernize on a budget -- a pop of color here, a modern chair there. Most of the modernization has taken place in the lobby. They have the best hotel hair dryer that I've ever used. Yes, there are scratches on the door frames and other minor cosmetic deficiencies but I didn't care. Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old school TV but it worked. I had everything I needed -- including great staff, free wi-fi, pool, free shuttle that goes w/in a 5-mile radius, and restaurants on the property (I had lunch there: the soup was a little heavy but the baked potato was loaded up -- tons of cheese, bacon, butter, & sour cream on the side. The bar/restaurant looked nice too but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the chance to visit.) I appreciate that they tried to be different: Instead of chocolate on your pillow, there were gummy bears. There was also a rubber duckie on the tub. No continental breakfast, but coffee in the lobby with fresh oranges and apples (the orange was delicious). If you want a regular mattress, they are all located in what used to be the smoking rooms. I had a great night's sleep on the Sleep Number bed. I fiddled with the settings and it was comfortable to me. I agree that a tower rooms are quieter because the pool is located in the courtyard that is surrounded by the main building. My ONLY concern is that the shuttle doors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem secure upon closing.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lubbock, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot 3 star\u201d", "Author": "saqsaq", "ReviewID": "UR126688192", "Content": "Got a ridiculously low price of $37 on priceline and then was still able to park at the hotel for a week free of charge so I hate to complain but this place is not 3 stars. It is a very dated property with long, dark, dingy hallways. The sleep number beds were not comfortable at all. We had to change rooms because the first one reeked of cigarette smoke even though they said the entire property is smoke free. The staff are incredibly nice and helpful but that is where the postives end. There is a parking garage but when we went, there was not one car in the garage. We were a little concerned to leave our car in the garage but the staff said that the only reason noone parks there is because you can't access the hotel from the garage. Our car was fine after a week. There was a complimentary shuttle to Love Field and it was quick to pick us back up when we returned a week later. It's just an older property that needs a major facelift. Carpet was worn and bathroom was old and very small.

After reading so many negative reviews I was horrified. Especially the parts about the mold and smoking smells because our whole family suffers from allergies. However, happily, the room was not at all what we expected. Yes, it was dated, the TV was old and not flat screen, but the room was very clean, no spots on the carpet, no funny smells and no indication of anyone ever smoking in there. The air conditioner was a little on a noisy side, but I find it not much different from other hotel rooms we visited. The bathroom was small but clean.

Never failing to offer assistance when asked or if you looked confused. I never had to deal with bad customer service or bad attitudes. It was all smiles and helpfulness. I personally felt the room was quite impressive. Two chairs, Two Sleep Number Beds, restroom with shower/tub combo, external sink and mirror (not inside the bathroom), plenty of counter space and room for your belongings. It even had a closet. The room was very nice..A++++ When I first saw the lobby I was afraid I would be turning around and not coming back, but after seeing the room, I'm glad I stayed. I would describe this hotel as warm and welcoming. Great customer service and very very clean! Pros: Excellent customer service, shuttle, room service *20% gratuity and a delivery charge though are a little over the top in my opinion, but it's a nice option*, very clean, very safe, pool, quiet, yet accessible to many restaurants and shopping..I could go on and on.about the positives of this hotel and I will Definitely stay here again. Cons: No mini fridge/microwave and in my opinion the sleep number beds were not all that great comfort wise, but I do appreciate the effort though. I rested well, but I wasn't impressed with sleep number beds I guess. I don't like firm beds.

Within an hour of arrival in my musty-smelling room, my nose was completely sealed shut and closed from what I can only presume to be the overwhelming mold I presume to be present from the musty smell. The \"free\" wireless internet here has ALWAYS been an adventure, with wireless routers set up in a couple of rooms on (I believe) every other floor. I constantly loose connectivity and experience VERY slow speeds. They USED to put out free coffee from 5-6 AM, but even this has now gone by the wayside. And with the restaurant not opening until 7 AM, you have one cup of in-room coffee, and that's it til 7AM. The work desk chair is horribly cheap and will not stay elevated. Sitting in the work desk chair, I think my seat is about seven or eight inches off of the ground. OLD antique TVs with VERY poor reception and a very limited channel lineup. The bathrooms are micro tiny and very dingy. The street noise from Mockingbird Dr. is CRAZY loud, and the gimmicky \"sleep number\" beds are EXTREMELY uncomfortable. The air conditioning/heating unit makes enough noise to wake the dead. I don't even know they waste time with the tiny pillows - the compress under the weight of your head to paper-thin. They need to cut with the \"renovations\" (read: Paint) and just raze this place and start from scratch. They even had to close the parking area on one side of the hotel, for reasons not really known. Spend a few more dollars and book at another hotel in Market Center. Believe me, you'll be glad you did. For some reason, the online hotel bid and booking site I used calls this a three-star hotel.
