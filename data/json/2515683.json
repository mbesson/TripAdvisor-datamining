We stayed in a room facing Balboa Park, on the first floor. The room had a very warm, homey feel. Kind of like staying in the guestroom at your grandmothers house. The bathroom was large, with a jacuzzi tub. it was kind of weird that the mini-fridge, microwave, and other kitchen supplies were in the bathroom, but we got over it. There is a Trader Joe's nearby where you can stock up on microwave-cooked foods. The daily breakfast was nice, they were always very friendly when you called and ordered. Always a great job cleaning the rooms when you're out for the day. The Inn is right across the street from Balboa Park. We jogged through the park every night. We walked to the San Diego Zoo easily. There is also a bus stop right there that goes in Downtown San Diego, convenient way to avoid drinking/driving at night. The parking is sreet parking, and it can be tricky, but I stay in North Jersey a lot so it was really no big deal, just like home. There is always somewhere to park, it just always isn't right in front of your hotel. The staff was great and friendly, they were able to hook us up with a nicer room upon check-in for no extra cost. We originally were going to be in one room for 2 nights, then switch to a smaller room for the remaining nights.

It didn't seem to work so I called down to the front desk for a fan. After obtaining the fan, I checked out the A/C myself and found it to work. You can't leave everything to the husbands.

The location is so peaceful [except on the morning of the Rock & Roll Marathon which goes right by the building at Mile 2, and then the location's just plain fun], and the neighborhood's so tranquil compared to the congestion and stress of the big hotels along the marina. Every room in the Inn is different. We've stayed twice in City Lights, which is on the 2nd floor, has a couch & kitchenette, and very nice view out to the street. We've also stayed in the Jungle Room, which is wild, has a much larger bathroom, and is also memorable, but is on the first floor, opens out onto the center patio and therefore has little natural light if you're going to be hanging out during the day. The breakfast that's provided at the Inn is very tasty -- although could use some fresh fruit. It includes cereal, juice, coffee & assorted pastries, and is brought to your room anytime after 7:30 am, which is also a very nice touch [would be better for the business traveler, however, if it could be available by 7 am]. The inn is actually several 2-story homes/apartment buildings all linked together on the corner across from Balboa Park at the Zoo [expect the bathrooms to be 'vintage' as a result], so it has an especially homey feel. You could live there indefinitely and not feel that you're in a hotel. The room across the hall from City Lights, in fact, has a living room, kitchen and bedroom -- it's a full-on apartment. No matter which room you take, if you have to be in San Diego for business or pleasure, couldn't recommend this B&B more! Parking's free on the street -- although sometimes difficult to find -- and the stay will make you want to stay longer.

So we picked this wonderfully charming hotel to spend a few days together alone. We chose the Balboa Park Inn, mostly because of it close proximity to Balboa Park and one of our favorite restaurants The Prado. We checked out a few of the other themed rooms the Inn had to offer, each had its own unique flavor and exquisite furnishings. We were impressed by their attention to details and after much deliberations we settled on their very best room the Tara Suite. The suite was very spacious, beautifully & uniquely decorated, the furnishings were even more impressive starting with a fancy gold silk down filled Sherrill sofa to relax on, a wonderful Empire style Century Furniture dresser for our clothes with the matching desk, a beautiful Theodore Alexander accent chair with the matching console...no cheap particle wood hotel furnishings here. The entire suite was impressive to say the least. As you continue through to the rear of the suite you are surrounded by the romantic aroma of scented candles all around you (all electric and remote controlled). In the corner is a large bar with all the kitchen amenities discreetly tucked behind it, a microwave, coffee pot and wine glasses. But the best part about this suite is the oversized jacuzzi and European style bathroom all so cleaned it looked brand new as if we were the first to use them. The bathroom was unique in that it had no door! Just a simple wall defining the private space. There were two showers next to the jacuzzi one was a big rain shower head which was great to use. The room was so nice we spent more time inside than out. The service was outstanding. The staff is very knowledgeable, pleasant, and helpful at any hour.

Ethics. Most hotels have a 24 or 48 hour cancellation policy. This is fair to the consumer. Balboa Park Inn has a 7 day cancellation policy and is adamant about enforcing the policy regardless of if you are even 1 hr late or to cancel the reservation. Hotels, in my opinion, are there to serve the customer. By the actions of Ed Wilcox, Manager/Owner, it is clear that he places his priority on himself -- not the customer. In my conversation with Mr. Wilcox he was quite thin skinned and unprofessional (specifically; patronizing/hostile-politeness) -- like a person who has had far too many 'conversations' regarding his policy and has become resentful of his customers. NEWS FLASH: Mr. Wilcox -- the resentment you feel is a direct consequence of your approach to your customers. In writing this review I feel bad for all parties. My mother in law is out around $400/ usd and the Balboa Park Inn has earned a terrible review.

I wouldn't recommend this room for anyone that likes spaciousness or have lots of bags. The bathroom on the other hand is HUGE, it's about 1/2 the size of the bedroom! It's got a jacuzzi with bubble oil supplied. The room is well equipped with: dishes, bowls, utensils, fridge, coffee maker, coffee, tea, ironing board + iron and hairdryer. There's also an ice box in the courtyard. The free wi-fi internet was also a plus and much appreciated. We found the courtyard decorated with lots of plants and small ornaments really charming. It was a nice little place to sit and enjoy breakfast. The breakfast consisted of juice, pastries, and cereals. The pastry basket only has 4 pieces of pastries. The croissant and mini muffins were the best, so try getting extras. Conveniently located next to the zoo and close to Balboa park. In fact, it's probably a 10 minute walk to the zoo if you don't want to drive and find parking. Balboa park is also very close by and a must-see. I wish we had more time to spend at the beautiful park. Street parking (on the side street) was never an issue with us, but if you park on the main street, be sure to read the signs as they wash the streets and you can't park on a certain side on a certain day. We were very pleased with the price of this place. After doing lots of research on the web, I think Balboa Park Inn is truly exceptional for the value. Next time we're in SD, I'll probably book this place again, but with a different room (not because I didn't like Aruba, but because the other rooms look beautiful as well). Someone mentioned that this isn't really a bed & breakfast, but more like a 'hotel'. I would have to agree that it's not the conventional 'bed & breakfast', because you don't get to meet the owners and it doesn't really feel like a 'house'.

The off-street parking is free and right next to the Inn. There is super easy freeway access for trips to Old Town, the beaches, downtown. You can literally walk comfortably into the Zoo and Balboa Park as it is just a few blocks away. The Inn is a actually three apartment buildings, vintage 1920s (?), which together occupy nearly a quarter block (clearly enough for a super mega development like some of the towers in the vicinity). A series of \"interior courtyard\" decks connect the three, some at ground level, and others at the second story level, depending on whether a room is at the ground or second story level. The two levels connect via a central stairway. There are some distant views at the second level out to the surrounding areas. WE give the Inn an A++ for laudible and appropriate investments in terms of overall comfort based on our experience in a two-bedroom unit. The mattresses, bedding and linens are of exellent quality. There are flat screen televisions. The housekeepers do a superb job. The exterior patio furniture itself is updated and solid. But in total, it kind of doesn't quite add up, and we'd give it a BBBBB for atmosphere and ambiance overall. We weren't impressed with the plastic flowers or the light blue color scheme which decorated the deck area, too JC Penney for the location.

I found the furniture and decor (including ample bouquets of artificial flowers) pretty tacky/kitschy, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and in any case this did not put me off the hotel, which was very clean, comfortable and homey. Fair warning, though \u2013 if you\u2019re a traveler who enjoys the sleek monotony of a corporate chain hotel, if you\u2019re a design guru, or if you consider tastefulness to be next to Godliness, this probably isn\u2019t the hotel for you.

We were able to enjoy San Diego\u2019s famous climate by keeping the windows open at all times and we slept soundly in quiet comfort. It appears that each suite has a different configuration, so those wanting a large, luxurious bathroom should choose a different suite, but the layout and amenities were fine for the two of us. A hair dryer, iron, ironing board and all such necessities were provided. I was particularly impressed with how well-stocked the kitchen was, with a full range of Kitchenaid pots, pans and utensils, in addition to the dishes, coffee maker, fridge, range, microwave, etc. It felt like we were staying not in a hotel but in someone\u2019s small and old but well-maintained apartment. This feeling is amplified by the fact that the hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood and not the bustling downtown. The location means you can\u2019t just step out of your hotel room and have your choice of restaurants and shops within blocks, but if you enjoy walking it\u2019s a reasonable and pleasant walk to the Hillcrest area which is full of options for eating and shopping. I enjoyed walking past the charming little bungalows and cottages of all different styles that make up the neighborhood.

We were graciously granted special consideration to meet our particular and unique needs, a level of customer service that is very much appreciated, and unique.

They do nearly everything just right. Starting with location, the Inn is located across the street from Balboa Park. We are from NY and in our 30s so we enjoy walking very much. We walked to the Zoo in 10 minutes and the Old Globe Theater in 15 minutes. Just a few blocks north is Hilcrest: an energetic gay-friendly neighborhood with plenty of dining options. The front staff at the hotel were extremely pleasant and genuinely kind. Check-in was very prompt and we were personally escorted to our room (which is necessary because there are 3 buildings). We stayed in the Harlequin room which was clean, cozy and very large. There was a large kitchen - stocked with coffee, cocoa and condiments. The plates and mugs were cute and mildly kitchy. There was a living room with a couch, two chairs, a glass coffee table and a desk with a flat-screen TV. I would have liked a smaller coffee table or a little more space in that room but that is a minor complaint. The bedroom was simple: a queen bed, windows on 2 sides, a large bureau and a closet. The bed was extremely comfortable, the pillows were soft and there was little noise - I slept great both nights. The only negative things about the bedroom was that there was no mirror and the closet was located behind the bedroom door which had to be closed in order to access the closet. Also, there was no full length mirror in the whole place, unfortunately. The bathroom was small and no-frills but clean and it worked fine for us. There was a small balcony that we shared with the folks next to us. The view from the balcony is not impressive but it is always nice to sit outside regardless. There is also a 2nd story terrace where people eat breakfast, smoke and sit in the hammock. The staff will bring free breakfast to your room or to the terrace very morning. The breakfast was find: cereal, juice and a pastry. It should also be known that the hotel does not provide parking. We never had to drive around for more than 5 minutes to find a spot and we we always found a spot on the block. Overall, it's a great place to stay - especially if you will be going to the Zoo and Balboa Park. It is also close to all major highways for a quick drive to many of the amazing beaches in San Diego.

We spent three nights in the Beach House room, which was relatively secluded and devoid of outside noise. Getting to the Beach House required a walk through a narrow \"canyon\" between two buildings whose sides are heavily covered with undisguised pipes (for water, gas, etc.). The path continued through a narrow, cluttered courtyard. We noticed that some of the planters still had price stickers still on them. The Beach House room door had frosted glass inserts that were worn in places, potentially enabling outsiders to look all around the room. We tore off pieces of paper and stuck them in the window frames for greater privacy. The room itself was decorated in a mostly tropical theme and there was a mural on one wall. The room also contained a small LCD TV (we could not get any of the HD channels), three fake trees (the one by the bed looked like it was made from an old Christmas tree), an air purifier, and a mini-fridge. Both appliances made a noticeable hum that eventually became distracting. The window fan/heater/AC unit was very noisy and the controls were hard to reach. There are mini-blinds and curtains on the windows. The blinds and sheers close but the opaque curtains do not. That could be a problem for folks who require greater darkness for sleep. There is abundant light for reading, but the two wicker chaise lounges have slippery cushions on them. As for cleanliness, the room was immaculate except for a silverfish crawling across the bedspread (ugh!), some well-worn brochures on the bureau, and a sponge left on the bathroom floor. Speaking of the bathroom, it is spacious, contains lots of mirrors and plush towels, and features a jacuzzi with a mirrored, faux-candle-lit surround. Directions for the jacuzzi are too brief and confusing to be helpful. (A desk clerk was unable to decipher them.) The shower stall is roomy but hot water can be slow in coming. The amenities include body lotion that smells very strongly of peppermint. There are dozens of gaudy, artsys-craftsy fish hanging from the ceiling. We thought they might look cute in a child's room.

The hotel is also only a short drive from a number of restaurants and grocery stores -- not too far from I-5 (main interstate thorough-fare) -- and only 12 minutes from the airport.

This is an excellent place. The room was a good size, bed was comfortable and all the staff were friendly and helpful. In fact the cleaner even found a necklace which we had left in our room on check out. The hotel provides some nice touches like daily newspaper delivered to your room. I have struggled to find anything negative to mention. However I've come up with some advice should you consider staying here. - Breakfast - Breakfast is a choice of either cereals or croissants and buns. Both options come with fresh fruit. The croissants and buns are particular good, highly recommended. It is nice that they will deliver the breakfast to your room or outside terrace. However after about 3 or 4 days the options do become a bit repetitive. - Water pressure - The water pressure in the shower wasn't as powerful as ideally I would have liked. Although I'm sure this is outside of the hotel's control. - Location - The hotel location is good, but possibly not for everyone. If you don't drive (I don't) please consider the following. I considered the hotel to be in good safe neighbourhood and I felt safe when walking around the area at all times of day or night. It appears to be quite a residential area. The hotel is a 90 second walk to a bus stop for route 7 which runs into downtown. The bus service runs quite frequently about every 12 minutes in the day, and about every 20 minutes in the evening. It takes about 10 minutes to City College where you can transfer on to the San Diego trolley. The hotel is about 10 minute walk south to San Diego Zoo, Rose Garden and a few more minutes to attractions like the model railway museum. 10 minutes walk north of the hotel on to university avenue is Starbucks, 7 11, other restaurants and bars. From university avenue you can catch bus 10 to old town. - Flowers - The flowers in the room are artificial. Not a problem, but might be worth noting. - Pizza delivery - Like a lot of places Balboa Park Inn provides some local information leaflets in the room. One was for the Broadway Pizza delivery service. We decided to use this one night. I have never tasted such a terrible pizza. Obviously this isn't the hotel fault, but I wouldn't recommend ordering from Broadway Pizza during your stay. - Overall - Overall Balboa Park is an excellent choice at a very fair price. I would certainly recommend it and would definitely stay there again. The only reason I've given 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hotel is a 10 minutes walk from shops, restaurants and bars. But I was aware of this when booking, so this wasn't really a problem.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWe Love The Balboa Park Inn!!!\u201d", "Author": "MEKWisconsin", "ReviewID": "UR16356546", "Content": "We have just returned from our fourth visit and will most definitely stay here again.

It was a good size for us. It was essentially a very small apartment with a full kitchen (minus dishwasher), small dining room table, bedroom, and living room area. There was a tiny outdoor area too. Not really a deck, but sort of an enclosure. My son enjoyed running his trains and cars out there and I didn't have to worry about him because it's fenced from the street. PROS: --Close to everything. We rented a car and our longest drive was 12 minutes to Coronado. Balboa Park, Old Town, downtown, and the charming Hillcrest neighborhood were all very close. If I didn't have a small child, I wouldn't have rented a car at all. THe public transport there is great. --Very accommodating staff.. There were a few things missing from the kitchen (knife, pancake turner, hot pads) and they delivered them to the room one at a time, as I discovered what I needed. They gave me lots of recommendations and directions to places and were very friendly. And they were willing to let me have housekeeping every other day, instead of every day. I don't like to waste the water it takes to change all the bedding and towels every day (which I would never do in my own home!) and because I feel compelled to tidy up for the cleaning staff, it's less work for me if I don't have to worry about them coming in every day. --Inexpensive. It's hard to find a 1-bedroom with a full kitchen anywhere else in San Diego for under $200. Having a kitchen saves a lot of money too. We ate many breakfasts and dinners in the room, paying only to eat out for lunch while we were sightseeing. --Clean. The place was kept quite clean. --Easy and free parking. In a week, we only had two times we had a hard time finding a parking space on Upas St. Once, on Earth Day, when 60,000 people came to Balboa Park and took up a LOT of parking spaces! And the other on a day when we came back to the room at about 3 pm and there were cars lining the street with parents in them, waiting to pick up their kids from the middle school across the street. In both cases, we drove around the block 3 or 4 times and finally found a space in front of the inn. Not really a big deal. I must say that San Diego in general is a nirvana of free parking. I come from Seattle, land of expensive pay parking, so it was amazing to me that there was lots of free parking at Balboa Park, the zoo, Old Town, Coronado beaches. We never once paid for parking. Try that when you go to Seattle Center or Pike Place Market! CONS: --The rooms in the California Suite were very small. The bedroom pretty much only had room for the bed and night stands. I had a pack-and-play in there and it was wedged between the bed and wall and you couldn't walk around it. The dining area was also cramped and I think it would be difficult to seat 4 people there. The kitchen had very little prep room. For the price, we didn't mind, but if you had more than 3 people, it would probably be too cramped. --The smell of the cleaning solutions they use were pretty overpowering, as several people have pointed out. I opened all the windows and the door to air it out the night we got there and by morning, it was better. The fabulous thing though is that all I had to do was mention it to the front desk and they arranged for the cleaners not to use anything smelly while I was there. Problem solved easily and painlessly. --Noise in our room. Our room was at the bottom of the staircase, right next to the main door for our building, so we heard every guest come in (slam!) and leave (slam!) and haul their luggage up and down the steps (bump, bump, bump). Fortunately, when we had the bedroom door shut, we couldn't hear it. Mostly we just heard it while we were up and around. But if you have a baby who needs to nap during the day, it's something to think about. Overall, we had a great time and I plan to go back to the Balboa Park Inn as soon as I can afford it.

She should have seen Jungle Nook (#28) with its bronze gorilla perched over the jacuzzi, a jaguar by the breakfast nook, and a huge elephant head with tusks suspended over the bed. The assessment for this hotel/inn/motel (it defies description but the sign on the building says \"unique bed and breakfast\") is based primarily on Jungle Nook and a few observations on the management team. But first of all, the location right near Balboa Park is excellent. You do not even need a car. Bus #7 can take you either to the zoo or to the Museum Place (one direction) or to Central Station (the other). Bus tickets are $2.25 general and $1.00 seniors. I have never found such friendly and helpful people as on the bus. Well done! If you elect to eat in the park, the Cohn Brothers' Prado restaurant is one of the best in town. The bar menu is served all day and will save you half the dinner fare. The restaurant itself, Mediterannean fare, will run $100 for two, with drinks and a full meal. Excellent variety from duck quesadillas to mushroom risotto. So much has already been said about the quirkiness of the rooms but I need to mention specifically the lack of seating in Jungle Nook. There are no chairs in the bedroom. If you wish to sit, there is a table with two chairs in--get ready--the huge bathroom. This is a room with double shower and enormous jacuzzi tub. (Remember the lines \"water, water, everywhere\"?) To the side of this room is the breakfast table. You will be able to nibble at pastries and cereal while watching the two bath options outfitted with jaguar and gorilla. There is a separate bathroom with dual sinks and toilet (no chairs here but there is a hat rack, if you wish). Yes, you can have your breakfast outside and I would encourage you to do so if the weather is nice. You call to have breakfast brought to you, and you call when you wish your room to be serviced. There is NO window in the Jungle Nook, unless you count the tiny windows over the jacuzzi which can be opened only by scaling the tiles behind the tub. I do need to mention that Paris in the 30's, at a far lower rate, is delightful and airy. Claustrophobes need not worry. But Sunday night there might be some major concern with the management team. We needed to phone the front desk Sunday night at 7:30 PM. There was no one. At 8:30 PM, still there was no one. Also, there is another major glitch. We were told that upon check-in, our credit card would be charged the full balance on the spot. We accepted this. But when we checked in, the charges had already been made and using the original card. Since I intended to use my credit card for the balance (my wife paid the first night's deposit), the management had to void the subsequent charge and credit her the balance and then charge on my card. Fortunately, the desk was charming and helpful despite all this. Our taxi was waiting for us promptly to take us back to the airport. Figure under $20 including tip each way from and to the airport. We managed to see quite a bit of the immediate area by taking local transport. Yes, I recommend Balboa Park Inn. There is so much charm and the location is superb.

It was also very private, very quiet, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Who could want more?! We found it a delightful change from the bland cookie cutter rooms found in your standard hotel chain. The location is perfect; it's tucked into a quiet residental neighborhood with very lttle traffic (we slept with the windows open and didn't hear a sound) that's a short walk to the SD Zoo. It's also a great walking and jogging area. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, the continental breakfast is more than adequate, and our only complaint was that on the street parking can be tight. An earlier reviewer complained of the musty smell that we have found in many older hotels -- we always carry an aromatic candle with us. That and an open window will quickly clear the air and add a little romantic atmsophere. Restaurants are scarce in the immediate neighborhood, but the Cafe on Park is about a mile up the street . It serves an awesome breakfast with pizza sized pancakes that are locally famous. There is also a Farmers Market grocery where you can pick up fresh fruit, sandwiches, drinks and any other items you want to keep in the in-room frig. Dinner restaurants will require a trek.

I haven't found a hotel room for $99 in several years so I was expecting \"very average\". What a pleasant surprise! The hotel room reminded me of what you WISH you'd find on the Left Bank in Paris, only this one was perfect! It wasn't huge, but comfortably held a queen size canopy bed with white lace topper (very comfortable), a huge chaise lounge (to die for), some decorative pieces and a built in holding a small refrigerator with a microwave and coffee maker on top. The room was well supplied with up do date travel brochures and information on local restaurants. Great ambiance and charm. Predominate dark green, brown and white make the room cheerful and bright and extremely inviting. I appreciated the lighting, often a neglected item. This room contained a floor lamp, a wonderful reading lamp next to the chaise and two bedside wall lamps with decorative shades. The room wasn't fancy...no marble tubs... but I give it 10+ for the charm, cleanliness and comfort factors. Staff were very nice when I made the reservation, explaining the different rooms, pros and cons. When we were arrived everything was in order; I was asked if I needed a hairdryer, iron or anything and they were brought to our room immediately. Breakfast was simple but plentiful...fresh fruit, juice, cereal, assorted muffins and pastries...excellent hot tea and coffee. We simply called and it was brought to our room within five minutes. We additional had the choice of eating in the lovely courtyard, but I really didn't want to leave the room. Since I live only two hours north, I stay in San Diego several times a year for various reasons. I have always stayed downtown so that I could have a view of the water. Having stayed at the Balboa Park Inn, I'll be forgoing the water view for this cozy get away. For those who don't know San Diego well, this is an excellent location if you have access to a car. Parking is free on the street. You can walk across the street to the zoo if you're with kids...or if you're a big kid. You have easy access to the marvelous museums in Balboa Park, as well as being conveniently located to anywhere else you'd want to go in San Diego. The price for value is amazing; it's a great place for a family to stay. Warning: If you like chain, cookie cutter hotels, this is not the place for you.

Here is my take on the following: LOCATION- very good especially if you want easy access to the zoo and other downtown attractions. But note, they don\u2019t have a parking lot so be prepared to be circling around the block to look for street parking. ROOMS and VALUE - depends on the room. Pay attention on which one you get because some of the d\u00e9cor is downright tacky. And all rooms are very old. The Monet\u2019s room is decent and clean and for $149 per night is a good value. The Greystoke room is good for those that want that \u201czoo\u201d feeling but for $219 per night isn\u2018t worth it unless you love, love, love, stuffed lions! And the Greystoke room is awful, do not pick this room, it is super tacky with a mix match of repainted furniture and odd scary looking fake plants. Service - Not sure because we hardly had any interface with the front desk folks. They seem nice enough. Breakfast - It\u2019s just pastries and juice, not much to comment on.

The suite we had was very spacious, with a bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette (including fridge, microwave, coffee maker and grill) and living room area (with big sofa and small tv). All the rooms in our suite were clean and well presented, the TV in the living area was smaller than the one in the bedroom, but there was a nice fireplace with an electric fire (not really a fire as in it didn't give out heat) which crackled nicely and lit up. The Monet has a balcony from the kitchen door that is shared with another unit. Our suite was on the first floor, up a fairly steep flight of stairs, and carrying heavy cases could be difficult for less able people. Parking was on the street, and we never had a problem finding a spot close to the hotel. During our stay the hotel was not full, and it was in a residential area with a school opposite so maybe parking could be more difficult at busier times. Breakfast was delivered to the room, you just had to ring down when you wanted it and it was there a few minutes later. The choice was pastries or cereals with fruit juice and a bowl of fruit, it was an adequate start to the day. The location was excellent, an easy 10 minutes stroll to the zoo. We drove to Fashion Valley Mall at Friars Road (about 10 minutes) to catch the trolley into the city, which was a better option for us than driving into downtown. Check in was very friendly and the staff very helpful and informative. There were restaurant on 'University Avenue\u2019 however we had our meals in downtown and at the Fashion Valley mall where there were a few restaurants (including the Cheesecake Factory, Crocodile Cafe and PF Chang) along with lots of shops.

Early Saturday morning I called and asked the folks at Balboa Park Inn if they would be kind enough to let us cancel the first 3 nights of our 4 night stay (spent the rest of the trip in Anaheim) - something they didn't have to do based on their cancellation policy. They understood and let us cancel. Although I was unhappy with the airlines, it was a little easier to swallow knowing that the Inn was flexable. We booked the Mayfair Suite - upon arriving late on Tuesday night we were extremely please with the room/suite. The place is huge! It felt like a home away from home, and we all slept like babies.... The next morning is when he had some time to really check the place out. As my son, daughter and I were exploring the welcoming courtyard - warm partries, fruit and juice were delived to our room to my wifes delight. The food was more than enough for my family of 4, and delicious! Unfortunatelly because our trip was cut short, we had to check out that morning and drive up to Anaheim for the Disney parks (after spending the day at the zoo).

Room smelled of musty odor that actually made me & my husband ill. 3. Bathroom was very outdated, especially the shower. 4. The plastic flowers gave it a tacky feeling all around. 5. Despite the claim that the place is quiet, we heard the jacuzzi motor from other rooms until 1am and we did hear the heavy footsteps of other people around. 6. Didn't see the warning sign on the door until the day we checked out that the property contains cancer causing material that can be harmful to someone who is pregnant. 7. We knew that the building was old, but we at least expected for a highly rated hotel, the owners would have remodeled to modern standards but it was in its original state just much older. 8. It was clean, but not immaculate. 9. The whole place just had a tacky feeling with cheap decor. Not a characteristic of an outstanding place to stay. 10. The breakfast was good but again, it's canned fruits and Costco pastries. We have stayed in other hotels in San Diego and I would say this is by far the worst. We stayed at the Hyatt Manchester, Double Tree, Embassy Suites and the Marriott. For the price, I think it's not worth it to stay here. We've gotten better bargains in those other hotels. We paid about $170 per night plus tax to get one of their bigger suites, but I could have paid the same for a Marriott Residence Inn and get a full breakfast and a pool. One thing I did learn is not to rely on all the glorious reviews you read on-line. Who wrote all those excellent reviews anyway?

Also, the price is incredible, I really could not believe we were staying somewhere so great for so cheap. Every other decent place in town for a suite was at least $210 a night. Even though each room in the Inn was booked, it was incredibly quiet and peaceful. It was like having our own apartment, we settled right in. Our 4 yr old loved having her own fold out bed in the livingroom, and there was enough space next to it for our toddler's pack n play (we brought it with us, but the Inn offered a crib for $10 if we had needed it). The livingroom TV had lots of channels and great reception, but there is no TV in the bedroom, so if you plan to relax in that room after putting your kids to bed in the livingroom, you'll want to bring a portable DVD (that's what we did).

Our room was very neat and clean - we stayed in the Orient Express room (which is really pretty great) - it's like being inside an old Asian brothel - very low light with red and black theme. It was disappointing that the breakfast was so average - canned fruit in the fruit salad and some run-of-the-mill, store bought pastries - for the price ($175 per night), I guess we thought there might be more effort put into breakfast. Even offering yogurt would take it up a notch. Finally, while everyone we met on the staff was very friendly, we were extremely disappointed to find that when we asked for local directions at the front desk, neither woman working there could help us. One said \"Oh, I don't live around here\" and the other just said \"I have no idea\". It seems to me that part of offering excellent service should include a staff that is at least familiar with the surrounding area...so, all in all, we thought it was just O.K.

We stayed in the MayFair Suite which is the largest suite they have. It was like staying in an apartment. Two good sized bedrooms, a living room, bathroom and full kitchen. This room is nicely decorated with charm and the bathroom had been remodeled and updated. Lots of nice touches throughout that made it comfortable and cozy. There were two AC units, one in kitchen and one in living room so the whole place stayed a nice temperature. There was a t.v. in the living room and one in one of the bedrooms. Breakfast was served every day to our room and consisted of assorted hot pastries, juice and a big bowl of fruit. After reading some of the complaints about the food we were not sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised. It was absolutely plenty of food for the four of us. The fruit bowls probably had about 2 cups of fruit in them and their were always at least three different kinds of assorted pastries warm and yummy in our basket. Plenty for us all to get our fill. It was always enough food to get us started and they offer to serve it to you either in your room or out on the patio. We were so exhausted after our trips to Sea World and the zoo that we ordered in two of the three nights we stayed there. The lady at the front desk recommended some places and she was right on the money. The first dinner was from China Wok which was very tasty. The second was from Florencia's which I can't recommend enough and was so much food we had half of it the next night. Delivery was fast and friendly so definitely ask what the staff recommends for dining out or in as the suggestions will most likely make you happy. The inn is literally a 5 minute walk to the zoo and it is a nice walk past a park and school. We stayed during the week and heard no school noise and very little traffic noise even though one side of the Inn is on a busy street. The AC units prob blocked a lot of that out so I'm not sure what it would sound like if you weren't running them. We would definitely stay here again and prob this same room as other rooms get mixed reviews.

I booked the Oriental Express room for a romantic, get-away surprise for my fianc\u00e9\u2019s birthday in July. We spent the first half of the day at the SD Zoo, which is literally walking distance from the Inn! That was great as you're also close to lovely Balboa Park and only 12 minutes from the Harbor (where we went on a harbor dinner cruise- my advice is those aren't worth the $, so don\u2019t bother). Our room was clean. The couch, comforter, bed linens, towels, and things just felt old and dusty. The room was much smaller than expected which came as quite a surprise. The themed decoration was neat though and helped make up for what it lacked in size. The smoke-tinted mirror over the bed was fun but took some getting used to. The bathroom was ok with an older tile lshower, standard single sink, and a tub. They did leave a lovely candelabrum near the tub, filled with new taper candles and a book of matches. That was a nice touch. The toilet was in a separate room, which was all black, which also took some getting used to (even a black toilet!). At night I discovered the light in the toilet room didn't work, which was a pain but nothing we could fix and the scary Chinese mask on the wall looked scarier in the dark. After having enough to drink you\u2019d swear it was moving. Our stay was quiet and we heard no other guests. This is definitely a place for couples only. We had a great time overall, but wouldn\u2019t come back to the same place. It was fun for what it was, but nothing I\u2019d want to do again. I think the best thing was the amazing omelet breakfast we had at \u201cCaf\u00e9 on Park\u201d down the street, as recommended by the hotel front desk. The intimate gay art on the walls was a bit much to digest while eating, but the food was killer! This place is a great value and the location is prime.

We chose it because of the great reviews that it had here on Trip Advisor and felt that it lived up to just about everything that we read. The Inn is really easy to find, as it is literally right across the street from the Zoo and Balboa Park, so you can pretty much follow signs from just about anywhere and get there with no trouble. It only took us about 15 mintues from the airport in our rental car. It is also close to downtown. We didn't really venture around the nearby neighborhoods, but on the way there, we saw lots of nice restaurants and coffee shops, so I'm sure there are lots of them around. Check in was easy and despite what some of the reviews here say, we did have help from the staff lugging our bags up to the room. We stayed in the Monet Suite and it was very nice and much bigger than we had anticipated. It was literally like having your own apartment. There was a nice livingroom with a comfy couch, two chairs, a table, tv with dvd player and a nice fake fireplace. It felt very homy and comfortable. The bathroom had fairly new fixtures and was very clean, however the plumbing was really noisy sometimes...but, not enough to be a nuisance. The bedroom was plenty big and had a really comfy bed, dresser w/mirror, a tv, two nightstands with lamps and a closet that fit our big suitcase on a stand. The kitchen was bigger than we imaged as well. it had a table with two chairs, utensils, glasses and plates, a microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker and large refrigerator. They supply plenty of coffee (regular and decaf), sugar, creamer and hot chocolate. We also had a deck that we shared with another unit, that was nice to eat breakfast on in the morning. Others mentioned the plastic flowers outside and some said that they found them tacky and silly, but to be honest....they mix these flowers with real ones, plus there are lots of trees and such on the decks and patios as well. I didn't really even notice them, to be honest. I don't think I would have even realized that they were plastic, had I not read it on Trip Advisor ahead of time. The breakfasts were nothing special, but they were enough to tide us over for a little while. You got fresh fruit and juice and a choice of cereal or pastries. Like others have said, the rooms are exceptionally clean. We asked directions and suggestions from Robbi at the front desk and she was very, very helpful and friendly. Our room was fairly quiet, the rooms aren't soundproofed well, but we didn't find it to be a problem at all. The only suggestion that I would have for the folks at the Balboa Park Inn would be to put irons and ironing boards in the rooms. It would make things much easier on the guests!! :-) I know that other guests mentioned a cleaning smell of some kind, but I didn't really notice it and I have allergies and asthma, so it must not be all that bad. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. It is clean, fun and much more room than you'd get at a chain hotel for twice as much money. If you're looking for cookie cutter, boring hotel room then I would avoid the Balboa Park Inn, but if you're looking for a clean, friendly, cozy place with character.....definitely stay here!!", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, pleasant accomodations\u201d", "Author": "maria12134", "ReviewID": "UR5609447", "Content": "I chose balboa park inn based on it's number # 1 rating for San Diego.

If you go stay here expecting the full American B&B treatment, then you will be disappointed. We paid $99 dollars a night for the Aruba room for two nights, and for San Diego that's cheap even by motel standards. Considering what we paid, we thought this place was fantastic! Location wise, this place is just a few minutes stroll from the entrance to San Diego Zoo (best zoo in the world in my opinion), and a short drive from Hillcrest and other sites...it's also close enough to the freeway to get to Seaworld easily. The room itself was small but came with a huge bathroom with a great jetted tub, and an outside table to enjoy the motel's enclosed and secluded courtyard. Breakfast was simple, but served to our door each morning at the time we specified. We thought the 'aquatic' theme in the room (cuddly toy fishes dangling on strings from the ceiling!?), and the colourful courtyard were both really fun! And most importantly, everything was totally clean. Okay, so some of the flowers in the courtyard are plastic, and the room themes are a little over the top...but we thought this just added to the fun of the place...it doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes for a great place to just relax. The owners have obviously gone to a lot of effort...it's just that it might not be to everyone's taste. I'd definitely recommend this as a great place to stay, provided that over-the-top room themes make you laugh rather than cringe.

Balboa Park ended up being a big highlight to our trip to San Diego, and it was great being beside it. We stayed in City Lights, which is a bargain for $99/night. Housekeeping lugged our heavy suitcases up the stairs to our room- those girls are strong! We really liked the room - it was very clean and spacious. The amenities are nice - with tea, hot chocolate, and coffee and all the fixings in the room. There was a microwave and mini fridge in the room, which was great for heating up leftovers, which saved us money. The breakfast is nice. They brought it within 10 minutes of calling every morning. Great service. We did have some plumbing problems in our bathroom. The toilet was having tons of problems, and we ended up getting upgraded free of charge to The Courtyard Suite for the last night of our stay. This suite was so incredibly eclectic! It was crazy with tons of mix-matched pieces of decor, but we liked it. The huge jacuzzi tub was awesome. I don't think I'd pay $169/night for the room though. The smaller City Lights room was just fine. I have to say the beds in both rooms were the best! I liked them just as much as Westin's heavenly beds, which says a lot. If you need to have internet access, good luck. We were able to tap into a free, public wireless connection when we were in the City Lights room but not in the Courtyard Suite. The person at the front desk couldn't help us. My husband ended up sitting on the step outside the building where City Lights is and accessing wireless that way.

When our other hotel couldn't accommodate the last day of our stay, I chose this hotel because of it's #1 ranking on the Trip Advisor website, but I was somewhat disappointed with it overall. (We probably had been spoiled by having such a nice suite at the Glorietta Bay Hotel in Coronado - for not much more than the $189/night that we paid for this room). While the staff was nice enough at check in, I thought it was kind of strange that if you wanted to have a hair dryer, iron or ironing board, they 'lent' them to you upon check-in and asked that you take them to your room (were they afraid you might steal them, or could they not afford to provide one in each room? What's next the coffeemaker?) Overall the buildings and our room in particular left a lot to be desired. This hotel is made up of several older homes. The bougainvillea climbing flowers were beautiful in the courtyards, but our room was on the second floor in a building down the street. We were all tired after a long day of sightseeing and weren't impressed when we unexpectedly had to lug all of our suitcases up the carpeted steps by ourselves. The room was awkwardly laid out with a bedroom in what would have been a dining room and a sofa bed in the kitchen. While everything seemed to be clean, the room was hot and muggy. Fortunately, there was a security screen door off the public bedroom (i.e., dining room) that we could lock, but leave open to help the place cool off while we were at dinner. Note, there are no restaurants nearby this hotel, so you must drive to another area to get something to eat. The beds and bathroom were fine, but not as nice as we had hoped for from a #1 ranked hotel. In the morning, I got a little frustrated because we couldn't use the coffee maker and the microwave oven (I like hot milk with my coffee) at the same time without tripping the circuit breaker. We had no problem calling down for breakfast and it was nice that they delivered it to our room. Breakfast was ample and delicious (we opted for fruit cup and pastries), but we thought that since our \"family sized\" room rented for four people and we had 3 adults and a child, they should have given us 4 breakfasts, not just three (it's not like they gave us a discount because we had a child and only 3 adults). We ate outside on the large upstairs deck and enjoyed the beautiful San Diego weather. While there were plenty of chairs, the deck was a bit run down and could use some attention. And, seeing the rats nest of electrical wires that were overhead and going into the buildings, I could understand why the breakers kept tripping. Upon check-out, after multiple trips up and down the stairs to get all our suitcases back to our rental and returning the hair dryer to the front desk, the desk clerk said he wasn't surprised by our microwave/coffee pot electrical problem, stating that these old homes were built in the 1930's and all had a lot of wiring issues.", "Date": "June 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cOverrated\u201d", "Author": "Alva One", "ReviewID": "UR5363299", "Content": "We chose the Balboa Park Inn based on Tripadvisor and spent three nights recently.
