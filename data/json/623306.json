{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great small hotel This is a very nice small hotel. It only has about 20 rooms spread over 9 floors. The staff was extremely helpful, although they spoke limited English. They arranged taxis and made restaurant reservations. The rooms are equiped with stove, toaster oven, microwave oven, fridge, coffee maker, ironing board and iron, and DVD player. The hotel faces a major highway, but is very well insulated, so we had no problems with noise. The location is central to many things, but not the closest hotel to anything except Chapultepec Park. It is within walking distance of fine restaurants in the Polenco district and within two blocks of the Chapultepec Metro station. If you plan to see a wide range of areas within Mexico City, it is a very good location. If you are mainly interested in the historical center and the Zone Rosa, then it might be a little out of the way. One word of caution on the address. Knowing the address will not help you or a taxi driver find the hotel. Print out the map from the hotel's web site. The map sent us a by Hotel.com had the location wrong by over 2 km. Our taxi driver took us to a place that was a couple of kilometers in the other direction. It was only because I had the map from the hotel that we were able to find it. Also having the hotel's phone number handy would be a good idea.Generally the best way to locate places in Mexico City is by cross streets, not addresses. The location of the hotel is Melchor Ocampo y Rio Rodano. It is also near the Torre Mayor, the tallest building around. As a last ditch measure, that would get you withing two blocks.", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR906968302", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Canute_the_Great"}, {"Content": "Cant wait to go Back to Suites Contempo Booked Suites Contempo on Expedia.

My wife, 11 year old daughter and I stayed in one of the Master Suites, which has a full size bed in the bedroom and a king size bed in the outer room which is also the living room/dining room. The beds were super-firm and the rooms were quiet and pleasantly furnished. The neighborhood is mostly a downtown business area that is fairly quiet at night, which suited us fine. We felt we got a lot for our money here. Breakfast wasn\u9225\u6a9b much\u9225\u650an-room coffee/tea plus milk, sweet cereal and yogurt. But the bathroom is great, with a \u9225\u6e27ertical jacuzzi\u9225?consisting of high power jets and multiple shower heads, all adjustable. The staff are friendly and helpful and speak decent English. The hotel has a van for service to the airport and it is also available for local trips.
