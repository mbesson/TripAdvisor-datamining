Some of my associates stayed closer to the Gaslamp and ended up spending almost three times as much as me with parking and tipping and everything else. I'll take the Days Inn next year when I come back. They even said when I come back I can call directly and they will give me a special rate for my return visit.

The room was a great value for what we paid. The staff was extremely; as they always willing to go the extra distance for what we needed including unpgrading us to a business class room when they made a mistake and booked two different groups for our original room. The location was great with restaurants such as Hunter Steakhouse and Denny's nearby plus a little quaint cafe on the hotel premises. The location was central with Qualcomm Stadium (home of the Chargers), Mission Bay + Sea World no more than five miles away & shopping centers such as Fashion Valley directly down the street.
