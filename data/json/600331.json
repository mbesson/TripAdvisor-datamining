The room is same with some wood finishes. It is still welcoming when you get to room and then.....transparent bathroom right there to the side. It takes getting used to. On our second stay, my son had to leave room whenever my daughter and I had to use bathroom. Linens and towels are clean and fresh. Room and bathroom very clean. The third bed is a pulldown from the wall, not exactly a Murphy bed, more like a cruise ship pulldown, but it works. It is narrow so, that may be a factor when booking this. Breakfast variety is ok but overpriced. My daughter favored a bakeshop on the main ave. The reception staff is professional but indifferent. Spoke English well.

Initially, we were given a small room with a double bed and extra bed in it, which did not leave us any room to move around (the person in the last bed would have to climb over the double bed to get out). We complained at the desk and the staff immediately put us in a family room (301), which had a double bed and 2 bunk beds. It was slightly bigger, but had more room to move around in. The bathroom lacked any privacy, as the wall separating it from the bedroom was of stained glass and the door could not be shut entirely. Not very nice when you're on the toilet and your friends are on the other side of the partition.... The shower was fancy, but as there was no door to close it with, the water sprayed everywhere, soaking the bathroom and the edge of the bedroom as well. The beds were the most disappointing of all, very hard matrasses, which hurt our backs. I did not get a good night's sleep at all, neither did my friends. The TV only had Spanish and German (!) channels, so we did not use it, nor did we have breakfast in the hotel, as we thought it too expensive. We went out for breakfast instead.

And, surprisingly to us, the bathroom door was just a glass door that swung both ways! So no privacy. Breakfast was so-so, and was an extra charge. We had a room in the back of the hotel, with no view (except of other windows, where across the way other guests kept leaving their curtains open and clothes off...). It seems there are cute front rooms with little Juliet balconies, that might be nicer. The location is great, however - we were right at a Metro stop (Gran Via) and walking distance to Plaza del Sol, and a bit further to Plaza Santa Ana. That was a big plus as we tried to find our way around the city - and for returning midday for siesta. Plus wifi was included, which I appreciated as well. Housekeeping stopped by and were up to par as well. NOTE: If you are sensitive to scents, you will have problems in this hotel. I'm not, but I did notice that there are air deodorizers EVERYWHERE in the building, and it seems as if they even scent the air coming out of the air ducts!

Next day, I had apparaently left it too late to request a room move and so they could not do anything. I refused to pay for that horrible room again. I demanded a move to another hotel at the same rate but they refused to help. In tact, the receptionist, Pedro, was rude and very unhelpful and was muttering and smirking throughout my entire discussion with him.

The room was all right, not very big, but nice bathroom, LCD TV on the wall, etc. But we have found a few problems as well. One of the blankets was dirty, and we'd realized that more of the spots in the ceiling were hanging down. They seemed to be ready to fall down at any moment. One of them obstructed he opening of the bathroom door. I went down complaining to the reception. The receptionist promised me to call the technical support next day, and changed the dirty blanket. In spite of this promise, nobody fixed it during our stay...We've had other technical problem too. The lock of our room went wrong, and we were not able to close it. This problem was solved by the time we got back in the evening. We've had good experiences too. For example the breakfast was great. Wide range of cold and warm drinks and foods every morning. The biggest advantage of the hotel is the location. I don't say that it would be a bad hotel, but not as good as expected.", "Date": "March 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Daniel1010", "ReviewID": "UR13944511", "Content": "Very modern hotel set in a great location, close to all shops.

It is also equidistant from the Royal Palace and the Prado Museum which are located on the opposite ends of GranVia. On the inside, the hotel is nice, clean, with a fresh and resolutely modern outlook. The bathroom is spotlessly clean and features a massage shower.

Although, I still believe I received a good deal for a decent hotel considering booking at the last minute. In any case, I was very happy with my stay at the Petit Palace Tres Cruces. I took the metro and got off at the Gran Via stop, and from there it was only barely a 5 minute walk to the hotel (which wasn't bad at all considering I had to haul my luggage with me.) The hotel is located right off the main Gran Via street area, and only a 1 to 2 minute walk down Tres Cruces. I didn't have any trouble checking in and the lobby of hotel was very nicely decorated considering it was slightly small. The internet was available free of charge on a couple of computer stations set up directly opposite the front desk. The hallway leading up to my room from the elevator was slightly dark, but then again how much time will a person really spend in the hallway...? The hotel seemingly had an overall theme of saving energy where they can, so I believe this was the reason for the dim lighting in certain areas. My room was a single room with a window facing the inside of the hotel (other hotel room windows), but I didn't really mind that. The room was clean, had a decent full/queen size bed, a plasma screen TV mounted on the wall, a safe in the closet (that operates with your credit card for security purposes, but is free of charge), and a decent sized closet for one person. The bathroom was modern and WAS AWESOME! It had a spacious stand-up shower with various jets for massaging, as well as a rain-shower head with different pressures you could adjust it to, and finally a removable shower head that had a couple different pressure settings as well. The bathroom was spacious and very clean with an ample amount of fluffy towels for one person. Also, the bathroom had a sink that was a vessel (bowl-shaped) that I thought was pretty cool. If you are the type of person that likes to spend a lot of time in your hotel room the only thing I would consider slightly bothersome is the lack of English-speaking TV channels (I had CNN on anytime I had the TV on as it was the only English channel I could find.) Also, the bed took up most of the space in the room so I wouldn't call it spacious, but it was definitely enough room for one person. The room could even be enough room for 2 people if you're not in the room most of the time other than to shower and sleep. Oh and one tip I have is that the lights in the room operate by inserting your room key card into the slot on the wall upon entering through the room's door (took me a couple minutes to figure that out since it was the first time I ever saw something like that.) The hotel staff I came across was friendly and willing to help. During my stay of 4 days and 3 nights I interacted with 4-5 members of the hotel staff and all of them were very helpful. As a matter of fact when I just generally asked where I could get any tour information, a man working at the front desk not only gave me a few pamphlets and maps, but also told me which some of the better tours were. I then found out I could also book and pay for the tours at the front desk, which I did for 3 out of my 4 tours. This was a great option and convenience that was readily available in my opinion. This hotel is within walking distance of the main areas of Puerta Del Sol and Plaza Mayor and from those areas everything else is in decent walking distance. If you're up for it, it's a bit longer of a walk to the famous art museums (Prado, Reina Sofia, Thyssen-Bournemiza) from this hotel. Although, I must admit that I'm a slow walker and still was able to get to the Prado on a slightly rainy day in about 40 minutes, if that helps give you an idea of how far it is. Oh and another tip I have is that the Prado - which is usually the busiest out of the art museums - is free on Sundays and I believe Fridays also. Although, I'm only sure of Sundays being a free day at the Prado as that's the day I went...another tourist in passing mentioned Fridays being free to me. All in all, this hotel is in a great location at a decent price (helps if you don't book at the last minute like I did), the staff was friendly and helpful, and finally the hotel room and bathroom more than met my standards of what a decent hotel room should look like. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I was in Madrid and found a good deal for it.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "teachertraveler_Ohio", "ReviewID": "UR8035483", "Content": "The location of this hotel is SUPERB for exploring Madrid\u2019s Historic District!
