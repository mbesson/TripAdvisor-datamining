Hotel is conveniently located to everything, price is under $20 for a double bed, private baths are nice and there is a phone and cable tv. The hotel is very safe and the best bargain in Mexico City!

The location is perfect - on a quiet side street in very close proximity to the Centro Historico and Zocalo. It is also close to two metro stops, good restaurants and conveniences. We paid 200 pesos a night (about $15 US). For the price, it can't be beat. The hotel is an older historic building on a side street. It has an small fountain in a little courtyard. The rooms were basic but clean. Our first room was an outside unit with a floor to ceiling door/window which was charming and allowed for great views and ventilation. Our second room was an interior room with no window but room enough for two people, especially given that we spent little time in the room. The front desk staff were friendly and, with the exception of one person, very accommodating. Here's the problem which is no fault of the hotel. Across the alley from the hotel is a private residence which proceeded to blast techno music at nightclub levels from 4am until 8am. I am not exaggerating when I say the music in the room coming from this residence was louder than I would play it in my own house or car. We wore earplugs and the music was still so loud it sounded like it was coming from our room. We went to the front desk and were informed that this has been going on for about 3 months. The hotel has called the police and written to various government agencies about the problem and nothing has been done about it. We asked to move to an interior room to escape the noise and were moved. Two nights later, from the other side of the hotel, we could still hear the music as clearly as if it was in the room next door. Overall, the hotel is a clean and basic place to stay, close to everything and very reasonable in price and I would recommend it. However, if the hotel doesn't find a solution to its neighbors, I wouldn't recommend it, which is unfortunate since the hotel has no control over this.", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio Grande Valley, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBasic Comforts But Good For The Price\u201d", "Author": "texano1957", "ReviewID": "UR19942767", "Content": "I had to travel to Mexico City in late January and a friend made the reservation for me. it is simple, safe, somewhat comfortable and right there in the Historic district. The room was OK, it did have a small window. All rooms surround a dark courtyard with an ancient fountain. it was a unique experience. There were people from all over the world staying there. The staff were friendly and helpful but did not speak much English. There is a vending machine in the reception area with sodas, beer, snacks and.......condoms! However it is a not a sleazy place at all and seemed as family friendly as a low budget hotel in Mexico City's Historic district could be. I paid $27 per night. There is NO internet available here, no irons or coffee-makers in the rooms! There, there was a few good eating places nearby and a couple of bars, some with interesting Victorian era woodwork!", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Juarez", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d646013-Reviews-Hotel_Juarez-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1A Cjon De Cinco de Mayo No. 17</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col.
