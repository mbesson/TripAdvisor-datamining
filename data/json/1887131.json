The location is the biggest selling point, just back from the designer shops of the rue Saint Honore and 5 minutes walk from the Madeline square and Concorde. We were very well looked after by the hotel staff, who were all very friendly and accommodating, with the receptionist happy to recommend restaurants and directions. The rooms themselves were nicely finished and from the top floor we had a balcony with a view out across to the Eifel Tower which was amazing, especially at night. The whole place also felt clean and well looked after. Another big plus was the breakfast delivered to the room on Sunday morning with a wide selection of pastries, coffee and juice. Some negatives to note about the rooms - a little on the small side (although given the location this is probably to be expected) and the bathroom could be improved (the glass door doesn't offer much privacy (and is potentially lethal in the middle of the night if you forget it's closed) despite the curtain which can be drawn across and water runs across the floor when in the shower). These points were slightly disappointing but by no means major points. Would certainly recommend a stay here if visiting Paris and we would happily stay again.

The shower floods the bathroom, the toilet is situated under a sloping roof so no easy task when you are tall. The service in the hotel let my stay down. The checkin staff were not great and they did not propose an iPad when I checked in as is supposed to be the case. The housekeeping was not good - Turn down service was forgotten on the last night, cutlery from breakfast that I had in my room on the first morning was never removed etc. these are all several points that make what could be a very good hotel only quite average. On one night in the early hours of the morning the fire alarm went off. When I arrived in the lobby the duty manager was in a flutter and had no idea how to cope with the situation - it turned out that a client had been smoking in her bedroom. There were no apologies either at the time or during the remainder of my stay and I find this sad. It is a small hotel and it is not difficult to apologise to the clients but evidently this is not something the hotel management cares about. The receptionist at checkout was the only decent member of staff that I came across. She apologised but unfortunately thos was too little too late On a positive note the hotel is well placed and has a good cosy atmosphere to it. It is a shame the staff miss that point.

We had booked the hotel through Small Luxury Hotels of the World. The checkin went fine, quick and efficient, as they were expecting us and the staff was very pleasant and helpful too. We had booked a Superior room and were upgraded to a Deluxe. A very pleasnat surprise after a long flight! We ended up having a room on the first and second floors. As other reviewers mentioned the rooms were a bit small but very manageable, however very nicely and elegantly furnished. The size didn't bother us as we weren't expecting to spend all of our time in our room anyways. One doesn't visit Paris to sit in your hotel room! If you are only one person in the room, the size should not be an issue. Even with 2 people in the room with LARGE size suitcases there was no issue. Both rooms were on the corner facing the street, so you got a good view of the outside. There are some restaurants and pubs out on the street, however the rooms seem to be well insulated from the noise outside and that was not a problem. The only problem that we encountered was with the room on the first floor. The sink in the bathroom would seem to back up in the middle of the night and one night overflowed onto the floor. We mentioned this to the staff in the morning and they were very responsive to this problem and got a plumber to look into the problem immediately that day. This happened 2 nights in a row and each time the staff responded by getting someone in to look at it during the day while we were out. The problem was resolved after the second time. If it were not for this issue, I would gladly rate this hotel with 5 stars! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants and places to go and how to get there. The breakfast in the morning consisted of cheeses, meats, danish, pastries and croissants, fruits, yogurt, coffee or tea, juices, and cereals. In our opinion this wasplenty and was filling for a breakfast, although we usually don't eat a big breakfast. The WiFi connection worked fine from either room or the lobby. We had our own iPads and did not use the iPads offered by the hotel. As far as the location, it was excellent. The Palais Elysee is located a block away. The Palais Elysee is the home to the President of France and thus the security in the area around the Palais is great. The neighborhood is very safe. You are close to the Rue Faubourg high end shopping district a few blocks away. About 3 blocks away is the Champs Elysee and great strolling. The Seine is another couple blocks from the Champs Elysee, maybe 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Metro stops are also within walking distance. Finally, we would definitely stay here again.

[Mar 2011, 6 nights] The 1st time was excellent except the housekeeping entered to the room even the Stop signage was hanging outside the door. The day & night shifts staffs were helpful. The Superior Room I stayed was clean. [Sep 2011, 3 nights] The 2nd time was poor, the check-in was terrible. As a Club member of SLH, I was entitled to have room upgrade subject to availability, so I asked the night shift staff if I could have any room upgrade for this stay, the staff answered \"I don't know what you talk about!\", then I explained a bit more about the Club's benefits to him, he kept on answering \"What do you what?! I don't know what you want\", after further explained to him, he then replied they were fully booked and no upgrade was available, which was fine, it was not a guarantee upgrade, but I wondered how could he didn't know what were the Club's benefits. As per my 1st stay, I knew there were no toothbrush, toothpaste and sleepers provided in the room, so I asked for these during the check-in. As I knew this small hotel only had one staff to manage the whole hotel at night, so I didn't want to waste time on waiting for things as the check-in was at 11pm already. The same staff asked me to go upstairs to check if they were available, if no, then called him and he would bring them. Then, I explained it was my 2nd stay, I knew these were not provided and I didn't want to waste time as it was late, he replied he was not housekeeping, he didn't know what would be provided in the room and he didn't know where were they were stored in the hotel, then he questioned me why did I need two sets of things if they were provided in the room. Then, he started to look for those things until I promised I would give him back the things if they were already provided in the room. The staff really didn't know where to get the stuffs, he then took a dental set out from his personal bag. After the 30mins check-in and arguing, I went up to the room, same as last time, what I requested were not provided in the room, so I spent another hour to wait for the only staff to bring me the sleepers, breakfast form and wifi logins & passwords. I could not login the hotel wifi until I got the 4th set of logins. Regarding the breakfast form, he could not find it, so I wrote him what I wanted for the in-room breakfast. The staff kept on telling me he worked at different and many hotels, he said if you wanted to complain, he would tell his version, I could tell my version, it would not hurt his reputation or losing a job. I paid for 300 euro a night, but I felt like I was staying at 130 euro hotel. Since I didn't what my mood to be ruined for the rest of my stay, I chose not to complain about the check-in. As per my booking confirmation and as a Beloved member of SLH, the rate offers listed I entitled to have late check-out at 4pm, it didn't mention subject to availability, so I told a day shift staff that I would like to check out at 4pm, then the staff replied as the hotel was fully booked, what they could do was to give me a late check-out at 2pm, he asked me to call SLH to check about this. So, I talked to the supervisor of the hotel, at first I told him I had a terrible check-in, I was surprised that he answered he heard about it before and agreed it was a complete disaster. (If he knew about it before, I would expect someone would apologize on the next day after the check-in, but they chose to ignore it instead) Then, I asked if the supervisor could arrange me a late check-out at 4pm by showing him my confirmation which didn't mention \"subject to availability\", he showed the information from SLH that did mention \"subject to availability\", so concerning the miscommunication given by SLH and the poor check-in experience I had, the supervisor accommodated my late check-out at 4pm at the end. Thanks, Supervisor. Apart from the services, the Deluxe Room was clean, but there was bad smell coming out from the drainpipe of the shower. It was caused by the design of the shower as there was not such smell when I stay at the Superior Room with bathtub. After my 2nd stay, I would not trust the SLH Club benefits anymore as hotels would not follow.

The air con worked great. Breakfast was adequate. The area the hotel is situated in was great, as the hotel was surronded by official buildings, there were guards and police everywhere (but not in your face). We felt very safe to walk around at night. It was about a 5-10 min walk to champs elysees, the nearest metro stop is champs elysees clemenceau with again is about a 5-10 min walk. I really liked staying here (for a short break), we had been to paris once before and our previous hotel doesn't even come close to this one. If you are looking for a basic but clean hotel this is perfect. If you have to arrange transport you can get the Rossybus from Charles de gaulle airport to the Opera where you have to change metro lines twice to get to CE Clemenceau or you can get the airport bus from Charles De Gaulle to the Arc de triomph and then get the no1 line down 3 or 4 stops to clemenceau. A taxi from the hotel to this airport was 50 euros. Had we not been leaving at 8am (rush hour) I would have got the metro to the opera and then the bus to the airport for about 9 euros each. The bus leaves every 15mins.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat find\u201d", "Author": "Platz", "ReviewID": "UR16997731", "Content": "Great location, very helpful staff even those speaking broken English.

Dainty and charming are the words to describe it. The elevator accommodates exactly two people at a time, and they'd better be on intimate terms with each other going in. It's at 12 Rue des Saussaies, right across from the Deuxieme Bureau's old front door of 11 Rue des Saussaies in the Ministry of the Interior complex of buildings. (11 Rue des Saussaies was also Gestapo headquarters in 1940-44.) Just beyond the hotel's front door is Bugsy's, an 'American' style bar and bistro that is run by an Irishman named Dermot, and about as American as RyanAir. But it's a great gathering place for the Anglophone locals in Paris, mostly young Brit banker types. When I first went to this hotel you could get the tiny room at the top for a mere 550 Francs (about $85). Thanks to the decline of the dollar and a rise in prices generally, that tiny room (cinquante-trois, if you must know) now costs me about $120. For this reason I now use a cheaper, two-star, hotel up north of the Gare St-Lazare, where I can stay two or three nights for that much dosh. The only ugly thing about my experiences at the hotel was a series of encounters with a subcontinental night manager named Anwar, who gave excellent massages and was forever trying to seduce me.
