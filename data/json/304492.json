Stay there if possible. The Club Lounge has wonderful, hospitable staff and very good food. It is a lovely place to hang out and recover after a day out sightseeing in Dubai. The rooms at this level are certainly in the five-star category and our two-night stay was very enjoyable. Not-So-Good Things: At check-in, we dealt with a very unfriendly person who was adamant about an extra charge (120 dirhams, or about $35 plus 16% taxes) for a rollaway bed for the 11-year old traveling with us. Our reservations were explicitly for four adults and one child and I had assumed that our full prepayment included all members of our party. We asked to speak to the manager and he assured us that this was \"standard policy\" for all hotels in the region and he wouldn't budge on the extra charge. In fact, our party of five stayed at a total of eight hotels in the region during a 3-1/2 week tour and the Sheraton Deira was the ONLY hotel that charged us extra for a rollaway bed. It was more the hostile attitude of the front desk, rather than the extra money, that upset us. My daughter, traveling with us, is the General Manager of a high-end hotel on the beach in California. She has always told me that the way you are treated by the front desk staff at check-in will remain as your lasting impression of a hotel. This experience certainly proved her right. Please note, also, that while the hotel description says that it is \"centrally located\", in fact it is not within walking distance of any Dubai attraction and you need a cab to get to the Creek, any shopping area, or basically anywhere else you might want to go in Dubai.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran", "Title": "\u201cValuable Stay\u201d", "Author": "Saviz M", "ReviewID": "UR123723111", "Content": "Pros: kind and helpful employees, almost clean rooms, valuable price, near the subway (metro) station good breakfast quality, excellent room service, excellent guest service, closing to airport.

Situated in close proximity to the Jumerah towers, Sheraton Deira offers great shopping avenues. Sprawling lawns and meandering pools make the stay truly pleasurable. 2) A great place for socializing Club Lounge at Sheraton Deira offers some of the best recipes and delicacies from all over the world. I thoroughly enjoyed the great ambience at roof top restaurant and bar. There is wide array and economy of rooms to choose from. 3) I stayed in business class room, with a grand hall, 24 hrs internet access and room amenities. All rooms are well equipped with accessories and great interiors. Grand and well furnished conference rooms and halls offers a great meeting place. 4) Resort provides holiday packages, and sight seeing opportunities.but the cost is very very high. I visited the sand \u2013 dunes and enjoy the desert safari in Middle East through my tour operator I was mesmerized by their hospitality and organization skills. 5) One thing that I will never forget about the trip was the courtesy of their well \u2013 groomed staff. Sheikhs serving coffee..haha..you will feel the same as waiters look like mini sheikhs..:P 6) Being in Dubai how can somebody miss upon the shop carnival. I availed of some of the best marketing offers for some of the best brands at most affordable price. Standing tall amidst scintillating sky scarpers it offers a great view of the city from roof top. 7) I booked a 4 day/ 3 night tour package from Antilog Vacations (India) , a Dubai bulk dealer for hotel & sightseeing packages.The rates you get are 20-25% less than market & direct services 8) On the last day of my trip, I sailed across the blue waters of Gulf aboard a star cruise \u2013 liner. Great spectacle of the marine life and rich flora and fauna enthralled me craving for more. 9) Do some shopping, if you are rich.Resort has small antique shoppe which offers some of the great masterpiece and relics. I still relish the memorabilia that I gathered. 10) All in all resort Sheraton Deira Dubai brings alive the Arabian Nights and old folklores. It was a great vacation that I will never forget.

Good hotel to use as a base for sightseeing, nearest metro station (Abu Baker Al Siddique) is a short walk away and gets you to most of the main attractions.

From the pool at the top to the reception area we have found it clean tidy and any minor niggles fixed ASAP by the attentive staff. Take a club room and get the advantage of the Club Lounge for breakfast and evening with drinks and nibbles. The pool while not Olympic size is great due to the Staff (Jude and Jimbo) who look after in an attentive manner. Based in the old town are a short walk takes you to local shops and restaurants serving local, Indian and Chinese food at very cheap prices. Across the road from the hotel is a fantastic Indian veg restaurant which serves food to die for, try the masala dosa. Don't worry about not being down at Jumiera as taxis are cheap and the staff will arrange one for you at the front door. I read comments about the ladies of the night, yes they do get into the bar but they get into the bars of every Dubai hotel, perhaps they are cheaper at the Sheraton.

Our friend's room was ready, so we dropped our luggage with him and went exploring. Reception, like a lot of hotels in Dubai, is a large area with lots of seating so you can wait in comfort for your friends before getting a taxi. The hotel has a roof top pool area with a swim up bar and a separate heated jacuzzi. There is also space for sun loungers. It is not a massive area but we didn't have any problems getting sun loungers. The hotel is underneath the flightpath from the airport so it can be noisy. We had all booked rooms with business club access which meant we could eat breakfast in the club and have free drinks there between 6pm and 8pm. The breakfast selection included cooked foods, fresh fruit, cereals and bakery produce. The free beers in the evening were very welcome, especially in Dubai. The business club room itself is quiet and has some PC stations which give access to the internet and local and international newspapers. We didn't eat in the hotel as were out most of the time. Our room was excellent - all the more so seeing as we had been upgraded for free! The executive suite is big enough to contain a superking sized bed, a sofa and armchair, coffee table and a desk with chair and still feel very spacious. The view wasn't great as it was looking into the hotel's central atrium. The large wardrobe also contained a safe with an internal power socket. The bathroom was also huge with a large separate shower area and a bath. Sheraton supplied their usual complimentatry toiletries. Wifi was available in the rooms at an addtional charge, which is the norm for Dubai. It was expensive and slow, which is also the norm for Dubai.

Top Tip : Get a Club Room. We grabbed a cab (very cheap, forget rip off pre booked Limos etc) and our check in was seamless(2100 local). A lovely Asian lady and the Deputy Mgr attended to us and when I asked how much and the availability of a Junior Suite it was \u00a320pn (bargain). The Dep Mgr insisted I looked at both the Club Room and the Jnr Suite, I took the Suite. It wore a no smoking sign on the door but - Ha, its the Middle East everyone smokes. The Bell Boy was happy to fetch a fresh air spray and doused the room - it helped. Starting at the top the pool is cleaned and fettled daily very thouroughly. The Head Barman (Jude) works very hard and his happy hour cocktails are worth a try. Do tip him a few Dihrams he gets very embarrased but their pay aint a lot. Yes, its an Airport hotel so aircraft in the local area are possibly to be expected but most people regard the departing or landing aircraft as quite Kool. A fully laden A-380 on departure is a sight to behold! The pool lunch menu has a good choice and the food is very fresh - try the fish and chips - fantastic, with the lightest batter. The Club Lounge supplies breakfast including eggs to order and evening nibbles and free drinks. The red wine was Australian (no complaints from my better half) and my G and T`s knocked your socks off. The girls are very smiley and attentive. We never ate in the lobby restaurant but did in the Lindbergh Bar - a good enough choice and the Fillipino bar ladies again were very smiley and chatty. There is the odd lady of the night but it adds to the atmosphere and they never bothered me. The local area is Middle Eastern and well worth an evening promenade - very safe and some of the Sari shops are quite spectacular. Every shop was family owned and different -no Blockbuster video and Clinton cards here, my wife loved it. June to Sep are the hottest months in Dubai so ratesare very favourable my only observation with the Sheraton Deira is they should provide a mini bar stock list and price list - there was neither. On check out mini bar issues are always common. We had no problems at all but its an area that requires attention.

However, as a Sheraton and as a supposed upscale hotel I would say it's a disappointment and one of the more disappointing properties in the SPG group that I've been to. The one thing I've learned is that, in Dubai, things built before 2000 feel like they were built with separate rules and expectations than those built after the millennium. Nowadays, when you think of Dubai hotels you think of the luxurious extremes that were built in the boom years that were marked by the opening of the Burj Al Arab in 2001 --and to an extent that's true: things feel like a mix of Las Vegas and Manhattan in the Gulf. Alas, this hotel was built in 1996 so it feels less like the modern Dubai and more like what constitutes an upscale hotel in the developing world. That's not to say that Dubai is the developing world, just that the rules that seemed to govern its construction, design, management and --especially-- overall \"feel\" of the property give you that impression. The room we stayed in was described to us as an upgrade, so our furniture was... well, normal furniture and the bathroom looked like it had been upgraded in the previous five years. I can't say it was particularly nice. It was what I would expect at a 3 star hotel off the freeway in the United States. For some inexplicable reason they hotel was very stingy with the towels --we had to call to get more than three towels (total) for two people and they wouldn't supply many each day. The room was never cleaned particularly well for the four nights we were there and the overall room lighting was not very good. There is a club in the building so some rooms can hear the booming base (ugh!) until late at night. We were actually somewhat lucky and a few floors removed --I can't imagine what some of the other rooms were subjected to! As other reviewers have mentioned, the internet wifi rates are stupid, and the rates to use the small business center are also silly. The food at the breakfast in the main lobby is far superior to the food in the more exclusive club lounge. The hotel's located at the edges of Deira, an older neighborhood somewhat removed from modern Dubai. It is not too far from the Airport; we used the hotel's own driver service but I now think a cab might have been just as good. When the new line of the subway is finished within the next year or so it might end up being a reasonable walk from it (as of right now it's about a 15-20 minute walk from the existing subway to the airport and major sights along Sheikh Zayed Road). The first day we elected to walk over to the Dubai Creek and touristy parts of Deira and, in the 70 degree winter weather, it was an easy 20-30 minute walk over there. It isn't the most scenic walk but it isn't dangerous or difficult in any form to get over to the Gold souq or Creek areas. Cab rides are still pretty cheap in the city so you can always rely on that (we used them a lot based on the savings we had on the room). So there you have it: a hotel that isn't a good Sheraton, but if you strip that name out of your mind and can get it for under $90 USD it is a decent enough spot in what can be a pricey city. However, if you can get a more recently constructed hotel (esp. past 2002 or so) you might be able to get more bang for your buck for only slightly more per night.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cefficient\u201d", "Author": "frankview", "ReviewID": "UR98286604", "Content": "basic hotel with dated furniture.

They informed us of all the hotel amenities and let us know where to go for fabulous shopping, handbags and beach trips. The food in the restaurant was perfect! we had choices of and Italian Buffet night and French buffet night and if that didnt tickle your fancy, you could pick from the restaurant menu. The cake pastries were out of this world! and the service from the restaurant staff was amazing! Mehraj in particular was polite and always smiling. I couldnt help but tip him every time. Sweetest guy in the world. The hotel was amazingly clean to fantastic standard and the rooms were exactly the same. Definitely worth the money! Oh! I also had a massage which was lovely but I'd never had my back cracked before!

Having been advised to book the previous evening to ensure we could go straight to our room and not have to hang about until 14:00, we were surprised to be asked to wait for a few minutes to get housekeeping to check our room - no problem . What was a minor problem was that when we did get access some 10-15 minutes later we found that the sink in the bathroom had a leak. Someone knew about it because the waste bin was thoughtfully postioned under it. Mentioned it to the receptionist and she was full of apologies and if it couldn't be fixed we would be moved. It was fixed by the time of our return to the hotel. With a formal note left in the room asking us to contact the duty manager. Who asked if everything was to our satisfaction - no issue. More tea bags required - no problem Rang down to reception and they were there within 5 minutes followed by a phone call to confirm that they had been delivered. Issue over glasses for drinks mysteriously disappearing. Same approach, same result. Nothing too much trouble for a friendly hotel staff and management. Yes the hotel is on the flight path to Dubai airport but this did not cause an issue for us and double glazing kept the noise out of the bedroom. Still the plane spotters (yes they were there, complete with laptops, binos and notebooks !!) seeemed to enjoy themselves. Swimming pool is not large but is of a sufficient size with a pool side bar. Be warned though drinks are on the expensive side and not just alcolholic drinks. I am talking of the soft drink variety. We did fall foul of interpretation. My wife was asked if she wanted the bed changed and as we only had one day left of our visit she said no. The toiletries, coffee and tea were replenished but the bed was left unmade so we had to do it ourselves. Shame on us !!

Its problem is it is in Dubai where 5 star hotels try to out do each other with palatial splendour as standard. This is a four star hotel in the wrong location with limited facilities and on the flight path to the airport on its doorstep, almost. We arrived here at the end of 12 days in Maldives and as we had to change flights in Dubai it made sense to stay a day or so to see what all the fuss is about this place. Choice of bed and breakfast was really the choice of the travel agent as our knowledge of the Gulf state was nil.

I was attending a training event the following day. First problem was finding the hotel. Our instructions were to take the 3rd turning on the left and in fact Al Muteena Street was the 4th left after Maktoum Bridge and the Clock Tower Roundabout. After finding the hotel I was very disappointed with the car parking arrangements. There is no hotel car park and the only parking is on the street behind the hotel (even if you valet park). I spoke to the manager and they cleared one of only four places by the front door of the hotel for me to park my car. I was impressed how quickly they dealt with this to my satisfaction. The hotel itself was opened over 10 years ago so is old by Dubai standards. I booked over the internet and got a good price of 600 AED net including breakfast and 'romance package' (wine and fruit in the room). Late checkout until 4pm was part of this package and the reception staff kindly agreed to extend this to 5pm at no extra charge. The room was freshly painted and had new furniture. The corridor outside the room (smoking allowed in these rooms) smelt pleasantly of fresh paint. There was masking tape on the skirting boards in the corridor so the painting work must have still been in progress. Despite having a room on the front the room was quiet thanks to the double glazing. No thanks however to the noisy woman shouting outside our bedroom door at 2 am! We had a buffet dinner in the hotel (170 AED for two net). Good for the price. Breakfast was served in the same restaurant and at all meals they offered a selection of hot and cold food. I also had lunch in the same restaurant as part of my training course and by then I was bored with the limited hot options for vegetarians. The staff in the restaurant were very attentive and also made some helpful food suggestions to make sure customers got the most of the buffet. The fountain in the restaurant was old and cracked but still contained a few koi carp. This damaged fountain should have been removed when they did the repainting/refurbishment job. We went for a walk in the area round the hotel and concluded it is not located in a neighbourhood suitable for tourists. You'd have to get in a taxi to go anywhere interesting, whether to the malls or to the older parts of the city. There are much better located hotels for tourists to stay in and still be in Deira. The hotel is near the airport so convenient for a night's stay if on a short stop-over. Location was ideal for our needs but there are no frills. I would not recommend it to tourists. However, if you get a good deal on the room rate that might make up for the need to go everywhere by taxi. To sum it up I would say this hotel has good service and friendly staff. But it is an old hotel and it is let down by the old and worn infrstructure and facilities.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stourbridge", "Title": "\u201cHigh service and friendly people in good location\u201d", "Author": "Steveglass", "ReviewID": "UR29082872", "Content": "If you prefer 'old Dubai' and need a hotel that offers exceptional comfort and very high service levels, dont forget this Hotel.

We checked in around 4 am in the morning after flying from Singapore. We decided to pay a Hotel room rather than sit in reception until 3pm when the rooms would be ready whilst checking in this scantily glad woman with thigh high boots and a micro mini and a skimpy top walked passed us at reception . It would become clearer the following night what ladies dressed like hookers were doing, wandering around the hotel late at night. We were very tired and put the do not disturb sign on the door only to find the maid vacuuming outside our door banging the nozzle of the cleaner against our door at 9am. Obviously the maid did not understand what do not disturb means. The room was adequate but the towels were threadbare and the bathrobes had holes in them. The Hotel have installed, state of the art coffee machines that just do not work after four people came to look at the coffee machine and try and fix the problem I politely asked would it be possible for me to have a kettle - The kettle worked just fine. We found the Hotel very expensive considering the location. The hotel is not really near anything in particular. They have a nightclub next door, which is part of the hotel. A coke costs \u00a33.50 and a small bottle of beer \u00a37. There is a supermarket a short walk from the Hotel that caters for everything and a coke costs 20p there. Now to the shocking part there is evidence of prostitutes everywhere in the corridors of the Hotel in the Piano Bar and especially in the Nightclub when I asked the Manager about this he said that there are buyers and sellers and he was fully aware of the fact that prostitution was evidently being conducted. I was shocked because I didn't expect this in Dubai and I didn't expect it in the Sheraton. I am not talking about one or two I am talking about a whole nightclub where I really do believe that I was the only genuine guest there, all the other women were working girls and it was quite disgusting watching mainly local men pawing these young girls. My husband and I felt totally uncomfortable at this situation and we left quite quickly. If you want to relax on the rooftop pool forget it every few minutes an aeroplane flies overhead disturbing your peace and quiet. Breakfast was good and the staff very efficient We decided to order room service we felt safer in our room. The best thing about this Hotel was the checking out.

I was not disappointed. The Sheraton Deira offers decent facilities and clean well maintained (club) rooms for the business traveller. The staff are efficient and friendly. On the renovated club floor, the bedrooms are large with flat screen TVs, well stocked mini-bars and large en-suite bathroom facilities. The club lounge offers decent finger food and complimentary alcoholic drinks during Happy Hour (6-8:00 pm) and tea, coffee, soft drinks, cakes, biscuits (cookies), nuts and crisps (chips) at other times when it is open (6:00am until 10:00 or 11:00pm).. There are also two computers in the club lounge with printer and internet access. A decent breakfast is a leisurely affair served in the club floor lounge for those staying in club rooms. The bar (Lindbergh's) on the 5th floor serves decent cold beer on tap and bar meals. The views are also good. The roof top swimming pool is a good place to unwind and relax during the day. The hotel rooms are well insulated against the overflying aircraft but not so much against the music from the night club which \"rocks\" till about 03:00am. The music was audible in my room, but not loud enough to keep me awake (although it might others). Another negative point, but beyond the control of the hotel, are the huge road works (construction) between the hotel and the airport - adding significantly to the time required to get to the airport.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cNasty\u201d", "Author": "other1", "ReviewID": "UR22806282", "Content": "Best avoided: - tacky furnishings - smelly common areas (polished rather than cleaned) - poor food - dirty toilets - dreadful, grubby business facilities - 'sharp' practices with billing", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire", "Title": "\u201cYou need a taxi\u201d", "Author": "Robjan", "ReviewID": "UR21005376", "Content": "Enjoyed our stay at this hotel even though it did seem a bit out of the way from all the main attractions Dubai has to offer.
