Some people might call it 3 stars, but it lacks certain amenities that would bring it up a star such as a restaurant, in-room safe, clock and dresser drawers, fridge in the room, good heating, for example. The rooms are small but completely sufficient and very very clean though a bit cold even though we had the heat turned up as high as possible, it never really got warm, and it wasn't very cold outside. The floors are not carpeted (which helps keep it feeling clean because carpets can get really disgusting really fast) but they were cold, more than the air - the tiles just never warmed up so you had to wear socks. The breakfast is included, which is a great savings, though it would be nice if they changed it up a bit from day to day. We were there for 8 nights and by day 4 I was wishing for at least a different type of muffin or maybe some fruit. The breakfast consists of muesli, corn flakes, glazed croissant, 2 types of sweet muffins, 3 types of bread, sliced ham, sliced cheese, jams, honey, orange & pineapple fruit drink (not real juice), hot and cold milk, coffee, tea and powdered chocolate. It was enough food to not have to eat again until the afternoon. Many people brought in their own fruit which is a good idea. Two of the three staff at the desk were very helpful and nice. The third was quite brusk and obviously annoyed when we wanted to put our stuff in and out of the safe (since there is none in the room). While it is on a side street, the streets are always so busy it felt safe walking there, and was nice to be a bit off the main street. We requested a room that faced the back, and it was very, very quiet, facing an enclosed courtyard with other apartments facing. The windows shut very nicely and kept out most sounds from outside. However we were near the elevator so we could always hear people in the hallway (especially some very rambunctious children running and running and running and jumping and running for seeming hours on end) and when they were in the bathroom in the room next door we could hear loudly all the faucets and clanking. All in all it was not bad noise, but not quiet like a tomb either.

We stayed at the Hotel California and were not disappointed. Having booked the flights and hotel through Easyjet for, frankly, a song, I was slightly concerned about the accommodation. I read some earlier, fairly negative reviews on the hotel with particular regard to noise,cleanliness, and the attitude of the front desk clerks. To address these concerns in reverse order, the guys in reception were absolutely charming and couldn't do enough for us - I simply couldn't fault them. As for the room, we had a twin which was spotlessly clean; the bathroom was sparkling and the sheets had been brutally laundered. Noise was not an issue - when the balcony doors were open, we enjoyed listening to the sounds from the street - isn't that part of the city experience? When we closed the doors - nothing. Breakfast was fine - bread, cheese, muffins, jams, juice and coffee (various from a machine), very filling, relaxed with nobody looking over your shoulder waiting to clear the table, which I experienced in a Hilton once. The best thing about Hotel California is that when you walk out of the front door you are immersed in the essence of Barcelona. The architecture imposes itself; you can walk to numerous galleries as we did and the opera house is across the way, (not continuous productions). You will see deprivation, homelessness and desperation around the hotel and nearby. You'll also see individuals, restaurants and officials, (police and security staff), in the immediate area and further afield, taking a wonderfully tolerant and compassionate approach to those marginalised people. If I have one gripe about the California, it's that there was no mirror in the bedroom. As a woman who MUST wash and then straighten her hair every day, I needed that. The bathroom steams up and defeats the object, plus there is no socket there anyway! Otherwise, what a wonderful place from which to explore the city? We walked to the \"Touristic Bus\" for a tour, (Catalunya Square), The Museum of Modern Art, The Picasso Museum and the Gaudi buildings, along with many other landmarks. The California is a great base from which to experience every aspect of life in Barcelona, as long as you're happy with living briefly in an alley.

I was there during a festival, when it was difficult to get taxis/buses downtown, and they were very helpful providing suggestions about how to get to the airport. My room was small but spotless- a perfect base for exploring Barcelona. It is a bit difficult to find- but if you read other posts you will be fine. Our taxi couldn't get as close as usually because of all the festival related traffic, and we had to search for a bit- but it is literally right off of a main shopping street, and near a subway stop. The breakfast buffet is very generous for a complimentary breakfast, so I encourage you to take advantage of it. It is in a basement room that reminds me of a subway tunnel that had undergone a makeover show. I think there must have been lots of recent renos- lots of touches I wouldn't have chosen for my own home (e.g. Lighting in shower), but there was much more effort into mood/styling than you would typically find in a hotel in this price range.

As mentioned in other reviews the hotel is just off Las Ramblas and very easy to find. I did not find it noisy at night and I am a light sleeper. beds were vey comfortable and toilet was immaculate, clean towels every day which you do not get in some more exoensive hotels. Yes there is no view, our room was on the alley with a small balcony, ideal just for going out to have a quick ciggie rather than go down to front door to have one in the street. We were on 4th floor, very good double glazing which kept noise away. Breakfast was okay, choice of a couple of cold drinks, various coffees out machine (but good), crousants, rolls, cheese, ham, jams, cakes, 2 different cereals but not much more but adequate to get you started for the day ahead. A lot of hotels I looked at did not provide a breakfast at all. Now for the very good and the very bad:- The hotel was manned 24 hours to let residents in and out which was a very good safety feature, one of the clerks on the desk was very polite and helped us enourmously with travel questions and recommending some very good restaraunts, he was a credit to the hotel, another chap (did not get his name but had the look of the type that always had the unshaven look, he did not make much comments when he let you in our out but on our last day he was very rude. We came back to collect our luggage which they kindly look after for you if you are a late flight. When we came to ask for it, not knowing any spanish my wife just said \"cases\" meaning where do we get them and he just lost the plot \" Cases what you mean cases? blah blah blah (in spanish) rant rant rant\" If I was the owner of the hotel and heard this I would have sacked him on the spot. Apart from that read other reviews but as far as we were concerned, I would go back as it is good accommodation price wise compared to others in less prominent locations, metro station 2 mins away and you could walk from hotel to many of the sights, I would recommend getting a 2 day ticket for the hop on/off Touistic bus, good audio of places you pass and lets you decide where you would like to go and see later, three diffwrent routes and you could see practically the whole of the city.

I do not understand the previous reviews. I truly do not think the majority of them are valid and it's probably just management/front desk clerks writing false reviews to up their overall rating. This place 100% does NOT warrant all the \"Excellent\" ratings. Those ratings should be reserved for clean, decently sized rooms right below places 5 star places like the Four Seasons, etc. I'm thinking Comfort Inn, Holiday Inn, etc. This place is not much better than the yuckiest hostel. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it has (crappy) internet, a (yucky) breakfast, and good tv channels. My complete review: thanks to the gent who left the aerobus directions a few entries before mine. I followed them to a T and got here just fine. Upon entering, first you're struck by the gaudy, Eurodisco decorating theme in the lobby and the really pretty (male) desk clerk. He spoke reasonable English, no probs with check in. opened my door and was struck by how tiny it was. Literally, probably the size of some decent bathrooms. not too much of a problem since I'm travelling single but DO NOT stay here with another person unless you want their arm in your face the entire time. A/C works fine but I opened the window because it smelled really musty in the hallway and my room. Does not have a deadbolt or safe. My window does not face the street but it does face the middle of this complex and there's literally about 5 -6 feet of distance between my window and the next building so you hear/smell everything they are doing. Bathtub caulking covered in mold. Lots of lighting though so that's good. TV channel list was varied, 3-4 English channels and I think I even caught a German channel. INTERNET IS HORRIBLE!!!!! Constantly goes in and out. Desk workers are no help. they just shrug their shoulders and give the same excuse they've been using for years (re: old reviews) and saying the internet is kind of broken. No, the real reason is that management is too cheap to upgrade their infrastructure but are doing just the minimum to make sure they can claim to offer free internet while only a handful of rooms and the lobby actually get consistant single. Breakfast- pretty lame. Very low quality but if you're not a big breakfast eater, it suffices. I don't expect a magnificent breakfast buffet so this might be good for some. As a side, I believe this hotel caters to gay couples. i'm not 100% sure but if your preference is for something a little different, be aware. And if you're gay, there's a gay bar directly across the alley so it might be your thing because you have a 1 meter distance to stagger back for the evening. I would never stay here again and the only reason I'm staying here the entire 3 nights is because it was essentially for free through my airlines frequent flier program though I will recommend they delist this hotel as it's pretty unpleasant. Bottom line: do not stay here with small children or if you need consistent internet. Stay here if you are cheap, young (lots of nearby partying) , and only want a place to sleep.

Hence lost the balcony as well as the light and the view, but given that the only thing you do at a hotel in BCN is sleep, this was of no importance - my new room was very quiet and I slept like a baby!", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel\u201d", "Author": "RiverRanchTravels", "ReviewID": "UR115199056", "Content": "We were looking for a centrally-located place that would not break the bank and we were not disappointed.

I had read some wonderful reviews about the hotel and was ready looking forward to our stay. We walked into the front door of the hotel and the Front Desk Clerk was sitting there and did not even look up to greet us when we came in. I speak some spanish so I greet him with Hola como esta. Which he ( William) replied good and they I took out our papers to check into the hotel and put them on the counter. He then threw the booking sheets back at me and when on a rampage about coming to the desk and just slamminig down the papers and how dare we treat him like this etc, etc. I was shock but now getting my back up. I them told him I did greet him upon arrival and he had responded to me. At this point I was very upset with him and me friends finished the check in. We get up to our rooms and me friends had a small room like ours with a double and balcony and we had 2 twin so close together they could have been a double and not 2 twins. They rooms were clean, but I wanted to see if we could get a room with a balcony also. I went back down to the front desk and ask William if it was possible if we could get a twin room with a balcony. Even before he answer my question he started to greet another guest??? I then when outside to have a smoke and let him finish with this other guests and he asked me where did I think I was going? I told him to finish the converation with the other guest and I would be back in. So after 5 minutes of listening to Him tell me I could not speak to the Manager which I never asked to speak too I told him just leave the room as is and walked away. He them came around the corner yelling at me as I got onto the elevator. William is no asset to this hotel I will tell you. As far as the rest of the staff they would polite and nice to us and the breakfast was good and the hotel was clean and in a great location next to Las Ramblas. Once I go over William trying to be rude to me I did enjoy the trip to Barcelona. Would I go back to this Hotel. No because to the first interaction with William at the front desk.

Excellent hairdryer in the bathroom and a Tv in the bedroom. Clean towels and complimentary shampoo etc topped up every day. Very good breakfast (my daughter highly recommends the chocolate muffins). Helpful reception staff. In a central position, couldnt ask for more for the price. I booked the flight with Easyjet and was most impressed with their online checkin facilities and baggage drop off. Also booked the hotel with Easyjet. It is very cheap and easy to get to the hotel using the aerobus. When you come out of the terminal turn to your left and walk to bus stop B (about 150yards) you can buy a single ticket for E5+ and a return for E9+. An A1 or A2 bus will take you to Placa de Catalunya. It take about 20 - 30 minutes depending on traffic. Dont worry about not getting off at the right stop as it is the final destination. When you get off the bus cross the road and keep Hard Rock Cafe on your left. Turn left and walk down La Ramblas for about 7 minutes. On the left hand side you will come to a small road on your left with McDonalds on one corner and KFC on the other, turn left here. A couple of hundred yards on your right your will see O'Hara the irish bar and you turn right here and 50 yards down on the right is the hotel. When you want to return to the airport get the A2 arebus and get off at Terminal B, also known as Termial 2 if you've booked with Easyjet. The Easyjet Terminal in fact Terminal C but get off at B and walk for 5 minutes. Its not a problem.

I had booked a twin room but we were given a triple which possibly took away some of the room hence making the room feel smaller than it was. It was very basic but all you really need. No long mirror in the bedroom though - women will understand! :-) At night because our room was close to the main street, which contained about 5 irish bars all in a row, we did hear loud noise until about 3am every night - thankfully I had some ear plugs with me so was able to get some sleep. Other reviews had mentioned that their rooms had double glazing, unfortunately I think we may have had one of the older rooms. The free continental breakfast included in the price was also quite basic consisting of conrnflakes, muesli, croissants, 2 types of bread rolls, some cheese, ham, couple of mini muffins and a coffee/tea maker - no fruit or yoghurts. If it is cheaper to get the room without breakfast I would do that and pop into one of the bakeries located nearby or even the starbucks across the road! It filled us up till lunchtime though and is available from 7.30-10.30am each morning. Reception staff were always very pleasant and helpful letting us leave our bags with them when we checked out on the Sunday as our flight wasn't until the evening.

Our bathroom had a sliding door with a small terrace off of it, which provided lots of natural light to the room. The room had a large closet with lots of shelves and hangers and A/C. It was clean and quiet. The only downfall was the very hard bed. The price of the room was 85 Euros a night, which included breakfast. Breakfast was standard with cereal, breads, coffee, tea, juice and hot chocolate. The long hours for breakfast (8-11) were great. This was by far the best room we stayed in on our trip (out of 4) and the best value as well. I would stay there again!", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCould do with a lift!\u201d", "Author": "MissWright36", "ReviewID": "UR17745065", "Content": "I stayed at the Holel California in June 2008, for four nights. I really like the location of this hotel - it's really close to Las Ramblas and the harbour is a short walk from the hotel. I think the best thing about this hotel is the location. We were put on the third floor and there is no lift. It was not easy to carry a suitcase up the winding staircases!! When we got to our room, our room was like an oven. There is an air conditioning unit in the rooms but even on full power, it does nothing to cool down the heat from the rooms. It was quite difficult to sleep as the rooms were very stuffy. The rooms themselves are a good size, as is the bathroom. No full length mirrors though and we only had one plug socket in our room. There is a small balcony overlooking the street below. Having said all that, this hotel has character and the staff are really nice.

We all found it excellent value for money in an ideal location being just off La Ramblas, clean, towels changed daily, shampoo and soap were provided. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast consisted of cornflakes or muesli, croissants, Danish pastries, small rolls, jams, etc, fruit juice, tea & coffee - what else do you need. The only negatives were that there was no lift, no long mirror in the bedroom and no hairdryer but we were told that the hotel is due to have some major work done soon that will address some of these issues. As I have said this is a brilliant hotel with wonderful staff who you can have a laugh with (especially \"Prince\" William) and we would all recommend anyone staying there. They have a safe at Reception for your valuables and they will keep your cases in Reception if you have a later flight. We booked a minibus to collect us from the airport and return through Resorthoppa.com which was a really good deal and would recommend this too - they were efficient and vigilant. The queues for taxis at the airport were very long. We bought a 2 day Touristic bus ticket which enables you to hop on and off as many times as you want but BEWARE of thieves, my friend had an attempted purse snatch out of her bag whilst we were waiting for one of these buses and we were told if this happens a good way is to draw attention to the fact by shouting loudly SHE'S A THIEF, which I did many times but no one in the queue batted an eyelid - the good news was that she gave my friend her purse back - just be wary and have any bags hanging on the front of you. You receive a booklet on the purchase of your ticket with various discounts in them. We used a voucher for the Pans chain for lunch one day which entitled you to 2 drinks, 2 hot or cold baguettes and a portion of chips which we thought was reasonable value for 8 euros.

Arrangements were excellent with e-mails (in English) being answered / actioned very quickly; they asked for a confirmation one week before arrival. Reception very helpful but be aware there is no lift to any of the 3 floors. We were offered a choice of rooms and settled for room 103 (double on first floor on corner of the property, at the front). The self-service Continental breakfast was plentiful (but no ham, cheese, yoghurt or fruit). The rooms were clean but they could do with a bit more 'tender loving care' and some basic investment / up-grade of the mattress, top sheets and furniture; hot water was always available. The hotel location is very good on a street off the Ramblas. Good Irish Bars locally (try Molly's Fair City) and try the Schilling Bar for coffeee & beer as some on the street were rip offs (especially one close to / on the same side as the Schilling offering tapas). Do not eat at the Compestella Restaurant on this street as they could not get you out of the place quick enough (you only got an apple for your sweet on the tourist menu for 16 Euros!). For a quick, cheap lunch or snack try the Pans chain of sandwich shops. The best way to see the city is the Official Tourist Bus, but do not expect anyone to be courteous and queue as they charge on and even laugh at you when you complain; also use the vouchers they give you on the bus for discounts to attractions and for food. The only complaint we had was about the noise in the street outside the hotel - do not expect a good night's sleep as locals were drinking cans of beer outside the hotel (just in the street) up to 5.00 a.m. each evening / morning. The hotel is supposed to be double glazed with air-conditioning - the first doesn't work as you can hear every word spoken / shouted, but at least the air conditioning did. I would not like to stay here in the main holiday period in the summer months. In summary, it is worth the money for what you get and where it is.

But worse was the shower itself, which had no hot water pressure - leaving us to shower under the barest trickle of water. Despite repeated requests nothing was done to fix the shower, move us to an alternative room or give us a discount on the room rate. The only saving grace was that we were just in Barcelona for a weekend and so spent most of the time out of the room.
