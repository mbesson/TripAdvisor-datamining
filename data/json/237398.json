Everywhere near the Rialto Bridge and St Marks Square area is extremely expensive but we wanted to be central so had to pay (about 100 Euro's a night per room). Stayed in Venice a few times before on the Lido where you get much better value (and 3* or maybe 4*) but this trip we fancied a more central location and this was only 5 minutes walk to teh Rialto Bridge and about 10 minutes to St Marks. Ideal. Yes, our double room was small and the bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen. But, it was all pretty clean. Yes, the walls are very thin and you can hear people whispering as they walked past your door but we slept well and it all felt pretty safe and I think we sampled the REAL VENICE ! The area around the Hotel was safe and quaint but it's a shame the bar next door wasn't a little cheaper too just for convenience. Americans will hate the fact that there is no ICE in the hotel at all, or air conditioning, or a safe, or a pool. In fact it is pretty basic and you can't really relax anywhere except maybe in the breakfast area. I can't fault the staff though, like any staff in any hotel BE NICE and they will do what they can. To summarise I think this hotel is a quaint place to stay. There's canals all around you, cute narrow alleyways, busy shops and very handy for all the sights. Come with LOW expectations and you won't be disappointed ;o) You'll pay a similar price for hotels nearer to the Train Station but that's a full 20 minutes further away and nowhere near as nice an area. I wanted to come away with some great memories of Venice not the Hotel, so for me... job done ! Would I come to this hotel again, yes I think I might.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chichester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c\"value for money ???\"\u201d", "Author": "JAS486", "ReviewID": "UR122003362", "Content": "Stayed here for 6 days .

It is reasonable in price and good for those on a budget. The main rooms are basic and somewhat hot as no air con but not bad value if you want to save your euro for the amazing sights of this truly unique city on the water. I had booked through Otel.com on line and thought I had booked the double (matrimonial) room with the terrace. I even rang Otel to check and they assured me I had this room. Something went wrong and on arrival I had two nights in the basic standard room. But the staff at Hotel Canada did everything to rectify this and for my remaining two nights they were able to move me to Room Dodici B. This was amazing, as you will see from my pics. The view of top of San Marco is good and the room is comfortable, elegant and has air con (10 euro extra) but with sufficient breeze I did not need it and it was height of Venezia heat, being July. The staff are lovely and so helpful and even type their correspondence on a proper typewriter. This is truly a very Italian Hotel and adds to the charm and beauty of good old fashioned times gone by. They could not do enough for me and made me feel welcome and not like a single lone traveller, although I did come with friends who stayed elsewhere. It is excellent location for centrale Venice... 5 to 10 min walk to San Marco and about same to the Rialto. Great for picking up Vapereto and also travelling back to San Marco airport. The square where Hotel Canada is located is charming and has lots of great bars, shops. Safe to walk around at night (quite late) as I did on my own. The whole Centre feels safe and unthreatening. The breakfast is fine and one of the best continental ones I have had in this type of hotel. Despite other reviewers complaints I found it to be satisfying. You get plenty of great Italian coffee, juice, pastries and rolls, nice selection of jams and cream cheese. But then I am often happier with this type of breakfast. If you want full English don't to Europe, stay at home. This is better and healthier. I would definitely stay here again. However I strongly recommend going for room Dodici B (Twelve B). Having said that the basic rooms were clean and comfortable. I had to leave very early am to catch vapereto to airport and the eve before on my return the concierge greeted me with a tray of breakfast things and jug of juice (some of which I drank as very hot). The hotel bar was very reasonable and the staff would obligingly get me drinks even when it was late on. I found this hotel as recommended in my little AA travel guidebook and through the online website and otel.com. I have stayed in everything from 5 to 2 star and I really do want to go back to my little Hotel Canada and bella Venezia (soon).", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "OXFORDSHIRE", "Title": "\u201cGood budget hotel in an exceptional location.\u201d", "Author": "PETAOXF", "ReviewID": "UR45108961", "Content": "Hotel Canada is a good budget find if your expectations are modest. The biggest draw of the hotel is its superb location close to Piazza San Marco and Rialto. Additionally, the hotel is surrounded by restaurants and fabulous gelaterie and there is an inexpensive supermarket only steps away. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twenty or so rooms are arranged over two floors. Some rooms have canal views whilst others look directly onto other buildings. The rooms themselves have tiled floors and are very basically furnished but are acceptable for the price. The 1970s bathrooms however, are badly in need of renovation (some have enclosed showers whilst others have a wet-room set-up). In our room, the water-pressure was abysmal. At best, it was very weak, and at worst (on at least two mornings), we had no water at all\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not joking. Furthermore, our room was not all that clean\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cleaning schedule only consists of changing the linen and giving the bathroom the quickest of wipe-overs: everything looked like it could have done with a good scrub (especially the mouldy shower). However, apart from these concerns, we liked our light-filled room (that was not without charm) and its small terrace nestled amongst the Venetian rooftops. Avoid the breakfast if you can though, as it is truly atrocious. On offer were hard stale-tasting bread rolls, soggy \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcairline-style\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 croissants and imitation orange juice.

The breakfast room which overlooks the small square below, is pleasant enough, but spoilt by the noise of the TV (showing the news). I would recommend Hotel Canada to those on a tight budget despite the issues I have mentioned as the rooms are far from unpleasant, the rates are cheap, the location is great and the people working in the hotel are very nice.

All the staff we encountered were very pleasant and eager to please, and the room we were given was spacious enough and had a view of a small canal outside (which I had requested when booking). Unlike another reviewer, we had no problems with the bathroom or shower, which was in an enclosed unit in the corner. Breakfast was basic, but adequate to start the day. We did, however, glimpse a couple of other rooms, facing the front of the hotel, which appeared to be not much larger than the bed, so beware and ask for a larger room. The location is fantastic, within a couple of minutes of the Rialto Bridge and seconds from many shops and restaurants. There is also a so-called Irish pub next door, although the Irishness doesn't in fact extend to more than having a couple of Irish beers on tap. Venice presents a unique challenge, though, in that you cannot get a taxi to the front door of your hotel. We encountered many tourists wheeling suitcases and looking confused in the narrow lanes, as were we upon our arrival. I suggest, as we did, that if possible you check in some of your luggage at the airport and just take what you need for your stay into Venice itself. In that regard, the 'map' that the hotel provides on its website is hopelessly inadequate, made to look old in line with the location, when a clear and simple street/lane layout would be much better. Once you know the way from the Rialto waterbus stop, it is a simple two minute walk. Booking months in advance, we paid 90 Euros a night, which was superb value, and I would certainly stay there again. Two days in Venice, though, is enough, so instead I'll just recommend it to friends.", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, MO", "Title": "\u201cHorrible experience\u201d", "Author": "lac_11", "ReviewID": "UR5230088", "Content": "The only thing positive to say about this hotel is the location, which was excellent.
