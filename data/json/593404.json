I was looking at some hotels on the Internet and Klas Hotel seemed very nice. I opted for an executive room for more room space and comfort. When we arrived we were welcomed at the reception and I can say that the welcoming was fairly ok even if there was no thorough explanation on the Hotel as it is usual to receive when staying in 4/5 star hotels. We went up to our room and it was then that we received the first shock. The room carpet was full of stains making the room looking filthy. The duvet and the pillow cases were also stained. The bed for one of my kids was not a bed at all, they just put two mattresses on each other and covered with a sheet and blanket. The balcony was filthy with cigarettes buds all over the place and the room was also smelling of cigarette smoke even if they tried hard to mask it with air freshner. The house keeping is terrible, they just made the beds and that was it. One day I had to request a sheet for my daughters improvised bed as they removed it and did not replace it back. The floor was never vacuumed cleaned during the whole stay, not allowing my kids to walk bare footed or even play on the carpet. Glasses and tea cups were also left uncleaned for the whole stay. It was advertised that bathrobes and slippers are available, but I still have no clue were these items were. On a four night stay, I had to call three times the reception to rectify things, the first time the service was prompt but as for the others I had to wait for 30 min to get things done. The positive things this hotel has to offer are masked by the poor quality they offer to clients. Location of this hotel is very good as you can reach almost everywhere by foot or by tram which is situated at a short walk away from the hotel. In general, I can say that our trip to Istanbul would have been perfect if it was not ruined by all the complaints mentioned above!", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cCity break\u201d", "Author": "GeomagsScotland", "ReviewID": "UR126847863", "Content": "The Klas hotel situated in old Istanbul is ideally situated for visiting the main attractions eg. the Blue Mosque & the Topkapi Palace.

They hotel lobby is already a dark hole and the rooms are very old fashion and not really clean. After we especially booked Klas hotel so we can have some modern rooms, we ended up in this place.

Let's start with check-in into this 3 stars (opps, it's really not a 4 star hotel please). You get a bell boy who drags your bags down the lobby steps when there's a ramp just by the side! If your bag wheels gets damaged, it won't be the best start to your holidays, would it. Next, when you check in, its your obligation to bring out all the paper work to show to them that your booking's made and what room you room you are signed up for. Then, they double check with their paperwork which is kept in the most horrendous falling to pieces plastic file you can ever imagine! And if there's any reservation matters to be clarified, you have to wait for Ms Tamara Gorkova to come in to work and you then have to bring your case forwards to her. It doesn't matter if you have business to attend/ a city tour to join-you have to be there while Ms Tamara is working during her office hours. Nobody else ca attend to your query. And despite their clearly stated 24 hours cancellation policy, if you've booked 5 nights in a row, and you decide to check out earlier, its money down the drain because its ONE booking. So, next time, remember to make 5 separate 1 night bookings if you still want to go to Klas (not classy) hotel. Their rooms being small is the understatement of the year-bend down to pick up that soap you dropped in the shower, and you are going to bring the shower plastic walls down! And there's this big sign on the mineral water they provide you-ONLY 1 BOTTLE FOR EACH STAY. It doesn't depend how long you stay there, and when my son tried filling up the bottle during breakfast, he received a gruff telling off by the cafe captain-where's the charm, man? You did go to Hotel School/Uni didn't you, Mr Captain?The only thing Ms Tamara is good at would be to write a retort to this letter which I am sure she will. The funny thing is I sent off 5 Trip Advisor messages to the last 5 reviewers asking more details about Klas Hotel before I made a booking, and guess how many replies back I got?-ZILCH! Doesn't it make you wonder?-That's a line from a Led Zepellin song, isn't it? So, don't take that stairway that leads to Un-Klassy Hotel!

So it must have been my lucky day, because Klas Hotel\u00c2\u00b4s Sales Manager Ms. Tamara Gorkova sent me the nicest reply and upon arrival she appeared to welcome me personally with some refreshments in spite of extremly busy hours. The stay itself proved to be just as fine, since I had quite busy days the hotel had to be my calm and luxury oasis in the desert. The room itself was maybe a bit small but quite okay for resting and sleeping, (and thanks God for the huge king size bed that occupied most of my room, that was an absolute favourite and I was extremly pleased with it :-). The room-maid (I never saw her or him) kept it clean for me and brought me new towels every day. It was not really needed, but indeed excellent service. She or he also filled up my free supplies of teas, coffees and mineral water as much as needed. Let me also give some credit to the staff at the front desk where I spent time checking my mails at a courtesy customer-computer. Same friendly faces met me every day with a personal greeting and a little chat, immediately ready to assist when asking for directions of places of interest, trams, busses and stores when preparing for a few hours out in the nearby shopping-district on my last day before flying home. Klas Hotel is actually quite convenient located, only some 10 minutes by foot to the well-known Aksaray Metro- and Bus Station). And that goes for everybody I met at Klas Hotel, they all were very gentle, hospitable and friendly... and I definitely would like to include also the breakfast-staff in the restaurant. Very helpful and service-mined. I spent almost an hour every morning enjoying the hotel\u00c2\u00b4s breakfast-buffet offering lots of goodies for every taste, like lots of fresh fruit of all kinds, different cheeses and sausages, bread and pastries, juices etc etc etc, you name it ;-))).
