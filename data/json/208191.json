They could not have been nicer. Many TVs in the restaurant/bar, and seriously LOTS of beers from all over world. Room location was in a \"tower\" reached by exiting the elevator, then walking through an ice/vending-machine room which did NOT look like it led anywhere.....but led to a long narrow hallway lined with windows facing a city view. But the window for the room itself faced the hall. So your view was through room window, across the hall, and out hall window. Of course anyone walking in hall would see into your room, so basically no view since we closed shades. This was described as a special room for Sheraton members. (I forget what their program is called.) It was fine for one night with an early next day flight, but....weird. Room had not been renovated recently, older fixtures, etc. But was VERY CLEAN.

One tower has rooms with windows facing the hallway (like a motel) so when you open the curtains people walking down the hall can see in. If you are staying for more than a day or two make sure to request a room in one of the other 2 towers. After getting place in the \"motel tower\" I requested to be moved as I was staying 5 nights. They moved me to the tower adjacent to Airport Blvd. The room was nicely update and had a great refrigerator, but the windows are old and are not sound proofed. Consequently there was a stiff breeze blowing in where the windows didn't quite close (their energy bill must be huge!) and there was a lot of road noise. So if you are a light sleeper request a room that doesn't face the road. I should say they also offered to move me away from the road noise on Airport Blvd to the tower that is currently being renovated. But the floor that was available they had just put in new carpet and the fumes from the carpet were strong. So, if you don't like strong chemical smells make sure you don't get a \"just renovated\" room.

I went down to the front desk to ask for the room that I had reserved. No explanation or apology was given, but I was re-assigned to a Deluxe room.

The parking area is very dark. You can valet, but the valet service is pretty hit or miss because most people don't valet at this hotel. I've checked in when there was nobody available to park my car so I had to go to the scary dark parking lot. Also, they don't secure the elevators in the hotel and I've ridden the elevator with some scary individuals that might not have even been hotel guests. I just get the willies when I get off on my floor not knowing if someone may be lurking. I just don't feel safe for some reason in this hotel. I travel every week so it's not like I'm paranoid.

We stayed here less than a year ago, and I feel bad for not writing this review sooner. The details mentioned in this review may vary by a little bit since I don't remember them exactly. --ABOUT THE SERVICE-- We booked this hotel for one night because I had an important job interview to go to in West Hollywood and this hotel was at a convenient location. The price it offered was very reasonable (I think just over $100). We booked this for the night before my interview so we could have a restful sleep there before I had to go. Now, my entire trip started off really bad. Preparing for the interview took much longer than I expected. By the time we finally left, we were 10 hours behind schedule. This caused us to arrive at the hotel at 8am. My interview was at 11am, and about 15-20min drive away. At this time, we already knew we couldn't sleep in a nice comfortable bed before I had to go, but I just wanted a place to change, shower, and get ready. We went up to the counter and explained our situation, but the guy there said they were completely booked and would not have a room for us until 10am. Now, this immediately sparked my attention. I had already booked a room for that previous night, so while the employee did not say it directly, I realized that the hotel had overbooked my room. I brought this to his attention, but all he could tell me was that he was very sorry and he would get a room for me as soon as possible, while we could rest in the lobby in the meantime. For this, I don't blame the employee. I understand there was nothing to be done at that time, and I can't just force someone out of a room. What really irked me was that in the end, the only sort of compensation we were given were 2 coupons for free coffee (we don't drink coffee) and a \"complimentary late checkout\" (which we didn't even need) and the employee disgruntledly told me it was a \"$45 value.\" In fact, I only got the late checkout because I complained about the compensation. We left the hotel at 2pm. If I had gotten there at 8am, and they had given me the room that I had booked, I would have happily stayed there for 4 hours and checked out, since getting there late was my fault. Instead, I was out of even a place to shower, and they provided me no satisfactory compensation for overbooking my room, which was their fault. I cannot say I was happy with how they handled the situation. --ABOUT THE ROOM-- For the brief period we were in the room itself (I was able to get in there for 15 min to change and then take a short nap after the interview), it was alright. The beds were super comfy (or maybe that was from the lack of sleep), and the room looked nice. The bathroom had stains and broken tiles, however.

When I returned @ 2P my King size bed was not ready so he placed me in a double queen ( I was still early for check in @ 3P. I was worn out from flying so early in the AM and at this point and didn't care where I slept lol). The room was fantastic with the double queen beds. It was very large with huge windows. The decor was HOTEL NICE. The both beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows. I especially liked the two large pillows to prop up and sit up in bed. I think my rooms was missing the paintings for the wall for as there was just one in the corner. Flat Screen with plenty of channels.Free internet. Free bottled water. Refrigerator. Coffee maker (coffee supplied was ok). iron/board. I wanted a safe and a microwave and I would be happier with the room. The bathroom was roomy and lit very well. They have these light switches that turn on the lights when you walk into the bathroom and hall near the door. Kind of neat when I woke up in the middle of the nite use the bathroom. The bar downstairs served really good drinks. I did have room service and my med well hamburger was dry and tasteless. I would have done better going across the street to burger king. This was great location close to the airport. There is a shuttle bus that runs frequently. They have hotel buses that will take you to local areas restaurant, mall, grocery store.

The bed was very comfortable and the sheets had a strong smell of bleach, which I can overlook for the most part. There were a lot of dings and dents throughout the room but overall, it was a pleasant place to stay. You can hear the people in the next room through the shared door, but thank god they weren't roudy or rude. Other than that it was pretty quiet. There was a situation with the elevators. We wanted to go eat and out of the three elevators that were there, only one worked at around 10pm, when there were maybe 8-9 people waiting. And the elevators were very small and EXTREMELY SLOW for just having only three so it was about a 10 minute wait for an elevator to go up and come back down. In the morning, two of the three were operational. We were excited to see that they had room service, but at a 16% gratuity and a $3 delivery charge, we decided to not waste our money, especially not knowing if the food would be any good. So we decided to go downstairs to the Bar and Grill restaurant in the lobby, and it was packed. No one greeted us at the door, which would have been fine if they were busy, but the staff was just standing around, chatting. There was plenty of seating in the back which were we were going to sit, but that is when we attracted one of the waiters. The waiter was not helpful or welcoming at all. He handed us two menus, which was a wrinkled, single sheet of card stock, and then walked off. THE PARKING This situation alone killed the experience at the hotel. In the front, there is valet parking, which was empty, because I believe no one would want to pay $25 a day for parking. We were able to park in a space in the area that was not sectioned off as Valet, the first night we arrived with no issue. Apparently, when you first check-in, you can park in that area, but after than you would have to pay $19 a night to park in a jam packed parking lot in the back.

The shuttle works well, and even though it's shared with the Westin in didn't take long to get there. On the way back it's only a few minutes to the airport because it doesn't make any stops. Checkin was very friendly and efficient. I was informed about the free wifi, which worked well. There was a slight issue in that I had been assigned someone else's room (they were not there yet, but had a personalized letter waiting) but it was sorted out quickly and efficiently. I found the hotel rather loud. There was some noise from the other rooms, but mostly aircraft noise. The runways at LAX are somewhat offset and many hotels sit practically between the runways, so the noise alternates between one plane's engines spooling up for takeoff and another one booming by on final approach to the airport. That's not the hotel's fault though, and a problem all of the hotels near the airport have. However, the windows didn't seem particularly high-quality, so perhaps that increased the noise levels. Biggest gripe: No hot shower in the morning. I let the water run for several minutes but it wouldn't get hot.

Good was the free wi-fi, there was very little airport noise; room was clean and adequate size. If we needed anything, the hotel was quick to supply us (like an extra bar of soap since one bar wasn't enough for two people for the length of time we were there). Concierge was very helpful. There are good options for restaurants within 3-5 miles of the hotel. That is a real plus when you realize how long it takes you to get 3-5 miles in LA with the traffic. A 3 mile ride can take 30 minutes or more. The bad - Our room was 64 degrees and the only way we could warm it up was to turn off the a/c and open the door. We called and were told it was area controlled and that was our only option. Our room opened to a hallway and all night long partiers were slamming doors, laughing, talking loudly and so needless to say, we got little rest. If we could have left the a/c running, it might have drowned out some of the noise. Parking at the hotel is expensive, as it is everywhere in LA. Be prepared to pay to park even while you are dining at expensive restaurants. The worst was not the hotel's fault, but the terrible experience we had with the car rental agency in the hotel when we had a medical emergency back home and tried to leave a day early. I strongly recommend that you go directly across the street and rent from Budget Rent A Car, where the customer service is excellent. In the restaurant, the chicken quesadillas, fish tacos and the balsamic vinagrette dressing on the salads we had were wonderful. Service was polite and very quick.

The Free Airport Shuttle dropped us off at the front entrance of Fourt Points with our luggage. We gave him $10 for the ride and for handling our luggage from start to finish. Helpful when you are jet tired. Inside the Hotel I saw a long line of people as I approached the desk. It was manned by 2 people. And I saw a SPG PREFERRED GUEST counter beside me, so I stood there clueless, thinking the Assigned Agent had stepped away or something, until somebody in line said to me: I'M A PREFERRED GUEST, TOO BUT THAT COUNTER IS CLOSED. I WISH IT WERE OPEN! Oops. I went to be the back of the line. While standing there-- I noticed that the Spacious Lobby offered free Internet Terminals-- they are Large Screened IMACS mostly unused. But inviting where they sat. Guess everybody carries their own computer now. They had our reservation ready once I reached the desk. About an hour later, when I came back down, the PREFERRED GUEST counter was up and running with zero lines, The Bellcop counter very ready to take our luggage up for us. We wanted them to take it up for us because it had been a long flight. We gladly gave the Bellhop $7 for moving 5 pieces of Luggage for us. The room we got was a free upgrade because I am GOLD MEMBER-- and it was a great space with a view of the airport! You can open the window and let in the outside air. Very rare thing to able to do anymore in a hotel room. They gave us 2 Queen Beds that each come with a great many pillows of all sizes. Very fun. (In the Morning we opened the windows looking out at Thick Morning Fog!) The bath essentials are displayed in a whimsical way-- with accompanying lierature about Green Issues and Product Origin. Nice. They give you just enough for 2 people regarding shampoo, lotion, etc. When I turned the Shower Knob to COLD Setting, I got HOT water instead. It was a medium strong stream once it got started. Wi Fi is not the strongest signal in the hotel. Just enough to check email but slow to try checking in ONLINE with Airline. Gave up doing that and decided to check in at the airport. We told ourselves we wanted Big Greasy CheeseBurgers with Beers when we returned to the States from Japan. After checking in at the Hotel we hit the streets on foot and found DENNYS SPORTS BAR AND GRILL near the Hilton. Easily within walking Distance just past the Gas Station you will pass. In between Dennys and Fourt Points, there are many hotels with numerous kind of places to eat-- Sports Grills, Steak Houses, Fish Purveyors and fast food like Burger King. I almost decided to eat in another Hotel just for the fun of it. We did not eat at our Hotel but they do have a Restaurant and the Menu looked Hearty and Delicious. The Hotel bar is ample and good. They have a wide and deep variety of beers. And they can make any cocktail you want. Screens show sports above the bar. High Tables and SeatBack tables available with Wait Service, if you don't want to sit at the long curved bar. The Bartenders seemed to know many of the People at the Bar-- as they talked about where they just flew in from. Lively! They also serve an Awesome Looking Bar Burger!! All the folks at the counter Ooohhed! in awe when a guy was served up his order! Made me salivate despite just getting back from DENNYS! I wish we had eaten in our Hotel Bar. During the night the Hotel leaves your Final Bill. You can go along your way now! Over all, I would stay here again and I recommend that you try it out when you are near. One more thing... the Pool was due to be closed for repairs. The Hotel made arrangements with Nearby Hotels that looked Classy so that guests could use their Pool and Gym.

The rooms are clean, good free wi-fi, there isn't fridge in the rooms but on each floor there are Pepsi brand vendor machines (2 $ for a bottle of 50 oz, and they also take 1 cent coin). The position of the Four Points makes it convenient, you can walk to the most important car hire (Budget is in front, not far from Avis, Hertz is a 5 minute walk along Airport Boulevard). If I have to find a flaw, I can only talk about the slowness of the three elevators that handle the seven floors of the building. The Four Points offers the possibility to print for free your boarding pass, something comfortable for those who travel between airports and look for a hotel to sleep, relax, waiting for another flight or to visit the LAX area by rental car.

It was a great service, and all done with a smile. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also, in the lobby, a computer and printer where you can print out your boarding pass for free. (Many hotels will charge you to access and print boarding pass.) And did we mention the free Granny Smith apples, just ready for the taking, at check-in? The Four Points LAX also has a devoted following of beer aficionados, who come here specifically for the incredible array of gourmet, craft beers available in its pub, Brewster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink alcohol, but even we were impressed when we read about the fine array of micro-brewed beers that are available here. Brewster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s features 16 tap beers and more than 100 bottles of beer. The six poolside taps are 100 percent dedicated to small local breweries such as Strand Brewing, Torrance, California; Cismontane Brewing, Rancho Santa Margarita, California; and Tustin Brewing, Tustin, California. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re someone who is into microbreweries, this is the place for you.

After my stay at the Sheraton Gateway LAX, I have to post. First of all the rate seemed too good to be true. I had read the negative reviews and thought -its a Sheraton property who bad can it be? I booked direct with the hotel. I have stayed at various LAX hotels but never at the Four Points LAX. The rate was what encouraged me to give it a try. When I arrived the lobby looked clean and pleasant. The check in was not warm and friendly. It was very matter of fact. The windows along the walkway to my room were filthy. The maids in the hallway were accompanied by a man that I caught staring into the room of a guest. I looked to see what he was looking at and it was a another female guest (creepy). The windows face into hallway that has windows to the outside. Everyone walking by can see into your room if you raise the blinds. Dirty room service trays were sitting in the hallway. My arrival to the room was a huge disappointment. It smelled musty and damp. There were stains on everything. The decorative pillows on the bed looked stained and well worn. The bedspeads were tired. There were no cups for the mini coffee maker. The room was basic old and roughed up. It looked like they had painted over mold in the bathroom. The tub was cracked and stained. The carpet was dirty. There was rust all around the door frame in the bathroom. The A/C did not work well. Then the bed...very tired sagging and old! So uncomfortable. Now I understood the low rate. O and for breakfast you can have for $10.00 (+ gratuity/svc chg) a bowl of oat mill - by the time you add to that coffee and juice (well you get the point a very pricey breakfast. The maids will start yelling down the hall at each other at 6am. They will bang their carts around and do everything to wake everyone up. After looking back through the reviews I now understand. The Manager refers to their remodeling etc. The should advise that for the low rate, you get a room that is subpar to an old Quality Inn. It should be embarrassing to Sheraton to allow these rooms to be in their network. \"Traditional Room\" - means old tired and musty. \"Deluxe\" means we give you the quality that you expect out of Sheraton. I am sure GM Phil will be happy to get all those who are disappointed into one of the \"Deluxe\" rooms for the same low rate when they return -HA! This GM needs to spend some nights in his \"traditional rooms\". When I checked out, The lady did not ask about my stay (she probably knew). She did not say good morning/ thank you or get lost. When I said I was checking out she said \"didn't you get the receipt under your door?\" Sorry Sheraton Four Points ...you do not get my vote. Who will want to return when you finish your remodeling??? You did not win my business and won't get it again! I work for a major corporation that travels into LAX frequently and Four points will not be our hotel of choice. If this place had a manager, they would at least QC their older rooms and keep them as clean as possible - and throw in a free continental breakfast. It would certainly do something to say ** \"Hey we are not what we are going to be..but we want you to know we appreciate you putting up with our very rough edges\" **. \"Here is a coupon for a free breakfast and please come back when we finish our remodeling\". That would work for me! Or how about a clean room and a small basket with a banana and a muffin and have a card that says \"Thank You\". And actually have cups in the room so people can use the coffee maker. Or have a central area on each floor in the morning with fresh coffee. I guess I can't turn my marketing mind off. There is so much this hotel *could do* if they only had imagination and had someone with initiative to lead.

We travel in and out of the US via LAX so the location is perfect for us. If you're in LA on holiday, there are much better locations to stay, but if you're here for business and connecting through LAX, it's hard to beat. You can check in and check out at any time during the day or night, so you're not stuck with that problem of arriving at LAX at dawn, only to be told by reception that your room will not be available until after lunch. The Starwood Preferred Guest system works well and we often get a room upgrade - try not to stay in the Tower but ask for one of the recently renovated rooms on the upper floors of the main building. The new rooms have a strange designer storage system, where you put your stuff in cartons, instead of drawers, but it's no big deal. Four Points has retired the old polyester bed covers and linens, so the beds are comfortable and clean. Check-in could be faster, because they're usually short-staffed, but we like the people and put up with the wait. The coffee shop is over-priced and the breakfast is not great if you prefer to eat healthy, so we drive a mile to Trader Joe's and buy our own ingredients, stopping at Starbuck's along the way. If you don't have a car you can walk to the Starbucks next door in the Marriott. There's an ACE car rental office in the hotel which simplifies returning your car, and Budget car rental is directly across the road. ACE counter staff are incredibly slow at checking out cars, and if there are two or three customers waiting you'll spend at least an hour in line. We've never had any problems with ACE cars and they're much cheaper than Budget, but there are some horror stories about them online that you might want to read before renting - buyer beware. Parking at Four Points is $15 per day, you can usually get an undercover spot which is unusual for the LAX area, and the parking is on the hotel property - unlike the nearby Sheraton which offers parking at a remote site out back of the hotel strip. If you're accustomed to the service levels of a four star or five star hotel in Asia, the Four Points at LAX will come as a major shock - you get your own luggage out of the car, you put it on a luggage cart yourself, and you push it to check-in by yourself - usually while the guys at the concierge desk watch you. But you can get a room more or less any time during the year at under $100, there's a fridge in the room and the internet's free - so if you're a business traveler without a lot of luggage, this hotel saves you money on tips and it's really convenient.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Mateo, California", "Title": "\u201cCollege move-in weekend in LA\u201d", "Author": "Marlo G", "ReviewID": "UR118132348", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel since it was one that had a special family rate by my child's college and it turned out to be a pleasant place to stay.

Stay away from the horrible central tower, room numbers from about 32 to 59 or so. Other towers are just fine. The perfect: The 24 hour check-in promo, still available on the hotel's web site as of this writing (Aug, 2011). If you have a red eye flight, you can check in for 24 hours, so you can check out not at noon on the day of the flight, but at 9pm for instance. It requires you to check in at 9pm or later the day of your check-in. This was absolutely unbelievable: I didn't need to check out in the morning, could work in the office all day on Friday, get back to the hotel around 8pm, take a shower and change, relax a little and make it without rush to the 11pm flight back to DC. You have to email the hotel after making the reservation and ask for the 24-hour check-in. I think it's designed for the one night stands, but I stayed there twice, for 5 and 4 nights and was able to get this promo with no issues. If I were managing this hotel (or others for that matter), I'd switch all my rates to 24 hours -- the cost of having a few extra maids to turn rooms around in the evening would probably be much less than the added revenue from happy guests. The noon checkout at hotels is an atavism from the old times in my opinion, especially so for the west coast. The good: All the staff, except for one scared front desk clerk, are very helpful, courteous and can handle the high load of guests supremely well. The management is especially willing to sort out issues even when the issue is not the hotel's fault. I am impressed and that's not easy to do. Convenient location for everything, including LAX; you get a free shuttle there, too, that runs every 10-15 mins or so. If you are arriving in the evening and need a car from Budget (horrible service, but cheap) in the morning, make the car reservation for the morning: you can walk across the street and pick up the car. OK food in the restaurant for dinner, don't know about breakfast. Rooms outside of the central tower (those that aren't numbered 32-59 or so) are very much standard for Four Points with all the standard stuff, including a bottle or two of water that's free. The rooms are a bit more spacious than your typical Four Points, even, somewhere in the range of Marriott's Courtyard. Cool views both on the west and on the east, especially if, like me, you like to watch planes. Decent coffee and pastry stand in the morning, spacious and pleasantly looking lobby. Outside swimming pool. Car rental agency inside the hotel. I can't comment on it, I didn't use them, but I saw a few people do, so I imagine they are not terrible. The bad: Not much, except for slow service at the bar and the central tower, but the latter is way beyond bad, it's ugly. Naturally, the hotel's computers aren't designed to handle the 24hr check-in, so one of the two times I didn't leave my stuff in the room in the morning of the Friday and got kicked out despite the 'do not disturb' sign. When i got back at 8pm, the room had already been given to someone else, but the management admitted the mistake, apologized, gave me another room for an hour, offered a dinner and generally handled the situation in an extremely professional manner. So, if you are doing the 24hr check-in, in the morning of the check-out day stop by the front desk and ask them to make sure your key card will work and the parking pass if you have it will work. What they do is simply change the dates on both for the following day and the computer shows the room as occupied and your keys work. You do not get charged for an extra night. The ugly: The central tower. The main problem there is that it's designed like an old motel: you have the windows of your room facing not outside of the building, but outside in the hall where people walk. So, you have a choice: either draw your vinyl window shade completely and have no natural light in the room, or have your privacy. Can't have both, 'cause the window is big and if your curtain is not drawn completely, you are like in a zoo on display for everyone, who walks by to view. I, for one, can't wake up without the natural light and I value my privacy, so the one week I stayed there it was a torture. The central tower rooms are tiny, not enough space to even put the ironing board except it one corner of the room, but then you can't walk around it.

I would like to share my horrible experience with all travellers around the world who are going to Los Angeles either for vacation/business or with a family, especially Europeans who might not be aware of the situation. Do not stay here. Its not worth it. Location is not to far from a bad side of town. Paid the entire stay in advance, 2 nights, $190 in full - several days ago with a credit card. At the check-in, a woman by the name of \"G\" ( name witheld by the author ) the unfriendly supervisor, demended additional $100 in cash or $50 with credit card a day, additional \"deposit\" just in case that : \" when we leave we do not take their flat TV ( the one they so desperatelly advertise ) with us back home. Even though these 2 nights were booked and paid in advance entirelly - IN FULL - she stated that if I do not give additional $100 in cash \"for the unforseen situations in the future\", we can go to another hotel. As you can see, the staff here wasn't friendly, efficient and helpful. She clearly demonstrated she did not care if I would stay there or not - and if 2 nights were already paid. She said that if I dont give her additional $100 in cash she would not check me in but would not hesitate to call the police and ask me to leave the property if necessary even though 2 nights were already paid in FULL. I have degree in Criminology and this was totally out of line for a hotel supervisor to say to a guest who already invested money in this travel, flight and hotel. I did not get used to such terrible and direspectful hotel check-in service, I was shocked for awhile in disbelief. She then offered me to refund my booking agency in full for both nights, would not check me in - without $100 in cash under any circumstance, however the refund money for 2 nights which had been already paid in full - would be posted back to my Credit Card and become available in a week from now. In other words, this hotel got paid for 2 nights in advance, in FULL and secured the payment in FULL - made a promise that I would have this room for 2 nights, but would not care if they cancel my stay at the Check-in point unless I give them additional $100 in cash, which would leave me to have NO hotel for 2 nights. While they still have my $190 which would be unavailable to me for another 7 days. I so badly wanted to make reservation with another hotel. When the business doesnt care about having the payment in full already in their hands and in advance, and they treat me as if - my money and time does not matter to them, and their promise means nothing, the reservation means nothing, the relationship with booking agency means nothing, the payment in full in advance means nothing, I as a guest mean nothing - then I do not want to reward the bad business for the bad business and a bad treatment. However, my option to make reservation the very same hour, and the very same day with another hotel were limited at that point, and would require another $200 dollars, because the reservation would have to be made the very same day - and I would have to travel to that place, and pay all inconvencies myself, in addition to spending another $200 and lose additional valuable time! Had I known this will take the place, I could have picked another hotel and had great experience. I travel relativelly often, prior to this hotel, had stayed in 2 other hotels in Los Angeles. Neither insisted on additional cash for already paid nights in advance, had undisclosed hidden charges, put a condition on a check-in or offered such a poor treatment to the guests! I want to save someone else the headache of staying in this hotel: don't ever consider staying at the Four Points LAX.

The shuttle service was shared between the Four Points and another property nearby. Even at 11 PM and 11 AM (times we used the shuttle), the buses were PACKED and only came every 20-30 minutes. Be ready to wait for an extra shuttle if you're towards the end terminals at LAX! Now onto the hotel itself- The lobby was nice enough, there's a restaurant, bar and a gift shop. The restaurant that we had planned to eat at had closed earlier and the gift shop was also closed. This left us pretty much one option as far as food- room service. There aren't any other food options within walking distance except a Burger King down the road, so keep that in mind. The room itself left much to be desired. The hotel rooms look very, very worn. You can tell that the non-smoking rooms were converted because the walls still smell of decades of smoke. The bed was the most rock solid thing I think I've ever slept on, and the outside noises were pouring in through the poorly insulated window. The air conditioning hardly worked, it kept the room around 80 degrees overnight- which was actually warmer than it was outside. The bathroom was pretty small and the tub looked 30+ years old, it had to be the oldest tub I've ever seen at a hotel! They had the typical \"fake ceiling\" that is used to cover up an older, mold damaged ceiling. The sink was built onto a wooden vanity constructed on a base of some unpainted 2X4's, maybe they had just replaced the wood or something, but it looked tacky as heck. Overall the property is old and shows it's age. The \"non smoking\" aspect doesn't fly when the hallways and rooms just reek of lingering decades of smoke. We got a decent deal (under $90) but in the end, there were properties around the area that were a few bucks more and next time I'll be looking into one of those.

Maybe my memory is faulty, or more likely, the hotel has gone down hill ... a lot! When I checked in, I was given a room in the back building, which requires a walk through the ballroom area to a very remote bank of elevators. No big deal, but that building seems to have been annexed onto the main building (because the upper floors don't line up. Perhaps the distance from the main building is a problem for the housekeeping staff, because when I got there (to a very hot room), the bathroom was short some towels and soap, and worse, there was a wet dirtly towel lying on the desk!! So, frustrated (and not wanting to collect my things and trek back to the front desk, I called housekeeping and let them know that I needed some soap and clean towels, and asked them to remove the dirty towel. They said they'd send someone up ... and when he arrived, he had the coffee that (he thought) I'd requested! (What? ... Coffee? ... How does \"Soap\" sound like \"Coffee\"??) (He did bring some, but not all the towels). Anyway, after asking him to remove the dirty towel (which evidently they hadn't told him about), he did go back and get the bar of soap I'd requested. After that, I went down to the (mostly empty) restaurant for a quick dinner. When I got to the restaurant reception desk, there was a very frustrated couple having a heated conversation with the gentleman behind the counter. When they stormed off, he showed me to my table and appologized that I had to hear the dissagreement with the previous patrons (although he placed all the blame on them). The waiter brought me a menu and some rolls. Then I waited, for about 15 mins, until another person was seated near me, and the waiter finally came back to take my order. When I asked what the \"catch of the day\" was, he said \"tilapia\". When I hesitated, he said the also have \"fillet of sole\" ... which I ordered. Imagine my surprise when he brought my dinner, and it was swordfish! Not a problem, really, but he didn't seem to notice until I called him on it! After dinner, I asked the waiter what time breakfast was served (since I had an 8:30 flight out). He said they open for breakfast at 6:00 am (which would just about give me enough time to have a quick breakfast and catch the shuttle to the airport (about a 1/2 mile) in the morning in time for my flight. Also, at a hotel at this level, you don't expect to see an old curved screen CRT television ... maybe it's a \"retro\" thing? Oh well, I only needed to stay for the one night, so the next morning I got up early enough to get ready and go down for breakfast (which was included as part of my room package). I arrived back at the restaurant at 6:00 am but was surprised to see it was dark. So, I went over to the hotel front desk and asked when and where they serve breakfast ... the woman there said that the restaurant should be opening about now and I had gone to the right place. So, figuring I might be a couple of minutes early, I went back to the restaurant and waited for about 5 minutes when a gentleman came out from the kitchen and (looking at me like I was in the wrong place) said the cook was \"sick\" that morning and to come back at 7:00 am (which was too late for me ... I told him that, but he didn't seem to care, and offered not alternatives). An airport hotel doesn't have more than one cook (it's a major international airport, so people are coming and going at all times ... and leaving early to catch a flight should be expected ... but they don't have a back-up plan!). I was more than happy to leave and have breakfast at the airport while waiting for my fligh!

Although I could get a much lower corporate rate for Sheraton Gateway and The Westin LAX, yet I chose to stay at Four Points by Sheraton because I have never stayed in a Four Points by Sheraton hotel before and I wanted to experience it. It was a risk choosing the hotel since my stay duration was for 6 nights. My check-in was fast and done in less than 5 minutes, the front desk guy could consider putting on a smiling face though. After enduring a 31 hours flight, I didn't bother to take note of his name. I was given room no. 213, which is facing Airport Blvd. First impression upon entering the room is that it is the smallest room among all other Starwood hotels that I've stayed before. However, it's the least concern to me. Contrary to some comments on cleanliness of the room, mine was just fine although there were some stains on the wash basin but that was cleaned in the subsequent housekeeping routine. During my stay, one of the gym equipment was out of order, which was not fixed throughout my stay. I hope the equipment would be fixed soon. Throughout my stay, I have had the opportunity to seek help from staff at the guest service and each of them have been helpful. Since I rely on taxi to get around on some occasions, I have the staff at guest service to help me in arranging the transportation. I guess the only drawback in staying at LAX area is I have to pay a lot more to go to any place. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in Four Points by Sheraton.

A female behind the counter was laughing while watching him in action. We booked a night city tour through the hotel and asked about options for a ride to the port for our cruise the next day. The concierge said she would take care of it for us. She should have told us it was going to cost $70 bucks for the ride instead of us finding out when getting out of the car! After arriving back at the hotel following our honeymoon cruise, the concierge again offered poor advice when we asked about transportation options to Hollywood. She said it would not be easy for us without having a car and advised us to catch a shuttle from LAX. Terrible advice. Another $35 wasted and we had to walk several blocks to our destination and were left with no ride back to our hotel. After asking a tour guide we booked outside the hotel, he advised we take the train back to LAX and then the hotel shuttle. We could have spent $12 total! Avoid booking tours thru the hotel as well.

An hour later, I was still waiting for one so I called the front desk and when I inquired about the status of the fridge, the front desk said they would check the status (in a very annoyed tone) then hung up on me. Another hour passes and since there were no return calls, I called again and was told me that they were trying to track one down and that I could leave the room and when I returned from dinner, there would be one there. Returning from dinner, there was still no fridge. So I called and was finally connected to a manager who then told me that there were no more fridges available. So why promise to provide me with something that you don't have? So the next morning, I went to the front desk in person to speak to someone. My leftovers from lunch and dinner had spoiled and there were still no answers. When I explained this to the General Manager, he apologized and offered to take $40 off my room. Even though that would not excuse the mix up, it compensated what I lost in my left overs. I thought everything was fine. The next morning (check out morning) I received an express/automatic check out. My bill was sent to my room and it was itemized. Instead of the promised $40 off... he only took off $35. I would never stay at this hotel again. They can't seem to keep any of their promises. If I book a room and it was promised that I would get a room. When I show up... Will I really get a room?

I was then put into a room that should have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taken off market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd per the hotels GM the original issues with the room included a FILTHY, moldy gross tub, complete with hairy ceiling and walls, stained and buckled carpet, noisy door, and faulty HVAC. The GM contacted me apologetic and sent me a certificate for a 2 nights stay in a Jr. Suite for my troubles along with a reward card full of points that will allow me to stay at a discount at another hotel in the Starwood network. Long story short, months pass and I find myself traveling for business in LA again so I call over and over and over and over again trying to redeem my certificate. Left at least 5 voicemails and spoke to several different people in reservations who were unable to book the room. I should have cut my losses and kept it moving on to another hotel but apparently I am a glutton for punishment. I FINALLY find out after talking to at least 3 different people that the RESERVATIONS dept cant redeem the certificate it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the INTERNAL reservations dept that must do it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I left several more messages including one that just said here is my cert number, my name, date of my stay just book it for pete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and it was NOT booked. Finally I got in touch with someone in the internal reservations dept, book my room and they again apologized for the inconvenience. Fast fwd to my arrival date. The day prior I called to CONFIRM that I would be arriving late the next day and to ensure that my room would be held\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they assured me that it had been reserved. I arrived late after appointments in the city to an empty counter. I stood for 15+ minutes before someone arrived to go find the night auditor. The night auditor comes looks at my certificate and tells me that my room had been given away due to late checkin. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!! So I get a standard king room which should be nonsmoking but that smelled like an ashtray and was far away from being a SUITE and the MOMENT I fall asleep the FIRE ALARM goes off. I evacuate my room sleepy eyed and finally return to get some shut eye. Then the POWER goes out on one wall in the room. The wall of course with my charging cell phone and alarm clock so I overslept for my appointment the next morning. In the morning I go to the front desk to alert them of the power issue and they again apologize and move me to the suite I should have had in the first place. The suite I finally ended up in was newly remodeled and very nice, but what a fiasco. There are truly some systematic issues going on with the hotel, poor customer service on the phone, lack of personnel during late shifts, lack of communication and even in the new wing they find some sort of weird need to use old school STOPPERS for the tubs that are gross/discolored and outdated. Parking lot was full, rooms are poorly insulated so you can hear your neighbors making love, screaming babies and the whole shebang even in the new wing. On a positive note the pool looked inviting and the bed was comfy... avoid the restaurant with its $15 salads... that can easily be copped from a nearby McDonalds for 1/3 of the cost.

Another first impression might be the convenience of their location to your rental car: If you're driving, your rental car pick-up drop off is literally just across the street or around the corner. Their corporate rates now include free parking. Another first impression might be when you walk into their rennovated rooms to find a welcome change from the 1970's Partridge Family orange/browns of most \"budget\" hotels. As an SPG Platinum, I've gotten upgrades when they were available, and a sincere apology when these weren't (not that it's the hotel's fault their junior suites are sold out, but they do try), and I've always found a personalized thank you on a plate of cookies and grapes waiting on the coffee table. If you fancy a pint, their beer selection has more than enough choices. Their fitness centre is certainly better than most hotels in this class.

I almost forgot to mention the used band aid on the floor as well. There were no bathing towels in the room, nor was there any conditioner. Lastly, there was only decaf coffee in the room. I spoke to GIna, the manager, but unfortunately there were no more renovated rooms available. Problem is this was one of the reasons we chose this hotel. So, Gina offered to comp parking. This was nice but I would rather have had a nice room than free parking. She's working on getting me an additional night, at least, at no charge. I'll let everyone know what happens.

The room had a stink that made you want to heave when you walk in, there were holes in the walls, carpets in hallway and rooms were stained. The blinds were covered in dirt and pen marks, The internet was so slow that you used up the 15 minutes free time just trying to log on. The pillows were like rocks,and you could hear everything that was going on in the room next door. Table leg broken on the desk so we had to prop it up and tv had very poor reception on only a couple of stations. The kids room was just as bad. Spoke to several people in the lifts and foyer who said similar things and no one would go back. If you want poor quality, expensive for what you got, but close to the airpiort stay there but there are so many others in the area try them first. We had a another night in the radisson - cheap and much better!!!!", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cQuality of stay depends on the room you're in\u201d", "Author": "TerryWrist", "ReviewID": "UR95877995", "Content": "Had two stays here within two weeks.

The room came with a fridge to store milk and groceries, if you wish.

Even surfing through web-pages was a challenge. I tried upstairs, lobby, netbook, and iPod touch -- all devices were a challenge to get service (though the lobby was slightly better). A pet peeve of mine is hotels that rely on wi-fi only for their Internet connection -- I'm willing to pay extra for a wired Ethernet connection, but if there's none available, the Wi-Fi had better be solid.

I was able to return my rental car and walk across the street to this hotel for a good night's sleep before my morning flight out.

One thing that's a bit different is the windows look out onto a hallway which has exterior windows on the other side of the hall, rather than looking straight outside like normal windows. I worried a bit that foot traffic past the room would wake me up during the night, but it didn't. The folks at the front desk were extremely nice and very accommodating for check-in... a welcome touch after a long drive on California's freeways. While I was checking in, a group of about ten international flight attendants came in... this is obviously a busy airport hotel. There's a convenient (albeit a bit confusing) kiosk in the lobby where I was able to print out my boarding pass for the next day, and there's a Burger King across the street for fast food devotees. Complimentary wireless internet is available (thank you), but the signal is fairly weak (ranges from poor to good) so service is s-l-o-w. Apparently you can get faster service for a fee. Throughout the hotel staff are exceptionally nice... unusually so. Good hot breakfast buffet was included in price of my room... eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc. One pet peeve - the room bill was not left under the door at night so had to check out at front desk... waste of my time, especially since there was a bit of a hold-up at the front desk. Nice convenient shuttle service to LAX. I liked the idea of staying here on my last night of a trip to Los Angeles so I could turn in my rental car the night before departure, and have a relatively stress free trip to the airport... you'll need it once you get to LAX!!!

And while we're on the subject of the bathroom, it was barely larger than a coat closet and so uncomfortably small that my legs were knocking against the door and the bathtub when I had to use the toilet. (Too much info? MAYBE, but in case you want to know if you'll be comfortable, you most likely won't be in the bathroom.) I also didn't make a big deal of the fact that the pool had no water in it. Why bother? There is a whole entire ocean a couple blocks away. Personally, I think some of my disappointment comes from the fact that I read about the hotel on Trip Advisor and I knew that some of the rooms were being updated/remodeled. So I asked for an updated room, which the desk guy was really nice about giving me. But...if the one I got was an UPDATED one, I'd hate to see what the NON-updated ones looked like. The decor was like staying at someone's aunt's house who hadn't redecorated in years, and who also has bad taste. The comforter on my bed had a small stain, which was somewhat distasteful, but the sheets were always fresh and clean each day. The lobby is gorgeous and looks really high end, which is why it was surprising that the room was so motel-ish. Another point about the \"remodeled\" room that we were in...the rust on the door hinges in the bathroom was clearly obvious despite having a fresh coat of paint over it. The hallway carpet also had a big stain on it (stayed on the 5th floor). I don't know. Overall, it was decent, but the lobby made me expect something really nice, and the actual rest of the hotel was really not living up to that expectation. Staff was really nice and helpful.

It was about $25-50 bucks cheaper than the surrounding hotels. I was excited that we were going to be staying at a Sheraton. When we arrived, the lobby was very nice, and the service at check-in was very pleasant. The front desk mgr checked us in, and told us that we would be in one of the renovated rooms. When the elevator arrived at the 5th floor, we were confused at where to go. Yes, there were arrows pointing to the numbered rooms, but they all pointed to exit doors that looked like stairwells. When we ventured through ours, we walked down a long, musty, smelly hall (not to mention the pot smell coming from one of the rooms). It was like a motel, large glass windows with pull down shades in each of the rooms, that you could look into as you walked by. There were no windows to the outside, other than across the hall. Once in the room, the furnishings were nice, (but the room was small). Not much room to move around if you had luggage. There were four of us, two adults and two teenage boys, each w/one suitcase and a backpack. Large flat screen tv, nice linens, nice wallpaper, nice desks (two), a single cup coffee maker & free wi-fi. The weird thing was the carpet. It was really old looking, but very clean looking (but didn't match).The bedding was nice and the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom sported new, modern fixtures. I'm glad we got one of the renovated rooms! This was NOT up to the standard of a Sheraton, and I am very surprised that they have allowed their brand to be associated with it. We also went to the restaurant, which, much to our relief was open until 1am. (We arrived after 10pm, starving!) The waiter kind of messed up our order, but he was quick to fix it and the food was delicious. The guest services desk was very helpful in holding our bags at no charge until for a few hours until we left to catch our next flight. The pool was 'under renovation' due to an 'emergency issue' according to the front desk, but they quickly advised that we would be able to access the pool at the Renaissance Hotel next door, as long as we showed them the Four Points business card. What was attractive was the free shuttle to/from the airport every twenty minutes. Overall, it was a place to sleep, but I would NOT be comfortable staying there had I been traveling alone.

Here are the details, the room was extremely outdated. The hallway in front of my room had buckled and sticky carpet. In the room was an old oak headboard, a filthy outdated bathtub with stained tiles, a waterstained and hairy stopper for the bathtub (YES I SAID A STOPPER!! OMG) and moldy caulking, hair stuck to the shower walls and ceiling, and the AC unit was EXTREMELY noisy cutting on and off throughout the night and waking me up with rattling noise. The bed was comfortable enough and the bedding clean and welcoming. I was told that the hotel was sold out so they were unable to move me to another room, so I took the stinking \"breakfast credit\" for my inconvenience. The breakfast was tasty once they bothered to refill the buffet (which took about 30 minutes of waiting). The staff however in the caf\u00c3\u00a9 was extremely courteous and friendly, I did enjoy dining there and that was the highlight of my stay once everything was refilled. The room I was in (RM 366) according to the front desk should have been \"taken off the market\" but was put back on market apparently since the hotel was overbooked due to cancelled flights etc. The Entry way, lobby, restaurant and pool areas all looked newly remodeled and were gorgeous so at first sight I was impressed with the hotel. The hotel rooms are under construction so it appears I just happened to get a very outdated crappy and FILTHY room. I was VERY dissapointed! Although it was tasty, the breakfast didn't come close to making up for my crappy room... I have literally seen better rooms at a Motel 6! Now IT GETS BETTER... when I contacted the hotel for a refund, the answer was no but we will give you a complimentary 2 nights stay in a suite... sounds like a good deal right? NO, it took me reminding the Assistant GM 3 times to finally get the thing in the mail and her cover letter said the cert was only for a 1 nights stay. I was a bit alarmed so then read the cert, which then said 2 nights stay. However, before I could feel releived I read on and discovered that her letter was dated June 30th, 2010 and that the certificate EXPIRED June 29th, 2010. Granted I live in Indiana and don't own a time machine so how the heck am I supposed to use it? Not to mention the countless spelling and grammar errors found in the cover letter and on the certificate. I am like YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!!

For budgetary reasons and because I was working at a client site close by, we couldn't move but we definitely would have. HW gave this property 3 stars with 70% recommended, so we gave the FP a shot. Bad move... To save you the headache we had from staying here: don't ever consider staying at the Four Points LAX, unless you really have to. What we liked: (a) staff was generally helpful; (b) Hotel has 24 shuttle service to the airport; (c) comfortable seats in the lobby; (d) nice looking furnishings and accessories in the renovated wing. What we didn't like: (1) overall feeling of grime and dirt throughout the hotel, in the renovated lobby, the hallways, though not quite the rooms and most of all in the non-renovated wings; (2) noise from adjacent rooms carried forth into our room, from footsteps to what you will read further down; (3) wireless internet connection only worked in the lobby; (4) hotel management put us in the middle of a large family with unruly children and all-night partying adults, severely disturbing our sleep, and couldn't care less. Pictures try to show how dirty the hotel is, but in case it doesn't come over, imagine that none of the sofas in the lobby every get cleaned, everything has black and other color spots, the carpeting has stains in the newly renovated areas, that should give you a good idea. When we arrived we were assigned to a room in one of the old wings. The musty, mold smell in the hallways was too much for us, the room itself was barely any better. Since a previous reviewer here had alerted us about the renovations we had already asked reception for a room in that renovated wing, but the check in person (Trish) flatly stated that a \"large convention just took all our rooms, we are sold out.\" Not satisfied with the first room, we went back to the front desk. They gave us another room on a higher floor. Also non-renovated. Same complaint about musty, allergy causing smell. Third try: Trish had gone on a break, so we get a room in the renovated wing. These rooms have NO OUTSIDE WINDOWS! If this is a problem for you, wait until they have renovated the rest of the hotel. What this means is that other guests can walk by your room and look at what you're doing...if you don't close the blinds shut. There are carpet stains throughout the property. In the old rooms, in the hallways, everywhere. Also in the newly renovated rooms. So we asked to see another room hoping it might be cleaner. On to room 4 we went. No luck there either, still the renovated wing but on a higher floor, same dirty carpet and now also a bad smell in the room. So we asked for room 3 back and got it, but before we moved in we had to ask housekeeping to clean the tortilla and cookie crumbs off the floor everywhere in the room. Then the real trouble started. Unbeknownst to us, a large family had been assigned to our floor (so much for large conventions, Trish!). Airport hotels get guests coming and going all day and night so one would expect hotels to be more or less solidly built. Not so the Four Points. You can hear everything except regular conversation, regular sound level TV noise and water flowing. So if everyone just opened and closed their room door in a normal fashion and kept conversation civilized, you would not notice your neighbors. We weren't so lucky, so we called security when our neighbors kept slamming the doors, frequently coming and going, after 10:30 at night. Security managed to keep things quiet for about 30 minutes, then the kids in room 352 started jumping around again and the adults in 348 started visiting other parts of the family down the hall, and returning to their room every 15 minutes or so. Called security again, same result. The next night the same story, except that now at 4:30 in the morning I was awakened by a slamming door. At checkout I filled out a security report. Not once did the hotel management offer us any kind of compensation. Not once did they offer to relocate us to another room. Thank you Four Points, but no thanks. If you do end up here, don't be surprised if the Free Wireless Internet doesn't work in your room. We had the hotel's help desk and IT departments work on it for two days and they couldn't get it to work. In the lobby it works fine, but try having a Skype conversation and you're out of luck. About food, skip the breakfast. Not worth your $14 plus tax and tip. Oh, and there are no refrigerators in the renovated rooms. Oh, and yes, you do have to pay for parking: $16. And the coffee bar is only open until 10am.

I travel on business a lot so I have a great deal of experience with hotel around the world. I always stay at the Four Points LAX when I am down in the LA area. It is clean comfortable and close to the Freeways to get to where you want to go. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it; you have to drive to where you want to go in LA. This time I had not stayed at the Four Points LAX for about a year. I arrived without a reservation and approached the front desk agent. I remembered him from pervious stays. Now here is the incredible part, with the thousands of guests that they see every week he also remembered me. Not just that but he remembered my favorite room. Wow! After a 500 mile drive I was tired and did not want to go anywhere so I went down to the hotel bar to get something to eat. The waiter also remembered me and brought me my favorite Germen beer. On a side note the hotel bar, Brewster's servers an incredibly large selection of beers from around the world. Ask for the beer menu, it is broken down by country of origin. The restaurant is currently being renovated but you can still get anything off the restaurant menu in the bar. The food is very good with large portions that could easily feed two. What makes this hotel stand out is the incredible staff. I often travel to LA on business and to visit relatives. Over the years I stayed at many of the hotels around LAX (and there are a lot of them). They are all about the same, as far as room size and amenities go. The Four Points by Sheraton LAX sets it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self apart by providing excellent value for your money and an absolutely incredible staff. The entire hotel staff display a true Aloha spirit. Every staff member that I came across, from maintenance worker, to house keeper, to concierge, to desk agent all greeted me with a smile and salutation. What I look for in a hotel is clean, comfortable and affordable in that order. The Four Points Sheraton LAX has all of that and a friendly staff. They have all of the amenities that you could want including a welcoming pool, room service and free in-room wireless Internet. If you are looking for a great value for your money this is the right place to stay. It is my only hotel in LA. Thank you Four Points LAX for taking care of me again.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cGood value near LAX\u201d", "Author": "Traveller20203", "ReviewID": "UR68132516", "Content": "On the last night of a business trip to LA, we stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton LAX.

Since her company paid for the hotel room during the class, for the first night we were there we had to make a separate reservation. Our flight from Honolulu arrived in LA at about 5:00 a.m. and even though we knew that maybe our room was not ready, we decided to try and check in. When we first arrived at the hotel, it was difficult trying to find a parking space in the \"check in\" parking spot. Even though there was a sign that said \"10 Minute Reserved Parking Space to Check In\", we found out no one really monitors this. We ended up parking in the \"No Parking Area\". When we went to the registration, the staff member greeting was okay. I understand it was very early, but try to have a little enthusiasm. The staff member said at the earliest a room would be available is 7:00 a.m. My wife and I left, ate breakfast, and came back at about 8:00 a.m. When we came back, a different staff member checked us in. At first he said the room was not ready, but for some reason he was able to get us a room. We were very happy until we got to the room. To get to some of the rooms at Four Points, once you get off the elevator, you have to go through a separate door that leads you to another part of the hotel. This room was located in this other section and when we entered the room, it was one of the smallest rooms I have ever been in. Even the cruise ships have bigger rooms. Since the room did not have a refrigerator and my wife needs one for her medication, we called for one. The refrigerator they brought up was one of the dorm -sized refrigerator and the only place to put the refrigerator was in back of the front door. This means that since the door opened into the room, it would always hit the refrigerator. In addition, the bathtub faucet was coming off, so everytime we pulled the lever to turn on the shower, the faucet seemed it was going to come off the wall. As for the noise, I'm not sure if we were tired from the red eye flight, but we could not hear the noise from the aircraft, even though the planes fly right above the hotel. The next day, my wife checked in and we got a different room. This time the room was located in the main building and it was much bigger. In fact the refrigerator could fit almost anyplace in the room. As for the location, there isn't much within walking distance. For eating places, there is a Burger King, but that's about it. Good thing we had a car to drive to various places. The hotel does have two laptop computers to use if you need to use the internet. The laptops are located in the lobby area, right across the front desk and it is locked to the desk. This was very convenient especially if you do not bring a computer. If we had to stay in the first room, I would never go back to the Four Points. But since the second room was a bigger improvement, I would consider staying there again.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cOnly to spend the night before early flight\u201d", "Author": "Pepetito", "ReviewID": "UR53994429", "Content": "Book it if you need to wake up early to catch a morning flight from LAX and if you find some promo rate like I did ($75).

The tub and shower were pretty nasty with soap scum as other posters have mentioned. The toilet kept running unless you worked it just right to make sure you had the tank flap positioned properly. The thermostat said it was 63 in the room and if you turned the temperature up to make it warmer it just poured more cold air into the room, so I turned on all the lights and the tv to try to get some heat in the room.

At the back of the hotel there is a tower block where, I understand, the rooms have not been refurbished. they are also smaller rooms and lack amenities such as a refrigerator and may have older TVs and beds. The elevators can be very slow. Our experience is that there are often good package deals available which can include parking and buffet breakfast all for $115. Otherwise, If you have a car, it can cost $16 a day extra without such a deal. The buffet breakfast ('Full American\") is a good deal at about $10 for two people within a package but $20 per person without. It usually compares favourably on price with all LAX hotels, especially on weekdays. Weekend rates elsewhere vary from $80 upwards with $150 a day upwards on weekdays - Four Points 'pay in advance' non-refundable is often less than $100 on weekdays and much lower at weekends. Sheraton Four Points, Hilton, Renaissance and Westin are all significantly more expensive and poorer value except at weekends -which vary widely depending on events. Priceline often has very cheap room-only deals at Westin, Renaissance and SAS - bid on 4 star and you may be as lucky as $75 plus the Priceline fee.

But let me tell you straight: this hotel is just plain terrible. We stayed there twice, and both were terrible experience. To be objective, the room cleanliness was great. i liked the free internet. But the room facility control is poor, I can say. I was once very tired after my trip, just to find that the bathtub faucet wasn't working, and it took a hell while for them to put me in another room. Also, there is something about the front desk and restaurant staffs. The control over them, I may say, is so poor. Say, wouldn't you be disturbed when you are having lunch in a restaurant, and the janitor decided it's time to vacuum clean the restaurant carpet?? Or, in what kind of hospitality training did the waiters join, that they casually LET THE PLATE FALLS DOWN onto the table from their hand (literally) when they serve our orders, or sarcastically commenting in a rude way when my father asked for the water to be replaced with one in a room temperature? Now, the front desk staffs were even ruder. Not all of them, though. Some are very polite, and some of them, wow, WHO WAS THE GUEST THERE?? We have this young woman taking care of our bills when we were checking out, and she kept on saying that we are billed for two rooms when we were only stayed in one. No matter how patiently I explained it to her over and over again, she persisted that we are to pay for the phone bills for the other room we didn't even step our feet in! \"Sir, you booked this room through tripadvisor under your name, and you use the phone, so you gotta pay for it,\" she said while waving the bill paper in front of me. That was just enough to get me pissed finally. It wasn't even my name on that bill. \"You gave this bill paper to me earlier, so?\". She kept on saying afterwards that I myself brought the bill to her 5 minutes ago when I said we were going to check out, when I did not bring any paper with me to the front desk. After minutes of arguing this so simple of a matter, with me keep pointing out that that was TWO DIFFERENT names on the bill (how simple is that?), she finally just said \"Well, ok, Sir, you know, maybe you forgot it\". Oh my goodness. This is just plain silly. I have never, in my life, disregarded that much in any hotel in the world, particularly, in ANY Starwood hotels!

And yes, the neighbours were up and watching sports, some match or something and guess what happens if you put a few match loving men in a room in the middle of the night without supervision?! sure they make noise which also is normal, but it kept me awake the whole night and having a flight very early in the morning, that was exactly what I didn't need.

Driver was kind enough to \"turn off the bus's tracking system,\" go off his approved route, and drop me at Four Points. He said it wasn't a really safe place to walk and he was right--it wasn't a BAD neighborhood, but it was poorly lit and consisted of mainly alleys and backs of hotels or hotel parking garages with no pedestrians whatsoever. Check in at midnight was pretty seamless and fast. Hall directions out of elevator were totally misleading. I didn't expect there to be no exterior windows--your window faced out into the hallway, which had windows, so the room got some natural light. The room was as I expected, and identical to website and orbitz photos. Room was clean, and I liked the simple updated style (nice big flat-screen). Bed and linens were clean and bright white, good feather pillows too--I slept well. I got coffee, banana, and yogurt at the coffee bar (not complimentary--I think it cost me about $7). The solarium-type, large lounge was bright, spacious, and generously furnished with several t.v.'s and laptop ports. I told the concierge I needed a cab, and I was in a hurry. He told me it would be about 10 minutes (this surprised me because we were spitting-distance from the airport, and I expected them to be plentiful). He told me to \"sit right there\" on a specific couch--which I also thought was odd. I got antsy and walked outside for some fresh air. 8 feet from the door was a line of cabs--and I hopped in the first one which pulled right up the moment I came out. Obviously, the concierge wanted a friend to have the business (my driver agreed with this theory).

There is plenty of lighting and space to work if you are on business.

The tv gets a lot of channels, including HBO. The bathroom has lovely Evelyn & Crabtree toiletries and soft fluffy towels. The shower is wonderful, it has plenty of hot water and a strong flow of water. There is actually a wire tray at eye level for your toiletries too! The shower rod is bowed out so the curtain does not cling to you. Overall I was very happy with the room, though it was small, but had everything you could want for comfort. It was also very \"mod\" in appearance and style. We did go down to the bar/lounge at their advertised \"happy hour\" time but they had no specials for food or drink! The drinks were not cheap and they were not strong. The food was so-so and expensive ($14 for a club sandwich). We did not understand advertising a \"happy hour\" if there were no specials. The service in the bar/lounge was slow and not too excited to help you. This was the only downer part of our stay here. I did use the free computers (2) with internet downstairs to check our flights and that was a very nice feature. They let you use it as long as you like, but if others are waiting they ask you to limit your use to 15 minutes. It was very handy. Oh yeah, there is a liquor/convenience store only one block away from the hotel but you have to know which way to go as you cannot see it from the street. If you walk outside the hotel and look to the left there is an intersection with light. Cross the street toward the airport and walk straight and you'll find the store. Overall I would stay here again, especially for a park and fly deal.

We stayed here for two nights prior to sailing on Carnival Cruise Lines and to do some sight seeing in Los Angeles prior to our cruise. We arrived right at check in time and were greeted by a friendly front desk clerk. We were checked in very quickly. In fact, all of the staff we encountered were friendly. A room was nice, modern, clean and well maintained. At first, I thought we had no bathroom. The door to that is to left of the main door but the bathroom is tucked away behind the closet wall. This is an interesting and great feature as it gives you a bit more room to move around. The bathroom itself was a bit small but at least was clean. The tiles on the walls and in the shower were showing some wear and tear and needed to be replaced. Someone tried that in the shower and used the wrong tint of white so it showed badly. Our bed was fine as they are always are at a Sheraton and the television was nice and big. The room was kept spotless by housekeeping. The lobby area can be very loud and crowded at times. This is due to very busy times with check-in, airline crews coming and going and the hotel also a popular place for meetings and parties. The food here is just average but there is not a whole lot to choose from in the area. The hotel itself has a restaurant where we had the breakfast buffet twice. It was your standard fare but not much to choose from and definitely not worth the $30 they charged us. There is a bar serving all kinds of beers from all over the world. This is actually quite good. You can also get food here as well as they have the same menu as the restaurant. Again, it was pricey and the quality just average. There is a Burger King across the street and we found a steak house in the Marriott across the street. That was fine but even more expensive than what the Sheraton had to offer. Since most people only stay here or night or maybe two, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll survive. There is a pool here which was fine. Although, it was smaller than the picture shown on their website! It was clean and not too crowded. They also keep the water quite warm so you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t freeze when you get in. There is also a fitness adjacent to the pool which is well equipped but in a small room. We only took the free shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel. This took a while to show up. When it did, we discovered that one bus serves three different hotels. It was fine as we did make it to the Sheraton which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that far away. If taking this to the airport, give yourself extra time as we saw a few instances of passengers being forced to wait for the next shuttle as the one that showed up was full. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also not painted in Sheraton colors like other buses you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find at other airports. The bus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 destination sign in front will tell you what hotels that it stops at. Make sure you get on the right bus! If you are looking to do some sightseeing, take Sightseeing LA which provides bus tours. They will pick you up here and then bring you back. You can make reservations yourself or the hotel can arrange it for you. We took a full day tour and they are really great. Also, if you are going on a cruise like we did, here are a few pointers for getting to your ship. If you sail on a weekday, give yourself plenty of time due to traffic. We left on a Sunday so the traffic was light. Have the hotel book you a car to take you to your ship. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same price as a regular taxi but more reliable and comfortable. The cruise ports (there are two in LA) are about a 40 minute ride from here with no traffic. Overall, not a bad place to spend a night or two.

When I was checking out I settled the respective bill with cash (approximately $75), rather than having it charged to the credit card I have registered upon check-in. Before flying back to the uk I decided to take a few days in Las Vegas, where I stayed at the Hilton. I was initially alerted that there was an issue when I checked into the Las Vegas Hilton. The same card I had used in Los Angeles was 'rejected' as payment for the room. I immediately contacted my credit card company in the uk, who informed me that a charge of $750 had been made to the card by the Sheraton Four Points Hotel at LAX. This almost wiped out the remaining credit on the card, and as I did not have any other credit cards I was forced to use the limited cash I had on me, as a consequence I did not have the greatest two days in the city. I was unable to rent a car as had planned to do, plus I was also restricted to eating 'budget' food. After two days a security supervisor from the credit card company called to inform me that they had been in direct contact with the Four Points Hotel, and the customer services manager had confirmed that a desk clerk had been fired as a consequence of a number of thefts. When visitors settled their hotel accounts in cash (as I did) the offending desk clerk would simply charge the amount to the registered credit card, then pocket the cash ($750 in my case) When I reported the matter to the hotel they did not even apologise. However, after a number of letters and emails to the Starwood HQ they agreed that they would provide me with some level of 'compensation' which was in the form of either a free stay, or at least vouchers. It will shortly be the FOURTH anniversary of the stay and I have still not received any vouchers, or indeed any physical confirmation that I would be provided with a free stay upon my next trip to the United States. The reason this matter came to mind again is because I am flying out to Los Angeles later this month and I would like Starwood to provide me with what they promised. I have sent them two letters over the last few weeks but they have failed to respond to any of them. To say I am disappointed with the outcome of this matter would be an understatement. Not only was I the victim of theft, but the premeditated criminal actions of a Starwood Hotels employee robbed me of a relaxing stay in Las Vegas, and a trip to the Grand Canyon, which I had always dreamed of. Needless to say, I shall never stay with any of their hotels ever again, and I would like to warn all visitors of the possibility of becoming a victim of theft whenever you stay with Starwood Hotels.

They made our two and a half days full of great things....arranging transportation to Santa Monica pier, arranging shuttles for us to Disneyland, printed out maps for us, confirmed reservations for us, and even went so far as to drive us themselves to a wonderful Mexican restaurant called Paco Taco's because they had so highly recommended it and wanted to save us the cab fare. Now that's impressive!! Check in was smooth and quick, we had two rooms booked on both nights as we were travelling with my motherinlaw. Rooms were great, large, clean, comfy, bright and modern. Lovely bedding. Airport shuttle was fast and easy picking us up at the airport and taking us back to the airport. Very friendly shuttle service. Close to many amenities, including some restaurants and very close to an easy to follow bus station. Cabs easy to find too. Super quick internet room always available. Friendly service in their very nice gift shop. Our only complaint was the restaurant. Service was by far the worst we have ever encountered, and we eat out in nice restaurants a lot. Food was mediocre. Service staff was so slow and incompetent, it was almost laughable. Skip the hotel's restaurant and have them take you to Paco Taco's or another restaurant.

You can even view your account balance, charges and check out of the room on the TV.

The shrimp scampy dinner was probably the best we have had and is highly recommended. The staff at the restaurant were very friendly as they always seem to be in LA. Stay away from the VIP Star tours and get one of the independent tours. The VIP tours are inexpensive but they have so many people in the tour you get stuck on a set schedule. They pretty much flyby everything so taking pictures is almost impossible. Independent tours have way more flexibility in what you want to see and how long you stay at the sights although they cost more. It's the old saying, you get what you pay for. If you get to Universal Studios take the VIP tour. This is one step up from the Front Of The Line pass but I have been on this twice and it is the best there is. Sure it's $150 US but you get a dedicated guide, walk on and in the sets and get in front of the Front Of The Line people. :) Well worth it.

When we checked in, they couldn\u00c2\u00b4t find our reservation at first, but after a call and a walk to the back office by the front disk girl, they checked us in. Traveling as a couple, we asked for a king non-smoking room and she didn\u00c2\u00b4t objected. When we arrived at our floor we had troubles to find the room. We had to walk through a door that looked more like a door to (emergency) staircase than to the hallway to some guest rooms (see the picture). When we walked through that door it did not get any better. This is motel, was our first thought. The room doors and the painting looked worn. When we entered our room we had to find out that they gave us a two queen room which we found unacceptable. I called the front desk and they sad the our travel agency booked a two queen and that they are completely booked. There would be no possibility to switch rooms. I don\u00c2\u00b4t believe that my agency booked this kind of room. They booked other hotels for this trip and they were all king rooms. Also they knew that we were having a vacation as a couple. I think it\u00c2\u00b4s just the people from the Sheraton trying to fill there hotel and trying to get rid of the complaint. The room looks a bit bleak. Though it\u00c2\u00b4s a motel-like arrangement there is the door with a window on the one side. The bathroom on the opposite sdte is not such a nice view.

I think we were a bit lucky that we got a room overlooking the pool and not the back parking lot. Speaking of the bathroom, i didn\u00c2\u00b4t expect to have a rusty AC intake in a Sheraton property. The AC can be adjusted but proofed not to be efficient during our stay.

Another hidden cost was the $10 per night charge for parking ($20 for non-guests, and a bit more for valet services). We did not try the restaurant or boutique beer bar, but they appeared fine. There is a large swimming pool which we did not use, but others appeared to enjoy sitting next to, and a quite modest gift shop (more a souvenir shop).

The restaurant and location make it worth the stay for an airport overniter.", "Date": "January 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTerrible room\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3001491", "Content": "Stayed here on Dec. 31, 2004. I was looking for a hotel close to the airport since we were getting in late on the 31st, and I planned to pick up my rental car on the 1st. I figured a Sheraton should be a good bet, but I was definitely wrong. The hotel is certainly close to LAX (less than a mile) and the free shuttle and 24 hour check in was helpful, since we got in from Boston at 10:30 PM LA time. The lobby was spacious and very nice, and the staff was extremely friendly and seemed to genuinely try to go out of their way to be helpful. Once I got off the elevator on the floor for my room, however, my experience took a sharp turn for the worse. Although the lobby is totally enclosed, the rooms are reached from balconies that circle the outside of the building, which greatly increases the noise level. The room itself was filthy and shabby, and smelled of stale smoke and Lysol. There were hairs on the (dirty) floor of the bathroom, a dirty ashtray was sitting on the desk (we had asked for a non-smoking room) and the air conditioner/heater didn't work, so we spent the night in a dirty, smelly, and stuffy room. If it weren't for the fact that I had just gotten off of a six and a half hour flight from Boston, and had been up for nearly 24 hours straight, I would have left immediately and found another place to stay. When I checked out the next morning I cancelled my reservation for the following week (I originally planned to stay there on the way back, as well). The desk clerk didn't seem surprised when I told him the room was not up to my standards for cleanliness and appearance, but he was polite, and did ask if I had filled out a feedback questionnaire (I had). Sheraton should be ashamed to have their name associated with this property.", "Date": "January 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cA bad introduction to the US\u201d", "Author": "KathrynSimon", "ReviewID": "UR2444138", "Content": "Myself, my husband and myself stayed here for one night on our arrival in the US.

For some inexplicable reason, a gentleman from housekeeping decided to bring fresh towels to several of the rooms on our floor at midnight. We already had plenty of clean towels and didn't much appreciate being woken up. The public areas are very pleasant and clean, but the corridors are rather shabby & could do with a bit of sprucing up. On the plus side, we had a lovely dinner in the restaurant at the hotel, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Also, the driver of the shuttle bus to the airport kindly offered to take us directly to our car hire company, saving us some time.", "Date": "August 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oldeholtpade, The Netherlands (EU)", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price, Perfect Hotel, Good Room\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2443525", "Content": "The start And the finish of our three weeks vacation in US CA at Four Points was both times perfect.

When I called back and asked where the heck the shuttle was, the operator got upset with me because *I* was giving him attitude. When I finally got to the hotel, I had to wait in a line for 25 minutes. They checked me in, and when I opened the door to my room, there was some guy showering in there.

Nice lobby with wifi available. In the room, clean furniture, sparkling but small bathroom, room decor is average but fine, mattress was comfy, but there was no fridge which I could have used and the window was restricted from opening more than 2 inches. The staff was friendly, competent and accomodating. They changed my reservation to a 24-hour check-out (which I had forgotten to mention I needed when booking) at an even lower rate than I had seen on the net. I had a room on the second floor facing the front of the hotel so I could get the Wi-fi access typically available only in the lobby in my room - A PLUS for me. If you stay in the back part of the hotel you won't be impressed with the views AT ALL ... but if you face west - ie the front of the hotel ... well, you're at the airport and you can see the planes if that's your fancy. I wasn't bothered by noise from either neighboring room which was good as I hate that ... Room service ran about 45 min. for delivery. I didn't visit or use any of the restaurants, the pool, the gym, etc. but stopped in at the gift shop which had a relatively comprehensive selection of toiletries and snacks at high prices which is typical. The single draw back for me was the parking as others have mentioned. I either had to follow someone walking to their car to grab their space when they left or circle the entire lot to find the last remaining spot.
