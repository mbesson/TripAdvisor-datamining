She had been found twelve hours later by a friend. We made reservations at the Hampton Inn Crosstown, which is across the street from the hospital and we could walk between the two early in the morning or later at night after visitor hours were over. Although there are a group of homeless people occasionally, there are also many young student doctors walking the streets to and from the medical center. I believe a homeless shelter is nearby. We were never bothered by any of the homeless people either. There is a CVS pharmacy up two blocks from the hotel's parking area to the north, so this was convenient for snacks and medical needs. The best thing about this hotel was that the manager is sensitive to the needs of its guests who have family members staying at the hospital with life-threatening illnesses. He offered dinners to the hotel guests, as well as the hotel having the policy of including free hot breakfasts that were the best I've ever had at a Hampton Inn or other hotel of the same category. There was always hot chocolate, coffee, tea, and warm chocolate chip cookies to soothe our weary bodies after a particularly rough day at the hospital. These little touches meant the world to us. We are so very appreciative of this hotel manager offering its guests a hot meal in the evenings. I loved the themes, too. One night it would be Chinese food, the next night, Mexican fare, or Italian goodies. We looked forward to the meals each night before hurrying off back to the hospital. We also got the medical group rate since we were there because our daughter was in the hospital. The rooms were spacious and the beds were comfy, although the pillows were a tad too firm for me. I never had trouble sleeping despite the pain in my heart over what happened to our daughter. The bathrooms were also well equipped and very clean. The front desk staff were very accommodating when we had to extend our stay several times while our daughter recovered in the hospital. The front lobby is bright and spacious, and there is an airport shuttle that is quite expedient. Just call them and despite traffic, they are there quick because they use a special road for shuttles to avoid the notorious traffic at rush hour. There is a newly remodeled computer room and two elevators that actually work. The only drawback at staying close to any hospital is that you may hear ambulance sirens in the middle of the night occasionally. But with a sound conditioner or earplugs, plus the sound of the room heater, it's less noticeable. Would we stay there again if needed? You bet!

I didn't see them approach pedestrians. Boston is a large city. Caution should always be used in any large city after dark. The ambulance sirens and traffic noises didn't bother me but that's me.

We asked the person at the front desk for a nearby place to eat and have a drink or two. She sent us \"just a short walk down the street\". Not being familiar with the area we set out on foot. There were four of us, another couple, my wife, and me. We walked about 6 of the most dangerous blocks I've ever walked and I've been to more third-world countries than I care to remember. Numerous shady looking characters crossed our path or slowed down as they drove past us. It wouldn't have been so bad if we had not been assured by the person at the front desk that the area was safe, we had read some of the other reviews beforehand. I don't know what kind of neighborhood she (the person at the front desk) grew up in or lives in now, but I don't consider the neighborhood she sent us to as being safe at all. When we got to the establishment we couldn't get waited on so we left. It was very embarrassing to my wife and me as our friends are from overseas and this was their first trip to Boston.

This is from their website - \"We offer an extensive shuttle service at the Boston Hampton Crosstown Center, and opportunity for you to save on cab fare and parking fees.\" We booked here because of that statement on their website. It is also in their room information book. Not so - this service stopped January 1, 2011. The shuttle, we were told, only runs to and from the airport. When we were ready to check out, I went downstairs to, as instructed in the hotel information book, to \"reserve\" our seats on the next shuttle. When asked if I could reserve two seats on the next shuttle I was told \"just come down at 10 minutes before the hour\". This is not the service and attitude we have come to expect from Hampton Inn & Suites. Please refer to our review of the HI&S at Plymouth, MA. Now THAT's how you run a hotel.

It is around a $10 taxi ride from hotel to Fenway park, and $10 from hotel to the Aquarium, or the pond where the Swan boats are, so not too bad. Rooms where clean, tub is very small and had black mildew/mold around some of the caulking!! Free Internet. If you like Ambulance sirens, this is the place for you!! There were long stretches of no sirens, so it wasn't constant, but there were times it became a bit annoying, but I did sleep fine. Parking is $25 a night. Staff are very friendly. Free breakfast consisted of bagels/bread/danishes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, sausages, scrambled eggs, juices, coffee, and they had 1 waffle maker. There is a Dunkin Donuts just across the street, 10 second walk!!! Would I stay here again? If I wanted to be near the hospital, sure, but as a tourist no. I say No because of the infrequent shuttle times and it fills up fast. Another item that sort of ticked us off, was that our room entry cards were constantly becoming non-magnetized, so door would not open and had to go back to the front desk. Have never had this problem before, staff insisted it was because we must have come in contcat with magnets?????", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nazareth, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNewer Hotel - Decent Neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "ScottfromLV", "ReviewID": "UR73578306", "Content": "Spent one night here in Late July 2010.

Good parking set up as well for a city based hotel, with the deck right across the street and no valet to bother with.

So it's time to consume my frequent traveler's points for FREE vacations. I researched all four chains at Boston for my family vacation: Marriott (Marriott near Boston Harbor, Residence Inn, Courtyard at Tufts Medical Center, etc), Starwood (Sheraton, Westin, W, Four Point at the airport, etc), Hilton (Hilton at financial district, DoubleTree at Tufts Medical center, embassy Suite, 3 of the Hampton Inns, etc), and Hyatt (at the airport). This Hampton Inn offered the best value for my needs. One of the reasons I chose this hotel is that the General Manager Philip Tucker interacted on this TripAdvisor site. So I exchanged emails with him and decided to give it a shot. Pros (clean and best of value): 1. Hand-on friendly management staff (Every morning at the breakfast area, you will see Philip walking around, smiling and asking every guest about their experience, and he's ready to address it on spot.) 2. This is a VERY clean and newer facility throughout. It makes me feel this is almost a Hilton Garden Inn. 3. Free shuttles to airports and downtown tourist spots ( hotel to Prudential, Boston Common, Aquarium, back to hotel) 4. Free breakfast: pretty good for free breakfast. Guess the quality has improved after someone commented at this site in the past and Philip intervened. 5. Fairly convenient to Buses and Ts. This is the reason I chose this Hampton Inn versus the other two). You can get on 1 or CT1 buses and get to the Ts easily (Silver Line to Chinatown, Orange Line to Aquarium/Children Museum, and Green Line to Science center/Galleria/Charles River boat tour). 6. Swimming pool. It's a shallow one 3 1/2 feet. Great for my toddler daughter. Cons: 1. Front desk staff could smile more and be more friendlier compared to other hotels. 2. Shuttle driver wasn't consistently reliable on schedule. I talked to Philip and he started a sign-up sheets for shuttles. Things improved!! 3. Ambulance noise could be bad as the medical center ER is right across the street. Some guests commented previously. But it isn't bad for us at all, and it's just typical busy city noise like the NYC we stayed a week earlier. Recommend you get a higher floor and the opposite end from street.

It was frustrating to watch other hotels' shuttles come and go multiple times while waiting for mine. The room did not have black out curtains. It just has sheer curtains. That may have just been my room, maybe others are different, but I didn't like not being able to close my curtains. PROS: The price was very reasonable for such a nice hotel. It was an upscale place. The hotel was pretty and very clean. The room was spacious and very accomodating. The bed was very comfortable. I usually do not sleep well in hotels and I slept very well here. The front desk staff were very polite. My friend and I got lost a ton, they gave us maps and help in finding certain places which we really appreciate.

My whole reason for selecting the hotel was their shuttle to the hospital, and this was actually not available to me.

I was attracted to the rate and it was a fair cab ride to Fenway Park. I can only compare this to other Hampton Inns. I think some of the negative reviews on here are unfair if you consider that Hampton Inn is not a Ritz Carlton or Grand Hyatt. I thought the rooms were a fair size and most important, they were clean. The pool was closed due to renovations but the Hampton clearly posted that on their corporate web site so it didn't come as a surprise. They offer a free breakfast but don't get to excited, the day I was there, it was cereal, french toast sticks, fruit, toast, and bagels. I think they had biscuits, I forgot. But I've read some reviews here where they had waffles so I guess they weren't serving them that day. My only suggestion to breakfast is to add eggs and to provide a microwave oven because some of the hot stuff cools down after some time. But again, it's free so I'm not going to push that issue. I wasn't crazy about the location since there is a hospital across the street so you will be hearing sirens from outside. One thing I didn't notice was there was this restaurant downstairs that turns into a night club lounge on the weekends. If you are into urban hip hop with r&b, then you will like it. There was a line out there pass midnight but I have to commend the hotel for the fact that such a late night establishment exist on their property and yet, it does not interrrupt the peace both inside or outside. My other commendation goes to the General Manager who was every where greeting guests and offering his assistance. And if you had an issue, he would call you directly to try to resolve it. That's A+ service. The business center was alright. Contrary to a previous review from someone else, there were 2 computers, not 1. But let me tell you what was really good for me; The shuttle van. I called the hotel from the airport and they communicated with the driver that I was waiting. He showed up in a timely manner and it turns out that the shuttle takes guests to some other points of interest around Boston. They have a schedule but maybe if you ask nicely, they could drop you off somewhere outside of their schedule close-by. Don't bank on that idea because I didn't try. I'm just saying that it doesn't hurt to ask. So you can cab it or walk the several blocks to the nearest T stop. If you are here on a short visit like a weekend or for a few days, then you should give this a shot for all the reasons I pointed out.

Given that it was at least $100 less than most of the conference hotels and the conference was offering a shuttle to the Convention Center, I stayed at the Hampton Inn. I drove to the hotel and ended up driving right by it the first time. Crossroads is right -- it is sitting right in the middle of busy Massachusetts Ave and Albany Street -- and I drove right by when I got to the intersection because the writing is very, very tiny near the Albany Street door. Had I been traveling streets away, I would have seen the glow of \"Hampton Inn\" from the top of the hotel... but that was not the case. After figuring out that I must have missed it, I managed to get myself to the intersection and find the entrance (which is opposite the Albany Street entrance). The parking garage is located across from the hotel on a small side street. It is a commuter lot, but you can park for $25 a night via the hotel. The hotel is located near BU Medical Center, which is not the type of area that you can get out and walk around safely at night (plus there really isn't anything around). So you are a bit isolated. I kept my car parked but took the conference shuttle, hotel shuttle, or cab. The hotel itself is designed as a boutique hotel. I'm not sure what it was before, but there are little touches that indicate they they are trying to be a bit chic (i.e. black and white photographs with catchy sayings). Check-in went fine, but I realized afterwards that my request for a \"quiet room\" was not granted since I was given a 3rd floor room facing the street. I didn't realize this until later at night and by the time I asked to be relocated the next day, all the rooms were full. I was disappointed in my room initially, but I can say that they really, really do try to make it a nice hotel. The bed was great, the workspace and free wi-fi were great, the microwave, fridge, and little kitchenette space were great. Aside from the street noise, I ended up liking my room by the third day. Breakfast was not very good relative to hot items or breads, but I was glad for the coffee, fresh fruit, and yogurt options. As mentioned above, the hotel offers a complimentary shuttle which goes to the waterfront, the Prudential Center, and Boston Common. The driver who works the 2-10 shift was great. He really enjoys his job and looks out for his customers. He's a real honest, hardworking guy... and he'll go out of his way (between scheduled times) to pick up guests.

It was very nice, with comfy bed and clean rooms. Even though the hotel is on the outside of the city center, it was only a few blocks away from the subway station and the bus stop was right out the front door of the hotel. The shuttle drivers were nice for the most part, but if you don't tip them, don't expect them to come back for you.

After I informed my contact where I booked they were quite alarmed since the neighborhood apparently is not too friendly, but I must say I haven't really had any trouble. The rooms are good and clean, although the walls are a bit thin. Sounds carry over easily from other rooms, especially through the ventilation system. Another major contributor to the noise is the proximity of the hospital which is just around the corner, with ambulances going by very regularly. Nothing too bad though. The complimentary wireless internet access is definitely a plus. Speed is decent and it's very reliable. Staff is very friendly and helpful. I haven't tried the shuttle services, so I can't comment on it. The location is not too good if you want to have quick access to a good restaurant, bar or theatre. There is a Ground Round bar adjacent to the hotel which is pretty decent but will gett a little boring if you need to spend more than two nights in a row there. So getting a taxi into the city center seems to be the only option. The breakfast is reasonable although a little one-sided (sugar) and all in all I have to say I'm pretty pleased with the hotel. So if you're looking for a decent hotel for a reasonable price, and you don't take too much notice of the ambulances rushing past every now and then, this might be one to consider.", "Date": "March 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "MimiScotland", "ReviewID": "UR6533444", "Content": "Great friendly service, very clean, shuttle service to city centre every half hour was very useful.
