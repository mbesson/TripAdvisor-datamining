Rooms seem a little overpriced, but are in the range of Jimbaran Boutique Hotels. The 2 pools are very nice at any time of the day. The Staff ist very friendly and helpful. We wolud always come back.The Beach is close, but only if you manage to go through the Intercontinental Hotel, which ist difficult most of the time because of their security stafff. Otherwise you have to walk 15-20 Minutes, but you are rewarded with the best beach in Bali and nice Foodstalls on the public Beach. It ist also a good place for first or last nights when flying in or out to/from Denpasar since the Airport is only 10 Minutes away and they have a free pcikup service.However, don't follow any of their recommendations of other hotels, neither in Jimbaram (when Balquisse is full) nor in any other places. We ended up in two completely ripp-offs, overpriced and shabby.", "Date": "Oct 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR354756139", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Sansibar22"}, {"Content": "The Shaba We stayed at the Shaba after seeing a review in a Travel Magazine in the UK.How glad we wereWe spent 10 days there for our 10th anniversary in June 2008.We had every intention of staying Club at the Intercontinental as we were married there.The whole ambience of the Shaba is outstanding, the rooms are huge and fitted to a high level, the outdoor areas are just breathtaking, and the personal service you get as a guest of the Shaba is wonderful. and the price is 50% cheaper than Club level at the Inter.Don't miss out on a massage, genarally a free 1/2 hour for each 3 days you stay, and don't, please don't miss out on the food.

I suppose perfect if you want to be on your own and hate big 5* hotels. The rooms of the hotel were nice but very dark. I had the impression of cash the maximum but give the minimum. We only had one small bottle of complementary water for 3 people. The maids did come and prepare the beds in the evening but didn't bother to arrange the bathroom, unlike all 5* hotels. Afternoon tea and cakes were offered. For 3 people we got 5 (1,5 cm x 1cm) pieces. The cups and tea pot were still there the following morning. Breakfast was minimalistic but good. To get to the beach you had 3 possibilities: free shuttle every 2 hours, 20 min. walk or 3 min. walk through the Hotel Intercontinental of course not allowed so we always had to pretend to be guests of Interconti. The Villa Balquisse villas however are supposed to be much nicer than the hotel rooms. I found the standard room better than the deluxe room. As a boutique hotel (also in the book Bali Chic) and if you want to compete with the big but without the facilities you just must have the little things that matter and make the difference which was not the case! We wish that we had stayed in the Hotel Intercontinental. If you want to stay in Ubud you must stay at Tegal Sari. It is great and value for money ... and we are used to staying in 5* hotels.", "Date": "Nov 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR876386426", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Kalyani"}, {"Content": "Great friendly place We stayed at Villa Balquisse this September and were very happy.
