Bus station is 5 min walk and Newton MRT station just 15min walk from this hotel. It was a very relaxing stay with helpfull front desk staff. No charge for extra pillow/towel n rooms was cleaned daily. Its about SD20 from hotel to Changi Airport by Taxi.

The location of the hotel is very good. Its located in a very quiet and posh residential area of Singapore. So no sleepless nights due to road traffic noise etc.The Balmoral Plaza is next to this hotel which has restaurants, multi-utility stores like 7-11 and medicine etc. The Newton MRT stn is 7 min by walk with small children and the bus stand is 4 min on the Bukit Timah road. The room was very spacious and generous. They had put an extra bed for our family which made our lives much easy. Air con was decent. Linen was sparkling clean and was changed every day along with towels etc. The carpet in the room was old and needs a change or can be done away with. The bathroom was clean and hygienic. The room had a small fridge, electric kettle with tea bags etc, an LCD TV, iron on demand and telephone. The buffet area is small and cozy. The breakfast is pretty basic but I guess if you are on holiday with a budget, its ok. The pool is next to the buffet area and comes very handy to relax after a tiring day while holidaying. The cabs are easily accessible from the reception. Some cons :- Very cold behaviour of the staff at reception. Limited drinking water (only two litres per day) and tea sachets in the rooms. Just 10-12 channels in the TV provided. No free internet. Suggestions :- Improve the breakfast, may be add some fruits etc. Provide atleast 1 lit of drinking water per individual per day . Provide increased amount of tea sachets. Provide wi-fi internet access free of cost in the rooms. Overall : Highly recommended for a family holiday where one wants to spend more on tourist attractions and less on accomodation.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bali, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "koolmusik", "ReviewID": "UR121184114", "Content": "It's located in a residential area closed from all the mayor shopping area.

The hotel is in the business district and based in a very good residential area called Balmoral street. The choice we made hence was good as there is silence in the area.

Huge rooms (27 sq meters where as downtown the same priced room is only 9 !), a staff you can talk to and who did there jobs with pleasure and utter quietness at night. Situated in a upscale neighborhood on a tiny street with no through traffic, it's like you are in a cocoon of peacefulness and stability. A well established inn (since 1973, with many remodels, and now complete) run by a real innkeeper, Mr.Tan, who has designed his lodgings for his guests to like, not just endure. It feels like the sort of inns who visited in a different time, when people cared if you came back! Yes: you do have to take a cab to get to the \"sights\", but they are cheap and if you are young, the MRT is 10 minutes away by foot. Yes: there are a handful of restaurants ranging from the cheap and good to the fabulous and expensive, all 5 minutes away on foot, and a upscale grocers just down the way. A great pool with built-in jets to ease those aching muscles from walking all over Little India, too. All of this for the least than the cost of the windowless cubicles downtown.

They did not even provide us with a candle or torch and we had to wait in the corridor for a few hours . Did not feel safe in the hotel and will never go back there.
