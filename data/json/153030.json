{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A secure entry point into Mexico City We have stayed at this hotel for months, so I have an extensive review to write.Coyoacan is the safest district in Mexico City, and the best place to stay for new arrivals. It is touristical, and clean. Accomodation options are not varied, however, and Suites Coyoacan is probably one of the most convenient, secure and practical places to stay. It is fully gated, and the staff are entirely trust-worthy.The suites are nothing special. They tend to be a little dark and decorated oddly, at an attempt at classic Mexican. They are not cosy, but they are comfortable and clean. The beds are average, and the kitchen is amply stocked, although the dinnerware is antiquated, and the utensils are cheap and not well maintained. The kitchen has not been updated since the early 70's nor the bathroom, although it is very clean. The gym appears to be made up of equipment taken off the side-of-the road, and the garden, while peaceful, is not practical, because it has no function - a barbeque area with no tables and chairs, for e.g.You have no privacy at these suites, because the staff are always spying on you, checking on who is coming and going - asking your guests for identification. You need to clear security any time you want to leave or enter this place. This can be quite frustrating. The staff are constantly in your face, whether it is to clean your suite, bug you for this or that, or just to check on you. They constantly walk passed your windows and look in - even though there are two bedrooms, you are only allowed two people, and any extra people staying, get charged exhorbitant fees.Parking is extremely impractical and on three occassions, we scratched and dinted our car trying to get out of a space that is really only meant for bicycles.Pricing was reasonable when we first negotiated with the manager, and then on subsequent stays he would not honour agreements we made over the phone, and then started charging us all these extras (300 pesos for an old vase that I broke and 200 pesos for a plate that was chipped and old anyway) Given that we where guests here for several months over a period of time, we where very surprised, when on our last visit, he added 1000 pesos to the bill for internet use (even though we where giving him $140USD a night over a 12 week stay) and 50 pesos a kilo for laundry even though I was supplying the soap. Then they insisted a guest had stayed over, and wanted to charge, when eventually I had to insist that security play back the tapes to prove that the guest had left after her visit the night before. The most frustrating thing lately in dealing with them is confirming prices with him over the phone, only to arrive and be told that it is now a different price, or that tax must be payed on top, or that the room you booked is not available and be given a cheaper room but not immediately offered the corresponding price. They treated us well for a long time, and given that we where long-term customers, we really did expect to continue to be treated that way, given that we always took good care of their suites, payed on time e.t.c We recently called him again to stay, and he wanted to charge us $140 a night for a room that not 6 months ago he had given to us for $90. Further to that, staff exploitation is quite evident here. Maids, when pressed, admit that they only make 700 peso per week ($70AUD) and the security guards are forced to work 24 hour continual shifts. While it most definately goes on in other hotels, given that there are only 8 suites here and about 8 staf, you get to know them personally. The maids come to work at about 10, and I would often see them leave at 10pm at night, even though everyone knew they lived on the other side of the city.Overall I would recommend this place to visitors, given the lack of competition in this really great zone, however I find they are way overpriced for what they offer. The suites have a feel of government or commission housing about them. It was the friendliness of the staff, safety and security that kept us coming back.Now we prefer to stay at the Suites Del Carmen a few hundred metres away, because it is private, light, all inclusive - in that guests can stay, you have your own laundry room and internet is included - and it costs just under $100Aud a day.", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR447664539", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Proffess"}, {"Content": "Nice Suites, close to subway and great food We stayed at Suites Coyoacan for six nights while we were in Mexico City for a friend's wedding. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. The manager and the desk attendant both spoke english, which was helpful in getting directions and finding transportation. We stayed in a Master suite, which was nice. It had two rooms, one with a queen bed and the other with two single beds. The living and dining area were large and fully furnished, although the couches were not that comfortable (wooden with cushions). The kitchen had a nice fridge and stove, and the cabinets were full of dishes. House keeping was great, they did our dishes a couple of times when we left some out on the table, and brought us plenty of clean towels etc. However, if you stay here you should bring some slippers because the floors dirty your socks. (I'm not sure if this is standard in mexico city or just this location). Otherwise the place is great.The location is wonderful, it is less than a block from the coyoacan subway station, which is about a half hour from downtown. It is also within walking distance (30 min) to two parks that have really great restaurants all around. Frida's house and a great market are also nearby.", "Date": "Jan 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR218417232", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "palott"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d153030-r18382500-Suites_Coyoacan-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "153030", "Price": "$100"}}
