{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Hotel Booked the hotel with SPG points for one night. Wanted to get away to the city from the peninsula for my kid's birthday. Was looking for a hotel with good Christmas decor, swimming pool and overnight parking nearby. San Francisco hotels normally charge over $40 minimum a night for parking. There was Hearst parking next door ($20 for a 24hr period) ; no in-out previleges but was good enough for me and also has a CPK in the same buliding. About 10 minute walk to Bloomingdales and San Francisco Shopping Center. The rooms are nice with LCD HDTV with actual HD channels including HBO. The Christmas decor was very nice in the lobby and the restaurant. Had a traditional European feel to it. Kids loved it. Swimming pool is nice and indoor but the was definitely not warm and a little bit salty, yuk. Kids had fun nonethless, so, apart fron the pool everything else was good. Will probably return for my other kid's birthday.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR502940155", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "semiconman"}, {"Content": "They call this the Palace!?! really wanted to be a fan of this place, just by stepping into the lobby and meandering the halls of the first floor. (Wow, that atrium is amazing!) Looks and names can be deceiving, right? The rooms, the spa, the pool are dreadful. I had anticipated the rooms to be on the smaller side (duh it's San Francisco!) so that wasn't an issue. However the carpets were dingy and the bed and linens were circa 1990 just by their overused feel to them. The fiance and I had booked services at the spa which were just hotel rooms converted into spa rooms! what?!? And it seemed as if whoever administered my massage also distributed the towels at the nearby indoor pool! The pool a lazy little rectangle in the middle of a damp smelling indoor space w/windows that haven't been cleaned, maybe the person in charge was out giving a massage.And they call this the Palace! please.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR559169777", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "form2"}, {"Content": "Warm and friendly staff at the Palace.

My Fianc\u8305 and I stayed here 11/28-11/30. It was our 10-year going out anniversary.

I was referred to the hotel by someone at work, who said the brunch was wonderful, so I checked out the website and totally fell in love. While we were on our stay my boyfriend proposed to me.

We booked a 7 night stay via Expedia back in April. There were 6 of us in the party. After an 11 hour flight and a 3 hour delay we arrived at San Francisco airport and were transferred by Shuttle Express direct to the hotel, this took about 30 minutes.Check in was quick and we were all allocated a Superior room. The rooms were spacious, with king size bed, plama tv, fridge, safe and bathroom with shower.Throughout our stay the rooms were cleaned daily and new towels given, we had bathrobes in our rooms also.There is a good sized pool and jacuzzi and sauna on the 4th floor.We only ate once for Christmas Day breakfast which was pricey for a buffet but excellent nevertheless.The hotel itself is stunning. Huge dining rooms and due to it being Christmas week very nicely decorated.The bar service was efficient but again pricey.The location of this hotel is excellent with the Bart and bus stops outside the hotel door.This was our first visit to San Francisco and we think it is a great city with plenty to explore. Our visit to Alcatraz was very enjoyable. We took a 30 minute helicopter ride which was a great experience especially when the pilot looped us under the Golden Gate Bridge and flew over the top again!!! Christmas Day was spent riding bikes across the Golden Gate Bridge, we also visited Fisherman's Wharf, took a 1/2 day wine tasting trip in the Napa Valley region and also hired a car to explore Montery and Carmel - stunning locations!Overall we all thoroughly enjoyed our holiday - a week just wasn't long enough!!To return to the Palace Hotel each night made our holiday even better.A stunning hotel in a great location!!

I just returned from spending two nights at the hotel, and observed the staff giving their usual good service to guests. During a stay in July of this year, we did have a toilet overflow just before checking out. The housekeeping staff did not deal with it to my satisfaction -- mostly, I suspect, due to a language problem. I later communicated my concern to the general manager's office in writing and received the appropriate letter explaining how the matter had been investigated and dealt with. I was offered an upgrade on my next stay, which I have since enjoyed.I have read several recent reviews and can state that I have never had the service problems that others described.

When I discovered it was the only property available on a corporate rate I was thankful and happily booked it.The hotel has an unbeatable location, as many have pointed out. To be able to get to it by BART was worth the 15 block walk to my conference the next day. The lobby was beautiful, it reminded me a little of the Peninsula in Hong Kong. The service at check in was impeccable. What is somewhat peccable is the room sizes, mine was quite small and I had a view of a large internal granite roof on the third floor. That was when I remembered I'd stayed in a very similar room maybe 14 years ago for an interview. The furnishings were fine, lots of blue fleur-de-lys type insignias and a dark wooden closet that was attractive enough.When I arrived I was still jet-lagged from Asia, so finding the nice bath products and then retiring in a fluffy bathrobe made it overall a very satisfactory experience. Perhaps they only put guests on corporate rates into rooms like that but when one is coming from Asia the overall effect is underwhelming.I appreciated the coffee and fruits downstairs at 6am when I had to check out, it was a nice touch. I would stay again if I knew I was getting a big room or a really great price, but wouldn't go out of my way.", "Date": "Dec 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR276765257", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Public_Dave"}, {"Content": "Splendid Stay! I have stayed in many hotels in SF and this is one my favorites. I got an excellent rate through Priceline. I'm sure I got the cheapest room but it still was quite nice.

Decent size, comfy King bed, big flat screen TV, robes,Gilchrist toiletries etc. The Hotel is about the most convenient for public transportation you can get with a MUNI/BART stop right at the hotel entrance. The mini fridge didn't work but they fixed it at my request within a couple of hours.Internet is $$$ (16.99 per day) but I managed to get a wireless signal in the room although they say its only free in the lobby.

We have family in from Paris and I wanted to find a classic San Francisco hotel for our stay. I found a good deal on a 2 double bed suite and decided to book a reservation. The property is very elegant, especially the atrium where we enjoyed a nice, but very pricey brunch. I know our guests will remember their experience for years to come. The location is also noteworthy but parking can be a challenge.I do have a few complaints, however. When we arrived I headed for the concierge desk believing it to be the reception area. The concierge took two long phone calls before acknowledging me standing before him. I waited for almost ten minutes until he finally directed me to the reception area. I had to wait almost 25 more minutes to check in as they only had one person at the front desk. Guests became very anxious and frustrated- including me. I had to wait ten minutes to check out because of the same problem.The room was also not without fault. The bathroom fan and hair dryer didn't work, the windows didn't open (as promised) and the bathroom curtain had a very suspicious stain on it. The light fixtures in the bathroom were cracked and the bathroom floor was not as clean as I would have liked. I am not very picky when I am getting a cheap room, but this was not a cheap room (the going rate for it was $400) and as such, it should reflect the elegance and class of its category.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR429992356", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "cristinasabin"}, {"Content": "Beautiful and grand We were very fortunate when using Hotwire and searching under 4 stars to get the Palace Hotel. I was not from the area, and my girlfriend had heard only good things about it. Much to our benefit, the Palace was extremely gorgeous both in its interior and exterior. The ball room, bar, and restaurant are lovely in their aesthetics and glitz. The room was large with a big closet, mini-fridge, nice 30 inch flat screen TV, and superb washroom. The bed was also extremely comfortable and perfect for long nights and late mornings. There's also a very convenient BART/Metro exit right next one of the Hotel Entrances so very convenient for travelers and tourists. Checking out was not made entirely clear, because when using the TV/Online service it failed to work, so we went downstairs where we waited about 20 minutes to check out. That was about the worst part of our experience at the Palace. I honestly cannot say much good or bad about the service as it was not fully tested by our stay. I will say every time I called the front desk, I was put on hold for good lengths of time to simply ask for more towels or a local question. I would not hold this against them entirely since they were rather busy the Veterans Day weekend. Overall I think anyone traveling to SF either first time or regular should check out the Palace. If you can get a deal via one of the website brokers even better.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR955837138", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tomest05"}, {"Content": "Hotwire problem beautiful hotel in good location. Excellent service from bellman , housekeeping and restaurant staff. We were very unhappy with our room and lack of any help from Hotwire. Many of the rooms are small, particularly for a hotel Hotwire gave 4.5 stars. After booking , we immediately asked Hotwire to switch us to another hotel as reviews indicated many rooms were small and some lacked bathtubs. Hotwire responded that they called hotel and were assured we would get a room with abathtub. We arrived after a 7 hour flight and were given a handicapped room with a shower that flooded the room if not used properly. The other alternatives were small rooms which could not properly fit our luggage, which include d 4 suitcases. We stayed in the handicapped room and called housekeeping both nights after the shower flooded the room. Hotwire was no help and basically said you are on your own, deal with the hotel.
