As many reviewers pointed out, the location itself is not vibrant, but it's only minutes away from major attractions. The metro station is easily reached from the hotel. Galata Tower is only a short, yet steep, walk away, and from there, you can reach one end of the lively Istiklal street. My room was extremely small it could barely fit my luggage. However the bed was large and comfortable, occupying almost all the space. The bathroom of my room was not large either, but it's not uncomfortably small. Bathroom and bed were clean. Safe box was not working for some reason. Breakfast was nothing special. I did not have a chance to visit the rooftop. The internet connection was actually very good. What I appreciated the most, is the hospitality of the receptionist. All in all, it was average, given the relatively not cheap rate I paid during that time.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA hidden treasure!...\u201d", "Author": "aysegulbarber", "ReviewID": "UR127256482", "Content": "I stayed at this beautifully decorated boutique hotel for 3 nights...I was very pleased with this exceptionally clean and very friendly hotel which is located in the back streets of Historical Galata region.... The breakfast was very generous with lots of options and the staff was very helpful and polite. My room was on the 6th floor with a breath taking view over the Golden Horn and Topkapi Palace. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was very clean and modern. The location was the main reason I chose this hotel. It was only a 2 minute walk from the funicular railway which takes you from Tunel to Beyoglu. Also the hotel is within easy walking distance of the ferry and bus stops and a short walk to Galata Bridge and the historical sites on the other side of the Golden Horn.

My only criticism is the non existent view from the lower rooms but then you don't go to Istanbul to look out of your room window and the roof terrace more than makes up for it!

It's not located in a fancy area either but it do fulfill all your needs and more. The location is actually very good. 30 m from the subway that leads you to the famous istiklal street(2 min away) where you can shop till you drop. Or if you prefer other shopping destinations you have the tramway and other communications just 150 m away where the Galata bridge is located. From here you can also walk over the bride right to the old town with Grand Bazaar and other attractions such as Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque etc. and it's not more that 7 mins away(to old town). The rooms are normal sized and very fresh. I've stayed at many 5 stars hotels that hasn't got nearly such fresh rooms to be honest. I stayed at room 202. The cleaning of the rooms was not the best because I noticed that only the bed was done but on the other hand I never left the room dirty either. The staff is gentle and some of them staff knows english. The restaurant is a bit small and during breakfast you it feels a bit crowded. They didn't offer what was on the menu the 2 times I asked. First time they said that the kitchen was closed just that day(?) and the second time they could only offer soup of the day and meatballs. There's also a roof bar with an amazing view over the bospor and old town. It was closed during my visit(winter) so I can't say anything about the service.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cilda O \"Super Hotel with effortless friendliness of it's staff....\u201d", "Author": "Ilda O", "ReviewID": "UR124625309", "Content": "Stayed for weekend in this hotel and throughly enjoyed it.
