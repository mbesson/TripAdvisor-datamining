We stayed in April 2012. Me and my friend stayed in what I think was the cheapest room with the worst view but we loved it, who needs a view really when you can actually go outside!? The staff are very friendly, very helpful and make you feel welcome instantly! The hotel has a lot of stairs, but you can't complain because so does nearly every building in Amsterdam. The rooms are very small, not ideal if you want to spend a weekend in your hotel room, but if you plan on leaving the hotel (which I'm sure everyone does) the size of the rooms doesn't matter. The beds were very comfortable, rooms were warm and we didn't have any issues with any noise at all. The only slight criticism I have for this hotel is that our bathroom was very small. This wouldn't stop me going back, I don't suppose anybody really needs mountains of room in a bathroom!? I'm horrendously lazy but the hotel was close enough to bars, shops, coffee shops, tram stations, red light district, canals, the train station and museums, we only went to one bar that we needed to get a taxi. Basically, the hotel is as random and as quirky as the rest of Amsterdam. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, maybe not families (just because of the space). For a hotel in such a good location, with very good prices, I see no reason to complain!!!!

I have stayed here with my husband and with my brother in law and his wife and a few weeks ago I chose it to stay at when I took my daughter to Amsterdam. I am in my 50's and although the stairs are very steep ... and a lot of them ! .. I find them ok to to get up and down as have my previous companions. There is usually someone who rushes to greet you when you arrive and takes your bags off you so you don't need to haul the cases up and down the stairs yourself. They are very friendly and helpful and I feel very comfortable in this hotel which is why I chose it again when I took my daughter to Amsterdam. The rooms are adequate for our needs ( we only intend to sleep in them , not spend large chunks of the day in there) They are smaller than large 5 star hotels but then they are not a large 5 star hotel !!!.... It has 'ambience', is clean and the price for staying there is within our budget and I feel we get value for our money. The continental breakfast is fresh and filling (meat free ) and the time slot for breakfast is quite long ... they have an early arrival policy of minding your luggage and if you arrive in the breakfast time slot then you can have a free breakfast as well :) which was a lovely welcome for us having been up since 4am. The flowers in the room saying 'welcome home' was a lovely touch ... Thank you Nadia Hotel, I really appreciated that. ... We had a twin room at the back, except for the church bells we didn't hear much noise at night and I sleep with the window partly open .... for those of you who like extra wide spaces I will mention that the beds were each against a wall and the gap between the beds was narrow, possibly less than 2ft, and the shower room was 'compact' which didn't bother us but if you wanted a bedroom to swing anything bigger than an average cat in, then you may want to check with reception before you book. !! It had a safe, a fridge and a tea/coffee tray. It is well located for the canals, Anne Franks house, Dam Square, The shops, Restaurants and cafes. It is about a 15 minute walk from Central station for me ( a 53 yr old) and within a half hour walk for many attractions, markets, Zoo, Museums etc... I LOVE this hotel and will deffinately return. My daughter and in laws have also recommended it to friends. If I mention that we stayed in the Victoria Hotel about 9 years ago and prefer to rebook this one does that tell you anything ?

The room was very small and did not contain all the facilities it details on the website. I had to ask for a hairdyer at reception. The view of the canal was scenic though the chime of the Westerkerk clock opposite which strikes at every hour and does a tune as well is ok if you don't mind being woken up during the small hours. Breakfast was a continental buffet help yourself which consisted of coffee, bread, cheese, croissants, cake, and condiments of jam. The breakfast room is quite small so you want to get there at the earliest opportunity to get a table. Not the cheapest hotel either. For a centrally located hotel, just outside the Jordaan, it was \u00c2\u00a3100 a night. This could be justifed if the room were bigger, and there were the add ons of shower gel in the bathroom and the little finishing touches that make it more special. Saying that, they left a vase of fresh flowers in the room which was nice however I would prefer to have a hairdryer and the toiletries! No bath, just a shower which was a bit disappointing as after a long day out walking I fancied a soak in a bath. The beds were very narrow as well though the mattress was ok. The cleanliness wasn't great. There was loads of dust on the shelfing above the beds and the carpet didn't look like it had been vaccumed. The one thing that did get up my nose was the amount of cigarette smoke in the hotel. The staff were smoking behind the reception area or within the vicinity. The website is misleading in saying it is a non-smoking hotel. Also the other kind of smoke was prevalent as well from hotel rooms adjacent to ours. The corridor was full of smoke and it streamed through under our door which wasn't pleasant. I know we were in Amsterdam and it's expected though the hotel shouldn't be the place to smoke their drugs, can they not keep it to the coffee shops? I found the hotel quirky, the staff were helpful, however, the hotel was tired and in need of refurbishment and for the cost of the room, for three nights, it was a disappointment. I have stayed at other hotels in Europe for better quality and value and found that this hotel was not living up to what it says on their tin. Honest opinion; I won't be staying there again but then I won't be going back to Amsterdam again. I have been in the past, seen and done everything I want to see there and don't feel the need to go back again. For people with an interest in the Anne Frank House, the hotel is located opposite. I found that a moving experience and certainly I would recommend it a worthwhile visit. Amsterdam is a lovely City with interesting architecture. Though I find the drug culture a losers game, and it is a shame as it ruins what can be a really great City.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tustin, California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel and hospitality\u201d", "Author": "artdiva26", "ReviewID": "UR126463527", "Content": "I loved staying at this very quirky and charming hotel.

The room reminded me of being on a ship. It is small but i found it cosy if not romantic... The room has everything you need, bed, cupboard, shelves, fridge, telephone, en suite shower n toilet, tv etc/ It was just what we needed. It is basic but its not the Hilton! It had the added bonus of being near Dam square and the majority of the attractions. Anne Franks house is a 5 min walk around the corner. The breakfast was very basic and we were not impressed with this. It was literally coffee, tea, orange juice, croissants, cheese, some spreads and crackerbreads and bread oh and some apples! I asked if they had cereal and they didnt. There was a small kitchen in the breakfast room. Surely they could whip up some eggs or something?? We didnt bother with breakfast the rest of the time we were there. On our last day we were leaving early and breakfast was only 7.30-10.30am. When checking in i did ask if we could have breakfast early. The receptionist told me they could arrange it for 7am. He told us to let him know the day before we leave. This seemed reasonable but after seeing the options on day 1 we decided not to bother arranging an early breakfast. However, on our last day whilst getting ready to check out, reception rang us to say that our breakfast was ready. I felt bad having to say we did not want it but we did not confirm to them that we wanted it. The man at reception told us when checking out that he remembered our request and made a note. We apologised and explained we had to leave for the airport. He tried to make us stay but we wanted to get going and we eventually had breakfast at the airport. Ok, we paid for it and should have made the most of it but there really was nothing that could have satisfied us or sustained us throughout the day.

My boyfriend also complained of how noisy the road was which our room was overlooking, but i really didnt notice this and i slept well.

Because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly off the main areas, we have not experienced any drunken groups wandering loudly past in the early hours. Its worth remembering that it is a city location and the trams run right outside so yes, there is some noise from the traffic and the nearby church bells but this certainly did not detract from the experience. Hotel Be warned, on entering the hotel you will be greeted by the steepest steps known to mankind. As the website indicates, it is not suitable for the elderly, disabled and possibly young children who are just starting to negotiate stairs. However, the stairs are part of what makes the hotel that extra bit special, and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to lug your luggage up and down them as the very friendly and enthusiastic staff are genuinely happy to do this for you.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a family run affair and everyone is genuinely helpful and welcoming. You are given a handful of useful maps and information on arrival and the reception which is staffed 24 hours can help from posting your postcards to giving you directions. Bedrooms As you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from a period building, rooms are small but clean and comfortable. They come equipped with en suites, kettle, TV, fridge and safe. They are cleaned everyday. Plus you are greeted by a bunch of lovely flowers which is a nice touch. Breakfast Room This is also a fairly small room so can get quite busy. However, breakfast runs for a decent time slot (about 2 \u00c2\u00bd hours) so there is plenty of time to chill and wait your turn. The views are lovely overlooking the canal and church. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self service and a basic continental breakfast but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an all you can eat one.

Top tips Visit Sara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pancakes a couple of doors down from the hotel for every kind of pancake imaginable. If you are looking for a quieter coffee shop try Paradox which about a 5 minute walk away. Great music, relaxed atmosphere and great hot chocolate. There are a few lovely places to eat right near the hotel but we highly recommend San Jovanys next to the Albert Heijn Supermarket where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the most delicious steaks.

The staircase is really high and steep, which wasn't a problem for us with our small luggage, but may be a problem for others. We got to reception, which my girlfriend thought was lovely, decorated nice and quirky and very welcoming. The receptionist was friendly and offered us each a choice of one of the drinks from the fridge behind reception as a welcome drink. She was very helpful offering us maps of the city, and although we arrived earlier than check-in, they prepared our room quickly for us. Upon entering our room, we were pleasantly surprised to see a vase of fresh flowers on the side unit, which is unique as you don't see this very often in hotels like this. The room itself was small, as was the bathroom, but it was also nice, and clean. There was a tv in the room, as well as a fridge and free wi-fi which were nice bonuses. We booked a balcony room, so we were keen to check the balcony out. It was quite small but had a nice little bench to sit on, and a chair. The balcony overlooks the street, but to the left is a nice view of the church and homomonument. As we were staying in November and it was very cold, we were happy to find a fleecey blanket in the wardrobe which was handy to use on the balcony. The bed was comfortable, there was a bit of noise from the street from trams, traffic and the chruch bells, but it went quiet at night and the noise didn't bother us at all during our stay. As we headed out the next day, we were asked if we required our room to be cleaned, which we declined but appreciated getting the choice. When checking out the following day, the receptionist was very friendly once again and actively encouraged us to review the hotel as they like the customer feedback, which we liked as we've never been asked to do this before in other hotels we've stayed in. We had no problems in this hotel during our stay, and I was surprised to find a greeting card email from the hotel at christmas.

As looking at a map will tell you, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also very conveniently located \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about 5 minutes by tram or bus from Central Station, a five-minute walk to Dam Plaza and the Royal Palace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without being in the midst of the tourist traffic that teams along and near Damrak (with requisite noise and trash). At the price I paid, about $110 per night (including everything, pre-paid on hotels.com about 3 months ahead), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very good value, especially with the continental b\u00e2\u20ac\u2122fast. The free wi-fi performed flawlessly. There are a couple of well fed cats, so I assume any rodent problem in under constant control. That said, there were enough things that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like about the hotel that would preclude my returning. There was a slight but persistent odor in my hallway reminiscent of cooking cabbage. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strong but I found it unpleasant. Fortunately, it was not present in my room. Traveling alone, I was accorded what was almost certainly the smallest room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in. The floor space was in the shape of a right triangle, with the room tapering most acutely at the end furthest from the door. The total square footage, not including bathroom, was under 70 ft. It had a small refrigerator\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 on a shelf literally five feet off the floor at the narrow end of the room, over the desk (more like a narrow counter). The bathroom door opened about 22\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before hitting the bed. A little too claustrophobic considering that the only other public/sitting area of the hotel is the breakfast room, which is open 24 hrs. (chairs & tables, no couches or lounge area). The walls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cherry-tone old wood paneling and dark blue carpet gave the room a gloomy feel. The one window, which was large, opened onto a small interior patio allowing some indirect light in daytime (but why would you stay there in the daytime). The bed clearly sagged in the one spot where almost assuredly anyone who had ever used the bed would have sat on it to get in or out; the room geometry and bed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position (in the only 90-degree corner) assured that. The mattress was softer than I like and except for the sag, comfortable. I was there five nights and slept well every one. There were ample blankets and pillows. The bathroom was typically euro-small but adequate. However, the vent in the room did more to let outdoor air in than to let indoor air out. It being winter, I had to keep the bathroom door closed to prevent cool air from entering the hotel room. The room was very adequately heated and allowed me to adjust the radiator for heat. It was winter and very cold while I was there, and I was able to keep the room (but not the bathroom) very comfortable. As others have commented, the lobby is two steep, narrow flights up from the street. This didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me but will some. (A hotel porter will happily take your luggage up and down.) My room was one flight down from the lobby, on a locked hallway; the security of the place was good. My room was reasonably quiet, but I could hear conversations clearly of anyone in the hall near my door. Because I had an interior room, there was no street noise. My problem with the hotel is that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a place to spend any time comfortably when not sightseeing or working (my primary reason for visiting was business). My room had two equally uncomfortable chairs, a bed used too often as a chair or couch, and the place didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer enough other comfort or atmospheric charm to bring me back.

Don't be mislead into thinking that Nadia is more like a B&B or eclectic boutique hotel. It's more like a indoor motel. If that's what you're into then go for it.

Even you can discover beautiful garden if you intend to look from the windows of the reception room. If you're lucky, you can see the big parrot which visits routinely this garden for feeding.

All of them can give you an impression to discover interesting things during your stay at this hotel.Fourthly, eventhough rooms are small, but well-designed for easy functionality.

When I began to look for good reviews I would be scared away by the price. I then found this hotel and it seemed to fit the bill - reasonable rates, a room for 4, excellent reviews, free wi-fi, and free breakfast. We were not disappointed. First, it is true that the steps leading to the lobby are daunting. But before we even had a chance to start taking our suitcases up there was someone there to do this for us. Since we had 4 suitcases, this was very welcome. We arrived early so our room wasn't ready yet. But we were given a complimentary soda, asked to wait in the breakfast room while our room was prepared and in about 15 minutes were shown to our room and our suitcases were already there. The hospitality shown by the staff throughout our stay was wonderful and comparable to what you would expect out of a 4 or 5 star hotel. As for the room, it was small but in Amsterdam all rooms are small. Nevertheless, it was big enough for our purposes. It had a nice canal view and of Raadhuisstraat.

The location made up for the fact that the room was pretty tiny (however, with lots of shelves and places to store your belongings, the room felt larger than it was). The bathroom was pretty tiny and an odd shape - it was difficult to maneuver around such a tight space, but this may be unique to the room we stayed in. We had a room in the curved cupola-type part of the building next to the canal so bathrooms in the other rooms might be set up better. My biggest complaints were that the bed was rock hard and there was a constant odor of cigarette smoke coming in from another room and into the bathroom - it may have been coming from the owner's apartment which was right next door to our room. I also recommend if you stay here to skip the canal view or street side rooms and get one of the quiet rooms unless you don't plan to open your windows.

We were greeted by the famous stairs!!! But kindly a gentleman was sent down to collect our baggage. We were given a complimentary drink upon arrival to drink in the lounge whilst our room was sorted out. We were actually upgraded to a nicer room which was very kind. We had researched the hotel before booking so we knew that it was a very compact hotel so we did not expect anything different. The room we had overlooked the canal and clock tower and quite a busy road. The room itself was as we had expected very compact but it was clean and had all the facilities needed for a couple of nights stay, tv, tea/coffee facilities, bathroom, shower etc. The bathroom could have done with having a fan installed in it as there was no window and a faint chemical smell was always present but other than that the shower was adequate although it would have been helpful if the showerhead could have been moved around as the floor got very wet when showering. The bed was very comfortable and the room's temperature could be controlled as you had two windows and a radiator if necessary. We were right next to the breakfast room so we expected early noise but I am pleased to say the noise level was fine. The only downside was that as we overlooked the road it was quite noisy until late at night as the trams went past very regularly. Also the clock tower chimed throughout the night but we both didn't find that a particular problem. My advice if possible is to get a room at the opposite side of the hotel as you would be away from the road slightly. The noise didn't particulary bother either me or my husband though. Breakfast was served from 7.30 until 10am which was good if you didn't want to get up too early. It was a continental breakfast which was lovely and toast was made for you if required. There is a great pancake shop right next door to the hotel too if you fancy something different, Saras Pancakes. The location of the hotel was brilliant, it was 5 minutes walk from the Dam Square and all the shopping roads. It was only a 10 minute walk from the Central Station so despite getting a tram on the way here we decided to walk on our departure which was fine.

As long as the boys are willing and cheerfully able to carry my suitcase upstairs for me, I shall continue to enjoy my stays at Nadia Hotel.

The breakfast, although simple is perfect, and was a fantastic start to each day, the service in the hotel was also first rate and everything was taken care of, from taking bags up the steep stairs, to providing a welcome and farewell drink.

Welcome drink offered on arrival - the receptionist even invited us to go for breakfast when we arrived at 9:00, even though we weren't really entitled to this - lovely touch I thought. Flowers in our room with a note saying \"welcome back home\" - another nice welcoming touch. Excellent location for everything - approximately 200 metres from the back of the Royal Palace on Dam Square. Very steep stairs but the staff will carry and store your luggage for you. Small rooms and bathrooms but nice and clean. Comfortable bed - requested an extra pillow and this was brought to our room whilst we were out. Some rooms at the front have balconies which provide more space. The rooms at the back are probably quieter. The front of the hotel is on a fairly busy road with a tram line. Lovely views of the Westerkerk church. Nice plentiful continental style breakfast to get you going for the day. Coffee/tea facilities in rooms but also available all day in breakfast room.

You can access most places by foot if you're energetic and the canals around the hotel are beautiful. We walked to the hotel from the train station but on the way back we caught a shuttle. Rolling suitcases along behind you on cobblestone streets is not as fun as it sounds. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to feel more culture than at a generic hotel. Why stay somewhere where you feel like you could be anywhere in the world when you can stay at the Hotel Nadia and look out from your tiny, totally neat, funky room and really feel somewhere different. The staff are really lovely and it felt very safe.

It is a wonderful place to stay. The location is excellent, very close to Dam Square (5 minute walk), near many restaurants and across from the Westerkerk, a beautiful old church. It is located on a canal so the views are very pretty. The price was excellent considering how expensive Amsterdam is. The staff was uniformly friendly and exceptionally helpful with all of our requests. The owner is very attentive and concerned that his guest's experiences are optimal. Our first room was not as high-up as we'd wanted so they moved us to a wonderful room at the top of the hotel, taking care of moving our luggage and all for us. They have a number of different wireless hubs, so all of the rooms in the hotel (we stayed on two different floors) appear to get great (free!) wireless service. This was a nice exception to our usual experience at hotels where frequently one can only get internet down near (or in) the lobby). There were only a few modest negatives: the breakfast is very rudimentary so don't count on a fancy spread (e.g. no cereal, no eggs, etc.). The hotel is small, but that is what one expects in Europe generally. The street is noisy so earplugs will help you sleep. But if you're going to stay in a bustling part of Amsterdam that will be true regardless of your hotel. Finally, if you have trouble with stairs this may not be the place for you. There are 34 stairs in a very steep staircase that lead up to reception and the first floor of rooms, with another 37 stairs to the top floor. We found this charming and atmospheric and did not think of it as a negative, per se. However, if you have trouble with stairs due to age or infirmity you might want to think twice about staying here. That said, the staff was extremely attentive to swooping down to carry everyone's bags and also emphasize that they consider it routine to carry your bags down too. So they've done all they can to be sure that the stairs don't present a problem to people. Their attention to this was very welcoming. We stayed in room 413 and highly recommend asking for it. It is at the top of the hotel with views (and a balcony) out towards two sides (including the canal and the Westerkerk). In summary, a wonderful and charming hotel at a great price with fantastic service by a staff that seems genuinely interested in making sure your stay is great.

Instead I booked what seemed to be a decent hotel for GOOD MONEY with a respectable travel company-Thompson. To summarise:- Room tiny, too small for us both to stand up together! (really) Toilet located in 8cm from shower (good for a sit down shower..........?!!) Service poor. Breakfast bad.

The location of the hotel was excellent, in close walking distance to much of the activity in the center, but much quieter and not too close to the action. The chimes of the church nearby rang throughout the night. I found it charming, but others might want a quieter location. The tram was a block and a half away from the hotel. Internet service was free as is the room safe. We were worried, having read some other reviews, that the rooms might have a smell of cigarette smoke, but that was not the case. Staff was very friendly and helpful, giving us helpful information about transportation and attractions and booking a convenient shuttle for us to the cruise center when we left.

Sure there may be cheaper hotels and more luxurious hotels, but when it comes to warm welcome and a comfortable haven, which s good value for money it takes some beating. Our Room I have to say it was small, but it did not feel too cramped and it had all you could need, a TV, Safe, storage space and en suite. The bed was clean and very comfortable. We overlooked the owners beautiful roof top Garden, so the room was quite. Compact and cosy would be my description. Oh and the Egyptian, middle eastern, touches were lovely. The Reception And Staff. Always manned and you will always be created with a warm smile and friendly word. The staff are a mine of information and are a great source of local knowledge. They even rang the local pharmacy for me to see if they were open. Check out all the little nick-nacks and miniature houses. You will have read about the stairs, but the staff are always on hand to assist and you will need to buzz to enter the hotel at street level, a nice reassurance that your security is important to them. On the last night my wife slipped in the rain and hurt her foot. The next morning, our last, the staff looked after us very well, ringing us a taxi to the airport, helping my wife down the stairs. They got her a chair while we waited and gave us some water. We could not ask for better treatment. The Breakfast Room, All I can say is delightful. The Zen TV is very relaxing and the middle eastern touches add to the ambience. If you are lucky you can eat breakfast overlooking the canal and Wester Kerk, perfect way to start the day, as you watch the city come to life. The food is plentiful, consisting of bread, cheese, croissants, jam, biscuits, coffee, tea, all you could want really. If you ask, the ever friendly staff will toast some bread for you. Our stay was short but we loved it. Amsterdam is a great city with loads to do and the Dutch or a very welcoming and friendly race. The Hotel Nadia is a great base to explore. Dam Square is a couple of minutes walk and you can get Trams to all the main sites from there. Anne Francs House is literally across the road and the Jordan area starts just across the canal.

While there are plenty of steps up to reception (a typical Dutch feature) the staff will take your bags from ground level to whatever room you're in and are genuinely welcoming and helpful, not just on arrival. \"Location\". We walked from Centraal Station with luggage and didn't find it too far away (the hotel will email you a \"3D\" walking map) but next time would take the easy 5 minute tram/bus ride. Nadia is very handy for the Jordaan and Anne Frank House particularly. Buses and trams stop near to the entrance so connections are a piece of cake. \"Price\". Anyone who's compared Amsterdam hotel prices knows nowhere is cheap. We found Hotel Nadia to be reasonable by UK city standards and a good deal by Amsterdam standards. \"Facilities\". Rooms had everything in them that we wanted and we slept well. No space is wasted! Liked the balconies that you could actually get a table and two chairs onto. Minor noise from the trams outside but we found it atmospheric. Breakfast room busy and food generous. \"Space\". The rooms all have high ceilings and are big enough, just.

Coffee, Croissants (which were lovely, to be fair!) Bread (you have to ask the kitchen staff to toast it) and some cheese slices. The location is very good, a 5minute walk to Dam Square and about 15 to the red light District. If it hadnt have been for the staff .. i'd dread to think what this hotel would be!

We had an canal facing room without a balcony. The included breakfast was satisfying for the start of a long day of tourist activities. Typically Dutch breakfast. The location can not be beat. Just a few minutes from everything either on foot or trolley. We had a fun time on our trip, and Hotel Nadia was a great place to stay. I recommend it to families or couples. BUT! The stairs are crazy steep and I believe 37 to just register. If you have a room higher, it will be even more. If you are in any type of decent shape it shouldn't be a problem.

We chose \"Nadia\" after detailed research on Tripadvisor (guilty not having given feedback before) looking for a reasonable priced hotel with good reviews. We found that previous reviews had been correct in that the stairs up to, and within, the hotel are very steep but this is consistent with many non corporate hotels in Amsterdam The rooms were spotlessly clean and daily service was faultless. We were asked if it was ok to do room service each day as we handed our keys in. The rooms we had were perfectly adequate in size (103 double and 105 triple). There is outside noise from the surrounding area but nothing out of the ordinary for a city location. Breakfast was plentiful, if basic, and in keeping with the good value offered. The breakfast room did get busy after 9:00 am. The staff and management were extremely helpful, arranging a collection and park service for our car although we had not booked anything prior to arrival (local parking \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 an hour from 09:00 to 24:00) handling all of our luggage and storing our luggage on the last day to give us a full day in Amsterdam until our car was delivered back to the Hotel late afternoon. We even managed to borrow umbrellas on the days it rained. We recommend the Nadia to anyone looking for excellent quality budget acommodation in Amsterdam. One point to note is that the Hotel is B&B only with limited snacks from a vending machine outside breakfast hours (although tea/coffee available free all day in the breakfast room) We found some good restautants near by including the Panorama, at the end of the block (undercover all the way which was good as it rained heavily during our visit) , which was reasonable for Amsterdam (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 two courses for 5 inc drinks) , helpful (meals split between two children with no quibble) with some of the best ribs I have tasted for a long time!", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abbotsford, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "elspier", "ReviewID": "UR115445711", "Content": "The hotel was very centrally located.

Before you can even close your mouth, there is somebody speeding down to personally carry all out luggage to your room. The stairs look much worse than they are and the reception was absolutely wonderful and gave us each a free cold drink ( sprite, coke, dutch sports drink, sparkling water etc.) and the 8 year old with us, a free can of Pringles from the vending machineWhen we checked in they happily gave us two double rooms next to each other instead of the family room we requested. It did work for our family so we didn't insist on the room we had booked. The rooms were rather small and cramped and furnished like a medieval castle. However they had an amazing view of the canal and you could even see Anne Frank's attic from the room!

The breakfast had really good croissants and a lot of little yogurts. Even though the room was small, it was a pleasant experience. The service was almost overly helpful and Hazem, an employee who almost seemed to live at the hotel (he was always there) always carried our ridiculously heavy luggage every where and was very helpful.

The room was quirky, with a balcony and a toilet that was on the small side, but it wasn't a big deal as we wasn't going to be there a lot anyway, although the shower was fantastic. It had a small tv, tea & coffee etc, the usual standard stuff, although I brought my own tea as there's isn't great and tastes weak. It was quiet for us despite being on a main road as the windows closed 90% of road noise out. Breakfast was ok, just usual European fare, tea, coffee, orange juice, bread, cheese, cake, yogurt, apples etc which was enough to just get us going in the morning. We thought the staff were fantastic and always there to help and always had a smile and wished us a good day. This alone made it worth it for us. Ok, so now the dreaded stairs which most people seem to have complained about. They're right in that they are steep and narrow with no lift.

It is on a busy road by two canals very close to the quieter \"7 Streets\" area, the Ann Frank house and to tram stops. Damm Square is about 5 minutes walk away. It's an easy walk to the Wallen district and Railway station (or you can take a tram if you're tired, lazy or heavy-laden). As has been noted by other guests, the steps are very steep and it's a big climb up to the reception. It was an even bigger climb to the top floor, where we were staying. Our room was classed as a double but it really was only big enough to be a single room - and a small one at that (that's even for Europe, for American readers!). The bed was pushed up against the wall at one side, which gave a rather claustrophobic feel, and we had to climb over each other to get in or out of it. There was very little space at the other side of the bed. The small room was crammed with unnecessary shelving units and furniture - including a fridge, slightly worryingly overhanging the foot of the bed - and this reduced the scarce available space further. The bathroom was equally tiny and had to be used with the door open. There was always a good supply of hot water, however. A roof window let us see the street below, but we did not notice any street noise. We found the beds to be surprisingly comfortable. The electrics were a bit unconventional but seemed safe. The breakfast room was very small, too, and we had to wait for a place in the morning. Once we were in, it was very crowded. The buffet breakfast itself was nothing special. The staff were polite and friendly. We were offered a free drink when we arrived, as promised. The guy on reception carried our bags up and down the stairs when we arrived and departed, and stored them for us because we arrived before the room was ready. A bonus that more luxurious hotels often do not provide was _free_ wifi in the room with good signal strength. (Ask at reception for the password.) To the hotel management, I'd suggest stripping out all unnecessary fittings and furniture from the room to maximise space, and decorating it in a crisp style in a light plain colour to reduce feelings of claustrophobia. And if there is not at least 40cm on both sides of the bed, then market it as a single room. Overall, the cramped room, the many steep stairs and the wait for a place at the average breakfast did not spoil our stay in Amsterdam. The location of the hotel meant we were close to almost everything we wanted to see and could use public transport to get to everything else, and the polite staff and comfortable beds made it a more pleasant stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone slim, fit and healthy who would not actually spend much time in it! For someone who just wants a base for exploring the city and a place to sleep, it's a reasonable option, though I suspect there are better choices.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cAll you need and perfect location\u201d", "Author": "oschli12", "ReviewID": "UR112969258", "Content": "I stayed here in June for a short business trip.

I returned late evening and my luggage was in my room as well as welcome flowers. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the train station (Amsterdam Central), a little too far to walk with luggage, but take the #2 or #5 tram and it will let you off in front of the church, backtrack about a half block and the hotel is on the right. Don't take a taxi - it will cost around 12.00 euro for a 5 minute trip. Best option is to arrange for the shuttle - especially when returning to the airport. The room was clean and typical by European standards, not large but had everything needed. The room had a refrigerator, coffee service, safe, and fan. I reserved a room with a balcony, which was nice to sit outside and have coffee in the morning and relax in the evening. The bed and pillows were comfortable. My room faced the main street, I did not think it was noisy - the area is much quiter than closer to Dam Square. But remember, the hotel is located in the city, so expect a little traffic noise. I was there for Queens day - there was very little if any noise the night before the celebration. As they state, there are a lot of stairs, but unless you have a medical issue or just an averision with walking up stairs, you should be fine. Of course I only walked up/down once a day, when I left in the morning and returned in the evening. The staff carried my luggage up/down the stairs, so not having the use of an elevator was a non-issue. The staff is friendly and helpful, always willing to provide assistance, directions, wake up calls, etc. The front desk is available 24/7. The hotel entrance is locked 24/7 and the front door has a camera and speaker to verify who is entering...Big Plus!!!! The hotel is located about 10 minutes from the train station, 5 minutes from Dam Square and 10 minutes from the Red light district. The Anne Frank house is about 1.5 blocks from the hotel - 3 minute walk. Trams and busses are about a half block from the hotel, to the left when you exit the hotel. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. The breakfast was typical European and the food was always good and fresh. Breads, cheese, fruit, coffee, juices, etc. Don't expect any American type breakfast - as you're not in the United States. Try Sara's Pancake restaurant a few doors down from the hotel for any meal - she has wonderful options for dinner.

In my opinion, the hotel has pros and cons. On the plus side, it is centrally located in downtown Amsterdam and also easily accessible via public transportation. The signage is good at the hotel itself and the website had good directions, so it was easy to find for someone unfamiliar with the city. In addition, the staff could not have been more helpful, and their attitudes were very customer-service oriented. When I arrived a staff member offered to carry my suitcase to my room and offered me a welcome drink while they got the room ready. There were flowers in the room when I got there as well, which was a nice touch. The room included a mini-refrigerator and a safe, which was handy. Breakfast was included with my stay, and the breakfast room was nice and the hours convenient. Breakfast included beverages, bread and croissants, yogurt, etc. I experienced several cons, though. The reception area smelled strongly of smoke much of the time I was there, and it did filter up into my nonsmoking room. Also, the single room I stayed in was TINY. The bed was wedged between two walls, and because of that I don't know how a person taller than 5'5'' would be able to sleep in it comfortably. The room itself could have used some redecoration--the sheets and room chair were stained, the curtains were ripped and the bathroom towels were worn. Though I stayed on the back (i.e., quieter) side of the hotel, this hotel is centrally located and thus not in a quiet area. The Westerkerk is nearby, and the bells toll frequently, even throughout the night. In addition, there were birds nesting outside/above my window, and at night their cooing and moving about was pretty loud. Sleeping was difficult. The hotel also mentions on its website that a potential con for those with arthritis or knee problems is that there is a steep and fairly long staircase to the reception area from the street, and then additional stairs up to many of the rooms. For me, the cons unfortunately outweighed the pros, and I would not stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ladame5", "ReviewID": "UR103207388", "Content": "Great location, clean and comfortable room, hospitable staff - all in all a lovely place to stay.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cits all you need\u201d", "Author": "xohxbabyx", "ReviewID": "UR103171713", "Content": "i stayued here in february with my boyfriend. we were just looking for a cheap couple of days away so picked this as was the best price with a good location.

At first I was skeptical about the size of the rooms - I'm a pretty big guy and I certainly like to have some space. Once we got there though it was not a problem at all - in fact the way that the cabinets and wall pieces are shaped, you actually get a phenomenal amount of usable space. The staff were excellent, and very welcoming right from the get go. Free drinks were given to us at both check in and check out, and the flowers we got in the room were really quite gorgeous. Breakfast was excellent - croissants, bread, Nutella, peanut butter, jams, cheese, yogurt, apples and orange juice made for a great breakfast to fuel up for loads of sightseeing. The shower was great in my opinion, and I loved the ceilings both in our room and in the dining room - you could see that what was once a majestic room of some sort had been converted into a large number of small but cozy rooms. The location cannot be beaten - Dam square is literally about 50 meters away. Within two blocks there are two pancake houses, a number of coffee shops and some Italian eateries that are just beautiful. Westerkerk is a block away, Anne Frank house about two blocks away. There are numerous coffee shops within the vicinity, where you can grab a great tasting latte or espresso or pursue ahem other interests. I think the best thing about our experience was our wonderful balcony where we could overlook what was going on. It is true, if you're looking for a bigger hotel room or absolutely can't stand smoke, it's probably not for you. Same goes if you are looking to get to bed before midnight, as the Trams rumble by until about then. Also, the stairs are surprisingly steep, but for those who can handle them, they add an element of dutch charm into the whole experience. Tram stops at Westerkerk just a block away, and from there you can get pretty much anywhere in the city - you can purchase a 24 hour all access tram pass for 7 Euro right on the tram, but to get the longer passes you need to either hit up a machine or go to somewhere like Centraal station where they have information kiosks.

There is no elevator and the stairs to the hotel on level 1 are steep but manageable (most Amsterdam hotels are like this!). It's the small things that made this hotel memorable such as the welcome drink, a run down of the area by Osam and flowers in the room. Room was clean and there was sufficient cupboard and shelf space. Tv with cable channels. Bathroom with toilet and shower. Breakfast was sufficient. Internet was free in the room. Perfect location on the canal and although we did not book a canal view we could see the canal from our room.

The service, we were greeted at the door by a happy, smiling Hazem, who promptly took our cases off us and whisked them immediately to our room. Hazem laughed and joked with us about the stairs (as you have probably seen the pictures on here, but not so bad) and said that he would carry us up to our rooms if we were unable to make them of an evening, which I am glad to say was not needed :-) Osam the owner/manager was waiting to greet us in reception with a welcome drink and a ton of helpful information and leaflets etc on the local area and recommendations for bike hire etc, without us having to ask. Many hotels I have found also charge for the safes, and I was pleasantly suprised to find the Nadia do not. I was also impressed by the fact that it was so security conscious and had a buzzer and camera on the door to let you in, we felt very safe there. Also there was always someone on reception to let you in and deal with any enquiries day or night. Our room was very comfortable with a fantastic view, room 413 on the top floor looking over at the canal, Westerkirk and Ann Frank Haus. The bed was lovely with a feather quilt and pillows, and loved the walk-in dressing area and fresh flowers in the room. Tea and coffee making facilites also very handy. The breakfast room is very charming, and we loved the LCD tv on the wall with the calming beach, listening to the waves crashing on the shore! The coffee is to die for and the croissants, and the very helpful staff will make you toast if you ask. We throuroughly enjoyed the breakfast and it set us up for the day to explore etc. The bike hire place they recommended was excellent too if you are thinking of hiring bikes, and just around the corner. Location, excellent! I have been to Amsterdam twice before and never had the luxury of staying so near to the centre and be on the tram route, it was so close to everything and in a very pretty area with everything close by, including Dam Square only two mins away. I thoroughly recommend the farmers market also (on a Saturday only) where we tried oysters for the first time and brought some tasty dutch cheese (after tasting the whole stall!) and some crafts. We also went to the bigger daily market on Albert Cuperstaat which was worth a visit. We never got to visit the Ann Frank Haus as everytime we went to go the queues were very long, but you would need to get there very early or late I think.

Breakfast was continental; croissants, bread, various spreads and jams, cheese, yoghurt, etc. a great way to start the day!!! yesterday (21st feb) was my birthday, and after i had returned to our room from breakfast, the room was re-made, and another, bigger bunch of flowers with a card saying \"happy birthday!\" - a lovely personal touch. even on checkout today, we were welcomed to return before we headed home, where we could sit in the breakfast lounge and drink tea and coffee... we took them up to the offer!! baggage was also stored securely for us, ready to collect when we were ready to leave amsterdam. to summarise, definitely use this hotel, we will us it again!! the staff were an absolute delight - so friendly, and i think this is why this hotel is so popular. thank you for your kindness and hospitality and thank you for my birthday flowers!! room 210, 18/2/11 - 22/2/11", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Gallen, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201csmall but very comfortable\u201d", "Author": "sirjoe76", "ReviewID": "UR97550948", "Content": "small room, but nice and clean. very comfortable beds. we didn't spend much time in the hotel.

We referred to the Tripadvisor selection of hotels in Amsterdam while in Germany and emailed a reservation for 4 adults at the Nadia. They responded promptly and offered us 2 rooms. When we arrived at the Amsterdam train station we decided to walk to the Hotel. The reviews said it was within walking distance. With our bags in tow, the first thing we notice was the bicycle parking compound. There were literally thousands of bicycles parked there. The walk was quite exciting, looking in the shops and walking past the canals. When we arrived, we buzzed to enter. The door was opened and there it was, the steep stairway to the hotel desk and rooms. I wouldn't advise staying here if you have trouble with stairs, as there were no elevators here. Don't worry about the luggage. The staff will take care of bringing them to your rooms. We were told that our rooms weren't quite ready and so we were directed to the cozy little breakfast room and offered a complimentary beverage. I think the staff needed the time to bring the luggage and bouquets of fresh cut flowers in the rooms. ROOMS: The rooms are quite small, but comfortable. We had room #4. In it we had 2 Single Beds, a Water Closet, Shower, Basin, TV, and Phone The room had a large window, with a canal and church view. BREAKFAST There is a cozy room set up with a buffet style breakfast and a tiny balcony with a great view. STAFF The staff were the friendliest and most accomodating that I've encountered so far. Mr. Osam (manager) offered to show us his flower garden that is nestled in the hotel complex. The door to enter is about 18 to 20 inches in width. When you enter you'll see various exotic plants and a collection of garden gnomes. He takes alot of pride in his collection and we felt honored to be able to view them. NEARBY ATTRACTION The Anne Frank Huis is about a block away. Just past the church and along the canal. We accidentally stumbled across it, while on a walk. If you are looking for a unique, cozy and welcoming place to stay in Amsterdam, I recommend the Nadia.

Perfect start to exploring Amsterdam! The hotel's location is also not a bad start whatsoever to exploring the city; my boyfriend and I walked everywhere from the hotel. It's right behind the hip Nine Streets, and there are lots if cafes, restaurants (please try foodism - a tiny restaurant not far from the hotel with amazing pasta, friendly staff, and cool jazz playing in the background), and shops outside the Nine Streets around the hotel. There's cable tv in the rooms with channels in almost every language, there was a tiny fridge in the room which was a life-saver, as well as a kettle and coffe, sugar and milk. The pillows are also super comfortable, and there's a safe in the room, which was very comforting.

The noise and tram did not bother me at all as some had complained. The room was narrow and small but everything functional and CLEAN! The only complaint I have is that the room got so hot it was a bit unbearable so I had to open the window (considering that it was winter this is not so bad). The water pressure was good but sometimes the knobs are sensitive and water got too hot or too cold. The attitude of hotel is personable, friendly and helpful. The reception offered me a hair dryer and a converter to charge my batteries. The breakfast room is cozy. The croissant was so fresh and delicious!! The location is excellent and only 6 min walk to dam square. I felt safe in this neighbourhood walking at night. My flight was in late afternoon so stored my bags with them while I went to Anne Frank House in the morning.

Having just come from a very cold, unfriendly hotel in Paris where no one even smiled, we were thrilled to be greeted so warmly by everyone at the Hotel Nadia.

They were ready with their guidebooks to help us explore Amsterdam, and our room even had fresh flowers.

To make a long story short housekeeping saw us leave and took the tip before we were even half way down the first flight of stairs. (That was when we remembered our jacket and went back.) It is unfortunate the gentleman handling our baggage will have no idea he was ever left a very nice tip. I is also possible that perhaps they all share tips? Or perhaps all tips go to housekeeping? On to the positive... FANTASTIC location. We walked everywhere. The set up itself was unusual because I am from Canada and this was my first trip overseas but I very much appreciated the experience. The service was unbelievable. They did everything they could to make us comfortable even when we were early on arrival. The front desk would get very busy and the lady working was always a pleasure no matter how busy you knew she was. I stayed in a room with two others and my sister, her husband, and their toddler stayed in another room. When assigning rooms they did a great job a finding what was suitable. Our set up was perfects for a couple and a single and my sisters was perfect for her and her husband and the toddler. We were on the top floor and although many might see the stairs as a negative I very much enjoyed them. Definitely must be able to walk stairs but was no a huge issue even with the youngster around.

The Room We had a twin room with a full canal view. It had everything we needed, a fridge, TV, kettle and a bathroom with a good powerful shower - always a bonus. It was very small - we had to negotiate moving around the room and it was fairly cold on the bed under the big window as there is no double glazing - being at the end of November it was pretty cold anyway! The beds were also small singles (2ft) but were quite adequate for our 4 night stay.

Finally, when I asked for a non-smoking room they let me know that although smoking is not allowed, they could not guarantee it as it is hard for them to enforce.

I found this hotel through a simple search on the internet, made a request and got immediate response and confirmation of booking. The staff is extremely nice and welcoming. The rooms are very warm, cosy, and the administrator and his colleagues, thought of every small detail to make a guest feel like an invited friend in their room. Starting with the fresh bouquet of flowers that is waiting for in your room you when you arrive, finishing with the small tea-pot and conditions to prepare your own tea - they thought of everything. Breakfast had all the necessary ingredients. The only bad thing about my stay there was that it was so short! Thank you \"Nadia\" team!

The reviews are often in poorly written English, even from people who purport to come from the UK. Read carefully and draw your own conclusions.

I booked this hotel because it was right next to all the main attractions of Amsterdam, from Dam Square to Anne Franke, and close proximity to the main train station and Van Gogh Museum. You want to be right in the heart of it all? Then stay at the Nadia! WARNING: I knew very well what it meant to check into a 2-3 star hotel in Amsterdam. Not many people do, so let me explain. This hotel can be compared to staying at a friends apartment. This \"friend\" knows everything about the city. The only difference here is you get your own shower, people to help with your bags and a consistently friendly staff. The rooms are a bit tight, but for the price and location, this hotel is a true find. If you're lucky enough to be reading this, then consider this your lucky day. Stay at the Nadia and I guarantee you'll be writing a review like this after your stay. BEST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE: The airlines lost my baggage. When I got to the Nadia hotel and informed them, they took it upon themselves to keep track of my bags progress and make sure it got to my room upon arrival. That brought a whole new meaning to customer service. PERSONAL NOTES: If you go there...make sure to say hi to \"Mo\" ;) He'll make you feel right at home. Oh, and have fun walking up the stairs.

Pay the attendent on board (Euro 2.60 per person - good for a 1 our ticket) and exit about 7 minutes later at WesterMarkt.

Beyond breakfast, try Il Panorama, an Italian cafe at the other end of the \"covered porch\" in front of the hotel, around 200 feet to the right as you exit the hotel door. I am not a fanatic but have consumed my fair share of pizza in my day and I can truthfully say that their cheese pizza, though it sounds simple and bland, was the best I have ever tasted. The waitress suggested that it was the Dutch cheese. That combined with the perfect crust earned the Panorama a 10 out of 10. Finally, the hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the Anne Frank house/museum and the WesterKirk next door to it. Note: if you have a chime clock at home you will be familiar with the regular sounding of the church bells. If not, consider ear plugs as a sleep aid. Other than that, the hotel was quiet for us.

This really is a fabulous place to stay, it is friendly, hospitable and welcoming and the location is perfect with the majority of local attractions within walking distance. The stairs are of course as steep as they look, but your luggage is taken up and down for you so that did not pose a problem, the reception is 24 hours and you are asked to leave your key each time you go out, again not a problem. We have booked a balcony room with a side canal room and were put in room 205 which was on the same floor as the breakfast room which was handy! As we had read previous reviews we knew what to expect regarding size, road noise and bathroom facilities etc, we were pleased with our room, it had every we needed to make our stay comfortable and the flowers were a really nice touch. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony and watching the world go by, it could be noisy but as it was a busy road that was to be expected. The room had a comfortable bed, tv, fridge, tea/coffee facilities, the hotel kindly lent us larger cups on request. The bathroom was small with a shower area, no bath but not really needed for a short break anyway, overall we had everything we needed, it was compact and comfortable and if you are looking for something other than this then you may be better looking at some of the larger groups of hotels who may be more modern and spacious but would certainly lack the warmth and friendliess this hotel has to offer, the service is really second to none and you always receive a smile and a warm welcome from all the staff. The breakfast room is very cosy, we had lovely fresh warm croissants with cheese every day, there is a selection of bread, rolls and cakes and you could ask for your bread to be toasted. The coffee was lovely, helped by the cartons of cream, it was addictive. I believe you could go in throughout the day and help yourself to coffee. We used the breakfast room a few times during the day as we had problems getting an internet connection in our room, that was not a problem to do so and it was nice sitting overlooking the canal. We did find that the breakfast room got quite busy when we went, which was about 9.15am, but we always got seated. On our last day our airport transfer was 7.20am and we were able to get breakfast before we left, we just let the hotel know the daybefore, they also called the airpost transfer service and arranged our pick up for us, very helpful. Our room was made up on a daily basis, when we went out in the morning we just asked for this to be done when we dropped our key in, our towels were changed daily and our bedding was also changed during our 4 night stay. Before we came to Amsterdam we did a lot of research and also booked a few attracttions on line, mainly to save a bit of time queing up. If you are visiting the Anne Frank house, which is so close to the Nadia we could see the building from our room, I would recommend booking online before you go, this only costs an extra 0.50 cents each and saves around 2 hours queing time, depending on when you visit. We booked a time arriving between 10.15am and 10.45am (you could arrive anytime between this allocation) and it was quite a queue then, you get in through a different entrance and really saves you a lot of your precious holiday time queing up, it was an amazing experience and I found it helped just having read the book and watched the dvd before going, it was one of the highlights of the trip. When we arrived on the Saturday we joined a Sandemans 3 hour walking tour conducted by a guy called Geerk, he was amazing, so funny and informative, certainly recommed this tour as it works on a tipping basis only, and it is in the best interest of the tour guide to keep you informed and we were definitley informed and entertained by Geerk. We has also booked to visit the red light district through Randy Roys Redlight District tours, it had been recommended on trip advisor as the lady doing the tours and I believe owning the company (Kimberley) was meant to be a brilliant, funny and knowledgable guide, unfortunatley when we turned up at the meeting point we were told she was off sick and our tour was taken by someone else, being honest we were very disappointed with the tour and ve even emailed Kimberley the next day with our comments, we also advised her we were to be there a few more days hoping she would offer to do the tour the way we were assuming it would be, but we got an email back saying sorry we did not enjoy it and maybe the next tme we were in Amsterdam we could meet up for a drink, sorry Kimberley but a big thumbs down, that was not the response we wanted. There are a lot of tour companies offering red light district tours that include meeting and talking to ex prostitues which would have probably been more informative and interesting, Sandemans tours do a red light district tour and with hindsight we would have went with them, as a point onf interest as least half a dozen people declined the tour when they heard Kimberley was sick, and also at the drink afterwards the other people in the group were not that overly impressed either. We also visited Madame Tussuads, that was a bit overrated, the Amsterdam Dungeon was geat fun and I would recommend that, it is a bit audience participation but really good, or we thought so anyway. We did a canal trip which to be honest was nothing exceptional, we had booked a combi ticket that allowed us to vist the above and included the canal visit, it was all an experience and worth doing. We had a great time and walked for miles, there is so much to see and do and I could go on for hours, but I better stop here. To sum it up, the Nadia is such a great place, be assured you will not be disappointed if you keep your expectations real, a bit of advice would be to bring earplugs and you will get a more peaceful sleep. There is a supermarket about a couple of hundred yards to the left of the hotel, great for picking up a few beers for the room, or like we did getting some rolls, sandwich filler for a packed lunch, oh yeah, don't forget to try the chips and mayo as thay are great. Please feel free to get in touch if I can help with any info I will. Happy holidays and thanks for reading, hope you enjoy the Nadia as much as we did.

I also felt a little bit deceived by their website, which showed the building at which the hotel is located, and gave the impression that such building was the whole building. It was not, in fact that are many hotels in the same building. That said, the hotel is pretty decent. The price is reasonable (when compared with other hotels on the same category), and the fact that you get your own bathroom (albeit small) is also a plus. There is also free wifi if you are lucky enough to get a room under the reach of their network (I was, my friends unfortunately were not). All in all, I think you will get what you paid for, and my experience staying there was positive.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wolverhampton", "Title": "\u201cabsolutley fantastic.....\u201d", "Author": "debntom", "ReviewID": "UR80461162", "Content": "this is the second time we have stayed in nadia, and we will be staying here on our future trips to amsterdam, nice, clean hotel, the staff are very friendly and make you feel at home, asim was great, he couldnt do enough to help us. we took our friends with us this time, and they will be coming back too, also my friend works in a travel agents, and will be recommeding hotel nadia to all that ask to book up for amsterdam : ))))))))", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Little Gem!!\u201d", "Author": "damenchia", "ReviewID": "UR79573171", "Content": "Very nice hotel A lot of charm!

The room and ensuite bathroom were very compact, but very clean and more than adequate for our needs (all the rooms included a small fridge which was handy) and the rooms we stayed in were lovely and quiet. Due to it being my birthday, a friend had phoned prior to our stay to enlighten the hotel of this fact. They had kindly placed beautiful hand tied bouquets of flowers in our rooms with 'birthday wishes from the Hotel Nadia', which was a lovely touch. The staff at the Hotel Nadia, was, what made it such a lovely place. As they were all amazing and bent over backwards to help us out with anything we needed to know or do. On the saturday the manager (who's name escapes me - sorry) allowed us to use the breakfast room for a short period of time as a meeting area, while waiting for our other friends that were staying out with the Hotel Nadia to join us, This was fantastic, as there was 15 of us in total and the bedrooms - would have never allowed for our gathering prior to going out. Breakfast, was of continental nature, there was always plenty of breads, cheese, yogurts, fruit and drinks. The dining area was snug but added to the atmosphere and quaintness of the hotel. If your looking for a fancy hotel, the Hotel Nadia is not for you. However, if your looking for a somewhere functional, central, good value for money with amazing staff - THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU.

The map we used continually during our 2 night break and was invaluable as we walked up and down endless canals, nooks and crannies!

In the room there was a fridge, small table with 2 chairs, fresh flowers on welcome, small bathroom with powerful shower. An added bonus within the room is a free (yes free!) safety deposit box. The breakfast was of a continental nature with croissants, cheeses, toast, orange juice and fruit, enough to fill us up for the many walking miles ahead! The breakfast bar was cosy and seats looking out over Wester Kerk and the canal made breakfast more romantic! The situation of the hotel is great too, a few metres away from Anne Frank house and within walking distance to other points of interest too.

Another personal touch we enjoyed is that the front desk regularly offered us free bottled water or sodas. The coffee and tea bar was open 24 hours. They allowed us a late check out and free luggage storage as well. A few points to mention are: the stairs leading up to the reception area are very steep. However, I have been to Amsterdam many times and have not stayed a hotel yet that does not have steep stairs. It is part of the architecture of the city.

It is centrally located, and while it is on a busy street, the neighborhood as a whole is relatively quiet and peaceful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walk to restaurants and cafes in the Jordaan as well as to the shopping in and around Dam Square. Our room at the Nadia was impressively small, but it was cozy and clean enough for a one-night stay in the city. Our balcony had a decent view of the Westerkerk, and it was an excellent spot for watching the busy Raadhuistraat below. Because the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a major road with auto and tram traffic, the room had a little bit of street noise at night---but with a fan running in the room, that noise was easily drowned out and we slept well. The Nadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast is served in a corner room with windows opening out on the surrounding neighborhood. The food was a usual Dutch breakfast---good but nothing fancy. What the Nadia lacks in spacious accommodations, it makes up for in excellent service. The staff was absolutely outstanding---friendly, helpful, welcoming, and good humored. When we arrived, we were offered a cold drink, and a porter helped carry our bags up the stairs to the front desk (the stairs, even by Netherlands standards, are long and steep); since we arrived early, before check-in time, we were able to drop our bags and go exploring; and we were also able to visit the house cats, Hello and Goodbye. Overall, the Nadia is probably best for short stays, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking primarily for a clean, comfortable place to crash and not a room to luxuriate in---it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good value.

Did't feel like spending a fortune on the accomodation but wanted to be central to be able to get lost on those little canals any time I felt like it :) How easy do you find it? I spoted it right from the tram. I asked the conductor wether the tram was goind to raadhuisstraat and she answered rather bored that ALL TRAMS GO THERE!!! (you stupid foreigner...just my comment). Feeling a bit discouraged I checked in and took a seat expecting 5-6 tramstops. And at a certain point I saw it: Nadia Hotel. I jumped at the next station, just 3 minutes away from the hotel, in a straight line accross a canal. With 2 pieces of luggage after me :))) What about the bloody stairs? OK, so the stairs require a healthy sense of humor. They are steep and many. You have to consider that in the past, they used to pay taxes according to how much surface a house occupied on the earth's crust and not according to its real surface. So of course they optimized everything on a vertical plane. The building is old and there is nothing you can do about it. I laughed when i first saw it, thinking about the frustrations it must induce sometimes. Really, take it as an amsterdamese joke and climb one step at a time. you'll be fine the rooms: I only know about mine. a single room with bed, tv, shower and table to put your lap top, wc, towels and flowers :) There were flowers in the room when I arrived and yes it does not make you more comfortable or better about the small space if you need space, but it was a nice gesture, and it spoke about the manager's and the staff's intent to make every guest's stay as pleasant as possible. So back to the room. It had all I needed. The walls are thin and yes there were some faint noises from other rooms but nothing kept me awake. This is the time of the soccer world cup and there are lots of bars around. but i had no problem with the noise. and now that i speak about the bars, do stop at sara's pancake place. have a pancake there, but if you ask for something spicy, be careful what you ask for. you will catch fire :))) loved it!!!! breakfast. no meat on any days, but I usually do not eat meat si I had no problem with that. I did miss my yougurt in the morning and one day i asked for a glass of milk and I was given one. the coffee is good. the cheese could be a little more diversified, I guess, but no real problem for me there either. keywords for the connnoissers: grasshopper, the bulldog ...

As other people have mentioned, the stairs to reception and the rooms are fairly death defying but the staff carry your bags up for you and the reception staff couldn't be more friendly, welcoming and helpful. The room was cosy but didn't feel cramped and there was loads of storage space. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and freshly tiled. I notice from some of the reviews here that they've had problems with the breakfast room being crowded but we never had this problem. Breakfast is from 7:30 - 10:30am and we were there both days about 8/8:30am and there was always space available. It seats about 30 people but maybe it gets busier later?? If we had anything less than favourable to say about the hotel, it would be that we had twin beds and each of the single beds were pretty narrow. If you're above average width you may struggle not to fall out of bed!! Also, we stored our bags for a late checkout on Sunday and unfortunately, my bag did get broken while in storage.

We were then given lots of leaflets etc with local information. The rooms are good for the price, although our room had a really odd bathroom. It was very small, and the shower area didn't have any sort of ledge ie like a wet room, but there was no gradient so water was flowing into the whole of the bathroom - we just stook a towel down and the water stayed away from the rest of the bathroom. Not too big a deal, and we didn't actually bother to complain. Only other thing was we could here people coming up the stairs on a night and early morning, nothing too bad though. However, our friends had a room around the corner, and they had none of these issues - no odd shower and heard no noise, so pot-luck really. Anyway, rooms are clean, staff are very friendly and helpful, breakfast is basic continental e.g. croissants, toast, juice, tea, coffee, cakes, yogs. It's in a good location, about 10 mins walk from dam square (other review said 4 mins...they must have sprinted there each morning), and a good 20 mins walk to Leidsplein. Another good point is that we arrived at 11am and they put our luggage into storage until we went back to the hotel at about 4pm. And then on the last day out flight was at 7pm, so they let us leave our luggage there until we wanted to pick it uplate afternoon.

The hotel is housed above shops and a delighful Italian restaurant on the canal side which we dined at a couple of times.

We came to Amsterdam for part two of our honeymoon. I'd asked for two single beds because I had been told (not by the hotel) that a \"double\" bed was just a big twin. The hotel, knowing that we were on our honeymoon, pushed the two twins together and had flowers for us in the room. In looking at previous TripAdvisor reviews, we knew the stairs were steep and the rooms small. Because we wanted a more authentic hotel rather than a large chain one, though, we were okay with this. The stairs are something else. We were lucky in that we only had to go half the flight to get to our room. They're steep and small, but we only had to climb them a few times daily. The staff carried our bags to our room, thankfully. The positives: the view onto the canal from room 4 is amazing. There's the canal, the bridge and a church all outside the window-the HUGE window. So, so pretty. The breakfast is perfect, yummy and included. The hotel feels cosy, the location is great, and the staff is polite. The negatives: we had to turn in the room key whenever we left and collect it upon return. Even though I trusted the staff and there was an in-room safe, this still made me uncomfortable. Not a negative for me, but more of an FYI: our room was a little noisy at night because we were near the street. It didn't disrupt our sleep though. The hallways are pretty noisy all day. The first full day, we asked for our room to be cleaned, but all we got were folded towels. The second day, we returned at 4:30 to cleaning supplies left in our room and towels and sheets all out of place. We had to wait in the breakfast room for at least 40 minutes for our room to be ready. During this time, three other guests also waiting with us were checked into their rooms. It smelled horrible when we returned to our room, but it was cleaner. The fire alarm went off two out of our three days at the hotel (I'm guessing because one of the rooms next to us was smoking even though the staff said it's non-smoking). The hallway often smelled like pot. Finally, we asked for a wake up call on the third day, and no one called. They did have the cab ready for us, though. Overall, for the price, I am happy with the hotel. This would not be the case had I not set my own alarm for wakeup, however, as I would have missed my flight.

It was so small I was sure that my husband and I wouldn't be able to both sleep in the bed, but we actually we did. Having said that, it did have everything we needed for our 2 night stay but I couldn't have managed another night. The toilet and shower room was so small it was only just possible to sit on the toilet and put your arms down by your sides! 2) The breakfast was also the smallest continental breakfast I have ever been offered in a hotel. Because we had pre-paid I made my husband eat the breakfast, but thank god there are lots of coffee shops and cafe's close by. 3) Garishly decorated and looked like the whole hotel needed a good scrub!

We left our bags in reception, had a drink on the house and was given a comprehensive map and guide to Amsterdam and off we went to explore. We did Ann Frank house, did lunch and then wandered back to the hotel.

Fridge, tv, bathroom with a fantastic shower, lots of hot water and fresh white sheets on the bed. Tea making facilities and it was just perfect. Afterall we only used the room as a base to shower change and sleep and we could not ask for anything more. The staff were great, so friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. We asked it we could have some ice in our room, yep ice we got, they really went that extra mile. Although it was a hotel I think the fact that it was small, personal and friendly it felt like we were spending the weekend at a mates house.

My friend and I booked a room with Hotel Nadia based on the positive reviews (location, price, cleanliness) we found on this site, however we were a little disappointed. On the positive side, the location is fairly good. The hotel is right on one of the inner canal rings; the dam and red light district are only blocks away, and you're easily within walking distance to any of the major museums or the Heineken Brewery, etc. But since the city is small, you could really stay anywhere in the city centre or the canal zones and be within walking distance of everything. Contrary to what other reviewers have stated, cafes and/or bars in the area around the hotel are either unremarkable or dead. The only other positive I could think of was the price, as this was one of the few centrally located hotels we could find with rooms under 100 euros/night, but you get what you pay for in the end. The stairs and room sizes were consistant with what other reviews have said, near vertically steep and claustrophobically small, but we knew that going in. What we didn't know was that the bathroom would be so small that the toilet is actually in the shower (pretty funny at first). Not sure about the sanitary aspect of this, but I certainly didn't feel clean in there. After using the shower, you couldn't go in the bathroom w/o shoes because the whole floor was flooded. But the biggest problem was the mold all over the disgusting bathroom walls. We told the front desk every day to have someone clean that up but nothing was ever done. Not sure what the problem was but they would appologize each day and then do nothing. Rest of the room was pretty clean, the beds and especially pillows could have been more comfortable but I've had worse. Also of note, we had requested a room away from the street noise but were given a room right on the street. The strangest thing about our stay was after returning to our room one day, we found that the room smelled like someone had taken a dump on the floor and the windows were wide open. It was so bad I asked to front desk if there was a sewage problem in the building! Housekeeping blew up our room! We had to leave the room for an hour and a half until it aired out. As for the breakfast, average at best. All in all, I wouldn't stay at this hotel again and I won't recommend this place to anyone. The lack of service and unclean bathroom override the location and price. If I wanted a dump, could have stayed somewhere else for half the price. If money is an issue, go with hostel; if not, go with nice B&B on a canal.

It's also along a beautiful canal, and as we had paid a lot, we got a great room with a lovely view of this. room #413 highly recommended - it has both a tiny balcony over the street corner (canal and big road view) and a window fully over the canal, with a desk in front of it and a cute duck-in wardrobe. small but very romantic. not box like. I did however find the traffic noise from the balcony occasionally quite bad, and when I experienced a different room for a night (right over the road like many of them) this was incredibly noisy - I needed ear plugs to block out the traffic (and I usually live in central London!), so i would advise paying more for a canal view room or the top floor (4th) to avoid this. the staff were charming - helped with bags, very welcoming, sorted all problems quickly and with a smile. breakfast was in a tiny room but great canal view and perfectly adequate space - nothing hot though to eat, only croissants, bread and cold cheese or jam, or cake. i could have done with toast in the freezing winter! the surrounding area feels very safe - easy to navigate home because of the church. only downside is the street has no nice cafes on it - a tacky little \"croissanterie\" which looks more like a kebab shop and we though had pretty cr*p food, and a very overpriced pancake place that burnt mine and still charged me 9 euros for banana and sugar! there's also a bagel chain which is similarly overprices. a \"coffee shop\" is nearby too but not one you'd want to linger in.

The room was tiny - just enough room for a bed and a wardrobe (with a safe) and for the door to open inwards, with a 14\" TV suspended over the foot of the bed and a fridge perched on a shelf above it, combined with a sliver of a wet room, wide enough to allow one person to move from shower to toliet and out again. On a cost per square foot basis, it was poor value compared to my Bruges and Paris hotels, but like I say, this could be the norm for the Dam and I wouldn't know. Onto the good stuff though - the service and the friendliness of the staff was excellent. I'd been warned that the steps from the entrance were steep - and they were! Having walked down from the Centraal Station in about ten minutes, the prospect of humping my bag up those vertiginous steps was awful - but I was rescued - the voice of Tess from the reception level on the first floor saved me - they had a system that carried your bag to your room while you calmed yourself in the breakfast room. That was wonderful. The bed was narrow and I needed a second pillow to make it a comfortable night - there was little room to stretch out. Downside - the walls were very thin, it would seem. I had the TV on very quietly but still got the ominous knocking from next door each of the three nights I stayed there. The breakfast was a little spartan - no cereals, just toast and croissants, juice, tea and coffee and mini-yoghurts. But overall, this was a decent spot to stay in the Dam - perhaps not the best value though.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "bucharest", "Title": "\u201cgood value for money\u201d", "Author": "123456000", "ReviewID": "UR48968588", "Content": "frendly staff, very clean and warm room, fantastic location, good breakfast.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bucharest", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, intimate and cosy room, wonderful service\u201d", "Author": "cocolica", "ReviewID": "UR48935023", "Content": "The location is perfect because it's in the centrum, but not in the middle of all it's noises.

We were greeted with bottled beverages and checked in - even to a canal facing room (advice to others to check availability when you book). Honestly, the living quarters are TIGHT! You have to maneuver a lot - to shower, to get your personal items out and then restore the luggage, but after awhile, it becomes routine and since we were out exploring the city most of the day, it was an ok place for budget travelers. The terrace was very relaxing. The breakfast was pretty nice - the corner room is really cute and the location is fantastic. We were called a cab to go back to the train station - which we were not overcharged on (he used a meter), and sent off with another departing beverage.

Okay, it is a 72-step climb to get to the typically small Dutch hotel room, but the outside balcony with the great view of the Westerkerk and the Keizergracht was well worth the climb. We arrived early on a rainy morning from the US, and at first, were taken back at the sight of the 36-step steep climb up the stairs to the reception area. We were relieved when a voice over the intercom instructed us to leave our luggage downstairs, and someone would carry it up for us. Once in the reception area, we were offered a complimentary drink - coffee/tea, water, soda, juice - which was greatly appreciated after a long flight. Our room wasn't ready yet, so we went off to explore Amsterdam in the dreary rain. When we returned, our luggage had been moved to our room and we were given the key to room 412. We climbed two more flights of stairs, 18 steps each, and were delighted when we opened the door and found a vase of fresh cut flowers brightening up our little room. Although the room was typically small, there was enough area to store our luggage and still have room for my husband to pace. There was a built-in counter desk with two chairs, and shelves which contained a television, mini-fridge, and a coffee/tea service. A closet at the other end of the room had a built-in safe. The bathroom was small, particularly the shower. The room was clean and nicely decorated. There were heavy black out curtains on the windows which helped with the street noise and light. But the best part of the room was the little covered balcony off the front of the hotel, on the Raadhuisstraat, overlooking the Westerkerk and the Keizergracht. We had to climb through the window/door to reach it, and it was large enough to accomodate three chairs, which was perfect since we were travelling with a friend. We thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the balcony, watching the city go by, protected from the rain. The breakfast room was nicely decorated and comfortable. Breakfast consisted of cheese, breads, rolls, jams & spreads, coffee/tea, juice, yogurt. We really enjoyed our two night stay at the Hotel Nadia, and the staff took excellent care of us. In fact, we ended up spending an additional night at the hotel, although it was in a different room. After a passport mix-up, we found ourselves stranded in Amsterdam at 10:00 on a Friday night, and we called the Nadia, and they were able to put us up for the evening in a triple room, complete with fresh flowers!

Hotel staff were very friendly (expecially the woman on the day shift), and when we arrived we were given a package of city maps and brochures.

However, hotel staff brought up our suitcases to the room when we checked in, and then brought them down to another room when we checked out at 10 a.m.- which was very handy as it allowed us to explore the city a bit more before our train left at 1 p.m. What I liked most: central location, smoke free facility, welcoming staff, room with plenty of places to hang clothes, lots of towels, and the ability to leave luggage in a separate room until check in (at 3 p.m.) or well after check out (10 a.m.) What I liked the least: all the stairs, but after two days I actually thought it added to the hotel's charm!", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cA real Gem !!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "martin068", "ReviewID": "UR41415851", "Content": "my husband and i enjoyed four nights at the Nadia Hotel.

Had it not been for the unfailing generosity, support and kindness of all the staff, I sincerely doubt I would have made it through to completion of my course. What is individual about the Hotel Nadia, and what makes this hotel so exceedingly special, is not the size of the rooms, some of which are indeed small, but it is the fact the people who run and manage this hotel on a day-to-day basis are instinctively kind and their only concern is that their guests are provided with all that they need. This kind of hospitality is not something that can be bought, nor is it something you can place 4 or 5 stars on, it is merely something that separates Hotel Nadia from the rest.

The location is very good, it's a nice neighbourhood with all the canals and historical canal houses, good little restaurants and cafes, shops, museums and other attractions, all within walking distance, and we certainly felt it very safe at any times. If you get a room with a canal view, you can just relax in your room between touring the city, and watch people and boats go by. I've often felt that it's boreing to just stay in the hotel room, but sometimes it's necessary to get a rest, and in this hotel it was fun due to the views and the people watching. Yes, the room was very small, but it was also functional. There was everything we could possibly need and we didn't feel crammed. Five days passed far too quickly.

Well, we were very pleasantly surprised. We walked with a couple of overnight bags from Central Station and found it very easily. As someone else mentioned - I was prepared for the stairs but was still shocked.. but its SOOOO Amsterdam and to be fair they look daunting but while they are steep they aren't too bad. Check in was delightful.. the woman behind reception offered to get someone to take our bags from the bottom of the stairs to our room and offered us a can of ice cold diet coke, 7up etc comlimentary - while they took our bags to our room. Our room was no. 4 and was half way down the stairs so not too bad to climb at all. We got to the room there was a lovely bouquet of flowers on the table with a note saying 'welcome, we hope you enjoy your stay' and found ourselves looking straight through 3 huge windows! out to a lovely canal and the beautiful Westerkerk Church. Yes the bells rang a bit but these are the same bells that Anne Frank heard (the Frank house is just a small block away) during their time in hiding and this is Amsterdam so we weren't expecting no noise. The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood and the stroll to Dam Square is only about 10 minutes but that is also far enough away from the crazyness (but hilarious-ness) of the red light district to be quite alot less busy and we weren't disturbed in the night.

I would say a few inches smaller than a normal single bed and I did feel like I was going to fall out a few times. Oh and another thing was the toilet roll.... really not what you would expect from a hotel... bit like school toilet paper... The breakfast was pretty good, breads, rolls, cheese, croissants, yogurts, coffee, tea, biscuits, jams, peanut butter, honey, apples etc... We certainly filled up enough and enjoyed it.. the breakfast room is very small but everyone seemed to get a seat and it does run from 7.30-10.30am so time for everyone.

Yes, Hotel Nadia has those stairs, but it is a true Canal house. The Hotel handles your bags, no need for you to drag them up. When you tour Amsterdam, you see the hundreds of canal houses, you can stay in one and see how the locals live. We had the quad room 3rd floor and it had the most lovely view of the canal and the Westerkirk. Another family member had a balcony room for 2 second floor and although a very small room, the balcony was terrific. I read a book about the Anne Frank house (the house is just around the corner) while lying in bed quad room with the Westerkirk church tower right out my window in full view. I came upon a photo in the book of the tower out the attic room window where Anne lived that was the exact view of the church tower but from a 90 degree turned angle. That is, I was looking at the west side and she the north side but identical view. Made goose bumps on my arms. Sheets clean and crisp, clean bathroom, no A/C but was cool with windows open and fan on. Nice breakfast, breads, juice, tea, coffee, cake, many jams, nuttell chocolate spread. Fresh flowers in the room. The walk to the city center Dam and then down to the train station area to do a canal boat tour took us down busy streets crowded with young people, and to our older eyes, strange people, but the strolls down the canals themselves were much calmer and more quite. I liked the city much better away from the Dam. Long walk to the flower market and on to the art museum was wonderful along the canals. Stopped for cafe meals. Sara's Pancake House two doors down from Hotel Nadia has wonderful crepes (pancakes - but not the american type) and great hot chocolate for a pm meal, open til 9:30pm.

In an earnest attempt to provide a balanced review to my fellow travelers I will do my best to provide my view of the pros and cons (from an American perspective). When you open the door to the Nadia Hotel prepare yourself to be greeted by perhaps the most astonishing set of stairs you have ever seen or will see. Really, there is not much difference in incline between these stairs and a ladder. The staff is prepared to assist you with your baggage up this monster and is quite expert at doing so. If you have a disability you will most likely want to stay somewhere else. There is really no way around this each time you come in the building (no elevator). The stairs take you up to a tiny lobby where you will be greeted by a gracious member of the staff. He or she will give you your room key, a complimentary beverage, and answer any questions whatsoever about the city that you might have. Every single person manning this desk during our stay was exceptionally kind and went out of his or her way to help us with our trip planning, be it calling the train station for us when we thought we had goofed up our tickets to Belgium, recommending a restaurant, which tram to take to a museum, etc. As a side note you pick up your room key when you enter the building and drop it off again with the front desk when you leave, presumably to minimize lost keys. Making your way from the lobby to your room is also interesting due to the narrow dimensions of the hallways. Only one person/piece of luggage at a time might proceed. When you open the door to your room you will see the tiny theme continues with your Lilliputian accommodations. This is definitely the smallest room I have ever stayed in before. The bathroom is similar in size and setup to the bathroom you find in an RV. The sink is raised about two inches higher than the toilet and shower, which is good because the shower is on a flat plane, even with the toilet. The water seeps out from under the curtain and floods the general area around the toilet while showering. This is partially due to the fact that the shower drain was somewhat clogged but I can't complain because I never mentioned it to the management and on second thought I wish I had so they would have a fair chance to fix the problem. The bed was comfortable and the down comforter quite thick and warm, but there were two holes in the cover. The major minus to the room is the lack of control you have over the temperature- we never saw any way to make the room cooler (or warmer in winter....). Fortunately a fan is provided and we left the balcony door open at night with the fan in front to blow in cool air. You will have to request house keeping if you want them to come every day, otherwise we noticed a frequency of about an average of every other day. None of this is particularly troubling to us as we came to Amsterdam mainly to see the sights and not be in our room. The one incredible plus to our room was the marvelous balcony. A few evenings we were back relatively early and able to take advantage of this wonderful feature. It was made especially wonderful by the fact that there is still light until 11:00 or 11:30 at night in Amsterdam in June. From our balcony we could see a beautiful church tower and one of the canals. Directly across from us was Jennifer's Croissanterie, a lovely place to pop in for a pastry, sandwich, cappuccino, etc. I often did just so to augment my breakfast from the hotel. The breakfast room was charming and offered a wide range of breakfast items, but unfortunately no good sources of protein other than cheese and sweetened yogurts. I would have loved some hard boiled eggs to supplement the bread and croissants. Our location in general was excellent. The Anne Frank house was just out of sight across the street, the post office was two blocks in one direction and an inexpensive Internet cafe one block in another. The Red Light district and Dam Square were about a 10 minute walk away, Central Station just a bit further up the road. A couple trams and buses a short walk from the hotel would take you to Central Station as well, further simplifying your movements around the city. I would stay here again, indeed I dream of returning some day.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SG", "Title": "\u201cLovely Place with very hospitable and thoughtful staff\u201d", "Author": "alithia", "ReviewID": "UR32931543", "Content": "We received a warm welcome from the staff there immediately upon arrival at Hotel Nadia.

From the moment we stepped into the hotel, we could tell that this place was something special. You need to ring the bell to get into the building, but the bellhop was at the door quickly to help us bring our luggage up the steps to the reception. Yes, the steps are steep (and pictures don't do them justice), but we found this to be the norm in all of Amsterdam. The staff was the most hospitable of all the hotels during our trip, offering a welcome drink and flowers in the room. They were always quick to offer us tips and advice on the town's attractions. The resident cats, Hello and Goodbye, are also a treat. They have their own little nook, and greeting them each morning after breakfast was a great way to start off the day. Don't expect big, modern facilities if you stay here. This is a small, cozy hotel with a lot of charm. The bathroom can be a bit small for larger people, but the average person should find it enough. Do note that besides a curtain the shower is not separate from the rest of the bathroom. Everything in there will get wet. This can be strange to Americans that are used to having spacious, modern facilities but it really isn't as bad as people make it seem and isn't uncommon for Amsterdam's hotels. Just bring some rubber flip flops and remember that you're traveling through Europe to broaden your horizons, not to restrict them. The location is great as well. The hotel is a block away from the Anne Frank house (highly recommended), a 3 minute walk from a large Albert Heijn supermarket (those sit-down restaurant bills add up!), and 5 minutes away from bustling Dam Square. In conclusion, if you're looking for a big, modern hotel like you're used to in America, this place is not for you.

From the Central train station, we took the #5 tram to the Dam stop (you may also take the #1 or #2). From the Dam stop, the hotel is about a 5 minute walk. The hotel is located on the fringe of the Jordaan neighborhood. It is also only a 2-minute walk from the Anne Frank museum. I liked the location because it was quiet at night and at the same time, it was not too far from the train station and major sights. It is a bit of a hike to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum but the tram makes getting around extremely easy and convenient. Before boarding the tram, buy a strippenkart. It costs about 8 euros and comes with 15. The strip may be shared. A single trip within the city center costs 2 tickets. You can use the same tickets if you transfer to another tram or bus within 60 minutes of validating them. The hotel is fantastic for budget travelers. Breakfast is included and it is typical of breakfasts on the continent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coffee, tea, juice, bread, cheese, croissants, ham, etc. Our double room included a safe, mini-fridge (no mini-bar), as well as coffee & tea making facilities.

We informed the front desk and they spent 15 minutes helping us until we were able to get online. They even called us later to confirm that the internet was still working for us. One morning, I called the front desk at around 8am to ask about laundry service. Within 5 minutes, someone had come up to the room to retrieve my laundry.

The hotel is in a great location - not only just round the corner from the Anne Frank House, but also close to the pedalo rental place. If you haven't tried it, do, if you have nice weather. You get a really good view of the canals, can go down little canals that the big tours can't get through, and can take your time. Probably better on a weekday rather than a weekend, as traffic on the canal gets busy on the weekend and you can spend a lot of time avoiding the big boats. If you don't want to walk to the museums (though they are only about 20 minutes if you take the direct route along the canal) you can get a tram.

Our main criteria for choosing the hotel, based on the reviews we read, were the relatively inexpensive price, and the access to the tram from the train station and airport. It is right off the #15, (and possibly #13) tram line, very easily accessed if you are hauling luggage around. It is also only about 4 blocks from the red light district, and even closer to the Anne Frank house, so very conveniently located. The Van Gogh museum is a bit further away. The hotel itself is very unique, and quaint, a bit quirky even. When entering through the front door, first you have to ring the bell and they will buzz you in. Then you scale approximately 40 narrow stairs straight up, which we had no problem with, it was kinda fun, or funny, but I could see an issue for elderly or handicapped guests. They may have accommodations to help if needed, but before staying, you might want to check that out. Amsterdam, in general, doesn't seem very handicap accessible, so be prepared. The staff was very friendly to us, although we didn't really have any special requests, and they did have flowers for us in the room upon arrival. They gave us a quadruple room even though we didn't ask for it, which had a double bed, and two singles. The room was quite cozy in size, I am wondering what we would have gotten if we only had a double room. The room was not modern by any means, but hey, its in a building probably a couple hundred years old. The bed linens were crisp and clean, very luxurious for this class of hotel, so that was nice. There was some noticeable noise from the locals on the street at night, but we were jetlagged enough that it didn't keep us from sleeping. Breakfast was included in the cost of the room, but wasn't much more than bread products, jelly, and coffee, maybe some juice I cant really remember. In all, I would say Hotel Nadia exceeded my expectations at about $70 US per night, just don't set your expectations for a 4 or 5 star hotel.

Our room was as expected-very much like a very small sea-going accommodation. Since we travel with one piece of luggage and a shoulder bag each, the shelving and storage easily accommodated our stuff. We quickly got used to the combo shower/wc. Our room was spotless and remained so during our stay. The breakfast room was cozy but with terrific service . Table were kept spotless. If you are a traveler who likes space and an elevator to your floor the Nadia will be lacking. However, if you can handle the stairs and tiny accommodation, the wonderful staff will make the Nadia a worthwhile booking.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "LisaLibrarian", "ReviewID": "UR32149841", "Content": "Convenient location.

However, having read the previous reviews coupled with the excellent price of approx \u00c2\u00a390 for two nights, my three friends and I booked up in good faith, and we were certainly not disappointed! On arrival, the stairs looked an absolute nightmare, but actually weren't too bad at all. Thankfully there are handrails! It was a laugh if nothing else trying to get up and down them. Wouldn't recommend for people with walking difficulties, but then I'm sure you knew that already. We booked two rooms and made a few special requests. We had previously emailed our requests several times although never received a response; I can understand why now though, the staff are clearly too busy catering to the guests once they arrive in the hotel, something which, after staying there, you can totally forgive them for! When we arrived we were greeted by a nice gentleman in reception. He took note of our request for twin rooms and a balcony if possible. We also asked that the rooms were close to each other. He did brilliantly with all our requests and we were very happy to get one room with a balcony (and chairs) which meant we were able to smoke without having to trek the stairs each time. There is a balcony in the breakfast room but it is only big enough for one or two people and there are no chairs so you should request a room with balcony if you wish to smoke. I really can't say enough about the staff at this hotel. They blew me away with their generosity and kindness. Every time we went through reception we were given a drink on the house, and actual cans and bottled drinks too, no cheap rubbish here! We arrived back late one night and the man who was on reception (I think he was the manager) was just brilliant. So friendly and willing to cater to anything we wanted. Amazing customer service! As for location, it's fabulous, very close to Dam Square. The only small thing I would have to say, and I can't even call this a complaint because it did not matter to my holiday one bit. The toilet / shower area in the rooms is absolutely tiny! But that's it, that's my only thing and it didn't put me off. I will definately be staying at the Nadia if I return to Amsterdam. If only for the staff and service alone. I can honestly say I have stayed in 4* hotels and not been treated half as well as we were at Nadia.

We could see the Anne Frank House from our room, so it's not a great distance to go to this Museum. We also had a nice view of the canal. You are within walking distance to many Amsterdam's tourist destinations. The stairs are daunting (steep climb and many of them). You will be fine as long as you don't have mobility issues.

What makes this hotel stand out is the attention to service such as complimentary drink upon arrival and access to tea/coffee 24 hours a day. The hotel manager and reception acknowledged that we were returning visitors straight away, and even spoke about the room type we had previously booked. Now I am sure he did not remember us from the year before, but had made the effort to look up our previous booking and make us feel like he appreciated our repeat custom. The manager was away on our departure, but he called us to say thank you again and offered us a departure drink, now that is what I call service, which you do not get now-a-days especially from large hotels. This time we got a twin balcony room on the first floor. I am sure you have read from other reviews that the rooms are compact (fine by me as I do not spend much time in them) so having a balcony for a bit extra makes the room feel a bit larger. We went on a 1 hour canal cruise from the pier by central station which was nice. There are different companies and the price varies quite drastically. The Lovers cruise which is recommended in many guide books was 14 Euros, but we ended up going on a cheaper cruise next to Lovers for 8 Euros. The boats themselves did not look much different so I assume the commentary on Lovers must have been the reasoning for such a large price difference. The commentary on our cruise was pretty rubbish in English, but it was nice to sit on a cruise and see the views as it is a beautiful city. Food wise, I would recommend Gaucho which is just off Dam Sq. It is a bit costly (30 Euros for main and a glass of coke), but when you can cut steak with a normal knife (as opposed to a steak knife) you know it is good. Ask for a window seat on first floor - very romantic.

We really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam and appreciated the warm welcome from everyone at the Nadia Hotel. The drinks at the top of the stairs were a very-appreciated thought. We were parched after lugging our luggage from Centraal station and the fresh flowers in our room, such a nice touch. They brought our luggage up for us, which was essential, as I don't think I could have done it. I hope they use some kind of machine, because the stairs are steep and I don't envy whoever has the job without some kind of mechanism. The attention to these kind of details make this hotel such a treat! The location couldn't be better and the manager went out of his way to help us find our way around the city. They have large maps on the walls to help you get oriented and then give you more versions to take with you so you won't get lost in the old town where the houses all look similar and the street names can be confusing for travelers. I would only say two things that crossed my mind on entry to our room: \"How would we get out in case of fire?\" and \"What is the carbon foot print of the hotel when the heat is cranked high in an empty room? This is not just about the Nadia. Many hotels we stayed in have these issues. It is a challenge to retro-fit such things as fire exits, I suppose, but it does give one peace of mind to see them. Also, it seems to be a common thing to crank up the radiator even with no one in the room. A little heat on a cold day is okay, but it was so hot we had to open the window, and I felt guilty about that. (The view from the balcony was terrific, though!) We loved the breakfast. It was plentiful and delicious and on offer early if you need it. Very much appreciated. I searched through many, many hotels on trip advisor before our trip and this one was well worth the search. I hope to return soon to Amsterdam with my family and enjoy this place again. Hint: Trams run early and late, so if you don't like the noise, ask for a room at the back.

The price is excellent and the location 3 blocks from Dam Square with a tram stop on the next block was very convenient. Plenty of good restaurants within a 10 minute walk, good cafes all around the neighborhood (Cafe Kolkhaven and Het Schuim became favorites). The staff was very helpful with dining recommendations and even booked a table for us at a restaurant that we had selected ourselves on our last night in town. The places they recommended were all very good as well. A highlight of the trip for me was going to the UEFA cup match between Ajax Amsterdam and Olympique Marseille and the manager was extremely helpful. I bought the tickets online and had them delivered to the hotel before I arrived, he accepted delivery and kept the tickets safe until I arrived, giving them to me as soon as I checked in. He also emailed me at home to tell me that he had received the tickets for me. On the day of the game he helped with directions on how to get to the game. My wife's birhtday came the week we were there, I swear everybody on the staff wished her a happy birthday and they even had fresh flowers sent to the room. The cleaning lady went as far as to give her a big and genuine happy birthday hug. I can say only good things about the service. The location is excellent. The price was also very good. My only warning is that the rooms are small, so if you need a large room then the Nadia is not the place for you.

A young man is stationed in the hall outside of the reception area at the top of the stairs, and he'll bring your suitcases to your room. The pluses: We find that the most pleasing hotels are small family-operated hotels such as the Nadia because they provide more genuine hospitality and know their guests personally. We felt as if we were singled out as VIP guests until we realized that all guests are VIPs here. Guests enjoy a welcome drink in the well-decorated breakfast room (see photo) with a view of the Western Church and Keizer's Canal. Guests will return again to the room for a continental buffet breakfast including a delicious processed Belegen cheese, yoghurt, juices, coffee, fresh fruit, and rolls. Most of the guests were couples or groups of single ladies. Perhaps because it was low season in March, we were upgraded to a beautiful room on the top floor with a view of the canal and the Westerkirk church. Osam, the manager, provided shopping and other recommendations pointing out locations on an aerial photo of central Amsterdam, which was better than a map because it showed landmarks. Free wi-fi in each room was fast and reliable. Osam said that he distributed routers in a dense pattern throughout the hotel so every room would have a strong signal. The bathroom in our top floor room 413 was small but adequate. The room also had a very small porch overlooking Radhuisstraat and a small crouch-in closet. Once you crouch and enter, you'll find the closet quite spacious. The TV was small, facing the bed. The refrigerator was so efficient that the freezer froze our ice pack. My wife and I felt the canal-side view and decoration made the room quite romantic. Sounds from the street were not bothersome. The hotel is in a very convenient area, a short walk from the Dam and central post office, across the street from a boat bus stop, right next to a major tram stop, and at the north end of the Nine Little Streets (Die Negen Straatjes) shopping area. It also is within walking distance of Jordaan. There are many good restaurants nearby. The staff recommended and made a reservation for us at a nearby Dutch cuisine Restaurant where the prices were right. The minuses Westerkirk bells ring, but they did not bother us. Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the stairs. Really, we thought nothing of the stairs after our first climb except that they made the Nadia Hotel more special, more apart, and more romantic. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 70 years old and out of shape, so if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the stairs, nobody should.

Please read whole review. First off I will get the negatives out of the way. When the front door opens you have 37 very steep steps to climb, they are very vertical but you are told this on the website. And when we arrived we were told to leave our cases at the bottom so that the porter could bring them up which he did very promptly. The rooms are small but again that is stated on the website. Now for the good points. This was the most friendly hotel I have stayed in. We arrived early and were given a welcome drink, a map of amsterdam and a whats on guide. Whilst drinking our coffee they rang thru to the breakfast room to say they had a room ready for us which we checked straight into. The room whilst being small had everything in it, including a mini fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, tv and safe. We were very lucky to be upgraded to a balcony room at the front of the hotel with side views over the canel and westerkerk (church),(be warned it can be noisy, but we live on a main road so didn't affect us). The room was very clean, the bedsheets were very clean and very white. The room was cleaned daily and hygiene was very high. The breakfast was just enough with toast, pastries, cheese, cake, juice and hot drinks available, all included in the price. All the staff were respectful and helpful, giving you advice and directions to everywhere we wanted to go. The hotel location is fantastic, 5 mins from dam square, so was very local to the city centre and the tram stops. I would have given the hotel 5 stars but for 2 reasons I'm not. One is the size of the rooms and the other is that there is no bar here and I like a nightcap when I come in at night before I retire to bed. Having said that there is a pub opposite the church about 50 yards up from the hotel. So in summary, a fantastic friendly hotel in the centre of amsterdam which is value for money. I would reccommend this hotel and certainly stay here again. I love amsterdam, it has great culture, great architecture, great history but doesn't take itself to seriously. The red light district is fun to walk round, the coffeshops fun to try.

The staff are all really friendly and helpful - I was chatting to Osam the owner and mentioned that ,when I lived in the Middle East, I liked to smoke shisha (not drugs I hasten to add) - the next day he had arranged with Ali (one of his staff) to bring in his shisha pipe from home so that I could have a puff. Unfortunately, because we'd arranged to meet up with our friends who were also staying at the hotel, we could only have 15 minutes talking to Ali and enjoying the shisha. I see one of our party has already commented on the lovely restaurant they arranged for us on the Friday night (Haesje Claes), and the Pancake House and Struisvogel restaurant.

The room was always clean and comfortable with plenty of hot, running water for showers. Osam was \"on it\" every second, and attended to every request for all hotel guests . As soon as he was able, he upgraded one of our rooms to a quiet, canalside double with a view of the famous West Church. It was a special room - again with fresh flowers.

Before considering the Hotel Nadia you must consider Amsterdam as a whole. It is a vibrant beautiful city but not the most accessible at times. If you are deciding on which hotel to stay at and are concerned about the size or layout of the hotel then you simply must realise that this is Amsterdam and everything is condensed. With that in mind on with the review.... The Hotel Nadia is quite simply the most friendly hotel we have ever stayed in anywhere in the world. The staff are always approachable and will always greet you with a friendly hello. Nothing is too much to ask from them and they have given us some great advice and help over the years. When you arrive at the Hotel you will be greeted not only by a friendly member of staff but also a daunting stairway up into the main reception area. I can not sum up just how daunting the stairs are at first but as mentioned before this is Amsterdam and everywhere is like that here. But I promise you that you do get used to the stairs and the staff are always willing to shuttle your luggage up for you. Once you are up the stairs you are greeted with a complimentary drink (much needed!) We were also greeted in our room by a fantastic bouquet of flowers welcoming us back \"home\" and its really apt as staying here is like staying with friends more than staying in a hotel. The rooms are small (again like most hotels in Amsterdam) but furnished wonderfully with some really quirky features. Everything you need in your room is there (Shower, WC, Fridge, Safe, TV with tons of channels etc) but the best rooms are ones with a balcony as the view is tremendous as you can see the stunning Westerkerk from your room but also the canal that runs alongside the building. The location is perfect as its central enough to make most important sights a mere five minute walk (Anne Frank House, Red Light District, Dam Square) and also slap bang in the middle of two supermarkets and a load of little cafes and restaurants that are also reasonably priced as they are slightly off the beaten track. There are also some lovely boutique shops two minutes away along the canal. It is the safest hotel we have ever stayed in too, Amsterdam can be quite boisterous at times what with stag weekends etc but thankfully Nadia is a family hotel that avoids the usual tourist groups due to its location. The hotel manager is also a great security plus in the hotel as he is a lovely man but you certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get on the wrong side of him!! Breakfast is more than acceptable offering coffee, juices, teas, bread, toast, croissants and various cakes. The breakfast room itself is a sight to behold as it is beautiful. We have dietary requirements when staying in a hotel and this was and never has been a problem for us in the Nadia. All in all I have nothing to say other than good things about the Hotel Nadia. If you are looking for a flashy sterile five star hotel then this probably isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the place for you. But if you are looking for a safe, reasonably priced friendly hotel with awesome five star staff and a wonderful location then I strongly suggest booking the Nadia ASAP. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book it when we want to stay here because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we could ever stay anywhere else even if it was a five star hotel for free! We would miss the staff here far too much and it would feel like we were cheating on them!

So we decided to do something completely different this year -and we are very glad we did! From the moment we arrived the welcome was very warm and friendly. Nothing seemed too much trouble for the staff. They are cheerful and helpful without being intrusive and the manager (or owner?) has a good sense of humour. The hotel is full of character and had been beautifully decorated for Christmas especially the lovely breakfast room - one real plus for me is that tea or cofee are available at any time, in the breakfast room or in your rooms. I wish there could be milk in little jugs though rather than the individual creams/whitener in foil containers but that's such a small thing. The rooms are small but perfectly comfortable and ours had a lovely canal view, with two churches also in view - one which played it's bells on the hour every hour - very quaint and Christmassy!! Dam square is just around the corner - the hotel is in the perfect position for exploring Amsterdam. We packed a lot into our four days there - Anne Frank House, Van Gogh museum, The ice cafe (not worth it) The Amsterdam Dungeon experience and ice skating outside on Christmas Day in Liedsplein square to name a few. The hotel staff recommended and booked us a lovely place to eat on Christmas day and we also found a really good Spanish tapas bar/restaurant called Casa Don Pedro just along the road. If you like Spanish food go here - it was excellent. This hotel is well worth the price we paid and we will visit again. In fact my son is planning to return in February! Oh yes - I nearly forgot - the resident cats, 'Hello' and 'Goodbye' were also one of the highlights!

The woman working the reception desk when we arrived was warm and helpful, and our bags were waiting in our room for us by the time we finished checking in. Our room was very small but the wardrobe and plentiful shelving made it feel bigger. The lighting and decor were both very cute -- overall it was incredibly cozy and comfortable, and it could not have been cleaner (same for the bathroom). The breakfast room was delightful, too -- especially since it was decorated for Christmas. There were several ladies working to make sure there was also fresh coffee and juice. The entire staff were always friendly and helpful -- they helped us arrange for a shuttle service to the airport at the end of our visit, and helped us down with our bags. Security at the hotel is very good -- they monitor the always-locked front door via camera and don't allow in anyone who is not a registered guest, so you can be comfortable that there's never anything too shady going on in the rooms around you. The hallways smelled pretty strongly of cigarette smoke at times, which didn't bother us since our room never smelled smoky at all. But people who are extremely sensitive to cigarette smoke might be bothered. Our room was on the interior side of the building (not directly exposed to the street) so outside sound was no problem whatsoever. I do think the walls between the rooms and the hallway must be very thin, because we could hear people passing by and/or talking in the hallway very clearly. It was never particularly bothersome but if we had visited at a more crowded time of year it might have gotten annoying. Though you can always sleep with earplugs. The location could also not have been better -- it is very close to Dam Square but just enough out of the bustle and mayhem that you are able to really relax.

It is, essentially, a small hotel that appears to be family run and is not directed toward the business traveller. There is no doorman at the curb and there is no place to stop your car an unload. I imagine most guests arrive by train and walk or take a cab or bus from the station. We had a car but did not want to have access to it. The hotel contacted a car park service and charged us 50 Euro for two nights. The hotel is well situated for those who want to tour the town. It is located between two of the inner canals and one side of the hotel faces the canal and the other faces a major arterial for the city center. The Jordaan neighborhood is quite close as is Dam Square, the Anne Frank House and other attractions. Great shopping and restaurants are nearby. The main street in front of the hotel is a little shabby but very busy with trams, traffic and pedestrians. There are two or three other even more modest hotels in the same building. You have to find the sign and ring the bell to be buzzed in. The hotel lobby is two flights up a very steep staircase. The staff is helpful and insisted on grabbing our suitcases and pulling them up the stairs. The lobby is very small and is not an area where you would hang out. The manager offered us a beverage (bottled water, can of coke etc.) from a fridge as we checked in. The hotel restaurant is on the same level as the lobby and it has a view over the canal and the Western Church. The food was good and plentiful but the room was a little cramped for the number of guests at the hotel. Our room was very small but it had a great balcony overlooking the main street with a view to the canal. I have posted several photos. The hotel does have free wifi and basic television.

The charming little kitchen (with a balcony and overlooking the canal), serves breakfast from 7:30 to 10:30. Breakfast was something we never missed as it made dining so much more enjoyable.

We arrived early so our room wasn't ready but the Nadia is more than happy to look after your belongings until your room is available. Be advised, like many hotels in Amsterdam, the Nadia has very steep stairs and no lift, but once again the hotel staff insist on carrying your cases up and down any stairs for you, making life much easier. Remember to leave your cases at the bottom of the stairs when you first arrive (reception is on the first floor) and they will collect them for you. The hotel is very well situated. It is directly across the street from Westekerk (near Anne Frank's house) and trams stop there regularly throughout the day (although Amsterdam is best experienced by foot - there are some great finds down the little side streets) It is a few minutes walk to some of the best shopping areas in the city. Our modest room was very clean, comfortable and had everything we would need for our three night stay. Breakfast (breads cheese, cakes, croissants, yoghurt, juice and tea or coffee) takes place in a lovely balcony breakfast room where again the staff are very helpful and friendly. We celebrated our first wedding anniversary while we were there and the staff left a beautiful bouquet of flowers for us - we believe it is the touches like this that make a hotel stand out amongst the rest and helped to make our stay so enjoyable.

The safe was covered in dust and so was the fan, and the carpet did not look like it had been vacuumed since it has been opened. 3) The size of the room- you could not fully open the door as it hit the desk, and you couldn't even get your case through! The walkway between both beds was literally a matter of inches. 4) The beds: One's mattress was larger than the base so that it pushed you out of bed and forced you onto the floor due to such worn springs. The other was literally hanging out of the window and the blanket got lost down the gap! They seemed itchy and infested- the place felt alive with bugs and no matter how long you spent in the shower, you didn't feel clean 5) The \"breakfast\" consisted of cold bread, crackers, and cake.

It was by chance that we get an available room. I've passed by the hotel site after reading some reviews here and tried to do a reservation. Unfortunately there was no room available and I went for another hotel (believe it or not, almost the double of the price with no taxes included and no breakfast). Just two or tree days before our trip I've received an e-mail from Nadia Hotel saying that, If I was still interested they had a double room with a balcony available for me. In that precisely moment we decided to cancel the other reservation and sign in with Nadia. It was our best move in the all Amsterdam trip. We arrived Nadia near midnight. Ringed the bell and immediately the door was opened and we saw the famous stairs. Before we could start climbing Mr. Osama, the manager, told us from upstairs to leave the luggage down. As we signed in he gave us all the maps and paper infos that someone could ever need about the city. He also told us to grab a drink from the little freezer on the reception and we went to the breakfast room waiting while the luggage was carried for the room. It was nice to be in the first floor but even if it was on the top one, the stairs are not so bad as some people say. Our room was the 205. Not a big room. A small one to be honest but hey, more than enough for us. A double bed, a small tv, a small freezer, a safe over the closet, a table and some tea and coffee facilities. Also a small (well, very tinny) bathroom. Once again, more than enough. Everything was very clean and the heat was already on (that night was a little bit cold out on the street). While my wife was undoing the bags I was already turning on my laptop and in a minute connecting to the Internet trough the free wi-fi from the Hotel. And no, it was not some bad line divided by all the rooms. Nadia seem to have a router for each floor allowing a hi-speed connection everywhere. I know that some people are hunger for huge hotel rooms. We don't. There are some specifications that are essential for us: Private bathroom, clean, the most central possible in our destinations. We usually just go to the hotel to bed, bath and nothing more so Nadia had everything we wanted . Next morning we went for the lovely breakfast room and yes, once again we thought how lucky we could get. For all those who say that Nadia offers a basic breakfast I just can say: define basic. If basic means no read beans and fried bacon with eggs ok but I really think I could not eat that kind of things in the morning. Instead Nadia breakfast had everything I use to have at my own house making me feel at home: Several different kinds of bread, toasts and croissants, several jelly's and butter, Nutella and big slices of a delicious cheese. They also have a wonderful cake to go with the coffee, the tea or the hot milk. All this and the view from the breakfast room windows just gave us a great start every morning. What more can I say? We just loved this little hotel. All the staff is of a extreme sympathy from Mr. Osama to the blond girl (that I cannot recall the name) passing by everyone else. One afternoon when we arrived at the Hotel Mr. Osama saw me with the camera and told me if I would like to go up to the roof and take some photos. That day was not possible for me but he remember it the next day and just before checking out I went there with my wife and indeed that was a view... This review is to long already but I must say that, if I ever go back to Amsterdam, I'll stay at Nadia Hotel.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sofia", "Title": "\u201cSpring in Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "lily_of_the_valley66", "ReviewID": "UR15742548", "Content": "We've been in NADIA-Amsterdam only for 4 days, but this hotel is like a fairy-tale with polite and friendly staff.

Only some fresh fruits may add to the menu. During our stay I was pleased at all modern conveniences in room. Although it was a small room everithing was perfect: clean and quiet!

The room was more like a corridor and there was no wardrobe or anywhere else to put clothes. My bed was pressed right up against the window, my husband was right up against a wooden partition - we had a 6\" gap between the beds and it was impossible to walk in the room unless one or other of us went into the en-suite bathroom or sat on a bed. I think the room would be impossibly hot during the summer months, and we were unable to open the window except for about 1\" at the top. There was a very small fan that was placed high up on a shelf and had no effect whatsoever. (A word of caution - if offered the key to room 7 have a look first before you decide). The stairs were certainly VERY steep but not too much of a problem and if I was strictly honest the plusses probably just about out-weighed the minuses.

I would like to ensure the stair is not difficult to hike :D because My father who is 70 up can walk up easily. The funny thing is the stair is narrow and steep enough to have the stop area in between for traffic jam. We had 3 rooms which all were good.

We could also walk to the dam. There is a supermarket near by. The guests were also nice and not kind of party lovers which means the air and atmosphere in the hotel is clean and look safe. The breakfast were adequate, juice coffee bread cheese and sweetness. However, the breakfast room is lovely, even though, it is small comparing to the hotel scale. For those who like the view, may sit in front of the windows and sip coffee. The staffs are nice and informative. Service mind is what they inhibit. Keep on going, thumbs up. One of the thing is that you have to listen to tram running and ringing bell from church once in a while. Near the hotel while you are walking direction to the dam, a few step aways before you reach the first intersection, you would found a souvenir shop which also sell cigarette and beer.

Travelling from Nova Scotia, Canada, we arrived, and as advised, our bags were taken immediately to our awaiting room - 4th floor (top floor). We were greeted with a free non-alchohol beverage and very warm smiles. After a tour of the breakfast room, we were advised our room was ready. We were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary and my husband casually mentioned this when booking the hotel, late in 2007. Though we didn't send a reminder, there was a fresh flower bouquet with a \"Happy Anniversary\" message from the Nadia. That was the first of many surprises. Our room was small, but the celings were very high, there was plenty of shelving and a closet. There was also an in room safe. The room was immaculately clean. Our bedspread had the most terrific message - \"Lounge\". We had a balcony, which was a wonderful added touch -like another room altogether. The breakfast was a perfect start to the day - a variety of breads/pastry and cheese - tea/coffee/orange juice. Lots of choice for spreads - loved the nutella and croissants - and the coffee - Wow! The in room fridge was put to good use as was the in room kettle and tea supplies. There was a very powerful fan, for any one who likes to partake in the \"greenery\" of Amsterdam - this worked well to keep our room smelling fresh. The bathoom was also extremely clean, and the shower was powerful and HOT! Just the way I like it. The cleaning staff was excellent, even calling our room to make sure everything was okay. The customer service desk was open 24 hrs/day - with a \"buzz to get in\" rule, it is best to get a 24 hr hotel instead of one that will put a curfew on your evening out. Yes, it was rough to walk up four flights of stairs after a full day of walking but it was so satisfying to get up there and take a load off. I would recommend this hotel to any one who is able to handle the stairs. I must assume though, that a lot of the hotels in the area would have the same steep stairs.

The most recent trip was my second time at the Nadia, and I enjoyed it as much as the first time! A few observations, plusses and minuses It's about 10 mins walk from the Dam and all the sights and sounds around there. It's less than 10 minutes to the Anne Frank House and other sights in that area. It's on the tram route for the Rembrantplein and the Zoo. The staff couldn't be friendlier and more helpful - from carrying bags upstairs, offering (non-alcoholic) drinks on arrival, providing maps & event guides, and making reservations for the hotel/airport shuttle, they couldn't do enough. The rooms are small, but comfortable and had all amenities - I was in a single room on the top (4th ) floor, and had a good size bed, ensuite with shower, TV, tea/coffee making facilities, safe and chair & desk. The room was spotless, and housekeeping called every day to make/change bed, clean bathroom, etc. The building is old and quirky - so you won't get a sterile square box to stay in. You may hear next door watching TV or....(well, it is Amsterdam!). You may hear your neighbours who've stayed out later than you coming home, saying goodnight and heading to bed. Yes, there are a lot of steep steps and no lift, so don't wear high heels and don't get too drunk while out for the evening! The staff will carry cases up and down, just ask! I asked for a non-smoking room, and was told they're in short supply - but I got one, so didn't have any difficulties mentioned by another reviewer. General noise - I was at the back of the hotel, so heard very little outside noise. Remember that you're in the middle of a city, which doesn't sleep, so noise is to be expected. I spent 4 nights here this time, and was very happy with the experience. Two tips - get the Conexxion hotel shuttle from Schipol to the door of the Nadia. Return fare is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21 and well worth the trip. You'll be dropped at the door, and the hotel will book the return trip for you. - Cafe Panorama, at the other end of the block is a nice place to eat (Italian pasta/pizza and steak).", "Date": "March 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "Sena2005", "ReviewID": "UR14031744", "Content": "Our room was very, very, small, but very clean and with a great canal view.

My first visit was in June when I booked a city break through a Travel Agent. I made my subsequent bookings on-line direcly with the Hotel. On the first visit I took a taxi from the Airport which cost about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40-00. The next time due to busy traffic and taking an alternative route that turned out to be equally busy cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70-00. Third Time I took Train to Central Station for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6-80. My first thoughts on arrival was:- there's the sign for the Nadia Hotel but where is it? The Taxi Driver rang the doorbell and when the door opened I was was a bit taken aback to see a really steep narrow stairway ahead of me. Maybe someone knew that the 39 Steps is one of my favourite films. Having overcome the intial shock, I made it to the Reception. Was given a \"Welcome Drink\" from the fridge and sat in breakfast room while my bags were taken to my room. (The hotel staff brought my luggage up and the down stairs on all my visits). I was also given a guidebook to Amsterdam 2007 and a leaflet about the Hotel. Had to lodge \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 Deposit for the Room Key /TV remote control - not asked for on subsequent visits. I did not read any reviews of the Hotel until after my first visit. Most reviewers comment on the friendly staff which I fully endorse. What sticks out in my mind was on Sunday morning when I asked where I would find a Catholic Church ,Osam (the Manager) was very helpful with directions and when I returned later in day the first thing he asked me had I found it. I stayed in a different room each time. One had twin beds. All the rooms I stayed in are all very small. Very Compact. Bathrooms also compact - Toilet -Wash hand basin and Shower. Wouldn't fancy it if I was any way overweight. I found the beds comfortable. Each room has a small fridge and safe. I did find that the safe was a little too high in my last room. One note of caution, mind the bed clothes that you don't trip. Also check if any small step from Bathroom to Bedroom. My most recent room had a balcony overlooking the street. There is a very nice Tearoom on the opposite side on the street called Jennifer's. There are a number ATM machines nearby, although one a few doors from Jennifer's did not take my type of card. I used the Shuttle Bus to return to the airport each time. The Hotel Reception did the booking for me. On my most recent arrival when I took the Train to Central Station, I had intending taking the Tram(which stops close to Hotel) but as it was a dry evening I ended up walking. Probably took about 15 minutes. On reflection maybe a bit too far to walk when pulling a suitcase. The Anne Frank House is only a few minutes away. Dam Square is about 10 minutes. One of my first stops there was Madame Tussauds. The Breakfast room is small. Even though I only have tea and toast at home when I go on holiday I like the Full Fry. So the continental breakfast is always a bit of a disappointment. Tea and Croissant still nice. It is not too difficult to find a restaurant around town that does the big fry. At breakfast, to make tea put teabag in cup and pour Boiling Water from Coffe Type Jug. If you need a bigger cup just ask. The Front door of hotel is always closed. Guests have to buzz everytime thecome in. You have to pass reception to get any of the rooms. Whenever I get back to to Amsterdam and as long as I (or if I should have a travelling companion) can make it up those steps anticipate I will be staying in the Nadia.

We headed down a poorly lit hallway with metal room doors on either side. Still not happy and wondering what we got ourselves into. We took a right and entered the breakfast room. Instant happiness! The room was everything you would want in an old European hotel. The room was small but very well decorated and cozy. There were large and beautiful windows and a door leading to a small balcony. I'm happy now. Anyway, the man told us our room was ready and gave us our key. We walked up two more flights of, again, VERY steep stairs. As we entered our room we were so very happy. It was the top corner room overlooking the canal and church. A door entered onto a small balcony and a set of half-moon windows opened to the canal and church. The room was extremely clean and efficient. High ceilings and everything you could possibly need to make your stay comfortable. The bed was very comfy. In the morning we returned to the breakfast room for the complimentary breakfast. The best croissants, jam, coffee, and juice. Again, very nice. The hotel is located near the Anne Frank house on a canal. I recommend this hotel ONLY if you want to brave the stairs. There is no elevator so you need to be able to climb the stairs. The staff at the hotel is far above average. So - excellent staff, great location, cool room, very clean.

Very good free city map supplied - better than any others I've seen. Our first night was on the street side with good balcony and pleasant sitting outside day & night. Fresh flowers in the room and daily room service. Very clean and tidy small rooms. We enjoyed the unsual design of the distinctly Dutch hotel. Steep stairs (amused us) and small rooms are very sensible to an inner city hotel at good prices. This is not your everyday hotel chain boring same-old-some-old experience. Distinctly Dutch - give it a go! Subsequent nights we moved by invitation of the manager to another corner room over-looking the canel. Wonderful with balcony again. We left the window open to hear the church clock bells and night sounds far below. Breakfast was nice again in a corner room which could be busy but wasn't for us. We had good croissants orange juice, tea & coffee with some cake: eat as much as you like. Dont be too fussy, this is not the Ritz, but it is good clean accomodation with excellent staff and very central to everything. Walking all over is easy, safe and trams are good when tired. Be friendly and get friendly back. If you do as we did and complement the Dutch on their multi-lingual skills you'll have only smiles and pleasant times.

This is because of the intimate nature of the physical structure, the history, and location of the building, and the intimate nature of the hotel owners and staff. Now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important to understand; this hotel is not for everybody because, and I like to think in a symbolic way, the two flights of very narrow and very steep staircases that one must climb up to hotel itself. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed there you know exactly what I mean\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this is an old building with no elevator so in order enter you must climb a big staircase. No joke. It like climbing a small mountain. But if you are up for the task and ready to climb the stairs to see what awaits you at the top then push the buzzer on the street go though the door and up you go! Warm and friendly faces greet you at the top in the very small cozy lobby. A smiling attendant offers to bring your luggage up the steep staircase. You are welcomed with a cold drink. Osam and his staff are ready for your arrival and they addressed me by name before I told them who I was. Osasm sized me up and gave me the loveliest room, #207 by the way, a corner room overlooking the canal and street. He gives rooms based on personal need and his expert knowledge of what room would be best for you. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a luxurious room. Mine was small yet warm, with few amenities. (ok Osam, here is a negative, just like you wanted to know): the bathroom amenities could be greatly improved like better towels, soap, show curtain etc. It was clean but not fancy. Small but cozy. Trade in fancy for an historic building with years of history and personal service. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old building and an historic monument so I take these things in stride\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this is not a fancy place, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a genuine place and so some things can slip by. The personal service continued through my stay. Each time I returned to the hotel and by the time I reached the top of the stairs my key was placed for me on the counter. You leave the key each time you go out. The staff experience here is unlike any other. When was the last time you were greeted and attended to by the owner himself who is running the hotel from the big the long counter in the lobby. A place you must spend time in is the kitchen/ breakfast room. There you will find a tasty breakfast in the AM and coffee served all day and late into the night. One morning I ate some croissants and sipped coffee on the small kitchen balcony overlooking the street below. It was bucolic; a memory and feeling I will always cherish. My pleasant interactions with Osam the inn keeper continued my entire stay and during my last night I stayed with him talking for 2 hours and having the nicest exchange. When my cab came at 5:15 am Osam himself carried one of my bags down those steep flights and arranged a cheaper cab to get me to the train. I could go on about the guys who carry your bags up those long stairs and the kitchen staff, the magnificent view of the church across the street across from the Ann Frank House, the location, the location\u00e2\u20ac\u00a65 minutes walk to Dam Square, near all trams, near the quite Jordan and the \u00e2\u20ac\u01539 streets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shopping area, an internet caf\u00c3\u00a9s down the street, good restaurants on the street, and a really tasty french fry cart right across the street\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and on and on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. but what makes this place great is what YOU can get from it. I will certainly return to the Nadia again when I visit Amsterdam. Osam has already promised me that if I want the same room, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mine although there are so many lovely rooms I might try something new.

From the exterior, it is unprepossessing - the narrow front door entrance is shoe-horned between a sewing machine shop (they still exist!) and a lighting establishment, with a protruding sign reminiscent of the Seventies. You press a buzzer to be let in and you are faced with a veritable Matterhorn of narrow, steep steps up to Reception. But, hey, this is Amsterdam, and that's how they made their houses. So either you will hate it already and wish you had booked a modern, purpose built, characterless concrete rectangle somewhere, or you will love it for its characterful, traditional appeal. I loved it. The Nadia occupies several floors of a sweeping crescent terrace, built circa 1890 and once elegant, but in need of the refurbishment currently underway. In its early days, part of it was used by the royal palace on Dam square, a few minutes walk away, to house its servants. At other times, it provided apartments for well-to-do middle class Amsterdamers, and had an array of useful shops at street level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of which (no, not the computer outlet) still exists. Once you have scaled the entrance steps, you will more than likely be greeted by the owner himself manning the Reception desk who will offer a welcoming drink from the chill cabinet, proffer maps and guides and useful info, and, if your room isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready, suggest you wait in the bright, airy and welcoming breakfast room along the corridor, overlooking the street below on one side and canal on the other and bedecked with plants and flowers. Judging by the brochure, the rooms are varied and quirky. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d booked a twin for single occupancy, which had a (smallish) double bed and (child-sized) single bed. It was at the rear, looking out onto other apartments but suited me fine, especially as it was blissfully quiet, apart from the non-intrusive quarter-hour gentle bonging of a nearby church clock. With full occupancy of a (slim) couple and (well behaved) child it would have been a squeeze, with definitely no leeway for swinging a cat, especially in the toilet/shower-room which was definitely one person standing room only, but for a three-day stay (which, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d guess is the average for most people visiting Amsterdam), it would be bearable for a two-and-a-half person family, and, erm, cosy for a couple. Think twice about demanding a room with a view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there could be traffic noise from the street below. Breakfasts at the Nadia are what you would expect from a typical Dutch hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c croissants, a variety of breads and confitures, cold meats and cheese, coffee and a choice of teas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all help yourself, but with the lady of the establishment on hand in the adjacent kitchen. Anybody wanting eggs and bacon and hashbrowns and suchlike should opt for a concrete rectangle place\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Apart from its welcoming atmosphere, cleanliness and quiet, the joy of the Nadia is its perfectly located central position \u00e2\u20ac\u201c twixt Central Station and Rembrandt Square, and the Red Light District (should you wish its dubious delights) and the architectural jewels of the Westerkerk Jordaan quarter. Everywhere else is either walkable or easily accessed by tram, bus, or canal bus, or, if you must, wobbly (depending on your ability) bicycle. My reservations? Definitely not suitable for the infirm or anyone with mobility problems (as are many other Amsterdam hotels with walk-up, steep stairs), and, judged entirely on my own room, not suitable for the claustrophobic or any couple not on the best of terms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 And the lack of air conditioning could be a distinct drawback on hot nights (although my room had a fan strategically placed pointing at the bed. I wondered if the Red Light establishments had such luxury \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find out). Otherwise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 out of 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially at the price\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 (PS: Bath mat, please, before my return visit!) (PPS: Beware Amsterdam taxi drivers.

The building was \"very\" much typical of traditional Amsterdam. The welcome you receive was warm and friendly with all luggage taken upstairs for you - so no carrying things up the steep stairs. As we arrived early we enjoyed a complimentary continental breakfast before heading out to explore. By the time we got to our room later in the day our luggage was waiting for us - talk about service. The views from our room were fab and we even had a balcony looking out to the canal. Rooms were comfortable though not overly big but were kept immaculate with ALL linen including duvet cover changed daily. The staff were all so friendly that you were made to feel at home - something you can never achieve fully in a larger commercial hotel.

The hotel is conveniently situated close to all attractions. The rooms are a bit tiny but the big windows openeing to the canal may remedy that (we got a canal-side room).

Our decision to book at the Nadia had much to do with the competitive rates, but mostly the glowing reviews. The Nadia Hotel lived up to every wonderful thing we have read. The staff is warm, friendly and accomodating. The owner, Osam is special in his own right. He makes you feel as though you are the only guest and your happiness and comfort is his priority. He adds personal touches similar to what you would experience in a bed and breakfast. My favorite memory of Osam is being invited to the kitchen as he made me a pot of coffee 2 hours before breakfast even began. We had many fantastic conversations with Osam that again, are as memorable as Amsterdam itself. The past reviews have mentioned the stairs, yes there is a bit of a climb which before arrival, we worried about, however, the anticipation far exceeded the reality. We saw guests young, old and even disabled climb the stairs to reception - use your judgement based on your own physical capabilities. There was a specific review mentioning room 316, that it was small, dirty, with an odor. I had the PLEASURE of staying in room 316. It was cozy, bright, clean and perfect as far as Im concerned. Im confused to even read such a review. Why would anyone care if the rooms are small in a city like Amsterdam? The only quality time spent in the hotel, was not the room, it was dining in the lovely breakfast room or at reception having wonderful chats with the staff and Osam. I look forward to returning to my new second home at the Nadia Hotel. If you decide to book a reservation, I can say with certainty that you made a wise decision.

My wife and I stayed at Nadia twice during our two-week trip to Holland over the holidays. Both of our stays were absolutely incredible. Like many other reviews on this site, I must start by saying that one of the real benefits of this hotel is the manager and staff, who are always pleasant, upbeat, and very helpful. We were fortunate to be able to stay in several different rooms during our stay. The two rooms on the 4th floor that have balconies facing Westerkerk and the Canal are really nice. The view of from there is beautiful and we were lucky enough to have room 412 (with a large balcony) for the unbelievable New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve fireworks display. I highly recommend Amsterdam for new years\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very fun! It is true that the breakfast is very basic, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free! So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to complain too much about that. The stairs are very steep; however, in my opinion, that makes Nadia even more charming and the staff went out of their way to help carry bags up and down the stairs for the guests. The location of the hotel is fantastic. It is easy to walk to many major attractions and for those that are farther away, there is a tram stop and taxi stand across the street at Wester market. In this regard, Osam and the staff are also very helpful in providing assistance in getting around town and finding what you are looking to see. I am very happy to have found such a great place to stay. You will be made to feel at home during your stay at Hotel Nadia! Enjoy you stay in AMS!

It is beautifully composed and will give you a good insight into your stay at the Nadia. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel extremely welcome and yes, the room was small, but adequate for two of us. In fact, it was cosy, intimate and in character with the rest of the building, which is historic and should never be modernised. I do have problems with my knees and was apprehensive about the stairs, but there is a hand rail on each wall and I managed them better than I had hoped. Just be careful as the steps are narrow. There is a small landing halfway up the staircase, which is good for an oxygen intake! The breakfast room is one of the prettiest I have ever seen. Sadly, the breakfast itself comprised only of bread, cake, croissants and various jams. I feel some cold meat and eggs would have been a nice addition. The room itself was decorated in dark wood paneling, with lots of shelves and a small, but very functional bathroom. It was very warm however, so we kept the window open at all times. Please be aware that trams run constantly and love to ring their bells and the church opposite chimes every 15 minutes. The beds were very, very narrow and extremely uncomfortable. We spent each night clinging onto the mattress for fear of falling onto the floor. Regarding cleanliness, the hotel was spotless and we were asked each day if we would like housekeeping to tidy our room. Despite the poor beds and lack of a decent breakfast, this is a lovely hotel, with friendly staff, in a fantastic location. Amsterdam is a beautiful, friendly, relaxed and fun place to be and I would challenge anyone to visit the city and not have a good time. For something a little different, visit De Efteling which is an amazing fairytale themed park. It is an hour train ride from Central Station, then approximately 50 minutes by bus. We went to visit the Winter Wonderland that they do for Christmas, and it was absolutely perfect. Fake snow, real bonfires, warme chocolade melk and hot waffles.

I also must add the only time you will go to the room is to sleep and how much room is necessary for that. There is a safe in the room and a hairdryer. It was a bit dark and I asked for a lamp and it was delivered. They advertised wireless internet but at first it wasn't working. I must say that the owner/manager along with some outside help worked around the clock to make it work perfectly. So if wireless is what you need they have it and it was fast. The room was clean and we had a beautiful view of the canal with windows that opened, that made it even better as the church bells were very pleasant to listen to. The room was cleaned every day and the entire staff was very friendly. The beds were comfortable and the pillows just the way I like them. I felt very much at ease and comfortable here. The same 7 days at a few other places were 800+ euros and we went and looked at them. We found that we were winners at 650 euro.

First, I'll say that I'm a seasoned business traveler, and have been to Amsterdam 11 times, so this is not my first \"small hotel\" expereince in the city. I arrived around 10am. No one offered to help me up the very steep stairs to the lobby which is one floor above street level. The staff was always very nice and helpful. I was offered coffee or tea if I wanted, and they checked my bags, advising the room would not be available until 1pm. More very steep stairs up to my room. Facing the steepness of the stairs was a real drag after a long day of walking around the city. If you don't have alot of stamina, skip this place. Yes, these stairs are steeper than any I've encountered in Amsterdam. My room was cramped, even by Amsterdam standards. The bedspread was torn and had burn holes, the sheets were clean, but had a rip in it. I did not receive fresh towels for several days - the staff would simply fold up the used towels and place them back on the rack. This was annoying as I was only given one hand towel and one bath towel, as a single guest. I found myself hitting my head on shelves, and banging my shin on the bed platform more often than I care to admit, as the room was so tight. As mentioned in other reviews, the toilet is in the shower. My toilet seat cover could not be lowered, nor could the seat be lifted, due to it being wedged between the toilet tank (hard to describe). This led to constant risk of items falling into the open toilet from the miniscule glass shelf above, the only place in the bathroom for your personal toiletries. The room was on the back of the hotel facing a courtyard, and was mostly quiet, with the exception of hearing the church bells of the Westerkerk through the night (this was very pleaseant, actually). Some of the nights were warm, so I had the window open. Apparently the reception desk also faced the courtyard some floors below, as on a couple of nights I was kept awake by the constant piercing ring of the reception desk telephone, echoing up the courtyard at all hours. Why the management doesn't either lower the volume, change the type of ringer (a flashing light perhaps?), or simply keep the window shut so as to not disturb the guests, is beyond me. I'd say the Nadia is an okay place to stay if you're not bothered by what I've mentioned. The location is very good for getting around the city (close to 3 tram lines, Canal Bus and Dam Square), there's an ATM across the street, and an internet cafe a block away. I feel the price was high for the room.

We were there before our rooms were ready so the owner sat us in the breakfast room with a pile of brochures and booklets and kept our mugs of free coffee full until our rooms were ready. The rooms are tiny but so well laid out that they have everything you need and more. The rooms even have fridges which I know from staying in Amsterdam several times before is very rare, expecially for a 3*. The location is good, right by the Anne Frank museum on Prinsengracht and only a few minutes walk from Dam Square. Also, our favourite coffeeshop (La Tertulia) is just around the corner so this is another bonus! Breakfast is simple continental style - croissants, pastries, fruit, ham, cheese, toast, jam etc. with lots of fruit juice and cosntant refills of freshly made coffee from (I think) the owner's wife, who is really friendly and funny. I've read other reviews on here complaining about the room size and I imagine if you want to sit around all day in a big spacious 5* hotel for your visit, then you will be disappointed with the Nadia. If, like us, however you just want a base to sleep and eat breakfast with great, warm, friendly service, I highly recommend the Nadia.

When you open the front door to the hotel you will be astounded by the stairs that lead up to the reception, the 2 flights of stairs that go straight up! So this is defiantly not a hotel for anyone who has trouble climbing stairs, as they are a bit steep. Once we made it up the stair, we were given a warm welcome and a nice cold welcome drink and assigned our room. Which was on the 4th floor, so up we went 2 more flights of steep stairs. The room we had was the standard room which over looked nothing in particular as it was at the back of the building. At first I thought I wanted to try to get a canal room, but realized that the traffic noise probably would have bothered me. Now the room is very small and basic but it is clean and comfortable. Our bathroom was the same. It is basically a large shower room, so no romantic baths. My only complaint was that the hotel lacks air conditioning, which would have been nice one the really warm nights. My second complaint, which has nothing to do with the hotel, was about the church nearby that rang it's bells all through the night, so it made sleeping with the window open a bit of a pain.
