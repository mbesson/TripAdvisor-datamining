There is a couple of really good reviews and some really bad ones. As an easy going and optimistic type of person I decided to ignore the bad reviews, book my girlfriend and I in get on with our holiday planning. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and hostels around the world from $2 huts in Thailand and very budget hostels in Bolivia to the Ritz in Jamaica and Bellagio in Las Vegas and I have to say this is the WORST accomodation I have EVER stayed in. Trust me basic hotels do not bother me. First of all the room is horribly presented, ok I'm not overly bothered about that. Next the walls are paper thin, I could hear the room next door talking like they were in the same room and doors were slamming throughout the night. Next they turn the heating completely off so it wall really cold so we had do use the old air con unit to keep the temperature in the room. There were big black hairs in inside the bed which were probably from the previous people and the sheets were like they had never been washed, were old, very dusty and probably had all sorts living inside them. The dust being wafted around the room by the air con made me feel really sick and disgusted. Went to bed at midnight, was still awake at 3am when I just wanted to go and find somewhere else. I was still awake and 5am when the call to prayer started over loud speaker at the Blue Mosque (yes great location!!!) and by 7am I finally fell asleep after deciding to sleep in my clothes. At 10am I got up, refused to risk breakfast and checked out, refusing to stay the following night which my girlfriend I were book in for. and went to a different 3 star hotel called Asur which was basic but quiet and clean and a palace in comparison. Cem sultan would have ruined my first days sightseeing had I not been so tanked up on Turkish coffee (which is excellent!) I honestly would have rather lost all the money I had paid to stay any longer at the Cem Sultan then stay another minute!! After we were out of there our holiday was amazing, the people were really friendly.

However, it would only get worse as the lights in the hallway to our room flickered on and off as I passed rooms with their doors lying open and half naked teenageers lying on their beds with their televisions blaring loudly. The room was shocking as the ceiling lamp hung with wires exposed and also flickered on and off and for most of the stay did not work at all which was a problem as it was the only light in the room. The furniture was filthy and not acceptable to place your clothes in due to the dirt and the amount of space it offered and so we lived out of suitcases. I had to pile up some of the furniture to make enough space to put two suitcases in the room. The beds were hard and uncomfortable and the bathroom had no shower cubicle and so the water flooded the bathroom floor. The tiles near the toilet were not secured properly and looked like they were ready to drop onto some poor victim's head in the near future. The window in the room faced a brick wall and we could hear a baby crying a lot with a Turkish family chatting/arguing a lot at night and during the day. The first night we stayed, someone knocked on our room door several times and tried to open our door at one o'clock in the morning by turning the door handle - not pleasant! The breakfast room was dusty and old and very out of date decor and the view minimal and mostly of horrible crumbling roof tops. The breakfast consisted of stale bread and the jams etc looked like they had been there for some time!

It's loud! We got a deluxe room with a Bosphorus Room. All rooms with Bosphorus views, as it turns out, are right next to the stairs. We could hear everyone coming in and out of their bedrooms and then down the stairs. What other reviewers have said about the staff sitting around watching their t.v. (loudly) is very true. From our room we could here conversations as well as the televison (which is on all day and all night). Their friends are over all of the time and it's more like their living room rather than a place for the hotel guests to sit and relax. Bottom line on this point is that I had to buy earplugs to block out the majority of the sound so that I could actually get some sleep. 2. It's not very clean. While pleasant in smell, I noticed that our sheets weren't changed until I asked and forced the issue. Not once in our week stay was the floor cleaned or the little rug vacuumed. The bathroom shower or sink weren't cleaned, and the garbage wasn't thrown out unless I requested. This probably won't bother you unless you stay more than two days. 3. Television only got Turkish and one French channel. 4. Breakfast was decent but not started on time and usually ran out of items early on.

We wanted to book one of the hotel's normal rooms, but the budget room was all the hotel had available. The website listed this as a \"smaller room\" with a \"window looking to small space.\" Since the price was quite low, and many of the other hotels in the area were already fully booked, we decided to take a chance. We didn't mind a small room (we've stayed in smaller), and we didn't particularly care about having a view. The location of the hotel is fantastic, just down the street from the Four Seasons and only a block or two from the open gardens between the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. The location made it very convenient to visit all of the sights of Sultanhamet, and it was a short walk past the Blue Mosque to the Sultanhamet tram stop. Our flight to Istanbul arrived quite late, but we had no problems checking in at such a late hour, and the room was small but not uncomfortable. Breakfast was served on the top floor of the building, and the stairs might be difficult to manage for those with low mobility. The breakfast itself was only average, and the buffet contained cold meats, cheeses, raisins and dried apricots, corn flakes, white bread, and yogurt. The view of the sea from the breakfast room was nice, and we appreciated the fact that the room was enclosed, since we were visiting in a colder month when we wouldn't get much sun on an outdoor terrace. However, even with our low expectations for the room, it still managed to disappoint us. We certainly didn't have a view, since \"small space\" turned out to be little more than a ventilation shaft, and the room received absolutely no natural light. This was a bit inconvenient, since we need to turn on the lights even during the day, and in the mornings we woke in the dark. However, the most annoying thing was the bathroom. When we first arrived, we had to fiddle with the knobs on the plumbing to start water running to the toilet, and the shower was a constant source of grief. There was no curtain or stall, so luckily we didn't leave anything in the bathroom while we showered, because the floor drain was extremely slow. After only a few minutes with the shower running, the entire bathroom floor was flooded with 2 inches of standing water! Anyone needing to use the sink or toilet afterward had to wade through the room. And once the water did finally drain, some kind of problems with the plumbing meant that a bad odor would sometimes come from the drain. Glancing into the other rooms as they were cleaned each day, the standard rooms seemed quite large and attractive with plenty of light and attractive archways. One would hope that with more frequent use, they might have better-maintained plumbing and not suffer from the same issues as our room. Our \"promotional\" room was very inexpensive, so for the same price I think we might have been better off booking a private room in a hostel or lower-end pension that might have been brighter and better maintained. And while I do hope that the standard rooms are in better condition, there are some very nice choices in the same area for only a few euros more.", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Nova Scotia", "Title": "\u201clazy & charmless staff, grim tiny room\u201d", "Author": "novaterracotta", "ReviewID": "UR29370762", "Content": "After reading the positive reviews about this hotel I thought it would be good value but quickly realized that it wasn't worth the 50Euros .

We had a room at the back of the building overlooking other buildings and was quite dark. The room was quite basic, very dated and run down. I think some of the rooms have been renovated quite nicely tho and the ones with a sea view at the front looked much bigger and far nicer. The lamp by the bed's plug looked precarious, the wall around the socket had crumbled away and there was a couple of exposed wires coming out of the plug which didn't look particularly safe. The room was quite loud - we could easily hear everything from every side of the room. The bed sank heavily towards the middle and wasn't very comfortable. The room was a bit too warm for me with a heater on which we couldn't turn off. There was an air conditioner but it didn't seem to be working. The bathroom was freezing, very small and very old.

The shower nozzle was one of those annoying old ones with water going in every direction but it was hot (even if it was difficult to get the right temperature) which was better than our friend in the next room who could only get luke warm water.

On the opposite side of the street there are some peculiar remnants of Roman era and as a result the hotel obtains an unexpected feature - a broad view to the Bosporus joining the Sea of Marmara, Princess Islands and the Asian part of the city. From my window I could see scores of busy small fishing boats in the morning, passing the straits large cruise ships, tankers, ferry boats, military ships; once early in the morning I even spotted a submarine going to the Black Sea direction. It is an awesome experience, to wake up in the morning with the Bosporus before your eyes, or to see the full moon rising over it in the evening. My room had a \"deluxe\" prefix, which means two things - the sea view and some additional space. This additional space makes it a regular hotel room we are familiar with and makes space for another window - as a result the room looks bright and even spacious, though I would use this world carefully. Apparently, not all the rooms in the hotel has the sea view, probably four of them. The others, most likely, face the nearby buildings. Finally, everyone has a chance to admire the view from the cafe on the top of the building. The breakfast was surprisingly good, featuring very good turkish tea (\u00c3\u00a7ay), cherry and strawberry jams as an addition to a regular set of cornflakes, milk, coffee, fresh bread, cheese, sausages, eggs, olives and vegetables. Do not forget to add the boiling water to your cup of tea, otherwise it might be way too strong. The staff in the hotel was very helpful, non-intrusive and accurate, and I mean every world I said.

Before arr\u00c4\u00b1v\u00c4\u00b1ng from PAKISTAN w\u00c4\u00b1th my wife and children I was a little concerned as th\u00c4\u00b1s was my first visit to Turkey. We had booked at the CEM SULTAN HOTEL \u00c4\u00b1n the Sultan Ahmet area of the c\u00c4\u00b1ty. Since I was travell\u00c4\u00b1ng with children there were many quest\u00c4\u00b1ons on my mind - What would the hotel be like? Would \u00c4\u00b1t be as good as \u00c4\u00b1t looked on \u00c4\u00b1ts website? Would there be any nasty surpr\u00c4\u00b1ses \u00c4\u00b1n srore for us? Would we be charged h\u00c4\u00b1dden extras? I need not have worried! Murat (the manager) and the rest of the staff at the CEM SULTAN hotel gave the perfect hol\u00c4\u00b1day of a l\u00c4\u00b1fet\u00c4\u00b1me! I can recommend th\u00c4\u00b1s hotel to anyone! The manager (Murat) kept us \u00c4\u00b1nformed and entertained all through our stay. Although we stayed for 9 days which is a long t\u00c4\u00b1me Murat helped us plan our days and where to go wh\u00c4\u00b1ch was very helpful. They also booked tax\u00c4\u00b1s and a lovely tour to the Pr\u00c4\u00b1nces Islands wh\u00c4\u00b1ch was a fantast\u00c4\u00b1c day out of the ma\u00c4\u00b1n c\u00c4\u00b1ty of Istanbul. The hotel was of an excellent standard and prov\u00c4\u00b1ded good value for money.The rooms were comfortable and clean. The rooms were cleaned and the l\u00c4\u00b1nen changed every day wh\u00c4\u00b1ch was so n\u00c4\u00b1ce to see. Me and my fam\u00c4\u00b1ly have enjoyed a wonderful stay at the CEM SULTAN hotel \u00c4\u00b1n the lovely city of Istanbul. We love Istanbul and \u00c4\u00b1ts helpful, fr\u00c4\u00b1endly and k\u00c4\u00b1nd people. Thank you to all at the Cem Sultan hotel for everyth\u00c4\u00b1ng.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full of character/it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quirky and it has that old world feeling to it. My room was charming and cosy at the same time and also came with a wonderful view. The bathrooms are modern in the ways that counted, clean and are stocked with nice toiletries.The hotel is within minutes of all the top tourist sites which meant I could go back to the hotel easily in the middle of the day for a rest/get an umbrella/get an extra sweater/or drop off my many purchases! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also within a few minutes of a tram stop (which gives you easy access to the Grand Bazaar/Spice Bazaar/Taksim). The hotel couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been better positioned. Also, the area felt really safe even when I walked back to the hotel at night by myself. They serve up a really nice/varied breakfast which means you can actually eat a healthy breakfast (fresh fruit/cereal. Their oranges were really sweet and especially nice.) But they have something for everyone, including freshly baked goods, boiled eggs//tomatoes/feta cheese/cucumbers.For those of you who are addicted to the internet like me, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a computer terminal for guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 use there but they do have free wi-fi in the bar/breakfast area. Lastly, I found the staff to be very helpful/efficient. I always figure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good sign when you e-mail a hotel and they respond to you within hours as opposed to days, which was always my experience with the Cem Sultan Hotel.
