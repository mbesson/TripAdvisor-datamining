That is definitely true if each star represents a request for additional pillows, because it took three requests over a two day period to actually get an additional pillow (with the staff saying each time that it would promptly be taken care of). Will you need an additional pillow? Only if you like resting your neck on something that isn't as nearly as flat as the mattress itself. Getting that out of the way, the rooms are solid quality and a pretty nice size, and the location of the hotel isn't bad. It is probably a 15-20 minute walk to the start of the crazy part of La Rambla and there are two metro stops near the hotel (both on the same line unfortunately). The actual neighborhood where the hotel was pretty calm, which I liked, and there are some restaurants and bars nearby, but a lot of the best restaurants and bars in the same neighborhood were a 10-15 minute walk away. The hotel staff, though initially unfriendly, redeemed themselves and ended up being helpful, though don't expect to be greeted warmly like you might at some other hotels in Europe. A map (the least helpful map I've gotten from a hotel in Europe) was only provided after it was requested, and no attempt was made at the time to show the location of the hotel on the map. We had the unfortunate luck to be staying in the hotel at the same time as a large group (25 or 30) of loud, obnoxious men who decided to have parties in their room from basically midnight to 3 a.m. That isn't the hotel's fault. However, what I do fault the hotel for is (1) the thinness of the walls; and (2) the fact that this went on for three nights of our (and presumably other guests' ) complaints Wireless, though free, does not work in the rooms. There is free ethernet in the rooms, but what they don't tell you is that it is barely faster than dial up. We discovered dirty sheets partway through our stay, so either they weren't changing the sheets (more likely) or they were putting dirty looking sheets on the beds.

It may not be in the centre of Barcelona but it is a 10-15 minute walk away from the centre. There is also 2 metro stops about 2 minutes walk from the hotel, thus making the hotel very accessible to see all of Barcelona. Would strongly recommend the metro to anyone. Trains run regularly and get you anywhere in the city much quicker than the sight seeing buses do. If using the metro there are automated ticket machines at all the stations. Would recommend that you buy a ticket for 10 journeys as it is better value for money than single trip tickets. You will be surprised how much you will hop on and off the metro. Check in was as straightforward as ever. All staff are very helpful and polite. Rooms are quite spacious for some European city hotels and are maintained to a high standard and cleaned on a daily basis. The rooms are lacking tea and coffee making facilities but with cafes and eateries near by you do not really miss this. The hotel also does not have a restaurant but there are that many eateries in Barcelona that this is not a problem. If eating out I would recommend that you eat away from las ramblas as this is much cheaper. There are many good places but my personal recommendation would be to eat at the maremagnum. There is an exceptional italian restaurant called Gino's. I have never been able to fault the quality of their food or the service. There is also a good all you can eat buffet at the maremagnum also. For those looking to relax, I would recommend a trip to the beach at barceloneta. If you want to go to some of the main attractions such as Gaudi's house I recommend you get there early as queues can be long. Another tip would be if you want to go to see the fountains in the evening I recommend you are there for about 9pm as this seems to be when the main show starts.

The breakfast is served from 7-11am, which is good, but it was no better than basic. The croissants weren't fresh and the toaster took forever. It did amuse us watching people wait for toast though! One guest asked for soft boiled eggs, which should have been available according to the menu- but the grumpy waitress clearly couldn't be bothered and just said no! The location is good- about 5 mins from the metro- just two stops and a few mins to Las Ramblas. Or you can walk it in about 20mins.

Chose to stay here since feedback from friends and family was that the city centre tourist areas (Las Ramblas etc) would be loud well into the wee small hours. Getting to and from hotel was simple \u2013 we took airport bus (Aerobus) to Plaza Espana \u2013 hotel is a 10 minute walk away. Modern hotel, friendly staff, clean spacious rooms \u2013 pictures on the internet are exactly what we got (not always the case!). Beds are comfortable, air-con is efficient, rooms are double glazed so you\u2019ll get a good night's sleep! Booked through Lastminute.com Special Offer and paid \u00a3294.00 for 4 nights. Emailed request for high floor to the hotel, which they allocated us. Didn\u2019t have breakfast at the hotel \u2013 it wasn\u2019t included in our rate and at 14 Euros per person, it seemed a bit expensive for what was on offer; we did, however, get a free glass of Cava (although the bar area where you claim it from is dead!) There\u2019s plenty of small caf\u00e9s and great cake shops in the vicinity which offer much better value for money. Hotel is about a 10 \u2013 15 minute walk to the University then a further 5 minutes or so to the Plaza Catalunya and the start of the Ramblas. It\u2019s a nice walk along tree lined boulevards with lots of interesting buildings en route. There\u2019s also the Rocafort Metro Station just round the corner for the hotel \u2013 the metro system is really simple to use (just make sure you go through the right side of the ticket barrier!) The only 'negative observation' (and not a problem) was the lack of restaurants in the local area - plenty of small bars with tapas etc, but nothing really serving anything more substantial. There's a Mediterranean Restaurant across the road which serves traditional meals - ideal of pig's trotters are your cup of tea...

Free high speed internet in the room, which is GREAT. Have to give kudos for every hotel that provide this service free of charge as it is becoming one of the necessities in our daily life, and so many hotels out there still charge you a rip-off amount for it. Here you just have to borrow their Ethernet cable and you're all set to go. Location is very nice, Barcelona is not that big and you can walk to La Ramblas in about 20 min. Of course you can take the subway too which is near the hotel. Nice shops and restaurants in the nearby area although it is not the commercial touristy zone. Think I prefer this to being right in the centre as this feels more neighbourhoody but still convenient. Overall, a good choice that is reasonably priced. No complaints here.

Ten minutes after we arrived at Barcelona Estacion del Norte bus station, my mother's handbag with ALL her documents got stolen (side note: beware of the rampant theft problems in Barcelona and keep your stuff in a money belt or other secure location..). After a long couple of hours spent at the police station and then scouring the station trying to locate the purse possibly discarded after the cash was taken out, the HCC Open was a nice place to come and take a breather. The staff at the front desk (who spoke great English) were pretty helpful with the whole situation. We got a triple room with 2 double beds for a great price. The room was clean and when we had problems with our TV, the staff immediately sent someone up to fix it. The restaurant food is reasonably priced and decent, and there is internet connectivity (though it will cost you 3.50 for 15 minutes). In terms of location, the HCC is a little bit away from Las Ramblas and on a Sunday/late nights there isn't much open near the hotel by way of restaurants or shops. However, the Rocafort metro stop is a stone's throw away from the hotel and you can basically get anywhere more interesting within 5-10 minutes. I've stayed in Las Ramblas during a previous visit to Barcelona and found it to get a bit noisy/rowdy during the weekends and thus decided to try something a little out of the city for my parents to get a good nights' sleep.
