Our every expectation was exceeded. We were the 153rd and 154th guests since the opening. Everything that we could have hoped for was available. The service was the best we have ever had anywhere....even better than at home. There was nothing we could ask for that they couldn't bring or do for us. Breakfast, lunch and dinner from a menu with a good variety of choices. The fresh fruit was served up perfectly sliced and looking like a piece of art. Even our order from the snack bar was delivered right to our sunbed on china plates and real cutlery. The bar had PREMIUM drinks and concoctions including Crown Royal and Grey Goose. Our room was more like a palace with 3 sets of wide patio doors across the back viewing out to the mangroves which our own private patio overlooked and contained table, chairs, loungers and our own private tub. We had a very comfortable king size bed, comfy couch and chairs, desk, walk-in closet/dressing room, good-size flat screen with IPOD connection for music, etc. We came home wanting to revamp our house to replicate the bathroom from Blue Diamond....his/her showers, makeup desk, beautiful tile, very modern and clean. The bathrobes and slippers were just icing on the already perfect cake. A roof top cigar bar was a great spot for the evening hours. Plenty of room to get fresh air if you don't smoke. Even did some dancing. Very accomodating staff. Again the service was 6 star. The staff were superb. The transportation driver came right to our door to inform us that he was ready to take us to the beach, or pool, or restaurant or lobby. We never waited more than 3 minutes. We absolutely loved this resort.

One of the biggest complaints my partner and I have had in our Caribbean travel is that the rooms are \"clean but sterile\" - there is no dirt...but you feel like you are in a motel 6. Not here. The bed is very very comfortable. The lighting is nice. The room (one of the smallest at the resort) was HUGE. With its own living room, giant two shower bathroom, outdoor bathtub, and patio/backyard with recliners and a view of the cenote. it was like staying in the guest house of a rich relative, not a \"functional\" hotel room. The spa is magnificent and even if you don't want to pay for treatments the time in the therapeutic pool, the Hamam (steam room) and relaxation room drinking chlorophyll water was perfect. The pool is great with a great view of the ocean, and nice chairs. perfect. But, the top notch is the people who work here. They are from all over Mexico, are extremely friendly, and make you feel like an honored guest. My partner and I have been to Mexico, St. Maarten, Miami, Aruba, and nothing, nothing even came close to the luxury, relaxation, comfort, friendliness, and service of the Blue Diamond.

The beach can be a walk if you stay where we stayed, room 367, but there is transportation available at your request, all the drivers were great, only name I remember is Omar, but the rest were awesome to. All the wait staff was excellent, Manuel was probably our favorite, but the rest were awesome, just don't remember all the names. We've been to the Riviera Maya about 7 times in the last 4 years, and we usually say we would go back to each resort, but probably will not, this resort I can say I will be back, I am curious to see what its like when its running at full capacity. Also, would like say that every issue we had was handled immediately, whether it was a clogged toilet or no hot water, staff was immediately working on it, most resorts you have to call about 10 times. The only issues we had was no hot water for one day and no water at all the morning we left, but they were working on it and also when we arrived there was no one there to greet us or carry our luggage, not a big deal, probably just an oversight as other guests said they were greeted. Also, the beach needed a little tlc, but in their defense the water was really rough and churning up a lot of stuff, red flags were out every day we were there. I would definitely recommend this resort if you are wanting a nice quiet, relaxing vacation, if you are looking for a resort to do cannon balls in the pool, drink from your bubba keg at the pool, have blaring music at the pool, and sit at the swim up bar all day, then this is not the resort for you.

It's been on my mind and based on the amazing service and help that we received by the staff at the Mandarin Oriental, I can't put this off any longer. So here goes... we planned our wedding at another very nice hotel (much larger than the MO) in the Riviera Maya and it went horribly wrong. We flew down ahead of time to scope out all our potential sites and decided that while we loved the MO, we'd save a little by going with our other option (\"Hotel to Remain Anonymous\") that had a little more to do for some of our guests and we would apply the savings to our honeymoon. It was a terrible decision. After months of dealing with \"Hotel to Remain Anonymous\" who were giving us nothing but bait and switch, lies, fraud and continually beating us up with additional miscellaneous fees unsubstantiated fees, we told \"Hotel to Remain Anonymous\" that we were cancelling our wedding and telling our friends we were cancelling their airfare and room reservations. \"Hotel to Remain Anonymous\", basically said \"yea right, try it. No one cancels their wedding with less than 3 weeks left.\" Well apparently, we were the first and I was never happier with our last minute decision. We called the Mandarin Oriental that very same day, explained the situation, and asked if they could help us out before we would have to tell our guests that the whole adventure had been cancelled. Enter our Angels in the Riviera Maya, the incredible and amazing, Mauricio and Roxana. They told us not to worry, and they assured us that they would take care of everything for us. They asked a few questions, followed up with us for additional information when necessary and went to work behind the scenes making sure that everything would be ready for us and our guests. They not only took care of everything, they addressed everything with the professionalism and thoroughness that would have made the most obsessive compulsive sufferer comfortable. They arranged for limo pick-ups for our guests, took care of all of the menus, the cake, the photographer, flowers, hair, makeup, massages, Mariachi band, dj, costs, billing, etc., etc., etc. What was agreed between us and the MO was delivered, with no disappointments. They were divine. We went from 6 months of struggling with the planning dream team at \"Hotel to Remain Anonymous\" where even my Mexican born fiance\u2019 couldn\u2019t get them to understand in Spanish what they were supposed to be doing, and what they had promised us and written in their own contract, to working with total professionals that put us at ease. In short, we went from total devastation to total elation by switching to the MO. With less than 3 weeks remaining on the calendar for our wedding date, everything fell miraculously into place, without any stress (at least on our part). ;) We told our guests we had changed venues, but there would be no impact to them and that we\u2019d see them down there at our wedding. When they got there, they were thoroughly pleased with the hotel, the grounds, the service, the beach and the staff (that somehow knew everyone of our names by heart). Our wedding was amazing, our guests were astounded, the food was spectacular and there was absolutely nothing that disappointed us. Prior to the wedding, the MO helped arrange for us a private tour guide and bus to go to Chichen Itza and again, it was worry free and comfort and enjoyment filled. The MO staff catered to our every whim, and they treated us fairly and honestly throughout the entire process. If I ever get married again (just kidding honey), I would do it again at the MO in Riviera Maya. They were beyond exceptional and I would highly recommend them to anyone that ever asked the question, and now you understand why I am writing this review almost two years later. After all they did for us, writing a review on TripAdvisor is the absolute least that I can do to show our appreciation for the wonderful staff that peformed a wedding miracle for us in the Mayan Riviera. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you MO, Mauricio and Roxana, we will always be indebted to you.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with exceptional service\u201d", "Author": "chloe4245", "ReviewID": "UR117299569", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for a week.

The Mandarin Oriental Riviera Maya does not disappoint!!! This is a beautiful luxury resort property that has everything you would expect from the Mandarin Oriental in terms of style and service. Only a 3-hour direct flight from Washington Dulles and 30 minutes from Cancun Airport\u2026I spent 7 days at here. This Mexican paradise was a safe and peaceful resort, with great beach/spa/restaurants, and had absolutely exceptional service. This resort exceeded my expectations in every way and provided me with a perfect luxury beach holiday. Here\u2019s a quick summary: Accommodation: I spent a significant amount in what I would describe was my own personal slice of heaven. I stayed in one of the Beachfront Casitas that had a private terrace overlooking the beach, a roof deck with plunge pool, and its own bit of beachfront. Interior design was stylish with a modern decor. My room was spacious and had a beautiful bathroom overlooking a secluded garden. One of the things I loved about the resort was way the property was laid out and provided privacy for those who want it or common guest areas for those looking to be around people. Service: The most impressive part of the resort is the unparalleled service and renowned attention to detail. I didn\u2019t want for anything \u2013 the staff were always polite, helpful and extremely attentive. Since I was traveling alone, I would also like to mention that I found that the property to be incredibly safe. The hotel arranged for transportation to/from the airport and I never had to worry about anything. Dining: The food is of a very high standard. There are a variety of restaurants and bars that serve an eclectic selection of contemporary cuisine. Ambar is the much-touted signature restaurant, and Aguamarina is a lounge-like Mexican restaurant with a terrace and ocean views. One of my favorites was the beachfront/pool area restaurant - Ceviche Cha Cha. Whether you\u2019re by the pool or on the beach, you can have some of the best sushi/ ceviche. But if you\u2019re in the mood for something more substantial, the broiled fish sandwich or Kobe beef burger were fabulous along with chips, salsa & guacamole. Finally, if you\u2019re not inclined to leave your room - in-room dining was also an excellent choice. My terrace over looked the beach and was a lovely place to have a pre-dinner cocktail/snack or breakfast in the morning. For breakfast - I highly recommend the homemade yoghurt with fresh fruit. Spa: The Spa/gym is definitely worth a visit. The gym is very nicely equipped, airy, and inspires you to work out even on vacation. The spa itself is beautiful with separate massage rooms. I tried the deep tissue massage to which was a great way to spend time on one afternoon when it was a bit cloudy. But I also recommend trying the other amenities like the vitality pool and the large mosaic humidity/steam room called a \"hamam.\" Absolute heaven!!! Summary: The Mandarin was a true paradise and provided me with a perfect luxury beach holiday. The resort is ideal for singles, couples or families...and you could easily stay for a week without leaving its confines of the resort. Which is precisely what I did. I never needed to... or wanted to leave the resort.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointed by subpar wedding service!\u201d", "Author": "maisonpipi", "ReviewID": "UR100427835", "Content": "I feel responsible to share my experience with anyone else who is considering choosing the Mandarin Oriental Riviera Maya as a wedding venue. To be fair, if this review was based on the site visit alone, it would have been great. The ambiance is private and refreshing, incredible food, and friendly service of the staff. Along with Rosewood Mayakoba, it is one of the best resorts in the region from a design perspective. All signs indicate that you\u2019ll be treated well if you\u2019re just vacationing. But if you\u2019re planning a wedding, be prepared for overturned agreements, slow responses, and treatment like you\u2019re intruders of the hotel, and you\u2019ll need to be accommodating the hotel, not vice versa. And this is the subpar service we get, with our commitment to five star prices and room block requirement of 40 nights for 40 guests. Our experiences at the Mandarin in New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong Landmark, had all been excellent (service, food, and design-driven spaces were a winning combination), so we\u2019re excited to visit the MO in Riviera Maya in early February, thinking that its natural, chic ambiance and beach location will be perfect for our beach wedding (compared to the more traditional luxury at the Four Seasons and Ritz in Maui, and Four Seasons Biltmore in California). Our two-day visit at the resort had been pleasant and relaxing. Our hosts of the visit, the wedding advisor Roxana and Maurizio had been friendly, laid-back, and agreed to many of our requests with ease. We came back happy with our choices (including two other resorts we had visited), but had to wait a week for the diagnostic report of an important family member who is ill, before deciding. In the meantime, we had started asking questions we had on the contract, but all responses were made by the sales director, rather than Roxana and Maurizio, whom we had been in contact with. This was fine, thinking that maybe this is so because we\u2019re discussing the contract. But we noticed that each response came back much slower than before, the longest being 9 days, excluding the week when she asked us to wait while she went on a trip. It was fine at first, thinking that she might be busier or it might just be the beach culture, but after a month we\u2019re still not signed and still waiting, it started to feel like irresponsibility and disinterest. Even during our family member\u2019s illness, we\u2019re quicker to respond than she was. This is not the way to treat a client who is ready to sign. At this time, the worst came. After waiting for 9 days, we emailed her to touch base, only to get the response that expressed her apology, for ceremonies on the beach cannot start earlier than 5pm, and cocktail reception must begin after 6pm, according to hotel regulations. This is the first time she mentioned these timing, after Roxana agreed during our site visit that ceremony starts at 4:30pm (written on the proposed contract). And this is after I told her that the sunset time in the region on our date of choice (in November) is estimated to be 5:07 PM, and so we requested to change the ceremony to 4pm. How can any hotel ask their wedding guests to start the ceremony 7 minutes before sunset, let alone a 5-star hotel?? Even if the kind Roxana had made a mistake by agreeing to 4:30pm, the hotel should have corrected it immediately after, but not wait 4 weeks! Regardless, the hotel should have honored the agreement, because the employees represented the hotel, and we should have been able to trust them. We visited the venue to discuss such details and get a feel of the service level, so it should have been a honest reflection for services to come. Through my own research and experience of my friends, a beach wedding should typically start about 1.5 hours before estimated sunset, to account for any delays, and allow for enough time and lighting for the photo session after. Many beach resorts provide sunset information to the guests and advise wedding guests to schedule their agenda around this. But not the Mandarin, they\u2019re working as though they had never hosted a wedding in November. And they are completely ignorant of the wedding guests\u2019 schedule and experience. We decided to email the sales director again, expressing our thoughts politely, hoping to give the project one last try. This time she told me that she went and pleaded to the general manager, but in order to start the ceremony at 4:30, they must set up the ceremony on the left end of the beach. Another agreement she\u2019s trying to overturn! During our site-visit, we noticed how narrow the beach was in front of the Mandarin. So we immediately asked Roxana if we could set up our ceremony as far to the right as possible (where the beach is wider), away from the pier on the left end (because we wanted a clean backdrop) and away from the sunbathers, and she pleasantly agreed. She only told us, but not too close to the beachfront carsitas (villas located on the further right side of the beach). This is understandable, especially after we read the complaint on this site about weddings being too noisy for the carsita occupants. Why did she need to \u201cplead\u201d to the general manager to allow a wedding ceremony to start just 30 minutes before sunset? Why does the sales director have to \u201cplead\u201d to honor a previous agreement, to help a wedding run smoothly? Whatever happened to the five-star service that they promised on the wedding brochure? Each standard request we had seemed to be an uphill climb. Despite the prices that we\u2019re paying, we\u2019re treated like intruders to the other guests. Yes, the beach is small, something that the hotel is familiar with. How can they provide wedding services if they cannot accommodate wedding parties and hotel guests at the same time? With respect to other guests, the location we requested was the unused space on the beach between the carsita front and the sunbathing lounges. But the sales director had the nerve to ask us to be responsible for any complaints they may encounter, and she warned that the price is large. The hotel isn\u2019t even fit to advertize wedding services if they actually think this way! It\u2019s their responsibility to accommodate both, and we shouldn\u2019t be treated like intruders! This is unacceptable, and not the kind of service that the Mandarin is known for. We decided to make one last attempt to \u201caccommodate\u201d the hotel. We offered to rent the beachfront carsita, in order to set up the ceremony in front of the carsita 1.5 hour before sunset, without disrupting other guests. $3800+ to rent the carsita for two nights, was the price we\u2019re willing to pay to buy time. My friend joked that I make a better employee for the hotel, because I came up with proposals to encourage sales and I'm loyal, not to mention that we\u2019re paying too. As a designer I\u2019m a total softie for simple, clean design.

The staff was warm and welcoming. We were delighted with the comfort and beauty of our room. It was spacious and had a completely private outdoor area with a dining set, two cushioned beach chairs, and a private outdoor bath/dipping pool. We had a lovely view of a cenote - out of which iguanas, tropical birds and the most beautiful butterflies would make daily appearances. I cannot express how helpful, courteous and accomodating the staff was.

Each night at the spa, the attendant created a 1 on 1 routine for me, depending on how much time I had. The servers at the pool/beach remembered our names and each hour or so would bring us different snacks and drinks to try. They perfected the balance of always being there when we wanted them to be, but never being overbearing or intrusive.

He said he would wait outside the hotel for us.

I travel 20 days a month abroad my country for business and I normally stay in very high-end properties, from Four Season to Ritz Carlton to Peninsula hotel as well as One and Only resorts.I never wrote on trip advisor but this time I feel forced to do it. People must know what is going on at the resort. We arrived at the hotel on the 14th of August and we were so excited because I have been staying in other Mandarin Oriental hotels and I was sure that this was going to be superb. The resort is a long stretch from the main road to the beach. Is very narrow and long. When we arrived, check in was very smooth and quite fast. Got upgraded because the stay was book thru my AMEX Centurion card travel service. Staff was very nice and friendly which is the only good thing about the resort. Everybody do theirs best to make things nice, even if at the end everything makes this effort vane. We arrived to the room which was quite nice with a beutiful bathroom and a view over a sort of pond. Till now impression was very good and we were still very excited. All the excitment ended when we reached the beach. The hotel is falling apart. Everywhere you see any metal you will find rust and pieces missing. The beach has a restaurant which few days ago lost part of the ceiling and even if I told staff about it no one would do anything to repair it. Another part of the roof is going to fall soon as well but this time will probably hit someones head because is just over the deck where you can have breakfest and lunch. All wooden floors are scratched and bad conditions. The beach which is an average one is only cleaned once a day around 9.00 o clock am. Now this would be ok if it wasn't that it rains many times a day and the sea during the storm brings along with the rain a lot of junk which stays there till the next day. The resort has a sort of wooden bridge that streaches out for 50-60 meters in the sea. Well one year ago a heavy storm made this bridge dangerous. Instead of repairing it they have decided to put a plastic ribbon at the entrance with the words DANGEROUS. Now, if you by any chance have a child you must make sure that he do not get near it or probably he will get hurt as well as any adult which is not carefull. A child can get hurt 100 times in 1 day if not carefull because all over you look everything is breaking down. I have spoke to many managers because the Director of the hotel was on holidays and they all were very sorry about it and they said that sooner or later these things were going to be fixed. After a few days I learn that due to the econimic crise, the resort which is half owned by private Mexincans and the other half owned by Mandarin, have decided not to fix it. I have learned that many people at the resort have complained but nothing has been done. I have taken pictures of what I'm talking about because I dont want anyone from the resort to say that this is all a lie. Most of the sun beds were broken and left on the beach with no repair. The resort has no maintenance at all!!! Most of the days it rained and lot of water go into the room. If you flush the toilet you will not be able to use the shower or the sink because there is no enough water due to the fact that they have used small pipes. I have learned that when the resort first opened everyday they had lots of issues with the water in the bathroom. The resort has 2 main restaurants for dinner which are very good. Food is fresh and very tasty but the menu are very limited which would not be a problem if they both were opened all days. We had to eat twice in the room at dinner because the restaurant that we liked closed for 2 nights and we didn't feel like eating what the other one was offering. I wonder how a resort which is very far away form everything can allow 1 of the restaurants to close. Again lots of guest were complaining also of this. As many resorts, transportation is taken care by golf carts. Every time that you need 1, you just need to call the front desk and they will send one. Well this sounds absolutely normal if it's wasnt the fact that you had to wait up to 15 min for them to pick you up. The reason is that because we were not many guest they only had 1 golf cart which was working. If you are a person on a wheelchair DONT GO!!!! They have not thought about you and the problem this could cause. You will not be able to go to the pool or to the restaurant at the beach for dinner unless you think is ok that someone has to carry you up the stairs. I could go on and on about what was not working, so many things are not working that makes you crazy. I do not have any personal reason to write this bad review but if someone else wrote this when I had to decide where to stay I would have been very greatful. ALL THE THINGS THAT I'M MENTIONING ARE ON MY PICTURES!! Next to the resort there is a Banyan Tree resort which looks very good and it seems that they care much more about details. The only 2 things that I want to mention which have been great are the staff, always smiling and professional and the diving center which is well organized and with very good instructors. If you are used to FOUR SEASON resorts or ONE AND ONLY resorts or any very high end property dont go to this one. You will be disappointed. For what i concerns the cost of extras I would say that they are ok except for the cost of the tours which are incredibly expensive. I wanted to go to Chichen Itza with the hotel car and they asked around 675 USD plus taxes or hotel transfer from and to the airport for 275 USD plus taxes. I rented a car and drove to Playa del Carmen and Tulum as well as Cancun. Driving is so easy because is all one 1 straight road. You cannot make any mistake but if you don't feel like driving because afraid of the way they drive just ask for a taxi. Very safe and nice. Internet is 25 USD a day plus tax. I wonder how in a resort like this they can still ask to be paid for the WIFI after all the money you give them for the stay. If you need private transportation just go on the official web site of Cancun airport and they sell private and very serious transportation with SUV and private driver for 110 USD round trip. I wrote a letter also to the Mandarin Headquarter but till now no answer, maybe they think that i was saying a bunch of lies in order to get something back but I hope that they will soon send someone over there to see as well what is going on. Again, I never wrote any review about any resort or hotel I have been to, but this time I really wanted people to get the picture of how it is. THIS IS THE TRUTH!!

BUT they have constructed two filthy lakes which are meant to have crocodiles but only breed mosquitos. We could not stay or relax outside after 4pm because mosquitos would attack us. We have travelled around the world in mosquito sensitive parts of the world but this by far is the worse and the hotel deserves full blame for this. On top of that unlike other luxury hotels based in mosquito infested areas the hotel did not provide us with any repellents etc - staff nice but efficiency very poor: they had to pick us up to the room to bring us to the restaurant/reception as the hotel is quite long - waiting time was long and at times we were left to wait outside for more than 20mins. - food was good, very expensive, which was fine as the quality was one of the best in that part of town - Nightlife was fun at playa del carmen was good. Now to go into some major details which i can assure has convinced me never to stay at a mandarin oriental hotel despite being a big fan of all their city hotels - Concierge, She failed to recommend a single decent restaurant we could dine at. We were visiting during new years time and she sent us to a restaurant with 50 tables the first night and zero people dinning. We asked for a rental car to be arranged. We were told at 10pm the car will be there at 7am. We planned our whole day and the hotel failed to give us any update till 10am and than we were told the car was NEVER arranged. Concierge gave us completely wrong cab fares and all cabs were willing to charge half the price we were told and that didn't involve in bargaining. We eventually gave up and arranged all booking through a local taxi driver and internet - Bill. We were double charged for our bill and after this dreadful experience it took us 2 months to receive a refund where the hotel was convinced we weren't double charged and we had to send them proof 2 times. - We had to ask for our taxi to the hotel to be booked 3 times as front desk kept forgetting about it - Yoga classes were fun but regardless of the level they say all levels were similar so i highly recommend not doing them as a beginner. All in all i would say mandarin oriental has tarnished their reputation in hotel management by opening this hotel.

I see some reviews here suggesting otherwise, but I really felt like this was a couples hotel above all else. When we were there, my 4-year old daughter was one of TWO kids at the entire resort. (And we rarely saw the other child) The suites do not have a separate bedroom which is not great for families. The kids center was very small (though the staff was wonderful). And the bathtub has to be started by the hotel staff (who wants to wait 20 minutes for a staff member just to give their kid a 10-minute bath?) which was really bizarre. The hotel is gorgeous and the staff did the best they could to accommodate us, but so many things just weren't kid-friendly. That's perfectly fine, but then they need to change the way they market themselves. In my opinion, Four Seasons sets the standard when it comes to creating an upscale atmosphere that caters to EVERYONE, including children. I suspect that is what Mandarin Oriental is going for here, but they really missed the mark.

Our daughter is 5 years old and was excited about the kids club. The website specifically \"At Mandarin Oriental Riviera Maya all the family will be able to enjoy a holiday. Our Little Fans Club provides stimulating entertainment, with imaginatively thought out creative activities and games, keeping young children occupied throughout the day.\" Their site also goes on to state: \"Please advise us of the age of your children and we will be delighted to organize a welcome pack for them and ensure appropriate sized robes and slippers in the room.\" We booked our room through American Express Centurion. Our confirmation information that had MO cc'd on it specifically stated we had a 5 year old and would need a roll away bed. We arrived late and room was not set up this way. The resort did immediately remedy even providing a cute doll for our daughter. The next morning we went to the kids club. It was closed. We kept asking staff about it and after about an hour or so of waiting a manager came to say it was closed because the girl who worked it needed the day off. After noticing our frustration and my repeated request that this was acceptable, the hotel clearly understood and our butler ended up staying with our daughter and even going out on the beach to fly a kite. We would have been fine watching our daughter, however after many visits to resorts with kids club she loves them and gets very excited about attending. Once she saw the room with all the toys, arts and crafts, video games, etc it was hard for her not to want to play. I would have expected the hotel to have been on top of both of these items due to the expensive rack rate and nature of this type of hotel. When paying 5 star prices I expect 5 star service. They did remedy, however both times after our daughters disappointment. The girl would worked the kids club showed up the next day and was fantastic and the rest of the stay worked perfectly. We had a beachfront casita with rooftop pool. The pool was freezing. There was no way you could swim in it. Further, our pool lights did not work which really were needed if you were to enjoy the roof top at night. We requested this to be fixed on 3 occasions and it never was attended to our knowledge. It never did work and we were never told that it was out of service for good due to a larger problem. The room was great. Layout very nice. View was amazing. My husband and I wonder if this was a hotel that the MO came in and renovated. For being only a few years old it seemed pretty dates. Lots of rust spots on the outside, tile nicked or cracked in spots, etc. I am curious if we are correct. The beach here is gorgeous and we had beach chairs right in front that they set up daily with towels. The pool was also very nice and the staff very attentive. I went to the spa for a massage. Very nice. We also used the gym and it was very nice as well. Very spacious with nice cardio and weight machines. Also, there is a nice area with a few mats for stretching, etc. The food was great at both the poolside restaurant and room service. It was right on time and staff very accomodating. I did not find the prices to be too high given the nature of this type of hotel. We did not find the conceirge to be overly helpful. If you want to do anything off the property they recommend tour companies. We wanted to go snorkeling in Alkumel with the help of a taxi and I figured this out using TA, not the hotel. They really were not very helpful in this regard. Finally, they gave us a bill to check the morning of our departure. It all looked fine and I called the front desk to let them know. When we went to leave they handed me an envelope with the final copy. We were in a hurry to get to the airport and I did not look at it until we were in the car to go. They had put on the final bill about an additional $200 worth of honor bar charges. I do not think this was accurate, however by the time we finally got home it was water under the bridge and really was such a small amount in comparison to our overall trip. More frustrated that I felt taken advantage since they didn't point out that it was different than the one I had approved. If we would return to this area I would stay at this hotel if they were offering a discounted rate. We did get one night free b/c we booked x amount (can't remember now what the number was).

My girlfriend and I stayed at the MO Riviera Maya for a week at the beginning of May. It was our first vacation together and I really wanted it to go well. The MO helped make it a very special stay which neither of us will forget! We were met at the airport by he hotel driver and taken to the hotel in an Escalade - the water and cold towels in the car were very welcome. Check in was a breeze. We were offered several kinds of cool fruit juices as the receptionist took down all our preferences and gave us an orientation of the hotel. We were then whisked off to our Beachfront Casita. I have to say that these are not cheap rooms but they are entirely worth the expense. The room was huge and literally steps from the beach with a deck overlooking the beach. Large palm fronds in front of the deck ensured privacy from the beach while still giving us a great view of the blue blue ocean. The bathroom had a really large tub fro two, a separate two person walk-in shower and a large changing area also for two. However, the really great thing was the rooftop infinity pool overlooking the ocean with our own sun beds and loungers which were made up with towels and pillows every day. The beach was about 15 feet from our room. Beachfront casitas come with their own specific beach loungers. These were made up for us every morning before we arrived and strategically set between two large coconut trees on the beach in front of our room. The beachside staff were great. Every time I waved, someone would literally run over to get our order and they were always moving the umbrellas to make sure we had shade when we wanted it (I would like to make special mention of our beachside servers Edgar, Jose Luis, Catalino and Wilfred but they were all great). The food at the beach bar was good - ceviche and sushi rolls. Drinks were better - the Mandarin Sidecar being our favorite. The hotel was definitely not at full occupancy so we pretty much had the beach and pool areas to ourselves which suited us fine. Every morning we would order breakfast, then go for a swim in the ocean and by the time we were back, breakfast was set up for us on the deck. We spent most of our days on the pristine beach. Two afternoons we took a snorkeling trip and a scuba diving trip to some really pretty reefs (apparently the reef off the Riviera Maya is the worlds second longest coral reef after the Great Barrier Reef in Australia). We also took a trip to Tulum which was great - go in the morning because they close at 4pm and they have a great beach. We also had spa treatments on our last day and I wish I had done that on our first day. The spa facilities were excellent and we could have spent much longer there. In the evenings, we either ordered room service (which was good but limited) and ate out on the deck or went to the Ambar restaurant. A special note on Ambar. I am somewhat of a foodie and to be honest, I wasn't expecting much from the food at a resort. Ambar totally proved me wrong. The food was inventive, flavorful and perfectly cooked. Now this may be because we also had the restaurant pretty much to ourselves on the nights we were there but again that suited us fine. It was then great to come back to the room, go up onto the roof and watch the stars from the infinity pool. We slept like babies to the sound of the waves. All in all I had a thoroughly relaxing and luxurious stay at the Mandarin Oriental and I would definitely go back (and I would definitely get the Beachfront Casita again). Its a very expensive place to go but if you want to be pampered in a world class resort this is definitely a great place.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stanton, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service\u201d", "Author": "USTraveller123", "ReviewID": "UR66100469", "Content": "This is a very good hotel. Of the high-end places I've stayed in the area, I'd rate it better than the Ritz Carlton, and at the same level as the Banyan Tree and LeBlanc. Actually the service at the Mandarin was the best of the group. We stayed in a Selva Suite. I liked the room a lot. It was private, well-designed, and comfortable. The room blended in well with the \"jungle\" outside, and included both warm and cold dip pools. The service was among the best I've encountered anywhere -- reception, concierge, the people in the restaurants and bars, the people who cleaned the rooms, they were all good. Management did a good job of selecting and training staff. I've generally found hotel butlers useless and annoying. That wasn't the case at all here -- Rodrigo's suggestions as to things to do were actually worthwhile and not just an attempt to sell hotel services, and he saved us a good bit of time dealing with administrative matters. Special mention also goes to security and to the honesty of the staff. The hotel made the mistake of leaving a complimentary bottle of champagne in our room one evening, and both my girlfriend and I ended up leaving pretty lit. She left 15,000 pesos in her bathrobe, and I left the safety deposit box open. When we returned, security had cordoned off our room, because the night maid had noticed that the box was open. Nothing was missing from it when we returned. The bathrobe had ended up at the hotel laundry, where security found every single peso. I liked the set up of the beach and the pool and the facilities around them better than other hotels I've stayed at in the area. It was nice not having to deal with crowds, which has been a problem on occasion at the Ritz and Palace resorts. It was semi low season when we visited though (Memorial Day weekend in U.S.) The fitness center was good. Wireless internet in the room worked well. The place is very spread out. This has its pluses and minuses. If you want to ride the elevator and 5 minutes later be at the pool or beach or restaurant, this isn't the place for you. If you like to walk or if you don't mind waiting on the carts and enjoy having some privacy in a habitation that blends in with nature, then you'll probably like the place. Realize that it is hot and humid parts of the year, which may make a difference in how much you're going to enjoy walking. But, again, there are the electric carts. The one item that needs improvement is the food, the quality and price. I've paid for overpriced, above-average food at other high end hotels in Mexican resorts. The problem at the Mandarin Oriental, the food wasn't above-average, and the price was as high or higher than restaurants in comparable hotels. Another reviewer suggested renting a car, to be able to go to restaurants in Playa del Carmen and see the sites. I'd agree with that, although I can't recall having a truly memorable meal at any restaurant in Playa del Carmen. Maybe I'm just picky. I would recommend you try the restaurant at the Banyan Tree next door, in particular if you like oriental food. The Tom Yum Goong there was the best I've had anywhere. A couple of other items, if management ever reads this -- as others have pointed out here, providing bicycles to people who want them, like the Banyan Tree, would be a good idea. Also, given that there's no business center yet, adding a printer to the public computer would be a good idea.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oyster Bay, NY", "Title": "\u201cAh, wonderful Mexico!\u201d", "Author": "Tripreviewergirl", "ReviewID": "UR65500704", "Content": "This is our forth time back to the Riviara Maya area.

The first part of our trip was to the Ritz Carlton in Cancun, where we were treated with personal service by a staff that truly cared about our satisfaction. After one day at the Mandarin, with people who ignored our every request, and management that tried to justify the staff's dismissive attitude by noting that it was simply our \"perception\" I wanted to burst in to tears and wished dearly that we had never left the Ritz Carlton. Being frequent travellers, we are very aware of the levels of service that can be expected throughout the world. The staff at the Mandarin Oriental Riviera Maya was outright rude, and could not meet simple requests for Housekeeping Service, Transportation, or general reservation requests. All of these things on their own would be less significant if they were not compounded by an acting manager who kept us waiting for at least 30 minutes on one day, and failed to show up to a meeting on the next. Although we expected a proactive response from the Corporate office upon our return home, it took 30 days of follow up emails and phone calls to get an answer, and in the end we were offered the opportunity to make another reservation at an equally overpriced rate during the low season. Please know our issues are not just our perception, but we spoke with several other guests during our trip who had very similar problems with the service and availability of the amenities at this resort. My warnings to fellow travellers are: - 16% service charge on top of all other rates and fees that is supposed to cover service that is terrible- totally unjustified - Be prepared to walk because it is very difficult to catch the promised golf cart to navigate the large resort - You can better count on the surrounding resorts to help you with transportation between the Mayakoba area. Mandarin promises an Escalade or similar but we were offered a small questionable taxi on more than one occassion. - The concierge is as useful about the surrounding area as Google. You may as well explore blindfolded as they have no recommendations outside their resort. - If you do plan on utilizing the outlets at the resort don't assume they will be open. Most were closed during our visit despite the high season. - Service in the beach and pool area is very limited and slow although the area is beautiful. We had better luck walking down the beach to a neighboring resort where we got great service, and staff rotated the area cleaning sunglasses, serving cold fruit, etc... Mandarin obviously doesn't feel the need to go above and beyond. The general attitude was of entitlement and lack of urgency. I highly recommend if you are staying in Riviera Maya choose a neighbor such as the Banyan Tree or Rosewood, or stay in Cancun at the Ritz Carlton, where they will really make you feel at home. Here is our letter to the company which received no appropriate response: \"My husband and I have just returned to our Texas home after a very disturbing stay at your Riviera Maya property. We would greatly appreciate a personal conversation with yourself or someone at the appropriate level to address the very disconcerting experience we feel should be urgently addressed. Because it is fair that you have some background information prior to speaking with us I will give you a brief description of our concerns. Our initial impression was during a dinner we had at Ambar on Sunday, January 3rd. During our dinner we asked several times for information on room availability because we were so intrigued by the beauty of the resort. Unfortunately after several attempts to make a reservation on site we were told by the concierge on the way out to call the 800 # the next day. Since we are both in the hospitality business, we found it curious that our reservation wouldn't be handled on site, especially since we were offering our credit card right away to book a suite. Perhaps this should have been a warning to us. Rather than calling the 800# the next day we called the resort and requested to speak with a manager and received a call back from Mr. Fernando Gibaja. While we were enjoying a wonderful stay at the Ritz Carlton Cancun, where we normally stay, we expected an elevated level of service comparable to the incredible decor of the Riviera Maya resort, and in line with Mandarin Oriental's reputation. Mr. Gibaja was helpful in getting us a reservation for three nights (January 5 - 8, 2010) and transporting us from the Ritz Carlton. We felt that Mr. Gibaja handled our call gracefully and we were excited to experience your resort. Unfortunately we never heard from Mr. Gibaja again, and learned during our stay that the General Manager (Patrick Dennis Finnet) was no longer employed at the resort. Perhaps the breakdown in management contributed to the many breakdowns in service we experienced. Unfortunately that does not excuse them. Upon our arrival on Tuesday, the 5th, our excitement was quickly squashed. After experiencing several distressing service issues each day we requested to speak with a manager only to be pacified or ignored by front line staff members. On our final day we spoke with the Assistant General, \"Fred\", who never followed up with us or addressed any of our issues. Some of the issues included being ignored by staff, no service in the restaurants or pool area, incomplete housekeeping services, not being offered any information about the resort's outlets, etc... When Fred did speak with us, very briefly, we were told that our issues were simply our \"perception\" of the resort. In addition, he made the assumption that we had a problem at the Ritz Carlton, which could not be further from the truth. In fact, we were sad to be at the Mandarin, where we were ignored, not greeted, and dismissed when requesting help rather than spending our last few days with the warm, caring, willing and attentive staff at the Ritz Carlton. While the resort is stunningly beautiful and the room product beyond compare, the staff attitude, carelessness, and dismissiveness of the management was certainly not in line with what earned this property it's 5 diamonds; nor was it in keeping with Mandarin Oriental service expectations. I can assure you it was not \"gracious and sincere and steeped in the values of the orient\" as your mission indicates. \"", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Valentine's Day Escape!\u201d", "Author": "Becky91681", "ReviewID": "UR57205277", "Content": "We stayed at the Mandarin for 4 nights over President's day weekend.

Sorry to say but we were very disappointed and will not go back. For a new hotel built less then 2 years ago it just didn't seem very new looking at all. It seemed unkept actually and like the staff was neglecting it. The lawn care and gardening should have been better, there were lights out all over the property, one section of the long pathway smelled like sewage and we had water temperature problems in our shower. We had a palaofito room which was very nice and close walk to the beach but while taking a shower our water would get burning hot every 5 seconds! Very dangerous especially if you have kids. We complained about this problem 4 times before maintenance finally tried to fix it and they couldn't. They offered us a different room but we didn't take it because it was in the middle of the property and we liked the location of our room because unless you are by the beach you are in for A LOT of walking. The property is long and narrow and a far walk from the lobby or spa to get to the beach. We are young and very active so we didn't mind so much but I could see how this would be terrible for people not looking for exercise on their vacation.

Ceviche is the only lunch option and we did not care for that menu at all. Not enough options. My husband and I don't eat ceviche or sushi so after that the options are very limited. We would walk on the beach to other hotels for lunch. The spa was beautiful but that was also a disappointment because the steam room was broken 3 out of the 7 days we were there and both the men and womens side!

I have never had a worse experience in my life. We had a wedding here and I would strongly urge if you are considering a wedding, please do so at the Mayakoba/Rosewood, Ritz Carlton, or the Tides. Our guests had to endure no running water and had to be shuttled to the spa to take showers, the A/C at the resort does not go below 78 degrees (our elderly guests got ill) -they bring fans in, the toilets overflowed in several rooms on a \"more than once\" a day basis, a piece of the concrete fell out of the wall in one of the guest suites and almost broke someone's foot, a guest was locked out of their bedroom for a half hour after the turn down service came in and did something weird to the door! The management will not work with you to negotiate anything, and they are not short of being sleazy and uncooperative. The General Manger rides around on a motorized bicycle that says \"The Boss\"-if that says it all. In staying at the Tides-which is a beautiful, 5 star service oriented resort, I was shocked that the Mandarin fell short of even coming close to a 5 star. We stay on a normal basis for travel/business at the Four Seasons, Taj, Ritz Carlton, Loews, Mandarin US, etc on a regular basis-and this was HORRIBLE. We are not the type of people that ever complain... In fairness, the food was okay and the service was ok, but the infrastructure and engineering of the resort was terrible. Please check out other resorts if you want to venture to Mexico-which considering the swine flu and the drug cartel issues-they haven't slashed prices too much and will not work with you to upgrade on rooms/deals, despite what you may think..... Please reconsider your choice and never have a wedding here....The experience that we had here was unacceptable and management would not work with us in a friendly manner-after bringing in a group of four CEO's in our party to meet with the GM, he would not negotiate and said what he said goes and that's it b/c it's his property! We had to get a US Mandarin on the phone for assistance with the matter. It was a sickening experience and I cannot stress it enough what they put us through. Our wedding was the second one they've ever done here, and the wedding coordinator of the Mandarin, the GM, and the Resident GM made it as unpleasant as they could and tried to cheat us on price to make up for the bottom line on the money they are losing. The occupancy rate when we stayed here was 35% and they would not upgrade the bride and groom to a suite-we were charged and asked to sign a contract paying an additional 1500 a night..... When we did upgrade, there was no AC working in the room and bathroom and my stylist and makeup artist I brought from the US could not work in those conditions-six additional fans were brought into the bathroom/vanity area and the electric fuse blew..... I was unable to get ready in my room..... We changed rooms three times while being there! I could go on and on, but you get the drift.... If you are looking for a Mandarin and are traveling from the US, keep it in the states.... We were disappointed and so were our guests...

We were celebrating our anniversary here and we were treated like royalty!!!! We got a free upgrade to Palafitos Premier room and received more than one complementary bottle of wine... it was amazing!! To sum up why I think this hotel was great here are some points: 1.) THE HOTEL-- this hotel is beautiful! The rooms are decorated in modern furnishings and all include a bathroom to die for! We had an outdoor tub that was filled with salts and bubbles upon your request. Also, the grounds are a natural beauty, filled with beautiful paths and scenic views 2.) THE RESTAURANTS-- we could not have eaten better!! We love sushi and ceviches and were so glad to find that the beach restaurant offered so much variety of these, they were delicious! Also, the main restaurant Ambar offered a selection of Mexican-Asian fusion dishes that constantly surprised us. You can't miss the foie gras appetizer as well!!! 3.) THE SERVICE-- The waiters at the Mandarin Oriental are among the best we have ever seen (we have been to a couple of hotels in Maldives and Asia and these were even better). Also, they arranged a private dinner at the beach to celebrate our anniversary which turned out beautiful. Everyone also called us by our name!! 4.) THE SPA--- THIS IS A MUST!! We were extremely astonished by the facilites at the spa. The vapor room, the sauna, the massage pools, the experience shower.... the couple's room for a massage. This Spa is among the best in all of Latin America. If you are a spa lover, this is the hotel for you!! Finally, the last thing that made our stay amazing was the fact that the hotel was fairly empty. I know that this is bad for the hotel industry but it was AMAZING for us!! To all of those wondering if it is safe to travel to the Mandarin Oriental Riviera Maya-- it is!!!! And... best of all is that if you travel soon, you will have even more privacy and facilites ALL FOR YOURSELVES!!! p.s. they are offering amazing offers (nights free, resort credit) so take advantage of it, who knows how much longer it will last!!!", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan", "Title": "\u201cLuxury on the Mayan Riviera\u201d", "Author": "MK2009Manhattan", "ReviewID": "UR30314362", "Content": "I recently spent 5 luxurious days at the Mandarin with a group of friends, and the hotel certainly lived up to my high expectations.

We spent one day at Chichen Itza with a wonderful and very knowledgeable guide (Vicente) that the hotel arranged for us.

Being familiar with Mandarin Oriental's standards, I knew I would have a wonderful time, that the property would be beautiful and the service excellent. However, from beginning to end, everything about my time there exceeded my expectations. Although I enjoyed the beautiful and luxurious accommodations, the gorgeous grounds and the spectacular views, it was all the little thoughtful touches taken that made my stay so special. More specifically, when I arrived at the hotel and got out of my car, a woman greeted me, offered me a cool, wet washcloth and escorted me to the front desk. After being seated, I was offered my choice of assorted fresh fruit juices to drink during the checking in process. My driver then drove me on the cart to my room, acting as tour guide along the way. Each person along the way knew it was my birthday and made a point of wishing me a happy birthday. My room was very simply but beautifully appointed. The bed and sofa were comfortable, the amenities (Bulgari) were lovely, and the entertainment system was excellent (in addition to the usual cable offerings, you can also watch dvds which you can get from the concierge or plug in your ipod). The deck overlooked the lagoon, where, reportedly crocodiles live although I did not catch a glimpse of them during my 6 night stay. The upper deck had two lounge chairs and a view of the ocean and I could see all the way to Cozumel. The service level was incomparable. I was traveling with one of my sisters who is allergic to onions and garlic, which are difficult to avoid in Mexican cooking. When we informed our server of this dietary restriction, he took down my sister's name and clearly informed other staff because every other time we went to the restaurant, they were aware of this restriction. Without our asking, when we ordered guacamole, the kitchen sent out an additional serving of guacamole made without garlic and onions so that my sister could also eat. The staff at the pool in particular were very friendly and attentive to our needs. Without hovering, they always seemed to be available when we needed anything. I highly recommend the spa at the hotel. There are a wide variety of treatments available and the attendants there are terrific. Again, the staff was very attentive, explaining all the facilities and recommending heat and water therapies to enhance whatever treatment you choose. In particular, the Vitality Pool was a refreshing experience. I know some people had issues with the length of the resort, but I was not really bothered by it. I was in a Premier Palafito room, which is quite close to the beach. Almost every day, I walked to the business center located in the lobby of the hotel or the gym (very close to the lobby) and it took about 10-15 minutes. However, drivers in golf carts patrolled the camino principal (the route that runs from the lobby throughout the resort to the beach) regularly and you can also call to have a cart pick you up at any time. It is clear that a lot of thought and attention to every detail was given to make this a luxurious resort. I had an amazing, memorable experience.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201chumungous, minimalistic, fair\u201d", "Author": "luxustussi", "ReviewID": "UR28198234", "Content": "We stayed at the MO Riviera Maya during the peak New Years week in Jan \u201809. The first impression at reception was positive but quickly turned into suspiciousness when we were driven to our room: the buggy-journey just seemed endless. Soon we realized that the resort is vast, build of several villa- and two-storey bungalow-complexes alongside a narrow path that stretches over 1,5 kilometers from reception to the Beach-Restaurant. ROOMS: Our room was by the Laguna which resembled more an excavation filled with water surrounded by two-storey bungalows. Seen that these are built in a circle, we easily figured who our neighbors were. So much about privacy. Our room had all mod cons but definitely lacking a final touch in terms of decoration. A lot of bare walls and unfilled space. The bathroom was proportionally big and space consuming, even had two showers but no bidet or indoors bathtub. The private outside bathroom-patio had a large concrete plunge-pool/bath which could only be filled by housekeeping upon request. Apart from that: no plant, no stool for towels or clothes, no table. Definitely an area to develop. GASTRONOMY: The food and drinks definitely need to increase their price/value relationship (Guacamole is $10, a Beefburger $24, a bottle of Evian $11). Cuisine is good but not amazing considering the prices. In a country where food is not expensive, it is inappropriate to see such high prices for such average offers. Seen that the resort is right by the beach there is not a huge offer on fresh fish or \u201ccatch of the day\u201d. The Ceviche Cha Cha Restaurant however offers great Ceviche and Sushi on the beach. The casual Aquamarine Restaurant by the pools is a concrete hall inspired by 70's neo-futuristic architecture. The menu for lunch and dinner are equal. The inside is very minimalistic and the music played can be acoustically straining. The more quiet outside space does not offer a lot of tables for dinner although there would be enough space for many more tables. We had to wait until a table became free and eventually ordered food to be delivered to our room which was delivered \u201chot\u201d 45 minutes thereafter. Alternatively we could have walked over to the more up-market Ambar Restaurant. A 15% service charge is added to each bill, whichever restaurant or service provided. A plus is that the MO is close to town (Playa del Carmen), the transport cost (and time) allows multiple journeys to try other restaurants. STAFF: The overall service was coming up to MO-standards. Waiting-staff is friendly but when usually one or two waiters should be responsible for one restaurant-area here everyone seems responsible for all areas \u2013 too many cooks spoil the broth. When you order the same beverage for breakfast every morning I would expect by the 3rd or 4th day for staff to anticipate this need. This all sounds very over the top and a very high bar to expect of its staff, and it is just illustrative, but their competitors do it. Also, we were told one morning that breakfast is included while it clearly wasn\u2019t. OTHER: Mandarin Oriental Riviera Maya has very \"adult\" approach. However, the week we were there, many children were present. The pool area is too small (and dangerous) for small, running, screaming youngsters. There does not seem to be enough space or activities for them to be entertained and it was clear that the parents did not want to be bothered. While the MO is not responsible for laissez-faire parenting, they need to preserve the ambience for all guests, not just for the under 10's. The beach is fairly narrow and not private. Both pools are considerably small for such a large resort so we experienced a daily battle to get hold of a deckchair on the beach. Beach-casita-guests have priority on beach-deckchairs while most other guests blocked theirs by leaving a towel or book on a deckchair in the early morning and return at a later point. This situation however changed towards the end of our stay when many guests had checked out as peak season was over. Loud music from the beach-restaurant can occasionally be alienating. On two occasions we had a saxophonist playing life music accompanied by tacky synthesizer sounds while walking around the pool - we found that really irritating and felt like being in a retirement home, not a luxury resort.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous tranqual property, great for a few days, but,\u201d", "Author": "jadesdad", "ReviewID": "UR26945870", "Content": "Second stay at this wonderful property.

This may be a Mandarin in name and pricing, but other than management, the staff, while having the best of intentions and heart, just are not up to dealing with the demands of a world class five star hotel. This is true of the pool, concierge and restaurant facilities. The only exception is the spa which has it all down pat; truly some of the most professional and competent anywhere. The other complaint is that the hotel cannot decide if it is a family hotel or a couples hotel. The facilities such as the spa and restaurants are just beautiful, but the pool area is VERY small and if filled with families, just not the place you want to spend any time.

A few mosquito on my deck made sitting outside at night tough. Deluxe Laguna rooms on upper levels have deck and views of the lagoons and rivers throughout the property. lower level rooms have small yards with lawn chairs, they views were not that great so next time I'd pay more and get a small yard to hang out in. Besides the patio deck was too hot in the daytime, no shade and too small to move loungers around if you want to get a tan. I hate the location of the Palafito rooms, no privacy, you can see right in them from the pool area and walking area. Not worth the extra money if you ask me. Some room locations closer to the lobby are nice. Mini bar prices are outrageous but I guess it's all about convenience. They give plenty of free bottled water each morning and night. Voss water on the bedside at evening turn down was nice. The GYM next to the spa offers free bottle water 24-7 so never buy water at this resort, in fact I think they offer Gatorade free there too. SPA was awesome - best Swedish massage I have ever had. Foot scrub I'd rate a c-. Men's facials c- just not good. breakfast at aqua marina - continental breakfast is terrific, lots of choices. hot buffet is an add on price and nice but nothing special. I'd go with the cold buffet. I did order a few times off the menu and the omelets and waffles are good but not terrific. Ambar - I don't really understand this restaurant. Overpriced! And trust me I love to spend money. The menu was strange and not crave-able in a Mexican climate. I've almost never been anywhere where nothing sounds good Ambar was the first. I don't see this place staying the same for long. It was dead each evening. The rooftop is a cool hip bar on the roof, it's fun and romantic. GO THERE AT LEAST ONCE. MAIN POOL at aqua Marina - They should keep screaming kids out of there, that can ruin a day of R&R. Now there were few to no kids but one bad one can and did spoil a day by the pool. By the way hotel was only 40% full the week I was there. Very quiet. ground transportation: I'm 30 something and in great shape, love to run and walk, this resort is large and it's a long walk from the lobby to the beach, about a mile I think. They have golf carts going by all the time, most are room service or gardeners and not taxis so that's a bit annoying but again I am fit and young and like to walk otherwise I'd be pissed. I do know that you can call for a ride before leaving your room and they will come right away. They could improve on the frequency of the taxi cart. All drivers are very friendly. If I have to be petty, the railings were all cracking and in major need of a sanding and staining. The resort is fairly new and looks like it's been there for years. They are going to have to keep this up a bit better. Now I am not saying it's trashed by any means I am just anal about these things. lot's of burnt out bulbs around the property, 2 in my room that I asked twice to be replaced but never happened. Room service - slow overpriced and not good. If you ever want a good steak and some great side items go over to the Rosewood next door and eat at their casual poolside restaurant. Great food and much less pricey than Mandarin. I'll be honest food at MO was not that great, good but not great. Overall would I stay here again?? Yes I would but I'd want to try out Rosewood next door too. I took a small tour that was offered when we went there one night to eat and the grounds are spectacular, but almost too overwhelming. Much bigger property than MO and if you have issues walking MO may be better. I think the rooms at Rosewood are better. Mandarian does have a smaller, more private feel after comparing the two.

The first time I stayed in a Mandarin Oriental Hotel was in Hong Kong , it was wonderful but it was like 16 years ago... then I stayed in Washington and New York and also I had a wonderful time, this time we decide to go to Mexico and when I saw that there is a Mandarin Oriental in Playa del Carmen I called and asked for the best suggestion as the hotel has very different kind of rooms... but i reserved the one I liked the most with the description I got, a lagoon room for two nights ( we jump from one hotel to another to try different concepts ) when we arrived i was shocked with the beauty of the place... I just loved it... a diver took us to our room and he explained us about the hotel and what they offer to the guests... when we got to our room it was even prettier than the pictures my husband got with our confirmation e mail. Service is excellent, food couldn`t be better, spa we loved it and the employees are extremely kind and helpful, the only comments that i have beside the good ones are the small technical issues that we had in our room and the consequences, we just wanted to relax not to constantly be contacted to remember us that we had a problem, I know we did... from the time we got there until the time we left , I felt that I was being over informed from the complaints manager the compensations we got for the problems we encountered when We were not looking for anything like that. What I liked the most is: the design of the hotel and the decoration, the spa, the spa and the spa, the small restaurant in the spa, my bed, breakfast in the garden of my room and in general we liked it a lot, and I already want to book our room for our next vacation, and for more days.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cVery Expensive Drinks\u201d", "Author": "pureshot", "ReviewID": "UR18319245", "Content": "Did not stay at the Hotel.

We had undoubtedly the finest 10 days of our lives at the Mandarin in Playa del Carmen. We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world, particularly some of the finest resort hotels in Asia and we put this hotel at the top of our list. Management is exceptional, service incredible, an amazing spa and excellent food and beverage. We felt completely spoiled from morning to night. The setting is fantastic with a nice beach on the Mexican Caribbean. The Mandarin has a first class scuba diving operation - we did reef dives as well as a privately guided Cenote dive. Parasailing, jet skis and sailing are available (for a fee). The staff is lovely and ultra attentive. The concierge was terrific in arranging a privately guided trip to Chichen Itza as well as zip-lining through the forest canopy. He was also helpful with dinner recommendations and reservations in Playa del Carmen (fun, but very touristy) and at other hotels. At the Mandarin, food and beverage is excellent and creative, but somewhat pricey. Rooms are gorgeous and fairly priced, especially during the summer. Overall, I recommend this hotel without hesitation. If you want to be pampered in ultra luxury in an incredible setting, then this is the hotel for you. I am a fan!

The staff was extremely attentive and friendly. I often wondered if there was anything I could possibly ask for, to which the answer would be \"No\". The rooms were simply amazing - not just huge and luxurious, but very interesting. We were upgraded to a Selva Villa. We had our own secluded garden with a giant outdoor tub. The resort is beautifully set among mangroves, and intertwined with cenotes, canals and lagoons. Nothing, other than thick mangrove forest is visible from the resort. Wild animals and magnificent birds are abundant. The eclectic courtyards and landscaping were stunning. Excellent food at all three restaurants, including stunning ocean views from the Aguamarine sun deck.

The hotel is so Fantastic and intimate, surrounded by mother nature with mangroves, canals, cenotes and a nice beach. I did not expect to find so many great attractions in one single place... 10m from Playa del Carmen, a charming village to get around in the evening, with shops and bars, restaurants and beautiful people. Only 30m by car from the airport, and easy access to all the major cultural attractions like the mayans archeological sites. Outside the hotel, the cenotes diving was The Best attraction I experienced. Couldn't imagine by all the photos I had seen, that it was such an amazing and pleasant experience. Really above my expectations, but you need to find the right guide for that. Ours was from the hotel, and has chosen the exact and best time to be there...when the excursionists were arriving, we were already on our way back. Just a few of us there diving...really nice. The hotel is really a secluded hideaway resort in such a place that can be crowded sometimes. The SPA is wonderful, but did not appreciate that much the temazcal...too much. Food is great, balance between the spicy mexican with the asian tastes, a great mix. Beach service is wonderful and the service is great and friendly, as you can expect in a Mandarin Oriental hotel.", "Date": "June 9, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Blue Diamond by BlueBay", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d2514172-Reviews-Blue_Diamond_by_BlueBay-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$380 - $532*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carretera Chetumal - Puerto Juarez Km 298</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514172", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b7/eb/ef/mandarin-oriental-riviera.jpg"}}
