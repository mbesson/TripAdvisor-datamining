She's been staying in Downtown Toronto and commuting to the hospital everyday. I wanted to book her a hotel closer to the hospital and called this Best Western and spoke with the manager (10:30am Friday February 3rd 2012) who told me I could not pay for the room on my credit card unless I were going to be present at check in. I told him my mothers situation and asked if I could fill out a third party authorization form and fax or e-mail a front and back copy of my credit card and ID. He told me could only charge my credit card that way if it were a \"business stay\", not a \"leisure stay\" since my mom is at the hospital. I told him I'd like to re-book her reservation under \"business stay\", to which he said \"oh yeah, what business?\" and I replied \"I'll pick any business in Scarborough\" to which he said, \"No you won't because I'll ask her for proof\". I've canceled my reservation. I've made a reservation with Delta Toronto East who faxed me the third party authorization form with no problem.

Normally when I go to Toronto we stay downtown at the Delta chelsea, but I picked this hotel primarily because it was very close to the Toronto Zoo, and we didn't have a car ( we took the train). So, to go to downtown, Yorkdale, Vaughn Mills, etc. we took the TTC everywhere, which was great. The check in was good, the room nice and clean, a good size. The bathroom was a good size and water pressure great. The hotel is right off the 401 but you really didn't hear any noise from outside. Staff was very nice. The only problem was that our fridge didn't work so on the second night I told the staff and they said if it couln't be fixed I'd have to switch rooms. Later that night fridge was still broken and we were checking out the next day, so it was pointless to switch. We did use the pool once, nice and quiet and clean, but a little cold! jacuzzi was nice, though. We did use the breakfast room every morning, the attendant was very nice and ensured everything was stocked. They had a waffle maker, bagels, toast, different kinds of eggs and sausage and pastries-the usual stuff, not really a big buffet, but really it was OK. If we were to come again to Toronto, we may stay here again, but only if it was to go to the zoo. Toronto is so big that it took a while to go from from the hotel to Downtown or whatever, like an hour and a half- that's using the subway! but then driving with a car, takes almost as long, plus you have to deal with parking, etc. Also, it's in a buisness area, so there's not a lot of places to go shop and eat, just the McDonald's down the street and the Keg. Scarborough Centre is nearby, though.

There is not much within walking distance around the hotel except for a Keg Steakhouse, but the Scarborough Town Centre (large shopping mall) is only a few minutes drive away and Sheppard Avenue, a main road in Scarborough, is just on the other side of the 401. Breakfast is decent; there were scrambled eggs and sausage in the morning along with toast, croissants, muffins, danish and a selection of cold cereals. The one waffle-maker was a popular item, so there were consistent long line-ups for that. I would have liked to see a bit more fruit in the selection. On the first morning when we had breakfast, there was a plate of watermelon, but that went really fast. I never saw any more cut fruit during the rest of my stay there. Some bananas and apples were also available, but the bananas were never ripe enough. The breakfast room is also not very big, so unless I went early, there was often no seating there and I would have to bring breakfast back to the suite. There is a meeting room on the main floor that they use as an overflow seating area for breakfast. too. I would advise people to go down to breakfast early if possible (i.e. before 8:00 a.m.) to avoid lineups and get seating in the breakfast room.

My senior citizen mother, my children and myself stayed at the Best Western Plus executive inn at 38 estate drive in Scarborough for two nights in June 2011. When we got to our room my son urinated in the toilet and flushed it, no toilet paper used and it started to overflow. I called down to the front desk and the employee advised me I would have to come and get the plunger and take care of it myself. I asked if he was kidding and he said they are a limited service hotel and there is no one to assist me. I asked if we could move rooms and he said there were no more available. I went down got the plunger and fixed the problem. Of course it happened in the middle of the night as well, but I left it until the morning. The next day I spoke to the front desk and advised them that this had to be taken care of and was not acceptable. The employee agreed and said they would have maintenance fix it before we got back to the hotel or they would put us in an equivalent room. Promises... Promises. We got back from a long day of sightseeing and the first flush of the toilet it overflows. I called down and said it was promised to be fixed, it has not been so I now want to be changed rooms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am sorry but we do not have any more of your type of rooms, but you can come down and get the plunger as we are a limited service hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What was I to do? I went down and got the plunger. I said to the employee I was not happy and she said she understood and she would not be happy either. She said that she would take 10% off our bill. I told her that that is not the least bit acceptable. I asked her why the toilet was not fixed and she said there is a note on the file saying it was. I am assuming they unplugged the toilet and did not fix the actual problem. I told her I wanted to speak to a manager and she advised there was none on duty but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cole\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will call me on Monday. Fine, up I went with my plunger to fix the toilet. On check out I spoke to the front desk again about my situation advising them I have stayed in a lot of hotels and never once had a complaint and I did not feel we should be charged for our stay at this hotel. I can take a lot, but having to plunge their toilets crosses over the line. She agreed but said it was not something she should do and I was to speak with the manager Cole. I asked if there was a note for him to call me, she said yes. Monday came, Monday went. Not surprisingly no call from Cole. I called at 4pm but of course Cole was no longer available. I asked if the message was given to Cole and the front desk advised it had been. I have searched Best Westerns web site top to bottom and nowhere does it state they are a limited service hotel and guests have to do their own plunging. In fact the web site says; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The friendly staff at the BEST WESTERN PLUS Executive Inn is ready to greet you with a smile and provide a comfortable and memorable stay. Make a reservation today and save!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Comfortable .... NO Memorable.... VERY, but not for the right reasons. So finally Cole emails me back and appologizes and offers a 30% discont to be refunded to the credit card. I had cc'd Best Western International as well and they were great. They sent me a $50 gift card that can be used at another location. I thought that plus the 30% was sufficiant enough to stop fighting with them. I emailed Cole back and told him although I did not think his 30% was enough but would tell my Mom to expect it on her credit card. I asked my Mom if it was there last week and she said no. I called Cole and left a message as well sent an email. NO RESPONSE.... called again and sent another email. Cole advised because I told him I was not completly satisfied he would not be issuing a refund and that was the end of the conversation. I emailed him back and said I wanted his supervisor and he responded with \"As previously stated no further actions will be taken at this time.\" So a short story long... stay at this hotel if you want to plung your own toilet, have no towels available at the pool or in the gym and have many broken promises. Best Western International has been great. I have stayed at many Best Westerns and never ever had this issue.

After ten minutes of waiting, they gave us another room which they claimed was the only room left that has two queen beds. The room smelt really bad, and we couldn't leave the window open to air out because it is on the first floor. We were extremely unhappy about it. I asked to move to another room. This took another 10 minutes. I think what's frustrating was that I kept getting email \"welcoming\" us to the hotel -\"looking forward to your stay\", etc. But when we got there, the room was not kept aside for us. And after a few mishaps, I thought, had I been the management, I would have upgraded the guests to perhaps another catagory of rooms to solve the problem. Instead, the front desk had us dragging our stuff up and down the noisy elevator (that's scary too!) several times. I had stayed with this Best Western twice before. But I would seriously consider staying elsewhere next time I visit Toronto.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNOT for families with young children\u201d", "Author": "jimod99", "ReviewID": "UR35307154", "Content": "We booked into this hotel with the zoo package, we have 2 children aged 2 and 8 months.

Our kids love to play in the pool and our 2 year old, who has been taking swimming lessons for a year, could not understand why she wasn't allowed in the pool, especially as this was the third hotel we had been in on a 10 day road trip and she had been in the pool in both others, incidently not Best Westerns. If this is a general Best Western rule we would certainly not stay in one again. In the breakfast room in the mormning I asked the member of staff on duty for some water to make up the babys cereal, I was gruffly told \"theres a drinks fountain outside\"!!!! We did find the staff unhelpful.

The pool area was small, but clean. Every morning while passing by the housekeeping staff we always were smiled at and greeted. VERY impressive and a great touch of class by the staff to make you feel welcome. There was adequete parking and even though we were beside a freeway, we did not notice any noise.

It was old; noteven flatscreen. Frontdesk was courteous and quick. Room was really great. has coffee maker and even has small refrigirator and a microwave oven!! Plenty of parking. I wanted to goto south-indian restaurent as we can hardly find one in Montreal. This is 15 mins from Saravana Bhavan. Though I wasnot much impressed with quality and taste of Saravana Bhavan, I have no regrets with the hotel. Took 20 minutes to CN tower; CN tower is okay; didnt feel any exhileration. What irritated us was there were no proper directions on where to start and where/what to look for. It could have been better. Took hippo bus tour; which was really cool. Though it is bit costlier, I feel it is worth it. One sour note was: In the morning, I needed another towel for my kid.
