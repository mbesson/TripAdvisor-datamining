Only available hotel close to to everything and at a good price (US$120) over weekend was Days Inn Harborview. We booked and caught a cab, no question it was close to everything from trolley tram stop to Little Italy for dinning and the harbor for some sightseeing. On arrival things looked ok till we went to our room. This manager said the room was one of their new rooms, it wasn't new it just had a new tv and appliances, therew as no mention that renovations were going on and the car-park outside room was the storage & workprep area. Well we thought that it would be okay as we planned to be out all day anyway. Just after putting our bags down in the room, my 12yo son(smaller than average size) used the toilet and it blocked up. Could not unblock it and went to reception to inform them. They said that it couldn't be fixed till the morning. I asked the managers wife who had now taken over that we had just traveled from L.A. and were not happy how things were turning out I was ready to leave. She gave me a key to another room this time on the 3rd(top floor) she said it had just been refurbished and to her credit it was brand new, never used since new paint & carpets, new bathroom, the shower curtain hadn't been put up yet. that's how I know we were first to use. They had the shower curtain up within the hour. The room turned out to be better than average, the smell of paint was very faint and a couple of hours with the door open fixed that problem. Everything worked great from the fridge to the hairdryer. Problem with the brand new in room safe, it was installed in a spot that didn't allow the door to open more than 5 inches. This would of been ok for us as we only needed to travel documents in except the opening was against the side wall so in reality you couldn't put anything in it. Complimentary b/f was good, not much variety but plenty of what there was. It all worked out ok in the end and if all of the refurbished rooms when complete are anything like ours then you will find it worth the money.
