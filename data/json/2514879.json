Unfortunately, we got confused and booked through an agency, which failed to send us any kind of confirmation - but when I emailed the hotel directly, I literally got a reply in less than five minutes. When we arrived, we discovered the agency had sold us a 'superior' room which was not available - be sure you actually contact the hotel directly for the best reservation possible. Despite that and our post-midnight arrival, the hotel staff was extremely gracious, explained that they only had a regular room available, and despite the hour, gave us suggestions for where to go in Paris. The rooms are typical, small Paris rooms, but I was pleased that both the regular room we had for three nights and the 'comfort' room we had for one night both had bathtubs. The deluxe room had a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower from the balcony, and as an apology for the hassle of switching, the hotel included a bottle of champagne for our last night. The location is great, though I recommend taking the bus/Metro from the airport, not the RER, which makes for a longer walk from the nearest RER-C stop. You want the Ecole Militaire stop on the metro. The location in the Rue Cler district was great, with short walks to food, grocery stores, Les Invalides, the Army Museum, and more. The staff was absolutely wonderful. Julia, in particular, was so friendly, gracious and helpful. She provided some excellent site-seeing ideas, booked our shuttle back to the airport and dinner reservations, and was very apologetic about the mistake regarding the room (she was the one who suggested always contacting the hotel directly). There is a mini-bar in the room, a small bar in the lobby, and breakfast in the cellar. I would skip breakfast unless you are in a major hurry - with great Parisian restaurants nearby, why eat at the hotel? Particularly when the available choices downstairs were fairly slim - eggs, some fried ham, one type of cold cuts, a few types of coffee, croissants. It wasn't horrible; but I've seen better hotel spreads elsewhere in Europe and at other hotels in Paris. Plus, good food abounds in the Rue Cler district. LIkewise, the bed was rather firm, which may work for you, or not.

It has a working elevator and air conditioning. Close to the Eiffel Tower if you dont mind the walk. Even from the 2nd floor, we had a view of the Tower. Very clean. The Bad: The rooms are so small that there is only room to store 1 suitcase. My husband and I tripped over the remaining suitcases and eachother the whole time- it got frustrating. The shower has a full tub, but the glass enclosure only covers half of the tub. Every time we showered, the water would get all over the floor, the toilet, and 2 towels were not enough to soak up the mess. The Ugly: MOLD!! We noticed that behind the wall paper, there was black mold growing next to the window in both the bathroom and the bedroom. Every time we entered the room, it had a musty smell.

However, the dissapointment set in when we arrived to the room and seen nothing but a large building under renovations. I went back down stairs and told the receptionist that I think we were in the wrong room because the room we requested, and paid extra for had a view.

The hotel is about a 10 minute stroll from the Eiffel tower, and 15 minutes from Montparnasse. The nearest metro station was only 3-4 mins away (ecole militaire) which is on line eight and seems to be very central, we only used the metro and found it very quick and easy. We had a superior room on the fifth floor (room 54) which was lovely, the level of cleanliness was excellent, the staff were all very friendly and extremely knowledgable about the area, and we certainly picked their brains enough! They gave us advise on the metro, opening times of places, restaurant recommendations (very good restaurants) and even put a half bottle of champagne and a card saying 'happy anniversary' in the room as we told them it was our anniversary, which was a lovely surprise when we got to our room. You can also book a shuttle from Charles de gaulle airport to the hotel via the hotel by emailing them your flight details, which was 36\u20ac for two, but got cheaper the more people there are. We found this very convienient as it is only about 25 mins from the hotel and much better then getting the trains. The view from our balcony was fantastic, we had the eiffel tower one way, and montparnasse in the other, it is on a main road which seems to be quite on the weekend but busy during the week, however this was not a problem as the double glazing was very good. The mini bar is very reasonably priced, and although there are no tea or coffee making facilities you can request it from reception (there is no room service as it is a little boutique so you do have to go and ask) however we didn't feel that this was a problem. The shower was really nice and powerful which is unusual but very welcome, although larger people may find there is not much space in the shower. Breakfast was really good, a very French selection of bacon and eggs, crossiants, pain au chocalat and bread with a selection of preserves and yogurts. Breakfast is self service but tea and coffee are sever by the pleasant breakfast staff, in a lovely cellar which is bright but cosy.

We both felt we could not have picked a better hotel for the view was amazing and we knew we were definitely in Paris.

We had arrived 4 hours before check in so were not expecting our room to be ready. I had emailed them to say we would be early and asked if we could store our luggage while we explored the city. To our delight the room was ready so, after our friendly hotelier assured us that if we needed any advise, or information we needn't hesitate to ask, we took THE ELEVATOR up the our room, (number 45). I can't tell you how happy the number 45 made me after reading TripAdvisor reviews I knew this was a good room. And we weren't let down.

The location is fab, close to the tower, metro and les invalides also there are so many restaurants close by to choose from. i strongly recommend l'entrecote and La Terrasse (about 2mins walk from the hotel door). The staff in the hotel made us feel warm and welcome as soon as we arrived and if we needed anything they would be on hand.

This was a suprise birthday present for her and when I was researching I wanted to find a good quality hotel close to the Eiffel Tower / Central Paris that was a decent price. BINGO. I did some searching round trip advisor and this directed me to the Hotel Duquense. A previous user had recommended Rooms 45 or 55 and if anyone wants a romantic view to add to their Hotel expereince, make contact with the hotel and ask for one of these rooms. The view of the tower is amazing. We sat in our room looking out the big windows at the sparkling Eiffel Tower literally outside the window. I asked for either room and we ended up with room 45, I think 55 might be even better! We arrived at Gare du Nord and after a short wait for a taxi outside we got a cab to the Hotel. Only a 10-15 min trip and about 18 euros should sort it. Be aware taxi's charge extra for bags so that 18 euros is a total of everything. The hotel staff were fluent in english and were really helpful for suggesting places to eat and where to head. We were only in Paris for a long weekend and may I recommend the bus tours round the city. An awesome way to see all the city and get some info about everything you see. We picked the bus up from the bottom of the Eiffel Tower (should prob say this is only a 5-10 min walk from the Hotel). You can see the tower from the hotel and its a very easy walk to navigate. The busses go round all the expected landmarks and you can get off and back on at your leisure. Also the boat trips down the Seine are great, not overly expensive but a lovely afternoon trip. We decided to go back to the boats for an evening dinner cruise, which was lovely for a romantic trip for 2. There were lots of larger tables but the food and service was great for everyone. This trip was a little expensive but well worth it if anyone wants to take their other half on a romantic dinner trip. Overall the hotel was perfect. Great staff, ideal location, clean, and friendly. There are lots of mega expensive hotels in paris but I'd say this one is very reasonably priced but also has the quality.

I chose the hotel as it was reasonably priced and definitely the nicest looking and best location out of my short list. After a short trip on the metro the hotel was a few minutes\u2019 walk from the station and easy to find. The receptionist was very friendly and check in no problem. Our friend was given a standard room with a double bed plus single and separate bathroom and toilet. We thought our room was going to be directly above his and so we were expecting the same but we had booked a deluxe room and so had a lovely surprise when we entered the room to see it was completely different layout, a little more spacious and with a balcony. Stepping out on the balcony and seeing the Eiffel Tower was unforgettable- it was unexpected and we were pretty amazed, despite having visited Paris and seen the tower a few times before. Our room was numbered but was also called Arc de Triomphe and was on the 5th floor. We weren\u2019t in the hotel for long enough to really appreciate everything but the rooms were a good size, lovely furnishings and a very comfortable bed. Bathroom was nice with a lovely rose body lotion amongst the toiletries. The reception area was contemporary and the girls on reception were really very friendly, happy and helpful. I realised two days after checking out that I had left some boots in the wardrobe so gave the hotel a call and they had them (unfortunately there had been many items left that day and so they were unable to know exactly what was left in each room, so were very pleased and apologetic when we called up!). We drove to the hotel and the boots were there for me so I was pleased! The hotel is in a great location just 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower and if like us you decide not to have breakfast in the hotel there is an amazing bakery just around the corner; we spent a small fortune in there then sat in the grounds of the tower to eat. Can\u2019t remember the name of it but was opposite a nice restaurant that I\u2019d recommend called Le Bosquet. We also went to Cafe des Officiers at the end of the road. All in all a great location and hotel to stay in Paris and i would highly recommend.

The girl on reception who always seemed to be working - was so helpful and polite - nothing ever was a problem if we asked her questions - sorry I did not get her name but she was brilliant. The rooms are rather large for European hotels and the bathrooms extra large as well. The lifts on the other hand were rather small and so we could only go up with a couple of suitcases each. The beds were comfortable and the only thing that I would complain about this hotel is that there is no tea and coffee making facilities in the room and as we love our coffee first thing in the morning, tended to find that this would be the only thing that I would suggest maybe that this hotel could provide. The added bonus was that we had views of the Eiffel tower which was great to see it lit up at night - our son really enjoyed this and even had his Ipod out the window, showing his mates back in Australia on \"talk time\". The early morning that we left the guy on reception was really lovely and when they delivered the pastries for the day - offered us all one to get us on our journey which was a really special touch as had a 12 1/2 hour flight ahead of us and with the early start to the day - made it a rather long day.

This renovation never disturbed our sleep. By now, I am sure that has been completed. The rooms are small, but quite beautiful and tastefully decorated.

Unfortunately, our stay started off with a bad experience. Prior to our trip we booked an airport pick-up through the hotel (I believe they contract out to an independent company). When we landed I contacted the driver (number given to me by the hotel). The driver advised that he was waiting for us outside of arrivals. When we got outside with our luggage he was no where to be found. I called him again and he said that he had waited for hours (totally untrue) and would not be able to pick us up for another hour. The airport information person, whose phone I was using wouldn't let me use his phone to contact the hotel as he had a line-up. We opted to take the train to Gare de Nord and then a taxi to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, the driver was there and told the woman at the front desk that he was waiting for us but we never showed up. Needless to say, after travelling for 8 hours +, we were pissed. The woman at the front desk was nice but did not do anything about it. She brushed it off and did not offer us any compensation (we didn't pre-pay so we didn't lose any money however, we booked through the hotel, so I believe they should have made up for it somehow). It was not a nice way to start off our trip which we had planned for months. Another con was that the gentlemen who work at the desk at night are completely useless and rude. To the hotel's credit...it really is a beautiful hotel. Our room was very nicely decorated and clean. The view was spectacular and the location superb. They have free internet in the lobby which was very helpful. They also had one of the best coffees I tasted in Paris.

On the plus side, the room was very clean and the bed was fairly comfortable. On the negative side, the room was extremely small, the bathroom was just okay; the towels were thin and felt like sandpaper, the small shower area had only a glass door that covered the front half of stall, and the hair dryer was low-functioning. It consisted of a device connected to the wall with a tube that blew a little air from the head, however, despite using it for some time, I was unable to get my hair dry. I think if the hotel added a few extra items, such as a room safe, a nicer hair dryer, nicer towels, a universal electrical outlet adapter, the hotel would be upgraded quite a bit. Yes, the rooms are small, but I could easily tolerate that if I had a few \"homely comforts.\" Additionally, I think it is very important for hotel staff to be accommodating and pleasant in their interactions with patrons. On our first day, we did not experience that. We called to ask for an additional wash cloth on the afternoon of our arrival, as there was only one in the room. The front desk girl seemed surprised by the request. Shortly thereafter, a washcloth was delivered to our room. The woman who delivered it seemed annoyed at being bothered in the afternoon, despite our repeated \"Merci/Thank you.\" When we left the hotel via the lobby a few minutes later, the same woman gave us a very unpleasant look (which I found disconcerting as I thought she would be cleaning our room during our stay). Fortunately, she was not. I must say that the young lady who DID clean our room was pleasant. She always greeted us with a friendly \"Bonjour\" and smile as we passed her in the hallway. She also did an outstanding job. I only wish that all staff had been as pleasant! The location was pretty good. About five blocks to the Eiffel Tower and about two blocks to Les Invalides (where Napolean's Tomb is found). Two blocks to the underground subway as well. Several cafes nearby, too. Though I requested a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower via our reservation several months prior, our room had a disappointing view of the alley way so to speak. The room is rated as a three-star, yet there are very few amenities provided and no porter to help with luggage. Additionally, the elevator barely holds one person with luggage at a time and the hallways leading to room are very narrow.

I was hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed by the comparatively low tariff - I CERTAINLY WASN'T!! Being a small, boutique style hotel it doesn't have a large front and huge signs, so it can be a little hard to spot initially. (We took a slow cruise down the avenue and spotted it reasonably easy.) I arrived into Paris on the early Eurostar train and was at the hotel by 9:45am - way too early for check in. However, the lovely and very friendly receptionist (Melanie, from memory) was very helpful in storing my luggage and looking after my laptop/DJ hardware gear whilst I joined family and visited the sites of Paris. She also offered directions downstairs to the bathroom so I could freshen up, which was a nice touch. Apart from the quality of the hotel, Melanie was a joy to be served by - so very friendly, helpful, multilingual and \"ooh-la-la\" very pretty - definitely an asset to the hotel. (Haven't felt so welcome in an accommodation premises in over a week - on the road for 40+ days.) Later on I returned to the hotel and officially checked in. This was a rather simple affair and was completed within a few minutes then off to my room via their small elevator. My room was situated on the top floor, overlooking Avenue Duquesne with a private balcony and views of the Eiffel Tower. Admittedly, the room was small and didn't allow for much free floor space, however it was sufficient and functional enough for me. It was all very clean and modern looking with reverse air-conditioning. It also consisted of a comfortable Queen bed with headboard with reading lights, two bedside tables, two wall mounted lamps, telephone, small wall mounted flatscreen TV, small desk with lamp and chair, footstool, bench seat and a wardrobe (with mini-bar, tea & coffee station, hanging spaces and a couple of shelves). The room was also tastefully decorated and thick, plush curtains covered both the glass French doors which lead to the balcony. At night the views of a lit up Eiffel Tower were splendid. The ensuite was also very small, but still practical and functional, and most importantly - very clean. It was all very bright and consisted of a toilet, towel rack, vanity sink and mirror, complimentary toiletries and shower gel, and a small shower-in-bath. The water pressure and temperature in the shower were both very good, with the only downfall being the slight lack of water containment allowing the toilet area to get moderately wet. A simple shower curtain would prevent this from occurring. The breakfast is a buffet style and costs extra. It is held downstairs (below reception) and the venue looked a bit small and cramped. However, I did not eat breakfast and only passed through the area to use the bathrooms - so there could've been more to it than what I witnessed. Unfortunately, I did not stay in Paris long enough to make the best of this hotel but what I experienced won me over, and if I ever return to Paris I would definitely stay here. Admittedly, the whole hotel from the reception and it's lobby (which has a very lovely sitting/waiting area complete with settees, chairs and coffee table) to the hallways, elevators and rooms are all quite small and compact, it all works very well. I really enjoyed my time at this hotel and I look forward to returning one day.

She gave us the room key and provided us with a map as we asked where a couple of things were that were off the beaten track. Our room was small but perfectly formed. It was a comfort room and not much view to speak of - I didnt pay for a Eifel tower view so didnt expect one. There was a small built in wardrobe, a double bed, a desk and a mini bar. I took my own travel kettle as there wasnt one in the room. There was a bathroom with a great shower and a sort of deep half bath. There was loads of hot water and clean towels - although they were a little rough and the bath towel not very large. The room was serviced daily and we got fresh towels. The room was clean and well maintained. There was free wireless in the room or a computer for use in the small lounge. The staff that we met at the hotel were friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. I didnt have breakfast at the hotel so cant comment. The location was good, not too far out with plenty of restaurants nearby. The Metro was in walking distance as was the Eifel Tower, although this was further away than I expected I would say a good 20 mins away. I woud recommend this hotel although if I was to go back to Paris I would stay in the Latin quarter but thats just a personal thing. . If you want to be near the Eifel Tower this is the place. I have no complaints and everything was good. I have to be honest - after reading the reviews on here I was expecting more but cant put my finger on what the 'more' is.

The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are modern, and the hotel is located in a quite yet centrally located area, close to the Eiffel Tower and the Latin Quarter.

The room itself was lovely, whilst it was expected that the room may be small we were fine storing luggage in the wardrobe. Presentation was nice and the bathroom was again of a good size. To anyone reading the review I strongly recommend getting a balcony room, the view is as amazing as the photos looked, waking up and going to sleep knowing the eiffel tower is just past the window makes the experience very memorable-it's good for photos to show off too.

Whilst we had plans to be up early and go exploring again it didn't really affect us to a great extent but it still wasn't pleasant. I didn't imagine opening presents to french men shouting out to each other!

After spending many, many hours searching through TripAdvisor, I selected Hotel Duquesne Eiffel based on the wonderful reviews, the lovely pictures, and the fact that they had a room with a (small, standing room only) balcony available. The staff was professional, kind, and helpful in our email correspondence prior to our arrival, and their friendliness did not diminish when we actually arrived. The ladies working reception during the day were happy to greet us with a smile and we did not feel embarrassed by our lack of French. The night clerk was very gracious about being woken up to check us out before 6am for an early flight. The hotel has an elevator which was small, but no smaller than most that we experienced in our European travels. The only mildly alarming thing was a sudden jerk as it slowed and stopped at its destination, but we put it down to a quirk of the elevator system and were happy not to have to climb six flights of stairs. The room itself, as one might expect from reading other reviews, was small - although I greatly amused my travel companion by exclaiming \"it's bigger than I thought it would be!\" It's not very well suited for people who need a lot of space or who have a lot of luggage, but no doubt the same could be said for most of the hotel rooms in Paris. The bathroom was not overly large, but the space was well-utilized and my only very minor) complaint would be that the high bathtub was a bit difficult to get in and out of. Both rooms were spotless and the maid service impeccable. We did not get the chance to try the hotel's breakfast, so cannot comment as to that. The free wi-fi was easy to use and worked perfectly, and I believe there was also a computer in the lobby available for guests who do not bring their own. Overall, we had a very nice stay at Hotel Duquesne Eiffel and the only reason we would not stay there again is that we found the 7th district too quiet for our taste, which is certainly no fault of the hotel.

From the moment we walked in we were greeted very warmly by the staff member at the reception and we were even lucky enough to check in ahead of check in time. Over the stay, the hotel was able to recommend places to go, explain to us how to get to places, book us transfers to the airport and attend to any other request we had. They even booked us dinner one night, which turned out to be great because even though reservations weren't required at this restaurant we were able to go ahead of a 45-60min wait for a table because we said we were staying at the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel.

We wanted to make sure our first experience was an unforgettable one so I researched extensively for a long time for a suitable hotel. I was very impressed with the reviews of the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel on tripadvisor. The location was exactly where we wanted to be, in a safe and friendly district, within walking distance of all the main attractions and the ultimate for me was to have a view of the Eiffel Tower from our room without paying a fortune, and to our absolute delight the hotel was exactly my dream come true and more! Thankyou tripadvisor for alerting me to this gem. We loved the fact that it was a small and intimate hotel which was another reason we were drawn to it. After an arduous delayed flight from Prague because of the snowy weather, from the minute we stepped into the lobby, we were treated with warmth and consideration. The hotel staff had organised the Airport Shuttle bus to pick us up and this was great and cheaper than a taxi. Helene confirmed that we had one of the top floor rooms, that I had been very careful to book early, with a cute little balcony(if you can possibly get one, do so) and on entering the room, we saw the absolutely stunning view of the Eiffel Tower. At night it sparkled and became even more beautiful! Yes, the room was quite small as expected from the reviews but we found it very adequate in size for our three night stay. It was well decorated and it and the tiny bathroom were spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable and cosy but who could sleep with that magic view out of the window! I was up all night taking photos! The next morning there was a dusting of snow over everything and we felt like we were in a fairy tale, coming from sunny Queensland where we never see this! We thought we would try the breakfast room the first morning and the ladies that took care of us here were delightful. The choice was limited but adequate and the selection on offer was delicious and you could eat as much as you liked. It is extra on top of the room rate, but we both felt it was good value. The cosy atmosphere and the great service brought us back again each morning of our stay. Not only Helene but all the front desk staff , including the managers Jennifer and Olivier(sorry if I've forgotten the names correctly) were so patient , considerate and helpful of two very inexperienced travellers, far from home, with very little French and I can't say enough about how they looked after us and put our minds at rest with information about things to do or how to get around. I only wish I had known that we could have booked some of our city tours through them. Keep this in mind if you would like to do this. We had booked a night tour from Australia which turned into a disaster and had returned unexpectadly very late/early morning from this tour and we were worried that because it was a small hotel, there would be no one up to let us in so we were very grateful to find the night watchman there to welcome us home! We were impressed and grateful! The lobby is a very welcoming, cosy, bright and happy area to relax or check emails(from memory, free) and it was here that we got to taste our first French Cognac! During our time in Europe, we experienced mainly five and four star hotels and I can honestly say that none were better than the Duquesne. It may not have had the size or the plushness of the bigger hotels, but we felt we got a six star experience and the hotel evokes such good memories of our trip, it became our favourite. I would never think of staying in any other hotel in Paris.

The rooms are very clean and comfortable, and the location is extremely convenient (there is a metro stop about 2 mins from the hotel, which allows access to most places throughout Paris, and there are plenty of cafes and patisseries within walking distance). The staff were friendly and amazingly helpful. On numerous occasions they helped us try to find ways to deal with flights and trains being cancelled due to the extreme weather conditions at the time, and even allowed us to use their internet facilities to book travel arrangements after we had already checked out of the hotel. The man on the desk at night even came out with us during a snow storm to help us find a taxi, even though this meant he had to go back to work quite wet! We were always greeted with a friendly smile when returning to the hotel after a day of sightseeing, and staff were always happy to help us with things that language barriers would have otherwise prevented us from doing (such as making/confirming restaurant reservations). The first room we stayed in was very small, but still lovely and a great place to stay considering that we were not there to linger in the room, but to explore the city. The second room was booked well in advance and had a view of the Eifel Tower (room 35). This room was substatially larger, and was a wonderful place to stay in order to experience the romance of Paris. It was lovely viewing the Eifel Tower twinkling every night from the comfort of our room. We specifically requested this room at the time of booking, and I would recommend that you do this well in advance of your stay in order to secure a room with this view.

The beginning of the trip was filled with me forgetting how to speak French, problems with a bank back home and general sleep deprivation. However, the one thing we did not have a problem with was the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel. From the moment we walked into the cozy lobby, we felt instantly welcomed and cared for. The staff was extremely helpful in budget-friendly restaurant recommendations as well as offering assistance in sorting out my bank issues. As jet-lagged and self-conscious as we may have been when we came in that first day , the staff was pleasant and understanding. Everyone in there was wonderful to work with. Our room was fantastic. While it did not look out on the tower, we found it to be precisely what we wanted -- comfortable bed, flawlessly clean, attractive bathroom and tub/shower combo. It is important to remember, however, that the rooms in this hotel, while well appointed, are probably not what most casual American travelers are used to. The room was small (think: larger cruise ship cabin), but that's ok. Unless you are planning on sharing one room for more than two people, the space in these rooms is perfectly fine. And after a long day of traveling, you might not even care about how big the room is so long as the bed is comfortable (which it was). The room was great and very clean. Exactly what I expect. The location of the hotel is fantastic. You are just a few blocks away from a Metro stop, Les Invalides, the Eiffel Tower and a bunch of cafes. Since this part of Paris is predominantly residential, there is a supermarket just around the corner which was a huge plus for us when we didn't feel like spending a lot for lunch some days.

The bathroom was a good size and very modern.

Jennifer at the reception desk was friendly and extremely helpful, ordering taxis, giving advice on getting places, even calling to confirm our cooking class for us as they only spoke French and we were having trouble communicating with them to confirm. We were traveling with my mother-in-law who got room 54, which was also supposed to have a view of the Eiffel Tower. Though, when we checked into the rooms, we realized that's true, but only if you step out onto the balcony to see it as it is on the side of the building. From the room windows itself you don't see the tower at all. Since we had been promised a view from both rooms, we were a little disappointed in that, especially as it was pretty cold in mid-November to be standing on her balcony to see the tower. But overall, we really liked this hotel and would definitely book room 56 again if we are ever in Paris.

The hotel itself was appealing. It was located both slightly removed - yet near enough - to all the fun stuff we were hoping to do in Paris. Near the metro, that tower thing, the Seine, Rue Cler (for the RS crowd), plenty of cafes and bars... but a short two minute walk away from where the cafes started sprouting up, meaning the hotel itself was quiet. Best of both worlds. The interior was inviting as well, a smaller hotel that had a comfortable feeling to it (as opposed to a couple larger hotels we stayed at later, in which you were one of a herd of guests) ... Nice little sitting area, big iMac for guests, quaint little bar with a nice selection of scotch if you wanted one final night cap. Our room (20?) was small - partially based upon our American POV, and partially based upon our budget, as it seems more expensive rooms might have had more real estate - but it had a very comfy bed, and (just) enough space for our stuff. We were in Paris, so it's not like we spent any time more in our room than sleep and getting dressed/ready to go out required! The breakfast room was pretty cool looking, the spread was good enough when we needed a quick and convenient meal on a day with a tight schedule. However the extra effort of springing into action earlier our second (and more open) day in town and finding a nice cafe was worth it. And, finally, the staff. We found the staff very friendly and accommodating. They spoke English well and seemed genuinely interested in us and our adventures. They had no qualms in storing our backpacks our last day in town, after we had checked out, while we explored the city until it was time to head to the train station.

Beautiful walking spaces like the promenade of Avenue de Breteuil facing the dome of the H\u00f4tel des Invalides. An area where you can see the French people walk their dogs, play their ball game P\u00e9tanque or having piquenikes.

The neighbourhood itself felt very safe even at 2am on a Friday night. The room was spotless, comfortable bed, nice view of the Eiffel Tower (well the top bit anyway) from the 2nd floor.

Because of the excellent reviews, I chose Hotel Duquesne & everything clicked perfectly into place from the very first email. I booked Room 55 (which they say is the best room in the hotel) & it may even be the best room in all of Paris, with its wrap around balcony & fantastic view of the Eiffel tower. We did an evening tour of Paris, bought some cheese, bread & a bottle of Eugene Rothschild champagne for a late night feast while watching the twinkling lights of the tower change to a diamond cascade every hour. (Many apologies to the staff for the crumbs we left behind!) Later, my cousin moved her bed so she could lie there watching the very last of the lights from her pillow. Truly a magical way to close what had been a wonderful trip through Italy & France. Room 55 cost us Euro 198 which worked out to about $NZ380 - far more than our usual budget of Euro 90 per room, but I feel for the room itself. the location of the hotel & the service from management & staff it's probably very reasonable indeed by Paris standards. I cannot speak too highly of this hotel & its staff. My emails were promptly returned & all questions answered courteously. The manager tried every way to find us a shuttle to CdeG next morning, but when this proved impossible, arranged for a taxi to take us to the RER station at Invalides instead. One hears too much about the inhospitality of the Parisiennes.

We were lucky to be able to get in to our room(#34) already for our 7 night stay. I haven't been to Paris for 25 years and stayed in dives or with friends previously, so don't know what to expect of a room in Paris these days, but it was well appointed with beautiful tasteful furnishings, a recently updated bathroom with gorgeous tiling and marble, and large sunny soundproof windows. It was me(a 47 year old male) and my 75 year old parents. They had a kingsize bed(two twins put together) and I had a single bed that acted as a sofa during the day. The room was quite spacious and we never felt cramped. I liked having the toilet room seperate and across the entryway from the bathroom(although a mini sink in the toilet room would have been nice). There was a fully stocked mini fridge(contents not free, of course) in our large wardrobe style closet next to the safe. No chest of drawers for storing clothing, but that seemed to be the norm in other hotels we stayed in other cities after Paris. I found the bathtub odd where you only had a clear glass divider that only protruded halfway out from the wall...ended up always spraying lots of water out on the floor. You only get to see the top third of the eiffel tower from the 3rd floor, and only if you stick your head out the window and look right, but it was still beautiful. The threesome rooms with a better view were already booked more than three months in advance, so book early for the summer months if views are important to you. They actually offered us a room with a better view for our first night, but we did not feel like moving after one night. Our room was $2136.00 for 7 nights, but did not include breakfast. I did ask nicely since we were staying so long if they could make an exception, and they did. I booked directly with the hotel. Breakfast was very nice with scrambled eggs, croissants, american style cereals, ham, yogurt, cheese, fruit salad(out of a can), coffee, and tea. There was never any deviation from the menu every day...always the same. Very quaint basement breakfast area. Nice lobby on the small side(mirrors make it look bigger) with small elevator. One beautiful Apple computer in the lobby for all guests to share. Be patient though. Often others were on it, and there were often access problems. I often had to use the french keyboard(one english, the other french) which takes getting used to, and they often had to sign me in with their manager's access code. All the staff were adequately friendly, but don't have grand ideas (after reading some of the gushing comments on this site). None of them would speak or look at me unless spoken to. Also, Leeloo, the dog, never showed up. Never took the public buses, but Ecoile Militaire metro stop is close. Unfortunately, that line won't take you anywhere you want, so you can't be afraid to switch to get to where you really want to go. The eiffel tower is an easy 15 minute walk. There are plenty of pleasant cafes nearby, and we loved the Thai restaurant literally next door to your right as you exit the hotel, and the cafe literally to your left(with a very friendly waiter). The Indian restaurant nearby is excellent too, but the waitstaff could be friendlier. ATM, self-service laundry, souvenir shops(open till midnight!), grocery stores and Rue Cler(sorry, highly over-rated) all nearby.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "cleveland,ohio", "Title": "\u201cDelightful, comfortable, clean, pleasant, and helpful hotel, with a view of the Eiffel Tower\u201d", "Author": "honeysucklerose-7", "ReviewID": "UR70209718", "Content": "I came to France with my niece, her two year old son, and a ten year old.

Duquesne eiffel is not part of a big, full-service, multinational hotel chain - it runs lean. You will have to fend for yourself for certain things like umbrellas and room service. that's ok, its Paris -- you should not be holed up in you room living off of the mini-bar anyway. Bring your own electrical adapters if your gadgets run at 120 volts. The neighborhood is a bit sleepy for my tastes but the proximity to the eiffel tower and h\u00f4tel invalid\u00e9s is a plus. It's desolate on Sundays so get up and get out lest you be searching endlessly for your caf\u00e9 au lait and pain du chocolat. The room was small, I suppose, but for Paris it was a great value.

They have some terrific sound proofing windows that open to the street if you want some fresh air. I do not like noise at night and this room was very quiet. The room is a decent size and I would characterize it as being cruise ship stateroom efficient. Not cramped, but no wasted space either. The W/C is in a separate little closet away from the sink and shower adding to efficiency. The bathroom was operating room-clean. Spotless upon arrival and it was maintained as such through out our stay. The staff, especially the women, could not have been nicer, friendlier or more helpful. The guys on the night shift were fine, but lacking in the enthusiasm the women had during the day. There is an iMac in the lobby to check your email and such. I did notice it does not clear the history or the cache automatically but that can be done manually when you are finished with your session. The hotel offered free wifi which was perfectly functional, although it did seem to time out quickly. I recognize that both points are picky.

First of all, the location on this gem cannot be beat. It is located within a 10-minute stroll from the Eiffel Tower, one block from the Invalides (\u201cNapoleon\u2019s Tomb\u201d and the Warfare Museum (a must for medieval armor and knights\u2019 gear that is not represented at the Louvre)) and two blocks from a Metro station Ecole Millitaire on the 8th line. Rue Cler, a cozy cobblestone pedestrian street with multitude of shops, cafes and food markets is also very close by. For the first two days we stayed in room #55, which I assume has the best view of the Eiffel Tower in the entire hotel and a real balcony (as opposed to Juliette balconies on other floors). The tower is right there in your window in its full glory. However, due to the size of the room & the location of the furniture it is impossible to see it from the bed, which cannot be moved to the side as the headboard is attached to the wall. However, some clever positioning will let you see it from a teeny tiny bathtub \u263a. For our last night, we were moved to room #44, which also had the view of the Eiffel Tower, but you had to look out of the window to see it. No big deal, as we were so exhausted from all the sightseeing that we used our room primarily for resting/sleeping purposes. Surprisingly, this room was much bigger than room 55 with a bigger bathtub and a separate toilet room, European style. Overall, the hotel is small and cozy, the lobby is pretty and the Reception Desk is attentive and extremely helpful with everything (they helped us a lot with those plug converters). The rooms themselves are small but very well decorated and clean. We had breakfast at the hotel once and for 24 Euros that we were charged, we could have totally gotten something better outside the hotel. The food was excellent and served in the beautiful basement dining room, which was probably one of the neatest hotel dining areas that I have ever seen, but the value was just not there if you are used to eating small breakfast. (Of course, if you like buffet style breakfast or breakfast is the meal of your day, you will enjoy it immensely). Now, some overall tips on the area and Paris in general. It was our first trip here and despite reading tons of reviews and guidebooks we still managed to have some hick-ups that were easily avoidable. First, we took everyone\u2019s advice on using Metro for all of our travel needs and boy this was good advice. The system is very easy to use and gets you everywhere within minutes. Transfers are easy and the longest we waited for a train was 5 minutes. However, we failed to take advantage of the unlimited pass deal. When we wanted to buy our first Metro ticket, we saw that there was an option to buy an unlimited 3-day pass, but when the clerk told us it was 40 Euros per person, we backed off and we should not have. This pass allows unlimited travel for 3 days on ALL public transportation, including metro, buses and RER trains (airport and Versailles trains). Considering that one ride on the train for 2 people is 3.20 Euros and 2 tickets to Versailles and the airport are 30Euros, we should have taken the unlimited deal. So, if you are a heavy sightseer, take the unlimited pass and you will save some Euros. Second, we found the food to be excellent. A lot of people on this website recommended Caf\u00e9 Du Marche on Rue Cler for meals and we did eat there twice but were not as impressed. It seemed a little on the cheaper side and on Sunday morning we found a bunch of drunk French men crowding the bar area and the waitress who served us breakfast had such dirty nails that I literally wanted to get up and leave. The food is also nothing to write home about. We tried the place across from Marche, Caf\u00e9 Central and found it way classier in d\u00e9cor, service and food quality. We also tried the Ulysses for crepes that one of the reviewers raved about and were disappointed to see them re-heat the crepes instead of making them from scratch. We generally followed Frommer\u2019s Guide to Paris (check it out for awesome walking tours of Marais, Montmartre and the Latin Quarter) and tried some of the restaurants that he recommended. But none of those restaurants came even close to the place right next to the Duquesne Hotel that was recommended to us by the Reception. The place is called 7eVino (still not sure what the heck it means) and it is located by the Ecole Millitaire Metro station (across the street from the big La Terraza restaurant). It is a small intimate restaurant (only 16 tables) with the most personable service that we have ever experienced. We come from NYC, the city of restaurants, but the owner of this place blew it out of the box for us. The food was amazing, just the right combination of traditional and modern French cuisine. Once we came in, the owner gave us complimentary glasses of wine and made sure we were 100% happy during the course of our meal. We tried escargots (Burgundy snails \u2013 6.5EU per 6 snails), oysters and I had beef in duck liver sauce (19EU), the taste of which I will never forget. The wine selection is amazing at this place and is very reasonably priced (average of 4EU per glass). The cr\u00e8me-brulee desert (7EU) was heavenly. We came back for dinner the next day and the owner, who by the way speaks fluent English, gave us one of the reserved tables and arranged a complimentary wine and cheese platter within seconds. We had another heavenly dining experience with a baked prawn and scallop appetizer and roasted duck and fish specials. Hands down, the best meal ever! It does take a while for your food to arrive so make sure you allocate a lot of time when you come to this place. But overall, this restaurant was one of the highlights of our Paris stay. Upon departure, the owner personally came to say goodbye to us and gave me a long-stemmed rose from a huge bouquet that was standing on the bar to commemorate Valentine\u2019s Day. Third, a Versailles trip is a must! We wanted to skip it first, but then reconsidered when we saw Napoleon III\u2019s apartments at the Louvre. The trip to the Chateau is painless and quick (1 Metro stop and then 30 minutes on a RER C train) and is totally worth it. One huge TIP: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE TICKETS BEFORE YOU ARRIVE TO THE CHATEAU (you can buy them online before you depart to Paris). When we got off the train in Versailles, there was a tour guide advising people to buy the tickets at the tour agency right across the street from the station, but we totally disregarded the advice, thinking that the line cannot be that bad in February. And of course, we were completely wrong. We stood in line for at least an hour and in the end, we bought tickets at the ticket machine (credit cards only) located in the lobby of the ticket office. The machine had absolutely no line and if we knew about it, we would not have wasted an hour on that ridiculous queue. So if you do arrive without tickets, check the lobby first to see if the machines are working (3 out of 4 of them were broken) to save yourself some time. After snapping some beautiful pictures of the Opera House, we visited the Galleries Lafayette, Paris\u2019s biggest and most famous shopping mall and it was an interesting experience to see European fashion (and prices!) at its best. The main hall of the mall is incredibly beautiful. I mainly did window-shopping as the prices are insane but I am pretty sure some reasonably-price shopping can be done on the street where the mall is located as I saw European H&M, GAP, Benetton & Zara there. We decided not to use the airport shuttle on the way back and took the Metro to the airport. The trip was a little complicated as there were a bunch of stairs to climb during transfers, but we got to CDG in about an hour after leaving the hotel. The cost for 2 people was 17EU but it could have been avoided if you had the unlimited Paris pass. (We got on at the Ecole Millitaire station and took Line 8 to Invalides station and then took Line 1 to Chatelet where we transferred to the B train to CDG). Overall, we had an amazing trip. In general, I would advise to avoid the Metro after 9pm as it seemed to be full of sketchy people and use the \u201cbig city radar\u201d when visiting the major tourist cites that are swarming with the \u201csouvenir sellers\u201d with dubious intentions.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cA terrific stay...\u201d", "Author": "collee09", "ReviewID": "UR55676747", "Content": "I really can't say enough great things about this hotel.

Relatively easy access to Metro, plenty of cafes and restaurants, a Carrefour grocery store just a couple blocks away that came in quite handy. (And of course, handy to the Tower.)

I have requested a bottle of Champagne and there it was in the room upon our arrival, in a bucket of Ice with 2 Champagne glasses. Jennifer was kind enough and the most helpful when we asked about some information on what to do while in Paris, explaining every sightsee possible in such short time, available places to eat nearby and also all the transportation to get everywhere. Rue Cler is just maybe 7min walk down the road towards the center, and there you can find lots of places with fresh baguettes or other french specialities and shop fresh for vegetables, fruits, etc. The nearest metro station would be Ecole Militaire and is about 5min walk. Eiffel tower is just there, as soon as you reach ecole militaire, 3min walk, you will be in front of champ de mars and Eiffel Tower in the other end. On the back of the Hotel is Les Invalides, 3min walk and further 10min will be the Seine River and the Louvre very close, in fact, after the Louvre we still walked to Notre Dame. No subways needed at all (is a waste of time going underground in such a city as Paris, where every corner counts). Perfect Location i would say, and nowhere else beats the view from this hotel, not close or far from Eiffel Tower, just perfect. Absolutely gorgeous breakfast in the basement. The most kind and helpful staff. This place is spotless, so clean and neat that is nowadays hard to find on a 3 star. And you have free internet access in the hotel lobby.

To our delight, they all spoke english and never tired of our many questions regarding metro's, buses, show tickets and directions to museums and other sites. I will also comment that even before we arrived to the hotel, my emails with questions were answered quickly and completely. Special thanks to Oliver, Helene, Jennifer, Jessica, Alain and Patrick for making us feel so welcomed during our entire stay. There is a shuttle service that the hotel can arrange for a pickup from the airport...very reasonable at 36 Euros for 2 persons--this shuttle service can also pickup at the HDE for a return to the airport. The room was cozy and clean. It did not matter the small size of the room since we could lay in bed and look to the Eiffel Tower---a priceless experience while in Paris!!

BTW the metro is so cheap to get around on that you be mad if you didn't use it! fantastic and easy system to use.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sayville, NY", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, wonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "TheMells", "ReviewID": "UR50068190", "Content": "We booked this hotel after consulting TripAdvisor and we were very happy with the decision.

Initially, we were told there were none available, but if anything changed, they would attempt to accommodate us. True to their word, we were given a room offering spectacular views of the Tower when we arrived. Although the room faced the main boulevard, the nearly floor-to-ceiling casement windows were completely soundproof when closed.

We were advised by friends that the nearby \"Rue Cler\" was a great little street with lots of shops, boulangeries, fromageries, cafes, etc. This was one of the high points of staying at Duquesne Eiffel. We spent so much time just walking around this area, and enjoyed every minute. Their are some fantastic resturants and cafes in the area... we tried many of them and liked them all. The Eiffel Tower is about a 10 or 15min walk from the hotel. Also, close to a metro station, or easy to catch a taxi right outside. Another high point: we had booked a standard room, but were upgraded for free to a room with a balcony and view of the Eiffel Tower. We did not ask for the upgrade, it was just offered to us when we checked in :) Our room was very nicely decorated, tiny, but beautiful. Even the soap in the shower was divine (rosemary, something or other). We reccommend spending the extra money for a room with a balcony and view - as we found this to be our favorite thing about the room. Their \"petit dejeuner\" was expensive (well so is everything in Paris), but worth it. Delicious, convenient, and the breakfast room itself is lovely. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Each time we passed the front desk we were greeted, and when we asked any questions they did their best to answer thoroughly. Whether we left our room early in the morning or late in the afternoon, we always returned to fresh towels, clean sheets etc. Housekeeping is very flexible as to when they clean your room.

Everything was small by American standards but more than adequate for my wife. We may have had a 3 star hotel but thankfully the bathroom was a 5 star bathroom. Much more spacious than I imagined it could ever be and with a granite top on the sink and a real shower. The linens, carpet and towels were all in perfect condition as if they were very new. We could find nothing to complain about other than the size of the room. That really did not matter as we were so tired when we returned we didn't exactly want to do any more walking than was necessary. Plus it was all part of the Paris experience. Small room, narrow halls and a tiny elevator. All quaint. From our first floor hotel room (second if you count the American way) we could look out and see the Eiffel tower. I did it once and never looked again, so don't bother looking for a hotel with a view. When we left the hotel and came home we could look at the Eiffel Tower all the way to and from the Metro station. The location was perfect. Two blocks to the Metro station and some of the best restaurants in the area. For breakfast go to the Pettte Brasserie PTT at the bottom of the Rue Cler. Coffee was good and with Rick Steves' book you get an Amercan breakfast with an egg and ham for 6 E. For a cheap dinner go the Tribecca on Rue Cler. Great food and service but 4 days in a row was a little t0o much for us. For excellent but slightly more expensive food try Le Florimond on Avenue de La Motte Picquet which is located at the end of Rue Cler. It is not open on Saturday and Sunday and doesn't open their doors at night until 7:00 PM. Stop by the night before and make reserations. Also go to the Restaurant Pasco which is farther down de La Motte Picquet. Walk doiwn past La Florimond and when you get to the corner turn right and you will see it 50 feet down the next street on the right. Both of these last two were very good restaurants and worth every penny. For a big time expensive meal go to La Fontaine de Mars and see why Obama ate there. Don;t eat dessert at any of the restaraunts. Stop off on the way back from sightseeing and buy desserts at the Lenore which is located between the Metro station and the Post Office on De La Motte Picquet. The cheesecake was light and tasty. The chocolate candies were terrific but I couldn't see buying a box of chocolate and a dessert. If you need to convert American dollars go to the Post Office. Best conversion rate in town. If you stay here say hello to Jennifer and Jessica. They worked the front desk many of the days we were there and tipped us off to much of what I have listed here. There is computer available in the lobby so you can check your email. They also had a limited number and types of power converters you could borrow.

After arriving at Gare Du Nord via Eurostar, the transportation company I had arranged was waiting for us after getting off the train. I would highly recommend a transportion service, particularly with a family of four. Two cabs would be needed, and the taxi cues at the Gare Du Nord are famously long after a train arrives. It was 60 euro for a minivan to take us all and luggage through Easy Transfer Service of Paris. They were always on time, and made our transfers effortless. It was a quick 10-15 minute ride to Duquesne Eiffel. The check in at the hotel was quick and easy, and all of the front desk staff were friendly and able to answer any questions on how to get to places from there. They provided maps with the directions, and all spoke fluent English. The elevator is small, and will only accomodate four people, so people and luggage took us two trips, but we were aware of this before we booked. We found small elevators to be the norm in Europe at the smaller hotels. This is similar to the transportation problem: A taxi would only handle two people and luggage, like the elevator. Our biggest concern on this trip was finding hotels with air conditioning. As we progessed from London to Paris to Rome, finding hotels with air conditioning became an increasing challenge. This hotel had great air conditioning. The hotel is located two blocks from the Ecole Militare metro station for easy access to the subway system. There are bank ATM's, small grocery store, and a famous local French pastry shop and bistro's within the two block trip to the metro station. The rooms are smaller than usual, and we were prepared for that. We read a review of someone who left immediately because of the small rooms. The hotel is a 17th century building, hence the room size, but for lack of size, the rooms were completly updated recently with modern features, and very clean. The room our kids had was a bit bigger than ours with two twin size beds. As before, the important feature for us was that the air conditioning was great. The bathrooms are small as well , but very well appointed for their size. We do not spend a lot of time in the room anyway, so being for lack of room was not a problem for us. The free wifi had to be obtained in the lobby, as they were in the middle of gaining a new contract service for wifi when we were there. There is a small bar in the lobby as well with drinks that are not overpriced. The rooms have a keyed safe, obtaining the key on request from the front desk, as well as a minibar that is not terribly overpriced as they are in the US. But, as I mentioned, there is a small store a block away where drinks and snacks, etc. can be bought. The service of the room was outstanding; never intrusive, and immaculate on return from a day out. The continental breakfast is served in the basement in what could have been an old wine cellar. There was French bacon, like Canadian bacon, scrambled eggs, as well as cerals, toast, coffee, juice, etc. The service personnel where all very friendly and helpful. I couldn't help but leave a few euros for a tip, although it is not expected. The hotel is a couple of blocks from the Ecole Militare, at the end of the Champs Du Mars, making about a fifteen minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. The front desk personnel warned us to hang on tightly to our cameras around the Eiffel Tower from snatch and grab theives. We did make it to the top of the Eiffel Tower in the early evening, and it was well worth the 45 minute wait to start our way up. The view at night was incredible. Among other sights we visited in the four days we were in Paris: The Louvre was an all day affair to see a third of it as we well knew. It worked out well that day since it rained. Notre Dame, as well as an organ recital there one night. A day trip to Versaille with Fat Tire Bike Tours; I wrote a review of the wonderful trip we had. Montmartre for the girls to go shopping. We even made it to P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery to visit the grave of Jim Morrison. We liked this hotel, although I would not recommend it for people not used to some of the smaller features of European hotels. Anything with the expected space of American chains will cost twice as much in a central location such as this.

If you use streetview for the US, you will be amazed at how much better the Paris version is. E.g., you can zoom in 4 times and read 2 inch font on storefronts - the photos seem to be equal to 2-3 megapixel cameras versus the just 1 megapixel version in the US. We used this feature to find HSBC ATMs in the neighborhood. (see pic of La Terrasse restaraunt attached) -Shower Interesting swing out door that seems to invite water to leap onto the floor took some gettign used to. However, by the second try I had mastered the relatively dry shower technique and did not flood the place. See the pics - the door swings out and covers only half the tub surface, so water splash goes everywhere if you are showering. If you are tubbing, be aware that this a half tub and unless you are 3 ft tall, won't be able to stretch out. Not t a biggie for me as I prefer showers. -Window Came with a nice sidestreet view (see pic) and was really dead silent when closed. Really - there was construction down the street with jackhammers that were rendered silent - not quiet, but dead silent when I closed the window. And, we heard no other guest room noise. -A/C Is not US spec A/C. So, it does not get extremely cold. It keeps the room reasonably cool, about 75F, but not cold. Several nights dipped to the low 60s and I simply opened the window because the street noise was not that bad. There is a dial on the wall, but ignore it, becuase we kep it at \"full blast\" for the entire week we were there and the temps never went below 75F. Again, not a huge deal, but there is no really cold breeze, it comes from the ceiling at a drip and a slow drip at that. That said, it was not enough of a problem to complain about, even on a 95F day. -Location Within about 7 minutes walking to the Eiffel tower and 5 minutes to Champs de Mars, the perfect picnic location. Nice, safe, quiet neighborhood. We felt fine coming home late at night. -Staff Perfect and helpful. Enough said. -Tip There is a shoe buffer-type machine in the lobby to clean you shoes after you have been off galavanting in the tan powdery dirt of Paris - which is everywhere - use it. The carpets are dark and show the foot prints if you do not. -Lobby internet Stop at the fron desk to get a free login password and check your email. The speed, according to speedtest.net was fairly low (0.96mbps down and 0.23mbps up), but perfectly suited for checking the weather and email. Great public-use Apple in the lobby if you don't have a laptop. -Breakfast We didn't eat at the hotel becuase there were so many cafes within easy walking distance. For an excellent continental breakfast that will carry you for hours of walking, try La Terrasse de 7eme, mentioned in Rick Steve's Paris 2009 book. It is on the corner of Avenue Bosquet and Avenue De La Motte Picquet, within sight of the hotel. For 12 euros, you get a few slices of ham, 2 eggs, caf\u00e9 creme (incredible coffee with cream), two slices of white toast to dab the eggs, a 10-inch buttered half baguette, two jellies, sugar cubes, and a huge croissant. As a 6ft, 200 pound American, I was more than satisfied with the quantity and quality, and at 12 euros, a steal for the food and experience. Try sitting just inside the restaraunt on one of the window border seats. You get a nice cushy fabric chair while still being able to see the outside crowds pass by. -Food The hotel is very near Rue Cler (again see google street view) and there are several very good and reasonable eateries there - including Cafe du Marche and Tribeca Italian Rest., two small CVS type stores for emergency food supplies, etc. (we bought three 6-pack real 100% orange juice boxes for only 1.50 euros each), There's also a nice English-speaking creperie - \"Ulyesses\" in the middle of Rue Cler.", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood location for short weekend\u201d", "Author": "Markus26", "ReviewID": "UR39075022", "Content": "The hotel is conveiently located for a short weekend in Paris close to Invalides,Eiffel and the metro.

Reservation online was fast and easy on their official website - old website layout but I understood from the girls at frontdesk that they will have a new website very soon. Rate was same as on Booking/Venere... and rate was in line with competitor hotels nearby. Check-in's been fast and easy. Efficient girls at reception. Unfortunately I put my room card key by my blackberry case (the one with a magnet inside, which means my card key did not work. When I went down to reception to get it activated again, it took a few seconds and staff was willing to help. The room had a great view to the Eiffel tower. Room size was quite good for a 3* property in Paris. Separate toilets. Bathroom was small but I'd rather have extra square meters in room itself than in the bathroom. Very good bed. Flat TV with lots of channels. minibar with reasonable rates: a Perrier was 2.60 Euros. Usually I pay 3 to 4 Euros for a Perrier in hotel minibars. I checked details such as hangers, bathroom line, guest supplies... and everything was cleaned and where it was expected to be. When hangers are different and bad ones, it reflects a good idea of how the hotel is maintained and managed. At the Duquesne Eiffel, their maids know their job. Air conditioing worked well and did not smell. Carpet was cleaned. I did not use their free high speed Internet access since I'm using a 3G card everywhere I go in France. So many hotels have been late providing such a basic service as HSIA that travellers like me have a 3G card in laptop. However, while waisting time waiting for a friend in hotel lobby I checked available wireless networks and found theirs.In hotel lobby they provide free use of a Mac computer with very large screen and 2 keyboard - 1 french and 1 English, next to the bar. Breakfast room is lovely. There was everything needed, including eggs, ham, cheese. Unsual in a 40 room parisian hotel. Breakfast room is small but staff seems to be efficient and refresh tables fast. Coffee was good breakfast coffee - it is funny saying that but I experienced so many terrible coffees elsewhere... Checkout's been fast and easy. \"Have you had something from the minibar\", a few clicks on their computer and I got a printed bill that was right. They called a taxi for me. I have stayed many times on left bank but can't remember having stayed in 7th district. This is very quiet, very accessible - metro is one block away. It looks easy to park outside.

We stayed at the Hotel Duquesne for the duration of our holiday, and chose it after reading so many positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We\u2019re so happy we did...we absolutely loved it! The location is perfect: in a quiet neighbourhood near the Eiffel Tower, Hotel Invalides & Napolean\u2019s Tomb, the Rodin museum, and the Rue Cler area. If you like to walk (and you can do plenty of it in Paris!), it\u2019s within walking distance of the Louvre and Tuileries Gardens, Place de la Concorde, the Orangerie and Orsay museums, Grand and Petit Palais, and Pont de l\u2019Alma (site of Princess Di\u2019s accident). But the Ecole Militaire metro stop is also close by and the system is so easy to use, you can get anywhere in Paris in very little time. The hotel itself is charming; the outside fa\u00e7ade is quaint with little tables set out front \u2013 perfect for enjoying a quiet drink outside. The lobby, reception and bar area is well kept, and the provided laptop and free lobby WiFi access is a nice bonus. The staff, both day and night staff, are efficient, pleasant and courteous, and their English is far better than my limited French. Julie, Jennifer and Marieaux (sp?) were very helpful both during email exchanges before the trip, and to all of our inquiries during our stay. The elevator is definitely the smallest I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019d read about it, but was still surprised to see it when we arrived. You can fit 4 people who don\u2019t mind getting close, or one person and two suitcases. Since we had three cases, we each went up separately, but this was no inconvenience at all. I had reserved our room well in advance and specifically requested room # 55 (Gustave Eiffel), based on the recommendation of Trip Advisor contributors. It was an absolutely lovely room. While small in comparison to North American standards, it was perfect for Paris, where you\u2019re not expected to spend much time in your room. And truthfully, the size contributed to the Parisien feel for us. The d\u00e9cor was contemporary, and the wardrobe, dresser, desk and night stand drawers provided adequate storage for our needs. The bathroom was very clean and it was such a thrill to be able to lounge in a bubble bath and gaze out at the Eiffel Tower through the balcony window! Which brings me to the best part of this hotel...the view. We expressly wanted a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower \u2013 and you can\u2019t get a better view for your money than Hotel Duquesne! I never did get over the thrill of opening the balcony doors and looking straight at the Tower...it was a highlight of the trip for me! Our room had a wrap-around balcony and provided some great views of the city. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and plan on staying here again on our next trip to Paris. The only constructive criticism I would have is with regards to attention to details. When I made our reservation, I explained that we were going to be in Paris to celebrate our 10th anniversary, and I indicated which day that would be. Typically, a hotel will make note of special occasions and then acknowledge it in some way during a guest\u2019s stay\u2014this did not happen. Further, a day previous, I asked Jennifer to make a dinner reservation for our anniversary at Le Florimond (a very nice restaurant we\u2019d read about in Rick Steve\u2019s Paris 2009 book). She graciously did, but didn\u2019t mention to them that we were there for our anniversary.

While the fireworks were a bit disappointing (because of the heavy fog, we figured) this hotel was certainly not! We made our reservations through their official website, and we didn't have any problems with it at all. I exchanged a few e-mails with Julie Palisse, who replies to the reviews here, and she was extremely helpful with answering any questions I had. We also ordered their airport transfer service, which was quite efficient and convenient; the annoying part, however, was having to wait for the car outside the airport gate in the cold for much longer than we had been told. Our first impression upon entering the hotel was a very good one: the interior was clean, cozy, and the staff at the reception was not only quite friendly, but also spoke very good English. We stayed in room 18, a standard double room that had no view, but was very nicely decorated. It was, of course, small, but that should always be expected in Paris. Everything was spotless clean, and the bed was absolutely fantastic (something very important after a long day of walking and sightseeing). Unavoidably, the bathroom was indeed small, but since it was just as well-taken-care-of as the rest of the room, that was not a problem. Something worth mentioning is that we never really figured out how to make the air conditioning work as we wanted it to. So I guess we were lucky that even though the room was always very hot when we returned from a day out, the problem could be easily and quickly solved by leaving the windows open for a few minutes. Admittedly though, we could have just called the reception. One of the reasons why we picked the Duquesne in the first place was its location, and it was on a par with our expectations in that aspect as well. The Eiffel Tower was within walking distance, and so were a few subway stations (which is really all you'll ever need to get around in Paris). Although the street the hotel was actually in didn't have many services or amenities, it was relatively quiet, which was a bonus at night. Besides, there were many other streets nearby that more than made up for it, with their many boulangeries, brasseries and shops in general. Rue Cler is particularly worth mentioning, offering many options of places to eat, have a drink or even just buy some fresh bread, cheese and good wine for a simpler, economic but still delicious meal in the hotel room. We usually ate breakfast around that area too, since the menus offered were quite filling and still cheaper than the hotel breakfast, but we did choose to indulge and ask for room service on the morning of January 1st. With a generous assortment of breads, jams, juice and coffee, plus the added convenience of having a breakfast for two in bed, we think the meal was fairly priced. Finding affordable places to have dinner in the direct area of the hotel wasn't easy, but upon asking at the reception for a suggestion, we were told about Le 7\u00e8me Vin: while it wouldn't be accurate to say it was an inexpensive place, it was definitely the most charming, and the best meal we had during our stay. We believe the hotel staff definitely contributed to make our trip even better: the service was excellent, from the receptionists to the housekeeping ladies. Coming back from a tiring day to find our room as cozy and clean as it was on the first day we arrived was always a very pleasant part of our routine in Paris. We were even surprised by a box of chocolate-coated nuts waiting for us in the room after New Year's, so we were glad to be able to show our appreciation with a few small gifts to the staff as well. Just writing this review and remembering the many good memories from the trip has really reminded us of how much want to come back. My boyfriend is from the Netherlands and it was his first time in Paris, hopefully out of many more to come.

We could just about see it around the corner of an adjacent building. And to be honest there is very little else on this side of the river. The room was very very small, and the decor was old - infact some of the wallpaper was peeling and badly marked. The toilet was half the size of the room - which was frustrating as it was a waste of precious space. The breakfast was expensive and average at best.

After a lot of searching on the internet after a good, well-positioned and price-acceptable hotel, I have come across Hotel Duquesne Eiffel. The location seemed perfect for us with two subway stations close by. The Eiffel tower is close to the hotel so this tall tower can be used as an orientation point when walking from or to the hotel. Reviews on Tripadvisor and the hotel\u2019s pictures looked great. Luckily I have found an offer on www.hotel.de which included a double room with breakfast buffet and welcome drink (100 euros per night for the whole, min. stay 2 nights) so I have booked it immediately. This offer wasn\u2019t available on the hotel\u2019s website. If you are booking a hotel in advance (2-3 months before the trip) or taking a trip in the next days, you can find various good-value offers (e.g. early bird offers, last minute offers) so search through more websites (HRS.de, hotel.de, FastBooking.com, Expedia.de) before booking the hotel. The feature of \u201cCheck rates\u201d on the tripadvisor is very helpful to see the price differences on most of the hotel booking websites, these price differences can be quite high on certain occasions. Upon arrival and during our stay of 4 nights, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. In the lobby, you can find a laptop with internet connection for free use. Our room was on the 4th floor with a view to the Eiffel tower. I was admiring it every morning when waking up and every evening before going to sleep. I had a W-Lan connection in our room, but, due to some miss-configuration, the internet didn\u2019t work unfortunately. It is well-known that hotel rooms is Paris are small so don\u2019t be surprised. Our room was tasteful and nicely furnished, its size was comfortably enough for two people. The bathroom was modernly equipped. The location of the hotel is even better than I thought when booking this hotel. Visiting Paris by foot is the best way to get a real taste of the city so we took nice walks to most of the sights starting from the hotel in the morning. The neighborhood seemed safe; we, two women, walked back to the hotel every evening without any fear, only by following the Eiffel tower from a distance. A good idea is to plan your daily itinerary upfront in order visit every day the sights close by in one chose area by foot if possible. We used the subway only for coming from and going to the airport. We had lovely chats with the hotel\u2019s owner who stayed at the reception every evening and appreciated all the tips about Paris which he gave us. The breakfast buffet was delicious and more than sufficient to charge our energy for the upcoming long day. Various choices are available: ham and cheese, omlette and bacon, 4-5 different fruit jams, 4 types of cereals, orange and grapefruit juice, milk, coffee, tee and last but not least the typical French bakery products: croissant, pain au chocolat, pain au raisins and baguette. You can request to have your breakfast delivered in your room. We have chosen to serve it in the charming and tasteful breakfast room.

A pint of Lager cost 10 euros and we struggled to get a snack under 10 euros also. A cup of tea was 5.50 euro. It ruined our weekend slightly as the euro is so close to the pound. We tried to eat and drink slighly out of the main streets but the prices were just as bad. I will say though how efficient their train services are, the metro was every couple of minutes but as you'd expect everything was in french and the train announcer only announcd the stops in french so you need to keep your wits about you.

The bed was huge and the room and bathroom were very clean. The staff were very helpful when we had queries about the area and when we checked out they looked after our luggage. The only disappointment was the breakfast which we paid 12 euros each for. Admittedly we didn't get up until 9.30am but they did say it was until 10.30am. On offer was only cold scrambled egg and bacon with some french bread and a few pastries. There were some cereals but they didn't look too appealing.

The facilities inside the room were good including a mini-bar service, flat screen T.V. and modern/new shower unit. The only things worthy of critical comment are pretty minimal, however so that others are aware: if you stay in rooms at the end of a corridor you need to know where the light switch is, to illuminate the area in front of your door, otherwise it can be quite difficult to see the handle and unlock the door. Once you've found the light ouside the door for the first time it's no problem from then on. There are some areas with suspended panels for the celing and when you open/close a door the pressure can sometimes cause these to move and they can startle you a little. Finally, like many older buildings you can hear most every noise in the rooms around you. This is just the way things are in older built apartments & hotels and simply cannot be avoided.

The motion sensitive lights in the hallways on our floor did not always work. Also, staff did not tell us on how to turn on the lights in our room.

If you do not speak French you will go bonkers if you have to spend any long spells relaxing in your room. Very strange considering one would assume this property would attract many international visitors and to not even have a basic news channel to watch is frustrating (let alone Hollywood movies badly overdubbed). Minor issues aside, we would recommend the Duquesne for first time visitors to Paris, it's in a good neighbourhood with decent accessibility to everywhere. If returning we would probably stay elsewhere but that's taking nothing away from this very nice hotel.

We got checked in right away and were given the room I had requested some 9 months before when I booked - one with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. We were in the Eiffel Tower Room (appropriately named!) on the 4th floor, and, let me tell you, it was wonderful to have our first good look at the tower come from the hotel room! We would spend some very romantic moments gazing at the sparkling tower at night from our window. Being in a big European city, the room was small, of course, but quite comfortable. Everything was super clean, and I'm very observant about that sort of thing when it comes to hotels. There was the queen bed, a dresser-ish piece of furniture with a mini fridge in it, a desk with a chair, a flat screen TV, a small closet, the bathroom with sink and shower/tub, and a separate toilet closet. One thing I found very nice is how sound-insulated the windows were. When open, you heard the usual city noise, but when closed, it was extremely quiet. We didn't partake of the 11 euro breakfast, so I can't comment on that. Instead, we went around the corner to the nearby Rue Cler where there are fruit stands and bakeries to put together a nice breakfast from. Our first morning there, we bought some croissants, beignets (more dense than New Orleans beignets), nectarines, orange juice, and goat cheese (the cheese was all for hubby, bleh) and walked down to the Eiffel Tower where we found a nice park bench on which to enjoy our meal. A much preferable experience to breakfasting in a hotel, IMO.

We stayed at a budget hotel in the Latin Quarter the last time we visited and were disappointed so this time I was looking for something affordable but nice and found it at this hotel.

They had a computer set up in the lobby where we checked our email which was very nice for us. Breakfast was not included in our rate of \u20ac102, it was an additional \u20ac11 so we got breakfast at a local patisserie instead since we just want a pastry. We had a standard double room, there are also comfort rooms and superior rooms, some of which appear to have a view of the Eiffel Tower and balconies. We booked the room on booking.com, the rate was lower than their normal rate I assume because it was August when a lot of people avoid going to Paris since a lot of Parisians vacation at that time.

We could not have picked a nicer hotel. The hotel is located very near the Metro stop Ecole Militaire about 3 blocks away and once you get the gist of the subway it is a great way to get around. You can buy a \"Visite Pass\" which gives you unlimited use of the trains and buses for a certain number of days. We bought a 3 day Visite and when that was done we got a carnet of tickets ( a 10 pack of tickets ) and used that.Our hotel was in the 7th arrondismont literally a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. Our room overooked the street and we could just catch a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower when it was lit up at night. The hotel sits on a corner and it is very convienent to many sites that are very nearby. Les Invalides , where Napolean is buried is right down the street, the Eiffel Tower is very close by, The Rodin Musum is around the corner from Les Invalides that is where the famous statue of The Thinker is . It is a magnificient statue and it sits outside in the middle of a rose garden- fabulous!! The mostly pedestrian only street called The Rue Cler is one block behind the Ecole Mitaire Metro stop. We really enjoyed Rue Cler , it is a slice of life for the local Parisien. There is a boulangerie called The Artisan where you get the best croisannts ,baguettes and pastries. We ate breakfast at Le Pettitte Bistro next to the Post office , and dinner at a restaurant down further called Tribeca both were excellent. If you are a Rick Steves fan he recommends them both. We also ate at la Terasse on the corner by the Metro stop Ecole Militaire, also very good food .The hotel has recently been remodeled and our room # 47 was beautiful. The windows are brand new and double glazed so there was no street noise at all, we were on the 4th floor just above the trees.The size is small but that is standard for Europe. It was very clean and everything was brand new ( linens - towels etc ) The closet is the only place to put your clothes, there are shelves and hangars. It was adequate for our stay of 5 days. The hotel staff were very nice especially Lucy who was a huge help with everything. All the staff spoke perfect english so there was no problem. It was so nice to meet Julie, the manager whom we've read so much about on Trip Advisor, she was very sweet and she should be proud of her staff. We had use of the hotels laptop computer and we were able to check our email and keep in touch with family back home. The hotel lobby was the last thing being remodeled and it was finished on the day we left, the floors looked great! We used the hop on/hop off Batobus boat tours as our transportation and also walked a lot! You can get the Batobus boat at the base of the Eiffel Tower and it literally stops at every major museum or place of interest. It was a nice and calm way to travel ,but it is not for those in a hurry. I loved it and found it to be reasonably priced.It will take you to The Lovre, Notre Dame, Champs d' Elysee, Orsay Museum etc.. most of the major museums are along the river Seine. We took the Metro up to Sacre Couer Church in Montmartre ( get off at Anvers and take the funicular up to the top, it costs one metro ticket approx 1.60 Euro for the funicular) the view from the steps of Sacre Couer down into the city of Paris are amazing. We looked around where the artists set up shop on Place du Terre right around the corner from Sacre Couer. My daughter had her portrait drawn for 35 Euros ( a little less than $ 50 US ) it was well worth it, it was an amazing experience, one I'm sure she'll never forget.

Of course the rooms are small, the hotel was built 200 years ago, but the rooms are extremely modern and comfortable. Electronic door locks, flatscreen TV, very well appointed bathroom amenities, modern furniture and a good number of power outlets (not in the bathroom however, which seemed to be common in the other hotels we stayed in Europe). And quiet! The windows/doors were double glazed, and the room was really quiet. It was surprising to open the doors to go out to the balcony and realise how noisy it was outside. The staff were very helpful and had no issues with regards speaking in English (though I tried attempting French). Lucie really helped us get settled on the first day, she also helped me arrange flowers for the room for our Anniversary to surprise my wife, she helped explain the Metro and navigating around, and they were able to arrange a Yellow Van for us to get us to the airport when we checked out.

We would definitely stay there again and they really helped make our visit to Paris a special event.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSafe, clean, affordable, well located, welcoming and stylish\u201d", "Author": "L878765", "ReviewID": "UR17883745", "Content": "Wow - where to start? It is an excellent hotel, and the best value hotel I have used in Paris. I've been visiting Paris for 20 years and this is the best hotel (but not the most expensie) I've stayed in. Excellent location in a pleasant, quiet but very central area. Close to metro, but you can walk to many places in central Paris from the hotel. You can also stock up on mineral water, fruit, bread etc in shops nearby. The hotel is very stylish, in fact I'd say it is sophisticated - I got the impression that someone with an interior design background has been involved in this or they've paid a lot to get a good professional designer in. The room I stayed in was very nicely decorated and furnished - in fact better than most 4 star hotels I have stayed in. Everything was perfect, including the choice of paint colour on the woodwork and the inspired striped carpet! The lighting was unusually good - with all the lights on it was bright enough for me to read by, I'm really sick of dismal rooms when you turn the lights on full and you still can't read. Reception staff spoke fluent English, were efficient, friendly, and more approachable and helpful than I have found before in a Paris hotel. The breakfast serving staff were great also - good English, friendly, helpful. I'm not one for asking a lot of questions of reception staff, but I noticed some other English speaking guests doing so and the receptionist was really helping with advice, hints etc. Both check-in and check-out were rapid. The reason I booked here and not another place? Fire safety. I have a thing about it, and, being English, despair of why such an advanced country as France doesn't have the same standards we insist on in hotels in the UK. I only book Paris hotels if there are smoke detectors, which rules a lot of them out! And there are mains-wired detectors, and alarms, in the public areas - so I felt safe. But there didn't seem to be a smoke detector or alarm in my room. I was disappointed about this - I had read on some website (maybe not the hotel one, but one of the many that carry details about hotels) that there were smoke detectors or alarms in each room. If there was a detector or alarm in my room I could not find it. However, I would stay again - it's well built, and as well as the public areas coverage there was a sturdy fire door to segregate the bit of corridor my room was in from the rest of the corridor, and so I felt entirely safe. (PS I wish reviewers on tripadvisor would comment on this feature - a couple of years ago I stayed in a very positively reviewed Paris Hotel that I thought was a death-trap, with no smoke detectors or alarms - and yet there were dozens of people who'd written how nice the receptionists were! Hotels like this one, that invest in safety, should be acknowledged for this). Good quality flat screen tv with reasonable range of channels. A great view of the Eiffel Tower, shimmering and glittering. On a reasonably busy road but not too bad, and the double (or is it triple?) glazing highly effective. Good plumbing, in fact very good - easy to get the temperature balance right, and a proper shower screen (which you don't always get in Paris). I stay in hotels quite a lot, and this one was unusually clean. There is not even a hint of limescale build-up anywhere in the bathroom, and no dust. You get the impression that someone obsessive about quality is involved in running this hotel. Attention to detail is everywhere. I didn't use it, but there was a laptop with internet access and checking it briefly it seemed to be working okay. Oh, and whilst it's a newspaper I abhor and never buy because it attacks my home city (Liverpool), the English newspaper The Guardian was stocked. Nice for those English liberals, public servants and Liverpool-haters out there. Bed comfortable - I prefer a firm mattress and found it ok, not as hard as I like at home, but a good hard hotel firm. If I stay somewehre with a soft mattress I usualy end up sleeping on the floor, but no such problem here. I slept very well. Noise between rooms was a bit of a mystery to me so hard to judge after just one stay of just one night. Generally I think it's very good indeed - for an old building excellent. However, the doors close noisily and someone staying in a room close to me came back late and seemed to open and close the door a lot......the hall lights (movement activated?) may have confused them, I don't know. It woke me up. But no noise of neighbouring bathrooms (which is common in old converstions) or of TVs, which makes me think the sound insulation is good. I think if you are noise-phobic (as I am, as well as being fire-phobic and rudeness-phobic) you will probably get on well with this hotel. What can be improved? The quality of breakfast was acceptable but a bit disappointing for the price (12 euro) despite the lovely staff. Coffee in particular was a let-down - murky and just quite not good enough. I mainly stay in English hotels, where the quality of coffee has come on hugely in recent years, and sadly Paris hotels (this one is not alone) aren't quite there with coffee at the moment. Choice of food very limited. Just not quite good enough for the money. Okay, don't be put off, it's not a deal-breaker, but I think it could be improved. Served in a lovely stone room. The minibar prices are not at all good! 2.50 for a packet of crisps!!!!!!!!!! (chips to Americans). I know all hotels charge a lot for minibars, but with the pound-exchange rate being so bad, it just hurt as I arrived hungry and raided the mini-bar! Lots of little shops nearby, so don't make my mistake! So there are two things that I think might be improved, but obviously everything comes at a price, and the price for the room was excellent, so I won't complain too loudly. At last I have found a hotel in Paris I really like, and feel comfortable and safe in that doesn't cost a fortune! Whoever is repsonsible for all this, well done and thank you.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cGreat with a 4 year old!\u201d", "Author": "lvsCleveland", "ReviewID": "UR17735157", "Content": "We loved being so close to the Eiffel Tower.

Having been to Paris three times previously, I have decided that nowhere could be better than the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel in the 7th Arr. (neighborhood area). I read a lot of reviews on Trip Advisor and decided this time on the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel--and I didn't go wrong! It is a charming hotel located across from the Ecole Militaire and about a block from Les Invalides in a beautiful area of boulevards, trees, and lovely cafes. Cross the boulevard, and walk directly to the Champs du Mars, the gorgeous park in which sits the Eiffel Tower! Just two blocks from the hotel is the Rue Cler market street (think chocolate, wine, flowers). Julie, the hotel's manager is a dream to work with. She helped me make the reservation directly with the hotel (and didn't get frustrated at all when my travel dates had to change). All of the staff are fluent in English and were most helpful in making reservations, taxi services, and offering directions. As an addicted-to-ice American, I even had that available from the lower-level kitchen! My room was lovely, and large compared to other places I have stayed in Paris. Of course, I was most fortunate to have a room on the 5th floor with a gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower, glittering at night like a diamond pendant hanging from the sky. The hotel has recently undergone a decor change (from most online photos). The subtle tones of ecru, plum, green, and burgundy are most relaxing after a long day of working, walking, and sight seeing. The rooms are cleaned daily and everything in my room and bath was always spotless! Breakfast at the hotel is a bargain, particularly with a large pot of coffee, juice, eggs, and all of the wonderful pastries of Paris. Convenient to the hotel is the metro stop---the easiest and fastest way to get around Paris. From my metro I could travel with no difficulty to the area of the Louvre, Grand Boulevards, the Marais, Latin Quarter, and the outer areas of Paris.

Only needed to use Metro once. Don't miss Monet's WALLS of Water Lilies in the de l'Orangerie museun on the border of the beautiful Tuileries Garden which is in front of the Louvre. Monet's pond, gardens & house (Giverny) is worth the trip.- 50 miles north of Paris. If you can't fit it in -on the right bank is the Marmottan-Claude Monet museum. It has many of Monet's work. The most beautiful stained glass was in Saint Chapelle - not to be missed. We couldn't have found a sweeter hotel in a better spot.

The very friendly but absolutely incompetent girl at the desk simply apologized but did not provide any kind of solution. We were basically told to grin and bear it, as it was a holiday in Paris and there was no staff to fix it. Changing rooms was not a possibility either. Later on the day, we asked for an iron, which of course was not available in the room. My husband was sent to a steamy room in the basement and had to iron his shirt himself, as again, there was no staff/laundry service available. The last straw was when, having tickets for the Opera, we asked Reception to book a taxi for us with an hour in advance. The girl said that it was not necessary to book it that early, as 10 minutes was enough. Of course, the taxi she called was over 15 minutes late, so we started to get worried and went out to the street to get one ourselves. Guess what? When we are sitting inside the car, already running late and risking missing the show we had booked months in advance, she ran outside to the street, opened the door, and demanded us to get off the car immediately as \"she had already called a taxi for us and we could not cancel it\". We replied it was her own fault as she had evidently called it too late, but she was mad and demanded the taxi driver to stop. Just then the other taxi arrived, and we were forced to get in it. By the time we got there, we barely had time to get to our seats a minute before it started. We were so stressed and shocked that the whole evening was ruined.

We were also very surprised to find that the room was completely different then anything we saw here or on the hotel website. It was 10 times better! With a super modern Paris vibe, the colors were relaxing and sensual and the Hotel all together was the perfect place to begin our European honeymoon. After the two little mishaps, we had during our stay, the desk was nice enough to give us a 6pm check out on our last day, we only asked because our train didn't leave for Italy until 730pm that night. There is not one negative thing to say, the staff was lovely, the room elegantly appointed (make sure to ask for a corner room on the top floor, you get the best view and a little balcony!) and the Hotel breakfast was also a great way to start the day.

The avenues around the hotel are wide and the streets are populated but not crowded, so you feel safe walking home at night. We didn't bother with breakfast in the hotel as there are nice bakeries, cafes and brasseries nearby and it was fun to check them out each morning - these are all cheaper than the hotel too. We ate some fantastic evening meals in Paris but I'll just mention the best one locally here - Le P'tit Troquet, 28 rue de l'Exposition. It only has about 6 or 7 tables and is like sitting in an antiques shop. At 32 Euros for 3 courses we thought it was great value for such quality. English is spoken and we felt it was a nice discreet French experience. There are livelier places - the hotel recommends No 7 de vins for some reason, but we found their food bland, mostly cold, and more expensive - though the staff were welcoming and friendly. The mini bar back at the Duquesne is good value as these things go. And a nice half bottle of wine rounds the evening off well.

Although the hotel is being refurbished at the moment, which meant that the corridors were in the process of being decorated, we were fortunate to be in a newly refurbished room, and everything was immaculate. Very tasteful decor,everything spotlessly clean, and comfortable beds and pillows. The room was big enough and had great wardrobe space and an immaculate bathroom with a great shower and boiling hot water. It took us a long time to work out how to open the mini bar but it was fun trying! We were incredibly lucky to get room 55 with twin beds as I had requested - I draw the line at sharing a double with my mum! The views from 55 are really breathtaking - the tower is so much more impressive by night, and Les Invalides is equally stunning. We could even see Sacre Coeurs in the distance! Obviously not all the rooms can offer this view but it's only a 15 minute walk to get to the real thing and it's a lovely walk too. The location of the hotel is fantastic - metro stations close by and easy to walk to Musee Rodin, Les Invalides and of course to the Tower and River. We also walked to the D'Orsay and across to the Place de La Concorde. The staff at this hotel were brilliant. All spoke perfect English and were so helpful, planning metro routes and offering advice. We would recommend the dinner cruise on the Bateau Parisiennes - at 95 euros it wasn't cheap, but we were treated like royaly, the food was delicious and there was more wine than we could drink, along with great music and the breathtaking views of all the sights along the river. It was a spectacular end to our four day break, and my Mum loved every minute. We recommend the Thai restaurant adjacent to the hotel, and the Italian just round the corner. I can't imagine how anyone could be disappointed by this hotel, and although the view is a bonus, it's still worth visiting because of the lovely decor, comfort, friendly staff and fantastic location.

When we needed to place to stay during a spur-of-the-moment weekend trip to Paris, I defaulted to this hotel without really considering any other. Coincidentally, we got the same room, #21. While the rooms are indeed small, one must understand that one's in Paris, not Pittsburgh. It's one of the most visited (read: expensive) cities in the world. For the money we spent, I think we received great value. Here's why (and my more general comments apply to both visits): ALL of the staff were friendly, helpful, and thoughtful. The front desk staff, notably Eric, couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. When we arrived early, via the Thalys, he not only got us into an available room, but provided us with coffee, juice, and croissants to \"raise our energy level\". In the evening, he'd greet us and offer a glass of wine or an espresso. Our room, while small, was quite comfortable. We heard no street noise thru the window, and either no guest was inconsiderate or the rooms' soundproofing is excellent . Yes, as one reviewer mentioned, the room's decor was in need of an update; the hotel owner, however, is in the process of completely renovating the entire hotel. Evidently, the upper floors' rooms have been completed and the lower floors and lobby are next in line. The room and bathroom were very clean, as was the rest of the hotel. Beds were comfortable, even to a man with a bad back and arthritic hip, both of which were aggravated by walking the length and breadth of the city. I cannot comment on the breakfast (other than the snack we were offered). With so many wonderful bakeries, cafes, and markets nearby, why eat in the hotel? Additionally, the neighborhood in which the hotel is located is excellent. It's quiet, safe, and relatively non-touristy.

The room is small (remember you're in Europe), but it was enough space for my husband and I to cuddle in on a cold rainy week in romantic Paris! There are some good reveiws on here about what room to stay in to have an Eiffel Tower view. We tried to get the corner room on the top floor (floor 5), but it was booked, so we stayed in the room next door. The view was good - you had to step out on the balcony to enjoy it - you couldn't see it from the bed, but we didn't spend a lot of time in the room anyway, so it worked out great for us! I'm sure there are other hotels with bigger rooms and a better veiw, but for a romantic view on a budget - this is well worth it. I wouldn't recommend taking the airport taxi bus that they advertise there - my husband and I (with both strong stomachs) were SO car sick. We waited and waited - they were about 45 minutes late, and then had to pick up other guests at other hotels, and waited SO long (waited in the hot stuffy bus for about another 45 minutes) and then by the time we got to the airport, we were so sick we couldn't even think about getting on a plane for 9 hours! I think it would have been much better to drag the luggage to the metro and do it that way - that's the way we got from the airport to the hotel, so it's not too bad. You must eat at Cafe Panis! It's right across the bridge from Notre Dame and the decor is warm, and the staff is excellent! We loved it so much we went back a second time. The food is more reasonably priced and so very tasty. I would definitely recommend Paris at this time of year. You won't see the trees blooming or lots of flowers everywhere, but there is still some pretty green grass and the emaculate architecture is the same no matter what the season!

Our room was adorable -- small (as most European hotel rooms are), and very tidy. We had hoped for a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, and even though all rooms with this view had been booked solid for weeks, the staff managed to squeeze us in when someone else canceled. Our room had a spectacular view, encompassing the Tower as well as Basilique du Sacre Couer (and the Ecole Militaire, naturally, since the hotel is so close to this building). The (Ecole Militaire) Metro stop was two blocks away, and conveniently goes directly (no transfers) to stops near shopping at major department stores (les grand magasins) such as Printemps and Galleries Lafayette, as well as the Pont Neuf and the Louvre. The 7e neighborhood (where the hotel is based) is full of character as well as great sites to visit within easy walking distance (including parks, the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e, Napoleon's Tomb -- and the Eiffel Tower, of course). The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly! We really appreciated the room w/ view, as well as Metro directions, airport shuttle information, and all-around helpfulness. We did not eat the hotel breakfast, but chose to go to the local grocery store, butcher and bakers for food to stock up in our room's mini-fridge, which was quite cold (most hotel room fridges are inadequately cold to really keep food in). Restaurants in the area are pricey (cafes, too) -- even for Paris -- and I recommend saving some money and exploring the neighborhood by doing local shopping instead of eating out every meal. On a side note, it was truly unfortunate that the hotel was filled with obnoxious tourists. We ended our Western Europe vacation in Paris, and we certainly saw ignorant travelers from every culture (not just the stereotypical \"ugly Americans\"). However, the folks staying at this hotel tried our patience, even in passing in the halls. For example, one woman barged into a conversation I was having with the front desk person, inquiring loudly for a \"map in English.\" The staff person politely did not appear shocked at this ridiculous request, and provided a map from a wall display while explaining that they had maps, but the street names and monuments would be in French, not English. The woman completely missed how her request had been asinine, and continued to say in a condescending tone, \"Well, then I guess I'll have to learn to speak FRENCH then, now won't I?\" Well, yes, a passing attempt at conversational French would be nice when you visit France. So would some basic knowledge about travel, like the fact that maps do not translate street names from the original language into other languages to suit you. How would you find \"Pont Neuf\", if it were called \"New Bridge\" on the map??? Other than our fellow tourists, the hotel itself was delightful. Great location, clean room, helpful staff.

We just got back from our trip. We found this hotel on tripadvisor.com, and the experience was great. Amandine, Julie and Estelle (and their other team mates) were very helpful (and are still being helpful even though we have already checked out.. more on that later) As this was a wedding anniversary trip, we were very happy to stay at the Duquesne Eiffel.. we stayed in 2 different rooms, #54 and #35 and the view was super.. My birthday was on 8/31, and we were given #35, with the fabulous view of the sparkling eiffel tower, for our last night in Paris. What a super birthday present and way to end our trip to Europe! How many people can really say they had a view of the Eiffel tower? From my first email to our departure, the team at Duquesne Eiffel were very helpful, and thankfully communicated in English very easily (all I had was some junior high school french to rely on!) We stayed a total of 4 nights, and checked out to travel to Belgium for a few days in the middle of the week, and we were able to leave some of our luggage at the hotel, which helped us immensely to be able to travel easier on the trains to Brussels and Brugge, and back to Paris. The location of the hotel is by far the best, in terms of convenience to the metro stop (L'Ecole Militaire), Rue Cler, the Supermarche, as well as the Eiffel tower and museums like the Rodin, Musee D'Orsay and Invalides Militaire (Napoleon's tomb). The neighborhood was very safe as well and there were never any concerns about safety, even late at night. The rooms were very clean and neat. Thank you to the cleaning staff! Amandine also helped us book the \"Eiffel tower dinner/cruise on the Seine/show at the Lido\" which was the perfect combination of things to do while in Paris (not to mention a perfect birthday celebration!). That package encompassed 3 of the many things we wanted to do while in Paris. And I can't forget to mention that the hotel also helped by booking the YELLOW van to pick us up at CDG to bring us to the hotel. We received very clear directions on what we needed to do, once we landed in Paris, to ensure we met the driver (needed to pick up any phone and dial the toll free number BEFORE we went to baggage claim.. The man on the other end spoke english, who then told us what door to meet him at). I had been nervous about this procedure, as I couldn't understand how we would be able to make a call, without putting in any coins or using a telephone card, but it worked very easily. Last but not least, Estelle has been helping us contact Thalys, the high speed train to/from Brussels, to see if they found a print of Brugge we inadvertently left behind on the train, when we arrived back in Paris. Thalys hasn't been very responsive to her messages yet, but we are very appreciative of her efforts on our behalf. We are hoping for the best. We gave her our email address as we were checking out the following morning to head back to the States and she said she was going to keep trying to see if she can get some answers for us. This just shows us that the staff at Duquesne Eiffel are truly customer service - oriented. We highly recommend this hotel because of its location, and staff and cannot wait to stay again when we are visiting Paris (and hopefully it is sooner than a 20th wedding anniversary!)

Although the rooms are small and bijou they are clean, and the bathroom is lovely, very tiny but with bath, shower & loo, what more do you want. To lie in the bath with glass of champagne, looking out of french windows directly at the Eiffel tower is heaven! Mini bar prices very reasonable with good selection. Satellite TV was limited though - CNN or MTV, would be nice to have BBC news and maybe Sky 1 & Cartoon Network if you have kids travelling with you. We did not breakfast in the hotel, as we preferred to try the french pastries on the numerous cafes terraces nearby, but the breakfast room looked lovely. Lift access to all floors. The staff were good, they booked us a lovely dinner cruise which was wonderful, go with the hotels choice as it was the cheapest and we had a wonderful 3 course meal, but go for the 50 Euro option not the 69 euros with drinks included, as the drinks were 1 cocktail, 1 water and 1 coffee. We had 3 cocktails each for the difference in price structure. The hotel is in a lovely district, a short stroll from bars and restaurants & supermarkets. Very close to the military museum. Lovely street market a few blocks from hotel on a Sunday. The Ecole Militaire metro is 5 minutes walk and takes you all over Paris. I would advise anyone going for longer than a few days to get the Paris Pass online well before you go, we did this and it saved us a fortune, gives you access to 60 museums and attractions, a metro ticket for the duration of your stay and allows you to queue jump! A word of warning, if you hate crowds & are visiting Palace of Versailles, go early, it is heaving with tourists all being herded like cattle around the rooms! Also to get the best view of Paris, do the Tour Montparnesse, 38 seconds in the lift, takes you 56 floors to a bar and 360 degree panoramic views. Much less crowded than Eiffel with the bonus of watching the Eiffel's light show after dark on the hour. wait til after 10 pm though to miss crowds and see paris by night. For the very brave, walk the extra floor to the terrace and have an open air view! So, fab hotel, great staff, lovely room. Remember space is of a premium in Parisien hotels, so nowhere will be huge unless the cost is as huge as the rooms. I would highly recommend this hotel for value, area and views.

We paid out (a lot!) for the Premier Service but it was a really wonderful evening. Tips Hotel bar and mini-bar prices were a LOT cheaper than local bars and restaurants. If touring Paris by Metro be prepared to walk a lot - not many escalators and lots of steps and tunnels. Also, I wouldn't recommend the RER & Metro as a good way to get to your hotel from CDG unless you are travelling very light. If you book an airport transfer or similar make sure you book the time using the 24 hour clock - then your 5:45 pm pick up won't arrive at 5:45 am and provide an unexpected early wake up call!! Don't go to the Palais de Versailles on a Monday - it's closed! But if you do go make sure you take in the Domain du Marie-Antoinette - beautiful. And don't be afraid to hop on the 'Petit Train'. Those gardens are big! Finally, check how many Metro & RER trips you are going to make and where you are going to go. You need quite a few trips to make it worthwhile (although it's very convenient) and ensure that the regions covered are sufficient for your journey - it's a pain having to get of a train to buy another ticket for the last leg of your journey. Obvious but worth noting - you'll get the best out of Parisiennes if you at least try and speak a little French - most you'll come into contact with will speak English (except train station employees) but all seem to appreciate an attempt at thier native tongue.

We wondered if it was worth the trouble, since we didn't get in until late afternoon, and the weather was closing in. We took the Air France shuttle to the Gare Montparnasse, and rolled our luggage mostly downhill the mile or so to the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel. The shuttle gave us a wonderful view of the city, and passed some spectacular sights we would not have seen otherwise. We chose the hotel based on the reviews on this website. We were warmly greeted at the hotel and given Room 51, a \"superior\" room, as we had requested, with a view from the balcony of the Eiffel Tower. As stated by many, the European rooms are a bit smaller than standard U.S. rooms, and this one was no exception. The room was nicely appointed, clean and had a modern and roomy bath. The view from the balcony was wonderful. Although we were ready to collapse, we rallied and walked all the way around the Louvre complex , then returned along the Seine back to visit the Eiffel Tower. By then it was 9:30 and we were amazed that the sun still had not set! We were getting chilly, so we started heading back toward the hotel across the Parc du Champs-de-Mars where we could look back and see the lights come on the ET. We passed the Ecole Militaire and dined at one of the restaurants recommended by travelers on this site: Le Terrasse. Although it was too cool to sit outside, we did plenty of people watching, with a Metro stop directly in front of the restaurant and lots of people on the streets and in the restaurant. Our waiter was wonderful, bringing us glasses of kir and snacks while we perused the menu. He gave us very lively appraisals of some of the items on the menu! The French onion soup was excellent. Although it was 11:30 on a Thursday night, we felt very safe walking back to the hotel, because the streets were as busy as they are at lunch time in the U.S.! In the morning we raced out to soak up some more atmosphere, enjoying a croissant and cafe at a small corner restaurant. The helpful staff ordered a taxi to take us to the airport and we were off -- with fond memories and an eagerness to return to the Hotel Duquesne soon for a more leisurely taste of Paris!

Even after the hotel was booked, our friend called the hotel to confirm we received a room with a view. You can imagine our surprise when we did not receive this room. When we went down to the front desk their answer was that we must have misunderstood them when we booked and a room with a view is not guaranteed.

NOTE: If you want a room with a view, I would highly recommend that you call or email in advance to ask for it! They responded to our email and said that all the rooms with views were booked, but if they had any cancellations, they'd put us in one of those rooms. When we arrived, the woman at the front desk knew our name and told us that she had moved us into a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower! What a nice surprise! Even if you don't have a view, the location of this hotel is perfect. A 10-minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, a 5-minute walk to Invalides, and a 5-minute walk to the subway stop. There are many restaurants and cafes nearby, with a wide range of prices and cuisine. The staff at the hotel was great. They were helpful with directions, offered to book tickets for us, and many other things (like giving us glasses with ice for the soft drinks we bought at the store!). They even had converters for us to borrow for the duration of our stay! Everyone we met was very friendly and tried to help make our stay pleasant. The room was a bit small by American standards, but a good size by European standards. The bathroom was the same. Everything was very nice and clean, which was our main concern. The air conditioner in the room was wonderful! One thing to note - the walls are a bit thin and you can sometimes hear people in the other rooms and in the hallway... mainly just when people were being loud, but something to be aware of. It never caused us any problems though. Overall, we were quite pleased with our choice of this hotel. It met or exceeded all of our expectations.

Imagine our incredible disappointment when we arrived to find that the room for Grandma and the kids #35 did have a good view of the tower, but the room that they put me and my husband in , #54, did NOT have a view of the tower. When I went downstairs, to ask to be moved to the room that they'd advertised, the clerk slammed things around, and informend me that yes, the room WAS a superior room. I just had to GO OUT ON MY BALCONY, and look way around to the right, and then I could see it. First, if you're at all afraid of heights, there's no way you're going out on that balcony. Second, you can't stay out there, it's far to narrow. The hotel staff was COMLETELY unconcerned that the romantic evening they'd advertised was in fact a lie. In fact, there are only 3 rooms in the hotel with a view of the tower out your window as they advertise, but many more than that with NO view of the tower out your window that they classify as SUPERIOR. So, if you think that you're going to get one of the good ones for certain just because you book a superior room, DON'T COUNT ON IT!

Les Invalides (Napoleon's tomb) is practically a stone's throw away. The rooms themselves are quite spacious for a Paris hotel as I've stayed in places in Paris before that were slightly bigger than a kitchen drawer. The rooms look as if they've been recently renovated with marble/granite bathroom countertops that are nicely cleaned everyday. There is a good breakfast - I particulary appreciated the fresh fruit - and all the amenities one could expect in a hotel (i.e. soap, lotion, dryer, internet, etc). Above all, however, I must single out the staff who were all exceptional. Muhammed, Amandine, Estelle and the cleaning and wait staff were a delight to deal with and they went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. (How Parisians get their reputation for being snotty, I'll never know, but I'm guessing it has as much to do with the visitor as with the way the French respond to certain attitudes). The cherry on the cake, of course, was the view of the Eiffel Tower from our rom with its glorious shimmering lights at night.

We ate breakfast at the hotel and found it worthwhile. If you don't have much time in Paris, and there is so much to see, eat a quick breakfast at the hotel. For me, I needed my morning coffee before we set out. If you need to experience a cafe, have coffee, hot chocolate, or a glass of wine later in the afternoon instead. Be sure to eat dinner at Carmine's (and italian restaurant in Paris). It's just beyond the Ecole Militaire metro stop. The food, the prices, the staff - it was all a wonderful experience.

The weather was very nice during this time. Not too hot and not too cold. The hotel was the first one of three that we stayed at during our trip to France. It was our 10th wedding anniversary so I wanted a romantic hotel with a great location. The Duquesne Eiffel Hotel did not disappoint. When making my reservation I explained this was a special anniversary trip & I would like a room with a nice view of the Eiffel tower. The hotel delivered! The view was breathtaking and I was up late ever night enjoying the light show of the Eiffel Tower from our room. We had room 301. I had booked my reservation directly with the hotel (via email), they were very prompt in their responses and made me feel comfortable that my reservation would be in order when I arrived. The Hotel is close to Napoleon's tomb, The Military Academy, Rue Cler, walking distance to the Eiffel Tower (a 20 minute walk that is very pleasant during the day) and there are many close restaurants and small bakeries. All the restaurants that we went to were very good, and they spoke English if needed. There is even a grocery store about 4 blocks away, so you can stock up on snacks. Don't miss trying the Orange flavored Coke they sell there. The hotel staff was wonderful, everyone working there was polite and helpful. They were great at giving information and helping to make reservations. If you do not know French the staff spoke fluent English. I have often read about hotel rooms in Paris being small. So I was prepared for a small room, but to be honest I did not think this room was too small. It was exactly what I needed. I was in Paris to see Paris, not hang out in a hotel room. So it served our needs well. I think that people who stated the room was too small have never stayed in a hotel in New York City (now those rooms are small !!!!). The bathrooms was a nice size. The room was very clean and the maid service was prompt & complete. We did have breakfast there when we arrived. I found it expensive for what we received. It was nice to have to there on the grounds, but you will find bakeries just a few blocks away for a better price. I would recommend this hotel to other travelers. Some notes about the area & traveling: RUE CLER: If going to the Rue Cler I would go by this schedule: The market is at its best Tue-Sat 8:30-13:00 or 17:00-19:00, Sun 8:30-12:00, dead on Mon. Which I found on this site: http://www.ricksteves.com/plan/destinations/france/ruecler0208.htm. I also had to put my French into high gear when eating at a restaurant on the Rue Cler. The staff did not speak English and I did not know how to ask for my leftovers to go. BATEAUX PARISIENS We went on an evening dinner boat cruise with Bateaux Parisiens. http://www.bateauxparisiens.com/ It was a bit expensive but worth it, the meal was delicious and the atmosphere was lovely. We sat by the boat's side window, I think if you were stuck in the middle of the boat you might not have had such a great view. The tour is priced according to where you sit on the boat. The band played a nice variety of music, so I think all age groups would like something they played. We walked back to the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel after dinner. (A 20 minute walk) I must admit not being too familiar with the area I was a little nervous about the walk back. I would not recommend the walk back for senior citizens, there were also no taxis in that area at night. Perhaps the Bateaux Parisiens would call for a taxi if you ask. We did get to see many teenagers \"mooning\" the boat as we traveled down the Seine. It must be a ritual. So have your cameras ready ;-) The monuments were lit up and were beautiful to see from the boat. We did dress up for this dinner, but we noticed many people were not too dressed up, it varied. I wish I had known we did not need a suit and dress or I would have been able to pack lighter. They also have a lunch tour. VAN SERVICE: When booking a room at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel we were given the name of a van service that we could reserve to pick us up at the airport and take us to the hotel. I would NOT recommend this service. First when reserving it they tell you to call them as soon as you get off the plane, not to pick up your luggage first. I followed there instructions, and called them upon arrival. The man said hurry up and get outside the van is getting ready to leave. Since we did not get out luggage yet it took a few minutes, then we had to get to the location were he told us to go. This location was not easy to get to. It look us 20 minutes just to get on an elevator to get to the street level. We then found the van, and the driver acted like he didn't know we were coming, he was very rude and ignored us when we asked him questions (and we asked in French). After leaving us stand there for 10 minutes while he talked on the phone he said to get in the van & he would take us, like he was doing us a favor. It was not a very friendly welcome to France. Thankfully the rest of our trip was not like the arrival. TAXI RESERVATION: When leaving the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel we were heading for the train station, so we needed a taxi. Apparently taxis are very hard to get especially during rush hour. I was booking the taxi a day in advance and I was still not sure if I would get one. The woman at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel desk was very helpful at getting me the taxi.

We wanted a good quality, three star hotel in a good location, but most hotels seemed either very expensive (in most cases overpriced, I'm sure) or just poor in quality. Because we were quite late with our booking as well, finding a good one (I was very careful to read reviews on all possible places) seemed pretty much impossible-- that is until my boyfriend stumbled upon Duquesne Eiffel. We both had a good feeling about the place, based on reviews in particular, and we were definitely not disappointed! First of all, the LOCATION IS GREAT. I cannot emphasize this enough. It is close to the Eiffel Tower and a stone's throw away from Napoleon's tomb (hotel des Invalides) right next to the military academy. 5 minutes away is the metro station and along the way a wonderful little bakery and a couple of restaurants. While it is so close to two of the main tourist attractions in Paris, its still a very quiet, nice and safe area. With the metro you can get anywhere in within minutes and even walking to the Louvre is possible! As we arrived we were greeted by a polite young receptionist and she quickly confirmed out booking, filled in the paperwork and gave us our key. The room was on the third floor (there's only 5, its very cosy and nice, clean and charming) and we were absolutely thrilled when we got in, saw the room and especially our view! Now, the room was small, but for a weekend trip this shouldnt be a problem unless you are fussy about space. It was nicely decorated (blue and yellow), everything was good quality and clean and the overall feeling was very charming and French! The bathroom was a very positive surprise because it had a big window and a bathtub, all very modern and tastefully done (nice bathtub and new showerhead). And now to the view- from both windows (room and bathroom) we had a view of the Eiffel Tower! This, I imagine even in Paris, is by no means standard and I'm sure many people pay a lot more than we did to have it! It was so gorgeous at night (although the cynical Parisians apparently disagree ;) and an incredible perk for an already positive experience. We stayed for 3 days and have no complaints at all.

The price was Euro 145 a night. Continental breakfast plus scrambled eggs and bacon was an additional Euro 11. The staff was friendly and helpful and all spoke English very well. The Duquesne is in a pleasant neighborhood, a five-minute walk from the Metro (Ecole Militaire). I was a little concerned that the location would be too far from the middle of the downtown area, but if you like walking (and if the weather's good), you can get pretty much everywhere on foot without too much trouble. It's about 20 minutes to walk to the Eiffel Tower, maybe 40-45 minutes to the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, Notre Dame, Louvre, etc. Otherwise, a Metro pass will be money well spent as the subway in Paris will get you absolutely everywhere and the trains run every 4-5 minutes, if not even more frequently.

When we arrived to book in we were told that a \"regular customer\" had decided to stay an extra night and that they had no room for us even though we had booked on line months before our trip. The hotel found us a room in a nearby hotel which we stayed in for our first night of the trip but then the next morning we had to check out of this hotel and head back to the Duquesne Eiffel hotel to check in, not an ideal situation. Another couple staying in the hotel the same weekend had a similar problem, they had a room but it was not the room they had booked. The hotel itself is quite nice, the staff are very friendly, the rooms are nice and the location is good too. When checking out of the hotel I paid by credit card, I then noticed a week later that the hotel had taken a further payment from my credit card, they never contacted me to say they were making a further deduction or give an explanation for the deduction.

They were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a few hiccups during our stay which they smoothed out with a smile as quickly as possible. (Some issues with the room key, and also our reservation was mistakenly taken down for one night rather than two.) They were also helpful with restaurant reservations, metro directions, etc. We stayed in two 'superior' rooms at 180 euro per night. The first was pretty basic but acceptable - certainly nothing overtly super about it - clean to a reasonable standard but not to, say, 5 star standard. There were some scuff marks on the walls, slight peeling, etc, but the room did appear to have recieved care, just to be a little bit aging. The second was room 56, with a little balcony and a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower from the desk and from the bed. This room was much preferred! I'd ask for it by number if I stayed here again. The rooms are average European hotel sized, which Americans will find relatively small. This being Paris, you won't spend time in the room anyway. For our purposes, the location left a bit to be desired - however, we are a bit of a party couple in our late 20s and we like to be able to walk to nightlife. On the other hand, it's a 5 minute walk to the Metro and the hotel is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. It was also quite easy to take a taxi back to the hotel provided one can remember how to say '23 Ave Duquesne' in French at the end of a night out! If I were looking for a peaceful relatively inexpensive hotel in Paris I'd definitely stay here again. I'd send my parents here, for example. But next time we come we will probably try to stay somewhere with a bit more street life. PS - I'd have to say the Rue Cler is our least favorite place in Paris by a wide margin. It's full of tourists from Ohio talking loudly in English and generally being annoying.

We made a right decision. We stayed in two different rooms: Room #25 for the first 4 nights, and in Room #56 for another 2 nights after coming back from our overnight trip to MSM/ San Malo. Both chambles were worth the rate -- cleaned everyday, hot nice shower always. Room #25 (on the second floor): Only the top 1/3 of the Tower Eiffel was seen, but the room was quite spacious for Paris standard -- two opened suites cases, no problem. Shower w/ bathtub, separate bathroom. Room #56 (on the top floor): Marvelous view of the Tower Eiffel through the window/ from the balcony, especially when lighted up at night. It even twinkled every hour, at 9, 10 11 and 12 midnight, which perfectly highlighted our stay in Paris. Though the room and bed were rather small, we fitted OK, but may not be such a recommendation for larger people. Shower w/ bathtub, bathroom in the same room. Service: All the staffs were always so pleasant. People at the reception spoke very good English and helped us finding our way getting around Paris, they were always quite busy helping out people. We also liked breakfast in our room, nice caf\u00e9 and kind ladies who brought the plate with nice smile. Food (dinner): Our No.1 recommendation is 7 me Sud, 10 minutes from the hotel, on the Mont Piquet Ave, always packed with locals and tourists. Try their 20 euros course menu. I had Foie Gras as entr\u00e9e, Dug Fillet as main plate, and candied pear w/ vanilla ice cream as dessert. The best a la carte was Escargot (in Takoyaki plate).

Hotels recommended by friends were booked, but the Dusquene Eiffel was available. The great Trip Advisor reviews clinched it. The only room type available online was the comfort double, but the attentive staff responded with the offer of an upgrade to a superior room. Based on reviews, I chanced requesting Room 55, and it was available for four of the five nights we wanted. The fifth night was in room 25. The room and the hotel were wonderful. All rooms ending in 5 are corner rooms with views of the Eiffel Tower through french doors. Room 55 at the top of the hotel has the best view and a two-sided balcony from which you also can see Sacre Coeur and Les Invalides. The star attraction, of course, is the Eiffel Tower. At night, it sparkles in your window on the hour with the lights installed for the Millennium celebration. Magical, and surely one of the best views in all of Paris. Room 56 next door is smaller but also has direct views of the Tower from the bed. It would be nice if the hotel would put flower boxes and a couple of small chairs and a little table on the balcony. That would make it perfection. The hotel staff is everything the reviews say and more. They are knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and cheerful and will gladly suggest and make reservations at restaurants and even provide a computer-generated map to them. Even though we had been to Paris before, we really appreciated the advice of the staff. Special kudos to Amanda and Pritti. As others have said, Rue Cler is just a couple of blocks away behind the Ecole Militare Metro stop. This is a great place for coffee and a pain du chocolat in the morning though your table mates may be Americans armed with Rick Steve's Paris guide. There are wonderful cheese and chocolate shops and a nice patisserie. At the Ecole Militare Metro stop there is a small supermarket with a good selection of wine, fruit and staples. Use the Metro and invest in the Paris Visite pass, which is good for one to five days of unlimited public transit rides and discounts to some museums and attractions. Buy them at the Metro stations. We like mussels and went to one of the many Lyon de Bruxelles restaurants. It's a chain, but if moules are your passion, they are good and reasonably priced here. The nicest restaurant experience of the trip was at Fermette Marbeuf (5 Avenue Marbeuf). Its domed ceiling and tile work were enchanting and the food was superb. There's a 30 Euro fixed-price menu that is well worth selecting. We embellished it a bit, added wine and coffee and the tab was only 101 Euro, service included, for a special night of elegant service and wonderful cuisine. All in all, a lovely time at a lovely hotel with a lovely staff and a lovely view. A few reviewers seemed disenchanted with their rooms, but they seemed unused to the size of European hotel rooms and the prevalence of glass half-doors on showers. True, some of the rooms at Dusquene Eiffel are small and more basic, but if you can plan a little request room 55 or any of the corner rooms ending in 5.
