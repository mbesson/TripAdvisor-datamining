In the area of nice little cafes and restaurants too, not far from St. Mark's square, if I remember correctly. It seemed a little shady how we had to call someone, who'd then come and let us in though, and we never seemed to see anyone at reception. Breakfast was also just some pre-packeaged crossiants and orange juice..had to stop at cafes to get something decent.

Make sure you print out their directions and follow them explicitely, or you will never find this tiny (6 rooms) hotel, which is located in a back alley. When we got to the hotel the door was locked and no one was in the lobby (it was the middle of the afternoon). There were two buzzers by the door. We had to keep ringing them for about 10 minutes until someone finally answered and buzzed us in. The key was on the front desk and our room was across from reception. The free Internet didn't work and the room phone only rang in reception, where no one was. So I went outside, buzzed again and was told the Internet password, which didn't help. After going back and forth a few times it was clear that Internet wasn't working. Two days later the owner finally showed up, reset the router and now we had Internet. Not great service in my book. The room itself was pretty nice and a comfortable size, the free breakfast was skimpy and only included a few rolls, juice and coffee, nothing else. The location was the best part, near San Marco and boats to everywhere. If you are totally self sufficient and don't require reliable internet service or standard hotel services (no one there to help with directions, bookings, restaurant recommendations, check-in, wake up calls, etc) then this a good budget choice. If you want a hotel with services look elsewhere. If I were to go back to Venice I wouldn't stay here again.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cSecluded charming quiet\u201d", "Author": "Chambesy", "ReviewID": "UR118196856", "Content": "The Locanda Ca' Valeri is close to Piazza San Marco and to the San Zacceria boat stop. Yet it is just distant enough to give you the feeling that Venice is yours and that you're not part of the tourist masses. The shops and restaurant in the area are different from those closer to the main tourist attractions. Ca' Valeri is also very quiet! Just around the corner of the tiny ally you'll find a lovely square with a good restaurant and the perfect local bar for your morning coffee with brioche. (Remember that in Italy prices are different for consumptions standing at the bar and sitting down at a table.) Service in the Locanda is limited. You'll find your key waiting for you on the counter with a note with your room number. My room was clean, decoration charming, antique, Murano glass lamps (see website http://www.locandacavaleri.com/). Bath room modern, elegant. Air conditioning low noise and good. The Jacuzzi wasn't working, neither was the TV. I didn't really mind. It was wonderful to lie in the large Jacuzzi tub even without the hydro-massage and a few days without television is always a relief. Davide the manager/owner promised he would have both repaired the day of my departure... Do check if he did! My colleague and I had breakfast in the bar around the corner on our way to work. When I needed to call a restaurant one evening I found the phone book in the office at the entrance and called myself. I would recommend this small, quiet, charming place to anyone who doesn't need to be looked after. If you want more service another hotel might be more convenient for you. I want to clarify that service wasn't bad. The people were in fact very friendly! But they were there only part of the time (never in the evenings). I loved the simple style and really enjoyed my stay. I'll go back the next time I go to Venice. The price for the room seemed reasonable 180 euro/night.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whittier, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "JosieQ11", "ReviewID": "UR115030122", "Content": "Hotel within walking distance of major sites but far enough away to escape the crowds.

There was no noise at all as there is a double door separating the room from the lobby. We paid 297 euros for 4 nights with a special buy 3 nights and get the 4th free. The room was very clean with two twin beds pushed together and a tacky yet cool murano glass chandelier hanging over the bed. There were two high windows that did not let in alot of light because of being on the lower floor and the buildings are so close together. But that did not matter, it was great for sleeping. The decor was pretty typical Italian style. The bathroom was fairly small and the toilet in an odd spot so you had to duck your knees under the sink but we managed fine. Breakfast is included with the room rate. Basically it is just packaged pastry, cookies and biscuits along with coffee, tea, cappucino and juice boxes. There is a kettle to boil water in the room. We bought some yogurt and fruit to go with it and it was all we needed to get us started and out into Venice for the real food! The room was cleaned daily, there was a mini fridge and air conditioning (great during the heat wave) but no safe.The couple things that I would have liked to be different were that the front desk person did not speak English at all when we arrived and after that we rarely saw anyone at the front desk. Apparently it is only manned during the day but even then we never saw anyone to ask questions and we ended up paying our bill in advance as we were worried that when the time came to leave there would be no one around. We left a note on the desk to get their attention. The key to the front door and our room was on a gigantic metal thing and it was so heavy we finally took the keys off and left it in the room. The best thing about it was the location. Just far enough from the madding crowds but only 10 minutes max walk to San Marco. Lots of good little restaurants close by as well as the Arsenale vaporetto. The hotel's directions were just fine and we found it without much problem, though keep in mind it is on a little dead end street and you must check for the hotel sign on the wall next to the iron grill door. If you want a clean, comfy bed to sleep in and a good location and don't want to pay alot then this could be the place for you. I would stay here again when on a budget conscious holiday. FYI: there did not appear to be an elevator. Their guest book had good reviews written in though a few comments about the hot water running out. Too many showering at the same time? We did experience that once over 4 days. Just waited a bit and tried again and it was fine.", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BHR Boutique Hotel Locanda Ca'Valeri", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d1145141-Reviews-BHR_Boutique_Hotel_Locanda_Ca_Valeri-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Castello 3845</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30122</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1145141", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/d9/bb/db/bhr-boutique-hotel-locanda.jpg"}}
