If you love cheesecake then head for the Cheesecake factory at the top of macy's in the city centre. Hubby loves cheesecake so that is where we headed - it is awesome!!! Just make sure you don't have 2 courses before your dessert as you will not have room for it - we always go main OR starter instead of both as American portions are gigantic. Really good value for money although beer is pricey everywhere in the US so soft drinks with free refills did the job for me (pregnant too so no real choice!). Recommend: do the night tour of Alcatraz - eerie but superb. Walk the crooked road (Lombard St.) and down the wharf. Eat at Fog City Diner for brekkie and then walk up to Coit Tower.

Heard a few \"running feet\" in the hallways, but no shouting or disruptive behavior. Just mentioning this, for those with small kids. About a 10-15 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 33 for trips to Alcatraz.

We attempted to make reservations about 5 weeks prior to our arrival but their website said that they were booked and no rooms were available. After reading other reviews on tripadvisor I saw that others encountered the same problem but called the hotel directly and were able to get a room. Same experience here - I called them and got the room that we needed. Checkin was very easy and the parking was FREE. We later learned just how rare this is in SF. We were given room #201, which faced Columbus Ave. We had a view of the street but it was not noisy at night. The bathroom overlooked the lane and side door of Bimbo's 365; a nightclub with quite a history. Again, not noisy at night. The room itself was not what I would call fancy, but who cares. It was clean and it was within easy walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf, cable cars, and Lombard St. On our first night we asked the front desk clerk for a good Chinese restaurant in the area and he recommeded Brandy Ho's about 8 blocks down Columbus Ave. We went there and it was fabulous (another review). We found that there were plenty of dining options in the area but decided to stop by Trader Joe's to pick up some random items like bottled water and some snacks that we could carry with us. The Columbus Motor Inn served as a great base of operations while we explored all of the attractions in the area: Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz, the Embarcadero, AT&T Park, the Golden Gate Bridge, Lombard St. We walked to all but the Golden Gate and AT&T Park. (Took ferry to Alcatraz obviously but the location to get on the ferry is fairly close to the hotel). We found the hotel to be secure and we never saw any questionable types hanging around. After exploring the area we discovered that the Columbus Motor Inn was pretty much on par with any of the other hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Most of them are fairly small with no frills. The thing that sets this hotel apart is the free parking and location. It is fairly equidistant to most of the attractions. I understand that people have varying expectations when they stay at a hotel. We usually stay at Marriotts, Sheratons, or Hyatts so we weren't sure about the place before checking in. In the end it turned out to be just fine and we are happy that we stayed there.

I asked what if it was full, they replied to double park the car,give them the keys and they'll fix it when someone leaves. I didn't use the car the whole vacation, but I think they have less parkingspaces than rooms. Anyway, I think it's a five minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf and about a 10-15 minute walk to Pier 33 for the Alcatraz Cruise. Walk down one block and then you're already at Lombard Street. Takes about a few minutes to climb up to the most crookedest part of the street and gives a nice few of North Beach. The cable car is one block to the east. One way ride costs you 5 dollar, all day pass 13 dollars. This will get you onto Union Square and Market Street in no time. I wouldn't recommend walking all the way to there, the cablecar is so much easier. Rooms were big enough, I loved the big TV and liked the in-room safe. We requested a room on Columbus Ave, but got one on the side. No problem. Didn't had any noise problems, could sleep without any problem. Requested a refridgerator, but it wasn't in the room, so they placed it the other day. Wifi was a problem though. Signal was fine but I couldn't get my Asus EeePC nor my iPod Touch 4G online using wifi. Luckily there was also a LAN cable located behind the nightstand, so I could still use my netbook.

I pull them back and just sleep under the sheet and blanket. While I'm not a germophobe, I just can't get past the thought that the spreads are rarely cleaned. With that being said, I think CMI should invest in better quality blankets. The one provided was thin and scratchy. We did appreciate the four pillows. Others have touched on the street noise (we were on the 3rd floor facing Columbus). It's a tradeoff, though---get the view such as it is with noise or less noise and face others bldgs I suppose. Our room was spacious with a large flatscreen, handy table and chairs, a French balcony (for standing--not sitting), sink outside bathroom which is handy so no one hogs one area entirely, plentiful towels, large dresser with many drawers, safe in closet, coffee maker with coffee and tea, etc. The garage is part of the building, btw, and it is so easy to access right from the hotel elevator.

Well, it was so loud, we could imagine ourselves standing outside in the middle of the street with cars whizzing by. No double-paned glass here! So, we trucked back downstairs with luggage to see if we could possibly make some other arrangement or get a recommendation for another place to stay. The clerk simply answered 'no' and 'no'.

The first night we arrived in SF we stayed in a 3rd floor room and asked for a \"quiet room.\" It was quiet alright. Looked out on an alley but believe me the silence was bliss after a flight from the East Coast and then a jam-packed afternoon exploring San Francisco. We then headed to Point Reyes and came back to the city on Saturday to meet up with friends. This time we had another 3rd floor room with a view. We worried because the nightclub next door (Bimbo's) was open and playing music that was reverberating but we fell asleep quickly after a busy day showing our friends around SF. After that we found out that Bimbo's is only open on a sporadic basis so no more noise. The view was wonderful--Coit Tower, TransAmerica building, and on and on. The free parking was a definite plus as others have stated. In fact I had considered a Westin (I think it was) where the rates were comparable but then noted that the parking fees were $50 per night! Plus rolling out of the hotel into North Beach was fantastic as this is one of the nicer sections of San Francisco. Many mentioned Mama's and Pat's for breakfast and I'm sure they're good but why not try some of the local cafes near Washington Square? Cafe Grecco comes to mind and there is a local chain called \"La Boulange\" which has wonderful granola and yoghurt, oatmeal, egg dishes, and of course pastries. We tried different ones every day and had fabulous coffee, pastries, egg dishes, you name it all good! We didn't use the transportation system much (have in the past and it is fantastic) but since it was just my husband, myself, my friend, and her son's 20 something girlfriend we walked easily to China Town. Fisherman's Wharf is rarely a place we go anymore but since this was my friend's first visit we walked down there and it was literally 3 blocks down Columbus. My husband and I also booked a tour called \"Taste of the City\" that was fabulous. We visited the fortune cookie factory in China Town, a tea-tasting shop, they were booked solid (the tour company) and therefore couldn't get us into the dim sum places so they got a local restaurant (Louis') to open up and they served us three large bowls filled with chow mein, sweet and sour pork, and fried rice--excellent. Thd gentleman with the restaurant served us some tea he grew on a mountainside in China! Our guide stayed with us long after the tour was supposed to be over and we had pizza in North Beach (Cinecetta I think) and enjoyed conversing with a group from Sweden and a young woman from Germany. As to the rooms: big room, flat screen tvs, in-room safe, bathroom and sink separated which makes it easier to get ready in the a.m., spotlessly clean, but I agree with an earlier reviewer that it would be nice if they had more pillows, ours seemed to be mini-sized!

I picked this place due to the reviews. I was a bit leery at first as I did not know the area very well. I wanted something that was clean, close to the wharf/Pier 39, reasonably priced, safe, free parking, and free internet. Well, this hotel fits the bill. The room was super clean and had a very nice large TV on the wall. The hotel is enclosed so the only way anyone can get in is via the lobby elevator/stairs. One of the cable car routes is just around the corner from the hotel on Taylor. Also, the the walk to the wharf is only about 4 blocks down the street(I would recommend going down Taylor as well for this. There is also a great breakfast place, Pat's, on Taylor which is only about a two minute walk from the hotel. This is probably the c losest you can get to the wharf and still stay at a really nice place but not pay an outrageous price. We did not move our car the entire time. You can walk to the wharf/ Pier 39. YOu can take the cable car from the wharf to Union Square and come back again(however it is 5 dollars per person one way but it is a lot of fun and worth the money) Then if you want to go some place else, the bus lines ( which are cheap) are right down the street from the hotel. They have free internet via wire and wireless. I had no problem connecting with my laptop. The front desk staff is super helpful and will be happy to direct you. The only negative thing is that there is not breakfast, no fridge, or microwave,. But, you can request a microwave for 5 dollars per day from what I understand. There is a Safeway, Trader Joes, and Walgreens downt the street. It is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, maybe even less if you walk fast. OUr room was right over Columbus which is a busy street. But, I had earplugs and did not hear a thing. However, the front desk staff seem very reasonable and would be willing to move you. If you are concerned about street noise, I would ask for a room near the back of the hotel when you make reservations. AND, don't let the BIMBOS sign next to the hotel scare you. This is a nightclub which holds all kids of private parties and events. Althought the name concerend me, I did not witness anything concerning. You can google the name and see fthe place for yourself and upcoming events. . I do have an 11 year old son and was a bit put off by the name, but that was all. . All in all, it is a place I will stay again and would highly recommened it to others. Oh yes, the directions from the hotel site state to turn down Houston once you are on Columbus. I have no idea where this is. Once you turn onto Columbus and see the hotel sign, the garage entrance is right there. Just turn in a find a spot. There are two levels of parking.

We attempted to change rooms because of the traffic noise and was told \"I guess you better find another hotel because our last room was booked online\". Obviously, our patronage was truly unappreciated. The front desk staff is very monotone and unfriendly which therefore creates an uninviting atmosphere.

Even though there are two floors of parking, it was rather limited. When I asked the manager about this, he said they generally only run out of parking if there is an event. Should they run out of room, you can double park your car in the lot and they will move it into a spot when one becomes available. Fortunately, I always had a spot. If you need to take a cab, they run very frequently and I never had a problem getting one. The rooms were quite large (even if we didn't get a room with a balcony) and clean. The flat screen TV was nice as well. The mattresses could have been a bit firmer in my opinion, but I like very firm mattresses. They do have wi-fi service, however, I found it to be a bit weak with my iTouch at times.

One thing to note, however, the nightclub next door is now open again (some people here had previously stated it was closed). We had a room on the third floor on the corner right next to the the club and you could hear the music slightly through the walls. I don't think there would be any problem if you got any of the other rooms facing the street and not the corner room or if you were staying during the week instead of over the weekend like us.

NOTE: You may be tempted to ask for a room away from the road, but I wouldn't do so. You're stuck (1) with not view facing the building next door and (2) You're stuck right next to the nightclub - certainly not more quiet then the street during the weekend. The traffic noise was minimal and wouldn't bother the average sleeper. Besides, it's not a huge interstate highway passing by the hotel anyway. Just a regular city street. Fisherman's Warf: This is a very touristy location and not the cute little warf you might imagine or remember from days gone by. Certainly take a stroll down to it to at least check out the sealions basking on the platforms, but I wouldn't recommend eating there unless you just want something basic. Instead, China Town and Little Italy is close by and offers a much better selection and quality of food. Cable Car: Purchase a day pass instead of simply a one-way or round trip ticket.

I checked out a king room while they were cleaning it and I would rather have a room like that. (We are both large people). We loved the black out curtains and after reading reviews here we requested a room on the 3rd floor and in the back because the hotel is located in a busy area and we are not use to street noises. Noise was minimal in our room. I think I heard noise once during my stay. The hotel staff was wonderful and accommodating. The hotel was very clean. Too me the rooms looked like my bedroom at home in a way and I loved the flat panel tv. There is a coffee maker in the room, a hair dryer and toiletries. The lights are set on a timer and that was new for us, but energy conserving. The hotel staff will recommend places for you to eat or anything else you would like to do in San Fran. I recommend you get a Citipass and use it to ride all the transportation available it is included in the price-cable cars, subways, buses, ect. It is good for 9 days And other attractions are included as well. It is worth the 54.00 and you can pick up at the trolley pay center.

I based our decision to stay here from all the great reviews on Trip Advisor. I wasn't disappointed. What a great location! We felt we were close to everything. The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. We arrived early and our request for early check in was granted. We weren't too pleased with our first room due to it's location (near the street and elevator), and immediately we were switched to another room near the back of the hotel where it was a lot quieter. The room was great. We had a king size bed and there was plenty of room for our family of three to move around. The room was clean (which is a very important factor for me). My husband was extremely pleased with the flat screen television. The bed was comfortable. I read from another traveler about the pillows having feathers so we took heed to the warning and brought our own pillows since we all have allergies. We walked everywhere. Approximately 5 block away (around the corner) is the bottom of Lombard Street where you get a great view of the infamous crooked street. Only a 15 - 20 minute walk to Fisherman's Pier and about the same up the street to the heart of North Beach. If you really enjoy walking, head up the street to Stockton and turn right, it will take you straight into China Town. If you continue on, you'll eventually end up at Union Square. We did this walk and enjoyed all the wonderful sights along the way. One of the best ways to see the city in my opinion! We'll definitely stay here again the next time we visit San Fran. Oh, I forgot to mention one of the hotel's highlights...the parking is FREE! Compared to the $40+/night at other hotels, you can't beat free. Plus we got a great internet rate of $79/night on the hotel's website. A couple of suggestions on places to eat (based on recommendation to us): San Sun in Chinatown: 941 Stockton St. Great food and inexpensive. Pictures of all the dishes are displayed which makes it a lot easier to order. U.S. Restaurant: 515 Columbus Ave. Good Italian food within walking distance from the hotel (approx. 15 min). Moderately priced. If you like teas, check out the Red Blossom Tea Company in Chinatown: 831 Grant Avenue. We sampled several teas before making our purchases. A highlight for me since I'm a tea lover! Note: On Bay St., approx. 2 blocks down from the hotel (heading towards Fisherman's Wharf), turn right and walk about 6 more blocks, you'll find a Trader Joes, Cost Plus, Barnes & Noble, Walgreens, and plenty of other stores. One last bit of advice: If you're planning on checking out the CA Science of Academy, I suggest getting there extremely early. We purchased our tickets in advance, but by the time we got there the lines were unbelievably long. It was a holiday week, but I heard that the lines had been long since it opened in September. The museum opened at 9 a.m. and there were people waiting for hours and arrived before it even opened. We ended up getting a refund because after waiting for two hours, we were yards away from the entrance. No signs of us getting in anytime soon. Also, finding parking and getting in/out of the park was an entire other nightmare! As an alternative, we went to the Discovery Museum near Fort Baker. A great place if you have kids! http://www.badm.org/ Wonderful views of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Better to drive and park nearby and then walk on bridge and take a few photos. When I saw the nieghboring hotels (Hilton, Sheraton, Marriot, Holiday Inn) I realized what an insane bargain this is.

Our floor, I think it was the 2nd floor, looked like it had been recently refurbed. Rooms were clean and spacious with large flat screen tv. We also had a little balcony, not that we had time to use it. Had coffee maker, ironing board and hairdryer. It was about a 5 - 10 minute walk to the bay, a little longer to reach pier 39. Would highly recommend Pats cafe for breakfast, just up the road slightly and to the left! Lots of Italian restaurants nearby. Cable car also just 5 minutes away. All in all would definately recommend this place, especially with the rates so low as they are.

I was still a little nervous though booking this hotel just because I wasn't sure what sort of condition the hotel would be in. I was looking for a place that was not too expensive yet still nice, in a good area, and clean. The hotel was all of that! The hotel is located in North Beach and maybe 2 or 3 blocks from Fisherman's wharf (you can walk there) and 1 block from the cable line (which will take you all the way down to Union square and other areas of the city) . There was also a Muni bus stop right in front of the hotel. The room we stayed in was large compared to other hotels in San Fran that I had stayed in. I was very relieved to see that the room and bathroom were extremely clean and well taken care of (I gross out easily if bathrooms are not clean). For $5 a day you can request a refrigerator (there is no microwave). We were on the 3rd floor facing Columbus avenue and our room was near a club called Bimbo's. If you are a light sleeper you may want to request a room on the other end of the hotel because you can hear music playing from the club at night (especially on Friday nights and the weekends). A huge bonus with this hotel is that there is free parking (very rare in this city)!! Some of the parking spaces can be a little tight to get into and the weekend we were there, a lot of the larger spaces were taken, but they do have two levels of parking. All of the front desk guys were nice and helpful whenever we had a question. There's a really good Indian restaurant across the street and a great place called Pat's Cafe a street over (the breakfast is yummy). I would stay at this hotel again.

At first glance, we were somewhat dubious as the external appearance of the hotel belies the interior. It is an older style typical motor inn, the lobby is on the street level and very small and one enters the elevator through the lobby virtually off the street. However, don't let appearances deceive you! We had previously booked a King room on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel, away from the ice machine, as suggested by a previous visitor and had no complaints whatsoever -- the room, although not luxurious, was larger than normal, very clean, and the halls were also very clean. It was particularly convenient that the bathroom sink was located outside the shower/toilet room which allowed both of us to get ready at the same time every day. Although the room looked out on a side street over a nightclub, we were never bothered by noise at night. Also, the price was extremely reasonable for San Francisco -- $122.00/night. The location is excellent for Fisherman's Wharf (about five blocks walking) and just around the corner is the end of the line for the Mason Powell cable car line which allowed us to travel all over where the cable cars run in the city -- there is a ticket booth right there too to buy visitors' passes which we strongly recommend -- we paid $18.00 each for a 3 day visitors pass allowing us unlimited travel on the cable cars, buses and subway (although we didn't use the subway) -- a great deal when you consider it costs $5.00 for a one way ride on the cable car! There is a #30 bus stop right outside the door also. There didn't seem to be many places to eat close by but that didn't bother us too much as we were usually out and about the city most days. The Inn does rent out small refrigerators for an additional $5.00 per day (which we took advantage of) so we were able to keep staples on hand for continental breakfasts in the mornings and snacks at night. Although we didn't have a car, there is free parking available at the Inn - a real bargain when you consider some hotels in SF charge $35.00 to $40.00/day!

The reviews seemed good as well. We have three children and most hotels do not allow 5 people per room. In addition everything in San Francisco tends to be expensive and you need to add parking on top of it. I called the hotel directly and booked a \"family suite\". It was $189 a night including parking. I honestly wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised. Noah checked us in. He was very helpful with any and all questions and the ones he was unsure of he hopped on the computer and found the answer for me. The elevator was out for our stay - but it was okay. We were on the first floor and the bell hop carried all of our bags to the room. They even delivered a roll away bed. We were shocked at how large the room was, especially for San Francisco standards. It had a large room with two double beds and a table and chairs. There was a second room with a door that had a queen bed and enough room for the roll-away. We had plenty of room to move about and bed times were very easy having a door to close. I was also impressed with the cleanliness. I always push the bed up against the wall since I have a little one sleeping in bed with me. Normally I am rather disgusted at what accumulates under the bed that rarely gets cleaned. This time - it was spotless - made me very happy. The decor is a bit dated, but it really reminds me of \"grandma's house\". The lights, the wallpaper, etc. reminds me of going into my grandmas dining room/living room area. The bathroom is nothing to write home about - but it had good water pressure and HOT water. The location was great. A very easy two block walk to the cable car stop on Taylor & Bay, bus stop right outside to catch the #30 to the Exploritorium and an easy walk to the Cannery, Fisherman's Wharf and not bad walk to Chinatown. Downside: Being right on Columbus the room was a bit noisy - especially if you are not used to city noise - but we all slept very well. Also the other employees who worked the front desk were nice enough, but not very knowledgeable of the city or public transit.

We requested a high floor room and were allocated Room 215 which faced Columbus Avenue and was located on the 2nd floor at the very end of a long corridor. At first I was apprehensive about having a room facing Columbus Avenue as I am a light sleeper and have read past reviews about the traffic noise but I was not kept awake by the street noises at all, however, as we were there from a Friday night to a Monday morning, the traffic noise may be different on a weekday. We found the Suite to be very clean and it was great to have individual air conditioning units in each room. When we woke each morning we put the air conditioners on and the rooms quickly heated up. (We found it a bit chilly in the mornings) Sure, the furniture is not ultra chic and of modern design, however there was plenty of drawers and wardrobes if you wanted to unpack. All the furniture was a dark timber, almost antique design and was not shabby at all. The queen bed was located in a seperate room from the two doubles which allowed privacy. The bathroom was clean and free of mould etc with the shower located over the bath and toilet located in same room. The water pressure of the showe was fantastic and we did not find the shower head too low at all as previously reported and husband is 6' 2'' tall. It was good to have a large vanity and basin located just outside the bathroom with a hairdryer. There is a very large ice machine on each floor located next to the elevators. It might be wise to not get a room near this area as the ice machine was really really noisy all the time. It seemed to be constantly churning over the ice and sounded like it was about to take off into orbit it was so noisy !! We did go to Pat's Cafe once for breakfast which is located in a nearby side street but we found the menu very limited and a bit expensive. We then discovered a Cafe on Columbus Ave, heading 3 blocks towards Fishermans Wharf & across the road from The Holiday Inn. The Diner/Cafe (sorry can't remember the name) had alot more variety with very good prices and with alot locals dining there also. Located next to the Diner was an Internet Coffee Shop, we used the internet here to pre-checkin for our flight on Southwest Airlines and they also printed the Boarding passes for 50cents per page. The Columbus Inn was a fantastic find in a great location for a truely great price and we easily walked to Fishermans Wharf, Lombard Street and to the Pier which the ferry for Alcatraz tours leaves from and we caught the bus which leaves outside the hotel to Union Square and then caught the Cable Car back. I had originally booked a hotel in Union Square but then changed my mind and booked the Columbus Motor Inn mainly for the great price and for the additional bedroom and I was so glad that we didn't stay at Union Square as my husband and 2 teenage sons were not at all interested at shopping at all so I was glad we settled for a hotel that was close to Fishermans Wharf and the attractions that are in that area,. When I pointed out to them the hotel that I had originally booked at Union Square they were all so relieved that I made the accommodation change to the Columbus and so was I. We also could not fault the professionalism of the Front Desk staff who were always ready to provide information and maps of the area. We also arrived 3 hours earlier than check-in time and our room was ready which was really nice after a long 13 hour flight from Australia. Our stay at the Columbus Motor Inn was made purely from reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not dissapointed at all. We would stay here again without hesitation.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redondo Beach, Calif.", "Title": "\u201cGreat find!\u201d", "Author": "LaSerena", "ReviewID": "UR7381460", "Content": "We decided to make San Fran a last minute stop on our road trip so I booked this hotel at 4pm on a Friday for that evening.

Since parking near Fisherman's Wharf costs $2 every 20 minutes (with max of $30 dollars a day), free parking is amazing. Also, most of the other hotels in the area were asking $200 or above for their rooms. This motel is on a very busy street but we had a back room on the third floor (306) which was very quiet. We could see the Transamerica building and Coit Tower from our window. Our room was clean and well maintained (in fact, the rooms are better than expected compared to the outside of the hotel).

Since we had never been to SF before, I first had to decide what neighborhood, which I did by reading books and going to various websites. North Beach sounded fantastic, so then I struggled with whether to pay more to be *right in* North Beach or pay much less to stay at the Columbus Motor Inn *near* North Beach. I finally settled on the Columbus, and I am very happy I did. Not only did we pay less than half what we would have elsewhere, but the hotel was perfectly located, in between NB and Fisherman's Wharf, with a bus stop right out front, a nice big, comfortable, clean room with free internet (both wireless and plug-in), and our room had a balcony with a view of both Coit Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid. Initially I had requested a back room, away from the side of the hotel which is nearest Bimbo's club, thinking it would be quieter. When we got there no such room was available, but we were told we could ask for a different room in the morning. By then, though, we had decided our fears of noise had been groundless and we loved our room and didn't want to move. The room was huge, with a well-stocked coffee maker (the coffee wasn't half bad for what it was), a separate sink area and bathroom with tub shower. I loved standing on the balcony in the morning to check the weather and watch everyone walking down the street. I felt like the neighborhood was perfectly safe and pleasant to walk in, and often walked to and from North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf, including at night (I am a 30-something female). Although I am used to urban areas, having lived in both NYC and DC, I don't think anyone would have a problem with this neighborhood. As I mentioned, Bimbo's club is next door, but despite its name it's a pretty upscale club (go to their website and you'll see what I mean). One night there was actually some kind of benefit concer there, and elegantly gowned and tuxedoed people were emerging from Mercedeses and limos. The desk staff were always friendly, and were happy to let us leave our stuff there all day on our last day (we were catching the red-eye flight that night). Book through their website, and you'll get the best prices. My advice would be to stay here, get a MUNI passport when you first arrive (ours were $24 each for 7 days and covered bus, streetcar and cable car, allowing us to hop on and off at will), and have a wonderful time in San Francisco. I sure did, and I am equally sure that if and when we make it back to \"the city,\" we will stay here again.", "Date": "April 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Marino, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat find!\u201d", "Author": "Kidsandpets", "ReviewID": "UR7301516", "Content": "Last week I travelled to SF with my 10 year old son and had reservations at Columbus, having found it on the internet. Friends had warned that Columbus Ave might be dirty and noisy but based on the reviews on trip advisor.com, I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did! This hotel really is a find. It is very clean, the beds are excellent quality (very important to me), there is free wireless connection in the room (great if you can take your laptop with you to check things out during your visit) and our room was very quiet. I can't verify that all the rooms are equally quiet because it is a busy street but I was never conscious of it being very noisy even in the lobby. We requested a third floor, back room and got it. The lobby is situated so they have very controlled access to the rooms and I never felt unsafe--at the hotel or on Columbus Ave. This may not be of interest to many but to my son, the most important hotel criteria is that it have cable tv (we don't have it at home) and this hotel did have it. And of course the free car park is a wonderful benefit if you drove, as we did. In addition to it being a clean, safe and quiet, it is located superbly well for sightseeing. We could easily walk to the Wharf, North Beach restaurants, and even Chinatown. We took the Hyde Street cable car (go early in the morning like 9'ish to avoid the long lines) up Russian Hill and walked down Lombard right back to the hotel. We had our car with us and drove to the Golden Gate and Muir Woods--an easy drive from this hotel's location. Although there was not any printed materials in the room listing nearby restaurants, shops, etc., the staff at the front desk were helpful and friendly with all our questions concerning restaurants, directions, bus rides (great bus stops right outside hotel) and provided helpful maps. My only advice/caution would be that we felt the breakfast choices were a little limited. One day we went up to Mama's Cafe on Washington Square (it opens at 8 and we got there at 7:50 and were fifth in line) and were disappointed in it. The long lines don't allow for a leisurely breakfast and while the food was certainly good, I wasn't up for paying almost $30 for breakfast for the two of us every day. We did a bit better at Pat's Cafe which is just across the street virtually from the Columbus--slightly better prices, similar food though a bit more limited in choices and not terribly efficient service but very friendly and neighborhood-y. However, next time, I would definitely take up the Columbus on their offer to put a fridge in our room for $5/day and then go down the street two blocks and get Trader Joe's and Starbuck's items for breakfast in the room. I should add Italian pastries to that as we also found some really delish pastries a few blocks up on Columbus. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The only down side is that there is no room service and the only reason that mattered was that my son had a 24 hour tummy bug the first 24 hours and I was having to drag him with me so that I could get something to eat.

I used their website to check for availability and price, but I chose to call and make reservations rather than use their online booking system. I did not use their website because it was not a secure site, and I was not about to provide credit card information online without some security. When I asked the person behind the desk about this he replied that that is an online \"only\" price. I informed him that it did not say that these were online \"only prices on their website. I also didn't like that they \"recycle\" their towels. They ask if you will use your towels more than once in order to cut down on laundry, and when you need a new one put the old one on the floor. I did this one day and it seems like they picked up my towel and hung it on the rack. Not a big deal, but could be a problem if you expect fresh towels daily. Long story short: This was a nice stay in a comfortable hotel with a great location, but the price is subject to change based on what they decide. If you decide to stay here get your price in writing or stay someplace else!

Sure, you can stay in other hotels with restaurants and pools but why would you want to swim when there are so many things to see in the city and there are literally thousands of restaurants too??", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cColumbus Motor Inn is great find!\u201d", "Author": "NLFlower", "ReviewID": "UR5713671", "Content": "We stayed for two nights at the Columbus Motor Inn and were very pleased that we chose this place. It is an older hotel, with no public rooms or restaurants, except for a small lobby. But if you are looking for a reasonably priced clean, comfortable room, with a convenient location, and free parking, I don't think you could top this place. Although the room decor was not exciting, it was pleasant and in good condition. It was also spacious -- there were three of us and we had plenty of room for all of our things. The tub/shower was in a separate room from the sink and vanity. We had two double beds, a large dresser, and a small table and chairs. From our large windows, we could look down on a street view, or look in the distance and see Coit Tower in one direction and San Francisco Bay in the other direction. It has a perfect location for site-seeing. From the hotel we walked to Fisherman's Wharf (about 4 blocks), Chinatown (about 8 blocks), the crooked part of Lombard Street (4 blocks), and Union Square (about 10 blocks). The front desk staff was extremely helpful -- an older gentleman in the evening who actually walked out to our car at the curb to give us parking directions, and a young gentleman during the day who gave us excellent restaurant recommendations. Both were as friendly and helpful as could be. When planning our trip, I was determined not to waste money by paying extremely high prices for lodging and parking. This hotel met our needs perfectly. My husband was very impressed with me for finding this place!

The Route 30 bus stops at the hotel, and the Powell-Mason cable car turnaround is two short blocks away.

We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel near Fisherman's Wharf so we could have easy access to all the attractions families with teenagers would enjoy. We found the Columbus Motor Inn on tripadvisor and followed the recommendations here. We are very glad we did! The main thing Columbus Motor Inn has going for it is LOCATION! It is absolutely perfectly centered for everything we wanted to do as a family. It is 1 1/2 blocks from the Powell-Mason St. cable car terminus, making grabbing a cable car uptown to Union Square or Chinatown a breeze. Bus #30 stops right in front of the hotel and it takes you from the Palace of Fine Arts one one end to SBC Park on the other. We were within easy walking distance of Fisherman'w Wharf, Pier 39, Alcatraz and the tourist shops. Within a few blocks are great Italian restaurants and Pat's Cafe around the corner makes a great omellette. We parked the car in the FREE parking garage attached to the hotel. We bought a 3 day MUNI pass and used public transportation to go where ever we wanted. We had a standard 2 double bed room on the third floor that was quite spacious. It was clean, well maintained and there were fresh fluffy towels each day. From the bay window we could see Alcatraz, Coit Tower, and the TransAmerica building. Wow! The room didn't have any \"extra\" perks- refrigerator, microwave, guest laundry or continental breakfast, but the location made up for it. The staff was very helpful setting up city tours, recommending eating places, and giving travel directions. This is a great economical hotel at the heart of where we wanted to be in San Francisco.

In fact we only used it once to take us to the Golden Gate Bridge for the traditional walk across the bridge and loosely following the 49 Mile Scenic Drive. Our room was very, very clean and large with two Queen-sized beds, a sofa, which is always a bonus. We had a nice view of the SF skyline from our room. Excellent value for the money and would absolutely stay there again. The Columbus Motor Inn doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a pool but for us this was more than compensated with their free parking. The Inn also provides free High Speed internet access (wired and wireless); just bring your own laptop.
