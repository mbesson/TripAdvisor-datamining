A couple of aspects that need further comment are: 1. We arrived at the same time as a group of around 40 Germans, most of whom did not appear to have stayed in a hotel before, and instead of moving these guys to a separate area to avoid a complete obstruction of check-in pandemonium reigned supreme for a period of time. 2.

When we arrived we were checked in immediately because our rood was ready. The staff here is exeptional, very helpful, friendly and courteous (something we did not always find in Sydney). We had done too much shopping so we decided to ship some of it back on the last day via FedEx (it was the christmas holiday so all the Australian Post offices were closed for an extended period of time). We filled all the paperwork, packed out items and left them in the capable hands of the concierge, who arranged for the pickup after we left and we received them at home a couple of days after our arrival. One night we took out two bottles of beer out of the fridge minibar and placed them in the other non refrigerated section of the minibar in order to have room for our bottle of water for the next day. Next evening we noticed the beers were entirely gone from the room and did not think anything of it. Upon checkout there was a hefty charge for two beers, so we explained what happened and the charges were taken out. We ordered room service one very late night, which was speedy and fairly tasty. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel. You had a choice of a-la-carte, continental breakfast or the full buffet breakfast. We switched back and forth between the three choices on different mornings. The staff here was touch and go. Some mornings they were super friendly and efficient, and other mornings a different shift was rude, slow and made mistakes. One particular morning we waited about 40 minutes for our sunny side up eggs, and when they came the toast was cold and basically not even toasted. we asked then to toast it again, and with a roll of the eye they took it away and brough it back 5 minutes later a little more brown.

Two hours later I got a call to apologize about them having mislaid my luggage.

I asked if they now took cash the lady at the front desk said we take cash or eftpos which doesn't have a charge, I was furious because no one had told me about the extra charge or that you could use eftpos. To top it off today I get a letter charging me extra for minibar use, I did not use anything from the minibar except for tea bags.

We booked our accommodation on the hotel's website. At the time of our booking, they had a special offer for room upgrades. The offer was only available on the day of check-in and based upon availability. As part of the condition when you apply for the upgrade of the day, you must take (and pay for) the upgrade if you are offered an upgrade upon check-in. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a Premier Room for an additional AU$12/night, which was a bargain! I thought this was a great marketing tool and of course it encouraged me to spend a little more on the hotel room. As most of the reviews say, the hotel staff are very welcoming and friendly. The concierge staff are ready to assist with any information you may need. The free WiFi was a bonus as my husband needed to work for a few hours during our stay. Not many Sydney hotels offer free WiFi, which I think is a shame in this day and age. I used the hotel gym, which was adequate, but quite small. The 1st morning I used the gym, there were 3 others in the gym at the same time, which made it quite crammed and a little uncomfortable. The next day, I went for a run outside, which was beautiful as I could easily run down to the Opera House and along the waterfront of the Botanical Gardens. I never tire of the scenery! The hotel's location was superb for us. It is mid way between the main shopping area of Pitt Street Mall (Westfields, Myers, David Jones) and Circular Quay. It was easy to shop up a storm, then return to the hotel when my feet ached or my fingers were numb from holding the shopping bags - whichever came first! The hotel's facade is a lovely old building and just like the photos. The hotel has managed to keep the old windows in tact whilst installing modern (sound proof) ones inside, so that the hotel doesn't loose it's old look or charm. The Christmas decorations in the hotel were tasteful and not over-the-top. Our room was clean and the bathroom was spacious with a separate shower and bath. The room decor was thoughtfully planned and in calming neutral tones. The bed was very comfortable as was the comforter and pillows. My only complaint was that the housekeeping service was not consistant. The 1st night we were given a turn down service with a breakfast menu on the pillow and water beside the bed. The following evening, we didn't. On the 2nd day of our stay when our room was serviced, our bathroom amenities were not replenished. Upon check in we were asked if we'd like a newspaper. The 1st morning it was delivered, the 2nd morning it wasn't. I know they're not major issues, just a little inconsistancy.

I chose it mostly for the location, and was pleased with the quick 10 minute stroll down Pitt Street to the waterfront--other sights, even the Australian Museum, weren't more than a 20 minute walk. The hotel itself is typical businessman's five star; newspaper delivered to your hotel door each morning, attentive porters and concierge staff; and best of all, free wi-fi internet. This last item alone tipped me on the Radisson Blu--surely at the prices in this category, a gouge for another $15 or so isn't necessary. Truly bothers me about the higher-end hotels. The hotel is housed in a glorious heritage building, which I was told used to be the home of a Sydney newspaper and another prominent operation a century ago. Exceptionally well restored, with high ceilings and period architecture kept intact. The gym and pool were quite small, but well maintained. I also liked the swipe card security system in the elevators and into the gym area--a comforting thought during high crowds downton on a Friday or Saturday night. My only complaint would be the rather average food in the dining room. I had a dinner, lunch and two breakfasts, but finally gave up after paying double the price for half the quality of food I could find just a block or two away. The meteoric rise in the Australian dollar over the past three years has put prices in Sydney into sticker shock category for North Americans(the latest world city index ranks it 30% higher than New York City) so I automatically assumed that a $30 plate of bacon and eggs wouldn't be swimming in grease) Gauging by comments from other travellers who had stayed in nearby five star hotels, I believe the Blu warrants its high ratings.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, well appointed rooms.\u201d", "Author": "kepsimax", "ReviewID": "UR123090777", "Content": "The hotel is in a great location, approximately halfway between Circular Quay and the Pitt St Mall, 50m from Wynyard Train Station and a few streets from the M5 / Eastern Distributor. Given the strange shape of the building (think the Flatiron Building in NYC), the rooms vary in size and layout. My room (222) was easily the largest, by at least an extra 5-6 square metres, albeit without views onto George or O'Connell Streets. The marbled bathroom was enormous, and included a separate spa tub and walk in rainshower (fantastic pressure). An iron & board were included in the wardrobe, which was handy, as well as a large desk and mini lounge next to the window. The large kingsize bed was a bit too soft for my liking, however Radisson offers a pillow menu (foam, feather etc) which was novel. Aircon is individually controlled - some fellow guests of mine failed to realise this - within the room. The TV featured an adequate selection of local and overseas TV channels, including all 3 Fox Sports (Australia). Minibar was provided, although the prices were horrific - $7.50 for a 1.5L bottle of drinking water, $8 for local beers etc. I suggest doing what we did, and deposit the contents into the drawers provided and restock with your own goodies from the minimart across the street. Note also the hotel bar is ridiculously expensive - for a drink I suggest going straight across the road to the Bavarian Beer Cafe. We did not eat in the reknowned Bilson's restaurant located within the hotel. I didn't get a chance to use the gym / pool / sauna but was informed by fellow travellers that it was certainly adequate. Overall a very nice hotel that I will certainly return to next time in Sydney - I would like to see their check in and concierge streamlined, as it was borderline chaotic when we arrived at around 11am on a Monday morning. I've never had to wait to check in to a hotel before, and after 20 minutes my patience was running thin.

When we arrived early in the morning on Boxing Day, they were extremely accommodating. They took our bags and held them for us until we could check in. We wanted to go to the zoo while we waited for check in and by the time we got back our bags were already in our room. The circular quay was just a short walk to catch our ferry to the zoo. Side note, the Taronga Zoo was amazing. It was by and far one of my favorite zoos I have ever been to which is saying a lot since I am from San Diego. When we returned we relaxed by taking a nice bath and a hot shower. The shower head felt like it was massaging you. That night, we were tired, but still wanted to go out for some local fare. The concierge recommended Jamie's Italian, which was only a block away. It was by and far some of the best food we have ever had. Everything was very fresh and delicious. The french fries (aka chips) were heavenly. They had the perfect texture of crunch on the outside with a soft warm inside that was only made better by the special mayo that was served with it. That night we slept fitfully in our comfortable beds. The next day we took a short walk to The Rocks, which is a must see. The shopping and art gallery area had lots of little eateries. We enjoyed some amazing lemon meringue pie at the Rocks Cafe. We then took a short cab ride to Bondi beach ($25.00 cab ride) and enjoyed a leisurely stroll from Bondi to Tamarama Beach which was a lovely picturesque walk. Finally, we finished our second day in Sydney by going to a bar and restaurant below the Sydney Opera house, again just a short walk away, and enjoyed an delightful meal while overlooking the bridge and listening to a live outdoor band.

There was a little noise from other rooms but nothing much. The cleaning staff, as others have said, did park outside as if waiting for you to leave so they could come in. They even knocked at 9am despite the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. The best thing about Radisson Blu is the atmosphere, friendly and yet professional and this is due to the wonderful staff. The breakfast is amazing, down to asking for your choice of how the coffee is served and omelet rather than the standard fare. The bar is relaxing and staff are really good (expensive drinks and food but good quality and quantity). I think your room comfort depends on what room you are allocated or have booked. We have had a wonderful experience on both stays. We even tried for Radisson Blu on a last minute website secret deal two months ago and got Sofitel instead which we didn't enjoy anywhere near as much.

We had a room with 2 Double Beds and paid $808 taxes all in, for 3 nights. The building exterior is beautiful. I believe it is heritage listed and the unusual shape and sandstone is quite lovely. On the other hand, the reception area has that bland \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchain hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feel to it. I was a little disappointed on first entering, but that soon changed... The main room in our suite was large, even with the two beds, although they were set fairly close together. There was a sitting area with small table and 2 chairs, a large desk and office chair, a flat screen TV, small fridge and the usual bedside tables and lamps. There were plenty of drawers and hanging space \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even almost enough hangers! The beds were only doubles, which feels small these days even when sleeping alone. However they were extremely comfortable, with the most beautiful bedding. In fact, my friend took the pillows apart trying to find a label so she could get the same ones for home. The bathroom was large with a separate (deep) bath and shower. There was plenty of shelf space, even for the cosmetics of two females. The water pressure was strong and the shower fantastic. We could probably have done with an extra couple of hooks in the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I find that to be the case is every hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at (why is that?!) As others have said, we found the location to be handy to shopping/Pitt Street Mall, Circular Quay, Sydney Opera House etc. Central and fairly easy to get around once we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d located ourselves.

After reading the recent reviews, I think we should have availed ourselves of the Concierge! Aside from that, I would say that the Radisson/Blu/Plaza or whatever they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re calling it now, was an excellent experience.

We had the 'do not disturb' sign on the door yet the cleaning staff decided to park the trolley literally right outside our door for 40 minutes and talked really loudly the whole time. This was common most mornings during our 6 night stay. The room itself was good however the bed is so close to the bathroom that if you leave the bathroom sliding door open and are sleeping on the left side of the bed you are staring at the awfully close toilet (see photos - room 115). Also the bathroom door is glass so if you want to sleep while your partner is in the bathroom you have no chance as the light is glaring through. Overall the hotel is one of the noisiest we have stayed in. The doors are really heavy and slam all day and all night however they don't seem to block out the noise in the hallways. You hear lots of noise, banging and talking from the adjoining rooms and above. In fact the walls are so thin that every time the person next door uses the wardrobe and closes the doors or drawers the loud bang wakes you up and the wall shakes.

The business class rooms are comfortably appointed, but again, nothing spectacular compared to other hotels in its class. The bathroom is nice, clean and has a large soaker tub as well as a shower stall. Everything was spotlessly clean each day, and turn down service is prompt. The business class rooms also provide access to the gold lounge, which provides a delicious morning breakfast, snacks during the afternoon and evening and cocktails in the evening. The room is nice and the staff is fantastic. Sheila offered lots of recommendations on where to go for dinner, another lady from Bali (i believe she was the lounge manager, and I am sorry I can't remember her name) was very friendly and always made an attempt to engage me in conversation. She also made recommendations on where to go. The man that worked during breakfast was nothing but professional, and never said no to any special request. All in all, this is an amazing hotel, truly worth the stay. My only complaints are small: 1) What is with the excessively starched sheets? They were not uncomfortable, but took some time getting used to. 2) The prices for room service are out to lunch. I know its a 5 star hotel, but no hamburger is worth $30 ($25 for the burger plus a $5 delivery fee).

It's located on a slightly smaller street than some of the big main streets in the CBD, and so there's less traffic noise. Rooms are double glazed, and so it's possible to get a fantastic night's sleep, also aided by the extremely comfortable mattresses and pillows. I had a lovely time at this hotel: staff are friendly and helpful, room service is excellent, facilities are terrific (swimming pool, spa, gym), it's great for business travel too (free wifi and free wired internet - much appreciated, there's nothing I dislike more than hotels charging fees for wifi!). My room was also extremely spacious: high ceilings, lots of storage and floor space. The bathroom is large, with a fabulous bath and separate shower. There's a clever design that uses shutters to allow natural light into the bathroom too. My one criticism would be that breakfast is expensive: you should factor it in to the overall cost of your stay. The buffet breakfast (which is excellent) is expensive: $35 per person. Room service breakfast is also quite expensive: even if you only want tea, juice and cereal, you will end up paying around $25.

I don't usually like older buildings and older style but this hotel makes it work with old style look (amazing desk in business class rooms) along with up to the minute bathroom style and fittings. Reception area, huge lounge and bar and Bistro Fax are modern and very well presented. Service was top class, I can't fault it - from the Concierge with helpful hints of how to get to places despite us knowing Sydney quite well, suggestions to take an umbrella in the evening, help with bags and genuine interest in us; through to the Chef and Staff at breakfast in Bistro Fax. I ordered omelet two mornings and they were prepared within minutes and delicious. I even swapped the pot of coffee for a latte (no problem at all). All the food was well presented and very yummy! Bar service in afternoons was excellent and the burgers (both chicken and beef special) were very filling with chips also. Check-in was so fast I can't even remember it. Check-out was by speedy card (I'd checked and preapproved the final costs via the TV link). Pool, spa, steam-room were very much appreciated after a long day of shopping and walking about Sydney and Darling Harbour. My husband said it was the clearest, cleanest pool he has used in a hotel. The gym looked good and will be used on a future stay. Like a previous reviewer I'd like to keep this all a secret but I can't so I will instead ask management to ensure these high standards remain - we have stayed in other good hotels and sadly seen the standards drop when staff become lax. Radisson Blu has very good staff - they are what make your business so good. I forgot to mention the cleaning staff - very friendly greetings and again, a very high standard.

Another great plus is the free internet, that definitely earns points for me. A couple of points to note on the rooms, the do not disturb sign is not wired, the hotel still uses the old fashioned cardboard on the door handle. What this means is that the door bell does not get disabled and I got a very rude wake up at 3:30am one night. I'm not sure who the person was but the door bell rang twice and stopped, so I'm assuming it was a prank or a mistake. House keeping was only so-so. Example: the work desk in the room has a piece of glass over it, between the glass and the desk surface were crumbs left over from a previous guest and the crumbs remained there for my entire stay. All they needed to do was stick the vacuum hose on it for 2 seconds. Room service was good and prompt, food was hot and VERY reasonably priced for Sydney. Breakfast at the restaurant was okay.

Was a great base to explore the various city sights, 2 minute walk to both Circular Quay and Martin Place.

No shortage of restaurants in the vicinity both Asian and Western, and award-winning Bilson's is of course right in the ground floor of the hotel. The room I had was small-ish, but well appointed, with comfortable bed, a pillow menu, a small work desk, and a comfy bathroom. Only gripe was that I could find neither a toothbrush nor a comb but these were promptly brought when I rang housekeeping. The shower area also didn't have a light directly above it, which made it darker than I am typically used to. Wardrobe was awfully tiny and in dire need of an upgrade.

I will stay here again and again. I brought my Sydney-sider friends to see my room and they were equally impressed, noting the rooms are larger than you find elsewhere in the city. I chose the business deal which was only like $13 more expensive than standard. This provided breakfast, access to drinks/aperitif in business lounge, and other little amenities in the room. I took advantage of breakfast a couple times but not drinks, as I went out with friends. The bathroom is large with separate shower and bath, and I liked the idea of space and openness that the window from the bath provided. The view is of other buildings, but to be expected in the middle of the city. The bed is PERFECTLY firm, not too soft, not too hard (I'm Goldilocks) The TV is large and the interface for channels is quick and responsive. Unlike some lesser and annoying systems. The hotel is in the Central Business District, but so near to the new Westfield Mall (Excellent food court, unlike most malls, worth a visit), movie theatre and high-end boutiques off George, and so close to buses that go out to wherever you need to go, and 10 minutes from the Opera House and the Rocks and Circular Quay for ferries. (and the Museum of Sydney, a great place to go learn about the city and see great exhibitions). I find the Australian star system to be a bit inflated compared to the US system, for example a 5 star here is like a 4 star in the US. But all things considered, for this property, given the quality to price ratio, it is great value for the money, and I didn't find any details in the room to be overlooked or features to be run down or lacking. It is well maintained. The only bad thing was the 2% fee for using a credit card. Apparently hotels in Australia pass this expense on to the client overtly instead of just working it into their price structure as they should. Some charge 1.5% some charge 3.5%. The sign at the front desk says if you have questions you can ask the Manager, so I did, and he was quite flippant in pointing out that the Radisson's rate is less than the Westin's rate (where he used to work), and since I wasn't staying a month, it shouldn't be an imposition. The hotel I stayed in in another Australian city charged 1.5% but waived it.

Three oddities about the room: the shower door did not quite close properly, which resulted in a wet floor (not a huge deal), the vanity basin tap fittings were very visible under the vanity top (not a big deal in any functional way, but it detracted from the overall appearance of quality), and the blinds on the window were see-through.

USD 210 per room and night - breakfast included. The extension for one night at the rack rate of AUD 310 per room made the value for money we got for that Monday night accordingly less attractive, especially since it did not even include breakfast. Considering that the buffet costs AUD 35 per head, the equivalent package was hence more than double of what we paid during the first 3 days. We had breakfast, tea/drinks and dinner at and room-service from the hotel's brasserie/cafe restaurant. The breakfast spread was okay and the food quality also - but nothing to rave about (especially the bread/bakery section was on average underwhelming in quality, also the spread of fruits was boring and the savory hot food section lacked choices for vegetarians). I would not pay AUD 35 per head for it again - especially not for someone who has dietary restrictions (e.g. vegetarian). Dinner was fine in terms of quality and presentation but - if you are not yet used to how expensive Australia in general has become - it may be rather pricey. The staff was generally competent but in terms of friendliness and helpfulness we experienced the full range from excellent to quite poor.

As a result, it was nearly impossible to sit up in bed to read or watch TV (with back resting on the wall) or to engage in any more \"bed activities\" without pushing the bed away from the wall and creating a huge space between the bed and wall. It was pretty annoying. On another note, here's a tip - either bring your own adapter or ask the front desk to borrow theirs. They will try to sell you one for $20 or so (it's in the bar area in the room), but they have one they can loan you for free! Don't let them fool you. Overall, a nice stay at a nice hotel.

Our check-in was swift and efficiently done. The receptionist was very cheerful and obliging with providing information. The Concierge was also most helpful in providing a free map and directions. The entrance and lobby area is not as grand as one might expect, probably due to the constraints\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the existing structure of a restored heritage-listed building dating back to the 1800\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Our luggage did not take long to arrive in the room. This was followed some minutes later by a staff from housekeeping to check the in-room fridge/bar, to ensure that the stock was complete or we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be charged for what the previous guest might have consumed. I asked about the provision of complimentary bottles of drinking water as the 1.5 liter bottle provided in the room had a $7 tag on it. He immediately said that he could provide us with a complimentary small bottle of drinking water and this came within minutes after he left. Impressive! The room has been refurbished, and everything from carpet to upholstery looked clean. The bed is made up everyday and should you want to them to change the bed linen, you need to place a card on the bed to indicate this. This is their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 effort to conserve the environment. Another feature not usually seen in many hotels, is the option to request for pillows (ranging from Boomerang, Contour Foam, Feather or Down, Micro-fibre or Latex Rubber), so that with your preferred pillow, you may sleep a little longer in comfort! The mattress is comfortable, although on the soft side. I rate the sleep quality as 4 plus. Not five as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still noise heard either from the road below, or through the thin walls? I can hear if the occupant next door turns on the water tap or whenever the toilet is flushed! The room has a small balcony but the view is not fantastic. A Travel adapter plug is provided and Internet access is free, as it should be these days in any good hotel. The toilet is rather small but this did not hamper movements. There were sufficient towels and the usual amenities like a hair drier, lighted mirror, bathroom scales, etc. provided. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bathtub and a separate glass enclosed, shower area. A window over the bathtub opens to reveal the bedroom so the entire suite has the appearance of looking bigger. As the room itself is not large, there is no proper table for boiling water, and space for making tea or coffee. This is done either at the table where the flat screen TV is positioned, or on the writing table. The air conditioner has a good thermostat and the temperature can be set to your desired level easily and effectively. The best thing about this property is without doubt its location, which is midway between Circular Quay and the Queen Victoria Building on Pitt Street. Depending on how fast you can walk, it takes between 7 to 10 minutes to get to either destination. Once in the vicinity of the QVB it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no problem to get on to the monorail to Chinatown, Paddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market, Darling Harbour, etc. And at the other end of Pitt Street, to Circular Quay and a short walk further to the Rocks, the Sydney Opera House, Royal Botanic Gardens, etc. Tip: Get to George Street by crossing through Hunter Street outside the Hotel, and catch the FREE shuttle bus no:555 that runs around in a loop within the CBD every ten minutes! The Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel besides having good food, a nice bar, and other facilities like their swimming pool, gym, business centre, health club, etc. also has close by, many ATMs, Banks, convenience stores, small cafes, restaurants and bars around the area.

Most international flights land in Sydney early morning and it was an amazing crowd in the reception all waiting for the rooms to free-up (including the flight crew).

I loved every minute of my stay there. I would have liked a room with a view other than that of the internal structure of the building complex, but I guess I could also have chosen to upgrade if I was really desperate for a view. There was no waiting around for my room to be organised. It was ready upon arrival. Loved that the porter brought up my bags. It's the small things that really make you feel special. Food is a big thing for me, and the in-room dining menu was fabulous here. Of course, there are many restaurants around Sydney if you so choose to go out and dine, and the hotel does have a top restaurant. However, the hotel is a short walk from Circular Quay, so I'd recommend checking out any of the restaurants and caf\u00c3\u00a9s that are located there. Loved that the room was clean. You hear lots of horror stories about hotel rooms that, despite the 4 or 5 star rating of the hotel, are unacceptably dirty. No problems here though. My room was spotless, and housekeeping kept it that way for the week that I stayed. And one of the best parts of my stay, was that it is a smoke free hotel! The staff are polite and helpful, and there was no hint of condescension from any of them. They gave the impression that they genuinely were happy that I'd chosen to stay at the Radisson Plaza. I was certainly happy that I'd chosen to stay there. Again, for a 5 star hotel, it was lovely to see all manner of guests, from business people, to families, to couples, and solo travellers, and a great age range of patrons as well. The location of the hotel is perfect, with Circular Quay a short walk away, Pitt Street Mall is even closer, and for a longer walk, Darling Harbour isn't too far away. I absolutely LOVED staying here, and I highly recommend it to anyone . . . to be honest, I'd be quite happy to permanently reside at the Radisson Plaza in Sydney.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sandie002", "ReviewID": "UR105708903", "Content": "Loved this hotel.

So i immediately rang reception and told them and it was apologies and i wouldnt be charged for this, Upon hanging up, I looked at the contents of the glass and the bottle and there was bits of food at the bottom of the bottle and some in my glass.

Being advertised as a boutique, 5 star hotel, we thought we would treat ourselves to a bit of luxury and a room with a view. We paid a little bit extra for it but thought it would be well worth the money. How we were wrong. Reception kindly allocated us the wrong room. How disappointed we were to open the doors into a dark and shifty room, only a few floors up and with one small window overlooking the hotel wall. No natural light whatsoever or the 'premier view'. We went down to reception immediately to ask them to check our booking and were hastily told 'you get you pay for'. An upgrade would incur a further 100 pounds a night. We resigned ourselves to the fact that Australian hotels were rubbish. It wasn't until halfway through our stay that my husband had the foresight to double check the hotel literature and realised we HAD been allocated the wrong room. We were finally moved to the correct room on the Saturday night, a great time to have to pack up your belongings and shift. Breakfast was offered by way of compensation but with only a few days left and two early starts, this was a feeble apology and one of which we could barely partake. No financial compensation foer the money we had missed out on by being allocated the wrong and chearper room. To add insult to injury, the housekeeping is sporadic, the complimentary water and newspaper appears when it feels like it, food orders are inaccurate and expect someone else's bill to be delivered to your room. All in all, a truly 5 star experience. This is the last time I will be staying at a Radisson.

I travel to Sydney regularly and appricate that if you stay in a cheap hotel that you will recieve bad service, that is why I pay the $400+ per night at the radisson. On my last trip, I booked a car through the concierge (Victor?) for an airport pick up. It didn't arrive, so I called the hotel who said that no car had been booked and that if I wanted one I would have to wait 2 hours. No thanks, plenty of other limo companys at the airport. When I got to the Hotel, the concierge (short, lebanese man) yelled at me and said if I didn't want a car I shouldn't have booked one. He said he would charge me anyway. Having arrived at 11am, I was not expecting a room to be ready for me so I asked to leave my bags at the hotel until I could check in at 2pm. I went to the hotel resturant bistro-fax for lunch with a client and was interupted by the hotel \"something-or-other\" manager Bernie. I have met him before but he introduces himself everytime he is on. Kinda cute watching him pretend we are old friends but not while I'm with a client. He has all the grace on a train wreck. I came back to the reception desk at 1:45pm and was told by a skinny white russian kid that my room now won't be ready till about 4 or 5pm. Great. I asked if I could get something out of my bags, to which I was told that they had already been delivered to my room?? By the time they were found, about (30 minutes) the concierge had come over to gloat that he had indeed charged me for the hire car that didn't turn up and yelled something about how having golden keys made him some sort of demi-god. With that in mind, when my bags were found, I put them in a cab, took them round the corner to the intercontinental and checked in ($120 per night cheaper!) They even gave me a harbour view room! Much better than looking at a 1970's bank from the radisson. I only needed to wait 15 minutes for a room there, and there limo company turns up on time. I used to like the Radisson, but has fallen in service, risen in cost and is now a dissapointment.

I've stayed here a few times. Having moved out of Sydney for work, i love indulging whenever i get back home, by staying in a CBD hotel. I've stayed at a few different hotels this year, however this piece of heaven is my favourite place to rest and unwind in Sydney! Perfection from beginning to end - always an easy and quick check in. The valet staff are so polite, as are the check in staff and housekeeping. The staff here are so genuinely nice - i know people get paid to be pleasant, particularly in customer service type industries, but the staff at the Radisson always come across as happy in their jobs and very lovely people. I've stayed in other Sydney hotels where you barely get a smile. That is why i always rave about this hotel to friends and work colleagues (we all travel a lot, so i always recommend the Radisson Plaza Sydney for a 100% fantastic stay!). Enough of the gushing - to practicalities. The rooms are always so immaculate, and the decor very pleasant. The beds are like beds for a princess (or prince) - so high and comfy - being an occasional insomniac, i always fall straight to sleep without waking during the night. On my recent stay, as previously, there weren't any problems with noise from outside. The room service menu is by FAR the best of any hotel! I highly recommend the spaghetti wagyu beef bolognaise as a late night treat - the best pasta meal ever, I always doze comfortably off to sleep every time. The hotel offers so many services such as internet, newspaper delivery in the morning, in room massage (divine!), access to your account via the tv (so if you're on a budget, its easy to keep on top of hotel expenses - very handy) with the benefit of Bilson's restaurant just downstairs. The location itself is perfect, and close to all the touristy sights, which as someone born and raised in Sydney, i now get a kick out of participating in, now that work has kept me away. The vibrancy of the city is right at your doorstep! I recently took a weekend away on my own as a stress reliever and to recharge my health, and ive got to say, the stay was better than any health spa or counselling session could ever be! ;o) Yes, the hotel can be pricey, but the experience is so worth the expense.

The location is superb for a business hotel in the centre of CBD, can walk to Chinatown or to Circular Quay anytime. Staff is also very friendly and everyone at the desk but this is not something expected of a 4 or 5 star hotel and here are some of the reasons why. - No complimentary water - Toothbrush, toothpaste [have to ask every 3 days], brush, slippers, razors have to ask when needed. - They don't throw newspapers and don't tidy the tables and basin area neatly all the time [even didn't washed the cups once] - Don't always replace stationery like papers, and sometimes they don't throw all the rubbish away like the laundry box that comes with the lingerie - Food is not as great [based on feedback from the rest, one order takes 40 minutes to come]. Beef patty was served instead when beef steak was ordered. - Housekeeping do not adhere to the \"do not disturb\" signs - Housekeeping and laundry are seperate and if we call for laundry late nights, they will say 'they have left for the day' and we have to call tomorrow morning - Laundry don't get picked up during cleaning in the day and we have to call the next day or they will leave a msg that they note we have laundry but we only got the msg at the end of the day after work.

All the usual toiletries - although I am still wondering how, according to the packaging, they make a shower cap \"luxury\" and how they do \"deluxe sanitary bags\"? There was also a vanity kit, sewing kit and shoe shine. waffle weave bathrobes were very nice, and a pillow menu (so I changed my pillow). Bathroom does have one of those magnifying \"shaving\" mirrors, and this was the only flaw in the room - its light was broken.. I used the gym which was as good as they come. treadies, stairclimbers, bikes, rowers, one of those multi-function pull down machines and free weights. They also have an indoor pool. Dinner room service was slow (they warned me on ordering) and was decent normal serving cooked well - although a tad expensive. I ate dinner in the bistro which was very good - full service, very good wait staff, food quite good - again just a tad on the expensive side. I travel with my work colleague who is in a wheelchair and they gave us good attentive, helpful service when arriving at the valet, with our bags, getting him in the chair lift etc. The only problem he had was that although the room was wheel chair accessible, housekeeping then treated the room like any other - so the toiletries and water glasses were placed up high out of reach on a shelf, the adjustable shower head was up high at standing height, the bed was too high for him, the wardrobes were normal so he couldn;t hang his clothes, the robes were hanging so he couldn't get them down, the door was a normal heavy door he couldn't push, light switches were up high etc etc BUT - the rooms were spotlessly clean, were obviously recently refurbished with new tiles, fabrics, carpet, easy a/c controls - and a great price - I rang around and it was the cheapest out of 6 I tried.

Not a problem - To me - that is good customer service. I've provided details on check in, you have my address etc etc, not an issue. Great, I went back and relaxed and did some work on Sunday whilst whiling away the time waiting to replace the card on Monday.... Well.. Sunday comes around and Ben (the duty manager at the time) appears at the door with another guy, they come in - quiz me about the stolen wallet and what not - generally skeptical (even though I was able to provide the police report number and bank cancellation number) and not providing what I would consider customer service. Ben then proceeds to tell me that basically he couldn't make a call and had to check that the on duty manager that I spoke to had made the right decision etc. Anyways - long story short, I get a phone call saying I have an hour to leave the hotel. So. No money due to the stolen wallet, no real means to return to where I am staying during the week whilst in Sydney and a complete reversal of a verbal agreement existing between the hotel management and myself. - To top it off, once I worked out how to get home etc etc The next day they call me AT WORK (Nikita was the one that rang) and say \" you need to settle this by wed or we'll be taking further action\" - Given that NONE of this was my fault, I have to say, being treated like a common criminal and not someone who paid to stay there leads me to say that I WOULD NOT recommend this hotel to people. Their management change their minds, break agreements and the treatment that I received was not at all to a satisfactory level. I work in Sydney during the week and live in QLD. On the weekend I tend to Stay in the city, I earn over $150k but perhaps it is because I am 30 and not 60 that I received this treatment, either way they have lost one customer, that is for certain...

If I want to be very picky, the only thing lacking is harbour view. My partner and I booked this hotel on last minute secret hotel which is great value for a 5 star hotel in the middle of CBD. Less than 5 min walk to Circular Quay, less than 5 min walk to Pitt Street Mall and one of my favourite Japanese restaruants is just around the corner. It's situated in a quiet street, away from the busy traffic and night clubs. The building is a heritage listed building (I love heritage buildings) but the hotel itself is very modern. Staff was very efficient and friendly. Initially we were given a room where hot shower is not working. We were upgraded immediately to another room. The room is nice, big, cosy and comfortable. All you expected in a 5 star hotel room. Great gym and functional swimming pool, spa and steam room.

We stayed there for 4 nights over the busy Christmas period. Check-in was not glitch free. The access card software had broken down and we were informed by a slightly snooty receptionist that we will be checked-in and we could collect our cards later. Apart from her, we found the rest of the staff unbelievably helpful and courteous. They were always up for a smile and full marks for their attentiveness and professionalism. The location cannot be faulted too. It is in a quiet part of the CBD but still close to the hustle and bustle of George Street and a short and pleasant walk to Circular Quay. Make sure you use the free CBD shuttle (#555) to explore the City. The hotel itself is in a fantastically reclaimed charming old building. The lobby looks tired and the vicinity around the lift area looks downright rundown. But things get better as you move up floors (ask for a higher floor) and enter the hallways. Everything is tastefully decorated and the room itself is excellent. Going with the theme of the hotel, everything is subdued and mild but tasteful. As you would expect from a 5 star hotel, everything works smoothly and housekeeping makes sure you have prompt service anytime you need it. Need extra towels - it will be in your room in 5 minutes, need a turn down service, no sweat at all. The indoor pool is adequate (for a CBD hotel) and the spa and sauna is fine. The shower in the bathroom is to die for and a reasonably deep bathtub adds to the comforts you would come to expect in a 5 star hotel. There is free fuss-free wireless internet in your room too. We had our laptop with us and this made making dinner reservations and getting directions easy. I would gladly stay at this hotel again. But if you are looking for the most luxurious five star hotel with sheer opulence at every turn, stay elsewhere. However, if you need great value for your money and pay just a bit more for 5 stars but not break the bank in trying to do so, you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely not a 5-Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "FreshSugar", "ReviewID": "UR53161529", "Content": "Pros: * Complimentary wireless internet in rooms * 24-hour Business Center * Great location, close to convenience stores, restaurants, the Rocks and Circular Quay all walking distance. * One of the lowest room rates I could find for a 5-star hotel in Sydney during peak holiday season. All the other hotels located within downtown were a lot pricer. Plus, some of the hotels charged 10 AUD per hour for internet in their rooms. Cons: * Do not stay anything at a lower priced than a Premier Room. We had so many issues with this one, I cannot imagine what it would be like staying at their regular rooms. * When we arrived at the hotel, the Bellhop was no where to be seen. There were stairs leading up to the lobby so we had to carry our heavy luggages up to the reservation desk. When the Bellhop finally appeared there was only a casual apology and he walked away. * when we arrived at our room, the pillows (the ones in black \"satin\") were oily and looked like they needed to be changed! * the shower door was broken. it wouldn't close properly so we had water coming out of the shower stall. * the bathroom door knob was broken. It broke off the first night we were there. * the cabinet door below the TV broke off it's hinge from old age the first week were were there. * when we requested an extra australian power adapter in our room, they asked us 3 times why we needed an extra one.... When obviously we had 2 laptops and needed to charge our cameras and camcorders. * service was inconsistant: sometimes they would forget to give us two bath robes! sometimes there would be one and some days there would be two. One day they will give us bottled water and the next couple of days they wouldn't. * there was a stain in our bath tub since we checked in... they didn't clean it until a couple of days later. it wasn't a very obvious stain, but it proved to us that they didn't clean the bath tub every day. * We found couple of pieces of broken glass in the hallway which they didn't clean up until the next afternoon. I cannot imagine kids in flip flops running in the hallways with pieces laying around like that. * One of the computers in the business center was broken for 3 days. Despite having a person at the business center service desk come in occasionally, the computer wasn't fixed until I had to notify the hotel.

We booked the hotel via lastminute.com (am I allowed to quote the website?) as a \"mystery deal\". So we did not actually know which hotel it was, beyond the fact that it cost about $160AU per night, and was 'located in the heart of the CBD, walking distance to Circular Quay'. We were pleased to find out that it was the Radisson, after payment. It cost us (with no traffic) about $30AU for a taxi from the airport. We were greeted by a doorman who cheerfully assisted us with our bags, without a hint of reproachment for a tip. (Besides, I had just used the last of my cash for lunch and the cab.) We got there about 11am, but we had to leave our luggage with the concierge, since the room would not have been ready for another hour. When we returned, our bags were already in the room. The room itself, like the lobby, was squeky clean and looked fairly new. The room was relatively large as well, so no complaints from me about the size. The bed was a queen size, and there were all the trimmings you would expect from a Radisson hotel: climate control, tv, minibar, desk, internet access, telephone, alarm clock, iron/board, safe, free tea/coffee, kettle, hair dryer etc. The bathroom was well appointed with both a shower and a bathtub (separate). The toiletries were ok as well. As we only stayed there two nights, our room was only cleaned once, but we had no complaints about the level of cleanliness on our return in the evening. We did not eat at the restaurant, or use room service, so we cannot comment on that. We did visit the fitness centre though, which was well equipped with a few treadmills and exercise machines, as well as a shallow exercise swimming pool with about 4 lanes, plus a spa on the side. My only complaint about this hotel, is the location. Now, the hotel is located in the CBD, but you are surrounded by tall office buildings that are shut on weekends and at night, so there is a fairly lonely feel to the location. There were no restaurants (to the best of my knowledge) within a 10 minute walking radius. Having said that, Circular Quay is just about 10 minutes walk away, where you can find a host of restaurants, the bridge, the Opera House, the ferries etc. After visiting Darling Harbour, we think that we would prefer to stay at a hotel in this area on our next visit, since it is far more lively. If you are a business traveller, with meetings in the CBD the following morning, then this hotel is for you. If you are a tourist, who does not mind a fair walk in a potentially lonely street at night for food, but only 10 mins walk from Circular Quay, then this hotel is also for you. Overall, 5 stars for interior and exterior, but only 4 stars for location (due to the touristy nature of my trip).", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - perfect for business\u201d", "Author": "le_corb", "ReviewID": "UR31855975", "Content": "Stayed for a few nights for work.

It would have been nice to have known that at the time of booking. The room furnishings were really good though and you could hear a pin drop it was that quiet.

I complained and front desk promised to block the room next door for the rest of my stay, but sadly this did not happen. I think you should not promise these things if its not going to happen.

The person on the phone said they would request an early book-in time and indicated that a room WOULD be ready for me when I arrived. I got there a bit after 10am on Thursday 4th December. The RUDEST staff member possible was at the reception counter!! My room had been booked and paid for by the organisation that had invited me to Sydney. The man at the counter confirmed my booking, and then requested a credit card from me. I told him I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one. He then told me to pay him $100 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in case I used the mini bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I told him that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have $100 and re-explained that the room had been paid for by the organisation and if there were any problems maybe he should talk to THEM! I also asked for the mini bar to be taken from my room as I had no intention of using it. The man then said that I had to wait until 2pm for a room to be available for me. I told him I was very tired and needed a cup of tea and a rest before having a shower, getting changed and attending the function at 3pm. He said I could use the shower at their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHealth Cub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I asked if there was a bed there I could rest on for a few hours... The answer was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He then turned away and ignored me.... I then told him I NEEDED to rest (NO offer of a cup of tea was forthcoming...) and would do so by sleeping on a sofa in the foyer until a room was available. Within half an hour of me stretching out on one of the lounges, a LOVELY, kind and helpful young staff member, Ravi Singh, approached me and said a room was available and I that would be upgraded to a Premier Room. She took me to this room, which had two double beds in it (placed about 30cm apart). Returning to the room with my Aunt later that night after the function, and wanting to make ourselves another cup of tea, we realised that there was no milk left, as there had been only 3 or 4 single portions of milk provided. After trying to call room service about four times they finally answered the phone and promptly brought 4 more single portions.... Strangely, there were only enough products for ONE guest in the bathroom, so we had to share the shower cap and shampoo... and there was only one armchair to sit on... There WAS an extra sugar packet, I discovered it imbedded in thick dust under the TV... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably STILL there! The next morning we went to check out at 9.30am. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpress check out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 counter was unattended and the same man was at reception. He ignored me when I asked him if I could check out until, worried that I would miss my flight back home if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave soon, I INSISTED on him taking my keys... He was SO RUDE that I approached another staff member in the foyer and asked him to identify the receptionist, whom he named as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAbdhallah\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I told this other staff member that I was going to write a review of the hotel, he looked shocked, then asked me what I was going to say in it.... I was SO disappointed to have this hotel stay almost ruined by the unpleasant Abdhallah. If there were more staff members like Ravi Singh employed to assist guests, it would almost be worth its five star rating....", "Date": "December 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brisbane", "Title": "\u201c5 Star All Way - I'll Be Back For Another Stay!\u201d", "Author": "jadore1", "ReviewID": "UR22369039", "Content": "I very recently stayed here and it was nothing short of my 5 star thoughts, I have been lucky enought to travel throughout the world and yes, sometimes what you think you're gonna get and what you do get can be very different but I was not sold short here.

The bathroom was a very good size; my only complaint would be that it did not have a tempature regulated mixer in the shower, so if someone flushed the toilet you tended to get scalded. The bed was reasonably comfortable and they do offer a pillow menu as well. Housekeeping was top points; the room appeared clean and replenished every day.

I was able to take a train from the airport to the Wynyard station, which is only a block away from the hotel. Because I was able to walk to almost all the places I wanted to visit in Sydney, I used public transportation very little. Some examples: Circular Quay (10-15 minutes' walk), Sydney Opera House (15-20 minutes), Pitt Street Mall (5-7 minutes). In the immediate vicinity of the hotel, were all the services I needed, such as two 24 hour convenience stores, book store, food courts, and ATM machines. Some comments I read suggested that the area was dead after office hours and on weekends, but I did not find that to be the case. There were always others on the street and I always felt totally safe, even with many late night walks back to the hotel from the Sydney Opera House. Neighborhood restaurants and entertainment venues were open nightly. Room. I had an inside room on the 10th floor. It was large and had every imaginable convenience and amenity. I particularly liked the iPod docking station with speakers. The room itself was furnished in the \"contemporary\" or \"minimalist\" style favored by international chains.

They were friendly and went beyond just answering a question or providing a service. I consider the friendliness and competency of the staff a prime attribute of this fine hotel. Plaza Club. Because I was going to stay for 12 nights, I decided to spend the extra money and upgrade to the Plaza Club, or whatever they call it. Breakfast in the Plaza Club, which was located on my floor, while not grotesquely elaborate like some five star hotels, was plentiful, varied and delicious. The cocktail hour at night was replete with wonderful food. I had free access to the PCs in the business center (I don't travel with a laptop) 24 hours a day.

We had booked two single beds, but basically got a king bed that had been split in two but both sides were still right next to each other (I mean literally, about half a centimetre gap) - not ideal at all. The beds were peculiarly made with thin mattresses on top of other enormous mattresses, with sheets that didn't tuck in properly and it all just kept sliding off and coming untucked. There were two odd bedside lamps hanging right down from the ceiling at head height, so every time we got out of bed or sat up we banged our heads. We didn't even get saucers to go with our cups.

The swimming pool was average (the pictures do it a lot of favours), the steam room smelt horrible, and the spa was tiny and closed for maintenance. The whole hotel felt like a bolthole for airline staff and for corporate conferences.

The location, just a short stroll from the Central Quai and a few blocks from the George Street Shops and the touristy Darling Harbour, was ideal for pedestrian travellers. It will be our first choice on a return visit to the city. Booking via the internet was efficient and easy. Our room while on the smaller side, was perfect for the two of us. It was excellently maintained, and extremely comfortable. All of the staff we met from doorman to concierge were extremely courteous and helpful, and we could only praise their professionalism and their service. It was much of the same calibre as boutique hotels in which we have stayed, and there is a very comfortable \"small hotel\" feel to the Radisson Plaza. Our only complaint was with the buffet breakfasts. The buffet trays were not always kept full, and the choices were somewhat mundane. At thirty plus Australian Dollars per person, we felt the prices exhorbitant and after one breakfast, we walked across the street to a cafe. There, waiting for our order to arrive, we sipped coffee and juice, enjoyed the passing parade and talked to each other. We did not have to wait in line for a short order cook who was trying to catch up on the bacon tray, stand in line for toast to be cooked, wait for the juice container to be refilled, and hope that there would be hot hashbrowns or pancakes ready when we finally got to that section of the buffet. . It actually took less time for our restuarant ordered breakfast to arrive, and it cost significantly less ($7.00 Au) per person. . A significant difference in price. We noticed in booking, that the prices for the rooms dropped as it got closer to our anticipated date of arrival. We paid quite a few dollars less than the rate that was initially posted for the room by waiting until shortly before our arrival date to reserve.

After some shuffling, my reservation was found since it had originally been made as a pre-registered arrival (room held for an early morning check-in). The check-in clerk was quite apologetic and indeed efficient. Having found my room, he checked me in and off i went. As i opened the door to the room i immediately realised I had been checked into the wrong room. The original booking had been for a 1br king spa suite (shown on the web site and advertised with a guest toilet). I had changed the booking once removing the pre-registration request and had sent 2 emails requesting informatio neither of which have ever been acknowledged. On the day i was checking in (interstate local) I sent a fax to the hotel requesting a later check-out and a pillow request (since the hotel advertises a pillow menu). So i had done all I could to make my requests known. Back down to the check-in and again the staff member was most apologetic but the reservation (and I had all the details of the booking) at the hotel end was not correct. However after moving some people off their allocated upgrades (sorry bout that) I was given the 1 br spa king I had booked. No pillow request, no late check-out confirmation, no guest toilet. I know things can go wrong, I am in the industry, but with so much follow through from my end it just really surprised me that a hotel so highly reviewed by TA (and my choice was based on that) could get it so wrong. To the Hotels credit they did give me late check-out. Overall, this is a good hotel for tourists coming in from overseas on exchange rates that make you think it is cheap but for the average australian traveller it is over rated and over priced.

Bilson's restaurant is located within the hotel and is one of only seven Sydney restaurants to be given the \"three hat\" award by the Sydney Herald. It was expensive but well worth the experience.

Other than that, everything was plush and neat and I wouldn't mind staying there again (hopefully not on the same floor!).", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA gem !\u201d", "Author": "OzVoyager", "ReviewID": "UR6649780", "Content": "A hotel that has it all worked out.

The hotel is really a great place to discover all the fantastic sites of Sydney in short time - you are in walking distance of nearly everything - max 10 minutes walk to the opera and the Rocks and less still to the wharf. The rooms are very nice, of appropriate size and clean. The only thing I would complain about is the expensive breakfast, a little less in prize would have been enough as well. Service in the breakfast period is not five star as well. However, the concierge staff is more than friendly and helpful. They booked us a table at Doyle`s on the beach - take the ferry and have lunch there from the veranda and enjoy awesome seafood and a terrific view on Sydney! When going to the Blue Mountains for one day they were also very helpful to explain the way out of the city as Sydney is rather terrible to drive if you are not a local.
