BUT the room had a bathroom outside the room which was not mentioned on the web site and the entrance and the building were really poor and the reception is not available after 5 in the afternoon. In addition, since the room was far off what was presented on the web site and the room with bathroom inside, according to the lady was not available because the window is broken, I wanted to leave after only one night. It is June, 2011 I stayed and the room was incredibly hot and only a small fan was in the room. When I was checking out the next day they told me that I have to pay 80% of 2 nights because I didn't cancel three days before!! While we were talking to the reception guy, this other guy (says he was the owner or whatever) came out of nowhere and started screaming at me and my friend who was there to help me, to pay the money. It was unbelievable attitude of them and I got the hell out of there as soon as I could. I do not definitely recommend to ANYBODY if you are considering going there, please for your own sake don't. I'd recommend you to spend a little more money and effort to look for else where.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201csimple but clean\u201d", "Author": "nef_tr", "ReviewID": "UR90490280", "Content": "its not a typical hotel!its in the 3rd floor of a building.its small but warm and clean!nice breakfast not too rich but nice!for the money it was reaaly nice and near the metro!", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely no frills\u201d", "Author": "ShoegalNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR81802114", "Content": "The pension is located in a relatively poor neighborhood where the streets are lined with night shops, kebab joints, Internet cafes, etc, though it is just about a 2-minute walk from the subway station. Personally, I would not be comfortable walking around at night alone in this area. My friend and I had a hard time finding the place since it is poorly indicated, and the building is old and the lift was a bit smelly. Make sure you get to the hotel during the daytime, since there is no receptionist at the place. OR make very clear arrangements so someone will be there to open the front door for you. Having said that, the hotel itself is very clean and the free breakfast was quite decent considering for a double we paid 49 euro per night (we had our own bathroom, super clean). Not that the staff is mean-spirited, but you won't get any smiles or good mornings (in fact, I got the impression the staff didn't speak English). I would recommend this hotel to people who just want a place to sleep while on a short visit to Berlin and who is ok with absolutely no frills and no service..", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cRun Forrest Run!\u201d", "Author": "Loesje97", "ReviewID": "UR70281002", "Content": "If you're in for just cheap, it's a fair deal.
