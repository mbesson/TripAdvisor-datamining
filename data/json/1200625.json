Barking train station is a mere 5-10 mins walk so don't believe that review where it took them 2 hours to find the hotel. That is simply nonsense. Barking station offers trains which take you direct into Liverpool Street, and also the district and Hammersmith and City lines, if I am not mistaken. The town cenre is not very pleasant for people not used to East London but I knew what to expect. There were plenty of people around the town centre at night and I did not feel in danger at all. There are many fast food joints around, a big indoor shopping centre. The council has really been improving this area in time for the Olympics. I was lucky and I got a big room. It offered the same things that a typical Travelodge room would. Soap and towels in the bathroom. Tea and coffee, kettle and flat-screen TV which is fixed on the wall facing the bed - this was the only negative point. The remote control did not work - either the batteries needed replacing or it was a generic controller which was not properly programmed. For me, it was a small issue since I was only staying one night. One thing people need to be aware of - Travelodge do not have a luggage room - a consequence of its pricing model. Another negative review, written by Loren988, simply sounds unbelievable: \"Thieves...they stole one gold bracelet ... is very dirty,smels horrible,the sheets smels like urina..if u have luck you will fin toilet paper.the stuff is unfriendly,they will boder you as long you will stay.i travel a lot and stay very much in hotels but none was like this.i will never stay here even if they pay me to sty here.i will go and check a doctor to see if I m healthy after4night at this trash hotel.\" First, you can not even write correct English. Second, why would you keep something so valuable, like a gold bracelet, in a hotel room? Third, bedsheets are cleaned before a room is given to guests so how can it smell of urine? Fourth, you could ask for toilet paper if there was none. But I honestly do not believe you. Fifth, you say you travel a lot, but I find only 2 Tripadvisor reviews from you and the other one is saying the same thing about Travelodge, Bristol. I will bet you are someone who was fired from Travelodge and is now trying to say bad things about the franchise. And as for the report from sarapinfold, why did you not ask for another room if it was as bad as you described? If it was really as bad as you say it was, the hotel would have given you another room.

In fact it turned out to be no worse than the other London area Travelodges I have stayed in. At least for once I didn't have to go to reception to ask for the extra towels and bedding you would expect if you booked a family room. OK, the shower curtain and bathroom pedal bin lid are missing - but I have never had a generous two bars of soap in a Travelodge before. Also, the windows seem to have good sound insulation, but there is no A/C so it must get very hot sometimes if you keep the windows closed (and it is in a typically Travelodge noisy location). Tesco Express is just round the corner so although the hotel itself doesn't have any catering facility, you can easily pop out for a snack until late at night. Barking train station is around 5 minutes walk; c2c trains have a good reputation for punctuality but my experiences with them were not good and if I ever come here again I'll probably try the Underground although it's a lot of stops from central London. All in all, if you can get a room for the \u00c2\u00a319 they keep advertising, it's OK - the problem with Travelodge is that it pretends to compete with the likes of Holiday Inn Express and Premier Inn - it's like comparing Ryanair to British Airways and Emirates. My biggest gripe with Travelodge in general is the way the fairly small screen TV is fixed high up on the wall so you can only see it from the bed, and their idea of a comfy chair in the newer outlets is hard plastic. There is nowhere to put your things by the bed - just a small hole in the headboard that can hardly fit a travel alarm clock let along anything else. The range of TV and Radio channels is inexplicably very limited. If you need anything or if something is wrong with the room you have to go all the way back to reception to ask for it, and even then the shortage of staff often means nothing is done about it. You certainly wouldn't want to be in a Travelodge room a minute longer than you have to.

The hotel is a bit of distance away from central London. The hotel is located about 3 minutes or so from Barking station which is served by overground, Hammersmith and City line, and District line trains. The hotel may be difficult to locate on Google Maps and Bing Maps as the area is newly developed. The easiest way to find it would be to look for Barking police station which is located right next door to the hotel. Access to the hotel is from the back of the building next door to the police station. There is a Tesco Express on the ground floor, on the front of the building, on the same side as the police station entrance. The hotel is very poorly maintained. One of the 2 lifts was not working for the whole week that I was staying at the hotel. The stairs are dirty, and it was evident that it was not cleaned nor vacuumed in the entire time when I was there. The one lift which was working was not much cleaner either. I was given room 120 located on the first floor, facing the front of the building (the same side as the front of the police station). The room was quite large. The carpet in the room appear to be dirty even though it was a dark coloured carpet. The bathroom floor was also dirty. The shower appears to be cleaner, but the shower screen was mouldy. The mattress felt quite worn. The TV worked fine, though the remote control would not work from time to time. The room was very poorly insulated and sound proofed, making it very noisy to the point where one can clearly hear conversations and footsteps of people walking pass downstairs. The hotel purportedly tries to keep costs low, not providing much amenities. However, the cleaner left all the lights in the room on every day! The key card would randomly fail to work. The hotel's computer system had record of me staying for the whole week, so there is no reason for the hotel resetting my key card. The staff claims that they automatically reset the key cards every 24 hours. However, there were days when the key card worked over a period of more than 24 hours, thus refuting his claim.

On the morning of the competition, the lock on the room that held our competition stuff broke which meant we were unable to get into the room.

That same evening, the lock again stuck on the door meaning that we coud not get into the room for a further 90 minutes, again making us late for an evening reception we were expected to attend. After some argument, they did agree to change the rooms but that did not make up for our lateness to both the competition and the evening reception.

The Big Question!\u201d", "Author": "NicolaNicolaNicola", "ReviewID": "UR68765415", "Content": "We stayed at the Tavelodge Barking while in London to visit the O2. We won tickets to a gig in the arena less than a week before the event and as we live in Liverpool we wanted somewhere CHEAP to stay while we were in London. Everything we found in Central London/Excel seemed to be out of our price range and so we started to look slightly further away. We came across the Travelodge online and at \u00c2\u00a347.50 a night it was less than half the price of our next best option so we decided to give it a go. We arrived into Euston and from there we took the Northern Line to Moorgate then the Hammersmith and City Line straight to Barking Station. The Journey took about 30 minutes and was very simple. The Travelodge is about a 5 minute walk from Barking Station. Simply walk out of the station, turn right, walk down the shopping street until you reach McDonalds, then look to the left and you will see the hotel entrance. For the O2 we took either the Hammersmith and City Line or the District Line to West Ham then took the Jubilee Line to Greenwich North. The Journey took about 20 minutes and was so easy. I would say it was much quicker than travelling from Central London and because of the direction MUCH less busy when leaving the arena in crowds of people. Barking itself is quite a busy area. Immediatly outside the hotel is a busy shopping area with shops, banks and restaurants. The area seems very multi cultural and there is something for everyone. It is a little scruffy and perhaps not the type of place you would want to spend a weeks holiday but if you simply want a cheap base with great transport links then it's fine for a night or 2. We returned from the O2 around Midnight and the Barking streets at night were a little intimidating. Travelling with my partner I felt quite safe but I am not sure I would have returned so late if I was alone or with a girlfriend. (but the same could be said of any city I do not know that well) The Travelodge itself was a standard Travelodge like the rest (but obviously brand new). Very clean, spacious room, small flat screen TV, good power shower. My only complaint about the room is that the window didn't open very far and the weather was so hot during our stay. All in all we were happy with our stay and for the price we cannot complain!", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice for the price\u201d", "Author": "worldtraveller186220", "ReviewID": "UR67004746", "Content": "Stayed for 1 night to take advantage of a 21GBP per night rate.

I and a colleague arrived at 6.00 pm to stay overnight for a meeeting the following morning. The desk staff refused to allow us to go to our rooms because we could not provide a \"home address\".which was difficult as the rooms had been booked and paid for in advance by our employer. After initially offering to contact the manager the reception clerk claimed that he was not available saying that their was nothing he could do ,we couldn't have the rooms and that it was \"not his problem\". I assured the man that I was willing to make it his problem by arguing all night if needed and after 40 minutes of this in which we were repeatedly told that it was \"not his problem\" he made a simple call which confirmed that we had a valid booking and that the rooms were paid for.During this call the receptioist checked the spelling of my name on his computor screen wher it has obviously been displayed throughout.. By the time that this member of staff was willing to check us in my colleague and I were too late to catch a tube to central London to make use of the \u00c2\u00a370 worth of theatre tickets which we had also bought in advance.

We stayed for a week at a ridiculously low rate (just under \u00c2\u00a3100 total!!). The hotel itself is very new and our room was large, clean and in very good condition. Being Travelodge the room very basic, but it did include a nice LCD TV and a coffee/tea maker. We did have to ask staff everyday to give us a second set of towels, but that is a relatively minor issue considering the huge cost savings. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the train station, and is only a few steps off of the pedestrianized main street. There are plenty of places to shop, eat, and drink close to the hotel and there was a street market multiple times over the week. Don't think I saw/heard another tourist the whole time we were in that area...quite nice really. Barking station is served by two Underground lines, but the fastest and most comfortable way of going into Central London seemed to be via the C2C trains to Fenchurch (about 13-15 minutes), and then getting on the Underground at Tower Hill. Load a zone 1-4 travelcard onto your Oyster Card and it will cover all of the options.
