Not only was it more like the traditional two double bed hotel rooms I'm used to at home, but there was an air purifier and a fabulous reclining massage chair in it as well. My daughter has allergies so I was worried about her asthma acting up as we were staying in a smoking room, but the air purifier made the place odour free. There is no view due to the surrounding skyscrapers, but the 45th floor of the government buildings is only two blocks away and it's free!", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR804904440", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ArankaC"}, {"Content": "Great location. Small but perfect rooms Stayed the Kodoya Hotel, Shinjuku area of Tokyo for three nights in April 2008. The hotel is just 5 mins' walk from Shinjuku station and an easy 10 mins walk from a stack of bars and restaurants. The bedroom was small but clean and perfect with a great view of the street. On the ground floor, there was an adquate cafe serving breakfast. A big plus is a lively basement restaurant serving grilled Japanese food. No WiFi in the hotel which was a bit of a shame, but free internet for your lap top. Would stay again.

The sink was clogged with hair and there was mould growing on the bathroom wall.What made the experience worse was that the air conditioning pumped out hot air! When we called down to reception we were told there was no need for air conditioning despite the fact the rooms were extremely hot.. This meant we had to sleep with the window open which was noisy at all hours.And don't bother with the breakfast in the next door cafe either!

Single room is large for a business hotel. Location is great, better than the neighbouring Keio Plaza and Hyatt Regency costing 2x to 3x as much.You can book at other than hotel's own site but it will be the same rates, though English and Japanese booking sites do have different booking requirements and special plans. If you don't read Japanese, you can't take advantage of those. They have BBC World but dubbed in Japanese(at source) except for a few hours during the day and at night.

Excellent location in West Shinkjuku makes this a great base for exploring Tokyo. It's a 5 minute walk from the west exit of Shinkuju station so not far too drag bags to.

If you book BB breakfast is taken in the adjacent cafe - absolutely fine, western or Japanese options. If you don't fancy this, there a couple of excellentcoffee shops over the road.

The location is great - a 3 minute walk to Shinjuku Station (which is handy for the airport bus and lots of metro and mainline rail services), and a 10 minute walk to the big Shinjuku department stores (including our absolute favourite - Isetan!). There are lots of shops and restaurants over the road but the hotel is set on a quieter block. We found the double room that we started out in to be a little cramped and the friendly and obliging staff moved us to a twin room a couple of doors down that cost just over 1000 yen more but was quite a bit bigger. It's definitely worth paying extra for a larger room. Both rooms were quiet and spotlessly clean.

The staff were friendly and they spoke enough english to get by. Breakfast is served in the adjoining cafe - with a choice of 4 different menus - they made no problem about changing the coffee/tea option for a cup of hot chocolate every morning. I thought the price was really reasonable - we paid about 75 euros a night for the 2 of us in a double room (breakfast not included - that was about 4 euros with the 100 yen discount coupon they gave us).the best thing has to be the location - shinjuku is really lively every day of the week - there are loads of very affordable restaurants and shops, there's a starbucks really close to the hotel, game halls (look out especially for the drum game - not the modern looking one, but the one with the 2 round drums - one face is red the other blue - brilliant fun), we also stumbled on a baseball batters ball hitting area in the east side of shinjuku. Walking straight behind the hotel, away from the station, are the metropolitan south and north towers, which give you a good view of tokyo - free and open until 23pm.

We were not disappointed. The hotel is well located, between the skyscraper district and the entertainment area near Shinjuku JR Station.

There are plenty of places to eat and shop nearby, several department stores and banks. Depending on the weather you can walk to Shinjuku station underground. The staff at the lobby was very helpful and there is a pc that you can use for free to check the Internet. The breakfast (not included) was not a great deal but you can find good places very close. There is a laundry inside the hotel. Check out time is 11:00 am, which is very convenient for flights to the US.
