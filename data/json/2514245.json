In all honesty I must tell you this is an incredible opportunity to really enjoy London with all the comforts you might want. These apartments are so head and shoulders above a hotel room. Having an apartment gives you so many more options in your stay. You can get up and decide to have whatever you want for breakfast versus chose from a menu or try to fit what someone else offers as a small buffet. The Sanctum provides everything you might need from frying pans to six quart pans. My greates criteria for a place is safe and clean and Sanctum is exceeding well done on both issues. Sanctum is also located near all modes of public transportation. Having said that I will go on to tell you that the apartments are very well insulated so there is no street noise bothering you.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSpacious apartments, convenient location and excellent service!\u201d", "Author": "Michael L", "ReviewID": "UR119140211", "Content": "We are a family of 5 and we stayed here a few nights 3 times within 4 weeks! We loved it that much! London was our base for our Europe trip and we kept coming back here because it is great value. The apartment was modern and cozy, the rooms were well equipped and a full kitchen is very helpful when you have a big family to feed. Marks and Spencer is a 2 minute walk down the road and we could get great tasting meals already prepared and have a dinner at our dining table pretending we cooked the food ourselves! Also the number 16 bus right outside the apartments takes you straight to Victoria station! And the metro underground is a short walk. But the best thing about the apartment is probably the service, there is someone at the front desk 24/7 and there is always someone to help you with your luggage. We actually kept one of our suitcases here while we went to Paris via the Eurostar train for a small fee. Everything was great and we will definitely be staying here a 4th time in the future.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "essex", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommend\u201d", "Author": "breadsauce", "ReviewID": "UR118323677", "Content": "Myself and 4 friends rented a 3 bedroomed Apartment for 2 nights as a weekend break.

After our wonderful experience here, we definitely will be returning again. The Sanctum is outside of central London (Zone 2) but travel is quick and easy with a bus stop and several bus lines located right outside the front door. The Kilburn Park Tube Station on the Bakerloo line is only a three minute walk around the corner. The Overground stop is just a block up the street but the trains were experiencing some delays while we were there so we kept with the bus and the Tube. The staff is helpful, professional, and friendly and really made our stay pleasant. Check-in and check-out was easy, even with an early morning departure. The living room and bedroom was spacious compared to the space you'd find at other London hotel rooms. There is free high-speed internet with a cable connection. However, the cable itself is only three or four feet long and connected from behind the TV so where we could use our laptop was restricted somewhat. The kitchen is beautiful and well-stocked for cooking quick meals. There was only a small quantity of dish soap and laundry soap provided so we did need to purchase a few extra necessities. There is a Tesco Express two doors down and an M&S Food as well as a Sainsbury's a few blocks away. Overall, we really had a wonderful experience at the Sanctum and highly recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201ca very enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "AliceWilson", "ReviewID": "UR90268503", "Content": "I was booking a hotel in London from all what I could read on the internet about places. We were looking for a place that had a few mandatory items- free internet, a kitchen, some space. Everything else seemed to be left to chance, as far as people's reviews and what I read on the internet. We did not want to stay at a hotel that was so large it took forever to make it to the front door (some of the hotels had over a thousand rooms) and I was nervous about staying at some place that we rented from the owner (some of the long term stays). We were really pleased with the hotel. Having looked at the \"Dirtiest Hotels in \u2026\" I was concerned about the pictures given versus real life. The suite looked as good in real life as it did on the website. The suite was large, the kitchen well equipped, the rooms clean and the bathroom was a nice mixture of marble and soapstone. The staff were all very nice. The location was maybe a bit further away from the actual downtown London than I initially thought it was, but I was glad because it was quiet. The last time I stayed in London, it was a long time ago and the place was noisy. This was quiet. Until I got into London again, I forgot how tiny the blueprint of the city actually is. This hotel was close to the tube station and it was easy to get to downtown. We did have a few problems with things needing repaired (the washing machine did not drain) but they fixed it right away. Another reviewer also commented on the perfumey sprays in the hall (not so much in our room) and that I did not like. I wish hotels as a whole stopped using perfume sprays. As far as would I stay here again\u2014definitely. It was well priced for what we got. It was a very comfortable hotel to sleep in, it was close to some shopping and a Starbucks and the tube and the train. The front desk were helpful and pleasant but left us to ourselves. It was a very relaxing experience, staying in this hotel. I felt we lucked out by picking this hotel because it was even better than I thought it would be.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guildford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMuch Improved, Fantastic Experience\u201d", "Author": "Globetrotter_5678", "ReviewID": "UR26842884", "Content": "I had previously written a review about how dreadful this place was. I am happy to say that I am writing this time to extol its virtues. It is clean, friendly, and well-maintained. The only complaints that I have are that they use a heavily fragranced detergent on their linens, that the halls have a strong air freshener, and that the housekeepers spend a ridiculous amount of energy tucking the blankets all round the bed rather than doing more practical things like cleaning the microwave. There are some outdated notices posted in the apartments and in the welcome book, like one about not washing glasses in the dishwasher less they fine you for damage to the dishwasher in the kitchen and one about calling them to switch the climate control from heat to cool and vice versa in the guest information book. Some repairs of the wear and tear on walls and wood furniture would be a welcome improvement but unless you're very picky shouldn't dampen your enjoyment of the apartment. It is just a very nice property in a reasonably safe location near two stations and several bus lines and many practical shops, restaurants, and pubs.

Sanctum is a short let/long let apartment block. Somebody said elsewhere that is a four star \u2018hostel\u2019. Maybe, but it does not give the \u2018feel\u2019 of a hostel. The minute you walk in, you are greeted by the friendly staff. I met the manager, who was friendly and helpful, and showed the rooms available. We chose a room of a good size, bathroom, and kitchen with all the necessary gadgets. There was a large TV and of course, internet. Air conditioners and all the rooms had phones. We stayed for two weeks, which we all enjoyed. It is true about notices being slipped under your door reminding you about placing drinking glasses into the dish-washer. But yet, everyday, the maid would place glass ware into the dish-washer!! There was a broken glass but we were not charged for it or rather we got back our full deposit. Sanctum Apartments is on the cusp of Kilburn High Road and Maida Vale, just above the slick looking Kilburn Library. Another plus is that we had a car, and the Sanctum has underground parking (so does the Marriott). I loved the fact that I could get on the bus and within ten minutes I\u2019m in Notting Hill, Holland Park, Oxford St and Knightsbridge, Camden and St John\u2019s Wood. So there are all the shops, restaurants, you are really spoilt for choice.
