The courtyard was a great place to relax after a day of sightseeing.

The staff we all very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The hotel is extremely well situated within a very short distance (50 metres) of St Marks Square, so you are in the very heart of historic Venice. This was very important to us as we had only about 36 hours in Venice so we needed to be within easy walking distance of all the main sights. My room was perhaps a little compact but was very clean, tidy, cosy and comfortable. My room was also very quiet indeed and I slept very well here. We paid about 180 euro for our room and I felt that for this location in Venice that was pretty good value. The hotel is attractively decorated throughout. Breakfast was very pleasant with a good buffet-style selection of bread, croissants, fruit, breakfast cereals, juice, coffee and so on. The hotel is quite atmospheric as it is right on a canal and you can get a gondola from the steps of the hotel if you wish. The hotel is also surrounded by restaurants and you will have no problem getting a good meal somewhere close.

The hotel itself was very nice with the rooms recently refurbished and absolutely spotless, as was the whole hotel. The room was spacious and modern with everything you could need.

The location of the hotel was also great with a two minute walk to the beautiful Piazza San Marco and only about a 10 minute walk to the Rialto, if you don't get lost down the many canal streets but that is half the fun.

While the room and bathroom were not spacious, this was to be expected in Venice. Our room was on the first floor and the window overlooked a busy thoroughfare and a pizzeria. Nevertheless, we were not troubled by noise due to the effective soundproofing of the double-glazed windows. The bed was comfortable. There were TV channels in English and best of all, free wi-fi. The location was fantastic, just off St Mark's Square. Plenty of eatery and delightful shops around. You can also take the gondola which can reach up to the hotel's doorstep if you wish to (we did not). The water-bus station for the Alilaguna line to the airport was also within walking distance and this was a key point for us as Venice was our last stop in Italy and we could reach the airport easily from here.

Not exciting as views in Venice go, but it didn't matter as we weren't there to look out the window! The room was small but very well furnished and clean. The bed is king size, there are two narrow wardrobes, a safe, mini bar, TV with European Sky, two chairs and a table. The bathroom is also small but the shower (no bath) is excellent: hot water, good water pressure, two shower heads (detachable wand on the wall plus a rainfall shower head above). Breakfast is the usual selection of juice, fresh pastries, fruit (tinned but still nice), cold meats, yoghurt, cereal. You can have bacon and scrambled egg cooked if you want. A decent selection of teas and the usual variations for coffee. Other reviews note that this hotel has recently been refurbished and it shows. Everything looks smart.

Our family of three did not have a great start to our holiday as the BA flight was delayed for two hours which meant we arrived past midnight, hence transport from Marco Polo airport to the hotel was limited. We took a taxi from the airport to the waterbus station at Roma. This cost us 46 Euro which was not unreasonable. From there, we took a waterbus (vaporetto) to San Zaccaria station which is the closest to the hotel. I had printed instructions from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website (http://www.hotel-leisole.it/hotel_in_venice-48/hotel_near_san_marco) on how to get to the hotel but please be sure you know which waterbus Line you are using as the hotel instructions stated that we should cross the bridge on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the San Zaccaria station. This only applies if you take Line 1. Our line stopped at the other San Zaccaria station and we should have turned \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (there are many bridges in Venice!!). No one was around to ask in the middle of the night and it was dark (and you needed to speak Italian anyway). We rang the hotel to inform them that we were late and a bit lost and the receptionist kindly came out to look for us. The hotel is tucked away, next to a small canal, the entrance to the hotel is quite small, with a rather insignificant hotel plaque on the wall, so you could miss it easily (see photos). The return journey was easier without any hassles and we took a waterbus direct from San Zaccaria station, to the airport for 15 Euro pp one way (25 Euro return) and it takes just over an hour. The hotel receptionist will be able to give you a schedule of times. We were able to store our luggage for the day at the hotel after checking out. This boutique hotel is in a great location, one minute from San Zaccaria station and three minutes from St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square. It is quiet, new, clean and tastefully decorated, modern with touches of Venetian grandeur. We had a room with a large double bed and a single bed for our daughter. The air conditioning made the room very comfortable. Our bathroom was a bit smaller than usual (probably tiny by American but not so by European standards, with a half sized bath). It was adequate for us and the shower was great. We watched BBC news on the Sky channels on the TV. You will need to get a username and password from reception for the free Wifi. Bedroom slippers, hair dryer, safe and fridge were available. The only thing missing for me in the room was tea/coffee making facilities. Breakfast was buffet with a good selection and a cooked breakfast was also offered. We ate enough not to need any lunch. Surprisingly the tea served was quite decent. The waitress was very efficient and helpful. The courtyard in the hotel was lovely to sit in, in the early mornings with a cup of cappuccino but got warm quite quickly. I agree with some of the reviewers that food and dining is expensive in Venice, unless you just eat pizza every evening. As the portions were small, even the set menus were not value for money as they usually only offer a pasta starter and a main with either a salad or vegetables, so by the time you add a desert and/or coffee, it could set you back more than 25-30 Euro pp. As it was very hot the three days we spent there, we were drinking bottled water by the bucket loads. Bottled water from the stalls were about 1 Euro a bottle, so my suggestion is to stock up at the Co-op near the hotel which is about 2-3 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk away. Uniquely there are quite a few drinking fountains around Venice, mainly in the squares in front of churches, where some people were happy to drink from or fill up their bottles. It was a lovely atmosphere in the evening at St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square when the Basilica and Doges Palace were lit up, but be prepared to pay 8 Euro for a coffee if you wish to sit outside the cafes by the square to enjoy their live outdoor music. Other evening entertainment includes the Opera House, Vivaldi concerts and a small theatre play, along with the bars. The hotel has a pocket map which was very useful for getting around with. If you intend to explore the numerous museums around Venice, it might be worthwhile getting the museum pass as it covers most but not all of them. You will also avoid some of the queues. At this time of year (July), St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square was heaving with tourists. Ask for info at the tourist office in the square which is situated at the far end along the shops and find out which ones are covered. It is worthwhile asking the ever helpful receptionist(s) at the hotel, where most things are, before you set off. The Clock Tower is a must as the views at the top are spectacular. We found the audio guide useful. There were also quite a few temporary smaller exhibitions around and we were fortunate to see the Dali exhibition. We did not feel it necessary to go on the numerous walking tours offered as we walked leisurely around at our own pace instead of being in huge groups. We only took one organised four hour tour to the Murano, Burano and Torcello islands. You can get a voucher at the hotel reception which you need to exchange for tickets at the booth where you board the boat or you can purchase the same price tickets there. Do shop around for your souvenirs as they vary in price for the same things. In fact, it was cheaper bartering in Venice (e.g. at Rialto bridge) than in the factory shop in Murano for some of the glass souvenirs. Prices were cheaper further away from the centre of Venice, e.g. at Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Oro. The gondola rides were pricey, 80-100 Euro for a gondola, so it might be worthwhile to share. Make sure you dress appropriately for the casino at San Marcuola if you intend to visit. Slot machines available from 11:00 and tables open at 15:30. If you have more time in Venice, you could go on a tour to the vineyards (available on Sat and Tues only) or a trip over to Lido for cycling along the beach. All in all a great short break in very comfortable accommodation.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cA calm, neat gem hidden close to San Marco.

However, not only is the place pretty and neat and so clean and calm, but also this hotel has one of the best, most helpful, nicest staffs I have dealt with in long while (I work in international acquisition, so I do get a lot of hotel time.) They would help you with the same great attitude at 6 am and at 10 pm. They would give you good advices about where to go and what to in Venice, and do whatever they can to make your stay pleasant and make you feel at home. The room was perfect. So calm and clean and complete and well put together. In general, the hotel and the deco make a good balance subduing the Venetian classic luxurious look (not my thing) and getting a calming, more modern but yet vintage look. The bathroom is gorgeous and pristine you can have a wonderful bath or a quick shower. The breakfast is fabulous, abundant, healthy. If you are into eggs (I am certainly not), they'll prepare you a great American breakfast, but if you are more into lighter meals, they offer great fruits, cereals, yogurts, bread, cheese, and meets. The patio where you can have breakfast is also a little beauty. Wireless internet is free and works well all the time. One of the most wonderful aspects of the hotel is that it is both silent and calm, and just a couple of blocks away from piazza San Marco. It is each to reach with the vaporetto, and it is a wonderful walk to almost anywhere in Venice. I'll stay at Hotel Le Isole the next time and all the times after that.
