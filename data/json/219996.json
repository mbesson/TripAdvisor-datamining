It is in the middle of paris and only 5 minutes from Notre Dame Cathedral. The central location was perfect for walking to most sites. But the subway is easy to use! There are NY Times newspapers available and the bathroom is more American than European. Great shower once the hot water starts...We had a small market 30 yards away that we visited daily for cheese, crackers and great inexpensive french wine!

I had booked a superior twin room (I was travelling with my mother) and on arrival was told it wasn\u2019t available for the first night. They had a double room we could have for that night however. To compensate, they provided us with breakfast at no extra cost for the full time we stayed there. That was fine for us \u2013 things happen. The first room was beautifully furnished and clean. The building is old and they have retained some original features. The room was quite small without enough space to put two large cases on the floor. I could open the window and step out on to a balcony however and had a great view of the main street. The bathroom was also compact. We were cramped but okay. This room would suit a single traveller or a loved up couple. The next day they moved our bags to the superior twin room. This again was beautifully furnished and clean. We had much more room and could leave our cases on the floor. The bathroom was also large and modern. The rooms have a tea and coffee tray and free Wi-Fi. The hotel has a snug lift and winding stair case.The breakfast was served in the basement. It had cereal, bread, bread rolls, croissants, ham, cheese, boiled egg, orange juice, coffee, tea and yoghurt. I\u2019m not sure that many people have the breakfast as often we were the only people there. There are plenty of places nearby to have breakfast also. The staff were always helpful and friendly. We booked them to pick us up from the train station and that worked well. I have been to Paris a number of times and love the Isle St Louis. I have always wanted to stay on the island. It is like a little village and we ate in the various restaurants on the island each night. It has a supermarket, pharmacy and post office all within walking distance of the hotel.

It is on the charming and relatively quiet l\u2019Ile St Louis and within easy reach of Batobus and Metro stations and a short walk away from Notre Dame and St Germain des Pres and the Marais district. There are pleasant little restaurants on the doorstep although a 10 minute walk will take you off the island and to cheaper ones. The Staff; unfailingly pleasant and helpful. The Hotel: very welcoming and spotlessly clean. There is a lift to all floors but there are still some small and winding stairs to negotiate which could be a problem if you have mobility difficulties or a very large suitcase! The room: I think we had the smallest room in the hotel (looking at the plan in reception) but it was about the same size as our guest room at home and perfectly adequate for sleep and lounging about. The bathroom was small but well appointed. We took tiny suitcases that luckily fitted into the wardrobe but storage of large suitcases would have been a problem. The bed was comfortable. The welcome tray was much appreciated (bring your own milk!). Breakfast: I initially thought 13\u20ac for breakfast was rather a lot but the cafes nearby charged 7\u20ac for an orange juice, hot drink and croissant or bread/toast and butter and jam. Perhaps the hotel breakfast with as much as you can eat and offering a variety isn\u2019t such a bad idea? As long as you can eat that much early in the morning! Romance: Just being here is romantic with the walks by the Seine and the cosy restaurants but if you want to push the boat out.......buy a lock from the souvenir shop on the quay north of Pont l\u2019Archveche and write your names/message on it and lock it onto the bridge; make a wish as you throw the keys in the Seine!

I had always wanted to stay on the beautiful Il St. Louis so for our honeymoon weekend this seemed the perfect time. There are only 4 hotels on the little island. And I thoroughly researched all 4 before choosing Saint-Louis En L'Isle. We booked the \"best\" room at the hotel and explained it was our honeymoon. If someone had told me it was a busy weekend, I would have gladly booked the day prior to our arrival to ensure easy check-in at 6am! The hotel was much smaller than expected (and again, I lived in London for 2 years and have traveled extensively thru Europe, I expected small!) The room at the top of the hotel was clean but the beds were not comfortable (*the bathroom was excellent!) Views were exquisite. Really, we were there for the location so this might have all been tolerable if the service had been more agreeable. Again, I don't expect US standards of friendliness, but we clearly stated it was our honeymoon. NOTHING was done to celebrate - or even acknowledge- this occasion. The most troubling part- whenever we asked the kid at the desk (and he was barely 20 ) to call us a taxi, he'd shrug and say, they are not available. We had to argue with to call other car services every single night. Simply put, there are far better places to stay in Paris.

Background/Context - My husband and I stayed here the last week in February 2011 for 6 nights. We were there when the hotel was just about to add their new facade, so factor in that it was not quite complete but the interiors were done. I recently looked on their website and the updated facade looks great. In my opinion, it now looks a lot nicer than the Hotel de Lutece or Hotel Deux-iles just down the block . After a painstaking review of hotels for this trip, I selected Hotel Saint-Louis en L'isle because of the location and value as they had lower rates compared to the other Ile Saint Louis hotels. I have visited Paris 7-8 times before this trip and have stayed primarily in the 7th Arrondisement and wanted something different. At the time, this hotel was cheaper than the Hotel De Lutece and Deux Isle down the street. With all the renovations, I am thinking it now gives those other hotels stiff competition. It was a hard decision at the time but now realize the value of this Hotel. The Hotel - Besides the wonderful location, it has been renovated as mentioned above. Room renovations are good and fixtures of good quality though rooms are typically your small Parisian size but to be expected in a historic building. I was surprised and very pleased that an electric kettle with complimentary tea/coffee was in the room and that there was a small fridge with (reasonably priced) snacks/drinks. Buffet breakfast was a good value for us at 13 euros as it was \"all you care to eat\" (breads, cold cuts, cheese, eggs, yogurt, cereals, coffee/tea/hot chocolate, jams) and for a small surcharge (3 euro) scrambled eggs, more for an omelet, can also be ordered. I know others think it is too expensive but we like the convenience of just going downstairs to eat before the start of the day and there was protein included; it sure beats just a creme cafe and croissant. Another good point is that the hotel has their own shuttle (very clean with the hotel's decal on the car!) one can book for the airports. No need to pay cash to the driver as the cost of the shuttle will be added to your final bill, we just tipped the driver! Location - The island is packed with tourists during the day. The main street, Rue Saint-Louis, can seem like Las Vegas Boulevard during the day. At night, yes, that is when it becomes all yours and you can stroll around without the crowds for the most part. It has the feel of a little village with its own bakery (only one at the time but I think there is usually 2 bakeries), restaurants, bank/atm, post office, local church. Oh, there is a self-serve laundromat in the center of the island (I forget the exact location) but I noted that for future reference. I liked the selection of reasonably priced Salon de The (favorite is Cafe Med) and our favorite restaurant, Relais De L'isle, down the street where we ate there twice. I am going to write a review for them as well, I agree with their high rating on Tripadvisor. This location is convenient to both Metro and RER lines....you can take the lines on the Marais side (Line 7 - Pont Marie or Sully-Morland), Rive Gauche side (line 4 Saint-Michel) and Il de la Cite (line 4 - Cite). With both Metro and RER close, how central can you be? We took the RER from CDG straight to Saint Michel stop and walked to the hotel, we travel light and are fit so not a problem for us.

I booked the hotel as part of a surprise trip to Paris for my wife, and had decided to book our room through the hotel's website instead of a travel website. In doing so, I was in constant contact with the hotel staff long before we ever arrived. I was very pleased that all of my emails were answered quickly, with the information I requested everytime. Upon arriving in Paris, we were met by the Hotel's shuttle service. The driver was very friendly, spoke English very well, and helped us with our baggage. This was well worth the money, as CDG is farther out of Paris than I had originally thought. The driver took us right to the front door of the hotel, and helped carry our bags into the front lobby where we were met by the friendly hotel staff. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. They were able to help with directions,provide suggestions on where to eat, and even went out of his way to help us find a restaurant which specializes in raclette. (thanks again!) The rooms are very nice, and I believe remodeled recently. The bathrooms are much larger than I expected in a Paris hotel, and include a large walk in shower. Lastly, the hotel's location is amazing. On our first day, after setting our bags down, we exited the hotel and headed left. After walking down the first narrow street on the left, we were surprised to find ourselves staring at Notre Dame. Located on the Islands, you are in a perfect location to set off to anywhere in the city, with several metro stops (and metro lines) within walking distance. Additionally, contrary to what we read, we found several great meals on the Island! You do not have to walk far to find everything from crepes and pastries to full fve course meals! Thank you again to everyone at the Hotel Saint-Louis en I'lsle for helping make our stay in Paris very enjoyable. Several thoughts I think will help: - I highly suggest the shuttle to and from the airport. It certainly made getting to and from the airport much less stressful. Remember to book, and reconfirm, it ahead of time. The shuttle is added to your bill which makes it easy to pay. - My wife and I read in several places that finding a good place to eat on the Islands is difficult. I would highly suggest trying some of the restaurants there. We found several on the street the hotel is on, and the main intersecting street that were delicious and not budget busting! - Utilize the breakfast at the hotel when venturing out to one of the tourist sites. I quickly found that 13 Euros was not unreasonable in Paris, especially for the amount of food you get. Additionally, eating a big breakfast allowed us to avoid to over priced tourist traps near or in the sites. - the hotel has an IPAD, free Wifi, and a computer and printer downstairs for guests to use.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corona, California", "Title": "\u201cWhat a pleasant hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Patricia J", "ReviewID": "UR121025576", "Content": "We traveled with our child to this marvelous hotel and we booked a Top floor room for 3 persons.

The reservations person (Dennis) was my first contact. Very friendly and always nice. However, I requested two rooms since we had three adults traveling. He told us that he had the two rooms for all but the first night. He insisted that a \"triple\" room would be a good solution and that it would fit three adults so we went with it. Mistake#1. The room was extremely small and could barely fit two people comfortably so for american standards skip the triple room and always get the extra room if more than 2 adults. For children may be appropriate. Nevertheless the second night we got our 2 rooms as promised and it was a lot better. The rooms are tiny compared to american standards but very modern and very clean. However, the air conditioner in my room was not functioning. Since it was November, I thought it would not be a big deal. Mistake #2. The room was never really hot as long as you kept the nice breeze coming through window. However, the location of the hotel, although excellent, has is weaknesses. Expect a lot of late night drunk people walking by singing in French, which is cool only when you are drunk and singing along. If you are trying to sleep then you need to close the window and guess what... No AC. It was not a big issue but I would had not gone along with it in the summer heat. Again with th staff: Dennis counterpart was an older man who spoke French, English, Spanish and then some. He was such a nice man. Always very helpful and had a lovely personality. He is the reason why we decided not to complain about any of our issues. The cleaning lady was also very friendly and appeared to do a good job.The rooms were tiny but very pretty. THe bathrooms small were very modern and spotless. Now my biggest issue with the hotel will hopefully be a transient one and relates to the remodeling. there were nosies of a hammer heard as early as 9am sometimes and that was not pleasant to wake up to during vacation. I think the hotel overall is very nice and I would stay here again as long as the remodeling is done and over with (and the AC works). The breakfast is not good in any way so forget about spending 12 Euros on it when you have amazing food shops surrounding you which are a lot cheaper. The location is unbeatable and the staff are lovely but noise was bothersome at times. I recommend this hotel but would call ahead and make sure you get what you want in a vacation. The price appeared reasonable for the wonderful location (140 Euros) but if this goes up the so should the experience (ie NO NOISE).

It was very unusual for it to be that hot in Paris in May. Our room on the third floor was stiffling. We tried in vain to turn on the air conditioning. When we inquired at the front desk, they simply said that the air conditioning is never turned on until June. They weren't very apologetic about it either. Our first night I was so hot that we had to open the windows ,,, the only problem with that is that the narrow street where the hotel is located reverberates with noise. Honestly, you can hear each person cough. It was a holiday in France that day and so people were partying and the street was loud well into the night. I didn't sleep the entire night and came downstairs to talk to the front desk clerk and burst into tears. I am not trying to be dramatic here but I do have to say it is the worst night's sleep I've ever had in a hotel. It just wasn't what I pictured at all. I had to beg for a fan and they made a big deal about the manager bringing over two fans - one for us and one for our daughter;s room. Lucky for us the weather cooled off after the first two days we were there. Otherwise, I don't know if I'd have gotten any sleep and we were staying there for an entire week as we were visiting our son who is studying In Paris for four months. I guess if it was stiffling hot and loud for just one night, you could put up with it but for a whole week ... it just didn't seem like we got what we had hoped for out of our hotel. The other problem is that the place is under construction. Loud banging all day long ... even on the weekend. If you want to come back to your hotel to rest, you can forget about it. There is construction dust and the carpeting on the stairs is disgusting from all the construction traffic. I complained to the front desk clerk and they didn't offer us anything for our inconvenience.

The new room was very nice and finished to high standard with a king sized bed, it was an extra bonus to find that all the refurbished rooms are also fitted with an ipod/iphone docking station and flat screen TV with BBC world news.

We booked this hotel online for 5 nights and checked out after we muttled through the first. We had reserved two rooms for my husband and myself and our 15 and 21 year old children. We travel several times a year and are very experienced travelers and really appreciate small, boutique style hotels. When we first checked in Bernard spoke with us and gave us a room on the 4th floor and one on the 5th floor. I explained to Bernard that I am claustrophobic and therefore I would rather take the stairs as opposed to the small lift. He gave me the key to the room on the 5th floor and after climbing 5 flights of stairs I put the key in and realized that clearly I was in an occupied room (it was a mess), so I walked back down 5 flights of stairs and Bernard was speaking with my husband and I told him what had happened and he actually responded \"yes, sometimes I try to be funny but I'm not! I couldn't believe anyone would give such a response. So I once again hiked up the 5 flights of stairs. My husband later told me that the people that had the room I walked in on had come in while I was upstairs and asked if they could please get their key and he told them \"he couldn't give it to them because he had just given it to somebody else!\" It was unbelieveable. There was NOTHING quaint or charming about it. The carpet, walls and bedspreads were filthy. The furniture was not \"antique\", it was old, junk! The bed broke everytime our daughter sat on it (she weighs 120 lbs). The bathrooms were the only acceptable thing because they had been renovated. In the bathroom the only amenity provided was something our kids nicknamed \"Soapoo\" because it was some multi-purpose soap/shampoo, (probably toilet cleaner also) in a pump bottle. The only reason we stayed at all was because we checked in on New Years eve and we didn't know where else to go at the last minute. When we came in at the end of the night there was some guy (not an employee) lying on a mattress with the door open in a sloppy room just off the reception area, he rolled over and mumbled something and rolled back over and finished watching t.v. We enquired about the early checkout policy and Bernardsaid he couldn't respond and that we needed to speak with his co-worker. After going out New Years Eve we came in and asked the night deskclerk the same question and he said there was no problem, you pay for the night you stay. Needless to say, the following morning we got up and prepared to leave. When I called downstairs in the morning about checking out I spoke with a different person who got quite upset about us leaving. I conveyed to him what we had been told, he was very rude, we paid for our one night and left. We didn't know where we were going but we knew we were leaving that hotel! Twenty years ago my husband and I backpacked through Europe as broke students and we wouldn't have stayed in this dump back then. This is nothing more than a \"flophouse\". In the end it worked out fine, after walking a few blocks with our bags we got a cab and checked in to the Four Seasons for the next 4 nights. Now that it's over and we only stayed one night we all look back and laugh like hell at the dump and the crazy guy. The kids will always remember the \"Soapoo!\" What we have learned is that there are several hotels with similar names so make sure you book the hotel you mean to book (confirm the address) **THIS HOTEL ADDRESS IS ...75 rue St-Louis-en--I'IIe (4th Arrondissement). I also read the review in the Frommer's Paris 2008 book and it is extremely misleading. It is in no way a \"charming family atmosphere\" and as for offering baby-sitting...you would have to be crazy. I do regret that we did not think to take photographs because the photos we have seen didn't look anything like our 2 rooms.

After reading Trip Advisor reviews, we were mixed as to stay here or not. We decided to chance it because the sheer amount of hotels that Paris has to offer is quite frankly overwhelming. We had our expectations set very low, not expecting the Athenne or George V but not a rat trap either. We arrived before 11 am on the day of our checkin after a \"red-eye\" flight from Dallas. We were warmly greeted and given the key to our room immediately! The reviews were right regarding the lift, it is small, but who cares, we took 2 trips with our luggage. We booked the top floor room, #51, and it was large for Paris standards. A double bed, 2 chairs, a desk, small closet, and an enormous bathroom with a tub that 2 people could fit in and you could still get 2 people ready at the same time in the bathroom. The room was extremely clean, the bed was very comortable (I slept the best I had in a year considering we have 3 little ones at home 5 yrs of age and under!), and it had to small step out balcones, one off the bathroom and one off the bedroom. The bedroom balcony offered a view of the Pantheon (which was gorgeous at night) and the Seine. Maid service came every day with fresh towels and tidying up the room. Oh, and the hot water (steaming) and water pressure were to die for after a long day of sightseeing! The Ile Saint Louis itself is a quaint little island with a couple of great brasseries, an amamzing crepeire and bakery (both directly across the street from the hotel!) We slept with the windows open every night because the island is so quiet at night (even after the island literally fills up on the weekend with Parisians shopping). One night there were some noisy drunkards wandering up and down the street, but we simply shut the window and could not hear a thing. We never saw another guest during our stay or heard another guest, though the walls appear to be rather thin, even though the hotel was full. Bernard at the front desk was extremly helpful with dinner reservations (Bofinger Restaurant) and even walked us around the corner of the hotel to give us a quick history lesson of the Pantheon on the hill and his favorite church, St. Etienne du Mont. He would even grab a map and draw the route we should take or Metro stop to go. EXTREMELY helpful overall was the entire staff. It is pretty bare bones, no mini bar, no room service, no Hermes bath products (only a combo soap in a squeeze bottle was offered), no amazing decor. But we paid 220 euros a night and felt we paid a fair price, as for the location (right across the bridge from Notre Dame, and the other direction across the bridge from Hotel de Ville, and several Metro Stops really close and the Les Cars Rouge bus stops right at Notre Dame, the cleanliness and it was an extremely safe area (no urine smelling dark alley entrance here!). We are already planning our next trip back and would defintely stay here again, though we did fall in love with the 6th arrondisement, St. Germain de Pres, and might give that area a stay.

I have been shying away from booking the Hotel Saint Louis due to the mixed reviews. But since there were a few positive recent reviews I decided to take a chance and I am glad I did. First of all the hotel's lobby is small but has enough seating for two antique chairs and a white leather sofa which is dirty looking and not appropriate, in my opinion, to match the ancient building the hotel is in. My room (#42) on the fourth floor was cosy but had enough room for a desk and chair plus enough walking room around the bed area. Fortunately it was a corner room so I had the advantage of having two large French windows which led to a small balcony which is really not useable. It's much too narrow to wander onto that balcony for safety reasons. Yet it was nice to have a balcony!

Tatty, old, faded bedspreads which are orange colored. They should be changed (one bedspread in 3rd floor room I had a choice of getting had a noticeable hole) immediately as they look awful. Extremely small regular double rooms as the bed takes up practically the entire room. Very very tiny bathrooms. For example, in my bathroom one could literally use the toilet and wash one's hand at the same time. Wall shower attachment is not adjustable. Hotel provides no soap except bottles of liquid soap that's meant to be used for multiple uses as soap, shampoo, and bath foam. Yuck.

I very much recommend it!", "Date": "October 12, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Saint-Louis en l'Isle", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d219996-Reviews-Hotel_Saint_Louis_en_l_Isle-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$225 - $319*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">75 rue Saint-Louis en l'Ile</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75004</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "219996", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f3/c5/97/chambre-room.jpg"}}
