It was spacious, clean and bright. Two family members spent 2 nights with us on the pullout queen sofa in the livingroom and said it was very comfortable, We had a king sized bed with a jacuzzi in our room. One of the best features is the screened in porch area, which had two entrances, one from the living room and one from the bedroom. How peaceful it was out there. We didn't have a car until our other family members came back, but had no trouble getting around. We were in the building fartheset away from the main pool area, but they have golf cart sized shuttles to pick you up or drop you off. where-ever you wanted to go on the grounds. This was so helpful as my husband was recovering from surgery. All you had to do was to call for it. Also right outside the main gate was the trolley stop, which could take you all up and down International Drive. We took it twice to go to two different restaurants, as there are none with-in walking distance. There is a 7-11 on the corner, though. If you're a senior, it only cost 25 cents one way for the trolley. The drivers are very helpful. We also had a large pizza and salad delivered from the on site deli one night. It was big enough for two meals for the 2 of us. We just relaxed by the pools, took walks, and enjoyed the activities going on. There is a really nice walk around the lake, and a free bus shuttle to SeaWorld, Aquatica, and Universal, which runs quite frequently.

They have a free shuttle to Sea World, Discovery Cove, and Aquatica, or you can just walk. They have shuttles to other theme parks, but it is $9 a person and cheaper to park your rental car at the park. Our room was a studio with a king bed.

It was conveniently located between the two. The only problem with location we saw was that there wasn't very many off site restaraunts near by. You had to go several exits away to find food offsite. That wasn't a problem because the food on property was delicious. We ate at the Coral Reef restaraunt at least 6 of the 7 days we were there. The resort was right across the street from SeaWorld, and Is now associated with SeaWorld. So there are some advantages when you go to SeaWorld, but I can't speak of that specifically because we did not have time in our busy schedule to go there. The main pool deck has so much to offer for families, and they even have daily programs for young and old. You could easily spend your entire vacation at the Grand Vacations club and skip the pricey theme parks and never get bored. I wish we would have had more time to enjoy the programs they offered. The rooms are nicely appointed, but I was surprised that they hadn't been upgraded. The beds were comfy enough, but I was expecting more. We had stayed at their sister resort, The Hilton Grand Vacations Club on International Drive a few years back and their beds were the most comfortable bed I had ever slept in away from home. And while these were decent, they had some wear to them, and just weren't quite what I was expecting. We had some plumbing problems in our room, and maintenance was there in no time at all.

I can only wish that we could have stayed longer. We will definitely return for a much longer stay in the near future. We had booked a room for 2 adults and 1 child. Upon our arrival we were given a 2 bedroom suite. Our 2 bedroom suite was nicely located and well set up. In the master bedroom we had a comfortable King sized bed with nicely appointed furniture. The key feature in this room was the multi-person Jacuzzi bathtub. The housekeeping staff had made swans from the towels and face clothes and placed them on the ledge that separated the room from the bathing area. There was a large counter in the bathroom, and a nice sized shower. In the 2nd bedroom there were 2 comfy queen sized beds with plenty of drawer space. There was a small wet bar with a fridge. The bathroom was a suitable size with a tub/shower combination. The two bedrooms joined to the living/kitchen area. There was a pull out sofa a large dining table that seated 6 people, and a full kitchen with appliances nicer than most people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s homes. Full size fridge with ice maker, a nice ceramic top stove, blender, toaster and any kitchen utensil or pot/pan you would need to feed your family. This kitchen was as well stocked as a regular family kitchen. Impressive! There were a few comfy chairs that you could curl up in to watch tv on the flat screen tv with a dvd player attached. Off both bedrooms and living room was a screened in balcony. This was great as we could sit out in the evening and not worry about mosquitos while we ate. We used the pool near our room. We were staying in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Devonshire Building\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This was a good walk to the main lobby, but we never walked we always took a car. There was a large pool, hot tub, kiddie paddle pool and many loungers. There was also a ping pong table, and plenty of shaded areas to sit under if you want to avoid the sun. There were 2 beautiful pools located off the main lobby area. They had a water fall and lots of open space. Nicely laid out. We did not have time to use these pool unfortunately. The main lobby was nicely designed and there was a sitting area for one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enjoyment. It even housed a piano and a guest was playing beautifully when we went in. There is a deli/shop that sold everything from sun block to food and wine. If you needed anything you could surely find it there. The grounds were beautiful, clean and enjoyable. We had previously stayed at Parc Soleil by Hilton Grand Vacation, and had hoped to get back into that resort. Upon booking we were afraid that SeaWorld resort would not measure up. We were pleasantly surprised and have realized that both resorts are fantastic and worth staying at. We will book HGV SeaWorld again for sure. For those of you who are worried about location, this is an ideal location if you have a car. You are walking distance to SeaWorld, and just down the road from Aquatica and Discovery Cove. You are a 7 minute drive to shopping at the Premium Outlets at Vineland. 10 minutes to Downtown Disney and 12 minutes to Magic Kingdom. You are not far from Universal Studios and located near enough to International drive to hop the trolley and tour around the attractions on I-drive. If you are traveling with family, children or extended family and need space to spread out.

Perhaps some of that is attributable to the low occupancy during down season, but when the only complaint I can possibly come up with after seven nights with kids, in-laws, and the whole ringamarole of an Orlando/Disney vacation is that I wanted a little more water pressure in the master bath shower, that's pretty good.

The Pool Area is great with two large pools, two Hot Tubs, and a few kiddie pools for the Tots. The pool area also has outdoor Ping Pong and a Pool Table which makes a nice afternoon of recreation. The highlight of the Pool Area was the two waterfalls (one drops into the pool and the other into a hot tub). This gave the pool area a luxury feel which makes you feel like you are at a top notch facility. Now the Bad We stayed in a one bedroom unit that was advertised as a one bedroom unit with kitchen facilities. The unit was smaller then 90% of the standard hotel room around the country. The bathroom was so small that you had to wedge yourself between the toilet and the Sink in order to close the bathroom door when using the shower or toilet. It was not as bad as a cruise ship bathroom but it was close. Simply making the door open outwards would have been a big improvement. The kitchen facility was not a kitchen at all, it was a small bar sink, a microwave, and a coffee machine all placed on a 2 foot section of counter top with a mini fridge under. There was no room to prepare meals, no stove, no dish washer, and most importantly no eating area in the room. We planned to prepare a few meals during our stay but that was completely out of the question. In addition, because this is a vacation club, they do not supply housekeeping during your stay, that means, nobody changes the sheets, refreshes the towels, vacuums the floors, etc.. We were only their for four nights but if you are going to give me a hotel room rather then a traditional timeshare condo/apartment unit, you should at the very least service the unit like a hotel room. The condition of the room was in good repair but getting alittle tired. It may need an update soon but nothing serious. The grout in the bathroom was clean but stained due to massive use and age. The carpet was clean but slightly worn. Overall the Room had the feel of a Fairfield or Hampton Inn without the House Keepting. Small, No Luxury Appointments but Clean.

We were excited for this trip & were not disappointed with this Hilton. This is the 3rd HGVC we have stayed in, both the other ones being in Vegas, this one was a little older but very nicely appointed & kept up. We stayed in Sandy House which was not remodeled as yet but it was a busy week due to a convention near by & even though we asked for a the remodeled rooms closer to the main pool area, they were not able to accommodate us at check in. It was clean, comfortable & had everything we needed for the week. We stayed on the 5th floor, asking for the top level but were again told that the top of the condo was unavailable to give to us. We had people above us two of the nights & either they were incredibly noisy or the floors have no sound barrier. We stayed with 4 adults & 2 children, had plenty of room with a full kitchen, dining room, living room, 3 full bathrooms, the master had a King, one spare had a queen & the second had two queens. Our master had a jacuzzi tub which we used one night. We had two balconies but they just looked at the other buildings. The TVs were not flat screened or large but we weren't there for that so it didn't bother us. The beds were very comfortable & the kitchen had everything we needed to cook & eat with. The staff was very nice & helpful. The grounds were very well kept. The two main pools were never too crowded, plenty of empty chairs for lounging & both were warm. There were many outdoor jacuzzi tubs that were never crowded either. Nice to relax in after long days at the parks. They had a pool table which we played on one night.. There was a play ground, tennis courts, basketball courts, movie theater & activity center. They had many activities the week we were there but our kids did not participate in any of them because we kept them busy with the amusement parks. We all enjoyed the pools several times during our stay. Our condo was three building away for the pools & we used the gulf carts 3/4 of the time. Out of the numerous times we called during our stay, there were two times that we called & no one showed to pick us up. We ate at the restaurant next to the pool, Coral Reef Bar and Grill, twice during the week & were very impressed with the price & taste of our meals. My mother-in-law has several allergies & the chef came to our table to assure she got the food she could eat. We were most impressed with our waiter both nights, Igor, he was exceptional. We have been on many cruises & although he told us he had never worked for one, he truly knew how to take care of his customers, making us feel like royalty. The location is superb! We used the shuttle for Seaworld. It was always on time & money saving to not have to pay to park. We had a rental car & also drove around as well, there are plenty of places to eat & shop in the area as well. Right off the highway, it made it easy to get almost everywhere we went. We used the free quick pass for Seaworld & it was a nice touch to have it for free because we stayed here. We went the night before we would go *& they would print out passes to had in for our bands at the park. We were asked to have the timeshare breakfast only once when we checked in, we said no & never heard about it again. We would love to stay here again. Would really like to see the remodeled rooms.

We were invited to a timeshare presentation in return for a cheap 4 day break at this location. We paid $250. My wife and I had considered taking an investment in HGVC, but after the experience in Orlando this is firmly on hold. \u00c2\u00a0We attended the presentation on the morning after the day we arrived, so had not had any opportunity to experience the resort, and this was one of the reasons we didn't purchase at the presentation. More on this later! We were give a room in the 'Sandy' block on the 5th floor. \u00c2\u00a0The two bedroom suite was appointed well, albeit tired and in need of some refresh. \u00c2\u00a0The TVs are really showing their age, and the fan didn't function on the balcony. \u00c2\u00a0As Florida had a cold day, by its standards, we chose to switch on the room heat. \u00c2\u00a0On doing so the room filled with a burning smell, and the smoke detectors went off, emitting their high pitch wail for some 10 minutes, even though I immediately switched off the heating. \u00c2\u00a0We notified reception, but no one ever came to examine the system, reception seeming to be content with their question \"is it OK now sir?\". I guess this means they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean them very often so they are full of dust - wheeze! This room is located directly opposite the elevator, and this gave rise to constant droning from the elevator motor room until late at night, and again from early morning. \u00c2\u00a0I guess someone has to have the room next to the elevator, but if you stay here make sure you check where the allocated room is. The room we had also backed onto another block, and when sitting on the balcony you have the great humming noise of the 6 stories of air conditioning units cooling the opposite block. This is a very poor design, as our 5th floor room had an OK view over the garden and tennis courts, but the din from the airco units ruined any idea of a quiet glass of wine at sunset. The in room WiFi work intermittently, and suffered slow speed and signal loss on a continuos basis. \u00c2\u00a0It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also one of those systems where every time you want to get online you have to open a browser and agree Ts&Cs before you can surf etc. Get\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tiresome after the first few times. Our check out day was Sunday, but on the Saturday we returned from a day out at 530pm to find the room had not been cleaned, and everything was as we had left it. \u00c2\u00a0I immediately called reception who said they would send someone. \u00c2\u00a045 minutes elapsed at which time I lost my patience and walked to reception and spoke to the duty manager. \u00c2\u00a0He apologised and said he would attend to it immediately. \u00c2\u00a0Another 30 minutes elapsed before a cleaner showed up. \u00c2\u00a0We left for a drink at the bar while she serviced the room. \u00c2\u00a0This really is exceptionally poor service for a supposedly top end Hilton resort. We took breakfast on the morning of checkout, and this was yet another disappointment to add to the list. \u00c2\u00a0We were served by 'Abby', a rather stern Eastern European young lady, who insisted on wearing very large sunglasses so that her face was partially covered. \u00c2\u00a0We were eating indoors. \u00c2\u00a0 Abby seated and attended to two suited Japanese gentleman who had arrived after us, took their drinks orders, and then found the time to bring us menus. \u00c2\u00a0When she eventually came back with our drinks (this location also does not offer sweet tea to the annoyance of my American wife), she took our breakfast order. After 25 minutes of waiting we noticed that the gentleman who had queue jumped with Abby's assistance had been served their food, but then to our astonishment so had a family who arrived some 10 minutes after us, even though two of their party had arrived some time after the first two, and before anyone had placed their orders. \u00c2\u00a0 When we eventually managed to attract Abby's attention she brushed it off as they didn't order an omelette, and this is why we had to wait! \u00c2\u00a0Throughout service she appeared uninterested in us, abrupt, and quite frankly annoyed with having to work. \u00c2\u00a0She had her apron stuffed with check folders, and when she gave us our check, she put down a pile of dirty dishes next to us while she went through the stack of check folders to locate ours. After finalising our packing we loaded the car and drove round to reception to obtain a final account folio. \u00c2\u00a0We were told the computer system was down and therefore they could not provide an account at this time, but they would email me one as soon as their systems were working again. \u00c2\u00a0Three days later and I'm still waiting. After 1 week of waiting I had to call HGVC and then go through the hassle of filling in a form sent via email, printing, signing, scanning, and emailing it back to be sent a text file (not formatted at all) of my account charges. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even mention the illiterate way the email was written to me. I have also had to arrange to have my car detailed due to the hotels sprinkler system that sprays water all over parked cars in the parking spaces. \u00c2\u00a0My car is only 4 months old, and after being sprayed was covered in water stains that will not wipe off with simple washing, and has left large spots all over the paint. \u00c2\u00a0It seems the water has a high calcium content. \u00c2\u00a0In any event, those of us who use their own cars don't want to have to clean this mess off everyday. \u00c2\u00a0 The Hotel employs a large contingent of Eastern Europeans and Russians, and while I have worked with many during my career, I can say with certainty that those staff members at this location fail to meet the usual American standards of service normally expected and experienced. This is a mid grade resort running on a limited budget, and with limited service standards. I am a Hilton Diamond Elite, and therefore expect a certain level of service from Hilton when I stay. I am not a budget traveller and do not expect a budget service when staying with Hilton. I guess if you want a place to let your kids run wild while you get drunk, this will work out fine. On the timeshare presentation. We had a sales manager who was not pushy or unpleasant in anyway, but he did make one or two comments that were unsavory. When telling us no one could offer us the incentives to purchase again if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy there and then, he used an analogy that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if one of our African American friends complained that we got special treatment, Hilton would be in all sorts of trouble, so they had to apply the rules universally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also kept referring to Paris Hilton in numerous disparaging remarks. I may not be a fan of hers, but this is not what I expect to be listening to. I have written to Hilton to highlight this unacceptable behaviour, and am awaiting a response. Despite his obviously unacceptable comments we did discover that Hilton can, and will offer similar incentives if we attend another presentation at another location, or at the same location a year later. Also the mathematics they use to convince you to buy are misleading and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d urge anyone going on one of these timeshare trips to do some Google searches ahead of time and arm yourself with the facts. Especially the charges made to use the points you purchase at other properties, and to exchange them for HIlton Honors points. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t represent such good value. The interest rate if you purchase on finance is also 12% at the time of writing for a 10 year finance agreement. Make sure you can finance this yourselves before attending. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much for less than $18K, just in case you were wondering, and the top tier costs $175K.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Augustine, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting!\u201d", "Author": "MissMouse1928", "ReviewID": "UR120707488", "Content": "This was my first stay at this hotel and it will absolutely be my last.

The light fixture in the dining area and the ceiling fan in the bedroom had cob webs all over them. The bathroom was the worst of all. The shower had someone else's hair in it indicating that either it had not been cleaned since the last guest or it was not thoroughly cleaned. The condition of the tile surrounding the exterior bottom of the shower was awful. It was in disrepair, dirty, appeared wet at all times. The light switches were dirty and discolored. The cabinets and drawers were very shabby. The interior of the bathroom drawer had peeling paint and it was dirty and definitely not a place where you'd want to put your things. The hair dryer had a black dirt mark on it. The jacuzzi tub had hair in and around the jets and did not appear clean in general. I wouldn't step a foot in there. The screened patio was so overgrown with trees/plants that you could barely see daylight, I didn't go out there. On the third day of my stay, my room was never cleaned. I have no idea why. Staying in this room was nauseating but I had a very busy schedule and when I attempted to find another hotel to move to, I could not find a room so I cleaned every surface I had to touch using disinfectant wipes and reluctantly stayed.

First, and most important, every staff member with whom I spoke or came into contact was very courteous, professional, efficient, effective and generally performed their duty with cheer. I was shocked by this. Isn't that sad? We have come to expect so little from people in service industry. I was very pleasantly surprised. The location is great. You are literally across the street from Sea World. You can walk there. You are a short drive from the airport and all the Disney attractions are a short drive away. The farthest park, Magic Kingdom, was exactly 12 minutes away. I definitely recommend renting a car if you plan to stay here. The rooms were very clean. I am very, very picky when it comes to cleanliness and I do not have a single complaint about this resort. Ask my husband. I can *always* find something about which to complain and like to lament, \"if only\" and \"next time.\" No such regrets or complaints this time. We were very well-stocked with towels and additional bed linens, blankets and pillows and felt very comfortable. The kitchen was also very well-stocked with dishes, cookware, utensils, and even had a pitcher. We didn't really cook much, but we did make eggs a couple of times and ate cereal, made coffee and a pitcher of pink lemonade. We had everything we needed. My one suggestion is to buy your own coffee and basket filters, as the complimentary 2-in-1 coffee and filter combo there tasted horrid. Perhaps I used too much water, but I ran to the local Publix and made my own coffee after that. At home we sleep on very firm mattresses. These beds are very soft. I initially worried that we would hate it. I slept so well that I wonder if my next mattress might be a pillow-top. My husband and I both had really great nights of sleep. We had a 2 bedroom suite and had plenty of room to spread out with 3 small boys. The resort has several pools and hot tubs. The boys loved the playground and playing ping pong. We did not eat in the restaurant, so I can't comment on that, but there is a restaurant on site. There is also a small convenience store where I purchased a gallon of water (that FL tap water is the worst!) and some beer. It is very expensive, so I don't recommend buying much there. Rent a car, make a trip to CVS on the corner or Publix for your essentials, but the store is there in case you are in a pinch. It seems that some of the rooms have been updated recently. Ours was not, it was pretty 90s-tastic, but it was still tasteful and clean. No complaints. Clean, lots of room to spread out, proximity to area attractions and great customer service.

The hot tubs were a bit on the warm side for my tastes, but otherwise, everything was nearly perfect. I highly recommend visiting this facility.

We were there to 'do' Universal. Side note- I'd recommend (if you're driving) to take Turkey Lake Rd instead of I-Drive to Universal. You'll shave off 4-5 stoplights & a ton of time if you're going during rush hour. It took us less than 15 minutes (there's also a WalMart on TL road if you need to stock up) from car door closing to being parked in Universal. Back to the hotel- we got there around 6pm on Sat. & were 2nd in line to check in and waited about 20 minutes. It took forever & the line piled up behind us!! I didn't stop to pickup my 'free gift' b/c I didn't want to wait anymore!! Then we were told one of our rooms wasn't ready, but when we got up there it appeared to be done. We were in Somerset building & had a 2 bedroom. Now this turned out to be 2 one bedroom units with king beds in each room. I say this b/c we ended up having to sleep on the sofabed!! If you need 3 beds + couch for a two bedroom, I'd be sure & ask for it. The person at the desk was less than helpful about listening to my request for an extra bed- so we made the best of it. The rooms were nice & looked updated- flat screens in each room & the dining room had a large table (more than enough to fit 5 of us) 4 chairs and a large bench. The washer was a good size but the dryer took forever to dry clothes. The kitchen was a little cramped if you wanted more than 1 person in there! The floors were also pretty filthy- not sure if that was the carpets or the tile flooring- we started keeping our shoes on as much as possible. They had a 50 person theatre that had Monday night football & played movies 4 nights (free) & the other 2 nights they had a dive-in movie set up at the pool. The main pools are right next to each other & I counted 4 hottubs- they also played music which was nice. One pool had a fountain in the middle of it the kids liked to play on (5 ft deep in the center) and the other had the waterfall. They also had a kiddie splash area. There's a small nice workout room & the treadmills have TV's on them. Shuffleboard, large chess set, covered playground, ping pong & pool table round out the pool area. We walked around & noticed a basketball court & tennis court. They also have another pool (adult only?) in one of the buildings that's further away from the main area. (If you don't have kids, you may want to request that area?!) It looked like a lot of renovations were going on. Several bldngs were blocked off & had lots of boxes outside of them. A note about the staff: a couple times I called down to the desk for various questions, the person who answered just didn't have a clue & had to keep being corrected on her answers. Perhaps another week of training will cure that? The pool staff seemed nice, but again, clueless. No one stood out in the helpful department. One other (major?) issue was Tuesday when we came back from the parks, our keys wouldn't work in the room door, but we found that just pushing down the handle opened the door! We deduced the cleaning people had come in to do the rooms (you get one cleaning/week) and forgot to lock the door back up. We stopped someone from security & he got it fixed pretty fast. It didn't look like anything had been stolen. All in all, I'm not sure what to rate this place. If you read my other reviews, I'm pretty easy going & forgiving about other places I've stayed.

As I was planning this vacation, I decided we'd skip the busy crowds and lines at the amusement parks (besides, we've done them all already) and enjoy the vast amenities and activites offered at this resort style hotel. The resort grounds are immaculate. We could see continual care and upkeep being done throughout our stay so absolutely no complaint there. The resort's three pools were also well maintained. And happily there was always enough seating for all three of us each day. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was definitely enough space for our family of three. It was clean and very comfortable. Housekeeping didn't come everyday but then again our needs were few so the days they did ring the doorbell it was right on time. I was a little sad to see that no updates had been done (at least not in the suite we were in) with respect the the decor. The suite had two rather small tube televisions (Not LCD flat screen) and early 90's \"Golden Girls\" furniture. Now, I'm not so much of a hotel snob were this is a major deal breaker for me but with so much building, expansion and lodging competition in Florida it would have been cool to see some updates done since my last stay 7 years ago! Remember, I mentioned I decided we'd skip the amusement parks and instead enjoy the vast activites offered at the resort?? Well, there was a daily schedule of events but none were very much fun or very well attended. Please don't misunderstand, the activities staff is FANTASTIC but the activites just weren't as varied or exciting as I remember them being. My children and I loved the movie theatre and dive-in movies (what happened to the popcorn that used to be offered???) but I can see a movie anywhere. My daughter loved being at the pool but day after day of the SAME THING, she was left asking, \"Mommy, is this all there is?\" My son showed up at the basketball court for activites and was the only one there! This has more to do I think with guests than staff but my guess is if other activities on the schedule were awesome, guest would be excited to attend. This is definitely an area where HGVC needs to be tightened up! Maybe model actitivites after those found on cruise ships. You almost have to be that persistant and perky to get some people amped to participate. So, maybe you're asking yourself, if she didn't love the room decor, if housekeeping didn't show up everday, if the activities weren't all that great and the pools were just ho-hum, why did she score this place a \"EXCELLENT?\" Two words...THE STAFF!!! Each day I drove onto the resort property I was eagerly greeted by front gate reception with a warm smile and \"Welcome Home.\" Every single staff member we passed on the grounds greeted us with a genuinely friendly \"Hello.\" I can't tell you a time where I've checked in/out of a hotel and didn't feel rushed at the front desk and actually enjoyed speaking to the front desk clerks. The activites staff did their best to engage everyone and encourage them to have fun. Sadly, I guess some people go on vacation prefer to be left alone :-( Mind you, I was visiting Florida at a time where back home was expereincing an unheard of 5.9 earthquake and hurricane Irene so I wasn't able to get home when or as planned. HGVC was able to extend our reservation at the same low, low rate we had originally, staff members checked in on us to see if we were able to make arrangements to get home, activities staff were GREAT with my kids. I think they saw I was growing concerned about not being able to get home and didn't want my children to be concerned. This and reasons I haven't listed is why I stayed and will return to HGVC at SeaWorld!!! Next visit, I may incorporate a Plan B for activities though :-) Happy Lodging!!!", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "H.B., California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "cmego", "ReviewID": "UR118001693", "Content": "This resort is large.

Compared to other Hilton properties I have stayed at it is the worst, however that does not mean it is horrible. I stay here because I get an extra 2k points/stay for them not having breakfast available even though I have Diamond status Checking In - If you have HH status it will never be acknowledged during check in. If you have perks because you are Diamond you have to remind them. They don't even recognize you as a returning guest like they seem to be able to do in other properties. The clerks are all polite except for one that checked me in last Sunday at around midnight. Staff - The clerks are very polite but not necessarily friendly. The rest of the staff is very friendly and warm. Rooms - I stay in the basic suites which have a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster and plates/utensils/glasses for 2 people. The walls are thin and you can hear everything from adjoining rooms. The rooms' decor is ugly, I guess what you would expect from a vacation style place. The elevators are horribly slow and there is only one per building so I learned to get rooms on the 1st floor. Most of the rooms have Cleanliness - I'd say about 80% of the time there is an issue. The worst was checking in and seeing hairs all over the bed (and not from the head). Other times you can see wrappers, food that was not vacuumed from a previous stay. I've had rooms with dirty stained towels. I will say that I now look for bedbugs in all hotels and have never seen evidence of these critters in my rooms. Points: It takes forever to get points posted to your HH account and I've had to contact them to resolve missing stays. Other: The hotel is gated but every night some delivery clown is slipping a flyer under my door. On Tuesday night they called the cops on one guy doing that, a maid told me that they can't seem to stop these guys from trespassing and the next day I got a few more flyers.

But an Orlando vacation can get pricey, between park admission, hotel stays and meals. HGVC Sea World provided a great value for our family (mom, dad, teenage son and pre-teen daughter). Now, if you are the kind of person that expects your bed to be made every day and expects fresh towels daily while on vacation, this is probably not the place for you. As a timeshare resort, you only get one full cleaning during a one week stay. But in exchange you essentially get a \"home away from home\" complete with a full kitchen, a washer and dryer and plenty of space for a family at a price far below what you'd pay to stay at a comparable Disney resort. The kitchen was nicely appointed with pretty much all the cooking tools, pots and pans and dishes you'd need. They also provided several packets of coffee and coffee filters as well as several packets of dishwasher detergent and liquid dishsoap. All you needed to do was supply whatever food you wanted! There was a small (but pricey) market on site, which was good in a pinch, as well as a large Publix grocery store about a mile away. This really helped us keep our meal costs down. We did have a couple of lunches at the poolside grille, which had a somewhat limited menu but the food was good and the portions were very large. We also appreciated that the kids had their own bedroom (and they each had their own bed) , with their own bathroom, television and balcony. That allowed some \"quiet time\" for mom and dad, and also meant that if we wanted to stay up but the kids wanted to sleep (or vice versa), it could be done without disrupting the others (which would be a problem if the four of us were staying in a single hotel room). Having laundry facilities in the unit was great -- it allowed us to pack lighter since we could do laundry at any time. They provided one packet of laundry detergent but would provide more upon request. Additionally, there were several pools on site. The two main pools (the waterfall pool and the fountains pool) were clean and had plenty of comfortable chairs to lounge in. There were also some covered areas with tables and chairs where you could eat in the shade. The pools were never crowded and we never had a problem getting chairs no matter what time we arrived at the pool area. They also had several of poolside activities (bingo, dive in movies, hair braiding, water aerobics, occasionally live music) that added to the fun. Additionally, there was a deck that went out over the lake (you could not go in the lake for a reason you will see in a minute), and one of my daughter's favorite things to do was to walk to the end of the dock to see the alligator! Yes, I said alligator. There was an alligator, numerous fairly large turtles, and fish in the lake, and the alligator was quite fun to watch. Also, this property has a partnership with Sea World (which is literally across the street) where you can get a free \"Ultimate Quick Queue\" pass. This is similar to the Disney Fastpass and allows you a separate, go straight-to-the-front-of-the-line pass for the more popular rides at Sea World. You can also buy these at Sea World but I think they cost $20-25 per person. You just have to ask for these at the concierge desk the day before (we never had problems getting one) and it is so worth it! It was pretty hot when we were there (late August) and it saved us $80-100 per day since we didn't have to buy them. There is also a free shuttle (it is more like a city bus than a small shuttle) that goes between this property, a couple other nearby Hilton properties, and Sea World and Aquatica. We walked to Sea World but did use the shuttle to return to the hotel when it got too hot to walk. You can get the shuttle schedule at the concierge desk and we found that it ran on schedule. We also drove to a couple of the Disney parks a couple of times and found it to be a pretty quick 10 minute drive, and we were always able to find a parking spot close to our building when we returned. My only complaint was that there was one slow and very hot elevator for our building. I wish they would improve the air conditioning for the elevator, and the slow speed would be far more tolerable if it weren't so sweltering inside. Maybe next time we'll ask for a unit closer to the ground level (we were on the fifth floor). Bottom line - this is a great option for a family that wants room to spread out, wants the ability to cook and do laundry to keep costs down, wants to be close to the parks (but doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg for it) and wants to come home at the end of the day to a place where you could relax poolside or join in on some fun activities if you want to.

I'm not too picky but this has to be ranked as poor as it certainly did not live up to expectations. The property is split into several buildings. Ours was far away from the main lobby and pool - so the only time we visited that area was during check in. Our building had well over 100 rooms (could give an exact number), all of which relied on one, very slow, very stuffy and old elevator. I'm not exaggerating when I say it could take 3 or 4 minutes for the one elevator to come. There are only exterior entrances and no interior corridors. The room was sub-par. I would put it slightly below Holiday Inn - not what I would expect from the Hilton brand. It was certainly not comfortable and there was nothing special about it (though a few dishes were provided in the 'kitchenette', but maid service didn't clean the few dirty glasses we used - I guess that's fine, but it was unexpected). There was an extremely noisy air unit in the ceiling that would jolt us awake in the night - and we're hard sleepers. We had asked specifically to stay in the recently remodeled section - don't know if this was, but I hope they don't consider that remodeled. So without going on, you get what you pay for. It was a relatively inexpensive stay, but certainly not what we expected from the Hilton brand.

While I really like the property, I will warn that the Hilton timeshare product is overpriced. You can buy points on the open market for 20-25 cents on the dollar and get the special \"Gold\" status (which is nice) through a Hilton credit card. With that said, we were not pressured to take part in any timeshare promotion, except for a brief pitch when my wife checked in. I think the best comparision is to compare our room to ones we've had at the Disney Vacation Club. We were in a recently renovated room, and I found the Hilton room to be much nicer, although I'm not sure how well it will hold up to heavy use over the next several years. The buildings are six stories high, and as a result everyone gets to be near the pool, bar and so forth; unlike SSR and OKW at Disney, where everything is so spread out that makes everything a real chore. There were two pools, side by side, one with a waterfall. There was no slide. There is a wide sidewalk going around a small lake or large pond. The bar/restaurant had pretty good food. We didn't watch a movie in the movie theater, but there are movies every night. And it's an easy drive to lots of restaurants. Overall we were very happy with our stay. I think they failed to credit us our advance deposit on our bill and we didn't realize it until we left, and we have to work that out. Also, our HHonors points have not posted yet and so we are having to go through the hassle of getting them. But the resort was such a value that I am not holding that against them in my rating. Floridays is a very popular condo resort with a much better location in relation to WDW than this property. But location aside, I rate this property as a much nicer resort.

My only complaints about our unit was the toilet was really noisy every time we flushed it, the balcony we had was right next to the air conditioners for all the units in our building, so when we sat on the balcony the noise was not so pleasant & lastly when we were in the living room area, we could hear the people in the unit next to us through the lock off door. But never heard any noises from the bedroom, so we were at least able to get a restful nights sleep. The main pool was always packed & full of people. We only used it once so our daughter could swim in the kiddie pool, which was actually not as crowded. We walked over to the smaller, quiet pool a few buildings away from ours & it was nice & relaxing with less people. We never used the Marketplace or restaurant/bar so I cannot comment on those.

We flew out of Toronto at 0630 and ended up at the hotel at approximately noon thinking that there was no way that would be able to check in early. We checked with front desk as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re promptly advised that we could check in however there were limited rooms to choose from. The front desk staff took out a map and highlighted the rooms available that that point in time. We asked for and received a renovated room on the first floor of the St. Georges building. Off we went to park the car and to drop off our luggage. The room was well appointed and had a new flat screen tv. The furniture was fairly new and comfortable. The room had a iron and ironing board , safe and some cleaning products tucked away in the closet. The little kitchenette had all the necessary items \u00e2\u20ac\u201c toaster, microwave, coffee maker, mini-fridge, a couple of dishes, cutlery and glasses (including two wine glasses). The washroom was a good size and offered us Crabtree & Evelyn product on a daily basis. The bed and pillows were comfortable however we were a little surprised to find out that the bed was a rather small for what we were told was a queen size bed. Since we were on the first floor the balcony virtually was surrounded by lush vegetation and trees. If we were ever to book again I would opt for a room on a higher level with a view of the beautiful grounds or pool however at the end of the day it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big issue at all since we spent very little time in the room. The room was also located directly across from the elevator. The elevator didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us rather it was the guests waiting for the elevator that caused a little bit of noise but nothing to really complain about..just something you may way to avoid when you chose your room. Grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Staff were always friendly and offered a smile or a quick chat. Main pool was really nice and offered games and activities and was always busy but we never had an issue getting a chair at anytime of the day or evening. We actually preferred the smaller quieter pool for hanging out during the day but would head over to the main pool to watch all the kids have a blast and either have a snack or a drink. The pool area offered table and chairs so you could actually either order food from the restaurant and take to your table or bring your own. Many people grilled at the bbq stations and set up shop close to the pool for family dinners. We also like the fact that you could bring your own beer or wine in with you instead of being forced to buy them from the restaurant. We ordered food from the restaurant on one night and felt it was the equivalent to half decent pub food. Prices for drinks and food was quite reasonable for a hotel. We saw many people ordering the pizza from the pizza shop on site and it looked good. Gym was well equipped for a hotel and was located right near to pool. Hotel was close to everything and parking wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue at all even though they were completely sold out the weekend we were there.

I looked into the negative comments and wanted to react to them, namely the quality and location issues. The property has recently gnoe through quite a few renoations, so when you call for a reservation, simply request an updated room. Location can be a problem, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time doing activities, going to the pool, going to the deli. To remedy this, ask for a building that overlooks the pool. We like Hamilton. Ask for a room that is away from the elevator or near the stairs. You'll walk only a short distance to everything. For the folks who complained about the on-site store and deli not being stocked with a large array of items. I'm not sure what anyone expects from a hotel store. For those used to staying at Disney locations such as the Polynesian or Animal Kingdom, the store here and the deli is equal to the variety you find at those on-site stores and food locations. We stay at them all. BEcause any hotel will overcharge for the convenience of on-site amenities, simply take a drive down the road upon arrival to CVS and the grocery store to stock your room with groceries, drinks, snacks, toiletries, etc. We have never found the store lacking - except for \"odd\" items that not everyone need - ie. Lactaid milk, and the prices are comparable for a resort. They make sandwiches on site and if you don't want something behind the counter, ask for it fresh. They are always accommodating. As far as notes about security and maintenance, I have to say that after 5 stays, we have not experienced this. All travelers need to use common sense, buy a laptop lock, put your items in the safe and don't leave jewelry and valuables around. Heck, items can be stolen from our own homes, so if you think you should leave random valuables around a hotel room, even the Ritz, you are asking to be a victim of petty theft. Security has been great to us -we have lost things, had safe malfunctions, etc., and they come up right away and handle our issues with great professionalism. Maintenance - same thing - we have had TVs replaced with new ones, even asked for a 2nd DVD player, no problems. You can't beat the location. If you have kids who want to enjoy Sea World, go to Disney, Downtown Disney or just hang at the pools, then this property is a treat. It's across the street from Discovery Cove and a stone's throw from Sea World. The pools are typically lukewarm, and movie nights are a treat.

We took a day from the parks and stayed at the pool. It was wonderful. The kids had a ball, great music and games. Popsicles and ice cream, hair braiding. Just plain fun. 2. Deli/Store is well stocked and the prices are decent. 3. Theater - only holds 50 seats and we didn't see a movie but they have one just about every night. 4. Time share but never was asked to sit in on a presentation unless I approached the desk. 5. Provides Sea World Quick Queue passes - nice perk. 6. Liked the restaurant better than the International Drive location. Nice covered area. 7. Walking proximity to Sea World. Cons. 1. Room had some outdated features including tube TV's. Otherwise was ok. 2. Noisy air conditioners on the balconies on the next building. Made sitting on our own balcony not so peaceful. 3. One elevator per building is not enough. We were on the 6th floor and waited on the elevator - a lot. Did use the stairs a bit too. 4. There is a path around the lake but it's not nearly as nice as the path at the International Drive location. Liked being able to walk/jog but really didn't do that at the HGVC Sea World. I have one other complaint. Check in time is 4:00pm. We arrived right at 4pm and was told our room was being cleaned. Checked back in 75 minutes and they said they were still cleaning the room. They apologized profusely. Went shopping and came back 75 minutes later again. The front desk said they were just \"finishing up\" but they would give us the keys. We finally checked in at 6:30pm.

Having a separate bedroom for mom & dad is ideal. -our room was cleaned every day with the exception of one day that rained and we stayed in our suite most of the day, even so we were offered a change of towels or anything else we needed -staff was friendly and super helpful without exception. Tickets for all attractions could be obtained from the travel concierge. We used the shuttle to both Sea World and Universal without incident. The Universal shuttle in particular was a good deal, about half the price of taking a taxi. The Sea World shuttle was free but Sea World is easily accessible by either I Trolley or walking across the parking lot. Location could be both a pro or con depending. We have stayed there twice now without a rental vehicle and have determined that if we went back we'd rent a car. There is really nothing but a drugstore in walking distance. the i trolley is handy and runs regularly but infrequently. Several times we saw the trolley leaving which meant at least a 35 minute wait for another one. This meant that dinners out could take 3 hours or more including travel time. However, the plus of the location is that it is secluded and well removed from the noisiness of the rest of I-Drive. CONS The only real negative was the dining options are limited on site. We arrived at almost 11 pm the first night and the restaurant was closed so we had to order in pizza. Because of the previously mentioned travel times, we would have preferred to eat on site more often but the restaurant seemed to have a much more limited menu than we when we were there 3 years ago. The food quality was adequate though. Overall, we had a great stay once again a the Hilton.

I think it is 3-3.5 star property. Pro's The people were all very nice and friendly. It seems to be a well-managed property. The associates there seem to all be well-trained. The two issues I observed were handled quickly and professionally: 1) Folks smoking in the non-smoking area of the pool, a manager politely reminded them of the rule and directed them to the smoking section and 2) Loud people at 1:30 in the morning, one call to the front desk and they quieted them down. The grounds were meticulously maintained. The main pool area was very nice. It was noisy and busy during the day, so we found a secondary smaller pool towards the back of the property which had a few older folks reading and sunbathing. This is great if you want some peace and quiet. There are several games in the main pool area (ping pong, billiards, shuffleboard) and that was nice. They had a guitar player/singer there during the day, I didn't care for the music but it was a nice thought. The hiking trail around the lake is nice. Folks will come by and take orders for food and drinks, or you can just go to the general store and pick up what you need. The little grocery store in the main building is pretty good. Although the items are priced higher than a regular store, it isn't an all-out gouge that you would expect. If you need a regular store, we found a Wal-Mart supercenter nearby. Maid service was very good, she cleaned out unit and ran the dishwasher each day. The full kitchen in the room was very useful. The screened in patio was nice. I thought the location was great for the tourist-oriented activities we were doing. Con's I read on here to ask for a remodeled room and I did, however either she made an error and put me in an old room or their idea of remodeling is pretty lame. The room was spacious but dumpy and built with poor craftsmanship. If you have seen that program on HGTV \"Holmes on Homes\", Mike Holmes would have a field day with our room. The front door was misaligned and the door handle was loose. This would really be an issue in the summer with heat and bugs. The tiles on the bathroom floor were loose and moved when we walked on them. The toilet PVC supply line went from the toilet into the wall which is not to code. The ceiling fan was wired up backwards. The bed gave my wife and I the worst four days sleep in recent memory. The elevator to our building had a taped cardboard box on the floor (why I have no idea). There was no internet in our room (wired or wireless). I did pick up a wireless signal in the main building. The area has noticeable traffic noise. Summary For the rate I paid for a two-room suite ($149), I thought it was reasonable. I didn't spend much time in the room so it was not too big a deal. I suppose I would not be against staying here again in the future, but we would probably try a different property next time instead.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful ground, inside could be updated, awesome staff\u201d", "Author": "KAS9469", "ReviewID": "UR95096575", "Content": "We stayed here from January 22-29 in a 2 bedroom unit after trading in a time share week.

There are several (I think 10) different hotel buildings; the one we stayed in was quite a ways away from the main reception area. There was no lobby (thus no business center) in the building we stayed in; it is \"courtyard style\" so the exterior door to your room opened to the outdoors. One evening, I woke up about 3:30am to very loud hammering and sawing noises outside my door. As a female traveling by myself, I was quite startled. I called to the front desk who seemed annoyed that their building maintenance man woke me up and said \"I guess I can ask him to continue his routine maintenance in the morning\". ? Very odd - not sure why they were doing that type of exterior work in the middle of the night. Regardless, it was a nice hotel - the rooms were a bit dated but clean.

We have spent our holidays in the Orlando area every year for the last 5 years, either staying at the nearby Sheraton or at the Marriott, which is right next door to the Hilton. Both hotels offer nicer rooms, a nicer hotel site and leisure area, and for less money too! We would recommend both hotels to friends and family. Why did we book the Hilton then? Considering the name Hilton is more prestigious than Marriott or Sheraton, and the rates for the rooms were a lot higher, we expected to get high value for money, we wanted to offer ourselves a little bit of extra-luxury. Bad mistake, the Hilton turned out to be a complete let-down, for these reasons: - the rooms are bigger, but quite spartan in furniture and decoration - housekeeping is terrible, they don't clean anything at all. In 2 weeks stay, they only vacuumed the rooms once, after we complained to the front desk. That was the only time. They don't clean the kitchen, the bathrooms, no vacuum-cleaning, no cleaning of glass surfaces (and there are plenty of those). - the hotel buildings are crammed next to each other, whereas both other hotels offer some nice green space between the much smaller buildings (calmer atmosphere, more relaxation) - due to so many rooms being squeezed into the small site of the hotel, there was more of a spring-break-hotel atmosphere than a family-friendly hotel resort There are many more minor details that simply are better at both other hotels, like staff friendliness when you encounter them on site, or even security (anyone can enter the Hilton hotel area - they don't check anything at front gate), which contribute to the Hilton turning out to be a huge disappointment and making us regret not having booked one of our usual hotels. Actually the only positive experience at the Hilton was the moment between getting out of the car and being greeted by the only friendly staff member we ever met, and getting to the check-in desk (which was manned by a very unfriendly lady): the smiling greeter welcomed us to the Hilton, and told us to go to the ticket desk after checking in, we would receive a welcoming gift from Hilton. Turns out this gift was one of these free coupon magazines you get at every gas stations. That was the first disappointment in what would turn out to be symptomatic for the whole stay at the Hilton. On the day of our checkout we told all of this to the frontdesk manager, and sadly she didn't even look surprised at any of our comments, she was not even upset by the dirty rooms. Is that a tell-tale sign that things are always like this at the Hilton? To sum up, is the Hilton a bad hotel? No, but there sure is a LOT of room for improvement, and there are much better hotels out there for less money.

Upon learning we had missed the last hotel shuttle to Seaworld for that day, Arthur, after escorting us and our luggage to our room, offered to drive us to Seaworld himself. Given our limited time there, that 'extra touch' and his friendly, accomodating manner, was the epitamy of what good customer service is all about.

Unfortunately, that was where our good service ended.

By then, we'd already bathed and it was too late so we updated Adam that the towels were no longer needed.

After stumbling across this HGVC here on tripdavisor.com, and seeing the reviews and the great rates, I decided to take the plunge. My wife, daughter, and I booked for two nights, but decided to drive down a day early and they adjusted our accommodations easily. I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the property. The grounds were fairly lush and well maintained. A manned guard booth at the entrance was a nice touch, although they just lifted the gate and flagged everyone through so it seemed more for show than actual security. The lobby was very clean and modern and the desk staff was very friendly and helpful and got me checked in in less than 5 minutes. Map and key in hand, I drove us to our room. The buildings (or \"houses\" as they call them) were not your standard boring, square buildings. Ours had a nice quasi-courtyard that the rooms surrounded. (see photo) The room was clean and decently appointed. The door opened to a 10 foot hallway that angled back toward the room. The room had a small granite-topped kitchenette (sink, microwave, mini fridge) that was a must with a young child. The furnishings were pretty new and modern, and not at all dated as in many hotels. The room had central heat and air, which worked well (stayed at 71) but was slightly noisy. Luckily the unit was near the door at the far end of the hallway, so it wasn't a big issue. The bathroom was... interesting. It was very large, but had no tub - just a walk-in shower that was only separated by a shower curtain. The bathroom floor wound up splashed with water and a little tricky, but keeping a bath mat just outside the curtain caught most of it. I thought it was a little odd, but the kiddo loved it. After visiting a second room I booked for a coworker and seeing his regular (smaller) bathroom and shower, I cleverly deduced that we were booked in an ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) room. Obviously just an oversight, since the desk claimed there were plenty of vacancies. I notified them, but it was not enough reason to swap rooms unless they needed an ADA room for a worthy guest. Apparently there were several other open ADA rooms. The bed slept fairly well - a little firm for my taste but not at all uncomfortable. They gave five pillows on a \"king\" size bed which was good. I hate being short on pillows, and so many hotels often only give two or three. Note the \"king\" in quotation marks - I put the \"king\" in these quotation marks because the \"king\" size bed we booked and the desk claimed was in the room did not seem like a \"king\" size bed. It was noticeably smaller than ours at home, and was narrower than the headboard. I just chalked it up to the ADA room and the need to provide space for maneuverability. The LCD TV was a nice feature, although becoming pretty common nowadays. The channels were s...l...o...w... to change and were annoying, coupled with the fact that the onscreen channel guide was wrong to the point of showing the entirely wrong channels. With no printed channel listing in the room, and going mad trying to explore the channels with each taking about 2-3 seconds to change to the next, we would up having to call the front desk for channel listings. A very small gripe, and one of the only ones we had. The lobby was adjoined by a nice reading/sitting room with a full grand piano tucked in one corner. On the opposite side of the lobby was the deli/sundries/gift shop with Pizza Hut Express pizzas (a'la Target) and Starbucks beverages. The breakfast was a small selection of pre-prepped items to be loaded into plastic carryout containers and eaten on the balcony outside. The balcony was nice, and overlooked a big, interesting pool with fountain in the middle. (see photo) Not pictured is an extension off of the pool area with a waterfall. A couple of shuffleboards were nearby. Talking to my coworker, I found out that he had stayed here years prior on a borrowed timeshare, and other relatives had a cheap stay scheduled with a requisite timeshare sales presentation. The location was convenient, not far from touristy International Drive with oodles of dining and shopping, the Orange County Convention Center, and several of the theme parks. All in all, it was a pleasant stay and nice property with only a couple of minor complaints. Couple it with only $79/night ($88 after taxes), and I would definitely stay again.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay away from the Crowds\u201d", "Author": "rudeman", "ReviewID": "UR79975790", "Content": "I was attending a conference at the OCCC while my wife, her sister and her husband stayed for pleasure.

The main lobby has a lovely fountain and a small lounge off to the right. When we checked in we were dealt with very politely and courtiuosly. We requested a room on a high floor and close to the main building - Which we got. We had also requested a king bed but when we arrived, we were told we could have a queen bed with a balcony, or a King bed with no balcony. We opted for the queen bed with balcony. Really we should have taken the king as we never used the balcony (as it was tiny!!!) First impressions of the room was good. We were on the 5th floor in the St. George building and the lift was very very slow! We had a nice view over the golf course. Walls are very thin so sometimes it was noisy, but quiet more often than not. Swimming pool area is lovely. It is beside the bar and resorts restaurant. There is also a pool table, ping pong and giant chess. Generally, lots of the family entertainment took place by the pool too. There are 2 hot tubs.....one is boiling so just ba careful of that!!! We only ate twice in the hotels restaurant. Once the food was mediocre and cod, the 2nd time it was much better. Maybe it was just the chef, I dont know! Some small issues that we would have are: - We were out all day and arrived back at our room and it had not been serviced. - We tried to buy some tickets from the Ticket desk, and were pounced on by the timeshare guy. Completely lost the sale because of this. - Buy a LYNX ticket for the duration of your stay as this is more frequent than the I Trolley - The restaurant does not sell breakfast. You have to get this in the deli onsite if need be. Overall we enjoyed our stay here, but felt the resort was definately more for families. The bar/restaurant closes at 11pm.

Everything was spot on and I have to say worth every extra point that we spent for the \"plus\" or penthouse.

The common area facilities were also extensive... being Orlando you don't trully appreciate them as there is too much else to do but there is chess board, ping pong, playground..pools etc.. PLenty to keep the children busy on a late afternoon chill session. One of things that impressed us the most was the level of service. On the second night my hubbie slipped when entering the code for the safe - so when he went to open it he could not get it to open. It was totally our fault. At 7am we called reception because our wallets and theme park tickets were inside and by 7.10am there were two men there to open it for us. We also had an a?c problem in the lockoff third bedroom on day 4 which when they could not get fixed by the end of the day, they removed a window and installed a portable unit, no quibble - which although noisey did the job. They did offer to move us but we refused so they swiftly installed the portable A/C unit - amazing. I have to say we have rarely used Hilton points at Hilton before because the locations are not always confenient so we excahnge for RCI, but I have to say I can now see why the hilton is more expensive.

Anyway, we stayed here 4 nights at the beginning of August 2010. We arrived early and were able to check in (about 1pm, check-in is at 4). We were given a room in Paget. Had requested to not face the pool due to noise and had a room overlooking a golf course, very nice. Close to the private pool as well which we used a lot during our stay. We had a 1 bedroom suite. Lovely! Didn't notice any problems with decor/appliances. Sometimes wifi signal dropped out, usually fine. Though the suite was really big, bed lovely and comfortable, jacuzzi bath fantastic! Balcony a great size and everything we could have needed. Didn't get woken from noise at all, couldn't hear kids or pool or anything. We read we wouldn't get maid service, which was fine, and then found we did. Maid had been in every day and put dishwasher on/replaced towels etc. Bonus! It was a short walk to the main centre but nothing awful and you could cut through past the small pool etc. We ate at the bar/grill one night which was nice. Didn't really use any other services apart from the smaller pool - lovely - and the shop - expensive but useful to have. And pizza takeaway service - good.

Our room came with a fridge, toaster, bowls, sink, bed, balcony and sofa. We got a good rate throuugh Expedia, and due to the recommendation from this site (always use it) we went for it. We were not disappointed. It was clean, quiet and all our needs (not that we're fussy) were catered for. We stayed for 8 nights, on a bit of a theme park mission. It's excellently located for getting to Seaworld - leave the car at the hotel. They have regular people patrolling from what I saw, and it's gated. Not that it really needs to be, the area is great. If you're expecting to be able to walk to a load of restaurants and bars, this probably isn't the place for you, though - not that it bothered us, there are much cheaper places for English people to go for a drink/sun holiday! It's also about a 2 minute drive from Discovery Cove, depending on the one or two lights you'll encounter. Parking there is free, so don't even think about walking it - especially if it's hot! Save your energy! As for general amenities, the hotel has a gym that I used a few times with a few running machines, 2 weights benches (dumbells), an exercise bike and a few other general machines. Good enough to keep you in check on vacation.This is open until 11pm - perhaps it would have been nice to be open a little later, as you'd probably still be out in Orlando at that time, especially if the theme parks close late as they do in high season. The hotel also has two decent pools and lots of loungers, a shop that's open until 11, featuring a pizza hut takeout desk (they also deliver, quite handy on your first night), a restaurant by the pool (we ate there once, food was decent), a couple of shuffleboard courts, an outdoor table tennis table and a pool table, free to use. They also have some sort of track surrounding the hotel lake for running, but as I had just broken my foot a month beforehand I didn't get to use this. You park for free at the hotel, no matter what room you buy. Some websites don't list it as free for all rooms, but it is. We stayed in the Turner building and had no trouble whatsoever finding a space, even when we returned late. One word of warning - the Expedia concierge desk added a charge on to our Disney tickets. We couldn't buy them direct from Disney online (redirected to a site wanting you to buy \u00c2\u00a3220 ticket valid for 14 days - no thanks!) so we were going to wait and buy them at the park. Conscious that the lines may be long, we decided to get them early. We ended up paying about $20 over the odds for two tickets. Would have been better had the guy just told us we would be better off buying them at the park, but you live and learn. They did seem to help other people, for example they got the couple in front of us into a pretty booked up show with cheaper tickets. I guess it just depends what you want to use the desk for. Sometimes, there's also a bit of a wait...seemed like each of the two people at this desk could only book certain tickets for certain things. In all, it's decent that they have this facility, and that you can pick tickets up before getting to the parks, but it'd have been nice if they were honest and just told us to wait. As far as getting to the other parks goes, it's easy. We used a combination of Sat Nav on my Nokia phone and the directions sheet they give out at the front desk to find them. It couldn't be much easier to get to the parks if you're driving, the freeway entrance is about 2 mins from the hotel and hard to go wrong. For Disney, you just head up the ramp for Tampa, and follow the signs. It's easy as pie. For Universal, it's a different route but no more challenging. Florida is usually the first place many English people go in America, but it's one of the last touristy places we've hit, mainly due to the cost of motoring if you're under 25. You really DO need a car here, I wouldn't consider using public transport. With all the hassle of theme parks, the last thing you want to do is add to it by waiting around for buses, especially with the humidity. They did have an activity center, but we were never around to use it. All in all, this place is a fantastic base for exploring Orlando, and if you want to just spend a day chilling by the pool, this place will cater for you. Probably wouldn't recommend it if that's all you wanted to do (there are better places to go if you just want to chill - Marco Island for one), but for hitting the parks, I give this place two thumbs up.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAgain next time\u201d", "Author": "mountainnew", "ReviewID": "UR76353911", "Content": "We had an appartment with two bedrooms and a jacuzzi, two balcons and lot of space in the rooms, this was fine.

Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted at the gate, given a parking pass and directed to the lobby. The woman at the front desk was friendly but almost to a condescending degree as she told us she thought we'd enjoy our updated room next to the pool. Entering the room it had a very strong chlorine smell and the linens felt damp. As we prepared to go to dinner loud squeals and children's voices were heard right outside our window next to our bed. To the left of our window was a jacuzzi was filled with young children and one adult. I fully understand the family friendly atmosphere, however, the jacuzzi should be regulated to certain ages especially if situated right outside guest windows and at 8pm at night. After dinner I stopped by the lobby to inquire about changing rooms. The same woman who checked us in told us we would have to check back in the morning before 10am to see if there were any rooms to transfer to as they \"had to keep open rooms ready incase other potential guests came in throughout the evening.\" It was 11:30pm! Apparently to the Hilton the potential of other guests coming in the middle of the night was more valued than an existing customer with 5 nights already purchased. I even went online that night and could've booked the same room for the same rate that night, it wasn't about the availability of changing rooms, it was about having one less room to give to a new customer without a reservation. Our comfort was sacrificed for the Hilton's unlikely potential profit, thanks. The next morning we received 2 phone calls to our room before 10am, neither of which had anything to with changing rooms but 1) to inform us about activities that would be happening that day and 2) to invite us to the sales presentation as mentioned in other reviews. Silly me for thinking either of those calls would have anything to do with my complaint the evening before. I voiced my situation when asked how our stay was going and may have well got the answer, \"That's not my job, that's just my intro line, try dialing 0.\" As far as I'm concerned the hotel should not make promotional calls to your room, let alone twice a day each day. Luckily we spent very very little time in the room for the rest of our stay and avoided the noise (a woman gets on a megaphone for a few hours in the early afternoon in the pool area, note: this will cause a headache), and avoided the rude employees racing around on golf carts throughout the parking lots. Overall if you're looking for a reasonable rate near Sea World, Aquatica, and Discovery Cove the hotel will suffice if you get a cheap rate, but avoid rooms in the Hamilton building next to the pool if you want to have any silence during pool hours (7am-11pm). Also, maybe mention during check in that you do not wish to receive promotional calls as we had 2 messages each night we got back to our room. Otherwise the hotel is very clean (when housekeeping doesn't forget you, we did not receive housekeeping our 2nd day) and feels safe.

We arrived around 4pm and I waited a few minutes for an available front desk agent. I was not greeted as a Diamond member (which doesn't really matter, just knowing typically this is a Hilton process) and the clerk quickly started to check me in. I mentioned that I had called last week and again that morning to inquire about an upgrade from the room that we booked. I was told that the property did not provide free upgrades as he was running my keys. I quickly mentioned that was not a problem, if an upgrade was available for pay let's discuss it. Reluctantly the clerk tossed the keys aside and went back to the terminal to see what was available. Needless to say, in this huge complex, there was nothing available. Strange, I was told on the phone earlier that they were no at capacity and it shouldn't be a problem once I arrived. We arrived at our Queen Studio and the room was nice although a little bit tight and the bathroom was tiny as well. It did have a little fridge, microwave and a safe to lock valuables in. The rooms have pack-n-plays so for parents with little ones this is nice, although you will have a tough time finding a place to put it. When it came time to pull out the couch for my son to sleep we had to put the coffee table on the balcony.

Wash cloths never came but we did get a recorded voicemail at 7:59pm saying our room was not serviced due to OUR request for privacy. I'm sorry, you don't come at dinner time to make up a room and then not follow through on the only request. The next morning was our check out and we had considered hanging out by the pool. I called to request an extended check out (it's 10:00AM currently) and was flatly denied. At 9AM a maid (gasp) knocks on our door to ask us if we are checking out today. Funny, that speedy service wasn't available during our stay just helping us have that feeling of kicking us out the door as soon as possible. Check out was fairly quick although I had to go to the front desk instead of the typical bill brought tot he door. Was never asked how my stay was once and I really didn't feel like offering. One of the best things that happened to me was while I was checking in was mentioning that I was coming back in one week for two more nights in Orlando. A front desk staffer actually recommended the Hilton Convention Center hotel which is newer and in my opinion so much nicer. On our return trip we stayed at that location and were much more pleased...even saw the fireworks at Seaworld from our room. Last thing - before we even departed to Orlando, I'm in a business meeting in DC. I get a call on my cell phone from a telemarketer from Hilton wanting to know if in my short trip would I be willing to attend a 1 hour presentation. I explained that I had my kids and was continuously prodded that they had people to watch them. I explained that I would need to speak with my wife about this and the lady wanted me to give her my wife's cell phone so she could call her. I'm sorry, not only is this unprofessional, it's just wrong. I'm not spending 1 hour of a very short stay listening to a sales presentation.

A washer and a dryer with soap, We had 3 flat screen televisions. Our room got a jacuzzi . We were really impressed. The hotel staffs are very helpful and very courteous. You could also buy some deli and other supplies from their mini market near the reception area. Booking your Theme park tickets won't be a problem which they can get it at the concierge area. In short all about the resort was great except for one thing...... We received a call from Hilton asking you about your stay and if there any assistance you would be needing. Initially we thought it was so kind of them to check on their guest. Then it was followed that they would like to invite you to join a mini presentation of their another new Hilton resort in Orlando. The lady says that it will only be less than 2 hours presentation and after the presentation they will give you some incentives. Somebody will pick us up from where we are staying then will drive us to their new resort and breakfast will be serve. Since we would like to see the new resort , we did agree to attend the presentation. Next day we were picked up by a van and when we reach the new Hilton (which some part is still on construction); we were escorted to a room where there are also a lot of guest from various Hilton resort in Orlando. Each family is assisted by a representative. Then the presentation was started. You will be asked about your lifestyle, dream vacation, also about your stay. At first the representative was very accommodating and friendly and courteous. Then after he talked for an hour then he try to convince you to get a time share at Hilton and make it appear that it would be on the guest advantage in the future. He presented to us, that it will be base on points so in the future whenever you plan to go for a vacation you can book at any Hilton in the world anytime. An amount was presented ranging from $7,000 to $14,000. We try to inform him that we do go on vacation very often and we already got other timeshare with RCI. We inform him that getting another timeshare is not our priority as of this time. In short we are not interested. But he kept on going that we are not planning our money well and that we will regret paying hotels rather than getting a timeshare with Hilton. Very persistent, a person that doesn't want to take \"NO\" for an answers. Sensing that we are really not interested, he told us that he could lower the price, and initial cash out would be $3,000+ and the balance will be thru financing. But he fail to convince us. Logically, we are on a vacation, why will we shell out $3,000 at that instance. He was really upset that we don't want it. His attitude suddenly changed. He left then another person approached us, this time telling us that the incentive was they are offering us resort stay for free in Hawaii, etc. but we have to give $1,000+ . with a condition it must be used in 15 months time. Then if you still don't want to get a timeshare they will refund your money after the 15 months period. But still we don't want it. After that more than 2 hours session, we were shown our way out, this time no one will assist you where the elevator was nor assist you who will bring you back to your respective hotel. When we went down the lobby area, we met the other guests that attended the same presentation. Some of them really got so angry. Not surprising, cause you are having a great vacation then all of the sudden you will feel so annoyed and intimidated by a timeshare representative.

I also requested a renovated building and no connecting door if possible. Upon arriving at my assigned unit in the Warwick building, I realized I was 0 for 3 on my requests. The bed definitely was not a King, looked like a Full to me, but may have been a Queen. Decor was very dated and there was a large rip in the couch cushion fabric and connecting door to the next unit was directly across from the bed. As a light sleeper, basically my worst nightmare. When I called to voice my concerns the front desk initially tried to blow me off and said studio rooms could have either King or Quenn beds and most have connecting doors. After some arguing on my part, including telling them I had specifically reserved a King which was listed as a separate option from Queen, they agreed to move me. The new unit in Hamilton House was a major improvement. Obviously recently renovated with modern decor and at least the connecting door was right near the front door which is a lot better than right by the bed. Could definitely hear next door neighbors right through the connecting door and could also hear when they were being loud in their kitchen area so I'd rate the sound proofing at about a C, but luckily they were not early risers. Bathrrom was very small and awkward and single elevator serving the entire building was painfully slow and often crowded. Overall I was definitley not impressed. I have also stayed in the two other HGV properties in Orlando, although I stayed in one bedroom units there so can't give an apples to apples comparison.

We stayed both times in the complex closest to Seaworld, where we could sit on the patio and watch the fireworks at Seaworld.

The pool area has two pools, along with a kiddy pool and a playground that is covered so it doesn't get too hot. Around the complex is a walk way that has stations that can be used as exercise equipment and it's a nice walk to take. The path actually follows the lake that is inside the complex, and we did see a gator in the lake - YIKES... but this is Florida and where there is water, there is potential alligators.

We bought a box of 50 nappies which went missing from our room, and our door was left open on one occasion. - water poured through our ceiling on one night from the jacuzzi bath above us.

Previously I have stayed in the 2 bedroom units which are roomy and nicely decorated. This review is for a 1 room studio queen. The room was comfortable. Basic amenities are provided: coffee maker, mini refrigerator, microwave, sink and suficient plates, glasses etc... for 2 persons. There is a queen bed, and a pull out sofa an armoire w tv and a table and 2 chairs that furnish the studios, it is a tight squeeze as rooms go. Additionally there is a screened patio with a table and chairs on it. I traveled for business this trip: the resort room was inexpensive (under $100) in comparison with many resorts and hotels around the convention center, as it was the week between the Daytona 500 and \"Bikers Week\" and most hotels jack up prices (Hiltons did not). Overall the staff was friendly and helpful. Common areas are well maitained and clean. However, housekeeping left much to be desired. I assumed since I booked it as a \"hotel\" and not a \"time share condo\" I would recieve daily maid service, and supposedly I was to get it... however, on 2 of the 5 days, the maid conveniently didn't show until 5PM as we were getting back from our conference and needing to change to have dinner meetings. When the maid finally did show up I told her we only needed her to place fresh towels and TP in the bathroom and coffee for the kitchenette, we got the towels and coffee, but discovered at 10PM no TP, so I had to call down to front desk for it to be brought up (they brought up enough for a family of 10). The floors of the studio looked as thought they had not been mopped in months. However, overall the place appeared generally clean. Our TV did not work properly so it was replaced w/ another that had \"ghosts\" or double picture due to age, but we were here on business so we did not make a big deal out of it. On my \"free\" day I decided to lie around the pool, which is great for a resort, one pool has a waterfall in it and both are heated. Plenty of activities for children (face painting, T-shirt painting), a great place for families to take a day off from the \"parks\". To my very pleasant surprise there was Live music to enjoy around the pool area throughout the day. For exercise enthusiasts like myself, there is a 1/4 mile running/jogging trail around the little lake and a decent exercise room w/ a few treadmills bikes, free weights and some pilates and yoga equipment (which I used as often as I could). Overall I would recommend this resort for business travelers and families (if you can deal with the minor inconveniences of the housekeeping issues).

We never stayed at this HGVC resort yet, but love the HGVC on International Drive. Despite concerns that the resort amenities were 'outdated', but on short notice, this was the only resort that could accomodate us. However, after my stay, I think I like this resort more than the other one! We were put in the Villa group closest to the clubhouse/check in building, in a studio suite. It may have been renovated already...the color scheme was contemporary with neutrals. The view outside the window was of the lovely walking path that winds around th facility. The TV was a LCD flat screen. Free high speed internet was good. Bed was king sized, and comfortable. The bathroom was a bit on the small side, but that may have been due to the location/layout of the room...it was sort of wedged into a corner. The studio was able to be connected to the adjoining suite to form a 2 or 3 bedroom unit. Because of this, we felt like we could hear more noise from the unit over, (a family with a small child)which was pretty unfortunate when we wanted to sleep in late after checking into the resort at 3AM. Around the common areas, we loved the convenience store. The prices didn't seem to be too expensive either. There was a mini Pizza Hut and a deli for prepared meals. What we really loved was the bar and the tarped area over looking the pool. We had a night cap one night and it was lovely. This area also served as the resort's restaurant, and the menu (lunch/dinner) seemed very well rounded. We had the buffet breakfast on Sunday, which was convenient but a bit on the expensive side (at least the food was good and and freshly prepared/restocked). Because of our short stay and even shorter time spent at the resort (mainly for sleeping), I didn't get to see more of what was on offer. I would definitely like to go back again!

Sadly, I can't say that our recent stay fell in that category. We are owners in HGVC time share and are use to the HGVC level of service. That being said, our stay was good until Friday evening when our one bedroom unit was overwhelmed with cigarette smoke. Upon investigation, it was coming in through the A/C unit. We turned off the A/C and closed the vents (good thing it was Nov.). We called the front desk and told them about our issue. They listened but didn't seem overly concerned. We then looked out on our screened porch to see that the only occupied unit was the one above us (our unit was a ground floor, corner unit). We called the desk again, since the smell had not dissapated, and this time the staff said that they would send security to check it out but sounded a little put out. We didn't hear anything about any resolution to the issue. This happened again on Saturday night, prior to our departure on Sunday. I called ,checking on check-out time, and again mentioned that the cigarette smell was back. The staff member said that security didn't find anything the night before. They were more understanding but the issue was not resolved. I have no issues with people who want or need to smoke. They have just as much right to smoke as I do to have a smoke less room when on vacation. But I do have an issue with people who do not follow rules just because it doesn't suit them.

Let's start with the good things first: we were able to get an early check-in (11am); the one bedroom suite with whirlpool tub was great - very clean (which is one of the most important details I look for in hotel reviews); all of the rooms were very spacious and furnished nicely; the kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with supplies (dish detergent, paper towels, laundry detergent, Crabtree and Evelyn soaps, lotions and shampoos); the screened in porch was great, especially since it was unusually hot and humid for the end of October and the bugs were still out in full force; the pool that was next to our building was beautiful and not crowded (I guess that most guests head to the main two pools near the clubhouse) and finally, the location of the hotel is great (across the road from Sea World, a couple of minutes from International Drive - where there are many restaurants to pick from and an easy drive to all of the Disney parks). Now, for the not so good comments: I specifically asked for a room that was in a quiet building (we were put in building #9, which is at the far end of the complex and we were told, is the most quiet) and our room was a corner unit on the third floor (there are six floors). I don't know if it's our bad luck or not - but, whenever we travel, we always manage to be placed next to noisy, rowdy travelers - hence, the specific request for a quiet location. But, bad luck followed us once more because our first night, we were awakened at 3am by a young, Jamaican couple having a nasty, very loud argument (I lost count of the number of F-bombs that were dropped). Remember, we're on a corner unit with only one other guest room next to us and it figures, we get the obnoxious neighbors. I attributed the argument to a long night of partying - so, I closed the bedroom and bathroom doors, turned on the AC and the noise was somewhat blocked out. On our second day - they were at it again (at 7am) - only much louder and more obscene. We called the front desk to ask for security to handle the problem - which they did eventually send someone - just as the neighbors were getting ready to check out. My advice, if you want a quiet location, request a corner room on the sixth floor of building 9 or 10 and if you do get rowdy neighbors, call security right away. We waited too long. A few other negative comments: the housekeepers never showed up at our room the second day of our stay. We had been at one of the parks all day and on returning to the hotel at 5:30pm, our bed was still not made and our wet towels, from the morning, were still hanging in the bathroom. We called the front desk and were told that the housekeeping staff was at the hotel until 6pm and that someone would take care of our room. About ten minutes later there was a knock on the door and a young man simply handed me fresh towels and walked away. Advice - verify on check-in what your housekeeping arrangements are - whether it's a full cleaning or just fresh towels, trash emptied and bed made each day. If they don't follow through - call. Regardless of the two mentioned negative comments - we still had a great time - I'm just not sure if I would come back to the Hilton.

We walked to Sea World, but drove to Aquatica (still walkable, but a little far for kids). Tip: We bought combination Sea World and Aquatica tickets that allow you to come and go at both parks for 14 days from time of first use (we only used 4 days). These were a pretty good deal. Sunday check in was busy, but efficient. We were in and out in about 15 minutes. Check out was via phone, so was even faster. The units were very well laid out. We stayed in a 2 bedroom in the Sandy's building. It was clean upon arrival and tidied up mid week. One of my kids used a sofabed and it was surprisingly comfortable. The resort supplied so much soap, dishwasher detergent, dish soap, shampoo, and conditioner in the unit that we barely needed to touch our own. They also had a generous starter supply of coffee. The Jacuzzi in the master bedroom was huge. Our only need for maintenance was to have a kettle with peeling paint inside replaced, which they had done by the time we returned that day. One of our kids threw up in bed one night and we stripped the bed and offered to clean the sheets, but they said no problem and sent someone who remade the bed for us. I think the buildings are all concrete because my cell phone wouldn't work in the unit at all and only got a weak signal on the balcony. The benefit of this, however, was no discernable noise from other units. There wasn't much of a view from our second floor balcony (there were two balconies in our unit, one off each bedroom), but the plus side of a lower floor was that we didn't have to wait for the slow elevator and could take the stairs. I'd prefer a lower floor for that reason. Free wired and wireless internet access was available in the unit and it seemed pretty fast to me. The grounds were well maintained and there was a jogging path around the lake that I used a couple of mornings. The fitness center had very nice equipment (treadmills with built-in TVs), although the one weight machine created a bottleneck that left people waiting. They could use another. I used dumbbells, which are also available, rather than wait for the weight machine. They could probably use another treadmill as well (all three were in use at two points during my 7 AM visit). The resort seemed to have a good activities schedule, but we were so busy off the resort that we weren't around to take advantage of the activities. They had movies in their theatre, ice cream by the pool, etc. We were RCI exchangers, but we were not solicited for a timeshare presentation at all, not even by phone message. The only reference to vacation ownership we saw was a booklet on our coffee table. The resort has three very nice pools, with the waterfall pool being our kids' favourite. While nice, the pools were also the source of our only significant concern about the resort. The water at all three was milky. We wore swimming masks and still couldn't make out a person clearly from 6 feet away underwater. Granted, the pools had a continuously high bather load in the hot July Orlando weather, but other hotel and theme park pools we swam in this month (including nearby Aquatica) managed to have clear water. This issue prevents me from rating the resort higher, as pools are very important to families and kids. I am sure they could easily fix this. The staff we met were all very friendly.

Next to the room there was a small baby who did nothing but cry. We called the front desk and after going to the front desk again, they sent us to another room. Our room key would not open. We waited outside for over 20 min to have security come and open the door for us. When security showed, his key would not open.

There are many good reviews so I will attempt to provide highlights of the resort and new developments or changes we observed. We traveled with our two children ages 5 and 9. Overall we had an excellent stay at the resort and were impressed with the service and quality. The resort is fantastic for families. There is a full complement of activities for kids and adults and the activity staff at the resort does an excellent job. The activities are centered in and around the main pool but do include evening events and field trips for the kids. Some activities are free and others have a fee. The resort does a good job of posting the full activity list for the month on the www.hgvc.com website. You should see a link on the resort page to a pdf of the activity listing. Our kids participated in many of the activites from water baseball to the pirate pool party. My oldest son and I competed in a contest called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Amazing Race\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite fun. There are dive in movies two times a week. We have done this before and it is great but this trip rain caused the movies to be moved to the theater near the lobby. There have been recent extensive upgrades and refurbishments at the resort and there is more to come. The Provisions deli, store and Pizza Hut outlet has been completely redone. It is very nice and a definite upgrade from the previous store. Prices for groceries are on the high range but the deli and pizza prices are reasonable for a resort outlet. There is a covered patio area just outside the store. The coral reef bar and grill by the main pool has also been renovated, expanded and improved. It is much nicer than the previous version, food is good, cost reasonable, and service was very good for us. There is a happy hour every day from 4 pm to 7 pm with drink specials. The main pool deck has also recently been completely replaced and in my opinion the new surface is much better than the original one. All of the deck chairs have also been replaced and the new ones are steps above the old style chairs that were previously on the deck. The fitness center also was completely redone with new Hilton Precor equipment ... very nice. We learned that the lobby and owners lounge will be completely remodeled before the end of the year and this will include an expanded business center and improvements to the theater. The grounds of the resort continue to be very well maintained. Among other things the resort includes: shuffle board, a covered playground near the main pool, a kiddie pool, a spray feature, a basketball court and tennis court. All of these amenities are in good condition. Others have noted that the resort has 3 pools. Two adjacent to the main club house and a smaller pool in another location at the resort. The main pool (water fountain feature) was heated and warm. The waterfall pool next to it was not heated and much cooler. We swam in and enjoyed both. There are numerous hot tubs at the resort. We stayed in a two bedroom unit in the Tucker Townhouse building. This is the newest building at the resort and is nearest Seaworld (We had a direct view of Seaworld and the fireworks). The building is also near the main pool and all of the activities. Our room was in great shape with granite counters, newer appliances and comfortable beds. The room did not have LCD TVs but the living room TV was a newer nice flat tube TV with a Bose DVD/audio unit. We experienced just one issue. On our last day the elevator in our building went out of service. We checked out before it was repaired but the resort was prompt in addressing the issue.

The main pool has a great layout, and we were able, each time, to get a little landscaped block facing the big lake. It was VERY relaxing and very nice. We just turned around for a quick jump in the pool whenver we wanted. The towel situation was a wreck - they were terrible about re-filling the towel station. Every time we went, we had to wait at least 15 minutes for towels to show up (and then they would go quickly). The room was nice. We had a one bedroom. It had a screened in porch. A nice jacuzzi tub.

The hotel staff are very friendly, the pools are fantastic & clean and there are a lot of activities to do during the day. This is a perfect family resort, but they also have private areas for couples. The only negative thing we experienced during our trip was that we were told they had a shuttle service to the Disney parks that went at all times. This is not the case. They do have a fantastic shuttle service (Sterling Shuttle), however, they only go 3 times per day to Epcot Center and then you need to take the Disney buses to the other parks and Disney District. In addition, they only have 3 returns back to the hotel and the last one leaves Epcot at 10:00 PM. If you want to stay at the Magic Kingdom until midnight or later, you'll have to take a cab back which will run you about $30 for one way. Sterling Shuttle will also schedule a private pick up for you and it will be about $28. The daily shuttle to Epcot is only $6 for a round trip fare so it's a pretty good deal if you do not mind the time restrictions. For the most part , we were able to get around fine without a car during our week long stay. However, it is a good idea to rent a car if you do not want to be restricted by shuttle times. Plus there is so much to do in Orlando that having a car enables you to get around more and see what's there. HGV does not run the Concierge desk, it is run by Expedia. The Expedia folks are VERY busy and almost never answer the telephone. The best thing to do is wait in line and purchase all of your shuttle tickets in advance so you do not have to deal with them on a daily basis. You can get discounted park tickets way cheaper online so do not buy them at the hotel. There is a grocery store onsite that carries basic necessities but you may want to stop at a store before you check in. HGV also will stock your refrigerator with some basic necessities such as; eggs, milk, pop, butter, coffee, pancake mix and syrup, chips and salsa etc. You can order this weekender package online at their website and it will be ready for you when you check in. There is also a pizza hut onsite and one restaurant and bar. The restaurant and bar close early around 11:00 PM. HGV will also do some special events such as making freeze dried ice cream which is REALLY good! and special non-alcoholic drinks. I can't say enough good things about this place.

We had booked a 2 bedroom condo with sleep sofa and was a bit surprised at the layout when we got to our room. It was really two separate hotel rooms, but you could connect them by a common doorway. The bedrooms were really far apart so we were not comfortable with our 7 year old daughter sleeping in the 2nd bedroom so we gave that to our 17 year old son who thought it was 'cool'. The first night my husband slept on the pullout couch (uncomfortable) and my daughter and I in the other bedroom. It wasn't working out well so we called the front desk and they promptly brought up a spare twin bed that we set up in our room so our daughter could sleep with us in the same room. The rooms are very big and the master has a huge jacuzzi tub that nobody used (other than the kids to store stuff). The master bath has a double sink which was nice for my husband and I getting ready in the morning. We also had a large shower. Our sons room had a smaller bathroom with Tub/Shower. We spent the day at the pool and enjoyed all the ammenities the hotel has to offer, especially for kids. They schedule activities throught the day that keep everyone busy and happy. The have several pools (heated, unheated, shallow, hot tubs) so none of them seemed crowded which was nice. That night I went to cook dinner and noticed what i thought was a cockroach in the electronic panel of the stove. My husband took a look and we agreed. We called the front desk and they sent someone up right away. When he opened the panel SEVERAL cockroaches came scurrying out. He let the front desk know and within an hour they had us moved to a new room no questions asked. We were told they were not going to rent out that room until it was fumagated. The new room was the same set up and very clean. No more issues with cockroaches. That night we went out to play mini golf and when we got back the staff had sent up a big gift basket of goodies and an apology card signed by all the staff members.

We walked to Seaworld 2 days in a row, most people were parking almost as far out in the parking lot as a 5 min walk from the hotel. If I had to change one thing; I would request to not have a ground-floor condo. The sprinklers came on every night, and people were walking by all the time. Next time we'll go for a more private choice. If we go to Orlando again, we'll definitely stay here. The price beat every other hotel in the area, and we really felt like we were at a resort. The other guests were all over 35 with small children, or seniors. We felt safe and comfortable. The staff was amazing, except for one grumpy bartender, but perhaps she won't be there for long. Pizza Hut with room delivery cost about the same as at home, but we got 5 times the breadsticks and cinnamon sticks for the price. We had cinnamon bread for breakfast every morning (yum) PS the store is deathly expensive.

This hotel is not close to restaurants or shopping but you can walk to Seaworld as it is across the road. I would recommend that if you stay here, you have to rent a vehicle to do your shopping. If not, you are limited to use the I-Ride which is $1.25 each time you hop on or you can buy a pass for one week which is $10.00 per person. This trolley goes up and down International Drive. The taxis are very expensive. They wanted $28.00 US round trip to bring us to Walmart which apparently is right down the road. You will not be disappointed if you rent a car. It's worth it and avoids the waiting for the trolley which only goes by the hotel every 30 minutes. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told to pick up a gift at the desk. Do not get caught. This gift is a free brunch but you have to attend one of their time sharing sales pitch to sell you a condo. Luckily, for us, we had read other comments on the internet before going so we did not get lured into this and waste a morning of our vacation.

Just got back from staying there a few days ago and I love it even more now! I don't know where to start, there is so much to write about. The property and rooms are gorgeous (and very clean)! Its nicely set up so that you feel like you're in your own paradise, but still close to shopping and restaurants. One of the main reasons we stayed here is because we wanted to be close to Sea World and it is within walking distance, perfect location! You can see the park from the hotel. From our room (which was on the side farthest from Sea World) it was about a 15 minute walk to the main gate, seemed way shorter though. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really nice walk to the park and if you don't want to walk there is an I Trolley stop right in front of the hotel and you can take that. Having an I Trolley stop right in front of the hotel is also another reason we chose to stay here. The rooms are so pretty and spacious! We stayed in a 1 bedroom Villa. Having a separate living area and bedroom is always an added plus, and a full kitchen, with utensils, dish washer, microwave, stove, blender, mixer and so on is fantastic! The in room whirl pool was more than amazing to come back to after those long days of walking. Another really nice thing about the rooms are the balconies. Every morning I would go out on the balcony to relax and enjoy the view. There is a separate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vanity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area, right near the whirl pool, which was really nice to have that space so the bathroom sink area was not all cluttered with stuff. Having a washer and dryer in the room is really great too, and they do supply the detergent which is very nice. The grounds are beautifully landscaped. There is a basket ball court, tennis court, shuffle board court as well as several pools and hot tubs. There is a mini movie theater, which is really cool and they play movies nightly. The on site store/deli has everything you could need! Microwaveable food, beverages, toiletries, cereals, post cards, souvenirs, as well as some ready to eat items, a little ice cream sundae area and Pizza Hut Express is located here too. The pools and hot tubs are so nice! The main pool area is gorgeous. They have daily activities in this area. Some of the activities were hair braiding/wraps, ice cream sundaes, ice cream floats and live entertainment to name a few. The one night they had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dive Inn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd movie. The pool side entertainment was great! They had live music with steel drums and singing, definitely added to the whole tropical paradise setting. Aside from the pool area activities the hotel also offers various other activities and outings (some for additional fees.) You'll get a schedule of activities at check in, as well as the movie theater schedule too. There is also a restaurant located at the main pool area, serving beverages, appetizers, sandwiches and so on. We had seen someone with the nachos earlier during our trip and they looked too good to pass up. Had the grilled chicken nachos and they were very tasty. The staff REALLY impressed me! I have stayed at places where everyone is nice, but here I really felt welcomed and everyone was more than willing to help you. Every employee we passed always smiled and said hello. From the moment we arrived until we left everyone we encountered was so friendly. One of the girls at the front desk was really helpful. She checked us in and then at the end of our trip we went to the computer area to print our boarding passes and one of the computers was in use and the other one was having technical issues so we went to the desk to see if we could print them anywhere else and she said they could do them right there at the counter and she had our boarding passes booked and printed in a matter of minutes, that was REALLY helpful to us. Definitely something to remember if you have to check into a flight/print your boarding passes. Another great highlight is that all of the rooms have free internet connection. I had concerns that we might be pressured into attending a timeshare presentation, but this was no problem at all! They asked us at check in if we would like to attend a presentation about a new resort they are building, and we were not sure if we would be bale to so we said we would call them if we decided to attend and they didn't \"bother\" us anymore. I REALLY hope to stay at this property again! It added so much to the whole trip experience and I can't wait to go back!

The rooms offer ample space, nice bathrooms, a great layout, are nicely decorated, and are very family and kid-friendly (especially when traveling with an almost one-year-old who is like a monkey and gets into EVERYTHING). The kitchen and the screened-in balcony provided great opportunities for eating in and even in preparing meals to bring to the amusement parks (which I highly recommend - they charge an arm and a leg to eat there because you're a captive audience. There's plenty of shopping around to stock your refrigerator). Yes, the view from the balcony could have been nicer but we weren't staying in Orlando for the view! The washer/dryer were so convenient and really a necessity - especially when travelling with kids. We were there at Easter and the resort even arranged for a mere $30 charge to have the Easter bunny come to our unit and hand deliver an Easter basket to our children! You cannot top that! The complex is well manicured and sprawling so be prepared to walk or drive to the pool or the main center depending upon where your unit is located - no big deal, really: exercise is good for you anyway. The pool area is simply gorgeous with three large pools - one of them a 1' kiddie pool. There is a great, casual restaurant at the pool area where we frequently ordered take-out - fresh, healthy, grilled choices are plentiful. The location is great - right near major interstates and literally across the street from Sea World! Don't stay here without a rental car - I don't know what one reviewer was doing here without one! Also - get a good map or navigation system because Orlando road signs leave a great deal to be desired. We plan on returning in the next year and wouldn't stay anywhere else.

We called maintenance before we left for the evening. They arrived while we were gone and left a note that the tub & wi-fi were repaired. It was late when we returned. We didn't check the tub jets, but the bathroom lights didn't work. We had to call maintenance about the lights the next morning. They repaired them while we were out during the day. There were televisions and dvd players in each of the bedrooms and the living room. The dishwasher was VERY noisy, and the clothes dryer took a long time to get clothes dry. I had to send them through 2 - 3 drying cycles. The pool area was nice, but most of the rooms were a long walk from the pool. There were also two tennis courts and two adjustable-height basketball goals. There was a ping-pong table in the pool area. The location of the hotel is only good if you plan to spend your time at Sea World. My daughter and I had breakfast reservations at Disney's Polynesian hotel one morning. I called the front desk to ask about the shuttle. I was told it was $15 per person one way, and didn't run until 9am so she offered to call a taxi. I asked about what it would cost, and was told it would only cost around $15 total. She said she would arrange the taxi for me. She called back to tell me the taxi would be there at 7am. At 7:15 a shuttle van came to pick us up. We were charged $35 for a one-way trip. The driver told us it was $35 one way, or $50 round trip. When we left Walt Disney World we took a taxi for $22.

This resort is an example of how things should be done. We had a 40 member family reunion here this summer (2008), and we couldn't have asked for a better location or venue. From the moment you walk into the lobby, you are treated like royalty- the freshly brewed lemonade, the spacious lobby, the expansive pool, the courteous employees. From top to bottom, I was impressed with this place. Arrival- we had no issues with the check-in process. It's fairly easy to find and is close to all the Sea-World attractions as well as the Convention Center on International Drive. Our check-in clerk at the front desk was courteous and efficient, but could have used a little polishing. Especially as it relates to familiarizing us with the property. Nothing that a little walking around can't do, but it would have been nice to have a little more. No big deal. We were playing golf, so we spoke with the Concierge in the lobby... she didn't know much about golf, other than she could get us discounts on a couple of local courses. By the way, if you are going to play golf at the Marriot's Grande Pines, next door, plan on losing lots of balls, and scoring really high. I'm no scratch golfer, but we played here as well as the 'Palm' at Disney, and the Grande Pines was MUCH more difficult. Lots of water, sand and weeds. Probably too much for a recreational golfer looking for some escape from the mouse-ears during the week. But I digress- Getting moved in- we were here as Timeshare customers and weren't expecting much in the way of assistance in getting set up in our room, but we were pleasantly surprised to be assisted by a well-meaning, genuine gentleman who was working the laundry closet in our building. He helped us get an additional cart for moving stuff in. Pros: Great service at the pool-side bar, although the waiters/waitresses don't venture out very often or very far from the tables around the bar. The bartender Diane was especially helpful and kind, as well as Andre, I think his name was- they were always quick to acknowledge me even if they were busy. I was even given 2 complimentary fountain drinks by one of the floor waitresses when I came in with my niece in the heat of the day for some refreshments, while dripping wet. Incredible Pool- two large pools- the one with the waterfalls was about 5-10 degrees cooler than the other, and there are Jaccuzzi's seemingly everywhere you look. Also a small childrens pool area as well as mini-water playground type getup- shooting water from mats into the air, etc. I believe there is a 3rd pool, but we never ventured to it. The main pool area had everything we needed. Free Wireless Internet- This in and of itself should be standard at all resorts. Not having to deal with paying for the Internet is worth so much. Even better is that it's available in the pool area as well. Great 'other' entertainment options- Ping-Pong, Billiards, Shuffleboard, a sizeable playground with a canopy to protect the little ones from getting too much sun, daily activities for children (Belly-Dancing class or something, Deal or No-Deal game, Puppet Show, Bean-Bag Toss, are just a few things that I saw going on around the expansive pool area) They also show a movie nightly in a Theatre area off the main lobby. Spacious rooms- we stayed in a 3 bedroom villa, that had ample space for 5 adults and 3 little ones. 2 Lanais. Cons/Little stuff- Concierge didn't know the difference between 'walking and carting' for our golf game. The pool has a great sound-system that generally played non-invasive modern pop music. One afternoon it was replaced with a live duet of fat men singing 'oldies' way too loud, way too intrusive and way too much. It cleared the pool area around the stage pretty quickly. It's tough to find a live act that everyone can tolerate. But these guys were just a bit too much. Elevators are slow. We were on the 2nd floor so we just used the stairs, most times, but if we were on the 5th or 6th floor, they would have gotten cumbersome. The buildings have a strange horseshoe shape that required all guests to exit out of a single corridor. This is understandable for security purposes, but it was kind of annoying when you were just looking to go to the pool, but you had to go the opposite direction and then all the way around the building. I did get a few comments from the ladies in the group doing food prep that they were a little light on utensils and pots and pans, but being that our group had multiple rooms reserved, it was no problem for us to share. Overall, a great resort. Hilton has gotten it right with this one.

I used to live in Florida and spent much time in Orlando. I had recalled this resort, where I had stayed for a few nights about 5 years ago. The rate was a bargain ($81 AAA) for a queen junior suite. These rooms are configured as an open studio, with a dorm-sized fridge, microwave, sink, and basic kitchen utensils. The queen bed is nearby with either a loveseat or large chaise lounge. A table-for-two is located in a nook. Some of the junior suites include a screened-in balcony, but not all include this feature so ask when booking if it's important to you. The resort is rather expansive and enjoyed by families. Pools include waterfalls. A small store is on site, as are a few dining options. While I didn't travel with a child, it was clear that this resort would be appealing to folks with kids. The resort has an extensive offering of daily activities for kids. Staff were very friendly and gracious. I dined at the outdoor restaurant located near one of the pools. My group ordered burgers, turkey wraps, and ribs. Everything was tasty and not exorbitantly priced. My room was clean and adequately maintained. The carpet had several stains, the bathroom was due for an update, and some baseboards were in need of replacement. The bed, however, was comfy. Internet access was reputed to be complimentary, but I was never able to get it to work. My biggest complaint--which is a deal-breaker for me--was the lack of noise insulation between rooms. The noise was absolutely ridiculous. I had enjoyed my room for several hours, but around 10:30 pm my neighbors returned from their apparent day out. I was so startled when I heard whistling that I jumped up expecting someone to be standing in my foyer. I then looked out the security eyehole to see if the whistling person was standing at my door, but saw no one. It was then crystal clear that the person was on the other side of the \"wall\" separating our rooms. After the whistling stopped, I could then smell the families just microwaved popcorn as though I had microwaved it. And then the real fun began: \"Dad\" proceeded to share, in pronounced and crude detail, with his family how bad his jock itch was that day. This went on for about 5 minutes before \"Dad\" and \"son\" began a screaming match about bath time. I called the front desk and asked to be moved due to the noise. I was told no rooms were available. I persisted, knowing how large the resort was. I was still told nothing could be done. I got a little nasty at that point and the staff member consulted a manager. Miraculously, a room appeared for me. I had to pack, walk to the reception area, retrieve new keys, and then move to a building in a different part of the resort. When I arrived, my new room was wonderfully silent. (No internet access here either, though.) I was able to go to sleep immediately, but the noise issue returned at 6:30 am when my neighbors' infant began wailing at 6:30 am. I laid in bed, listening to the normally-toned conversations of a family. By 8:00 am, I had checked out. Until the resort invests some money in insulating the rooms for noise, you will stay at your own risk. I was miserable! I reflected upon my previous stay and realized that the room I was assigned then did not have a door that connected to an adjoining room. Both of the rooms I stayed in during this last visit shared that feature.

I called Universal Vacations and they straightened everything out pretty quickly. The hotel manager even upgraded our studio room to a one bedroom. It was very nice. The room had a full kitchen, living room, dining room, and a jucuzzi. My son loved the pool the best. They had three pools but one was closed. I didn't even notice that because the other pools were great. They also had several hot tubs and even a wading pool for the babies. We ordered from the onsite Pizza Hut and the service was pretty good. We also ate at the little Coral Reef bar and the food there was good also.

This is probably why we were given a room in the requested block, but by the highway. I telephoned Reception straight away and asked to be moved even if it meant another block, as it was late at night they asked if we could stay 1 night and move in the morning - we did this and ended up in a lovely room that met all my requests! In actual fact this highway seems less busy than International Drive itself. While sitting by the lovely pools you cannot see another hotel, (golf course next door) so it feels secluded. There is a fire station near by, but I'm sure all of central Orlando will hear this at some time during most days! It was only noticeable to us one morning at 7 am, which we didn't mind considering the tough job they were probably off too! I think this hotel is the most perfectly situated in Orlando. Walking distance to Sea World, but be careful crossing the road and drive the short distance if you plan to stay after dark. Easy access to International Drive, Interstate, Universal Studios and the huge Walmart on Turkey Lake Road and Disney. The Hotel offered a free shuttle to Sea World, Aquatica, Universal and a chargeable shuttle to Disney, but we preferred the flexibility of taking the car. Reception were always very friendly and helpful. Our son decided to change the safe number but couldn't remember what to...after a slight panic and 20 attempts we contacted Reception who sent security within 10 minutes. Problem soon solved and only a little embaressment on our behalf! We liked the huge rooms (1 bedroom ) with all the useful facilities, it was ideal. We stayed for 14 nights and found our apartment cleaned daily, with our sons new teddies displayed in a cute way! Toiletries, washing powder etc re-stocked with new each day too. Spa tub and private patio area were also an added benefit to us! There is a small restaurant, we found this adequate for the odd meal as we like to go to different places anyway. The staff here were the friendliest in the whole of Orlando! They will also do take-outs for you to eat in the privacy of your room. We stayed over Easter and our son really enjoyed the activities on Easter Day. The easter egg hunt of course being the favourite! We all enjoyed seeing the easter bunny too! There was a big programme of daily childrens activities and screened films, we caught one film by the pool, but generally we were too busy to do anymore than swim and chill in the hotel! Sorry to read that a few reviewers have had bad experiences, but I read reviews on many hotels for the best part of 6 months before choosing this one and I'm thrilled to say it was better than my expectations.

Due to timing issues after Christmas, me and my family needed a place to stay prior to our arrival so we chose Hilton Grand Vacations at Seaworld. The property is very well situated just off of Central Florida parkway on Grand Vacations Way. If you are one who loves serenity of beautiful grounds ad landscaping, you will not be disappointed. The check in was smooth and effortless. My advice to anyone checking in is, try and get there as early as possible. Obviously travel arrangements and kids for that matter will not always allow this but i've learned generally if you arrive while others are checking out, you can find units already available. I stayed in the 'Smiths,' which is building 10 and the furthest from the clubhouse and main pool. Me and my family enjoyed a Kingsuite, which was an upgrade as I am a Hilton honors member. Its absolutely free to join, and worthwhile to do so. The suite itself had a very large comfortable bed with duvet, and the softest pillows one could lay upon. Accompanied is a jacuzzi and a lock-off bathroom with his and her sinks, shower and there is a very large vanity mirror across from the jacuzzi. The living room was spacious, and included a sleeper sofa with another matching chair. Dining room table held 6 chairs with placemats readily available. Granite countertops highlight the kitchen as does the flat surface stove. (very nice touch) Standard size fridge with ice maker, dishwasher and not to be forgotten is the spacious screened alcony, which is accessible through the living room and Master bedroom. Due to our singular night, I did not get to research the various childrens activities, but they are rampant throughout the day and early evening. The waterfall pool is a sight to see in itself, with gallons of water in a constant downpour and plenty of space to interact and swim. There are 2 outdoor jacuzzis, one of which is situated right under the waterfall itself. There is also a kiddie pool which lil fishes decorating the bottom. In actuality there is another pool right next to the main jacuzzi and kiddie pool, which technically is the 'main' pool. It is very large with plenty of outdair chairs for those who enoy their sun, and each night they show various movies on an inflatable screen at the base of the pool. At check in, you should receive a copy for the movie schedule for the entire month, as well as the various childrens activities. In summation if you are a family with children particulrly toddlers and adolescents this is definitely a nice place to stay and relax. Im not sure how much teenagers would enjoy the experience, depending on what your Orlando itenerary is. The pools, countless activities, and customer service is very much noted and appreciated. It is a nice place for couples maybe looking for a getaway, not overly romantic but still a relaxed, chill environment. There arent any true restaurants, just a sandwich shop and pizza hut express, so please be advised you will need a car if you dont like simple or home cooked meals. There is a Publix grocery store off of international dr across from the Orlando premium outlets. If that doesnt suit you, you can take International Dr south to World Center Dr and make a right. Take World center and stay in the far left lane and make the first left on SR 535 (apopka vineland rd) and you will run into a Super Walmart about another mile on your right side. Of course for those who like the simpler way, there is a I-Ride trolley stop in front of one of the Hilton buildings.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ligonier, PA", "Title": "\u201cA Great Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "cish39", "ReviewID": "UR13019995", "Content": "I stayed at the Grand Vacation Club for 5 days while attending a conference.

Our check-in was, well, frustrating to say the least. We arrived one hour prior to our 4 o'clock check-in time and were told there was nothing available. They asked for our cell phone number and would call us when our villa was ready. Well, 40 minutes later and no call. Meanwhile, we decided to sit at the hotel bar and order beer and wings. The wings were stone cold in the middle and we sent them back. By 3:45 I decided to mosey on up to the check-in desk and ask. I think they absolutely forgot we were ever there. We were given a villa number in the next building to the main reception building. As we approached the villa two cleaning guys were just pulling out the steam cleaning machine from the villa. The door hadn't even closed behind them. My husband and I looked at each other and knew, this was not good. The carpet was soaked in every room. One could not even take off their shoes and walk around. And try walking from the soaked carpet to the ceramic tiles and you took your life in your hands. Never knew I could do splits like that! As well, there was a very large wet spot approx 1.5 foot in diameter on the sofa bed cushion that our son was to sleep on. Obviously, the people prior to us were slobs. I went down to check-in and expained the situation. We were not prepared to stay in that villa. We were given another key to a building on the complete other side of the property. Upon arriving there, bags in tow, again, the key did not work. Again, down to the main building and they sent security who let us in. After we got all our bags in (I do not pack light unfortunately) we were just about to settle in and there was a knock at the door. It was security informing us that we were in the wrong room. He said this room was occupied already even though there was nothing in the room, fridge was empty, no sign that anyone had been in that room. Again, we get all our baggage and were moved to the villa next door. This was now our third villa and we were not impressed. I never saw a single soul in the room next to us all week. We had the one bedroom lock-off unit. It was nonsmoking, as we requested. Apparently, the two lock-off units share the same ventilation system and the people in the adjoining studio ignored the no smoking signage on the villa doors. Needless to say, each morning we a shower and a smoke. Our villa smelled foul of second hand smoke. I called the front desk and was told they would send security. Nothing happened. They continued to smoke. As for the villas, we stayed in the Warwick building which was much newer than the first unit we were in. I think they tried to pawn off an old unit because we were not \"paying customers\" as such. It is not prudent for the HIlton to treat RCI members this way because they are part of RCI and their own owners benefit from being able to exchange to other properties as well. We were never offered an apology or any compensation for this very unprofessional check-in experience or \"customer service.\" I would choose another place to stay in future.

I would agree with one of other review: \"Disappointing aspect was terrible customer service. Without going into all the boring details, the staff repeatedly said all the things they'd been trained to say (empathizing with customer etc ...) but repeatedly failed to deliver the actions we'd agreed. \" The service was terrible, I had an impression, that they just do not care. If you are staying in the building not near the WaterFall pull, you have to take a little walk (depending on where your building is located) we stayed at Smith building and it took us 5 minutes walk to get to the main lobby. They do have a golf carts picking up people, but you have to call to the hotel front desk and even so they tell you the guy is on its way, usually you wait for them minimum 10 minutes, so might as well just walk to the main lobby. It is not a problem to get to the building from the main lobby there was always somebody available to pick us up. Perhaps they have only one guy riding and picking up people. The shuttle service to attractions is limited and I think that the drivers do not care so as the hotel employees, the drivers were late all the time at the first point of destination . Usually when you take the shuttle the bus driver is giving you a little tour of the city (from my experience staying at other Orlando hotels), nothing like that here, but the huge sign on the front window \"re tips\" is there :) I would not recommend use the taxi service from the hotel, I got impression that they use some transportation for hire, which is more expensive that local taxi service. For example, the driver gave us the rate to Arabian Nights show one way as $45 v local taxi service $17.00. The deli shop was terrible, and very small for such a big resort. Go to the grocery store and fill out your fridge because the food quality and selection at the deli shop is very poor. If you forgot a swimming suite you will not be able to buy it in the hotel, there is no gift shop, but the deli shop sells some t-shirts. There is no food room service, you can order pizza only, but at the extension numbers provided nobody answers the phone (I guess they are too busy) Not a big deal, we ordered pizza online, this is only the one good thing that they provide wireless connection at the hotel free, you just need to have your laptop with you. There is only one restaurant, the breakfast buffet at the restaurant was ok, the dinner I did not like. I will not come back again to this place and would not recommend it to my friends.

However the size of the double bed is quite small and not in line with other similar class hotels in Florida. Quite unconveniently we were provided with a connecting room, which despite having no knowledge or contact with the neighbours , allowed us to share their leaving , cooking and sleepong experience. Saddly enough, the neighbours also had a small child quite eager to get up from 07h00 each morning whereas his parents were not disposed to leave the bed until 08h00.... we heared and learned a great deal about child cryings.. The balconny with the anti mosquito net spread all along the lenghtgh of the 2 square meter balconny with no possibility to open it would not be quite suitable for people in search of a freedom experience, this rather gave a feeling of clostrophobia, or sharing a prison inmate stay. Let's not talk about the cleaning of the room which was left to a minimum during our 5 days experience, Only after we complained to the reception were the sheets changed and the bathroom's floor properly clean after the 4th days whilst as per the reception guidelines the room are supposed to be 100% serviced every day. The location of the hotel also seems to be closed to a fire station, which from a safety point of view could be a good thing if it was not for the fire service to use the vehicle alarm on at every time of the night and days...

Good sized room which is well equipped with Queen size bed, TV, DVD player, CD player/alarm clock, ceiling fan. Room also houses a small kitchen with microvave, fridge, sink, coffee maker and toaster but no cooker/grill. Hilton also provides washing up liquid and cloths/kitchen towels are replaced daily. There is a small balcony with table chairs. Rooms are cleaned/beds made daily. Room has air conditioning which was our only real complaint. The studio room was linked to a larger apartment whose air conditioning dial controlled both rooms! This was fixed once early in the holiday only to get back to Arctic conditions a few days later when new guests moved in next door. A change of room was then offered and no issues seen after this. Didn't use the pools much but here is plenty of space/sun beds. We had meals twice in the pool side bar in the evening. OK and prices are reasonable but not a great range of food. Note the hotel doesn't have a separate restaurant and while we were there it was cool in the evening. They have plastic covers that they bring down around the edge of the restaurant with gas heaters on for cool December evenings. The hotel has a well stocked shop with prices competative. As we arrived back late several evenings we used the Pizza Hut Express outlet which you access though the shop. Again very good. Although ok with information on theme parks/malls, didn't feel hotel guest services were helpful with public transportation. We didn't have a car but they had no information on getting around by bus and so had to do our own research which is detailed below. Unlike other comments, I think this hotel is well placed for Disney/Universal if you don't have a car. The hotel run a free courtesy bus to Universal at 8.20 that gets you there just before opening calling at Sea World on route returning at 7.00, 8.00 and 9.00 from the bus depot at Universal. The hotel do run a shuttle to Disney at $12 pp return but this gets you there well after opening. A better option for Disney is to catch the Lynx 50 bus that goes directly to Magic Kingdom. Take a right outside the main hotel entrance walk across the road before you get to the lights. Cross the main junction staying on the same side of the road. Bus stop is marked and is 200 yards from the main hotel entrance. Costs $1.50 pp each way (need exact change) and buses are every 30 minutes. The 8.10 am bus gets you the main Disney transportation hub for around 8.40. This links into Magic Kindom and Epcot by monorail and Disney MGM/Animal Kingdom by Disney bus (all free). Buses are every 30 minutes (01 & 31) in the evening with last bus 11 pm. There is also a Lynx 8 bus get gets you to International Drive/shopping malls. Go onto the Lynx web site and you can get schedules. One other thing about buses not generally known is that is if you want to get to a destination on Lynx that needs a change of bus you can ask for a transfer ticket so you don't pay your $1.50 on the second bus. I trolley also picks up directly outside the hotel (stop 34) and this is another convenient option for shops/restaurants on International Drive. Buses run every 20 minutes. $1 pp exact change needed. There is nothing around the hotel that is walking distance.

From the moment of arrival until check out, the experience was very good and we have no complaints about anything. When we arrived at the guard gate, the young man greeted us by name and said everything was all ready for our check-in. The desk staff was very friendly and welcomed us and we were checked-in in less than 2 minutes. There were certificates for 2 complimentary bottled waters (Hilton Honors benefit) good at the convenience store. The room was what we expected - spacious and well equiped. The first night there was a light bulb out in the bedroom, but it had been replaced on the 2nd day without us reporting anything. We were not expecting housekeeping services, except for one time, but we had service every day of our stay. Extra laundry soap, coffee, and bath products were left daily. We made our own beds, but the housekeeper smoothed and straightened them out daily. We did not receive one call to listen to a time share presentation. The phone was ringing when we first arrived at the room, but the caller had hung up before we could answer. Maybe that was the time share call. There were two large screened balconies with ceiling fans . We looked out at the corner of the tennis court, so everything was very quiet. The beds were comfortable and the tub was a welcome sight after so much walking throughout Disney World. There were TVs and DVD players in each bedroom and a large rear projection TV in the living room, along with a stereo and DVD player. The housekeeper ran the dishwasher for us daily, even though it wasn't full and probably could have waited another day. The bar and pool-side restaurant were reasonably priced and had friendly staff. We used the Pizza Hut twice. There is a delivery charge plus gratuity added for delivery to the room, so it's better to order it from the store and carry it back to your room. The small convenience store was well stocked and reasonably priced. We did not have trouble parking, even when coming back late at night. The location of the Hilton was very convenient to the I-4 and 528 Expressway. It was an easy 10 minute drive to Disney World and about 15-20 to the airport. Remember to bring lots of quarters for the 528 Expressway toll. It was 75 cents several times each way between the hotel and the airport. There is a Publix grocery store south of the hotel on International Drive near the other Hilton Grand Vacation Villa. There were also many restaurants near the Convention Center north of the hotel on International Drive. This was one of our best lodging experiences and we highly recommed this facility to anyone visiting the area.

It's easy to get from anywhere, just following the seaworld signs. Disney was about 10 minutes away, Universal as well. And lots of places to eat nearby. I highly recommend it.

I must say that I was quite disappointed with the resort in July, as my family and I had to contend with ants. Pest technicians were dispatched to our room (a two-bedroom apartment), but, unfortunately, they were unable to resolve the problem. This made our stay at the otherwise beautiful resort, very uncomfortable, as my family and I were afraid to freely use the bathroom, closet, and kitchen because of the ants. Although I wrote the resort manager and received a sincere response from him, I had vowed to never return to the resort. In September, I received an offer, through the HiltonHHonors program, to revisit HGVC. The offer was too good to turn down, so I reluctantly booked our stay. I notified the resort manager that my family and I would be returning to again to celebrate my daughter's 6th birthday at the Magic Kingdom. When I arrived the staff was wonderful, just as they were the first time. My daughter was eager to revisit the waterfalls and beautiful landscape of the resort. Our check-in was breeze, and the clerk even wished my daughter a happy birthday. This made my daughter beam with joy! Upon entering our room, we were greeted by birthday balloons and goodies that Mr. Hancock, the resort manager, and his staff had left for our daughter. This unexpected surprise truly made my daughter's day. This time, our room was clean, free of dust and ants. Everything seemed to be in working order. The location of the room was wonderful, as we had a corner room that I allowed us to leave our curtains open without staring at anyone else's patio. The room, like the other one in which we stayed, had a full kitchen (with all kitchen necessities from a toaster to dishwashing liquid), a spa tub, and a bathroom with a comfortably-sized shower, a large and nicely decorated living area, and a private screened patio. At the end of the evening of the day of our arrival, a staff member called to ensure that we had enjoyed the balloons and were pleased with our room. On the second day of our visit, we spent most of the day at Disney. When we returned to our room, we discovered the room to have been cleaned by the housekeeper and everything had been replenished nicely. I did not get a chance to revisit the pool in September, but I did visit it in July. The pools are wonderful! The largest pool has a large rock extending over it to create something almost like a cove and a waterfall. My family enjoyed the pool very much. There is a little stand that sells flip flops, water toys, etc., and we purchased a floating toy for my daughter to use at the pool. (The woman at this stand was very nice.)There are hot tubs surrounding the pool, and we enjoyed these, too. The landscaping is beautiful around the pool, and in certain areas, even provides a sense of privacy. All pools and hot tubs appeared to be well-maintained. The lounge chairs were in excellent condition and showed no signs of mildew. The tennis courts were well lit at night and appeared to be well-maintained, as well. I felt very secure as this resort, as it is gated, and the friendly security guards stopped anyone who did not have a resort guest tag around their rear-view mirror. Other positives I noted about this apartment included a washer/dryer combo the apartment (very convenient); clean, unworn carpets in the room, Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries, and internet access. Other positives about the resort include a store with Starbucks coffee, snacks, etc. The woman who assisted in the store was friendly and efficient. The decor of the resort is beautiful, with true island feel and beautiful wedding arch.

We also had snack foods for the late night cravings. My husband was so impressed that there was a washer and dryer in the room, he did laundry 2 days in a row and we all came home with clean clothes. :). I will definitely stay here again if it gets my husband to do laundry. LOL!!! My only complaint was the deli area.

Each separate building has a pool as well, although smaller and without the waterfall. We chose this hotel because we were doing two days at Seaworld and it was conveniently located and reasonable @ $139 thru Travelocity. When we first got to our room we tried to call the front desk and switch to a building closer to the main pool with the waterfall. Our room was clean and new and proximity to the other pool was our only reason to switch but after three calls to the front desk with no one picking up, we decided to skip it and make the 1/4 walk to the waterfall pool. I'll try not to offend anyone here but - when we got to the main building pool, it looked like a place where people were coming to gain weight. Ninety-five percent of the guests at the pool area were huge, overfed people, walking around with pizza boxes, to-go containers, and frozen drinks. All ages too! I found it a little stomach turning to see this gluttonous crowd of over indulgers with seemingly no regard for their appearance or health and it was a real appetite suppressant. so I had no desire for the on-site Pizza Hut or restaurant food. At around 5pm we headed back to our own building and pool, promising our kids one last quick swim before we changed clothes and headed to Seaworld for the nighttime show. Unfortunately, THE POOL AT OUR BUILDING WAS CLOSED FOR A PRIVATE PARTY AND WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER - despite our room overlooking the pool and so close to the party music. I thought that was pretty lame on the resorts part to rent out the pool - so you might make sure the pool in whatever building you're staying in isn't booked for a private party during your stay.

They need to install a/c in the elevators for sure. This would seem a no-brainer in a place as humid as Florida. In fact, if humidity bothers you, I would recommend a visit during the cooler months. I personally got headaches every day waiting in line for hours in the humidity to ride the rides at all the parks, but I may be more sensitive than some. Secondly, as you walk the grounds from your building to the main pool area, the tranquil setting is disturbed by the occasional foul smell of raw trash. Not sure why or where it came from, but it was strong and in several locations. Other than that, the rooms are nice and spacious and have the feel of an apartment. Lots of nice pools. Kids everywhere since school is out. Nothing spectacular, but clean and comfortable accomodations for a family on vacation in Orlando.

That worked out perfectly for our little ones who were only good for about 4 hours before melting down. We didn't try to do Disney from here, we were having too much fun at Seaworld.

Full kitchen with every gadget you could want, a big table to eat at, a good size living room, screened in porch with table and chairs. The bedroom was also a good size. DVD player in the living room and bedroom. The hotel is very clean and our rooms were spotless! In June we were lucky enough to be in the Somerset building which was a 2 minute walk to the pool. The two main pools were great and our 3 year old loved the kiddie pool and had fun playing with the other kids in it. There were alot of activities for children to participate in, some had a fee, some did not. A few nights there are dive in movies at the pool. The bar and grill by the pool has good food and a good children's menu. There is also a good shop for food with a Pizza Hut inside. At the beginning of our stay the hotel was not too crowded but the day before we left the summer crowds arrived and I was glad we left when we did.

When we got there some tickets we ordered over the internet were not there, so I was freaking out because we needed them for that night! Roni from customer relations got on the phone with the people and fought with them to try and work it out. Finally I cancelled with the outside company and Hilton got me the tickets CHEAPER! Most resorts would just give you the number to the place and send you on your way, HGVC made sure we were covered. Thank you Roni and Jose! We had a two bedroom lockoff very close to the pools which was great. It was beautiful, clean and very spacious. One thing some people may not like is that they do not clean your room everyday, actually they only clean it half-way through your stay. To me I loved it because nobody was bothering me, waking me up in the am and moving my things. I did not mind having to wash the towels and dishes once in awhile, we just turned on the dish washer and the clothes washer before we left in the am. My only complaint about the resort was our elevator in Pembroke House. It was slower than the turtles out back, but we made it through so it's all good hahaha. Plus on the top floor I was not all about lugging stuff up the stairs! We got food from the Pizza Hut on site as well as the deli there. The food and everything else available was good but it was also pretty expensive. I would recommend going just outside the resort to Publix to buy food and if you want to order in call Orlando Pizza. All of the service at the hotel was great, everything there was beautiful and clean. The pools and hot tubs were immaculate.

The crowd was really decent. The grounds of the resort are immaculate and the staff is always friendly. The accomodations are excellent! We did have a few problems though. It took two dys to resolve the internet connection, the safe was locked with a password upon our arrival. A request to correct the problem was redmediated immediately. However, something happened with the safe's mechanics that it opened and closed contiously until its battery ran out. We were not able to use it thereafter. We used the Parish pool ,which we we were told by the person who booked the accomodations , was for adults only and it is printed on the hotel brochure as the adult pool. Well it is not. However, it is less noisy and less busy than the other two pools. One draw back is that on both days that we visited the restrooms at the Parish pool they were in need of servicing. Just digusting!!! We were at the pool for 2 hrs on one occassion and three on another. We called guest relations to inform them and they were apologetic to no avail. Then on our last full day our room had not been cleaned as of 5pm when we returned after being out since 9am. We called and it was done immediately, but supplies were not replenished.

I was nervous about the exchange, but I could not have been more pleased with our accomodations. The condo was huge, with more than enough room for our family of six. With two kids 7 and 9, and two teenage boys, it was the perfect size for us. We had so much space that no one got in anyone's way. The unit was very clean, with all the amenities and comforts of home. The kitchen was fully stocked, the master bathtub was awesome, great to relax in after a day at the theme parks. I especially like the extra large shower in the master bath. We had so many tvs that no one was fighting over what to watch. There was even a big screen in the living room. We had two screened patios. The washer and dryer also came in handy, with complimentary Tide. Our room was close to the main entrance and lobby. The grounds were immaculate. We found the staff to be friendly also. The resort was conveniently located to all the major theme parks. Seaworld was right across the street and served as our marker to get back to the resort at night. It was close to all the action on International Drive, without all the traffic and congestion. Renting a car here is a must to get around and enjoy all the area has to offer. There is a grocery store and outlet mall about 10 minutes from the resort. My only recommendation is more parking, b/c we returned late to the resort most nights and parking was pretty scarce. I also like the security at the gate every night. Although we didn't participate in any of the scheduled activities, we were at Disneyworld and Universal Studios, there seemed to be plenty to do at the resort each day. I will definitely stay here again. I was even a little disappointed that no one asked me to do a timeshare presentation, b/c I would be very interested in ownership at this resort.

The activities area for kids was always having pool side games and activities going on and the pools and fitness center were very nice. They have a great masseuse on the property as well. We were a bit disappointed that we did not have pool side servers from the hotel bar/restaurant. However, you the bar/restaurant was right on the pool deck and easy to access. The hotel is across the street from Sea World, although I don't think it would be a fun walk. We actually took the complimentary shuttle, since the traffic was crazy around the resort. The location is friendly to Disney and Universal, about a 15 minute drive to both. We went up International Drive to eat and shop each day, and other than the traffic, it was easy to get to/from the resort.

The accomodations were great for our group. There was a studio suite attached to our 2 BR unit, so it was perfect for my mother in law. That room had wonderful decorating, a mini kitchen, dinette and balcony. It would be perfect for a couple and also had a sofa with tv, etc. I preferred the decorating in the studio suite to the decorating in our 2BR. The 2BR villa was very spacious and had a nice layout. We love having a washer/dryer and full kitchen which we always utilize for breakfasts and snacks. With 2 small kids the washer/dryer is a necessity for week long trips for us. We stayed in the Pembroke building which was a short walk to the main pool. I would ask to be near the main pool since our walk was far enough and I don't think I would have enjoyed the outer buildings even though they have a second, smaller pool area closer to those. The grounds of the property were pretty but were in need of maintenance. The buildings were in pretty good shape on the outside and inside apart from a general feeling of \"grime\" in some areas like greasy dirt on the walls in some places, door handles, doors, etc. I am a clean freak and it really wasn't horrible, but I not accustomed to this at DVC properties. The location of the resort is decent, but it does take a while to reach Disney parks. This was kind of frustrating to our family, but we felt the same about the Marriott Grande Vista when we stayed there last year, and it's just a function of location. We would prefer to stay in Lake Buena Vista near the Downtown Disney entrance. It was a convenient location for Universal Studios however. The staff at the HGVC were wonderful. From the nice woman who checked us in from S. Africa, to the activities director, to the guy who brought our missing cookie sheet - everyone was friendly and nice. There are loads of activities on site and we only took part in a few. The dive-in movie was a lot of fun at night. It is probably the type of place you could stay for several days and never leave, but we never are able to just relax where we stay. The main pool was beautiful and clean, and there is a covered kids playground, a kids pool, a waterfall pool, and another kids playground all in the main area. The grill was slow and the food just ok, but it was also nice having a little convenience store on site with a deli. We would consider staying at the HGVC again if we found another great deal, but realized how much we miss staying on site at Disney and the trade-offs would only be worth it to us if we needed a 3BR villa if traveling with family again.

The hilton is beautiful. The pools were wonderful, just like the pictures. There was plenty of places to sit or layout around the pool and plenty of towels that were provided by the hilton. The rooms were clean and we loved having the kitchen and laundry. The dryer was not very efficient, it took about 3 times to dry and load. Sometimes we would just take stuff out and hang it to dry. The kitchen has the basic necessities. The coffee they provide for the coffee maker is really weak and tasteless. Buy coffee in the gift shop or bring your own. The hilton at sea world was in a perfect location for us. It is only about 3/4 mile from highway 4 that you use to get to disneyworld. It only took us around 10-15 minutes to get wherever we wanted to go. I do think you need a car to stay at this resort. There are no restaurants nearby and the grocery store is around 4-5 miles away. The first night we arrived we drove the publix grocery store and stocked up on groceries. We fixed breakfast in the room and then packed up sandwiches, and snacks for day trips. We took an insulated backpack with us to disneyworld and put our sandwiches and some extra drinks in the pack and then stored them in a locker there. We would get to the park when it opened, ride the most popular rides and then take a lunch break and head to the locker. In this way we saved a ton of money and didn't waste time standing in line to buy lunch. Bring a water bottle that you can refill at the park. We would buy some treats at the park later in the day. Disney tells you that you can't bring in food from outside of the park but they only inspect it (like they do all bags) and let you take it in. We ate dinner out each night, which was nice. Try Bahama Breeze it's wonderful (call ahead and put your name on the list so you don't have to wait long). The only complaint I had about this resort is the elevators! They only have 1 elevator per building and there around 500 rooms per building. You end up waiting a lot, since it is incredibly slow and there is no air conditioning in it. If you decide to stay here, I would request a room on the upper floors (inspite of the elevator). We stayed on the 5th floor towards the end or the building and it was very quiet. Make sure your room is not near the elevator since people come back sometimes late in the evening and they can be noisey. Staying on a upper floor also eliminates noise from the parking area. Also make sure that your room is in a building that is relatively close to the pool. It looks like some of the buildings are pretty far away and you will spend a lot of time walking to the pool.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation for Family!\u201d", "Author": "lala4646", "ReviewID": "UR5354537", "Content": "We had a Fabulous vacation at the HGVC Sea World!

The staff were great and were able to store our luggage until checkin. Beautiful Resort in a Fabulous Location at the South End of International Drive, not even 5 minutes from Sea World. Just a word of caution the resort doesn't tell you about. Make sure that if you take a taxi, it has a meter, otherwise they can and will rip you off. The resort doesn't give you this information unless you ask. Everyone needs to be familiar with the \"I Ride\". It provides transportation from the South End of International Drive all the way up to the North End of International Drive.

Trust me it is worth it to do the research, especially on hot days (it has AC). There is a website that gives you all of the information, just look up \"I Ride Orlando Florida\" Also be careful who you get to transport you from the Airport to the Hotel, one of the Shuttle companies charged us $190.00 roundtrip (What a ripoff) You can get a taxi for about $40-$50.00 one way.

Every night we were home, we watched the SeaWorld fireworks from out beautiful screened balcony. The kids loved the pools and we adults loved the convenience to shopping, parks, International Dr, etc. You do need a car if you want to venture off the hotel grounds, but it is a short drive to everything. We were always able to find lounge chairs at the pool for all of us, although the kids rarely came out of the pool(s) while we were there. Bedrooms were spacious, everything was clean, the view was nice (SeaWorld to the left, pond with fountain to the right). The only complaint I have is that the elevator in our building was the slowest elevator I have ever ridden in. Great fun for the kids though...they raced the adults in the elevator by taking the stairs, and the kids won every time! Plenty of activities for kids at the pool, every day, all day.

We decided to stay over for Mother's Day weekend. Booking a two bedroom suite for the Mrs., myself and the two teenage daughters. The unit was very spacious with a kitchen, family room, 2 bedrooms and seperate baths. Each room had a seperate screened balcony that afforded a million dollar view. The master bedroom contained a private (and VERY romantic) Jaccuzi tub...dont forget your bubbles and candles! :-) The family room sported a wide screen TV, and the others had 32 inch CRT units, each with a DVD player... the girls room had its own microwave and sink...how appropriate. We found that one can rent DVDs in the on site store at the Bermuda Clubhouse. This store has ample supplies and even a Pizza Hut so you don't have to leave the premises after a hard day of playing \" theme park warrior\". The accomodations are truly CLEAN which is important to us modern Germ Freaks! in fact close inspection with a portable black light revealed on of the cleanest, dust free, organism free sites we have ever tested! (Yeah, I know its extreme...but thats us!) As a previous poster mentioned, you can walk to Sea World, and International Drive is just a stones throw. There are many wonderful places to eat there. We highly reccomend Ming Garden for the Oriental cuisine. Ming met our standards in all aspects and is one culinary destination that will be revisted by this clan. I must say that we are picky about where we stay and what we eat, and I could find no fault with HGVC. The staff was wonderful too. The only issue I had was trying the express check out (just to see if it worked)...... it did not. However, Mr. Vince Bourque, the Guest Ops Manager was right there on the spot asking what he could do for anyone. He quickly had us on our way to Mothers Day Brunch with no worries. (kept me out of big trouble... thanks Vince!) Hilton Grand Vacations can be anything you want it to be... family time... time for you.. time with the spouse....reflection, relaxation.

It was NOT a full, and our feet were actually hanging off the bed (neither of us is a large person, either). The so-called Queen and the pillows were as hard as rocks, and the blankets actually had holes in them where they had been worn through. The other annoying thing about this hotel was the noise. We were in a room next to the \"Trash\" room (the room where housekeeping stashes their cart), and every morning at 7 AM we were awakened by several LOUD housekeepers yelling at each other in Spanish. It was so loud, I actually opened my door to see what all the commotion was about, and I noticed that several other perturbed guests were doing the same. Since I figured complaining to the front desk would have only made it worse the next day, we decided just to cover our ears with our rock-hard pillows. The 2nd to last day, we were awakened (again at 7 AM) by a maintenance guy using a leaf blower on the hallway outside our room. If you have ever used a leaf blower, you know that they are LOUD!

It was our first trip to Orlando with a young family i.e. 2 adults and two kids aged 1 and 4. We arrived on an early flight and knew we would likely have to wait for our room to be ready at the 4pm check in time. While we waited we changed into our swim suits and enjoyed the pool and had a bite to eat at the poolside pub. We were offered earlier check in at 3pm but it was in Building 8, quite a distance from the main pools, so we opted to wait and ended up in Building 3 which was very convenient. The first two days we were there were very busy, which didn't bother us, but our last 5 days the resort was only 1/2 full which made it that much nicer. A list of the pros/cons as follows Pros - Great Room - 1 bedroom suite with king size bed, double pull out in living area, jacuzzi tub, dining room table, full kitchen, washer/dryer - having 2 small kids having the kitchen was perfect. We bought our supplies at the Publix supermarket and ate quite a few meals in our apt. Family atmosphere - lots of families with small kids which was great for our 4 yr old to play with other kids in the pool and in hindsight we are glad we did not rent a house. They had activities throughout the day but we did take advantage of many. One night they showed a movie out by the pool on a big screen which was kinda fun. Location - I liked the location of the resort as it was within walking distance of Seaworld. To get to any restaurants and shopping you did need to use transit (which we did and made out fine) but for 4 days we rented a van which was that much better. If we went again I would rent a vehicle for the whole time. Disney was about a 15 min drive and easy to find. Parking - free parking and lots of it Cons - Eating - it would have been nice to have another choice of restaurant at the resort. We ate at the pub on the first day when we arrived and the food was just average. Put a good restaurant on site and it would be a gold mine as there are no places to eat within walking distance of the resort other than the one pub. Service - just average. We had to chase down a housekeeper to clean our room, but overall not bad enough for us not to go again. The Conceirge wasn't the best. We asked a different staff for suggestions on where to eat, but there recommendations were limited ie. the one girl suggested the Outback as a \"nice\" place to go which I'm sure is fine but we can go there anytime. We went to a place called Salt Island which I would recommend and also Olive Garden (chain) which had good service and the food was also good. I have no problem recommending this resort and if we were to go to Orlando again, I probably would stay there again. The rooms with kitchen made our stay very easy with kids and enjoyable.

We had a one bedroom suite with large jacuzzi tub, full kitchen, living room, two T.V's, washer/dryer, vacuum, iron and ironing board, large bathroom with shower and double sinks and a screened in porch with table and chairs. Room was very well maintainted and the decor was typical Florida.

There are two other pools by the restaurant and lobby, as well as a small lake. We ate lunch at the restaurant on property one day. Having the kitchen we were able to have breakfast before leaving on our adventures for the day. We had pizza hut delivery one evening from the on site restaurant. Housekeeping service is only once every few days, however they provide you with enough extra's if needed (sheets, blankets, towels). Read up on some information about Discovery Cove while there which is just down the street from HGVC. It is operated by Sea World/Bush Gardens. It sounds very nice for a full day adventure that includes swimming with the dolphins, lunch and a 7 day pass for Sea World and Bush Gardens. The concierge at HGVC advised that it is booked up in advance as much as 5 months, and quoted approximately $300.00 per person. If interested read up about it and book prior to your trip.

My son who is 14 also thanked her as he was happy that he wouldn't be sleeping on the sofa bed now. She accepted our thanks and then directed us to our room. We had requested to be near the pools, instead we were two buildings away, a nice healthy walk to the pools. When we got to our room we were surprised to see it was only the one bedroom we had booked. There was a door that was locked and attached to our living room that was the second bedroom so we called the woman who checked us in and asked her if they wer going to be opening the second bedroom and she said that we only booked a one-bedroom. I said, I know that but you offered us a second bedroom as an upgrade and as you stated \"for not additional charge.\" She denied ever offering that like we had made the whole the thing up and it was only 10 minutes after our conversation. I said to her that if she made a mistake she and offered something that wasn't available she should just admit it rather than treat us like we are crazy and didn't have the conversation. The next day we were contacted and asked if everything was okay when we explained the above situation we were told our complaints would be forwarded and were we intersted in a time share presentation. We never received an apology for the above situation. The carpeting, upholstery and bed spreads seemed dirty and unsanitary. One day no one showed up to clean when we got in at 10 pm. and inquired they sent someone from housekeeping with towels when I asked if she was going to clean she said \"You clean tonight we clean tomorrow.\" Then she acted like she couldn't understand me when I said you mean, you aren't going to clean tonight? She just kept repeating herself - You clean tonight - we clean tomorrow. No apology - just you clean tonight we clean tomorrow. Last but not least, the water smelled disgusting. This could be a Florida thing, but it smelled like sewage when your ran the bath, took a shower or brushed your teeth. My 2 year old drank some water when brushing her teeth, tasted it spit it out and started to gag. It was really gross but maybe I am just used to Chicago non-smelling water.

We arrived at the hotel at 11:00am and were very pleased that we could check into our room right away. Our group consisted of 4 adults and 2 children ages 12 and 9. We rented a 2 bedroom unit and were given the ground floor of building 7000. All buildings do have elevator access. You enter the unit from the kitchen in an open concept idea that then leads you to the dining area and then living room area which has a large flat screen tv, dvd player and pull out couch. To the left was the queen size bed and pull out couch (new mattress on pull out couch) bedroom. This bedroom also had a tv and dvd player. It also had a small kitchen area with a fridge, sink, cupboards...the bathroom was a shower/bath combo. The water took a while to warm up but in reality it really did not matter. We also had patio doors that led to an outdoor porch. To the right of the kitchen was the master bedroom again with tv and dvd player. This bedroom had a king size bed with a 2 person jacuzzi tub and make up area. The shower area which was seperate from the jacuzzi area had a nice large stand up shower and 2 sink area. This bedroom also had patio doors leading to an outdoor porch area. The unit came with a washer, dryer, dishwasher, ice making machine in the fridge, iron, ironing board. There was also a free safe in the master bedroom closet which you entered your own code. There are three closets in the whole unit and dressers in both bedrooms. We found more or bigger drawers in the dressers would of been better for all the clothing we had. They did supply extra linens, pillows, travelling size shampoo, conditioner, soaps, dishsoap, tide, papertowels, toilet paper, garbage bags and sml coffee pouches. The chambermaids did come to our unit once to replenish and clean. There is a tennis court and basketball court (which unfortunately is not lit at night). By unit 7000 and 8000 you will find the adults only pool that has a hot tub, bathroom/changeroom and towel area. The other pools (2) are near the front desk area. They are heated and you will find many toddler pools and hot tubs which are also heated. Towels are also supplied here (as many as you want all day). In this area you will also find the outdoor restaurant (good food), shuffleboard, play area for children that has a rubber flooring, childrens sand playing area with sand toys, hair braiding ($), tattoos ($), pool table, ping pong tables (balls are .25$ each), a little variety hut/store (suntan lotion, sunglasses...), they also rent air mattress's for the pool at $5.00 an hr. Upstairs there is a souvenir/deli/grocery shop. During our stay we did see a croc or alligator in their pond area. The kids just loved this!!! The children did do some activities in the kids club and enjoyed them. They do different activities by the pool everyday. One of our favorites was the ice cream sundays at $3.00 each. This resort is near the major attractions and international drive which is very convenient. On our last day we were able to check out later then the scheduled check out of 10am. We flew Southwest which was very pleasant. The only downfall of Southwest was that we were always category \"B\" to fly being that people who went on the internet received all the \"A\" boarding. On this flight they served peanuts, trail mix, juices, tea or coffee, pop and mixed drinks (at an additional cost). Remember your luggage cannot exceed 50pds each. This is really reenforced.

The pools were big, warm and gorgeous, one has a huge waterfall that the kids loved playing under and another had a huge fountain in the middle. Two hot tubs and tons of stuff for the kids to do at the pool if they wanted to. They even have a movie theater and show dvds. The front desk was excellent as our plane was delayed three hours. The gym was adequate. They have 24 hour security who will give you a ride in their golf carts. The only small issue was the food. there is only one restaurant with good enough but not great food for dinner and lunch (the kids had breakfast once there and it was not very good). because it is at the pool all drinks, including wine are served in plastic cups. after a long day out, we found ourselves wanting to stay in. we had a car but no one felt like driving any where and the hotel is not within walking distance of any other restaurant. But this was not enough of a reason not to stay here. They have a provisions store which has starbucks,wine, sandwiches, snacks and everything you could have forgotten - this was excellent! I have been to Orlando at least 8 times and this was THE BEST place i have stayed (I don't stay at the parks). The price was extremely reasonable. No one tried to sell us anything and we were treated excellently. We spent most of our time at Universal but it was an easy, no traffic, ride up a side road to the park from this hotel (although coming out of Universal we couldn't always find the short cut back because of the way the parking deck sends you). To stay in this hotel you need a car and it is not exactly next to the restaurants on International Drive. I used the reviews on this site to pick this hotel and it was better than i expected.(I spent hours pouring over the reviews and all the travel sites) I give it an excellent because it is better than a 4. It may not be a full 5 becasue of the food, but with a little better planning for dinner the food would not have been an issue. This is a great place i'd say a 4.5++.

This is the 3rd time I've been a guest at this resort in the past 6 years. This was my first time with my son (3 yrs) We were in a 3 bedroom unit as timeshare guests trading out through RCI. Our room was in the Sandy building. I was unsure of the layout of the 3 bedroom prior to our arrival because the resort doesn't feature room layouts on their website and on our previous stays we had been in a 2 bedroom unit. I was very pleased to find that it was not a 2 bedroom unit with a 1 bedroom lock off. It was a fully contained 3 bedroom unit with 3 baths. 2 master bedrooms, one with a king, one with a queen and the 3rd had 2 double beds and a full hall bath. The unit was in great shape. Very clean. I wasn't present at check-in but I didn't hear any complaints and the unit was ready a half-hour early. Very comfortable... 2 small sofas and 2 chairs. Large dining table that could seat 8. The previous 2 bedrooms units had a big screen tv, this one had just a tube tv, but I don't consider that an inconvenience. We didn't ask for a mid-week cleaning but we were offered clean towels, toilet paper, paper towels and such by the staff mid-week. The grounds are perfect, there was always someone working on the landscaping, they scrubbed the hallway floors, scrubbed the hall railings and removed and cleaned all the exterior lights in our building during the week we were there. We used both childrens playgrounds. One for older kids and one tot lot with sand for the little guys. The slide was \"out of order\" in the tot lot, a crack in the fiberglass. We used both pools. Clean, lots of activities going on for the kids. Plenty of seating. We had lunch at the grill by the pool twice. Both meals were good. Better than your average hotel cuisine. The deli and convience store was nicely stocked and the food was good. We were in the end unit closest to the road and I was a little bit aware of the road noise. I don't recall that in our previous stays so I think it was the location of this room. I wouln't consider it a distraction. Lots of activities for children, we didn't end up taking advantage of them because of the age of our child, but for kids a little bit older I think there were a lot of options. I would consider it an excellent property with a great location. We stayed 2 days following the week at HGVC at Star Island and there was no comparison. I can't think of any negatives... the water pressure was kind of low in the shower... the dishwasher was pretty noisy so run it when you plan to be out... that's the worst I can come up with.

My sister and her two children (6 and 7 yrs old) and my husband and I with our two children (12 and 14 years old) each had a one bedroom accomodation in the Devonshire building. The rooms were lovely - full kitchens, nice seperate bedroom for the adults, more than acceptable pull out sofa bed for the kids, large bathroom, seperate jacuzzi and screened-in balcony. It was clean and nicely decorated. The rooms had a DVD player with DVDs to rent at the grocery store which was a nice touch. The staff were friendly, always saying hello when you passed them. The pools were clean with plenty of towels. The pool side restaurant was fine, with friendly service. The grocery store also served Starbucks coffee which more than adequately addressed our daily required caffeine fix. The reception staff accomodated our request for the two rooms in the same building. Grounds staff passing in golf carts always stopped to ask if we needed a ride to our building which was a pleasant relief after walking back one evening from Sea World with tired children.

The studio I stayed in was excellent. It was right next to the pool. I liked the fact that I had a screened outdoor patio attached to my room. The room was a nice size with fridge, microwave, couch, table and 2 chairs. I had a double door closet which enclosed a vacuum, broom, iron and ironing board, extra linens and even a laundry basket. Housekeeping cleaned everyday. They even cleaned the coffee pot and even though I made my bed every morning, they still replaced the sheets. This was the best get away from home and kids ever. I liked the fact that the hotel always had activities going on. They had activities for kids as well as adults. I had the luxury of taking the free Casino Cruise which was really nice. I had planned to attend the wine tasting the next night but was too exhausted from the overnight cruise. All in all I will definitely return back to this hotel. It was great. It was like having my own apartment not an enclosed smelly hotel with mildewy carpet. The floors were tile in the entry and bathroom. With as much rain as Orlando gets I thought that was very wise. I often visited places in Orlando where the mildew smell would hit you as soon as you walk in. This was great. I can't understand why it wasn't rated a 5 star.

His sister and her husband belong to this vacation club, so they were able to get us, their parents, and their own family (3 kids 0 6, 7, and 13 years old) all separate rooms. We did not have to pay for the room, since it's part of their vacation club expenditure. We both prefer independent \"mom & pop\" type places, but no such thing exists in the Orlando/Theme Park metropolis anyway, and we decided to just go with the flow. The rooms were very nice over all, clean, good size. However, my sister-in-law requested a room change after the 1st night, when she realized she should have been in a better room due to her \"premium\" status as a vacation club member. She also had some maintenance concerns - front door would not unlock and open easily, microwave door would not shut, etc... The 1st room was a suite in which we all had our own bedrooms and bathrooms (and we even had our own kitchenentte), but she had to share a bed, bathroom, and closet with her kids (her husband was out of town for this vacation). The nice thing about this 3 bedroom suite, is we all had our own private rooms, but they adjoined to a common living room, dining room, kitchen. After the room change, she got into her own suite with her own bathroom, bedroom, closet and her kids got their own bed, bathroom, closet - both rooms adjoined to a common living area again. Then we got our own separate room on another floor and her parents got one down the hall from us. So we had more privacy and a king size bed in the new room, but we all had to take an elevator and walk to meet each other - good, if you want more privacy from the family stuff. We had daily house cleaning service, but for some reason, they skipped my sister-in-law's room most days. She had to call several times to remind them. The pools and hot tubs were really nice. However, one evening we went down there after a typical daily summer Orlando rain storm to swim, and there were no clean towels available for 2 hours. The restaurant was OK and the deli/store was decent. They serve a good breakfast platter that is big enough for 2-3 people. This hotel has complimentary shuttles to Sea World and Univeral, but to get to all the Disney stuff they charge $10 for a round-trip shuttle, which only leave 3 times a day. We had rented a car anyway, but it came in handy when we wanted to separate. In the new room, there was no darkening curtains so it was very bright in the morning and hard to sleep in past sunrise, if you're a light sleeper. There was also young kids next to us who would shout early in the morning as they all got ready to leave. After they would leave, then we got to hear the house cleaners yelling, vacuuming, and /or even ringing our doorbell (there was no \"do not disturb\" sign on our door). I found it difficult to sleep in and relax. While the pools were nice, they were filled with tons of kids of all ages playing, yelling, running, etc.... This is a great place for families, but not relaxing at all for couples/people without children and/or people who want it quiet. The hotel also has scheduled activities throughout the day for the kids, which they seemed to really enjoy. If you go in the summer, start your days early. It rains every day some time between 3-6pm for at least an hour or longer. It usually clears up again, but not always.

Where do I start? We booked our stay online on the Hilton site which we were required to prepay to get the special pricing which was non refundable. We had requested an early check in (10am). When we arrived to the hotel I was told they had no rooms available yet which I expected but I asked if they could get a room ready for me soon and they said to check back at 12pm. Well needless to say when I came back at 12pm they still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a room for me which surprised me as there was only one other person waiting for a room at that point. My daughter had a soccer clinic in Winter Park that started at 1:00pm so I gave them my number and told them to call me when the room was ready. I received my call at 2:30 that my room was ready. When I arrived back to the hotel around 5:00pm and checked in I was given the key to a room in the Sandy unit. I had requested to not be placed by the elevator and guess where my room was. We were extremely tired and hungry at that point so I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to complain about the location and I was just happy to get a room. When we got to the room we noticed the door was propped open. Upon entering the unit I immediately noticed the refrigerator had been removed. No fridge just a hole. I was extremely pleased with the room, we booked a one bedroom. It was extremely clean, well appointed, newly painted, new tile, clean rug, etc. The layout is great and well designed. Being as we had groceries that required refrigeration I called the front desk to advise them of my situation. They told me they would have maintenance \"check into it\". After 30 minutes and no call back or maintenance man I called the front desk again for an update. They put me on hold to check and came back on the line to tell me they were not sure where they would get a refrigerator from. I told them to just move me to another room with a fridge. After a bit of looking they found us a room in another building I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the name but it was unit 8601. As we were preparing to move to the new room the porta crib we requested showed at the old room and we advised him of the new unit number and expected him to deliver it to the new room. When we got to the new unit boy were we shocked by the difference. This unit was well worn. Scuffed walls, missing base boards, blown light bulbs, dirty carpet, and damaged blinds. Additionally the tiles floors were horrendously dirty and had some sort of sticky syrup or beverage in various areas. The bathroom wall next to the toilet had what appeared to be feces smeared on the wall. I now see why there have been so many varying opinions on this place. As we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like moving again we accepted the room. After another 1/2 hour passed and we still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the porta crib I called again and they finally got it to us. After dinner my wife and I had a couple of drinks before bed and we placed the partly empty bottles on the nightstand. When I was cleaning up the next morning I went to empty the remaining contents and was disgusted to find a cockroach had crawled into one of the bottles. On the Saturday night before check out the front desk called at 10:00pm (too late to call in my opinion) to ask if they met all of our expectations. I advised them that they had not and went into a brief elaboration and all they said was \"oh I'm sorry\". The next morning we were harassed twice to check out. The check out time is 10:00am. At 8:30am housekeeping harassed my wife drilling her on when we planned to leave to which she responded that check out was at 10am and we would be gone by then. Around 9:30am another person who appeared to be from the front desk came to the door to ask the same question and we again answered by the 10am check out time. I found it strange that for a facility as large as this one who couldn't get us checked in before noon because they had no clean rooms would harass you to leave before the posted check out time. Hilton should be ashamed to have their name associated with this place. If you decide to stay here you apparently have a 50/50 chance at getting a nice room.

The two bedroom apartment we had was very spacious. If you go, like another previous review, ask for something closer to the lobby because that is where the nice pools and activities are. We had a 5-10 minute walk to go to the nice pools, services. Also, they DO NOT have a DVD in every room. You have to ask for it. We waited 2 days before we got one. We had great housekeeping services until the day after our friends went to the timeshare spiel and decided not to buy. After that, we had NO housekeeping services and had to call for fresh towels. We also had ill-fitting sheets on our bed. Every morning, my husband and I woke up with the fitted sheet bunched up between us. The restaurant was a disaster! We ate there the first night because we were too tired from traveling to drive anywhere. Our waitress, Lisa from Tulsa, did not know the first thing about waitressing. First, we did not get menus. After waiting for 10 minutes for menus, I got up and asked her for them. She apologized then threw some menus at me that were dripping with beer. It took her another 20 minutes to get our order. We had been there almost 45 minutes before we even had anything to drink. Our kids (there were 4 of them, including our friends' kids), all under the age of 6 were going nuts waiting for food. We noticed that another table with an even larger party that arrived after us, were taken care of much quicker. Lastly, when the bill arrived, a 16% gratuity had been automatically tacked on (because she said that even with half of us being toddlers/small children we were a party of 8). My friend was terribly put out by this and complained. So she took off the gratuity with barely an apology. That being said, we were happy with the service we received at the deli and with the childrens activities that our kids got to participate in.", "Date": "May 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cHGV Sea World Orlando\u201d", "Author": "offthewindow", "ReviewID": "UR3437961", "Content": "No real complaints about Hilton Grand Vacations Sea World.

The bathtub's faucet was extremely difficult to turn off fully and was the only glaring evidence that this was an \"older\" hotel with some miles on it. Check-in time isn't until 4pm and check-out time is 10am. We were leaving the room at 10 minutes after 10 and got a phone call \"reminding\" us to get out. (I don't think the fact that we didn't cave to the enormously pressured time-share sales pitch helped!) We stayed in the Warwick building where there is a pool behind it. The walk around the building was kind of a pain, but at least we were in a convenient unit! The pool was the best part of our stay.

It is a stones throw to Seaworld, but set well away from the busy street area. We could see Kraken(rollercoaster) from our patio. It is also only a 5 minute ride to Disney. It is a quick on and off the highway and suprisingly close. I think it was only one exit down from the Disney Buena Vista exit on Rte 4. It also has a great little market/deli inside that had everything we needed. They cooked up eggs, bacon, waffles every morning, but also sold milk, juice, poptarts, donuts, etc. for quick bites to get out quick to the parks. Everyone is very friendly.

Due to the fact that I had two reservations, I asked the customer service manger if we could remain in the same villa for all seven days of our trip. He said it was no problem.

Everything looked to be in very good condition, practically new. The bathroom was large with a glass-doored shower, and the whirlpool tub was set apart in an alcove off of the bedroom. It was absolutely huge. We did have an issue with the TV in the bedroom, but the management brought a new TV right away, although we still had a problem with the new one. But we didn't feel like bothering to have someone else up. We didn't pay for housekeeping, but someone came everyday and straightened up and did our dishes and gave us new coffee and laundry supplies. So, on an otherwise hectic schedule, that little bit of housekeeping was much appreciated. The grounds were absolutely beautiful. The pools were beautiful, however they are doing a bit of work on the cabanas. Lots of ammenities, like a theatre, children's activities and tennis/basketball courts. There is also a spa. We weren't at the resort a lot, but would never be bored if we were unfortunate enough to have had a rainy week. The only real downer of the room was that it was in the very last building on the property. The view out our window wasn't the nicest -- we were looking at the trucks and gravel and maintenance equipment. But one neat thing was that you could see the fireworks from Magic Kingdom way in the distance. We booked last minute. Any other building has much more beautiful views and plantings around it.
