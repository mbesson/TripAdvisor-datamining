I called the room guest and the front desk but no use I had to wait for the children to sleep at around 12:30am so that I could finally get myself a decent couple of hours of sleep before my flight ! I was just worried that the noise would wake up my child who was fast asleep at 8:30pm so if you can handle the heat, noise, sleepless nights then this is the hotel for you !! will I visit Istanbul again ? certainly ! will I ever consider staying at this hotel ?

The hotel is not the jazziest in the world but serves the purpose that a 5-star is supposed to. The location is very good being just off Taksim square and Istiklal Street which are in walking distance. There are loads of restaurants and pubs around for late night meals. Unlike some of the streets close-by, this one never got dark or dull as there are shops and other places near by. One added advantage is that the bus service (hawas) has its Taksim point very close to the hotel so you can travel from both the old or the new airports to this place easily without a cab. Bosphorous and Sultanahmet areas are close by 10-15 mins by cab. The service at the hotel was top notch. Right from the reception to the restaurant, the people there tried to make you feel most welcome and at home. Being our first visit, we had loads of questions and the people at the reception always had time to answer them. Would specially like to thank one gentleman 'Murat D' who was at the reception and took additional care to make us feel at home. The view from the hotel is something that is not the greatest given tall buildings around so that was a negative. The rooms are nice and clean. We were originally allotted a room that happened to be a corner room on 10th floor but was probably the smallest room at the hotel. On our request, the hotel gave us a better and bigger room within the same tariff on the next day. The food was average at best. The breakfast had a large menu but a few more vegetarian items would have made it even better. Given the size and number of rooms the breakfast lobby often was small and crowded.

Although we did have one case in which the service was below par - one member of staff dealing with an issue regarding our booked transport to the airport was less than helpful and rudely began checking in other guests in the middle of our enquiry - basically ignoring our request, without apologising or letting us know that she wasn't dealing with it. However once we made a complaint about this service the Guest Relations Manager sorted out our request and was very apologetic about her staff's behaviour. The rooms were clean and serviced every day, and the housekeeping staff were flexible in the times they were able to access the room (as we had late nights due to Ramadan, we were up later than most other guests, so the housekeeping staff would happily do our rooms once we had left.) Every room has a jacuzzi bath which after a long day of exploring the many sites Istanbul has to offer, is an excellent way to unwind! The swimming pool was nice, although you are asked to wear a swimming cap for hygiene reasons. I didn't personally use the gym or massage facilities, but other guests were impressed with both.

Undaunted---I headed to the Taksim Square at 6AM to find another hotel despite my travel agents message that \"everything in Istanbul that we'd like was sold out\"---and---to my wonderful luck some rooms had opened up at the Elite World Hotel, which is only about two blocks from Taksim Square and right in the area where night life, cafes, etc. begin. We stayed at the Elite World Hotel and had a fantastic stay---the rooms were wonderful (my was recently redone) and the location was fantastic, and I would absolutely stay there again. And while the breakfast buffet was good, the only demerit I can post about the Elite World was that the food is not great. Not horrible by any means---but not great---but there are so many other great places to go/eat nearby that this shouldn't stop you from staying there.

The wardrobe and storage areas were not particularly generous either \u00e2\u20ac\u201c adequate for a single person staying a few nights but not a couple staying a week. Then there was the awful view from the window \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was onto the roof top of the adjacent hotel just a few feet away, complete with satellite dishes and huge extractor fans. This really was quite appalling for a supposedly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. On the positive side, the furniture and fixtures were new and in good nick. There were many other disappointments, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mention just three: The entire hotel is serviced by only three lifts, which meant that at busy times the journey from the room to the lobby took all of ten minutes! Breakfast was a grim experience. There were far too many tables packed into a small space, which made moving from the table to the buffet bar something of an obstacle course going on dodgem rink. The food was really nothing special and frankly far below a quality you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect at a five-star hotel. On one morning we found the milk had curdled and set solid in the jug!

Please be careful if you are invited by some men (who are the managers of a nightclub very close to the hotel)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to mention the name of the nightclub but it is 3 or 4 blocks on the left when you get out of the hotel entrance. The name of the club sounds an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Asian country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I am saying this because my friend and myself have been overcharged (or cheated so to speak) paying more than USD 1500 for two girls sitting with us for about a couple of hours?? Their trick goes this way----- they will invite you and offer you with girls. They will tell your drink is TL 10 only but they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you that the time of the girls are for every 10 minutes you will be charged by TL 80\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and they will charge you with more than number of glasses the girls have actually consumed.. You will just be shocked when you receive your bill! ..and they will trick you to offer discount and at the end still it is very high. So be careful guys! I would suggest you ask the advice of the reception which nightclub to go. The hotel might have one or some recommendations. I am saying this because I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want other men tourists to end up with experiences just like what happened to us. Of course men like us wanted to go nightclubbing to have fun especially in beautiful city of Istanbul. And these people shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take advantage of that and that destroys the image of the Turkish rich and impressive culture. Please do not be tricked by the managers of the girls. You might be charged so much when they offer you a girl to sit on your table. So be careful!. You might consider bringing someone whom you know well or who will not cheat you. I would recommend the VERSAI nightclub in Ortakoy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is fantastic, trendy, they have good staff legit to deal with and real fun over there. We really did enjoy in VERSAI club! But I think you should be couple. Nevertheless, Elite Hotel is real perfect. My friend has selected it actually and we had fabulous stay on this hotel with nice and professional staff. Turkish way! They have complete and excellent facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e. sauna, gym, Turkish bath and massage rooms. They have fast internet connections.

I was told it was 50 TL. This was also the amount I paid when I arrived from the airport to the hotel with a metered taxi. I took one of the taxis in front of the hotel and asked the price. The taxi driver said \"meter-taxi\" which was fine with me as I expected it would come to 50 TL. He took the same road I took the first time from the airport to the hotel but when I arrived at the airport the meter it was almost 70 TL. Clearly, I was cheated by this taxi driver - so don't trust these guys and agree on a price beforehand. It is easy to manipulate a taxi meter. The guy who cheated me is driving a yellow Renault Megane with a red sticker on the back windscreen with the name of the Elite World Hotel and their website so they're closely connected.

OK, it's good they have their own food available but perhaps some European choice would be nice too) and also the lack of air conditioning which doesn't seem to work on the thermostat control . As mentioned in other reviews, the bathroom was pretty small considering the size of the room itself. The floor I was on (8th) was noisy and you could quite easily hear people outside in the corridor talking late at night. I would suggest avoiding the rooms near the lifts. The rooms on the 8th floor are the only standard rooms which have balconies and was good for views over the city. The location of the hotel in Taksim was close to the traffic (which itself is chronic with traffic jams most of the time) and quite noisy so had to keep the balcony door closed most of the time and you can hear the calling to mosque ampified at 6 am every day. The rooms were very clean and high standard although the bed in the room was very hard. Lots of freebies, including a bottle of water every day in addition to the tea/coffee making stuff and things.

We arrived at the Elite World late at night - no assistance at the door so we had to drag our bags up a steep, slippery ramp on our own. At reception, we're told that all floors above ground have been flooded so we're can't stay at the Elite for our first night. This is patently untrue - besides the fact that a flood of this scale could not be fixed overnight, we can see other guests going upstairs normally/checking in. We find out later that this hotel frequently overbooks and that when this happens guests who have merely guaranteed their booking by card (as opposed to paying in advance) get \"bumped\". Reception completely ignored the fact that moving from place to place would be very difficult for us as we were travelling with a 6 month old baby, besides the fact that it would take a lot of time from what was already a short trip. When we went to look at the other residence offered, we found out that it was much further than the Elite had said (10 mins drive as opposed to 5 mins walk!), that the only rooms available were doubles (we had booked a triple) and there was no cot for the baby. When we raised this with the Elite, we were told this was the only option available - if we weren't happy with it, we'd have to find another hotel ourselves - given that it was now after midnight and we were three girls with a baby, this was clearly impossible. Thankfully, the staff at the alternative residence were incredibly helpful and with their help we managed to get things sorted out - no thanks to the Elite, who did not even bother to give us any compensation for the trouble and inconvenience they caused to us.
