If you have naughty kids like mine, then be carefull, generally, people of Singapore don't like kids. I remember the expressions of that immigration officer when my kids were shouting for water.

The breakfast/cocktail menu was small compared to other club floor spread but it was very good nonetheless. The hotel is adjoined to a small shopping centre which had a chemist, wine shop, coffee shop etc which was handy to have. The hotel is maybe a 10 minute walk to Chinatown and to Maxwell Hawker Centre. It is not near an MRT station so maybe some people would not like that, but if you are taking taxis to get around Singapore then this hotel is pretty central. I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in a Club Room as I did, the staff there were so friendly and willing to go the extra mile.

Wednesday nothing, so I asked again. Wednesday evening when I returned, nothing, so I asked again on Thursday (morning) for an apology - again nothing when I returned.

I've grown to know some of the staff members, and it's always pleasant to be greeted by a smile from familiar faces, some already addressing me by my name (like Mr. Amin, Santi, Trina). For a frequent traveler like me, it makes every trip less stressful and more memorable whenever you stay at a hotel that makes you feel closer to home. However, I have noticed that over the years, service has deteriorated. While the front desk staff has been consistently courteous and warm, the room service staff, particularly the lady who always answers to take orders, lacks courtesy, always in a hurry and quite moody (sometimes she is flexible with tiny special requests, and sometimes she is not and won't budge). The old cleaning lady is also quite abrasive; once even taking my room key card out of the slot while i was away, and taking it with her! I understand the need to eco-save, but for me, I have always wanted to come back to a cool room, especially after a long and hard day at work. I did not like it that she got the key and took it away just like that. Lastly, I hope the hotel can also evaluate and improve its in-room dining presentation. I noticed that some dishes that I would regularly order, are not presented in a consistent manner. There are days when it is nicely put together, and there are days when, for the same dish, it doesn't have some of the usual add-on like jam, bread on the side, etc. When you're a regular guest, you easily notice these things and feel shortchanged when what you used to get is much better than what you're getting now. I stay in Amara not only because it's right across my office, but because I've learned to make my stay comfortable and easy here already.

The location is very ideal. It is in the southernmost part of the CBD, three blocks from the Tanjong Pagar MRT Station. It has a Fair Price grocery and a Seven Eleven across the street from the hotel. ATMs there as well. The room was more than adequate. The beds seems hard but actually are comfortable enough because I slept fine. Warning: for those that complain about every little noise, you may love this hotel. The A/C makes no noise so it is dead quiet in the room at night. Not much street noise at all (up on the 10th floor at least). I'm used to a little noise in the room from the A/C. So just saying, for those that just hate every little noise in the natural or man-made world, this hotel is definitely for you. As for a higher floor. The staff here was great. They were attentive to all of my needs including lost luggage from the airport and internet setup. They also took care of calling taxis. The staff at this hotel really was first rate. The 6th floor pool also is wonderful. It is very long, like a lap pool, but still wide enough too. It looks fabulous. I'll try to add pictures. I didn't try the gym or the tennis court. Newspapers were in the elevator lobby every morning. The ice machine on the 10th floor didn't work but the one on the 9th did. The elevators are room key access above a certain floor. Room service was performed very well also. The bathroom does not lock and has one of those clear type windows on the door but you can't see through it. I prefer private bathrooms but this one wasn't such a big deal. I mean, you can tell when someone is in the bathroom so don't walk in on them. The rainfall showerhead was nice. We ate at the Chinese restaurant on site on the second floor and it was very good. It was expensive, but very good. I would recommend it for certain. You are a good 20-30 walk from Chinatown and Clarke Quay from this hotel. It's a long walk. Fine for in the morning just starting out but horrible by the end of the day when you're tired, hot and sweaty. Taxi's all know this hotel and the MRT is close by also. So basically, if you're a person who wants to be in the middle of action, such as Chinatown, Clarke Quay or shopping, then you may want to try to look closer to Clarke Quay or Orchard Road.

Chinatown is also 5 minutes away by taxi, Also there a 24/7 supermarket just across the street to the right of the hotel with a bank and a 7/11 store right in front of the hotel for all your daily needs.

Off course, there were goods and bads about this hotel, but for me, this hotel ticks most of the boxes. The main reasons for me to choose this hotel again and again were simple. It's near business district, close to MRT, close to Chinatown (so it's easy to get food/drinks at anytime), not too expensive, has decent facilities and away from hustle bustle craze of Orchard. Rooms Clean, decent size and have standard amenities. Two complimentary bottled water everyday. Sheets and pillows are clean and smell fresh. Bathroom has standing shower and bathtub. Water taps worked fine, but I must admit the pressure and temperature were most of the times inconsistent, means it took quite a while to get the water from shower meet your desired temperature, especially from cold to hot. Toilettries are standard, incl. hairdryer. TV has decent numbers of channels. Staff In my opinion, quite efficient, but maybe not at anytime helpful. Check-in/check-out was fast. Some housekeeping staff were not really fluent in English (from China?), so it was like hit and miss to get them understand what you want. Location This is the ultimate reason I choose this hotel. It was a walking distance from Tanjong Pagar MRT, and Tanjong Pagar MRT is part of the airport line (East West/Green line), so from Changi airport, you only have to change train at Tanah Merah to continue to Tanjong Pagar and vice versa. This is really convenient for me. It is also close to China Town (just 10 minutes walk), and Maxwell Rd. Food Court (so I can get cheap dishes at anytime till midnight within a walking distance). The Tanjong Pagar area itself has a vibrant nightlife. The hotel is attached to the small shopping centre and there are some eateries (e.g. Burger King, Subway, etc.) so don't worry if you pay for the stay without breakfast. There is also a convenience store (Watson) to buy things like toilettries in case you forgot to bring it. Accross the lobby hotel, there is Tanjong Pagar Plaza, which has several cheap eateries and 24 HR internet cafe. On the other side of the street across from the rear of the hotel, there are 7-11 store and cafes. You will see the 7-11 store everytime you walk from Tj. Pagar MRT to the hotel anyway... :-) Restaurant For the earlier three stays, I paid the hotel without breakfast and nor I tried one of the eight restaurants at the hotel. As I mentioned previously, don't worry, there's a lot of eateries around the hotel. The last time I stay, I decided to pay including the breakfast. It's not bad, although not many of food variety. Taste is okay, but also not too excellent. It's decent for the business traveller. Facilities Nice swimming pool. Towels are provided, plenty of sunbeds. There is also a small 24hr gym, it is good to exercise after dinner. So all in all, I would recommend this hotel for those whose looking for decent 4-star hotel with no frills, good value but have a good facilities and excellent location.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for short comfortable stays\u201d", "Author": "MithunKr", "ReviewID": "UR87711000", "Content": "Unfortunately we got to stay in this great hotel just for a night.

Close to MRT, shopping and cheap dining. The hotel is in the same building as a shopping centre, making it very easy to buy take-away and other necessities. Across the street is a super-market, which we used to stock up on breakfast and drinks. There are several restaurants in the neighbourhood and at the hotel as well. Rooms: The hotel room has a good size. The 30 m2 they refer to on their webpage must be inclusive of the bathroom though. The bed is hard, but we slept very nicely in it. The pillows are great. The room is very silent \u2013 we couldn\u2019t hear any noise from the hallway, the other rooms or from the outside. Bathrooms: The bathroom has both a tub and a shower, which we liked. The pressure on the water was fine. The bathroom in it self looked at bit tired. It was kept clean everyday; however, the glasses was not replaced only washed and left for drying in the room. Business centre: A major down side! We found it hard to understand, why this would be a preferred business hotel. Internet in the room is really expensive 29 dollar pr. 24 hours! Printing in the business centre is even more ex-pensive, charging 2 SG-dollar pr. printed copy. As I had to print 40 pages for a conference, with print on both sides, that was 40x2x2 dollar \u2013 160 dollar for 40 prints!!! I complained to the manager and got a reduced price, yet still expensive, so printing at this hotel is not recommendable. Room service: We had room service a couple of times, prices were a bit high as one could expect, but noting extraordinary and the food was great! The minibar was very expensive and the items (usual coke, beer etc) was dusty and very dirty - it obviously hadn't been cleaned for some time. Laundry: There is a self-laundry on 8th floor where it is possible to wash and dry clothes. Though we didn\u2019t use it, I appreciated the opportunity. We primarily used the self-laundry for ironing. Staying with a toddler: We stayed with a toddler and he was giving lots of smiles and \u2018highfives\u2019 from the staff. We felt welcome and had no trouble. The hotel is however not designed for children, but you can get by without problems. The hotel supplied us with a portable cot, where our son slept \u2018like a baby\u2019 for the 10 days we stayed there. The hotel restaurants have high chairs as well. One thing that might cause a problem to other families with kids is that the television does not show any kids channels. In sum a fine hotel but nothing outstanding.

Our flight into Singapore arrived around 5:30PM, commuting from Changi Airport took us about 30 minutes to get to the hotel lobby, where the bell staff immediately took over our luggages. The front desk people however weren't really as accommodating, we were asking if lower priced rooms were available and if it's possible for us to transfer, the guy on the desk had several ways of answering us politely, but he chose to answer rather rudely that we already made arrangements with the travel agency and we are bound to pay it.

There are numerous restaurants in hotel but I ate at the many hawker centers (offering extraordinary value). However, the greatest attribute of the hotel is the staff which are professional, efficient, kind, and incredibly nice. In a city known for doing things quickly and well, the Amara staff excels--and I shall always stay at this hotel when I travel to Singapore. While there are more luxurious (and far more expensive) hotels in the City, the value for price of this hotel is extraordinary. Singapore is a great city to visit. I would recommend taking the Walking Tours that are offered--they are brilliant and thorough. The Singapore National Museum and the Asian Civilizations Museum are two musts. As stated, the hawker centers are places where you can eat a great meal for $6.00 to $8.00. There are, of course many good restaurants but I would urge you to avoid the many on the river in CBD--they are expensive and not very good.

Second, it was happening at around 2 o'clock in the morning. So, I had no choice. The fire alarm was ringing at 2 o'clock in the morning. When I got out, something is really wrong because the lift didn't work (as what happened during fire) and nobody at the reception answered my call (how stupid I am, that call made me to run back to my room and then being left by other people). So, I finally made to the emergency exit door. Through the stairs, from my 9th fl room to the 1st fl, nobody from the hotel assisted me. I had to run alone, with my socks on, in a very smelly and dirty stairs. Seemed that the hotel never pay attention to this area. When finally I reached the first fl and open the exit door. Still no hotel staf there. I had to run in the darkness by myself. And when I reached the lobby, some guests already there. Later I knew that they are from 8, 9, 15, and 17 fl. When I gathered with the others (around 10 guests), the hotel staffs explained simply that it was a false alarm and asked us to go back to our room. Just simple as that. Not even a sorry came from their mouth. How can we be sure that it was only a false alarm. Why he's so sure and make that statement only about 15-20 mins after the alarm?. Can't they checked it more comprehensively?. So, finally a guy from India suggested that we wrote something to the management about all of that and asked for further explanation. Well, this was a very bad experience for me. If this happened in my country, Indonesia, somehow I can accept that. We somewhat less developed compare to Singapore. Anyway...maybe I just put too much expectation. So, we'll see tomorrow, what will the management say about this matter. Hope this review helps.

No special character, but a pleasant and reasonably comfortable stay. Would have no problems staying here again if needed, but at this price range there are plenty of alternatives to choose from that will offer likely similar experiences. I will be trying another hotel next time in Singapore as there was nothing particular about this hotel that draws you back. Overall though, the stay was comfortable enough. SERVICE: Overall, no complaints. Our arrival at midnight was pleasant since there were no surprises - check-in was smooth and quick. The bell staff on hand was eager to suggest nearby late night eating options with us, which was helpful after 28 hours of airplane food. There weren't any other service points to speak of, as we didn't make any special requests or require any special attention, but overall the staff was polite, friendly, and made our stay comfortable. LOCATION: Not central (i.e., not located near Orchard Road) but very practically located nonetheless: 5 minute walk to the closest subway (MRT), as well as a 5 minute walk to the Maxwell Food Centre, which is an amazing experience for foodies (rows of outdoor stalls under one large compound roof) for varied, local, and cheap & delicious fare. We were able to get everywhere we wanted to go quickly via the extensive MRT routes, thus the placement is quite ideal while not being extremely busy right outside the hotel door. The hotel is quite close to Chinatown, however, so eating options abound within 10-15 minutes of walking. Approx 20 minute Taxi ride to the airport if arriving after 11:30 PM, otherwise, the MRT does stop right inside the airport for an extremely cheap alternative (although quite a bit lengthier - it took about 1 hour to get to the airport via this method.) HOTEL GROUNDS: The hotel itself is modern and classy enough for a business hotel. No complaints. The pool is beautiful and wonderfully relaxing - as close to a mid-city oasis that a standard business hotel pool can be. You will not find a nicer outdoor pool of this style at any similarly priced hotels in Singapore. The pool is large enough to do laps, as well as being a wonderul place to just relax. ROOMS & ACCOMODATION The room feels slightly on the smaller side, for two poeple. The space is functional, but not overly spacious. The bathroom, on the other hand, is spacious and beatifully laid in marble, and feels quite luxurious, with both marble shower and separate tub for bathing. The beds were average firm. CLEANLINESS: The room itself was clean and spotless, but the bathroom was dirtier than what you would expect from a business class hotel (example: we had to re-clean our toilet seat.) Bathroom amenities were replaced daily.

The plug got stuck in the bath on out second evening, while it was full. We informed reception of this at 5pm and, when we returned to our room at 3am we found it was still stuck, and full of dirty, cold bath water! We had also booked a taxi for the airport through the concierge the night before we left. We were informed it would be $x, which we kept aside in the currency. When it was 10 minutes overdue we started to panic, but no one seemed keen to chase it up. Then it transpired that it hadn't been booked at all. So they called another one, which turned out to be an executive airport car - we only knew this when we got to the airport (with very very little time to spare for our flight by now) and were charged twice as much as the Amara had quoted!

His advice on places to eat, where to get genuine electronics bargains, what was happening on any particular night really made our stay great.

On entering our room, there was a sticky substance on the floorboards under the curtains, and there was no price list for the minibar items which was very deceptive. 2. Housekeeping staff called our room to see when we wanted our room cleaned on the 29th Dec 2005. After a time was agreed upon, we were very upset when we returned at 11pm that night to see our room had not been attended to. 3. On the night of the 30th dec 2005 after asking a man at the reception desk could we have a newspaper delivered in the mornings, again we were disappointed that the next moring a newspaper was not delivered, and we had to ask again. Also on this day our room access card failed to work, and had to be corrected, and when our room was cleaned, no toilet paper was left. 4. Our biggest disappointment would have to be when we checked out early the morning of the 2nd January 2006. When we went to finalise our bill and were told we had to pay for 3 lots of breakfasts we had had during our stay. We were told on check-in that room and breakfast were included in the rate. We didn't think we chose the breakfast option, so both myself and my partner asked the woman at check-in again if this was correct and breakfast was included and she said yes. We were told at check-out that correspondence from our travel agent stating breakfast was NOT included had been recieved early november 2005 as dated by the Amara, but had not been looked at until 2-3 days into our stay late december. Even after the fax stating the correction was noticed by your staff we were not told about this and continued to have breakfast unaware. We would have expected a message stating the change from reception, or even been told at breakfast by the staff there. We found this to be either very poor communication and organisation within your hotel, or highly deceptive in getting more money out of tourists. We were then told by the manager at check-out he would only charge us for 2 of the breakfasts, and not the 3rd. We found this unacceptable, as we checked and checked again about the inclusion of breakfast, and were never informed of any change. Finally after refusing to pay the bill and some heated words we were told we wouldn't be charged then, but may be charged when someone more senior and responsble can make the decision. We found your hotel staff to be rude and disrespectful, with know acknowledgement from them that they had done anything wrong.
