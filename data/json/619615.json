What you don't get at the Hampton Majestic that you get at the Palmer House or Chicago Hilton is the extravagant lobby and other common areas.

My family and I could barely, and I mean barely, fit in the elevator with our bags (carry-on size) - it was a cozy ride to the top... I would certainly stay again despite the tiny elevators.

Continental breakfasts were pretty good too. They had a yummy western omelet and home fries. Rooms are really cute and look nicer than you would expect for a hampton inn. The hotel is in a great location, especially if you want to go to the theater (literally next door).

Although we checked in at around noon (which was nice of the hotel staff since we had a reservation for 3) we actually spent very little time at the hotel. First off: the hotel sign is pretty high up and the sign color almost matches the building color; this makes it hard to pick out while driving. There's a valet, which was 42 bucks for 24 hours with in/out privileges, and we took advantage of this. Millennium Garage is fairly close by but it's $29 for 24 hours and once you leave the garage you have to pay again. So take that into account when you make your decision. Staff was very friendly and accommodating; absolutely no issues there. The room itself was clean, spacious for the price, and comfortable. The bed was a bit uncomfortable for my wife but we're used to a different mattress. And she's pregnant, so it's probably a bit unfair to blame the bed too much in this case. There's free wi-fi in the hotel and breakfast was included (served until 10am); the hotel also has a fitness room but we didn't make it there so I couldn't tell you how good or bad it is. The hotel itself sits in the Theater District, which is apparently where people avoid having dinner or drinks past 9pm on a Saturday since 2 of the 3 restaurants we walked to were closed (we also noticed other restaurants with closing times of 9pm), so this is not a good place for nightlife. We did, however, walk a half a block or so to the Italian Village restaurant, which was very good (and open past 9pm). The 126 bus goes from Adams and State to Greektown (where we also went) and costs $2.25 and ~7 minutes of your time. Overall, it's a nice, well-kept hotel in a neighborhood with little nightlife; close to bus and metro stops and parking.

Both my husband and I had a back ache every night. The second issue we had with this hotel was the breakfast. It was lacking from the other years we stayed there. I don't know if there has been new management since last year but the breakfast was not good. It was all the frozen and thawed items that you get at other chain hotels but the Hampton usually has other items to off-set the standard items. The muffins and rolls were dried out and had no flavor. The waffle machine was broken. They did offer hot oatmeal for 2 of the days we were there but no brown sugar or raisins. I watched just about 15 guests ask the attendant if they had any of this and she looked at each one (including myself) like we were crazy for asking. They only had nuts to go with the oatmeal.

It's only a half block from the Blue Line train from O'Hare Airport and about 1 1/2 blocks from the Orange Line train from Midway Airport. The room was standard size with two comfortable queen beds, nice LCD TV (but I hate how this TV and most hotel TVs don't remember the last channel I was watching), good heating, bathroom that's perhaps 2 feet longer than most, good water pressure in the shower, and free WiFi. USA Today was delivered daily to my door. Since the carpet was dark, it was hard to tell how clean it was, but the beds and bathroom were clean. A refrigerator would have been nice. I really liked how there were only 9 rooms on my floor - very little walking distance from the elevator to any of the rooms. The 3 people at the front desk with whom I interacted were all very personable. Two computers (only one was working when I was there), printer (nice for boarding passes), and the breakfast area were right near the front desk. Breakfasts were filling and good, including (depending on the day) scrambled eggs or egg patty, sliced Polish sausage or link sausage, fruit salad (mostly orange, pineapple, and grapefruit), muffins, danish, cereals, and oatmeal. The danishes were a little dry and the egg patties were a bit hard, but everything else was good. Orange and passion fruit juices, milk, coffee, tea, and water are the drink options. I had the OJ, which was very good, except one day, when it was too dilute. There are many restaurant options nearby and there is a theatre right next door. In summary, I liked this hotel and its location.

It is a high rise hotel and we were on the 14th floor. There are only about 10 rooms on each floor. The building is tall and narrow and has a lot of historical charm. I enjoyed seeing the old fashioned mail chute. This is clearly an older building that has been transformed into a hotel. It is clean and has been updated to Hampton standards. Our room had very high ceilings and was right next to the fire escape, which I found interesting. Being downtown, there was some noise from traffic but not enough to be disturbing. The breakfast was the same as all Hampton Inns. The staff members maintained it very well. There is no pool in this hotel which could be an issue for some but did not bother us. The location is perfect, only a few blocks from the Magnificent Mile and the Theater District. The red line has a stop a half a block away which makes getting around town extremely quick and easy. You can buy passes for the red line at the Walgreens at the end of the block. We did all of our traveling by foot or on the red line or the bus, which are accessible from the same pass. Valet parking at the hotel is mandatory and pricey! We never used our own car but the valet men were very friendly. They always offered us advice on where to go and offered to make reservations or arrange transportation for us. Overall, this was a nice place to stay.

Sparkling bathroom every day. Clerks at the desk in the lobby were all friendly and eager to help. Check in and out fast and smooth. Lots of smiles! Great easy to follow directions for first time visitors to Chicago. Hot Breakfasts varied every morning. Each was wonderful and tasted freshly prepared. French toast sticks. Omelets. Sausage. Kielbasa. Scrambled Eggs. Bacon. Good variety of cut fresh fruit. The staff did a fantastic job keeping up with the demand on days that the breakfast crowd was big (never seemed to be out of anything but for a minute or so--even at the end of serving time at 10:00). Also, the usual variety of breads, coffee cake, waffles, cereals, yogurt, juice. Oh. A word about their coffee, available 24 hours. Wonderful! Delicious! RIch! Sorry, that was three words--but all deserved. Our hallway on the 20th floor was quiet. Only heard others twice when we were in the hall. Once our door was closed, we didn't hear anything...until the Thanksgiving Day Parade Thursday morning. We turned on the TV and watched the Macy's Parade in NYC with the volume off so we could enjoy the bands in the Chicago Parade! Perfect! Perfect first visit to Chicago. So convenient to get around using the trains which load within blocks of the hotel. And, what an amazing city to see!!!!! I booked directly through a clerk at the hotel, explaining it was our first time in Chicago and letting him know we put ourselves in his hands for a good room that had a view. We got a tremendous room with a high ceiling and the most amazing view!!!! The room rate was also a great experience--a real bargain for the theatre area.

Now back to the issue which I mentioned in the subject and it concerns the breakfast lounge (which is effectively the reception) : It is far too SMALL for such a big hotel and the arrangement is poor !! Too few tables and seats (talking about half a dozen table max.) and as soon as you're having 25 to people having their breakfast, you'll have to queue or stand up while eating. If you can't get hold of a seat, then you're left with the sofas which take up the remaining space and which are definitely not comfortable when you're taking a breakfast.

Checked with my friends on TripAdvisor and found the Majestic Mile Hampton that looked pretty good and was priced pretty reasonably... so I booked it. Upon arriving, W Monroe Street was under some crazy renovation... so watch the pot holes and exposed manhole covers. The valet guys are really confusing but kind of funny and nice. Expect to pay $42/night for valet (or parking anywhere in the city) with in and out priveledges. There are homeless people sleeping in the parking garage so they make you take out your electronics and sign a waiver... I guess it's expected anywhere in any major metro city. We were in a nice 2011 sports car and didn't have any problems so I wouldn't worry about it. Reception is on the 5th floor - Angel at the front desk is awesome... really nice! Checking is a breeze and we stayed on the 20th floor. Not much of a view since we faced an office building but I didn't really care. Room is neat with pumpkin orange walls with high ceilings (20 ft?). We had 2 double beds with a 40 inch Samsung flat screen TV. Did the bed bug test and didn't see anything. The mattresses actually looked pretty new but were a little too soft for my liking. Sheets were crisp and clean and unsoiled. Bathrooms are clean with a granite counter top and nice hot and powerful shower. No complains on the room... nothing fancy but super clean, comfortable, and nice. Fitness centre is 'meh'. It's free 24/7... 2 treadmills, 1 eliptical, a cable station, and balance ball. They all have TVs built in so bring your headphones or use theirs with 'supplied ear covers' that were out of stock when I was there. I think that's kind of nasty anyway... who wants to wear some sweaty old headphones? Dang... Ice is available on every floor and drink vending machines are on every 2nd floor. FREE BREAKFAST! A lot of free breakfasts are $#i+ but this one is decent. There are waffles, potatoes, bacon, english muffins, toast, cheese danishes, apple danishes, fresh fruit, apples, bananas, oranges, raisin bran, cheerios, another bran cereal, blueberry muffins, decaf, robust, regular coffee, and herbal teas. Also a juice dispencer with apple, orange, and a mango/guava juice (I think). A nice perk is that coffee, tea, and some fruit is available complimentary 24/7 in the lobby. I made some good use of it! There are also pre-bagged breakfasts at the front desk if you have to grab one to go. Two computers located in the lobby for internet access but I didn't use them since there is free WiFi. Overall, I'd totally recommend. Clean, safe, convenient... can't ask for more. To put the cherry on the sundae, it's right downtown. You can walk to food, the Skydeck, Willis tower, and many of the other attractions. And if you like shopping, you can get to State street where shopping starts. There is a Forever 21 right on the corner followed by a T-Mobile, huge Macy's, Cartier, Disney Store, Puma.... Chicago is a great city that everyone should see. It's layed out nicely with FANTASTIC architecture and such a great character to it. The stuffed deep dish pizza is a must.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an easy walk to Millennium Park, Art Institute, Architecture Foundation tours, restaurants, shops, public transportation (Orange train from Midway took us right there). Well situated for viewing many important buildings and public art. Crossing the river to N. Michigan Ave. is only about a 15-minute walk. Since we were in Chicago to see the sights, this was most important to us. The hotel consists of the upper floors of the Majestic Theater (now Bank of America Theater). Our room, 802, was a good size, with one king bed, desk, dresser and flat TV. No refrigerator. Decor in both the bedroom and bathroom was dark. Housekeeping did an excellent job, and it always felt clean. In fact, while we were there the carpets were professionally cleaned, which is nice, but it meant walking around on squishy wet carpet one evening and inhaling cleaning fluid. The free buffet breakfast is standard fare, but was a big savings and allowed for a quick start out the door each day. I must commend Crystal, an outstanding employee who keeps the buffet freshly stocked and goes out of her way to accommodate any special requests. One word of warning - unless you get there around the time it opens (6am) you will be jostling with a crowd of guests crazed by the sight of free food. Free wireless internet is also a big plus, since fancier, more expensive hotels usually gouge you for this. There are also two computers in the lobby that are free to use, especially handy for checking in with the airlines. For security reasons, you need a room key to get to your floor but not to the lobby, which is fine, but because the hotel starts on the 4th floor, everyone found it challenging to get the hang of it. Abdoul, a downstairs bellman, was terrific in storing and retrieving our luggage after we checked out, and saw to it that our cab was waiting for us on time. Employees like this, who take pride in their work and go about it with a positive attitude truly make traveling a pleasure. We were disappointed that the hotel was unable to fulfill our request for a room on a high floor with a view. Since we were staying for five nights with the expressed purpose of studying Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s architecture, it would have meant a lot to us, plus, the upper floors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be full. I say this because the vending machines on our floor were sold out every evening, despite my reporting it to housekeeping, and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until I made my way to the 17th floor that I found a working machine. This happened every single evening. Overall, the price was competitive for decent downtown accommodations, the bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, and the hotel served as a good home base.

Yes, perhaps for some, the dark color of the rooms interior is not adequate for any reason, but for me it was perfect, it shows a distinctive touch to the whole hotel design but also provided me with fantastic sleep and general feeling of coziness. Have I mentioned that it's very clean? There were some disadvantages though. Breakfast is included, however the breakfast area is very small and you can hardly find a place to sit. Breakfast itself was very ordinary, but the biggest minus from me is that they are using exclusively plastic cutlery and cups, not only in the breakfast area, but throughout the whole hotel. Since it was the earth day at the time, the plastic/foam didn't look very well at all. Parking: can be a big hassle. If you don't have a car it's probably perfect location, but with a car try to get the rate with parking included. It's a valet parking.

Some Hamptons do offer coin laundry for guests; this one did not but I thought that gesture was extremely accommodating and not something your average hotel would suggest...more props to Hampton for going above and beyond.

The bathroom was good with plenty of space around the sink for toiletries. The breakfast was okay, it is included in everyones room rate.

We loved our trip to Chicago it was even better than expected. The museums such as The Field & Art Institute are very good. Chicago is an excellent destinations for families as there are many interactive attractions for the kids. We will certainly be back as there is still more to see.

The food was hot and plentiful. There was also a selection of fruits, as well as the obligatory pastry/toasts selection. Coffee, tea, cocoa, and juices at the ready. Three blocks from Millennium Park, a couple of blocks from the Chicago River -- ideally situated.

Fourth, perfect location. Safe, quiet but access to everything. Some people in the reviews were moaning and groaning b/c the community areas are small and the decor has dark colors and the rooms don't have enough lights. What a bunch of babies - who wants to hang out in the community areas? Get out in the city or relax in your home. Yes, the breakfast area gets crowded but that is small price to pay. As for the decor, our room was brown and orange, personally I loved the colors. It was NOT gothic as others said. It had a nice, clean look to it overall. PLENTY of lamps to light up the whole room. Are you performing surgery in your room? No? Then I think the light provided will suffice! If I had to complain about anything it would be the price of the valet service - $42 per night at the time of this review BUT you get free in/out privileges, which none of the other garages allowed which we liked b/c it was soooo cold this time of year. So it worked for us but if you are only taking the car out 1 x per day there are garages up the street for about $15 less per night. We would definitely go back in a heart beat.

The Adams/Wabash metro station is 1.5 blocks away ($2.25 fare from Midway takes about 20-25 min). The hotel has been recently renovated and was very clean. Lobby is small but offers a business center with two internet PC's and printer free of charge for hotel guests. A large breakfast is served in the lobby including cereals, breads, eggs, bacon/sausage, home made waffles and beverages. The rooms are large and well appointed for a business class hotel. Design is contemporary and bathroom includes granite/marble appointments, premium bath products and an excellent shower. The room also includes a large LCD television. The only downside is that the room was a little dark and could have used more lightening. I was able to shop around and secure a rate of $92/night for two queens. Having stayed in Chicago many times, I will definitely be back to this hotel. It's a great value and the Loop location means it's not directly in the Mag Mile hustle but still close enough for that Chicago experience.

You are welcomed by a small but friendly and efficent lobby area. The staff are very efficient and extremely friendly and always available to give help and assistance when needed. The lobby also contains a breakfast area where complimentary breakfasts are served every morining with a fair selection of hot and cold food.

High-speed internet access is available throughout the hotel free of charge via wi-fi or ethernet cable. Our room was on the 11th floor and situated at the rear of the hotel away from the main street. There was minimal street noise with only the occasional siren from emergency services vehicles; this meant that we were able to get a good nights sleep. The room was adequately sized with a king-sized bed, work-desk, easy chair, computer chair, chest of drawers and built-in wardrobe. Also provided was a 32\" HD flat-screen tv with a host of channels including a fair number of HD channels. The bathroom was very good and contained all modern conveniencies and plenty of towels. Also situated in the bathroom was the coffee maker with plenty of sachets. The bed was extremely comfortable, especially after a hard day walking around the city! The only gripe we had was that on a couple of occasions we found that the room-maid still hadn't made up the room by late afternoon; a little inconvenient if you were wanting to take a shower etc before dinner! Never-the-less the service was first class! On one particular day it had been raining during the morning and we didn't have an umbrella; we noticed another guest had been given a complimentary umbrella for the rest of his visit. So, we asked for one too and was handed one for our stay. Needless to say it never rained again for the rest of our stay!! The hotel is situated on W.

My wife liked the hotel because of the overall cleanliness. During the stay, she and my son did not get stuffy nose. In most hotels we have stayed at, the HVAC systems usually got the nose of her or my son stuffy. But not at this hotel. The room was large for 3 people. Our room had two queen sized beds, which were huge and comfortable. The beds were not hard and not too soft. The comforters and pillows were clean and comfortable. The room had a huge flat screen LCD TV with the usual channels. The one complaint I had was that the housekeeping maid did not leave us with enough hand towels, any cups and any spare roll of toilet paper in the second day. I called the front desk to lodge a complaint. The manager, Andrew, called me back and took care of the problems with a sincere apology. I was impressed with how well the management handled my complaint. A minor concern I had was the huge, old, wood-framed windows, which did not offer good sound insulation. As a result, I could hear honking noises made by cars at night (our room was on the 10th floor). The honking noises were not too loud, but noticeable. Luckily the honking noises did not prevent my family from falling asleep. Other than the faint honking noises, I could hear water running when our next door neighbors took their shower. But that kind of shower noises from the rooms next door is a common thing in many hotels that I have stayed at, and is not a problem unique to this hotel. However, I was impressed by the fact that I did not hear any noise through the walls from the rooms on both sides of our room indicating that the walls did a very good job in noise insulation. In addition, I did not hear any noises from the hallway during my stay. I think the fact that there were only 8 rooms per floor reduced the number of people staying on each floor and as a result reducing the chance of hallway noises. The room had a pair of thick, burgundy curtains at the windows, which curtains did a very good job in keeping the room dark in the morning. The free buffet breakfast was quite well stocked with a hot meat item and an egg item every morning. The breakfast dining room was, unfortunately, kind of tight so it was crowded every morning. Nevertheless, on the overall, I am very happy with the hotel stay here. Finally, the location of the hotel is great: less than a block from the Red Line or Green Line, only about 3 blocks from Millenium Park and about 8 blocks from the Chicago River.

However, if you're looking for an extremely clean room in a nice building, with great service from the minute you walk into the place, perfectly situated between the red and blue lines, and at a great price compared to other area hotels, with a pretty good free breakfast, then stay here. If you plan on seeing Jersey Boys (which I highly recommend) then staying here is an added bonus for convenience. I just returned from a five night stay there and could not have been more pleased with the Hampton Majestic. I chose this hotel partly because I did want to see Jersey Boys a few times, partly because of the reviews, largely for proximity to subway access and largely for the great rate I got (average of $109 per over the five nights). The front desk people were great. Of note when I checked out at 1:30 in the morning to catch an early flight, the girl at the front desk (on 5/26) actually went and got the keys to turn on the juice machine in the breakfast area just so I could have a glass of juice before I left. Small thing but incredibly thoughtful. There's no restaurant other than the very good breakfast buffet, but no problem. There's more than you need just outside the hotel (my favorite was Italian Village). The rooms were average size, nice size bathrooms, both very nice and clean. Free in-room internet service and computers and printer for use in the lobby helped too; and a nice big flat screen tv in the room. There's a fair amount of street traffic noise below, expected though for an area like that, but seems to die down by 10:00 pm or so. More importantly, it was very quiet inside the hotel, and I noticed security making rounds at night, plus a card key required to use the elevator at any time and to enter the building after 10 or 11 PM. Would like to have seen an actual safe in the room, but otherwise felt very safe. Being so close to the blue and red lines make it a straight shot to/from O'Hare on the blue (much quicker and cheaper than a taxi) and to Wrigley Field and White Sox Park on the red. Easy walk to Lake M. too. This would have been a bargain at twice the price I paid.

Even better, we were able to find an online room rate of $139 for the Homewood Suites, which is a great price for that hotel... but in the end, with very little to go on in deciding between the two, my husband and I selected the Hampton Inn Majestic for two reasons... one, because it really was the best situated hotel for the business we had to do in town... and two, because the Homewood Stay Suites reviews all (or mostly) seemed to be from families traveling with children. I don't dislike kids, but I have had too many experiences when traveling of kids not being well-supervised in hotels by parents who understandably want to relax and enjoy their own well-deserved vacations.... and regretably for other travelers in hotels, this often means having children pounding up and down hotel hallways outside your door at all hours, yelling and chasing each other early in the morning... slamming in and out of rooms with loud, self-closing doors repeatedly.... handling food at breakfast buffets without washing hands, etc. I have seen NO indications in reviews for the Homewood Suites that this is the case or the norm at that hotel! But I couldn't find any reviews from people who weren't themselves traveling with children, so I wasn't sure I was seeing reviews from travelers with my own perspective. So, regretfully, we passed on Homewood Suites and reserved with Hampton Inn Majestic. I searched and searched, but could not find a rate less than $199 a night for the time we'd be there... my husband and I are not \"luxury hotel\" people, and prefer not to blow more than $100 a night of vacation budgets on lodging...but in the end decided that the location and the good reviews might justify the expense. We were not disappointed. I realize that every hotel review is subjective, and that everyone's personal experience is dictated by a number of unpredictable factors... but all I can do is tell you what we experienced. We were given a room on the 8th floor. Elevator access to room floors is controlled by your room key, which is a nice added security measure in downtown Chicago. Our room was a good size. Walls are a darkish rust color, which made for a darker room than I generally like, but color doesn't matter that much to me. The most important thing to me in ANY hotel room is whether or not the bed is comfortable. These beds were terrific. Not too soft, not too hard; didn't wake up with aching backs. The second most important thing to me in a hotel room is room temperature. The thermostat in our room was easy to understand, immediately responsive, and let you set a specific temperature and maintain it automatically rather than force you to rely on vague \"warmer/cooler\" dials that required you to constantly adjust a dial up or down. The third most important thing to me in a hotel room is quiet. Our room was wonderfully quiet for all four nights of our stay. We didn't hear doors slamming in the morning, or plumbing from other rooms. We didn't hear other people's TVs, or hair dryers, or conversations. We didn't hear conversations out in the hallway. I'm pretty sure there were at least three other people staying on our floor, because newspapers would be outside those doors in the mornings... either we lucked out and stayed on a floor with some very courteous fellow travelers, or these rooms are just well sound-proofed. The shower heads are very high... my 6-foot-tall husband was thrilled not to have to crouch to wash his hair. I'm a bit shorter, and had to adjust the shower spray to ensure that there'd still be some force to the water by the time it hit my reduced height. :-) The included breakfast was okay, not spectacular... but it did include hot items (scrambled egg discs and ham discs) as well as breads and a variety of cereals, juices, milk, etc. I would have liked to have waffles as an option. The business center was TERRIFIC. I was able to check email and print boarding passes, as one would expect, but ALSO to download and print some Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF documents, which is not always possible in a hotel business center. There are lots of dining options within walking or easy train ride distance. We ate at the Grillroom across the street (WONDERFUL flourless chocolate cake there!!!), at Petterino's within walking distance of the Ford Theatre, and at the Weber Grille (an easy ride on the red line). All were great. The Hampton Inn Majestic staff, though we had limited interaction with them, were very friendly and helpful throughout. We regretfully decided to check out a night early because our flight home was going to be very early in the morning, and the train's Blue Line was going to be undergoing repairs over the weekend that would force us to take the train part of the way, then take a shuttle, then get back on the train... and we couldn't face the uncertainty and possible delays on the morning of an early flight. We decided to spend the last night in the Chicago Hilton at O'Hare, and did not have nearly as wonderful an experience there as we did at this Hampton Inn (which, I believe, is also a Hilton property?). I have also posted a review about our experience at that hotel, if you're interested. In summary, if this hotel is as well-located for you as it was for us, you can't go wrong. Sure wish it were cheaper... but it's not outrageous for a hotel in downtown Chicago, and you definitely get good hotel value for the money.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT STAFF AND LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "Luv2travel83virginia", "ReviewID": "UR29942448", "Content": "The staff was excellent!!

Arrived home in the early hours of this morning and even though jet lagged wanted to get this review on here asap!! We couldn't of asked to be in a better location. Arrived at O'Hare no problems at all and as recommended on TA we braved the 'L'. So glad we did - we did not stop using it. We arrived at T5 and signposts to the train station were good - we then brought a 7 day CTA pass for the 'L' (inc use of CTA buses too) for $26 each (they also do 1 and 3 day passes). We found this to be great value for money as the cost of our two passes, which we used all week would have been about the price of a taxi one way!! Can't recommend it enough as the subway locations for the blue and red line are both just around the corner from the hotel so no problem at all. They seemed to be very reliable too and very frequent! It was useful as we could walk all the way some where and know we could hop on the 'L' to get back to the hotel! Also useful if you want to take in a Sox (or Cubs) game as the L takes you straight there. I'm not a big sports fan but the baseball is so much fun to watch and very entertaining - definitely recommend it. We saw the White Sox play and got tickets on the day (I believe the cubs tickets are a lot harder to come by!!) The hotel itself is in a lovely building, rooms were of a good size and clean, staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a high floor room (18th) and we were not bothered by any street or other guest noise (apart from the odd slamming door!!) The breakfast included was fine for what it was - buffet style - you could fill up on fruit, toasts, bagels, juice, cakes and there was also a small hot option. Coffee was availble all day in the lobby which was most welcome after a day of sightseeing!! As for Chicago itself we did all the usual tourist things but have to say the highlights for us (apart from the fantastic shopping!) was the Chicago Trolley tour - great to get your bearings, Sears Tower, drinks at night for the view at the top of the Hancock Tower and the Shedd Aquarium (you have to see the 4D Planet Earth show!!!). Food was great and we had a particularly good dinner at The Gage opposite the Millenium Park and only a short walk from the Hotel. Millenium Park is great to stroll around and we thought the Bean was amazing - so many photo opportunities!! Almost forgot our other highlight was bumping into Jerry Springer walking around Chicago! My only regret.....we did not take advantage of seeing the Jersey Boys in the theatre next to the Hotel!", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Indiana", "Title": "\u201cAlmost perfect...one major problem.\u201d", "Author": "ladystarblade", "ReviewID": "UR29603303", "Content": "Not wanting to attempt driving/parking in downtown Chicago, my two friends and I booked at the Majestic while we were in town for a girls' weekend. The location is very nice...just a few blocks from the Art Institute, though it's about a mile and change hike to the Museums and the Lake. The lobby's on the 4th floor...the hotel doesn't even 'start' until the 4th floor, so that took some getting used to. The staff was fantastic, the rooms were spacious and scrumptious, and the price + valet parking, while still pricey, was FAR better than any other downtown Chicago hotel. So, what was the major problem? We arrived early, about 1030am, in town, stopping for lunch before we went to the hotel. We got to the hotel a little before 2pm and were told that the room wasn't ready yet...okay. 3pm's check-in time, no biggie. We checked our luggage with the wonderful valet staff (though they had to even tag our pillows!), and set out to wander the town a little. We wound up hiking out to the Museum Campus and back. Upon returning, we figured we'd go and drop things off in the room, then go to dinner. But the room still wasn't ready and our luggage was still down in the valet station. It was 530pm. We were a bit travel-weary and a bit footsore, and we wound up sitting in the lobby for another half-hour while the room was finished. The desk clerk explained that they had a 'full turnover', as in, everyone had checked out that morning and every room had to be cleaned, but still, having to wait 3 full hours past our check-in time irked us, especially in our tired and hungry conditions. Then, once we were checked in, we were not allowed to bring our own luggage up; we had to wait for the bellhop. After a 25min wait (after being told it would only be 5-10min), we had to call the front desk to remind them to send it up. As a result, we didn't get out of the hotel until well past intended time and were faced with the hordes of Saturday night diners swarming Chicago. If not for that, this would have been a perfect experience and we would stay here again, but I suggest that if the housekeeping staff is that overextended, perhaps they should hire on another person or two. Just a suggestion.

We went there primarily to see the Broadway Musical \"Jersey Boys\" and decided to get reservations at the Hampton Inn Majestic which was adjacent to the theater. We didn't even have to step outside (in the cold rain and wind) to enter the theater, because there was an entrance from inside the hotel. How convenient! The hotel itself was nice, although I've stayed in much nicer for less money. But, the room was very clean and the beds were comfy and we were only in our room long enough to sleep; we spent most of each day taking advantage of all this great city had to offer! We were all VERY IMPRESSED by the friendly, accomodating staff. From the moment we stepped into the hotel and was met by our very gracious doorman to the young women overseeing the continental breakfast each morning, we were made to feel like royalty! They genuinely seemed interested in making our stay as pleasant as possible. Also, the continental breakfast was one of the best I've ever seen. A nice selection of hot food and pastry items, as well as cereals and fruit. There were about 4 or 5 juice choices as well as 3 choices in coffee and hot water available for hot cocoa. Also, the food was replenished as needed and if you came down 15 minutes before the end of the allotted time for breakfast, there would still be plenty of food available. So, when you consider the great breakfast and the great service, I had no problem with the price of the room which was around $140 per night. The lobby was comfortable, with a couple of couches, chairs and several tables (seating 4-6 people). They also had a small business center with a couple of complimentary computers and free internet. There was an exercise room, but we didn't take the time to check it out. I thought the location of the hotel was just perfect. We were able to walk to the Art Institute, the Park, the fabulous shopping, great restaurants and managed quite well. I have a mild disability, but was able to tolerate the walking without much of a problem. It is so easy to hail a cab whenever you need one. I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn Majestic to anyone visiting Chicago to go to the theater or to take advantage of the fabulous shopping. We got a cab from Midway Airport to the Hamton Inn Majestic and it cost about $25 (not counting the tip), which was split between the four of us. I can't imagine anyone not liking this hotel and its' location!

I recommend the Tall Ship ride on 'Windy' based at The Navy Pier, 'The Untouchables' gangster theme trip was real fun!! See 'The Jersey Boys' not far to go as you are right there!! What a great show indeed plus 'The Turn of the Century' at the Goodman theatre ony 5 mins walk away Take a leisurely stroll along the lake to the Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium. GO TO CHICAGO and have a wondeful time so much to see and do - lovely parks and trees throughout this vibrant city. HAVE FUN HERE!

Bellman are exceptional. 3. Location to several \"El\" lines are within blocks - some even closer. Both lines that get you to/from either airport are also within walking distance, luggage and all. Completely doable - look for the elevator entrances to make it easier. 4. Continental breakfast is decent for a quick start to the day. About what you expect - cereals, toast, muffins, juice, some hot choices etc. - remember the city always has plenty of local choices for a real breakfast, still this does just fine - fresh, clean, carbo loaded to get you going. 5.

A bellman is always present on the ground level to see you in. The staff was excellent and we never had any problems with the facilities or our room. The rooms are of good size and decorated in dark theatre colors. The building is older, but was refurbished and is really a unique place to stay. We never had any noise problems with our neighbors or \"city\" noise-possibly because we were well above it (16th floor). An extra added bonus is that breakfast is provided every day. While not a 5-star meal, it was definitely adequate and got us started with our day nicely. A definite money-saver if staying with a family. Pubic transportation is extremely easy to use in Chicago and the Hampton is located within 1/2 block of the \"Red\" line of the El, which will give you access to just about anywhere in the city. The Metra is also within walking distance. We were able to walk to the Sears tower, Millennium Park, the waterfront, and all along Michigan Avenue. We often walked so far, that it just became easier to take the \"El\" back to our hotel as the station was so close (State/Monroe station). We'd stay here again if just for convenience alone.
