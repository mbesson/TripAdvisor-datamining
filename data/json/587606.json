The only problem was the noise outside, however I have stayed in many inner city hotels and it can be difficult to find a quiet hotel room. I would certainly return to this hotel, the room had tea/coffee maker, TV, phone and all toiletries were supplied.

The reception area is basic and all the staff we encounteres were helpful, we arrived early but couldn't check in but we were able to lock our luggage away and come back at 2pm. The room was small but functional. It was modern, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean - in fact it had been cleaned a little too much (the smell of bleach was a litle over bearing). There was a decent sized wardrobe with a safe and mini fridge which was unexpected. The hotel was in a quietr location and we heard no noise at all meaning we had a peaceful night sleep. Breakfast was a simple continental buffet but there was adequate food available and considering the price we paid it was very reasonable. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel.

The hotel is very clean and modern and although the rooms are a little on the small side just how much room does a person need to sleep? The idea is to spend your time exploring London not sitting in your bedroom so I do not agree with the negative comments left previously. We were on the top floor at the back of the hotel and had a very quiet and peaceful night. The bathroom was superbly decked out in marble and chrome with a hot and powerful shower. The breakfast which was included was another plus point for the hotel. Service was quick, polite and the selection was plentiful. For the price we paid the location was fantastic! We were very close to the West End and within walking distance of Oxford Street. I simply cannot fault this hotel at all and feel the value for money received was exceptional. We would defiantly stay here in future and have already recommended the hotel to many friends.", "Date": "April 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall", "Title": "\u201cThe tiniest hotel in the whole wide world... with so many half measures.\u201d", "Author": "oliver_jeffery", "ReviewID": "UR7276402", "Content": "Hotel 82 is a case of bizarre half measures. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lift, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so small it can fit two able bodied people in at a crush - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way a wheelchair could fit in.

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cool LCD telly in the bedroom (nice) which only shows terrestrial and around 15 indecipherable foreign channels (kind of pointless\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). The bedroom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean and nicely decorated, but so small that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get out if the bathroom door is open - see the picture. The room is so small in fact, that when bending down to get something out of the cupboard, I cut my back on the desk to the right of the bed. Painful, annoying, and a perfect example of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong with this hotel.

I was allowed to very quickly have a show in another room that was booked but the person had not arrived yet, I was asked to be quick! The room was ok, no Internet access though. The bed was itchy! Every now and then it was anoying, but not all the time. I don't know if it was bed bugs or just bad washing powder (may it was because everyone else mentioned it). The next morning, just after I checked out, the same girl on the front desk mentioned that she stayed in the room next to mine and that the shower was working fine.

It looked nice on the website but after reading TA reviews I was a bit worried. But it was actually OK. When we checked in the receptionist did ask if she could copy all of our personal id but we refused and she just said that the mangement said she had to ask and left it at that. Having said that she did have details of our company credit card so we were fairly low risk. The rooms were all small but lovely - very clean, very modern, very nice en suites and very comfy beds. Not a lot of space but that wasn't a problem. I didn't like not having tea and coffee facilities in the room especially as buying a cup of tea cost \u00c2\u00a32. There is a coffee bar round the corner from the hotel tho if you don't mind going out which is better. We arrived back very late and the staff (and their friends?) were on reception and in the very tiny bar. They were friendly but very noisy which made it hard to hold a conversation in the bar altho once we went to our rooms we couldnt hear them thankfully. Breakfast is in a tiny but nice dining room in the basement. The selection is limited - nothing cooked - but what is there is OK.
