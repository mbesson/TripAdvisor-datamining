Why allow casually dressed people into a 5 star hotel if you cannot treat them like 5 star guests?! After waiting for the 2 receptionists to get off the phone we finally got our room. On entering the whole room smelled greasy due to the huge pile of takeaway rubbish under the desk (see photo). I found a member of housekeeping who cleared the mess and apologized profusely. Fair enough. It got worse. The minibar looked like somebody had take a crowbar to it! There was a long line of sharp tacks sticking out, there were also items of food in the air conditioning vent! If all this was not bad enough our room was entered twice and serviced even though the \"do not disturb\" sign was on the door. On the second occasion our clothes which were laid on the bed for us to change into after we returned from lunch were moved and the bed made. We were late to the Hyper Japan exhibition where we were representing our company. The worst part of all this is the complaint. I wrote an email telling the hotel about all of this. They contacted me back and told me that the room was NOT dirty, the room was NOT serviced when we said it was, there is nothing wrong with the minibar and there was no food in the air conditioning. Even with the photographic evidence and another person to verify my story they told me I am lying. or to be exact: \"Our reports, door lock readings and cctv footage are at variance with your comments and completely contradictory. I can see no benefit to you or us in detailing each of these at this juncture\" This is the reply from Mary Doogan Group General Manager Grange Hotels So,...I would advise anybody considering staying at this hotel not to. There is a travelodge a few minutes away at a fraction of the price and with half of the expectations! (at least you know where you stand with travelodge). For something more upmarket try the tower hotel by Guoman (owners of the cumberland in Marble Arch) which overlooks the river and is 4 star but a whole lot better than this. This is NOT a 5 star hotel. It does not offer the service standards, politeness or cleanliness you expect at this level and to tell a complaining guest that they and their partner are lying is just appalling at this level. I am taking my complaint to both trading standards and the tourist board. I have also moved all business trips to another chain and urge anybody reading this to look elsewhere for accommodation at tower bridge. P.S. All photos were taken on the day of arrival, the 3 blurry looking ones are of the food in the air conditioning unit, looks like somebody couldn't stomach their breakfast!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kettering, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c5* if you think travel lodge is as good as it gets.\u201d", "Author": "Jamie J", "ReviewID": "UR125953308", "Content": "Firstly can I state that I approach this review with experience as a hotel manager and also of the sometimes unreasonable expectations of the guest. Also, my two night stay was purchased as part of the 'lastminute' franchise and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a discount experience. On entering the hotel my partner and I where rudely asked by the doorman if we were 'looking for the right hotel', now although slightly frayed from travel neither of us is tree hugging hippies nor tracksuit wearing whatever the phrase would politely be. We are both professionals and at no point do I expect to be spoken down to by a doorman when in relaxed albeit smart denim and shirt mode; simply this is plain rude. This disdainful attitude was continued at the reception desk and was nothing more than unwelcoming. On entering our room, we encountered a small room that was not overly clean (sticky headboard -I dread to ask) on the ninth floor overlooking the railway track. The view I could live with, but the room was one of the worst I've ever encountered (I have stayed in cleaner more spacious 2* accommodation in Italy, that as someone of Italian descent I expect the bare minimum from). In fairness to the hotel I complained to the reception and they changed our room to one on the sixth floor overlooking the old city wall that was far nicer. However, the room still did not match up to my experience of even four star accommodation and the loitering member of staff who clearly wanted a tip for the hotels bad service was plainly painful to watch (recall that awful scene in home alone 2 that we all thought was a joke?). Finally, my last gripe with this hotel is the insalubrious bar, frequented by the very worst type of coked-up businessmen who believe their own hype. It was a horrid atmosphere and a most unwelcome one to have unsuspectingly taken my partner to after a lovely evening out in the city. These type of patrons can be encouraged to act like gentleman by the staff and the best way to start is to employ female staff as well as male and to actively discourage the type of customer whose experience of women is escorts (simply fella's if you want a nice weekend with your wife DO NOT end it in the Isis bar).

The room was quite nice although there was a problem with the air con which took six phone calls and 3 hours before the staff bothered to do anything. The Hotel is 1 minute from Tower Hill Tube and is near the City and Tower Bridge so is in good location. The only problem is that 95% of the bars in the vicinity are only open Mon- Friday. Surprisingly Saturday nights in that area are dire. So you have to travel further a field on a Saturday. The on site gym and swimming pool are very good and well equipped. The bar in the hotel did not have friendly staff and the service was appalling. Also I tried the room service and paid \u00c2\u00a314 for the worst Pizza I have ever had, why it was so bad is beyond me but you can get frozen pizza's in the supermarket for a couple of quid which are ten times better.

After 45 minutes of watching other people check in we went back to reception explaining that we had tickets for wine tasting and the theatre that we would be late for if we waited any longer for the room. The receptionist apologised (this was probably the 3rd time we had returned to the desk asking when the room would be available). During check in the receptionist actually discussed that we had a \"package\" in the room, I gave her good eye contact in which she suddenly realised that this was suppose to be a secret. Luckily my partner didn't hear but I still thought this was quite poor and a bit tackless. When we eventually got the key to our room we had to literally dump our bags and go which gave us no time to enjoy the extras. However the hotel did provide an ice bucket and ice for us to enjoy the champagne later. On the second day we stayed our key was also locked and stopped working in the morning which we had to see reception about. This was cleared up very quickly but an inconvenience we could have done without. Overall the hotel was lovely but out of choice I'd definately choose to stay at the St Paul's Hotel.

I also recently stayed in the 5 star Corinthia hotel, so was expecting pretty much the same standard - how wrong was I! The hotel is quite dated and has tired furniture. Our room was pleasant enough - we got upgraded to an executive room which had a view of the Tower of London, albeit an obscured one due to the office block next door. The room was large, as was the bed. However the furnishings were very old - the telephones looked like they were bought in 1985, and the overall decor of the room was not very modern. I didn't mind this too much as sometimes the most modern rooms arent necessarily the best. The spa was quite nice, a Roman theme with a large pool great for swimming and small-ish steam/sauna rooms etc. I had a massage which was passable, although the masseuse was very friendly. Our package included dinner in the restaurant. I know we went in Jan 2012 but this huge restaurant was absolutely deserted. The food was nice, but the service was terrible. Upon arrival we were asked if we wanted a bottle of water, yes we said - and 30mins later we were still waiting for it, gasping of thirst. Our bottle of wine after 40mins, and the starters about 50mins. Nearly an hour to wait for your wine and starter - not good. The breakfast was passable, again, nothing 5* about this for me. It was bog standard English breakfast made from bog standard quality food. I was still eating and had put my knife and fork down on my plate (apart), when a waiter proceeded to swipe it from underneath me! I had to explain I was still eating - this is simple table etiquette - you would think a waiter in a 5* hotel would understand a guest has not finished if her cutlery is sitting apart on her plate. Again - I kept comparing this with previous hotels. It just seems that the staff here do not have a clue. Our package included a late checkout of 2pm. At midday I got a call from reception asking whether we would check out, I explained we had the room until 2pm and they apologised. We went down to the spa for a final swim etc, upon arrival back to the room, we found to our horror the keys had been de-activated and we were left stranded in our wet robes in the corridor. We had to hunt around the floor for a chambermaid to let us in. Very annoying! I feel that this hotel may have been a 5* years ago, but it most certainly is not now. It has all the makings that it could be 5*, but years of neglect, and hiring staff who quite simply do not understand what service is required have made this a very disappointing hotel.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cBe VERY careful booking this hotel\u201d", "Author": "auditt225", "ReviewID": "UR122396301", "Content": "I booked a two night stay at this hotel through Lastminute.com for New Years.

It creaked every time you moved, had a very thin mattress (about 15cm) and even the thin mattress was totally 'shot'. We just couldn't believe how bad it was (not even 2*). Then we realised why they had sold us a 'syndicate' room where the bed folds back into the wall - it was a put you up bed! At a 5* price unbelievble! The room/bed were described as 'superior double' - more like very inferior.... The Guest relations Lady was very good but lied \"Oh I will have to get housekeeping to look at that we have NEVER had complaints about that room before...\" Really???? They moved us to room 632 which was fine for a 4* room with a nice view of the Tower and the top of Tower Bridge.

Reception - helpful, efficient. We were checking in on a sunday afternoon and it was not that busy. Room - amazing view of tower bridge and the thames (ask for a room with a view). The room isnt huge and neither is the bathroom, and the door swings shut all the time which is extremely annoying. All usual mod cons, tv player, bose radio, tea/cofee facilities. The decor is quite depressing, all dark colours and dark wood. Food - expensive (in main restaurants). We ate in the bar which was nice and relaxed and the fajitas were amazing! We also had breakfast here which was cheaper and you get to watch the world go past the window. Spa - Nice pool, steam room much too hot and very bright, no atmosphere. Facial was nice, but felt very much like a production line, no time taken to explore what i wanted etc. The lady came in and said, ok so you relax now (like i could just do it on demand)... No candles, and she kept squeezing past my bed to get to the water tap to rinse her sponges. Thorough facial but was not relaxing and felt quite impersonal. Overall - nice hotel.

We've always been allocated nice rooms so I believe it is fair to say that all rooms are nice and spacious. I have seen the review about the wall facing room - we have stayed in one of those rooms before, but I think ours was on a slightly higher floor and the wall is more of an original feature rather than the contrary. We have never dined in the evening. This hotel is extremely convenient, an easy 2 minute walk from the tube station and 5 minutes walk to tower bridge. It is not on main road, more of an access road so it is one of the quietest hotels I know in London.

I did so this week while visiting form the Middle East, where I now live. I was disappointed - it is aging and whilst this may have a certain rustic charm, the overall impression I got was that it was a bit tired. I could not fault my reception - all was handled very well by a friendly staff and an efficient doorman. My Club Floor room was large, comfortable and well fitted and whilst it was not as clean as I would wish, I have no real complaints other than to make comment that the Club floor extras, mineral water, robe, etc, were not provided as they should have been. Its worthwhile reading what you have paid for and checking that you actually get it. Oh yes, and watch that shower in the bath (not seperate) the controls are counterintuitive. I only used the main restaurant (looked like a huge ballroom with tables) and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food from the rather limited menu. I enjoyed dinner there on the first day of my stay so I went back again the next day and had the same meal (!) but this time the quality had really faded - all was overcooked. IT access in the room was FFF (fine, fast and free) for the Club Floor but I did not use any of the spa facilities as I was too busy. I missed breakfast (again seemingly served in the abovementioned ballroom) as it was neither in the price nor provided in a Club Lounge. I also refuse to pay the best part of $45 for a light breakfast on top of an already expensive room (US$450+). However, on the price issue, if you want a good room, weekday, in a London financial City hotel, this is the sort of rate that is now being charged by all - it seems to have gone up exponentially in the last year. Finally, the Club Floor room had a late check out (14.00hrs) but when I asked to have this facility, I was told that they had changed their mind and I must check out by 11.00hrs. After I checked out early, stored my luggage with the concierge and then collected it again at 2.00pm, I was told on enquiry again, that I should have checked out at 14.00hrs as I was staying in a Club room ! ! The upshot was that, seemingly, a trainee was not up to speed with the Club floor rules and I had been misinformed - an apology at least would have been nice. An overall summary ? Expensive, friendly but aging fast - until they renovate and have more efficient staff, there are better options not 100meters away (Novotel, Mint Hotel, Apex etc).

I am not the type of person who complains often but I was really so disgusted with this hotel, I felt it necessary to warn other not to throw their money away on this far from 5 star hotel. When we arrived the check in desk was quiet with only one other guest in front of us so we did not have long to wait. The manageress firstly could not find our booking as she was searching under my first name instead of my surname (even though I had presented her with my confirmation email.) She was also rude enough to answer the ringing telephone when she was in the middle of our check in and her colleague was sitting idle beside her. We were given our check in cards and told to go to room 219 on the second floor and were directed to the elevator. Off we went to the second floor and found signs pointing to directions of rooms up to 218, no 219 to be seen. So, we dragged our luggage back down to reception (no one had offered to help with the bags) and spoke to the receptionist again. She could not figure out the reason for this and ensured us there was a room 219 on the computer....it took a further ten minutes to figure out that she had directed us to the wrong wing of the hotel. So off we went in the elevator on the other side of the building to find the mysterious room 219. When we finally arrived to our room we were greeted with a beautiful view of the tube stop which was around 5 meters from the window. The room itself was tiny with barely enough room to fit ourselves and our luggage. The bathroom was also tiny. No bathrobes provided in the rooms - these were only available upon request. Breakfast prices were extortionate with an extra 8 pounds being charged for hot breakfast and and extra 4 pounds per person for room service!! When the maid came to clean our room we left to give her space (far too limited for 3 people) when we returned we found it strange that our coats had been moved from the chair. Later when my boyfriend checked his pocket he discovered 20 euro had gone missing from his coat pocket. A drink in the very quiet bar later that evening took us fifteen minutes to be served. When checking out the receptionist asked how our stay was. We told him we were not at all happy with it. He did not however ask why or try to make amends at all.

After a long wait in front of the lifts - one being out of service - I get to my room (supposedly an \"executive king room\") and I can't believe my eyes. A place where sunlight can possibly never enter: the window faces the wall of another building - litterally less than a meter away - and the only view you get is a ventilation grid from the adjacent building. After inspecting the room itself, all worn out and definitely not very clean, I go to the reception asking for another room - something I've only done a couple of times in my lifetime. The staff is very helpful and diligent and gets me another room. Which turns out to be almost as dark and much smaller actually... A bit cleaner and with a bit of a view... on the nearby railway tracks - still not great and very depressing! But at this point I give up. I'm just here for business anyway. As the room is incredibly hot I need to put the airco at full power - which is very noisy. On the following day I decide to leave the airco on in order to cool down the room before I return, therefore I leave one of my 2 room keys in the slot which acts as a main switch for the power in the room - making sure however to switch off all the lights before I leave.

We stayed for 3 nights over the Easter weekend. The staff were lovely and the very helpful doorman directed us to an underground carpark a 5 minute walk from the hotel as there is very limited parking at the hotel itself. Check in was quick and easy. I was slightly disappointed with the room as it was quite small and dark. It was on a low floor and just level with a railway track beside the hotel. It was just a pity to be in such a dark room on what was a glorious weekend weatherwise so it is probably a good idea to request a higher room. Having said that the room was clean, very quiet, had plenty storage and all the facilities you would want and the shower was the most powerful one that I have ever used. I found the bed to be too soft but that is just personal preference. I used the gym and swimming pool during the stay and was impressed with both. Great variety of exercise machines with a seperate room for free weights. The pool is big and ideal if you like to do more than splash around. Some of the rooms are located in a seperate wing with no direct access to the leisure area without walking through the lobby so it is worth requesting a room near the leisure centre if like me you like to use the gym and then go back to the room to shower. The hotel is ideally located if like us you were in London as tourists. Tower Hill tube station is right next to the hotel as are the Tower of London and London Bridge. A quick trip on the tube will bring you anywhere else you want to go. Be aware of the fact that Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral only open for half days on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays to allow for services.

You can get some really good bargains here so check out the deals before booking. Location It is in a great location, just around the corner from Tower Hill tube station - so you can get anywhere in London on the tube, but it is miles away from the tacky touristy parts of west London. You could also pop around the corner to Fenchurch Street Station and have a day out at the seaside in Southend -on-Sea if you fancy a change from city life. Staff Staff are friendly and helpful although check in/check out can be slow. A special mention for the the concierge who was very helpful. Rooms The rooms are large and well decorated (lots of photos on tripadvisor) but don't have the supersize plasma screens (but do have a BOSE wave) but why would you want to watch TV when you're in London? Bathrooms are a bit on the small side. Some rooms overlook the train station so if you expect a view of the Tower of London you maybe disappointed - Ask if you want a view of ToL. Even though the rooms overlook the train station they are still reasonably quiet. Breakfast/Restaurants/Bar Breakfast is good, the usual all you can eat/self service buffet fare and cooked full English - I really wouldn't bother paying extra for the cooked breakfast. I didn't visit the restaurants as I tend to steer clear of hotel restaurants - much better to try one of the local restaurants - butlers wharf has plenty of choice and it just over the bridge.

We had no robes in our room so called down to the spa to ask if they were provided, I was told rather sternly 'we have towels and locker keys'! We did not time our trip to the spa well, as we arrived a large group of loud women on a hen party arrived, greatly disturbing the quiet. Even in the steam room you could her them at the other end of the pool, complete disregard for people trying to swim or relax. The steam room was dirty with a nasty greenish stain on the floor and it had far too much eucalyptus fragance in; stinging both mine and my partners eyes and I could taste it in my throat for a good time after.

This bothers me every time. The hotel has brochures in the lobby that say their recent upgrades include free Wi-Fi in all rooms and free bottled water in room. Nowhere in the room was this noted, no code given to us for the free Wi-Fi, and when I had trouble with accessing at gbp12 for 24 hours (charged twice) the receptionist told me the concierge could just give me a code... so, got that and asked them to take the charges off the bill.

Good at most things but not great\u201d", "Author": "MASWScreenwriter", "ReviewID": "UR87688278", "Content": "This is a review of the conference facilities at The Grange City Hotel based on the cumulative experiences of three events. Overall this hotel is extremely well located for access to the City of London and transport, as others have noted. It is literally one minute from Tower Hill tube station. The hotel does most things well but this is to be expected for a 5 star hotel. The conference rooms in the hotel are well equipped. The public spaces are reasonably spacious for central London although the main restaurant can become a little cheek-by-jowl at times. Service levels at lunchtimes during these periods were good (meaning little or no waiting for food and plates cleared a lightning speed, perhaps to discourage second helpings?). Comments on the food itself follow. During the days we were there in November 2010, there were a number of quite large events being run simultaneously. Most of the time this was not a problem; on one occasion we were interrupted in our business meeting by the noise of a large lunchtime party leaving and owing to the size of the party, this took some time. It is difficult to see how this could have been avoided except by improved soundproofing or by different scheduling. Not catastrophic but not desirable either. Food and drink were in the main good but with some disappointments; the conference room coffee was most definitely not up to 5 star standards and attracted a number of comments to that effect. Accompanying pasties and the like were acceptable but at this level more than acceptable is expected. Lunchtime food was adequate mostly well prepared, cooked and presented but the amount of choice was disappointing. This did not become more extensive even when the hotel was extremely busy. Service was in the main good but there were times when conference personnel were not available meaning they had to be hunted down, paged or telephoned, which should be unnecessary at this level. Overall, then, not perfect but certainly ok. The hotel gets four stars overall in this review because it is really quite good at most things. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t warrant a full five stars, which is a pity as it claims to be a 5 star hotel and it should. It is not far off. A more personal approach would help. That might mean more staff. A number of members of staff were particularly helpful once they had been located. Perhaps there should be a little less emphasis on the purely commercial aspects which, as other reviewers have noted, do seem to drive this hotel perhaps a little too strongly.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cCentral location, reasonably priced, rooms OK but not a \"luxury 5 star hotel\"\u201d", "Author": "zoothemoo", "ReviewID": "UR86316243", "Content": "Recently stayed 1 night on business here. Chose this hotel as it was well located for work purposes and the price, for London, was not too bad. The location is excellent and very easy to get to via public transport; right next to Tower Hill tube station. However, don't be taken in by the marketing on the website saying that it is a \"luxury 5 star hotel\" - it isn't. That said, the price (for advance bookings) wasn't 5 star either, so, can't really complain too much. The room I had was OK. It was clean with all the usual amenities, but the room and furnishings looked slightly worn and dated. There were also marks on the sofa in the room and parts of the bedlinen (though, to be fair, the bedlinen was clean. They looked like marks which could not be washed off by standard housekeeping.). The view from the room was into the office next door. However, the room was quiet and there was no traffic noise. The toilet and shower in the ensuite worked fine. However, don't expect a large bathroom. Toileteries provided by hotel were OK, but think the person sourcing the toileteries for the hotel should try them out first before putting them in the guestrooms. It's kind of pointless having complimentary toileteries when you can't use them because you can't get them out of the bottle (e.g. the conditioner). Air-conditioning worked fine, albeit quite noisy. You may need earplugs if you are a light sleeper and need the air-conditioning on. Bed was comfy enough. TV worked fine. Usual complimentary refreshments available. Did not use mini bar and wifi, so, can't comment on those. Breakfast was average. I tried the full English breakfast and the chef accidently missed off some items. However, my tip if you are having the full English is - avoid the scrambled eggs and go for the fried eggs instead. (It could be, of course, the kitchen just having an off day that morning.) Service was inconsistent - waiting staff was quick to take breakfast order but nobody offerred me tea / coffee. There were pastries and croissants available, but instead of being light & buttery, they were strangely stodgy. All things considered, my stay was OK. Would not come back if I had to pay full price but might consider it again, if there is a good offer available.

The carpets are thick and soft and the bed superlative! On booking we had requested a South-facing room with a view of the Tower and were told that this couldn't be guaranteed, and sadly on arrival the view from our room was a bit rubbish - ugly roofs and a glimpse of Fenchurch St station. This was the only negative and I guess someone has to have the rooms at the back! The best part about the Grange City is the spa downstairs, with a 25m pool, wonderful 'starlit' jacuzzi' and various steam and sauna rooms. We used it every day of our stay, even after checkout! Another high point was the continental breakfast, included in our room rate, which offered a substantial menu. On day 2 we upgraded to English Breakfast for \u00c2\u00a38 each and ordered it up to our room, which we would do again though not every day. The minibar prices are reasonable for a hotel - a big glass of wine for a fiver without having to leave the room is ok in my book! We ordered room service dinner the first night which was delicious and pretty reasonably priced. The hotel location is excellent, just minutes from the tube station and near the river. We walked along the South Bank to Borough food market, and had a coffee in St Katharine's Dock. In terms of things that could be improved, providing conditioner would be nice, as would a DVD player as the films on offer were very expensive (\u00c2\u00a310 rental) and the choice pretty limited (absolutely nothing we wanted to watch). Being able to guarantee a room with a view of the Tower would be nice, though I realise that this may not be possible for logistical reasons.

The buffet breakfast was extensive & there was plenty to eat with unlimited hot drinks.

We left with really mixed opinions on this hotel, the location is great, we had a fabulous view of the Tower Bridge by day and even more spectacular at night. But be warned once the business district closes down for the evening and on a friday night and the entire weekend, there are not a lot of dining options available. The worst thing about the hotel without a doubt were the miserable thieving staff. My husband made the mistake of asking for a bottle opener to be brought to the room, they refused to leave it claiming it was the only one in the hotel!? So every time my husband wanted a beer he had to request someone come with the opener which would then be promptly snatched back. After a few days we were growing tired of the inconvenience and requested it be left in our room, the staff member replied that it was not allowed as it would go missing-that's right, she accused us of wanting to steal it before we even got our hands on it. Another thing was the bar fridge, we didn't really consume anything from it due to the prices but we did use it to store our own things such as beer, fruit etc. Be warned that every time you move anything in the fridge the sensor detects this and charges you for it so everyday I had to go through the invoice that was pushed under the door crossing off all the things the fridge had thought we had consumed, so annoying. What a stupid concept too. We could also hear the family next door as the walls were quite thin. To top off our stay, when we returned home, my husband went to play his PSP only to find that the memory stick had been stolen. My husband contacted the hotel to report it and was told it would be investigated but of course never heard anything further. Needless to say when my husband returned to work and told his story of his stay this hotel was removed from the company's preferred hotel list.

I emailed them about a month before our stay and had great correspondance with the hotel. They emailed me, rang me and upgraded our room and I arranged for rose petals to be put on our bed. Check in was quick, we got there at 1.30pm and were shown straight to our rooms on the 9th floor. The rooms were of decent size, I don't know what people expect from hotel rooms - a house?!? TV worked (although who goes to London to watch TV??), there was a cupboard with kettle, tea and coffee etc, another with a mini bar, an iron and ironing board and a hair dryer. The room was clean, tidy and well kept. The bed was possibly the most comfortable bed ever! The hotel is walking distance to the Tower of London and is literally round the corner from Tower Hill underground which is on the district line so goes pretty much direct to central London. For \u00c2\u00a35.60 each you can get an all day pass for travel after 9.30am from zones 1 and 2 which covers all of the major sightseeing areas. The staff at the hotel were so friendly and more than helpful in showing us where to go and which tubes to catch when we were unsure as to where places were. We went to Madam Tussauds - get there early it opens at 9am and queue's get big but make sure you stay calm, the amount of foreign tourists in there who push in front of you and barge you out of the way is VERY annoying. We also went on the Eye which was good, queue's went down fast so didn't seem like it took ages to get on there, and went to see We Will Rock You which was fantastic. We ate at Garfunkels in Leicester Square but there seemed to be plenty of them about, I would reccommend NOT eating here, the food was rushed and not particularly nice... it seemed that because it was busy they wanted you in and out; they took our starter plates away and asked if we wanted coffee or dessert - surely in 10 minutes you can't eat two courses???!!! Back to the hotel... we also had free use of the pool, sauna, steam room, hot tub and aromatherapy room. Use these!! Amazing, relaxing and a great way to wind down after walking around London all day. The pool was great, they give you towels and its perfectly clean. Overall the hotel was perfect, I would go back tomorrow and definitely reccommend it. I'm sure people just like to moan over nothing - yes the internet and phone was expensive to use...as in all other hotels!!

We were more than happy with this arrangement. The room we were allocated had no view at all but, despite that, was wonderfully clean and comfortable. Knowing in advance how much meals and drinks would cost in such an establishment, we chose to eat and drink 'out' and, being in LONDON, there was quite a choice available! However, after watching the show that was the reason for our trip, we chose to use the hotel bar for our 'nightcap' and were well impressed with the service offered - although it was late into the evening. With a long trip home the next day, we decided to take advantage of the 'Continental Breakfast' that came with our room package and were allowed to eat ' as much as you like' style until we were satisfied. This was a good indication of the staff tolerances which were, without fail, superb. I would recommend this hotel to any person using these reviews.

On complaining the following morning we were offered a full english b/f as compensation, which we didn't want. But nothing off the bill. So we have been promised a disocunt next time we stay - lets see if that happens. Apparently it was due to some upgrade over night and \"this sometimes happens\" and has happened in the past. The buffet breakfast was OK for us, though the toast was cold as cooked on mass every half an hour or so. The cooked b/f was \u00c2\u00a320 extra per head. This was not advertised and the waiter went around asking all the guests if they wanted a full english - so I am sure that people had a surprise on checking out. We used the pool, which wasn't as bad as some of the reviews. I had informed the hotel that the booking was to celebrate a significant birthday but there was no little extras or mention of it - which was a bit disappointing.

The room was always cold, there was a foul smell from the water tap and the towels (presumably washed in the same water) also smelt very unpleasant. The tap water was undrinkable and there was no bottled water available in the room. The view was of the DLR platform, there was no net curtain so if you wanted privacy you had to have the curtains drawn and lights on.

Shocking experience! Imagine my excitement when my girlfriend surpised me on boxing day and said that she had booked a 5 star hotel for a nice relaxing stress free break between 27th December until 1st January..... Well let me tell you exactly how that excitement vanished almost immediately.... We only live in Sutton in Surrey so to get the train to the hotel would have only taken 40 minutes but due to the fact that we had luggage I suggested I call and ask if they had a car park for guests staying at the hotel. After having to explain my simple question in several different ways , I was put on hold and another person answered - I had to once again explain my question but the other person (on reception) wouldnt tell me the anwer until I had given all our booking details and references etc, aarrrgggg! ...before declaring that YES the hotel had parking available to guests and YES we were entitled to one....Great! I thought , even if that took ten minutes to find the answer... So we set off and and an hour and a half later we arrived at the hotel. Great looking hotel from the outside so we were delighted. We joined the back of queuing cars, appearing to be going down to the car park (under the hotel) and after 10 minutes of going nowwhere my girlfriend went in to reception to find out where to park exactly and what the hold up was. We were told the parking was 5 minutes away and would cost \u00c2\u00a32.50 a day - ok, so not exactly what we were expecting but ok we could deal with that...We then asked for directions, which for some reason didnt seem readily available and were then handed some after another 5 minutes of waiting and to our dis-belief on the directions was the cost of the car park - \u00c2\u00a32.50 PER HOUR!!! so our stay was going to cost us an extra \u00c2\u00a3150 odd quid , even though someone from the hotel had confirmed that parking was included.... We asked to see the manager to discuss this and the situation only got worse......We waited another 5 minutes for him to come down to reception only to be told that he didnt believe one of his staff would have said parking was included and that unless I could provide him with a name there wasnt anything he could do?!! I couldnt believe this....I was beign accused of lying and besides the staff never introduce who they are when answering the phones so this was impossible.... We asked him to be a little flexible as there was eveidentally plenty of parking underneath the hotel, which has a large conferencing facility....but he once again repeated that there wasnt anything he could do. I explained that we would not have driven had it not been for this mis-information we were given and that I wanted to know about a refund (I only got to this point because he appeared to really not care) as we were not happy and would stay at another hotel...He then walked off and came back 10 minutes later with a solution we thought - NO! he merely pointed out that we would still have to pay the bill in full as we hadnt cancelled 24 hours prior .... This was aready a nightmare and reduced my girlfriend to tears right there in reception and wasnt exactly the first impressions written about in the brochure!....By this point we had been at the hotel for half an hour , our car was in a non-moving queue outside , we wasnt checked in and the hotel management were basically saying we were liars!! Great Start...!! To be fair to them , as it was a bank holiday the hotel manager suggested we park our car oustide the hotel on a yellow until just before 6am and then move it to the paying car park so save on a days rate...Due to the fact this was supposed to be a relaxing holiday we didnt take him up on that offer. Having been told we would lose over \u00c2\u00a3500 by cancelling we reluctantly parked the car at the pay car park and trudged the 10-15 minute walk back with our bags but it didnt end there! The room we were allocated was actually on the same level as the train station platform , so people who were bored could look straight in to our room which was not very private at al and felt very unsecurel....We swiftly returned to reception to ask to be moved and were (to their credit) given a room on the 8th floor which was clean and a standard double, which was to be our home for 5 days.... I will simply sum up our remaining experience : 1) We reported to reception that we had a message appear on our phone but couldnt acccess it as when you followed the instructions it died - the girl didnt know the answer but would call back - no call back 2) Even with the heating on the rooms were very cold and we had to request an extra duvet. 3) After a couple of days we thought to ask consierge if they could find out if there was any other (cheaper) car parks in the area - they said they would phone back - yep, you guessed it....! no call back. 4) There was never a welcome or goodbye by any of the staff throughout our stay and was a very odd and unfriendly atmosphere. 5) The walls are too thin and you can hear conversations people are having either side of your room at night. 6) Some rooms have blaconys and we were unlucky enough to be above one that had - The noise from these balconies from people partying or smoking has already been mentioned in a review so I wont go into it - just that it is loud! On the plus side, I have to say the gym and spa was a delight and we enjoyed this very much and the location is perfect.

Just a simple small TFT screen which was far too small to look at from the bed. The airco was good, both cold and warmer. The quality of the bed and other furniture was excellent. The hotel is hidden just behind the underground station Tower Hill. We found out that this station is unaccessable for wheelchairs, so - once we arrived on the station - we could not exit!!!!

The hotel is in a great location, near to the Tower Hill underground station and of course to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. I had a Superior Room (which is - if I understand correctly - their standard room). The room was facing towards the Fenchurch Street railway station, but you could hear no noise from outside (however see comment below from the noise inside). Bed was big and comfortable with plenty of pillows. There was enough space in the room for one person with not too much of luggage, and the bathroom was ok as well. The rate did not include breakfast and as the normal rate for breakfast is quite expensive, I had my breakfast outside of the hotel. There is for example a Weatherspoon pub serving nice breakfast close to the hotel. While the hotel is nice enough, I would not pay the normal rate for it. However, I was in London for sightseeing, and did not e.g. use the spa, which was included in the room rate. As a summary: + good location + nice, comfortable rooms + extra plus for meeting couple of my personal expectations: good overall lighting in the room and a paper basket in the room (not only in the bathroom) - may sound funny but comes from longer periods spent at hotels in business trips. - My door was left open by the staff one day. Nothing was missing, but still not very pleasant. They were very apologetic and said it was the first time this has happened. - Paper thin walls.

I usually stay at Le Meridien on Picadilly Circus, but I wanted to be closer to The Tower this time, so I booked a night at The Grange on Cooper's Row. Even before arriving, I was very impressed with the facilities and with the room furnishings, as well as the rates. Neither of these impressions changed when we arrived (my wife and mother were with me). Over the next 24 hours, a few things happened (or didn't happen) that have soured my opinion, and all but guaranteed that I won't be returning. Here, in no particular order of importance, is my list: 1. We arrived from the airport at about 9 am, far to early to check in (as we expected), but we wanted to drop off our luggage so that we could explore the town. The front desk check in was handled smoothly, efficiently, and professionally. I was very impressed. However, when we went to leave our bags with the porter/concierge, there was a delay. Apparently, it is your procedure to tag each piece of luggage with an identification tag. These tags are hand written. We had 8 bags/items, so it took awhile for this to be completed. Afterwards, I tipped the porter. I was expecting that those bags would be delivered to our room once it was ready, but that did not happen. As a convenience for future patrons, I would consider making this part of the services offered. Also, to speed up the identification process, it would be a lot faster if you had a roll of stickers with two copies of each identification number. This way, the porter could simply apply one of the labels to each bag, and the duplicate label to some sort of receipt that you would give the customer. I believe this would cut a lot of wasted time out of the process. We left to go \"see the sights\" of London We returned about 4pm. 2. Upon reaching our room on the 4th floor, we noticed that there were only 2 sets of towels (even though we had clearly reserved the room for 3 people). We notified housekeeping and they quickly brought us another set. This might just be an oversight, or there could be a lack of communication between the reservation desk and housekeeping. You might want to check this out. 3. We wanted to get some ice, so we asked the operator if there were any ice machines. She said that there was one on every floor. After vainly searching for 10-15 minutes (including the 3rd floor and 5th floor), we started asking hotel employees and guests that we found in the hallways if they knew where the machines were. No one (including the employees) knew. We finally called down and had a bucket delivered to us. I still don't know (and neither do your employees) whether or not there is an ice machine on the 4th floor, and if there is, where? For the future guests, you need to let your employees know if you have ice machines or not, and if so, where they are located. 4. One of the reading lights by the side of one of the beds did not work (the bulb would flicker on and off, and then go dark). We alerted someone (I don't remember who we called, operator, housekeeping, or someone else), but it was never fixed. (Room 418 if you're interested). Since I don't remember who I called, or what happened after that, I can't make any recommendations on how to prevent the problem from happening again. We left to go see a show We returned late (about 11 pm) 5. Someone had rented the courtyard below our window (as well as a lot of other peoples' windows) for a \"Sweet 16\" party. As you can imagine, the noise from 25-35 excited 16-year-olds can be quite great. I called the front desk, and they said that the party would be going until Midnight. Let me try to describe how loud it was. With the window open, the excited screams, laughter, and conversation made it difficult to have a normal conversation. With the window closed, you could still clearly hear names of people, some conversation, most laughter, and all screams. With the window closed, the curtains closed, and the air conditioning blasting, you could still hear screams, names of people and laughter. Keep in mind, I am on the fourth floor. I don't even want to imagine what is was like for people below us. If someone had told me as I was booking the room, \"Sir, just so you know, dozens of excited teenagers will be partying under your window until at least midnight - precluding you from getting a decent night's sleep before your flight tomorrow\" I would have been grateful, and booked elsewhere. Instead, I paid a large amount to be sleep-deprived. If you continue to rent this courtyard out for parties, then future guests should be warned, or a 10pm curfew should be imposed. 6. Room 418 overlooks the courtyard, a section of old city wall, and not much else. Perhaps the higher floors are visible from elsewhere in the city, I don't know. There are several large bright spotlights that are in the courtyard shining on to the side of the hotel. If the hotel is visible from elsewhere, I could understand this, but I don't think it is. The lights illuminate the curtains, making the room \"less than dark\" throughout the night. For the sake of guests, as well as conserving energy, I would recommend removing the lights, or at least, turning them off after 10pm. 7. Wandering downstairs in a sleep deprived state, looking for breakfast, around 7am the next morning, we entered the Forum Restaurant for the breakfast buffet. Now, it could be entirely my fault, but at no point was I made aware of how much the buffet was going to cost. I did see (on a side menu on our table) that a \"full English breakfast\" was available for an additional fee of \u00c2\u00a38.95. Since the majority of the buffet consisted of fruit, toast, croissants, or cereal, I did not think it would cost that much. Certainly not as much as the full English breakfast. You can imagine my surprise when (still in a sleepy state) we went to check out and I found that our buffet was over \u00c2\u00a321 each. I realize that things are very expensive in London, but if you can buy a full English breakfast for \u00c2\u00a38.95, than surely, a plate of fruit, a croissant, and some juice should be priced the same or less, right? So, to sum up about the Forum, overpriced, and lacking pricing signage (I think). Also, on the buffet, the butter was molded into a floral pattern and stored on a bed of ice. It was pretty, but have you every tried to spread ice cold butter onto a croissant or piece of toast? You will end up ripping it to shreds. 8. I was told by the front desk, and the porter/concierge, that when we needed a ride to Heathrow, that we should let them \"book it\" as they can make sure that we get the best rate (a flat rate) of \u00c2\u00a365. We did so. When we got to the airport, the taxi driver said our bill was \u00c2\u00a367.95 plus a \u00c2\u00a32.00 booking fee. I explained to him that I was told it would be a flat fee of \u00c2\u00a365.00, but that didn't hold much weight. The meter verified his side of the bill, so I am not sure who is in the wrong here. What I do know is that it cost me an extra \u00c2\u00a32.00 because the hotel called him, rather than me walking out to either of the 3 other taxis waiting out front. What I don't know is whether or not the aforementioned \"flat fee of \u00c2\u00a365 to Heathrow\" actually exists, or is merely an unsubstantiated rumor (like the existence of ice machines on the 4th floor). Either way, like the ice machines, the staff needs to be informed as to the actual facts of the situation. So, in summary, the actual hotel building is amazing and handsome. There are some training issues, and some procedures could be improved. I am getting ready to write a review for your hotel on the website I booked it through (Orbitz I think), and I am having a dilemma. I'm not really sure how to condense all I just wrote about to you into a short review, or whether or not the review will be a good one or not. Right now, I think I will just wait to hear your thoughts, and then write the review.\" Their response to my areas of concern were to either defend the policy in question, or to \"look into it further\". The lights shining into the room, and the non-disclosed over priced breakfast buffet of fruit and toast for \u00c2\u00a321 really ticks me off. Booking the area right underneath the bedroom windows for screaming teenagers until midnight is inexcusable in a \"high end\" hotel.", "Date": "August 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SOUTH EAST", "Title": "\u201cGOOD LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "ALECTRICIANS", "ReviewID": "UR37165734", "Content": "Very near to the tower of London, Tower bridge etc. The hotel is all you would expect from this standard of hotel.

It is the staff and administration that ruined our stay. We were a group of 11 and had 5 rooms booked. The things that went wrong were:- 1 We arrived at 11.30am to drop off our bags. We offered to do the check-in paperwork then accepting that the keys would not be ready so early. The girl on the desk started to do this but then said they were so busy could we do it later. We had no problem with this but when we complained later to the manager about room allocation this was held against us (see below!). 2 We arrived back at 6 and needed to leave at 7. We again queued for half an hour to check-in. We were then told one room was not ready and they needed another 30 minutes. We explained that we had a restaurant booking and had to get ready. They offered us an executive double room rather than a twin double which was reluctantly accepted - it is not ideal to share a bed with someone you don't know that well when you have booked a twin double room for that reason. It also does seem rather late to still be servicing rooms. 3 We had booked 5 rooms each with two double beds. In one room three of us were going to share and so we had to have enough room. We pointed this out when checking in and the girl said all the rooms had two double beds in (apart from the king room which we had accepted). We went to the room and lo and behold - two single beds. We went down and asked if someone else had our room in our party - she checked and said no all the rooms had two single beds. A change in stance there. In fact everyone had different rooms and only one of them would have slept 3. She said we could have a rollaway bed and we had been advised of the \u00c2\u00a340 charge - we had been but that was in addition to the 2 double beds if one of us had wanted to share. It was never our intention to use it as they are so uncomfortable. We reluctantly agreed to have the rollaway but refused to pay for it. It was the size of a small child's bed with a mattress an inch thick - lovely for a supposed 5 star hotel. When we all met up after rushing to get ready the 5 double rooms were:- One single twin with a rollaway One double with an uncomfortable sofa bed One executive double as the room wasn't ready which was the same standard as a normal room One single twin One massive room with two double beds, two sofas and a study! When we complained about the doubles/rollaway etc in the morning the duty manager said the trouble was we had checked in too late and our rooms had been reallocated. He didn't seem to care that we had wanted to check in at 11.30 and went away at their request. He was very unhelpful and said there was nothing he could do but ask someone to phone us this week. We came to the hotel for a stress-free getaway and this made us all very stressed. The reception staff were all very unhelpful and seemed to say what they thought you wanted to hear rather than the truth! The breakfast was very poor - hardly anything nice at the buffet. Last time everyone had a cooked breakfast included - it was extra this time so we declined. The tea had been made in a coffee pot and tasted very odd. The service was extremely slow. There were a couple of good points - one of our party had forgotten a toothbrush and reception put one in the room (but then wouldn't most hotels do this?) and the swimming pool staff were really friendly. Neither are particularly exceptional points but with such poor service elsewhere they were noticable. We were all very disappointed - especially those who had stayed before and had expected so much better. Apparently they are shortstaffed as lots of staff have left to go to a new hotel. It shows and I suggest you leave plenty of time to check in/out, drop off and pick up cases, have breakfast etc etc as nothing gets done with any urgency.

One dealing with another guest and the other totally ignored us. Not 5 star service. We were left waiting 10 minutes. It wasn't a very enjoyable stay. I got to the room and just collapsed on the bed to find the 2 pillows next to me had obvious stains on them. The bed was also covered in flint and crumbs. At this point I couldn't be bothered to complain as I was tired. I just put the cushions on the floor and brushed the bed down. I also tried to access the wireless internet with my ipod touch. The hotel had a page charging guests to use internet! I have stayed in many 5 star hotels internationally and this was the first where you were charged to use internet access wirelessly. Plus I had stayed at 2 other 3 star hotels earlier in the week and they both had free wireless access. I therefore called reception to speak about the room and the internet connection. One of the desk staff came to the room. I let him in and he was on a mobile phone and continued his conversation standing in the room for a few minutes. When he got off the phone he took one of the dirty and stained pillows, apologised, and then connected the internet for free due to the inconvenience. I had mentioned the room size and to be fair he did offer to change it, however, I declined as I didn't want to inconvenience the staff at such a late hour, plus I was just so tired. I did mention the issues in the morning at the desk when checking out. The only comment from the reception staff was that the issues would go on my record. I do not see how that would make any difference to me or acknowledge the issues. I hope review is not coming over as overly picky and aggressive. I am not a person who focuses on small negative things. However, this hotel advertises itself as a luxury 5 star hotel and my experience was not 5 star.

I called straight back, but my booking was gone and the hotel was full. The card details I provided were correct. Furthermore, Barclays tells me that no attempt was even made to charge my debit card. Here's what happened: the hotel decided to bump people who'd booked early at a good rate, so they could sell last minute rooms at a higher rate. Then, they decided to lie to me about it. When I complained to management, they basically said there was nothing they could do. In the end, I had no choice but to book an inferior hotel, at nearly \u00c2\u00a3200 per night. Grange Hotels clearly has a policy of bumping early- reservations like mine, to make room for profitable last minute bookings. You may still decide to stay with Grange Hotels.

The overall feel of the public areas in the hotel are under stated wealth and glamour. Decorated in chic almost art deco style in parts, this hotel would cater to the whims of the most descerning visitor. Continental Breakfast - included in the room rate was a morning delight! A vast array of pastries, fruit, cereals, breads, yoghurt, cold meats, juice etc etc laid on in style and buffet format so you can return as long as your tummy will allow!! For a small fee full English breakfast is also available. The bar although quite darkly lit ,is a comfortable chill out zone and fabulous area to relax with friends. The extensive wine list offers some outstanding vintages and I was pleasantly surprised to find that for a hotel of this calibre and location did not charge sky high prices.

I have stayed in a few hotels in london previously and used to live there so have a good knowledge of the city. Some reviews state that the hotel is not very central and a little out of the way but considering it is just a step out of Tower Hill tube station and overlooking 2 of the most famous buildings in london (The Tower of London and Tower Bridge) I consider this to be in the heart of london. It is barley a 10 minute tube ride to Embankment station from where you can walk to Covent Garden or Leicester Square in 5 minutes. I booked the hotel after many weeks of searching for a good deal in london on all the usual sites. I have normally settled for a basic holiday inn or thistle hotel but this time I wanted something a bit more special. I ended up booking the hotel through the Grange Hotels website and got 2 nights with continental breakfast for about \u00c2\u00a3188 total. Barely anymore than a basic holiday inn in cost! I had seen other peoples reviews saying that they had been upgraded when staying on a weekend so I took the liberty of asking for a room with a view of the Tower in the comments section of the booking form and on arrival I couldn't have been more pleased when the receptionist said \"we have a very nice room for you\". The room was indeed very nice and the view was magical. Panoramic views of the Tower, the bridge and the thames. I could not have asked for better. Check in was also instant which surprised me due to poor reviews I have read previously. This hotel also has a very nice pool which is open for long hours and is quite quiet therefore it is worth bringing along your swimming gear. There is also a jacuzzi, steam room, sauna and aromatherapy room. Breakfast was fairly standard for a continental but I didn't go there for the food. It was nice to have hot boiled eggs along with all the usual pastries, cereals, meat, cheeses, yoghurt and fruit. Our room was also generously stocked with a large selection of teas, coffee and biscuits. Overall our stay was fantastic.

When we got to our room, a standard double, we were a little disappointed as the room was much smaller than the one we had stayed in last year.

The selection for the continental breakfast is okay but nothing to look forward to in the morning. 2) The pool, it needs a bit of a clean.

We got a deal on the hotel website including continental breakfast and access to the hotel golf simulator. We arrived early in the morning and had our luggage stored by the efficient concierge (for free) until our rooms were ready. The lobby and other public areas were very well appointed, and the inital impression was very good. This only got better when we got into our room. It was spacious, tastefully furnished, and well equipped with lots of tea/coffee, toiletries etc (probably more coffee than any other hotel I've stayed in!). The entry hallway to the room was nice and wide, and in addition to the bed there was a sofa, two chairs and a coffee table, with a writing table and TV etc along the side of the room. The beds were two singles pushed together, but after the first night the staff made the beds up as one double. The bathroom wasn't enormous, but was a good size and certainly more than sufficient for our needs during our stay. Breakfast was good, and included lots of pastries in addition to the usual continental breakfast. There were signs warning people to eat early at weekends to avoid delays in being seated for breakfast, but when we turned up (late) on Saturday and Sunday mornings there were no delays whatsoever. Our one complaint during the stay was about noise on the Saturday night. There was a ball in a function suite below our room, and the music was quite loud until about midnight. I think this was caused by the opening of a fire door in the function room though because we hadn't noticed the noise until quite late in the evening, and it wasn't such an issue that we bothered to phone the front desk. The hotel location is perfect for tourists and business trips, situated essentially next door to Tower Hill underground station (zone 1) and within 2 minutes walk of the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. The leisure facilities are also noteworthy - the sauna, aromatherapy, steam room and pool were all great, and the whirlpool heavenly after a day pounding the streets of London! We also tried the golf simulator which was amazing fun, though I must say it was my first experience of such things so I really can't compare it to anything else. It seemed quite good though! In summary the Grange City hotel provided a great setting for a weekend in London, with luxurious rooms, good food, very effective staff, and a great location for walking to local sights and getting onto the underground network for going further afield.

We stayed in room 409 overlooking the patio area of the hotel where they host outdoor events. The room itself had two double beds and was very clean.

The hotel has a huge indoor swimming pool, hot tub, steam room, sauna and aromatherapy room. A nice thing to have after a long day of walking and sightseeing. Hotel breakfast (continental) was included on the Saturday and Sunday morning which was plenty for us. All you could eat, boiled eggs, toast, cereals, fruit, cheese, etc. You could upgrade to an English breakfast but we chose not to as this was enough for us. The only thing I would like to mention here is that the hotel is located in a business area so there is little to no nightlife nearby the hotel and on weekends its very quiet. This was suitable to us as we had a teenager with us and weren't looking for nightlife. Also, on the Saturday night there was an event taking place at the hotel for the City of London Police Officers... they had the music going downstairs until about 2:00 a.m. and you could hear the bass from the music as we were on the 4th floor - this would have to be the only negative. When we mentioned to the front desk upon checkout they said that normally these events only go on until midnight but I guess the attendees had asked if they could extend it for a couple of hours, I would assume if you were staying on the third floor right above this area it would have been very difficult to sleep.

Having read the reviews I was a bit concerned - I did note on checking in that a business traveller asked if the room was (and gesticulated left). I was shown to the right. On going up in the lifts some American tourists were complaining about the railway line noise. When we went up to the room I looked out the window and we were right over a railway track. I mean, right over. The room was very cramped for a hotel which advertises itself as having some of the biggest rooms in London (with great views .... of a railroad). Anyway, I hemmed and hawed about it but finally rang up to complain. It was costing 160 euro for the night after all (plus I hadn't liked when I phoned to book being quoted 110 sterling, only to discover that was exclusive of VAT. I've never been quoted a hotel rate exclusive of VAT before and that made me wary of the company - unfortunately because of the London Marathon I couldn't get anything else at that late stage). Anyway, on complaining I was upgraded to a much better, larger room at the front of the hotel with a view of the bridge. So obviously there are some rooms for the gillies. The breakfast was unbelievably bad. I was asked if I wanted tea or coffee and was given coffee from a tray which the waitress was carrying around - as a result it was barely tepid and like sludge. I asked later for another pot and it was slightly warmer but still sludgy. I gave up on the coffee and went to the hot water dispenser to make a cup of hot tea only there was no water. The continental breakfast consisted of a plate with three meats - a poor quality ham, a turkey and a salami. There was another plate of processed sliced cheese. That's not a continental breakfast and particularly in a five star. Apart from that there were boiled eggs and some reasonable bread rolls, and there were croissants and danish pastries that were completely inedible. This wasn't merely a personal observation, by the way, others were complaining about the cold coffee and the inedible food. All in all, I wouldn't be back. The pluses were that it is convenient to the train station (har har, especially from the rooms on the right hand side!). Our rooms were clean, the pool is lovely but more aimed at adults than kids. I didn't visit the sauna or spa because I'd a kid with me. Oh, one thing - the cleanliness of the pool left a bit to be desired. An employee asked me if there was a key in the pool - when I went to pick it up it was a plaster. My daughter was swimming underwater and found three plasters just in one lane. I was in the jacuzzi and there was a dressing just near the step on the tiles outside. I ignored it, gritted my teeth and got in.

A full english was \u00c2\u00a38 supplement which I think is probably quite good, it looked okay when it came out too. The swimming pool and spa facilities ARE excellent, I spent a good hour and a half enjoying the gorgeous pool/jacuzzi/steam room/sauna/aromatherapy room. Friends booked massages and they said that it was very good. Molton Brown in the changing rooms and no \u00c2\u00a31 coin lockers - thumbs up. There were two children in the pool area whilst I was there but I don't think that there was much for them to do - no toys around and the pool was split into slow/fast and lesson swimming lanes - also, there is no shallow end which I think children rely on. I wouldn't take children to this swimming pool. Check out was good, there was no problem for me to split the bill will my room mate who had not checked out yet.

The room was nice so did not ask to be moved as we were on the 7th Floor on the renovated side, didn't want to risk what we might have got if we had moved. The hotel has nice facilities with the pool, jacuzzi and sauna/steam rooms. The new rooms are just like the pictures on the website and have good facilities tv with pay per view movies, mini bar etc. The main down fall was the restaurant, the hotel has 4 to choose from we chose the forum restaurant which is the hotels main restaurant and thought this would be the best as it was much dearer than the others as well. We had a long wait for our food. I don't know what was going on there but have a suspicion either there was only 1 person in the kitchen or that kitchen was doing all the food for all the restaurants or you would think so for the time it took for 2 soups and a prawn cocktail to arrive! It was the same for other guests from what I could tell. On to the food.... Well starters were ok that was the best it got. Main courses I had fish which was satisfactory not much I can complain about but not much to comment on either. My mum had pasta which was very bland and only warm but swimming in oil - not very nice at all and my sister had Risotto = It was basically a hard pile of bland over cooked rice. We complained about the risotto and said the pasta was also not good. We were offered complimentary tea and were told the risotto would be taken off the bill which was good. But then the bill arrived still with the risotto when we raised this we were told we had had free tea and they couldn't take it off the bill as it was already done.? I couldn't bear to argue so just paid. After dinner we used the pool and facilities then back to the room for an uncomfortable nights sleep as the bed had a rather large well in the centre and sharing meant I was sleeping on the lumpy edge of the well. In the morning breakfast - continental was included but english would have been an extra \u00c2\u00a38 each so we stayed with continental not a huge choice but I managed to find something to eat - the hard boilded eggs were ok and the cold chewy toast was actually quite nice in a weird way. Lots of tiptree jam and marmalaide to choose from too. On check out I mentioned the dinner problems and was offered to speak to the manager so I did and he refunded the cost of the risotto without much fuss. Over all The only thing this hotel has going for it is its pool and gym facilities and the decor of the refurbished rooms is quite nice. Other than that I would say it is average Not 5*, more like 3* or 4* if im very generouse. Also just to mention our room was supposed to be refurbished which it looked like apart from the bath had holes in the enamel/ceramic - only used the shower so wasn't too bothered but spoilt the overall look - if you were expecting 5* perfection. Kind of was for the price ! as was dearer than 3 or 4* which we had also looked at.

We got the double ensuite room \u00c2\u00a380.00 late deal weekend on offer and rang in advance to request a view room as other reviewers had suggested some rooms were not very well appointed. We found the hotel easily and parked the car in the Tower Gate car park for a bargain \u00c2\u00a32.50 for the weekend!! On arrival at the hotel, a very pleasant and efficient trainiee receptionist checked us in without delay. She apologised that they had not been able to allocate us a room with a view of the Tower so hoped we would not be too dissapointed with an upgraded room with a limited tower view. She did explain that they would \"hold\" a \u00c2\u00a350 room guarantee for any potential use of the mini bar and this is quite normal in 5* hotels. However we will just check to make sure our credit card hasn't been charged as mistakes can, and do, happen. Our room on the 6th floor was lovely. It was very large (two very comfy double beds, 2 sofas and a coffee table) and spotlessly clean. Although it overlooked a courtyard and we could only see one turret of the Tower of London, we felt we'd got a bargain! We used the pool, sauna and steam room which were all very nice. The pool was warm. Some families with children were using the pool as it was the weekend but they were well behaved and we were still able to swim lengths without interuption. Fresh, clean towels are provided in the leisure area. We did not use the Gym but it looked excellent. Lots of very up-to-date, well looked after equipment and nicely air conditioned. In the evening we walked from the hotel to the few bars and restaurants closeby. What we hadn't expected was that because of the area being primarily the financial district many of the bars and hotels didn't open at the weekend. That was a shame since we passed some very interesting eateries which we would have liked to have tried. In the end it was a good old Pizza Express that satisfied our hunger. Continental breakfast was included, although we could have upgraded to full English for an additional \u00c2\u00a35.60. We felt it wasn't necessary and to be honest it wouldn't have been. The continental buffet offered a vast array of juices, fresh fruit, cerals, dried fruit and nuts, yoghurts, cold meats, cheese and boiled eggs, croissants, toast, jam, bread rolls, danish pastries and copious amounts of freshly poured tea and coffee. We found more than enough to fill us up for the day and we found the breakfast service staff were excellent. We checked out at 10.30 without any delay and whilst we stood contemplating whether to leave our bags at the hotel whilst we explored a bit ,a young bell boy appeared beside us and offered to store our luggage if we would like......we hadn't even needed to ask! The tube station is just a stones throw from the hotel and access to and from central london is excellent. We decided to spend our day in Covent Garden which is always a pleasure. We returned about 4.30 pm and were quickly reuinted with our luggage. Once again the service was excellent and with a smile. Overall we had an excellent experience with the Grange City Hotel, and for the \u00c2\u00a380 we paid we have no complaints at all.

Very disappointing! It is also important to know that on arrival I was also asked for a fee of \u00c2\u00a375 a night for use of the mini bar and telephone etc however I refused as I was not informed of such charges.

In addition I requested a massage in the same room as my partner, guess what.....yep we ended up in different rooms and the massage was also quite poor. On the positive the bed was extremely nice, big and comfy, however following a day walking about anywhere would do and payment for this seems a luxury not needed.The bathroom was nice, however nothing special and nothing my travellodge room in the past has not provided! The location is good and very close to the underground, there are bars and restaurants within 5 minutes walk however not enough to satisfy a complete night and more exploring would be needed.

We had a few complaints about the cleanliness of the room and the rates. Since we were staying at the hotel over a weekend, we should have been given the weekend internet rates which included English breakfast. However, since we booked through my husband's company's travel agent, we were given the set corporate rate which were more than double the weekend rates on the Grange's website. When we complained to the Grange, they refused to give us an adjustment, and suggested having the travel agent cancel the 2 nights and rebook it on the Grange's site, but we were not satisfied with this solution. We were also very unhappy with the amount of dust & dirt in the room and the toilet appeared to have not been cleaned in over a week. We had the manager on duty, Ashey Ameer, come up to the room to inspect the room, and he immediately offered to upgrade our room the next day and also gave us full English breakfast for the duration of our stay. When we came back to our new room the next day, our jaws almost hit the floor. Our room was on the 12th floor - the penthouse floor - and was a 2-room suite with a super king sized bed, chandeliers, bathroom with tub and separate stall shower, Molton Brown bath products, 2 plasma TV's, desk with computer, the works. We were given a bottle of champagne, a fruit platter and truffles as well. The room also had a balcony with an amazing view of the Tower Bridge and the Tower of London. We felt like rock stars, and were pretty much treated that way for the rest of our stay. It pays to complain, if you do indeed have legitimate complaints as we did. We did order room service a few times, no issues there, food was always good and service was quick.

We would definitely suggest making a reservation for lunch at the The Wine Library which is right next door to the hotel and does a wine lunch for GBP 15.95 per person.

The manager refused to apologize, since he said we could not prove there were stolen items. So, at around 9:30pm my two sons and I went to the police department to file a report. The officer was so kind and said she would call the hotel and have some words with Benjamin about why one of the most expensive hotels in London would treat a guest so shabbily in addition to enquiring about the incident. By the time we returned to the room from the police station, the manager called and left a message stating that the police officer called him and that there was nothing he could do until he talked to housekeeping, but he would get back to me. Even at this point, there was no apology or concern for our lost goods. Guess what? We checked out of the hotel on Christmas Eve morning and I still have not heard from Benjamin. What a pathetic manager for such a lovely facility. Shame on the Grange for allowing its visitors to be victimized twice: once through a robbery from our room and secondly from the manager's reaction.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cIf you want good service & enjoy cooked breakfast forget it !!\u201d", "Author": "Expat_Critic", "ReviewID": "UR11651692", "Content": "Stayed here 3 times on business now and it doesn't get any better, medioca at best if you are used to the standard of service experienced in 5* hotels in asia this barely registers half a *.

It rained for most of the day but the church service was beautiful, dinner was absolutely lovely and everyone was up and dancing as soon as the disco started. The only thing that spoilt the weekend was the Grange City Hotel. I arrived on Friday evening, with a room allocation of 12 rooms and several hungry wedding guests looking to check in and get the wedding weekend underway. Personally, checking in took me 40 minutes. That's 20 minutes waiting to be served and another 20 minutes from the time I reached the desk till I had my room card in my hand. The reason given was that the receptionist wanted to \"find me an extra special room\". From listening to his increasingly worried phonecalls it was clear that, actually, no room had been allocated to me and he was trying to find a vacant one. At the Grange City guests have to pay in full for their accommodation (in advance) at check in and then also put their card through again for pre-authorisation. When checking out, you then have to pay again for anything subsequently purchased. This system is apparently in place to 'speed up the process' - what it actually means is that everything is duplicated and extremely slow. Rooms are also not allocated in advance, as the hotel apparently had a problem with people not turning up. The queue at reception was enormous - it continued to be so, as far as I could tell, for the entire weekend, regardless of what time of day it was. There were never less than 4 people waiting at any one time. At one point there were eighteen. It then took me another 15 minutes to a) find someone who could find the bags I had left with the hotel earlier, b) find my wedding dress, and c) actually work out how to hand them over to me so I could go up to my room. Almost an hour later, and with some of my guests still waiting to check in as only one computer terminal now appeared to be working, I went up to the 10th floor. On entering my room, it soon became clear that the \"extra special room\" was actually directly over the train line, with the station announcements clearly audible through the double glazing. The room itself was completely uninspiring and felt much more like a mediocre 3 star than a 5 star hotel room - tiny, a fake wood effect desk, no hairdryer, 2 small towels and a telephone that looked like a throwback to the 1970s. The next day I asked that my makeup artist be sent up to my sister's room, as we would be getting ready together. 20 minutes after her arrival at the hotel, she rang me on my mobile to ask which room I was in, as no one in reception had any idea - apparently she had been standing at reception for 20 minutes while someone tried to access the computer system, with no success. All the staff in the immediate area denied all knowledge of having spoken to me. While my sister and I were getting ready, my (then) fiancee was at our house arguing with the Grange Hotel booking service - someone from the Grange Group called him at 10am to demand an explanation for why he had been a \"no show\" at the hotel. Despite trying to explain that he was not due at the hotel till that evening, the person on the phone ended the call insisting that he had not arrived and that his booking had therefore been cancelled. Not what you need on the morning of your wedding, My sister asked for a black cab to take us to the church (5 minutes away by car) - having agreed to book a black cab, the concierge booked a Mercedes, which proceeded to get lost on the way, despite us telling the driver that he was going to wrong way, and then charged us \u00c2\u00a320. After an absolutely amazing wedding and reception, we headed back to the hotel at about midnight. My husband (!!) and I went up to our room to find that our key card wasn't working. Again. Third time that day. Perfect. We actually got off lightly. The hotel gave us a new key card and we got into our room. Little did we know that two of our guests had to sit in reception for almost an hour, as the hotel did not have their room ready. At midnight. Despite the fact that they had booked the room a month in advance. They were eventually upgraded to a suite - they headed up to the 12th floor at about 1am, only to find that, when they tried to get into the room, the key card didn't work. You've probably spotted a theme emerging. The next morning, we were woken at 8.50 by housekeeping banging repeatedly on the door. Lovely start to our first day as a married couple. I complained to the Duty Manager and had some of the room service charges removed from my guests' bills. This did basically nothing to compensate me for the fact that the majority of my guests had complained about either the standard of service, the room facilities, the systems, the breakfast, the staff's attitude, the hotel in general, the queues... and on and on and on. I was mortified at the fact that people had paid for a stay that was, at best, OK and, at worst, shockingly bad. With all the beautiful hotels in London - most of which actually seem to care about guests and customer service levels - I can only hope that the AA re-visit the Grange City and actually see it for what it is - a hotel that is simply not delivering and does not deserve the rating it currently has. At the moment, 3 stars would probably be too generous.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, Norfolk", "Title": "\u201cA damn good freebie!!\u201d", "Author": "SticksV", "ReviewID": "UR11029571", "Content": "I have just returned from a free night's stay at the Grange Hotel paid for by my fellow traveller's work. From our arrival to our departure I could not find any real fault with the hotel and I most definately found a lot which is to its merit! The bed....oh the bed ZZZZZzzzzzzZZZZzzzzz!!! We stayed in a twin room on the 7th floor and both of the beds were double in size, which was a real luxury. The duvets and pillows were absolutely sumptuous- filled with feathers and despite my fellow traveller having an allergy to to feather duvets they did not affect her in any way- so they must have been of good quality and they most certainly felt it. The bed itself was more than comfortable, I realy struggled to get up in the morning because I was so cozy and snug. Location and Noise/ Light Pollution. The curtains completely blackout the windows there's no chance of any light pollution creeping through. The hotel is located very close to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. Although we didnt get views of this the tower as I had hoped we might, the view from our room was not un-pleasant. Generally we could see other buildings and other parts of the hotel. The hotel is located VERY close to a tube station, the line ran beneath our window- our initial impression was 'oh great'! But in actual fact I can't remember hearing a single train the whole time we stayed and certainly it did not wake us in the night as we were expectng it might. The Room/ En-Suite. Our room was found in a good clean condition, the decor was tasteful and although it was not 'modern' in its style and probably not how I would decorate my own bedroom, but still it was NOT tired looking, and there were no signs of cracks/ peeling wall paper etc. The facilities in our room were everything that you would expect of a 5* hotel- including tyes a hair-dryer ladies which worked very well and also a very expensive mini-bar featuring a Kit-Kat chunky breaking the bank at \u00c2\u00a32.25!!! Might I add we didn't even open the door after having read the price list in our welcome pack. The bathroom was gorgeous, very nicely decorated and I loved the glass doors over the bath which you could close when you showered- but be warned when leaving the shower, both my fellow traveller and I very nearly slipped when we trod on the bath mat, as the floor is very slippery even when dry- take caution if walking in there with socks on too!! There's plenty of hot water, no problems there and all facilities worked well. Although we were a bit stumped on how to get the plug out the bath once you had put it in. It wasn't a plug on a chain, it just slotted in and had nothing to grip to pull it out (we forced it out with a pair of tweezers in the end)... there probably is a 'proper' way of getting it out but between us we couldn't find a lever/ button/ knob/ handle anywhere that operated it. Staff, Service and Breakfast. The hotel has a very formal feel and the staff that we met were all very polite, friendly and helpful, but also very professional and performed their jobs very well. They seem to be very good at anticipating your needs... e.g. when we came down to check out we were offered luggage storage and while they were organising this they took note of whether we would need any transport on our return later in the day (which we did). When we arrived later in the day, we collected our bags and as we returned back to main reception, they had already flagged a cab down for us, without having to ask them. The level of service was very consistent and worked well overall. Breakfast had all that you would expect of a 5* hotel, smoked salmon, various cheeses, pastries, fresh yogurt (in cute little jars), cereals, dried fruits, baked breads/ rolls and jams, cooked eggs, sausages, beans, tomatoes, hash browns, mushrooms, fresh fruits (melon of various varieties, strawberries and pinapple). Most importantly, the scrambled egg was not the usual rubbery or crumbly dry stuff you often get, it was very fresh and soft and moist, I was quite impressed. So all in all I would most definately recommend this hotel based on our experience and hope that this review helps you picking your place to stay!", "Date": "November 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful room and pool, servuce not up to par\u201d", "Author": "AThena53", "ReviewID": "UR10982266", "Content": "This is a beautiful hotel in a great location if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing business in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the City\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd- the 1-mile square financial district in London near the Tower. The hotel is an easy walk from the Tower Hill Tube station and Fenchurch rail station. My room was huge by the standards of any hotel in a big city, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a courtyard with a segment of the original Roman wall around London. One shortcoming was that there were no sheer curtains for the windows. The facing building was an office but I still felt exposed with the curtains open and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy the nice view with the curtains closed. The bathroom was also tiny by comparison with the room. The 25-meter swimming pool lived up to the standards of the room- generously-sized, and so nice that I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to end my morning swim and go to work! One morning there were a total of 6 of us swimming laps and we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t running into each other. Unfortunately, the services were not at the same levcel as the quality of the property or the steep room rates ($400/night including VAT- with Internet connection extra, of course). My experience got off to an unfortunate start when I checked in after arriving on the morning redeye from Chicago and then putting in a full day at the office. My room key didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. I really did NOT feel like traipsing down to get a new one, but I did and they cut me a new key. Twenty-four hours later, that one didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and I had to repeat the process. On my last day, I took a swim before checking out, went back to my room, and- you guessed it- had to pad barefoot into the lobby at 7:15 AM, dressed only in a T-shirt over my wet swimsuit and get yet another key. I called Room Service the first night to order dinner; the phone rang and rang and then I got disconnected. Inexplicably, the next time I called someone answered immediately. (The dinner did arrive within the promised time and at the correct temperature, both nights that I used them.) Shortly after checking in I tried calling my husband using a calling card and a toll-free access number and was puzzled when I kept getting connected to the hotel operator after a few digits. I explained that I was trying to place an outside call and she said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd my phone line. After that it worked. But since when do hotel guests have to call and request that they be able to make outside phone calls? Answering the phone is not a high priority here. My call to the front desk (I wanted to request a wake-up call) rang multiple times and then was rolled over to toll-free reservations line. They were as puzzled as I was as to why they ended up with the call. The next night I dialed O to get the hotel operator to ask about charges for calling toll-free numbers. (I tried selecting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153View Bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd function from the TV after making an 800 call but got a message that this option wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available.) The call rolled over to Reception. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. They tried to connect my call to the Operator. It rang, and rang and was eventually rolled over to the same person at reception. They connected me to someone who took my number and said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find out and call me back. They never did. I read the material in my room more closely and finally found the answer- a connection charge of 1 GBP. Fine, but why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the employees know that? I got along quite well at the Grange for the next few days by assuming that service would be on a par with Hampton Inns. Well, I may be insulting Hampton Inns. At least most Hamptons have front desk staff ready to serve. The night before I left I wanted to find out the cost of a taxi to Paddington Station so I could make sure I had enough cash. I waited in line forever behind a guy who was having a very complicated checkout and finally asked the nice lady at the desk. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to ask the Concierge, she said, who would also have to book it for me. The concierge, of course, had his own waiting line and I turned on my heel and left. I knew there were plenty of cabs waiting outside the hotel in the morning and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just ask one. Just for fun, I asked the doorman as I was leaving that morning. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, either. I loved the pool at the Grange and the convenient location, but I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be back.

HOWEVER: - the vast majority of the staff do not speak English as a first language, so expect to have to repeat or explain yourself; - the girl who took my wife's order for a liquer coffee in the bar did not know what this was, and after conveying the order to the barman, came back with a coffee in a cup and a side-order of the liquer! - the breakfast staff did not have us down for having breakfast included in our tariff, to which we had to show them our bokoing confirmation; - \"buffet breakfast\" is a cold, continental breakfast, and there is an \u00c2\u00a38 surcharge per person for a hot english-breakfast; - the morning room-service takes away bathroom flannels, and these are, according to hotel staff, only replaced by an evening room service, so you do not have any face or hand flannels during the day; - room service did not empty our bins at all; - the lobby staff were verbally fighting with a taxi-driver on the saturday, using swear-words, gestures and threats of violence, in front of our children. We left this all on the feedback forms, but when mentioned to the receptionist on check-out she just put it down to new staff turn-over. The one ray of hope in all this was Royce, the restaurant manager: we were assured at booking time that the breakfast was a hot buffet, but on arrival it wasn't. Royce tried helping to clear up the situation, and in the end compromised on payment for the breakfast.", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cGood - Overall\u201d", "Author": "LuLuMac", "ReviewID": "UR8368895", "Content": "First impression was excellent - the receptionist who checked me in was lovely.

In the end the reservations manager offered an upgrade to a Tower view executive room, with full English breakfast (priced in the hotel at \u00c2\u00a320 pp!) rather than the inclusive Continental, and a bottle of wine upon arrival. I agreed to move to the City hotel and I wasn't disappointed. I'd arranged the weekend as a special treat for my mum to do lunch at the Savoy and the wine tour at Vinopolis. From start to finish I couldn't have asked for more. The reception staff were fantastic and clearly had special instructions confirming what the Holborn had offered us in return for agreeing to move. Our room was ready at 12 with the wine brought up shortly after our arrival. We stayed on the 8th floor in room 820 with an amazing view of the Tower as promised. The room was clean, quiet and luxurious with 2 double beds - I had one of the best night's sleep for some time! Staff in the corridors all greeted you and were pleasant and polite. From my experience I honestly find it hard to believe that others found the staff rude and disinterested. For example I asked for an extra robe to be provided and it was with us within 5 minutes. Many people on this site seem to dislike the location but from Tower Hill tube station the West End can be reached within 20 minutes and you are so close to the bars and restaurants (including at least 4 Conran restaurants) that line the river across Tower Bridge, and a short walk from St Katherines Dock. The pool, sauna and aromatherapy steam room are fantastic and every inch of the leisure club was spotless - I can't fault it. Went down for an hour at 8.30 on the sunday morning and it was practically empty - when we were leaving the parents with kids were arriving so we definitely got there at the right time!

There was an ice machine in a cupboad along the corridor, which struck me as a bit strange, but there are minibars in the rooms so I suppose it makes sense. The room was quiet and medium-sized, with king-size bed. No duvet but rather uncomfortable sheet/blankets instead. There is a desk, but it's almost entirely occupied with TV and other gadgets, so using it for anything might prove difficult. The bath was large but a bit annoying to use: the tap control can't be reached once you're sitting in it, and if you turn it too far the shower pours down on you. One child-size bathrobe is supplied, but there were plenty of towels.

This is what they have to say: \"The Grange City Hotel is a spectacular new luxury 5 star hotel. Superbly located with unique panoramic views over the City and just a gemstone's throw away from the Tower of London the Grange City represents a first for a hotel of this standard in the City.\" Okay, now I can begin. First, a bit of background. I was booked into the Grange Holborn because of an early meeting in Southhampton Row, i.e. solely for location. I would normally stay at the Covent Garden Hotel or similar (see reviews - they are wonderful), but was concerned enough about making the meeting in an unflustered state, I chose the Grange Holborn. I have written on their section of Tripadvisor in detail about what happened when I arrived, but in brief, they had cocked up,'lost' internet bookings and didn't have a room. The solution to dispatch me in a taxi across London to their sister hotel the Grange City by the Tower of London. Swallowing the frustration of being transferred from the hotel I only chose for location to a venue at the opposite side of the City, I accepted the apologies, and believed the promise that the City Grange would give me a 'wonderful' room and look after me. Arrival at the City Grange was not the 'welcome' experience of a hotel keen to make up to a guest. An extraordinarily impatient and brusque receptionist made no eye contact, offered no help with bags and believed that a sneering swoop of the hand served as directions to the lift. A word about the foyer itself- it is brash, vulgar in its decor and, when I arrived and left the hotel, thick with stale smoke as guests appear to smoke everywhere and anywhere in the public spaces. On the way up to the room on the 11th floor, two surly members of staff completely ignored me. But to the room - after all, it was going to be 'lovely' given the problems at the Grange Holborn wasn't it? Er, no. Nasty tacky, fake wood, dark brown, dusty, small, stuffy, unclean in the corners, feeble hair dryer tethered to a drawer, UHT milk and cheap fittings. I am open mouthed at the audacity of a hotel that claims such a room as 5 star. I would be hard pushed to see it as comparable to 3 star hotels in which I have stayed. The 'spectacular luxury' claimed by the hotel certainly isn't to be found in the rooms. Perhaps the view would compensate? Looking at the Tower of London at night could lift the spirits of a frustrated traveller. And the hotel is so proud of its 'unique panoramic views' as stated on its website. On pulling the curtains, I was greeted not with the glistening Thames but the incinerators of a large office block that looked directly over my room. Certainly a 'unique' view but hardly panoramic. And then came the piece de resistance of this depressing, wretched experience - the sound of the first train thundering under my room. Yep, strangely the hotel doesn't mention that it is built directly over a railway line. And those trains are a) loud b) very regular c) finish late and d) begin very early. Dinner in the deserted, but weirdly smoke filled restaurant was unappealing, so I asked the concierge for directions to local restaurants. He was utterly uninterested and the best he could muster was a Chez Gerard, or a nasty Indian. Being in the City means there are fewer dining options, but this seemed unnecessarily uninspired. After a night accompanied by the trains, the hotel really surpassed itself in its ineptitude in the morning. There was a saga involving ordering breakfast which makes me shake my head in disbelief when I think about it several days later. Then, as I was dressing with the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door, I was interrupted by persistent banging on the door which turned out to be the window cleaner. I have rarely left a hotel with such unmitigated horror at the level of service, standard of decor, cleanliness and facilities and a sense of overwhelming feeling of being thoroughly ripped off. I got in a taxi to try to make it across London in time for the meeting that had led me to book a Grange hotel in the first place. It took 45 minutes rather than the 25 that the hotel had told me to allow and I was, as I had feared, late. A disastrous end to an utterly disastrous stay. So, in short I'd agree wholeheartedly with the hotel's promises that \"Grange City represents a first for a hotel of this standard in the City\" because there has never, in my experience of business travel, been such a desultory standard of hotel with the audacity to masquerade as 'five star' imposed on the unfortunate guests of EC1.", "Date": "October 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cpompous and arrogant , doesn't live up to their stars!\u201d", "Author": "Aeruynh", "ReviewID": "UR5894552", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Grange for 4 nights in the fourth week of july this year.

My husband and I decided it would be a good idea to stay in London overnight, rather than do a late commute home. However, this proved to be nightmare, literally, as we were shocked to be woken at 1.30am, to the shrilling sound of the fire alarm. We were completely disorientated for the first few seconds, and fortunately, the alarm soon stopped. We realised that it must have been a false alarm and then endeavoured to return to sleep. Incredibly, at 2.00am and again at 3.00am were woken by the shrill sound of the fire alarm and again these were false alarms. After the final alarm sounded at 3.00am my husband, along with some other guests, made his way to the hotel reception, having to take the stairs as the lifts were now out of action We needed to establish what was actually happening and if there was an emergency. The night porter informed him that it was a technical problem, which was being investigated, but they could not guarantee that that there would be no further alarms. The next morning it was clear that there were a lot of unhappy guests, however, we were appalled that no apology was offered. I requested to speak with the Operations Manager who informed me that the fire alarms were steam sensitive, and that some people had been taking showers, which had activated the alarm on three separate occasions. At this point we did receive a verbal apology for the inconvenience, and we were offered a room upgrade if we booked the hotel in the future.

In no way can the Grange City be described as a five-star hotel. While the rooms are acceptable in terms of their cleanliness (not counting the balcony, which boasted seven discarded cigarette butts throughout our stay) and size, they are poorly maintained and, at best, only adequately furnished. I found the bed uncomfortable, the linen extremely average (as one other reviewer puts it, with motel-style blankets) and the pillows atrocious. The poor standards at the hotel carry though to the staff. Housekeeping was infuriatingly inconsistent, frequently forgetting to replace face washers and breakfast order forms, and constantly giving us fresh towels, even though we consistently hung them (as per instructions) on the woefully inadequate towel rail to signal that we didn't want fresh ones. (So much for trying to do the right thing by the environment.) Sometimes the turn-down service turned up, sometimes it didn't, leaving us to wonder why the hotel bothered proclaiming the existence of such a service at all. I called Room Service twice during our stay. On both occasions they were very slow (a bottle of beer and some ice took 20 minutes to arrive). One night I rang to ask for a breakfast order form (the second time I'd had to do so). We were on the point of going to bed when we discovered we'd not been left one when our room was made up and had to wait half an hour (and call twice) before one of the staff attended to this simple request. The Concierge is also sub-standard (I called them three times during our stay). On the first occasion that I had to call to request a breakfast order menu, the person on duty told me to call Room Service. This would be fine at a three-star establishment, but at a five star I would expect him to take the initiative to have the forms sent up, or at the very least put me through to the correct department. On another occasion the phone rang and rang at the Concierge before it was answered... by the switchboard... who routed me back to the Concierge, where once again the phone rang for ages before it as answered.

Excellent if you want to see the Tower of London etc. But a little out of the centre of things otherwise.", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay at The Grange City\u201d", "Author": "MT40", "ReviewID": "UR3658684", "Content": "My husband booked our weekend as a surprise 10th anniversary treat. We were both pleasantly surprised with the hotel considering the modest room rate of \u00c2\u00a380. We have stayed in similar 5 star hotels and paid an awful lot more. The staff on arrival were courtious and the marbled entrance area impressive. Our room was was very nicely furnished with a 6ft bed, sofa area and marbled bathroom. Our view was not the best in the hotel, however we could see The Tower of London, Thames and some great architechture. The interior design and standard of decor was modern and of good quality. All in all no complaints. Breakfast was good, I had continental, which included, juices, fruit, cereal, rolls, pastries, yogurt, toast etc. My husband opted for the full english which he too enjoyed. We were not rushed and the atmosphere relaxed. Before our stay my husband had been concerned that we were a little too far from the action in the West End. This was not a problem as we used Cabs to get about the fare only being \u00c2\u00a38 to Covent Garden. Our stay was only two days after the London bombings so we were a little reluctant to use the Tube. We also used the river boat to get to Westminster (\u00c2\u00a313 return for two) this was an enjoyable way to get about and educational too. I would certainly stay in The Grange City again and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grange City Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d224769-Reviews-Grange_City_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$236 - $530*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8-14 Coopers Row</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">EC3N 2BD</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "224769", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b8/78/b878dab6f5e65b8891ec429aba2c9d374large.jpg"}}
