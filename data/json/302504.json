The hotel is located 15 minutes walk from MTR Tsim Sha Tsui, which was ok. Along the way to the MTR station you can find plenty of places to have your breakfast (Delifrance, Subway, Starbucks).

I have to say waking up at 4.30 am with a bit of jet lag, opening the curtains remotely and experiencing the full Hong Kong view without getting up was an excellent experience. The hotel being a Japanese chain has obviously excellent staff with very good manners. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Only qualms were that the hotel's outdoor roof pool looked a bit dodgy though in fairness it was empty, as it was the wrong time of year. The restaurant on top of the hotel has quite incredible views; though we did have to sort out our server as she was quite cheeky.

The whole process rubbed me the wrong way so i called a very apologetic on duty manager who offered to bring my up a bottle of wine for purchase.

The room is badly out of date and the smell of mildew in the carpet was instantly apparent and never faded with my stay. in-room amenities are few including packets of instant coffee which i more readily associate with a cheap motel.

Really glad with Hotel Nikko as a choice. Great value for money. We were 3 adults travelling. We were 3 and we got the Moderate Hotel room at the Nikko Floor. We got this via Expedia USA. Here's are some of the awesome positives about this hotel: 1. This hotel had top notch service. The bathroom had a stack of amenities that were regularly replaced. This included a shave, cream, toothbrush, toothpaste, and the usual hotel stuff (soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap), etc. For electronics needs such as a universal adapter, just call housekeeping/front desk and they will provide not just one but as many adapters as needed. I needed an iron w/ ironing board and got that promptly too. 2. Toilet had a Toto Washlet S300 which had an automatic back and front cleaner, with adjustable pressure and oscillator. Need I say more? 3. Free complimentary water and fruits everyday. 4. Free Internet and wifi in the room. I am not sure if this is just a Nikko Floor (Floors 10, 11 and 12) amenity. 5. Free buffet breakfast. We had two free breakfast included in our package. Good value. Had american, continental, Japanese, Chinese, juices/drinks stations. 6. Location wise, it is just a 5 minute walk to the Tsim Sha Tsui east MTR station. That station is huge though. The nearest Exit is Exit G / Entrance G near the WingOn Centre and Shangri-La Kowloon Hotel. 7. There's a complimentary shuttle every 15-20 minutes to some areas in Kowloon like the Ocean Terminal. 8. The Hotel is part of the Airport Express system. The Airport express is a train from the HK International Airport to the Airport Stations in HK Central and Kowloon. From the Kowloon Station, there is a complimentary shuttle every 15 minutes that goes to the Hotel Nikko. The depot is K3 (at the Kowloon airport express station). 9. Lots of restaurants nearby but if you want easy access to good Asian food, just walk to Chatham road which has tons of restaurants. There is a grocery store nearby too in the area in front of the Intercontinental (hotel beside Nikko). It is called International. 10. Excellent concierge service. My mom needed the schedule of masses at a nearby Catholic church. They printed out the schedule for her. 11. Very near to the harbour walkway that gives breathtaking views of the HK skyline. Check the Avenue of the Stars area. 12. We booked for December. Usually, hotels at this time of the year, especially 4 star hotels are very expensive. But Nikko was probably the least expensive among the 4 star hotels in the Tsim Sha Tsui and Central areas. A real value for money. 13. Nice flat screen TV. I think it was 40 inches. 14. Free slippers, bathrobes, and kimonos provided. 15. Lastly, as an added bonus, our room was at the Nikko floor. This gave us free access to the Nikko Executive Lounge which has a full stunning view of the HK skyline. Between 4-6 pm, we had free food as bonus. Free food includes free beer (I saw 8 different types including Foster, Guinness, Tsing Tao, San Miguel, Sapporo, etc.). There's free juices, coffee, and tea. Free Haagen Dazs ice cream. Cookies, breads...really depends on the day. New Years' eve day was awesome though - - they had canapes, champagne, wine, hard liquors, lobster, dim sum, etc. A few negatives: 1. So-so lobby. 2. Rooms were a little small. Because the hotel was fully booked, they had no additional extra beds to give out (all taken). We needed an extra bed because we were 3. We thought of upgrading but they said their biggest room will not be able to accommodate an extra bed unless the couch was taken out (these are for rooms with 2 twin beds . . .I believe they call those twin beds a \"queen\"). With a little creative tinkering, I was able to make the couch into a bed (connect the couch and the footstool to one of the beds and stack them with 4-5 pillows to make a bed. Just ask housekeeping for extra pillows). Overall: 5 stars. Can't beat the value and location for the price . . .especially during the extremely expensive holiday season.

The room was great with a very comfortable bed but I found the pillows too soft for my liking. The bathroom had a bathtub and separate shower cubicle with the necessary toiletries and lots of towels. Service staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgable of the area when we asked where we could get some shopping done. Cafe Serena also had a good intercontinental breakfast buffet with a wide selection of dishes to choose from. What I liked most about the hotel is its attempt to be more environmentally-friendly. Guests can choose when to change their bedsheets or towels using a simple system the hotel has devised. I applaud them for their efforts. However, if you wanted Wi-FI you had to pay for it. Though I find that this is the norm nowadays, I still wish hotels would offer free Wi-Fi to their guests. After all, we're already paying so much for the room. Even a small hotel in Batam, Indonesia manages to provide this service so I don't see why a well-known hotel like Nikko cannot. Luckily, I could get free Wi-Fi at the conference venue and down the road at Starbucks so I didn't have to shell out any money.

As there were four of us travelling and we arrived in Hong Kong late at night I would strongly recommend others in similar circumstances to take advatage of this service. There is a fee charged but it was certainly worth it for the great service we received. I have read other reports on the location of the hotel with some saying it is a bit far away from key areas in Hong Kong. There is no doubt that is a ten to fifteen minute walk to the Star Ferry terminal if you are wanting to go to Hong Kong Island or about the same distance to the main shopping areas, but we found the walks very pleasant with lots to see on the way so this in my view is not an issue when that is balanced with the great hotel, service, view and great value when you book the Nikko room.

Boxes, barrels, bins - Lord knows what else. Maybe it was just a noisy massage? My Wife tried to make a coffee and there wasn't any, just powdered Creamer, so I called the Concierge. No Answer. Called Housekeeping. No answer. Called the Front Desk and after several rings got through ~ \"it's in the tray next to the kettle\". No it isn't, that;s the problem. We'll send some up. 20 minutes waiting and I decided to go down to Reception to collect some - there were 6 bellhops, concierge's and a Meet & Greet lady milling around with nothing to do, so I asked to speak to a Manager. Why? Because I would like to make a complaint. Why? She eventually went off to get a Manager and after 15 minutes I gave up waiting and went outside for a coffee. When I returned I went to the Nikko Lounge (also on the 14th floor) and I asked to see the Manager, who duly arrived, and confirmed that he had just taken some Coffee Creamer to \"the woman\" in my room. I hastily confirmed that she was not a freelance masseuse, but my wife, and that what we were actually looking for was some coffee, not more powderd Creamer. He apologised and went and got some Nescafe. I mentioned the noisy lifts and he opened the door and showed me, as if to prove the point that I wasn't imagining it. I also mentioned the delays in communication and in contacting him and he confirmed that he had been busy - which is reasonable enough, but there was no offer of a comp breakfast, real coffee on the house, or any indication why the \"upgrade\" 14th floor features wall-to-wall hookers and service lifts. At check-out the handed us a bill in my wife's name, addressed as \"Mr.\" and initially declined to accept my HSBC debit card. I then discovered that they had played the same trick on my wife the previous evening, and were holding a RMB 2,400 cash deposit taken from her the evening before - against a pre-guaranteed & non-cancellable room rate just over half that amount. The ethnically Asian checkout girl insisted on speaking only Chinese and only to my (Chinese) wife, and then declared that she wasn't able to give us a tag receipt for our baggage (which we wished to leave with the Concierge) because they had run out.

We were given a corner room which had a semi view of harbour and sceince museum on the other side - quite good. Bed felt a little on hard side at first but in spite of that we sttill had very conmfortable sleeps, so no problem there. The service in the Executive Lounge was excellent right from check-in to check-out and I'd just like to mention Janis Lau who was a lovely friendly receptionist and also the 2 young girls (morning and evening shift) who served the drinks and tea - they were very good but I didn't catch their names - thanks for looking after us. Its well worth it to upgrade as their is drinks available all day - quality beers and tea/coffee as well as Ice Cream and biscuits and chocs. At 6pm they serve Dim Sum and any choice of drinks till 9pm - very good value and the food was lovely. Breakfast is also served there in the morning. The lounge is not large so you do need to arrive early if you want a seat. I have no complaints about the Nikko - the door staff who looked after the cases were friendly, as was the guy outside who'd worked there for 30 years. If I had to be picky I would say the Concierge could have been friendlier, but as in lots of big hotels Concierges only seem interested if they are getting tips!

This was our 5th holiday in HK and, unfortunately, the Kowloon Shangri-La where we stayed on our last two visits had priced itself out of our range for this trip, so we had to look for a cheaper alternative. We got a great deal at the Nikko, just up the road, with harbour view rooms on the Nikko floor - which included full daily breakfast, all-day snacks with beer and soft drinks and very generously proportioned alcoholic drinks and dim sum in the evenings. The room price also included free wi-fi, a 10% discount at all the hotel\u2019s bars and restaurants and separate check-in/check out facilities in the Nikko lounge to save queuing in reception. All this for HK$2,150 per night for 27-29/12 and HK$2,600 for 30/12-2/1 (about \u00a3173 / \u00a3210 currently), which was less than the price of a standard room-only at the Shangri-La. We were very pleasantly surprised by the standard of the hotel and although the rooms were a little smaller and the views not quite as spectacular as the Shangri-La\u2019s, we though it was excellent value for money. It took an extra couple of minutes to walk to the Star Ferry pier and the MTR station, but hey, we were on holiday, so what\u2019s the rush? There are loads of restaurants in the Tsim Sha Tsui area, but if you don't want to walk too far there's a wonderful Szechuan restaurant (called Sze Chue Wan I think!) in the South Seas shopping mall directly opposite the front of the hotel.

We were just there for the one night on a visa run for the Children, as the Chinese visa in HK is far easier, cheaper and more fun! The best part of our stay was the rate. Our friend secured it for $700 HKD, but get this, the agency web site we used OPENLY states that Caucasian & Japanese customers pay and extra $300 HKD. I thought this to be highly discriminatory, and there is no way they would pursue this extra charge because I was white and not Asian. Alas, I was wrong, on check out they asked for my Chinese passport, as I had used my Western one to check-in. The duty manager explained to me that the rate I was quoted was a special \"promotion\" for Chinese guests...yeah right...anyway I produced my Chinese drivers license and said my Chinese passport was at the UK embassy getting a visa...problem solved. So the Caucasian paid the Asian rate...I had heard of this practice before but have never had such a blatant experience of it. As others have observed the carpets are really showing their age, the food is very middle of the road, and the 5* prices charged for room service, F&B and 'extras' are eye-popping. On the plus side it is very close to the train to mainland China, and a free shuttle to the Star Ferry.

Staff friendly and typically wanted to go out of their way to help. We booked the hotel on hotels.com and got a reasonable rate. Upon check in we were ushered to the 14th floor where there was a \"special offer\" waiting for us. On the 14th floor is the \"Executive Lounge\" with free drinks galore and a fantastic view of the harbour. There is a check in desk in the lounge. The staff there offered us the chance to upgrade for an additional 550HKD per night (inc taxes) which in the end we decided to go for. This extra cost bought us a room on the Nikko floor, with a great view of the harbour, access to the executive lounge, breakfast, wifi etc. We're pleased we paid for the upgrade. Examples of good service include - staff always responsive when we called for extra hangers, water, towels. - On our final day our flight wasn't until midnight. However the staff let us use the shower and stay in the lounge until we left which was great. Tell us how you liked the room Room (1518) on the Nikko floor was nice and big with a huge bed. Lots of space in the room. Bathroom also huge - looked a bit dated but was clean with a good shower and nice toiletries. Liked the fact that that there was free water every day in the hotel. Loved the view of the harbour from the room. Talk about the location & amenities About a five minute walk from Tsim Sha Tsui MTR. Located near the Intercontinental/ShangriLa etc - all had nice bars/restaurants. View of the harbour from the hotel - can't quite see the Bank of China or IFC buildings though so can't see the light show at night. Wasn't a problem for us but depends on how desperate you are to have that view from your hotel! Amenities included a swimming pool on the top floor. From the top floor you have a view over the whole harbour. Pool was great and we went there every day. Shame it shuts at 7pm though which means you can't see the light show from the top. Say what you liked best & least Liked best- Executive lounge (cocktails and canapes from 7-9pm), beer and soft drinks there for the rest of the time, free wireless (in exec lounge and Nikko floor), friendly helpful staff, pool, view of harbour. Liked least - nothing really. With the price of the exec lounge it wasn't really that cheap though (approx 175 GBP per night).", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cvery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "val_destination", "ReviewID": "UR39964937", "Content": "I stayed here for one night in September 2008.

I arrived at the Hotel Nikko a day after my check-in date. Check-in was a snap (granted it was midnight). The check-in staff made a copy of my boarding pass and airline letter. I asked the front desk clerk if I am going to be charged for the night I missed. He told me the reservation manager will review the documents and then contact me later on the day. I agreed. Hotel location: Hotel Nikko is located at the far east end of Mody Road. It is a bit secluded/quiet but it is within walking distance to Nathan Road, the MTR, Starbucks, Inexpensive rest. and the Kowloon harbor. I booked the lowest rate possible (an excellent deal on-line) and still got a huge room on the 10th floor. See downloaded photo. The tv in the room was a bit small but the room was very comfortable (no loud air-conditioner or strange smell). The room has a small fridge, 2 free bottles of water given daily and a fruit basket - refilled by the maid daily. I loved the bathroom (it has a walk-in shower and a deep soaking tub). All the hotel service staff I encountered were very nice. At check-in, I did not upgrade my room nor was I asked by the check-in staff if I wanted an upgrade. I did use the business center on the 14th floor once ($40 HKD for 15 minutes). After a full day of running around the city, I returned in the afternoon and received a message from the reservation manager. I went to the front desk and inquired about my request on file. The front desk staff member checked and then said my request was denied. I told him that was unacceptable because I called the hotel ahead of time. In any rate, he connected me by phone with the reservation manager. The reservation manager repeated to me 3-times that it was due to personal circumstances that I arrived late to the hotel therefore I would be charged for the night I missed. I persisted with her over the phone for like 5 minutes before she agreed to view the travel voucher I received from the airline. To make the long story short, I never received a formal response from the reservation manager but when I checked out the next day, I was not charged for the night I missed at the hotel. The check-out staff told me that I might still be charged for the night I missed and my request was still pending. O well. Overall, I enjoyed my relaxing stay at the Hotel Nikko. I would stay there again but I would make sure I have everything clearly documented. I won't expect too much from the reservation/front desk staff.", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201ctoo modern by half!\u201d", "Author": "rosstucker", "ReviewID": "UR6831959", "Content": "Just like Hong Kong itself, this hotel is a bit of \" the modern\" mixed in with some frustrating details.

The personal touch was exemplified by the dining room on Christmas day: when we expressed some doubt about eating lobster, crab, and so on; they rushed around and got us turkey, cranberries, dressing, etc. This was while the dining room was overwhelmed with customers! Unbelievable service! What more could one ask? On the other hand, the hotel seems to want to offer individual guests all kinds of deals -- and one is escorted to the fourteenth floor to hear about \"special offers\" when all one wants is to go to one's room. The room seems to be overwhelmed with technology -- requiring virtually an engineering degree to figure out things like light switches, draperies, and so on.

Your return ticket includes fast train to Kowloon station, and minibus transfer to the Nikko. Totally painless. After checking out , the minibus takes you back to the station where you can chek in for your flight, say good bye to your hold luggage, and make the most of your last day. Don't forget to visit Lamma island for a fantastic fish and seafood meal at the Rainbow restaurant. They will take you both ways in their private ferry at no extra cost. The hotel will book it all for you. Buy an Octopus card, which is valid on the very efficient public transport.

Also included were buffet breakfast in the 1st floor dining room (or a much lighter continental breakfast in the afore mentioned lounge), free wireless internet access in both the room and lounge, free access to the health club and to the pool on the roof (which is spectacular) and discounts on laundry, room service and purchases within the hotel. At $HK1550 a night, this package was a great deal and worth every penny. The service was without fault very efficient and instant and the quality of the food at breakfast superior and quite varied. I in fact tried several of the other restaurants within the hotel and all were outstanding (especially Toh Lee for Cantonese cuisine). The room and bathroom amenities were excellent with bathrobes and slippers, a plasma TV screen, cable TV with many channels, a mini bar fridge that could accommodate extra stuff if you wanted, complimentary water, tea and coffee ingredients, an electric kettle, a safe, electronic window drapes, a large bathroom with separate shower stall and bathtub. There wasn\u2019t anything that I could thinks of that I missed. Room service was excellent and very quick. The only minor criticism I have would be that the concierge service was not reliable. I asked for a good restaurant and was told to go to the Jumbo Restaurant off the shore in Aberdeen. The place is inexplicably a tourist must-see where one pays thrice the money for a meal of comparable quality anywhere else. On another occasion I asked how much approximately a taxi would cost to a certain place and was completely misinformed. Other than that, I would not hesitate to recommend the Nikko, provided you go on the all-inclusive package. Believe me, it saves you a lot of money if you use it well. The Nikko is within walking distance of the Ferry Terminal and of great shopping on Nathan Road, The Jade and Night Markets. Restaurants abound in the area and if one wishes excellent non-asian cuisine, go to the Knutsford Terrace off Nathan Road.

Booked a room at Nikko Hotel in Hong Kong in Dec 2005 through Orbitz at a fantastic rate. Confirmed twice with Orbitz the reservation was firm before I left US. Upon arrival on the 23rd of Dec., Nikko Hotel claimed no such reservation was on file and flatly denied us a room even after I showed my paper confirmation. The manager there Mr. Park curtly said \"We can't be responsible for online reservations made on other websites and what's more I have never heard of Orbitz\". Given it was Christmas time, I thought he was very unsympathetic because he made no accommodation to the stressful situation. The desk receptionist confirmed there were rooms available but the manager would only let us have the room for about twice the price that we paid for at Orbitz. After 45-minutes with him, we gave up. He treated us as if we were trying to 'cheat' the hotel and we felt hurt. I would imagine a five-star Japanese hotel would be more understanding and willing to make adjustment and work with 'stranded' customers. Later I wrote to the hotel headquarters in Tokyo providing the details. The customer service department clearly did not read the letter; they provided a generic apology for the inconvenience and claimed the hotel was full at that time and there wasn't much that could be done. I would not recommend this hotel at all because of the attitude displayed by the manager. If this were a 1 or 2 star-small hotel, I can understand.
