The shuttle bus service is extremely limited and only goes a couple of times a day. It is also a substantial distance from the nearest Metro and getting a taxi back is extremely expensive as is using the shuttle for a week. There is no possibility of spending the evening in Rome if you want to get the shuttle bus back. If you want to use the shuttle bus to go to the supermarket it goes in the middle of the day meaning that you can do nothing else. Furnishings are basic and not what I would expect from Club la Costa accommodation. The knives were useless and it took several requests to get a replacement with one receptionist being extremely unhelpful. The range of utensils are also very limited. The couple running the cafe are lovely but the opening hours are limited and they close completely one day. The cafe is the only place on site offering some basic food provisions. We had checked before we went and were told that CLC members should not be charged the mandatory charge of 35 Euros per person for use of the pool etc - but the hotel tried to charge us anyway. I was extremely disappointed with this hotel and did not think it lived up to CLC standards. There is nothing to do in the evenings so children will be totally bored. I would expect CLC to do better.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOh ye of little faith\u201d", "Author": "Peter A", "ReviewID": "UR118876982", "Content": "We had the pleasure of spending two glorious weeks at this fabulous resort.

She and Mara, the other receptionist, were a pleasure to deal with, enabling us to enjoy our holiday to the full. Departure was also made very simple. We had hired a car for the full two weeks and both Maya and Mara gave us excellent suggestions on where to visit out of Rome. The resort runs a shuttle bus to Rebibbia, the last stop on the Metro and apart from weekend and our first day we chose to use this form of transport. For just 3 euros a day, each way, you enjoy a stress free gateway to Rome. Try the hop on hop off bus for a day in Rome it is great to orientate yourself and runs rugularly with a headphone commentary. Your ticket includes the Metro and ATAC buses for the day, so excellent value. The cafe/restaurant is excellently run by Michela and Enzo who provided nutritious, varied and enjoyable meals for a good value price, on the evenings we did not wish to leave the site, and their Cappuchino was to die for. The indoor swimming pool is large and beautifully cared for. At the same location is a sauna, steam room and beauty treatments and the gym, while small, has all the exercise equipment and weights you could ask for.

Tip one is to put the Simone Golf Club as the destination as sat navs found this and the resort entrance is right next door. We were early to book in and had no problem getting access to our apartment no 210 which overlooked the golf course. The apartment and the resort in general were very clean and tidy, but all a bit tired looking. A coat of paint would improve it straight away. The bed was comfortable and the Jacuzzi bath and air conditioning was very welcomed. The kitchen was fine with a full oven, microwave and a dishwasher. There were several English news and an English film channel on the 2 flat screen TV\u2019s. The underground car park was really useful as the weather was very warm. There was also a small laundry room in the basement. The little onsite bar/restaurant was fine for a quick meal and all the food was very good value. It also stocked basic foods. The local supermarket was only a 10 min drive and here you could get everything. We ate in the golf club for Sunday lunch, which was an easy but very warm 15 min stroll. The meal was a set one course choice costing 12.50\u20ac and was very good. Most other nights we ate in the site restaurant. The indoor swimming pool was a decent size for a proper swim, with Jacuzzi jets along one side. The sauna and steam room looked very nice but I didn't try them, but all were spotless clean, as was the whole resort. Although we had a car we used the shuttle service into Rome very good value at 6\u20ac return. We did drive to Tivoli, Asoli and Frascati, all only a short drive and worth visiting. The only organised tour we took was Rome at night, definitely a different view of many of the major sites. The only downside was the young guide was not very informative and the coach driver got lost returning to the resort at well past midnight. We only stayed 5 nights which was enough for visiting Rome. The resort is fine and the bad reviews are in my opinion totally uncalled for. The staff are more than helpful, they would arrange free taxis to the local restaurants and nothing was too much trouble. Although it is a bit out of the way it is an excellent base for visiting Rome and other local areas.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIts ok as a base to explore Italy\u201d", "Author": "72traveller72", "ReviewID": "UR117689566", "Content": "After reading all the reviews, I wasn't expecting too much from the place. Having said that, we found the staff to be very good & helpful. The accommodation was disappointing though. Very small, not enough light & all the things we had come to expect of Club la Costa weren't here. Make sure you pack a small dvd player if bringing children as there wasn't one for the evenings. Plug adaptors a must & would recommend a plug in bug zapper as the mosquitos were everywhere (although we couldn't really blame carpediem for that) we later learnt that constant air con would stop them coming in. They do not provide dishwasher tablets (as I was used to) or cleaning cloths, products etc & worst of all was that there was no washing machine & we were a family of 5. You have to use the 1 washing machine in the basement/garage area which costs 5Euros per wash & the same for drying! The kitchen is not very well stocked but has bare basics which I discovered when attempting to make lasagne & couldn't because there wasn't any tray to cook it in! The plinth at base of kitchen cupboards kept falling off aswell which was annoying. We were expecting to have to pay a lot for the indoor pool but after our son was almost blinded by the strength of the chlorine in water & all our swimming costumes were bleached, they didn't charge us. I think the machine that regulated it wasn't working properly, which they hadn't been aware of. After a few days of settling in though we just got on with it & spent most of our time exploring Rome & other parts of Italy which was fantastic so it was a good base but you have to get a car! They provide a shuttle service to the metro but it I think it would limit you as you couldn't stay out in Rome in the evening & there is so much more to see throughout Italy.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Idaho Falls, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cGettin to Rome\u201d", "Author": "Beth S", "ReviewID": "UR116860690", "Content": "On our trip to Rome we stayed at the Carpediem Roma Gulf Club, and as suggested by our reservation agent and fellow trip advisor reviewers we rented a car at the airport which made everything so much easier, so if you go you have to follow this advice.

The hotel is outside the city in a beautiful place, it is clean and the staff is friendly, they do have a different schedule than we have in the States. Back home everywhere you go people are in fast motion, and we have come to expect things quickly and service at all hours, so when we travel we expect schedules to run at our convenience and not at the place we are visiting rhythm.

The furniture as we are Club La Costa members was supposed to be updated every 4 years, not the case. As for some of the pots in the room really if you cooked in them it is a life hazard - they are that bad. Especially the frying pan, it was rusty and horrible. The bed is like a rock, really takes a hard mattress to the next level. Swimming pool closed on a Saturday and closed hours during the day, there is nothing else for you to do. The Actual place is located within a housing estate and the Hotel is just a really small part of it. The building is in dire need of a paint job and if you do not have transportation there is no where to walk to you have to rely on the hotel shuttle. Although the room is kept clean it really is very old and not what I am used to. There is a restaurant not much availble if you are a vegetarian. Why they say Golf Club - this is a totally separate establishment and nothing to do with the Carpedium and it is really expensive. If you have allergies and have very sensitive skin do not stay here, I reacted to something in the room and it really was not nice, I was ill for the whole week, they do not have a doctor on site or any other medical backup. The rooms are really small and very dusty, there is no washing facility. There is a washing machine located in the garage and you will need 10 Euros to get the washing done. The TV was - well not really worth watching - had it not been for our hired car and my illness it really is a very boring place. There is nothing to do and Rome is a fair distance away. If you do go here than ask for a room facing the Golf course, that is really pretty, nothing on the otherside, well nothing attractive worth looking at. The only saving grace for this place in my opinion was the reception staff, they were really friendly and lovely, always ready to help. If you like a really quite holiday than this is a great location. Other than that I would not recommend or ask anyone to go here, I cannot believe that Club La Costa had this as one of their locations available to their members. Don't join Club La Costa that is my other advice to you - worst mistake I have ever made and such a waste of money.

In their brochure it says that it is 10kms from the centre of Rome. What a joke!! To get to Rome each day you need to get a shuttle, which runs at 9.30 am or 1 p.m. It then takes half an hour on the shuttle to reach the outskirts of Rome. You then need to get the metro and it is about 8 stops to get to Rome Terminal (I should remember exactly how many stops having had to do this every day!!!) You, therefore, don't arrive in Rome until 10.30 -10.45 a.m. It costs 6e return per person per day and the metro is 16e per person for the week. Therefore, it costs over 100e for a couple just to get to and from Rome for the week (Sunday to Friday). The shuttle then returns at 2 p.m. or 7 p.m., which means that wherever you are in Rome that at about 6 p.m. you have to start thinking about making your way back, because you still have to get the metro back to Rebbibia for the shuttle!!!! My husband nicknamed it the prison, because once back at the resort there was absolutely nothing you could do, apart from go to the little cafe/bar (to call it a restaurant, would be giving it far too much praise). The alternative was a restaurant nearby that came to pick you up by taxi. The golf cub shut at 4 p.m., so that wasn't even an option. There was no shop (the cafe sold about 10 items), so we asked where the nearest supermarket was. When we said we were going to walk there she advised us not to, because it was 2 km away and the way there was on un made roads. The shuttle did not run on Saturday and would have cost us 20e a couple, just to go and get our shopping!!!! So we walked it and we did take our lives into our own hands and it was more like 4 kms away!!!!! There was no welcome tea or coffee, which considering there was no shop was poor show!! The cafe/bar, which I will say was run by three very nice local Italians, was only meant to stay open until 10 p.m. One night I must admit we persuaded them to stay open later, but in the end they started turning the lights off around us. They also shut on a Monday night, so then there is absolutely nowhere on site to go, so we had crisps and peanuts in our room, playing cards!!! If you decided to get a taxi, because you wanted to stay in Rome for the evening, they charged 30e, but that was still only from the metro not the centre. One night we decided to do that and arranged to share with another couple, but even then it goes up to 40e when there are 4 of you. They get you at every turn!!! There is absolutely nothing near the resort it is literally in the middle of nowhere, so no nice walks etc. We didn't use the pool, because it is not open on Saturdays and Sundays, doesn't open till 10 a.m., so obviously the rest of the time, we were in Rome.

The room was fine, had a full kitchen and the jet tubs in the bathroom were a treat. I was happy to find that in-room wireless internet service was available.

The resort offered a reasonably sized apartment, with a balcony, effective air conditioning and free underground parking. As a base for visiting Rome (if you have a car) it was fine. What was UNACCEPTABLE was their tendency to attempt to CHARGE for everything else. 1) Upon arrival we were faced with a MANDATORY 35EUR per person charge for their \"Club Card\". We were told by RCI that there would be a mandatory 25EUR per person charge but by the time we arrived at the resort this had been increased by 40% to 35EUR per person. When challenged we were effectively told \"tough, RCI should have told you\". During the subsequent \"Welcome Briefing\" we were told about normal charges for various additional services and then the special \"discounted charges\" for \"Club Card\" holders. Personally I can't see how the resort owners could make references to normal charges which by definition you couldn't access when you'd already been forced to pay for a mandatory Club card? 2) One benefit of the \"Club Card\" was access to the resorts small swimming pool and gym. All of the equipment in the tiny gym was old, unstable, dirty and broken. The single treadmill stopped every two minutes, the single bike didn't work, the single stepper didn't work. The pool was fine but to use it you had to purchase a swimming cap for 1EUR (which was fine but annoying - why not issue one cap to each guest and charge for replacements). If you require access to a larger pool there is one at the \"golf club\" which you can access for a mere 35EUR per person per visit ! 3) There is slow internet access available at a discounted \"Club Card\" fee of around 3EUR per hour or 10EUR for four hours. 4) The mattress on the main bed was so hard that in the end we ended up sleeping on the sofa bed in the lounge. You've guessed it, that was so soft that you could feel the support structure underneath. We've never had issues with beds at any hotel or resort before now, so this was a real pain - literally. 5) Finally, there is no proper restraunt at the resort - just a cafe - where you need to settle your bill directly prior to your final checkout. 6) We were lucky as we had our own car, which meant that we could travel out to restraunts and the supermarket etc. The nearest tram stop is 8 KM away (about 30 minutes during rush hour).

This is an excellent way to get into Rome and is quick if not busy when you get nearer to the main Termini. We brought a 7 day ticket which gives you access to all public transport. This was not the best solution for us in the end so be aware of what you are doing before you spend the money on the tickets. 75 minutes one way 1euro, all ticket on any line 4euros, 3 days on any line 11euros. We had 2 weeks to take in the sites s spread the time out over the days. We had two guided tours one of the Vatican museum, Sistine Chapel and St.Peters Basilica and the Colosseum, Palantine Hills and Romam Forum. Both wher 3 hours long and good value. I used Viator to book them weeks before we went. Be aware it involves a lot of walking over the 3 hours. We used the hop on hop off tours to see the best bits of room but walking is the best way to see the real Rome. We went outside of Rome and travelled to Pisa (3.5hrs) and Sorrento (3hrs). sed the toll roads for this which cost 12euros one way. Be aware that when you enter the toll you take a ticket and the barrier will rise and when you come of the toll you will be charged for the milage you have drove. The smaller tolls are a set charge of 70 cents. We went to the large Lake Bracciano outside Rome,beach of Lido dei Pini (head for Anzio). Went to Tivilo a town in the hills plus Frascati which has a veiw of Rome and an excellent sunset. Note: If you are driving to the resort fromthe airport use the A90 to exit 13 onto the SS5. This will take you to a sign for Guidonia which leads to a roundabout take the exit for Marco Simome. It will be about 2 km down a long winding road until you come to a row of large bins and Carpediem RomaGolf Club is next right.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burnaby", "Title": "\u201cExcellent option for our group of seven\u201d", "Author": "maltyone", "ReviewID": "UR26179301", "Content": "We purchased a week off an RCI friend, alhough it was definately made out to be a bit better than we found, it definately fit the bit.. Our family of 5 (3 teenagers) and the inlaws Pro's - options for groups our size in europe are few and far between an $$ (this turned out to be approx 200 Can/night, a bargain). If you have transportation, this place is excellent. The subway is about 20 minutes away, parking is available for a euro, no issue finding spots. Grocery stores in the area are reasonable, approximately 10 minutes away too. The pool/spa were a welcome relief from the heat as was the AC in each bedroom & living areas. Staff were helpful, communication was easy. The first day everyone arrives (saturday) they have an informal gathering where they warn you about naples, give tips to see rome etc, shopping and the like. The talk is in english and italian. If you go, please don't talk during the italian bits, it bothered us as I can pick up some of it and it was rude to the locals...at this event they serve appetizers and drinks (watch it the punch has a kick...) which you should really consider partaking as everything will be closed food-wise at the conclusion of the session...They have a safe in the unit, we used it, no issues for our group, probably too many of us to bother with, but its nice to not worry about it given the dicey appearance of the metro you'll need to take to get into town - who spray paints the inside and outside of a complete train? *** Parking is free in town on Sundays, no permit is needed - don't consider it any other day of the week, I believe they will fine or tow you. The town's empty sunday except tourists so drive, it will give you a base to leave stuff during your travels. I leased a crazy tall minivan, no choice, 192 cm in height, it fit here in the underground, only one of a very few undergrounds Iwas able to get into gated compound, loosely enforced but secure never the less cons Crazy hard to find - we had a GPS with European settings and still - input the golf course, the club is immediately next door, asking for directions with English/French proved near impossible as this is off the beaten track Many people are upset with the service fee of 35 EU/ wk per adult guest, whether you use the facility or not. I was the only adult in our group who did, but 2 of our teenagers did, I think we paid 15 eu for each regardless (ie. 3/7 used it). Again, I factor it into the overall room cost, so be it. It does close Sunday so really given that you arrive saturday (after it closes) and Sunday is a no go, you get 5 days at best... Our dishwasher didn't work, it worked but didn't clean explaining the dishes we got at the beginning, we hand washed everything upon arrival. They give you one dishwaher tab and will sell you more of course.. Use dish soap and forgo the unit which doesn't work properly anyhow. They supply you with ample crockery for 7 in the 3 bedroom unit. Tons of stairs, dents in the walls, the main floor shower didn't work properly ,again, not the end of the world but odd for a 4 star unit, wife wasn't sold, but I was in holiday mode, lifes too short to bother & everything worked upstairs Annoyingly, they do have a laundry option in the parking lot, but it was ridiculously expensive, like 15 eu for a wash and another 15 for the dryer. You've go to be kidding, no wonder no one used it. Washing in the unit is possible but they do not allow you to hang anything on the balconies or outside, even in the crazy heat, again, one can work around it Internet - none... I mean none nearby, you must go into town really, we used cafe's around the main train station, cheap and convenient - if you are in a pickle the staff at the front may be nice enough to email a message to let family know you've arrived ok, same deal with transferring a call - no charge - after hours its automated - all your friends need to know is the room number provided in the email ;)", "Date": "March 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cDo Not Stay Here\u201d", "Author": "NapTravel70", "ReviewID": "UR24399967", "Content": "The resorts appearance was fine and clean. I am voicing a concern though, as I found the pricing of necessities, (taxis, laundry, shuttles, towels etc) extremely high and a tool used to gauge the guests financially. The taxis called are not always actual taxis but apparently someone's family member that gets called upon. These service's fees when compared to the same ones in town are much higher...to the tune of 30 percent. In addition the shuttle supplied by the timeshare has two scheduled pickups from the resort and two scheduled pickups from town. The pick ups from the resort are at 9am and 1 pm, which are adequate. The two from town are at 4pm and 7pm. This little practice making it impossible to have dinner in town and enjoy the late evenings with all they have to offer. Again, the staff profits from this, since guests are now forced to choose from \"the few restaurants that they have a contract with in the adjacent town\" OR catch one of \u201ctheir\u201d taxi for FIFTY Euros into town. The guest will be pleasantly surprised but at the same time aggravated when the exact same ride from town costs 35 Euros, including tip. The meals at these restaurants were nice but expensive when compared to same type of establishments in town. Not to mention the one restaurant where the meal is brought out without your consent as to the content of the meal. This method of service, although different was never mentioned by the Resort Staff and therefore not a pleasant surprise. There is a grocery store about three minutes away. The charge to have one of \"their taxis\" deliver you and pick you up? TWENTY EUROS. Ludicrous. A shuttle should be made available for this necessity. The Resort has also established the practice of completely changing your linen for 35 Euros during your stay. If by some chance the guest reads this, in their \"informative notebook\" they must cancel this or it will be automatically done and charged. The shuttle to the airport, another opportunity to gauge guests and timeshare owners. I was able to book a shuttle from the airport to the resort, with an extremely friendly driver in a clean, new large van. The cost? 60 Euros...without issue of any sort. The resort, when requested for a shuttle, gave us a giant van, simply because we requested the vehicle fit four fifty pound bags and three women all under 150 pounds. The vehicle provided fit a family of six and a few other friends, along with full luggage. It was enormous. The cost was a huge surprise to us at almost 100 Euros at the airport. The driver took the hundred euro bill and walked off with it without looking back as we ran after him while he jumped in the drivers seat. The pool and restaurant was not open Sat through Monday. Hence the use of the pool was not applicable, as the rest of the days we were in town. However, there is a 35Euro charge that is forced upon each guest, regardless of amenity availability. I should mention at this time, that the restaurant/bar is a cafeteria looking room with bananas, winnies, eggs and bread. For this luxury, the resort charges additional money. Again, this place is only open during hours convenient to them and not the guests. The shuttle was not available to go into town on Saturday or Sunday, so again, forced to use \"their\" services. One woman was always available, Mara. She was the only person you could find at her post during her hours of work. The others would disappear hours at a time. In all, the guest service are far below the \"silver and gold\" awards they have received by RCI. They added much stress to a vacation that should have been void of such negativity. RCI has the responsibility to their timeshare holders and guests to control and eliminate practices such as these. However, they have chosen to ignore what is going on and instead award these resorts. Extremely poor management and quality control by RCI for this resort. I am also afraid that if no action is taken by RCI, this situation will only worsen ruining many other vacations. mzap69@yahoo.com", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff and very convinient to Rome\u201d", "Author": "hanyhal", "ReviewID": "UR8134089", "Content": "We booked through the RCI.

Talk about a waste of 80 hours of vacation time. If you read the reviews about this place let me confirm that every one of them are true. We didn't lose water on this trip but every thing else happened to us, including getting robbed on the metro. Think European Vacation and multiply it by 3, that was our experience at this place. I highly recommend you read all the reviews on this place first before making any commitment to staying there. I will say that most of the staff was semi-helpful, Alex in particular. Language did not seem to be a major problem, but that was the only thing. The manager herself couldn't get it together and constantly changed her decisions from one day to the next, making the stay that much more uncomfortable. The moment we checked in our welcome was a fight with the manager, which introduced us to the place. We had just come off a long airplane ride, had a lot of trouble finding the place, were extremely tired, and the manager gets an attitude. What a joke. I knew then that we were in for a very long two weeks. Fortunately we only dealt with her the first three days and the very last day we were there. Alex, however, proved to be most helpful but his authority was very limited. We never used the \"services\" (pool and what not) but still had to pay for them (30 Euros per person). Add 3 Euros per person per trip in their \"shuttle\", multiply it by 5 and it adds up quickly. Then add a lot of hidden charges that took us by surprise. We went there with the understanding that we could put 5 people in our room, but the second week they changed our room and would not permit the fifth person. Thus we had to split the family sending our two daughters to another hotel in Rome. Who, by the way, got the better end of the deal. I wish I could remember the name of the hotel we sent the girls to but it escapes me at the moment. However, it was clean, with continental breakfast, and very, very reasonable (only $460 [dollars not Euros], for 6 days for two girls). My wife, son, and I were very envious. They also had access to great transportation, not like us who had to rely on the whim of Carpediem. Now for the rooms. A dog kennel would have been preferred. Room service was the pits, as I had to ask for clean towels three times during our two week stay. There was no insulation between the lower floor and the upper floor, hence you could hear everything going on upstairs. Then there were the smokers, with no insulation and poor ventilation, smoke came from everywhere. Now normally cigarette smoke does not bother me (I don't smoke) but in this case it did. Poor ventilation was the cause of this. So if I was suffering from this think about what it was doing to my wife who is very sensitive to these types of pollutants. It made sleeping miserable as the room was full of smoke. Everything in the room was inconvenient (both rooms that we stayed in). The dishes were dirty and had to be hand washed, the dishwashers didn't work, the stoves took forever to bring heat, and the staff hardly ever emptied the trash. Carpediem does everything for their convenience, not the customer. They do not go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and nice. It is in short hell. In fact hell would have been preferred. My advice to anyone planning a Rome trip: DON'T. But if you do, whatever happens, NEVER stay at the Carpediem Roma Golf Club.
