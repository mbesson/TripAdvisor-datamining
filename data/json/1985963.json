We arrived at the hotel and were greated by a friendly doorman who made us feel very important from the get-go. We entered the hotel to check in, and were very supprised to be greated by our names...(Im still not sure how that happened but was definetly a nice touch). After being escorted to our suite by the bellman, he gave us a tour of the room and showed us how everything worked ( rooms are a little technical- touch panel for the lighting and drapes, tv in the bathroom mirror). Overall we bothed loved the room; they are big,luxurious, and modern! We didnt get a chance to use the spa as we were only there for one night, but we did receive a tour of the facility. It looked really great- I'm sure my wife will spend many hours there on our next visit. The service at this hotel is probably the best I have ever recieved; the staff seem geuinely happy and more than willing to help with anything. I definitely plan on staying here again.

Nevertheless, I would like to share my experience I had with my contact person from the reservation department, Mr. Eric Sinclair. Since I am from overseas, at my first contact with him, I had numerous questions which he patiently answered in a very pleasant manner. I once spoke with him over the phone and from then on via e-mail. My e-mails were always answered immediately. He is incredibly competent and once he told me he would have to ask his supervisor and get back to me in about 4 hours - well, sure enough, no minute later, I received his answer. When I get the chance to travel to Toronto in September this year, I will surely book a room at the Trump and hope that everything else in the hotel is just as perfect as Mr. Sinclair.

First of all, staff are clearly there to please, and make every effort to welcome you and provide great service. But when we checked in, our package included a room upgrade and breakfast. The front desk made no mention of these details. So when we got to the room I called to confirm and I was told oh yes - we upgraded your room. This is something you really ought to mention upon check in, otherwise how is the guest supposed to know? The room itself was lovely. We were in a deluxe king suite, and it was beautiful. The fireplace was on when we walked in, and the staff made us feel so welcome and special. Shortly after we settled, there was a knock at the door and we were served with complimentary bottled water and an assortment of cookies and snacks. We asked for an extra robe (there were 3 of us) and some plates, and these were delivered right away. I don't usually pay attention to the bathroom goodies, but it's worth mentioning. From a beautiful sugar scrub to body butter, combined with a deep soaker tub, it's a lovely experience. A note about room service - disappointing. We ordered waffles and felt short changed - seems that we were given two orders of waffles but only one order of fruit and clotted cream. It left us feeling pretty hungry afterwards. The presentation of the waffles was pretty disappointing, let alone the Weight Watchers portion. For the price, we weren't impressed. Also, we ordered 'fresh squeezed orange juice\" at a significant cost, and we were served Tropicana. I hate that. All in all, the Trump hotel is a great new hotel and I'm excited to stay there again in the hopes that things improve. It really is a luxe experience, and hopefully management will keep a close eye on Trip Advisor and take this feedback into account.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellence Defined an Experience by Pri~ Photography\u201d", "Author": "Priten M", "ReviewID": "UR125259837", "Content": "Impressive, excellent, amazing, some of few words people may use to describe the hotel itself.

At the check in desk we felt very welcome as if the staff were actually happy to see us. We were literally treated like VIP, as were all of our guests who came to visit that night. The amenities of the room were fantastic. We thoroughly enjoyed the automated system for the lights, blinds, heated floors for the washrooms and a TV in every room. They even thought of the small details, such as providing an ipod/iphone charging dock and a usb charging cable. Breakfast at Stock restaurant, located on the 31st floor, was both healthy and delicious. Flavorful cheeses and freshly squeezed juice accompanied the delicious breakfast options and the home-made yogurt was fantastic. During our checkout we were taken care of by Kervin Van Den Meijdenberg, who was very accommodating and pleasant.

They have an attach\u00c3\u00a9 service which was second to none and the lady we had took care of everything was 100% perfect in every way, could not fault her. Stock restaurant presented beautiful food, I had the fillet topped with crab, outstanding! I have so much praise for this hotel, from the food at the STOCK restaurant to the maids, concierge, front desk, spa, bar servers, the general manager (who brought ice to our room - so very hands on which I thought was wonderful!), the door men, guys who take your luggage to the room, are amazing! They love to assist you, even if just to chat with you whilst waiting for people, just very caring, honest people who all love their jobs! Great value for money in every way! You must try this hotel. I leave in 2 days and am tempted to extend my stay another few nights! WOW and blown away sums up my feelings. To the staff if they get to read this, keep up the amazing work!

There were definitely some positives and a few opportunities for improvement. The areas of opportunity include: 1. They over cooked my steak I ordered the tenderloin medium rare and it came out medium. When I mentioned it to our server, he agreed that it was in fact over cooked. He of course offered to have a new one cooked for me however I didn't want to wait for a 2nd steak so I ate the one they gave me. In the end, they offered us a complimentary dessert as a result which I thought was nice - having the steak taken off the bill would have been better however... 2. The View This restaurant is on the 31st Floor of the Hotel which should boast nice views of downtown Toronto, however all of the windows had curtains on them blocking the views - not quite sure why. 3. The Hotel Lobby From what we could see, you enter through the revolving door and the lobby consists of a concierge and front desk with a bar in the back.....very small and not that impressive. Maybe there was another entrance? Now, onto the Positives 1. The Service Our server, Darren, was great. Very responsive, knowledgable about the menu and wine list. The manager came around more than once to ask how we were enjoying ourselves. 2. The Size of the Restaurant It is a small restaurant when compared to other hotel restaurants in Toronto - which to us was nice. 3. The Music The DJ and music played was great! I had a chance to speak with the DJ towards the end of the night and it was clear based on our conversation that he is a professional DJ - not some kid who just downloaded a bunch of songs onto a playlist and hit shuffle. His music selections and mixes were perfect for the environment. 4. The Dessert The staff added a candle to my dessert given that it was my birthday which was a nice touch. And the Molten Chocolate Cake was delicious!
