We think that it is worth staying if you are on a budget for its friendly staff and cleanliness. Admittedly, the hotel is quite remote from the city centre. Be prepared it takes time to the city centre. You have to take the metro and a bus to get there. It takes us a lot of effort to get there at the very first time. But the hotel owner(i think he is the hotel owner, but i'm not sure) gives us free ride to the metro every morning, which saves a lot of our time. He is very friendly. You can ask him almost everything about your travel. Generally,the room is spotless and very cosy. The hotel provides free wifi, free hot drinks and a computer in the lobby for everybody to use. There is also a printer available so that you can print out maps, train schedule for free, which, I think, is very useful and thoughtful.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devizes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood value hotel\u201d", "Author": "Small30", "ReviewID": "UR78135991", "Content": "This hotel is clean and functional, ideal if you want somewhere to park a car and then travel into Rome on public transport, Rooms are very clean and well appointed for the price, air conditioning worked well.

The bus runs past the hotel to the metro (hotel staff give you the number) then the metro costs 1 euro each for 75 minutes travel, we took about 35 mins on average from hotel to termini station. The Open top tour bus in Rome is great value 18 euro for 2 days (Adult) as you can hop on & off. We ate at La Bottegaccia which is about 400 metres from the hotel, Georgio (the owners son) speaks good English and the food is totally Italian and very good, main course and drink for four was 46 euro , which we thought was very good .

You have to get a bus to the metro and then metro into the city,which is fine in the daylight but i would not reccomend after dark for your return, the metro stop is a very rundown filthty area,with many beggers and shady looking characters. the hotel has no other facilities other than a bedroom, no where to have a drink,no food,and not even a bit of piped music, I have been in mortuarys that had better atmosphere !!

We knew what to expect from reading previous tripadvisor reviews, which we found very helpfull regarding which buses to use to get from the hotel to the metro, we even printed the reviews out and brought them with us as a reference! The hotel is closer to Ciampino airport then to Da Vinci, so if you are travelling with ryanair or easyjet this is much more convenient. The hotel itself has a lovely garden area, and is quite spacious and airy indoors. Our room was on the lower floor, the room and bathroom were big (and comfortable) but basic style-wise with white painted walls and no colour scheme, but for E42 each per night with breakfast this didn't bother us. The room had an archway with a few steps up to another area which had nothing in it but a single bed, air conditioner and two windows at the top of the wall overlooking the ground outdoors! We thought this a bit unusual but the extra space was nice, obviously if you want a view this isn't ideal.Also, although everything else was fine, I stepped onto the bed to look out the high windows, and the indoor window ledges were very dusty and the paint was flaking off, but other then that as I said the room was very clean.And I guess your not suppossed to see that area, as there is a remote control to open and close the windows and for the air conditioner.The only other complaint I have with the room is that there is no safety deposit box, so we had to make do without which was a little worrying. There is a lovely sitting area on the roof, and it felt like such a waste of resourses to have the area there with no real purpose. A restaurant or even snack bar and some sun beds on the roof terrace and this hotel would be halfway to adding another star. Breakfast was nothing special, there was barely any food left (no bread products or orange juice at all) our first morning, even though we were half an hour before end time. We got up earlier the second morning and breakfast consisted of croissants (sweet and savoury),bread rolls, cheese and salami slices, orange juice, selection of coffees, and cereal. TV only has italian channels which was dissapointing, and the only other thing worth mentioning is that most of the people working in this hotel don't have very good english, although there was one girl who did and was very helpfull to us the day of the metro strike. We had to check out during the night cause we had an early flight, and the man in reception called our room to wake us up half an hour before our taxi was due, which I thought was a nice touch. One last thing, Great little pizza place near the hotel out and down to your right, near the bus stop, best pizza I've ever had! Would definately stay here again, this kind of value for money is unbeatable in a city like Rome.", "Date": "October 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northants, England", "Title": "\u201ca great time\u201d", "Author": "duganddianne", "ReviewID": "UR5810098", "Content": "Booked this Hotel through Ryanair, arriving late in the evening but welcomed at reception and then into our clean, airconditioned, comfortable bedroom.

Very clean with daily maid service. Room spacious. On the whole the hotel was quiet with friendly staff. The breakfast room was very relaxing with a varied breakfast of continental style. The distance from the centre wasn\u2019t a problem to us. It did involve a 10minute bus journey from just outside the hotel to bus station \u2013 Arc di Trevitino. From there we caught a metro to the centre. This took a further 20-30 minutes depending on which part of the city. 1 euro per trip of 75 minutes as stated in previous reviews. Also mentioned previously was the La Bottegaccia restaurant. We have to agree the meal we had here was excellent value for money. Many restaurants in Rome pride themselves on food being freshly prepared and not pre packed frozen meals. This is often specified on menus. There is also a little bar/coffee shop (Il Veliero) across the road from this restaurant \u2013 ideal for a cappucino and cake for a couple of euros. By booking our hotel 2 weeks in advance we paid \u00a339 per night per double room and found it excellent value for money. We decided not to taxi from the airport \u2013 we were advised to expect a 50 euro journey. We were approached by a taxi driver quoting 50 euros which was dropped to 30 whilst we waited for a bus. We arrived at a good time and we weren\u2019t in a rush so we caught the cotral bus, then a metro (to Arc di Trevitino) and then bus 765 to the hotel. Took a couple of hours all in all but only cost 2 euros each. Excellent experience and prepared us for our local transport trips for the next few days!!!

The rooms are of a good size and very clean, hotel staff are friendly but only speak a little English. Breakfast is a continental breakfast consisting of Croissants and Jam with a choice of hot drinks, this was acceptable but nothing exceptional. Although the hotel itself is very nice and has attractive grounds where guests can sit and chat, drink etc. the local area is largely residential and as such has very few shops and restaurants although there are a supermarket and a fairly nice restaurant within 10 minutes walk. If you are looking for more lively surroundings, the best option is to take the public transport into the centre of Rome. For 1 Euro each you can purchase a 75 minute travel card from the tobacconist which is 5 minutes walk down the road after turning right out of the hotel gate. This allows you to take bus 765 from the stop opposite the toy shop (another minute or two past the tobacconist) to the Arca di travertino tube station. From here you can catch a Metro (underground) to the main train station Rome Termini which has transport to all other areas of rome e.g. Colosseum, vatican etc. The bus ticket will also work on the Metro and in theory allows you to travel the whole of Rome for 1 euro. However, although you will never have your ticket checked on the buses, the gates in the Metro station will reject it after the 75 minutes have expired. The Metro service is very punctual and frequent however a word of warning, during certain times the metros can be extremelly overcrowded with no room to even move your arms. This was particularly evident between Rome Termin and the colosseo (Colosseum) station. However don't let this put you off since the sights in Rome are amazing and well worth travelling to see.", "Date": "July 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cHotel victor\u201d", "Author": "steven1967", "ReviewID": "UR4972562", "Content": "Nice hotel, rooms were pretty big for a 3*hotel.

Rooms and hotel in general were always kept clean, had plenty of storage space to unpack, staff were friendly enough & spoke English well - which was good for me as i cant speak Italian. Great pizza restaurant near it too, take a right turn when coming out of the hotel and walk about 5 - 10 mins till you come to a small yellow entrance. We found it by luck, appeared to be a small family run place but great food - and the wine was very pleasant too. Also it was very well priced. If your off to Rome to visit the bars and clubs then this hotel may be expensive as taxis were about 20 - 30 euro to get back from city centre but if your using is a base to start for sightseeing then its ideal.

As you are leaving the Hotel Victor you will need to immediatly turn Right.....walk down the street on the right hand side of the road for approx 200 yards untill you rech a bus stop that is inconvenantly in a car park. the bus you want if you wish to go to the city centre is the 765 (you can get a ticket of a gentleman with wavy hair in the tabbachi on the same side of the road as the bus stop. this bus after 10-15 minutes of pleassent journeying time will take you directly to Arco De Travertino. Once there..keep tight hold of your bus tickett for it also works on the subway and allows you to access barriers etc. However dont be fooled by the 75 minutes printed on the card. this means nothing as all the machines still work. In theory you could use all of Romes public transport as nobody ever checks your tickett. Once you have gotten to the subway on arco de travertino all you need do is look at the destinations lists titled on the walls. Line B for Colloseum etc, once your figure it out then its pretty easy. However my advice would be to simply get off at the Colloseo and walk round Rome..all the major sites are within walking distance and you can discover lots of wonderful things by not bothering with subways etc. If you like seeing all the ancient Roman ruins i strongly recommend the roman Forum. As soon as you leave the colloseo you'll be approached by an itlaien or an english person asking if you speek english. this will no doubt be a rep from the Romearound group. at first i thought they were con merchants etc. but they actually offer a really good deal. its about 20 euros each for a tour of the colloseum which is actually rather good. for this you get to jump the queues which are exceptionally long and get to know whatever you want about the colloseum etc. Bare in mind the colloseum doesnt have much in the way of English descriptive info stations etc, so having someone tell you all about it is really helpful. We also managed to get a free tour (romearound again) of the roman forum from a delightful english girl (Kate she was called) who was full of knowledge on her chosen area and had her audience capticvated for a good hour before we parted ways. I hope the above helps. If however you want to get to the Hotel Victor from the airport this can be a costly if not complicated affair. personally i would recommend a taxi as the luggage you'll be carrying coupled with the heat, humidity and kids screaming will result in arguments with your spouse etc. should cost in the region of 50-60 euros but is well worth it after a long flight. Also if you see an itlaien looking at you on the subway, just try to look away. they do this to everyone...its a bit odd and does take some getting used too. i think they just like to see what your wearing..either that or they have just never been told stairing is rude.
