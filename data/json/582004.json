Our adventure started when the innkeeper \"mistakenly\" thought we had booked for Saturday and Sunday night rather than the Friday and Saturday we reserved. We came to realize the innkeeper was quite prone to mistakes and although I'm generally an understanding person, the management at the Askin made absolutely no effort to make amends for their mistakes. After arguing for several minutes, the manager begrudgingly offered a small room directly adjacent to his family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarters on the ground floor. Although the room had clean sheets, there was no soap, no trash can, no hot water and a damp water glass with mold at the bottom. When I asked for soap to take a shower, he disappeared for a minute and came back with a bottle of antibacterial hand soap. The next day, the manager moved us to the type of room he had originally promised. After we moved the bags to the room ourselves (which still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready yet), we dropped things off and left for a meal. Upon our return, the manager indicated he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mistakenly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd promised the room to another customer and moved us to yet another room, again with no soap or hot water - except this room had no shower head. When I asked for soap, he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if I find some, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring it to your room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and further indicated there was nothing he could do about the missing shower head.
