Upon checkout I looked at our billing and it was correct except for the $8.00 tip we had charged to the room at breakfast. The front desk person told me that was ok, that it would post later. However, a few days after our stay, I reviewed my credit card billings on line and saw a $93.00 additonal charge from the ZAZA. I immediatley sent an email asking what the charges were for. I got a response and was told that (name omitted), front desk manager, would contact me. This was on Thursday, March 22. As of Tuesday, March 27, I had heard nothing. I sent another email and the response was \"(Name omitted) took care of this.\" That is all fine and good, but I wanted an explanation. After a couple of back and forths, the following is an excerpt from the email I received from (Nameomitted), Guest Service Representative: .\" I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve attached a copy of your folio with these charges represented. Now, I went ahead and removed the mini-bar charge and posted it as a user error. But as far as the $8 tip at the Dragonfly, I am unable to authorize a credit for that transaction. If you would like to further discuss the charge, please, call me at the front desk and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be more than happy to connect you to the General Manager at Dragonfly. I hope this issue has been resolved and if you have any other questions feel free to email me directly. Thank you for your patience. I hope you have a wonderful day(: \" First of all, I never contested the $8.00 tip. Secondly, perhaps it is just my take, but it makes me feel like the hotel has given me credit to appease us; that they feel we ate, drank or whatever this stuff was that was charged to us.

It is well insulated so we didn't hear a lot of noise - in fact, what woke us up (twice) was security issuing warnings to the room across from us. We never heard a peep out of that particular room so I am not sure what the deal was. I did appreciate, though, that security was quick to take care of \"problem\" rooms. My only real issue with the hotel was the bathroom. I am a total bathroom snob - considering the decor of the room and the reputation of the hotel, I really thought the bathroom needed a significant upgrade. Our room had a teeny, tiny tub - I am five feet, two inches and 100 pounds - the tub was too small for me. Most people would not use a tub like that - why not take the tubs out and instead, install a glassed in shower? This also gets rid of the nasty shower curtain.

One example is that I got up at 5am to workout and free coffee on each floor does not come to 6am. The night manager went and got me coffee on a silver planter. We also were checked in at the front desk less than a minute and greeted at the front door. For work out freaks there is a gold's gym an half block away that you can use with your hotel key or just use the hotel gym for a mild workout. I needed to work out due to the fact that the food at the dragonfly(hotel restaurant) was out of this world. Great cooks and wait staff every night. The dragonfly manager name is chaz.

When my fiance and I were planning a summer trip to Dallas, a friend recommended Zaza and from the reviews online I decided it would be great. We stayed for two nights in a deluxe king room and I'd say Zaza strives to be on par with any of today's luxury boutique hotels. There's a lot that has already been said about this place, but here are my top 3 praises: 1. Fabulous staff & top notch service. The majority of the staff were all young and good looking, but they lacked the snootiness of other places (see my scathing review of the Edition in Waikiki). We just happened to be staying there right when the NBA finals were going on in Dallas (which made for fun nights out). However, despite what I assumed was a full-house, the staff never made us feel rushed or unwanted. Thank you! 2. The courtesy hotel shuttle. They have at least 2 shuttles on hand (if not more), so we never had to wait for a FREE shuttle to return. On top of that, the shuttle drivers had tons of fabulous suggestions for places to see, eat, and drink. 3. Dragonfly and poolside dining. The pool and dragonfly restaurant provided much needed reprieve from the 100 degree weather. I expected the restaurant to be pricey, but was surprised by their VERY reasonable prices. We had lunch there and I had the ahi tacos (tasty) for $10 and my fiance ordered a BLT (also only $10). Although tiny, the restaurant/bar is a vibrant little space decorated for my hidden hipster. 4. I know I said top 3, but I must mention that the pressure from the shower head was amazing. I don't think I've had that great of a shower in any hotel before. I don't have any real criticisms of the hotel. However, I am a 20-something young professional so I think this place was more suited to my style than a family with young kids.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cIt's Fun Staying ZaZa!\u201d", "Author": "trtzw", "ReviewID": "UR112602925", "Content": "This was a great experience.

If you're looking for a party hotel, Za Za will work for you, but if you're a light sleeper or want a more relaxing time, I'd be wary. The ugly: The service was simply awful. We had reserved 2 rooms- 1 for 3 nights and the 2nd for 2 nights. They couldn't find the 2nd reservation. Even with my printed confirmation from Jetsetter, it was still a hassle. OK, these sorts of things happen, but the people at the front desk were so unbelievably rude about it. Apparently, I was causing them a tremendous inconvenience to give us our 2nd (and PREPAID) room. They also have a complimentary shuttle- in theory. We called down to the valet stand to ask if they would take us to a specific area. They said yes, and recommended a time to leave to avoid rush hour traffic. When we went downstairs, they told us the destination was too far (I got 3 different mileage requirements over the course if our stay) and we would have to take a taxi. When I explained that we had been told differently on the phone, the valet was extremely rude (again) and kept questioning me with the implication that we were lying! Lastly, we had some questionable charges on our bill at check out. There were charges showing up as \"room service charges\" when we had never ordered room service. It turned out that they were bar charges that were classified incorrectly, but I felt justified in questioning it since the descriptions were unclear. Furthermore, our waitress at the bar the previous evening had simply disappeared and I couldn't find her to sign my bill. So I wanted to be sure we were not overcharged. Again, the woman at the desk was beyond rude. It was pretty much the last straw. The whole thing really put a damper on our girls weekend. And I was pretty appalled that a hotel billed as 4 star would have such terrible service.

Shrugged all this off as we came to party, so we changed clothes and while in the restroom I noticed the floor of the shower was not as clean as I am used to, lots of soap scum on the floor and I notice some of the tile work starting to crack plus the door handle to the bathroom was coming loose (I fixed that). Get down to the New Years Eve party, security was great checking everyone for arm bands and proper dress attire they were on their A game that night so kudos to them, however the bartenders although overwhelmed and understaffed were plain RUDE especially the femal bartender in the first bar to the right when you came in, owning a bar back where we live I understand the stress they get when it gets super crazy busy but there is no room for rudeness as if this happened at my bar she would of been let go the next day but we didn't let them ruin our night the party was a blast we had our fair share of spirits and toasted in a New Year in style. Next morning get up around 9am of course not feeling the best and looking forward to a nice hot shower, turn on the shower and notice the shower head is broken the center ring is loose and water is shooting out the back, side and front of the shower head I didn't feel so hot so calling the front dest for a new shower head was not in the cards, however this was so bad this had to of been an problem from the previous guest or at least house cleaning should of caught this so staff needs to replace the shower head on room 311, thanks!!! We get all cleaned up go down to eat breakfast place our order and then move tables to accomodate our friends who came down from their room, now at this point it's been close to 30 minutes since we place our order of pancakes and waffles whish is pretty basic, another 15 minutes go by and we had to waive down the only waiter that seemed to be happy he is there and he goes back and says it's coming right out, another 10 minutes go by and he finally brings our food and apologizes and explains they simply screwed up and I appreciated his honesty much better than a lame excuse. My date goes to take a drink out of her glass of Dr.Pepper and there is a milk carton top and the plastic security strip IN HER GLASS!!! Yes in her glass, we waived down the waiter again and explain what is going on and I can tell he is just like kill me now but again offers a sincere apology and quickly replaces it with a fresh glass and soda, we eat then check out. Overall we had fun, but were let down by a few things I never expected from this hotel, less than adequate cleanliness, hotel staff rudeness, poor car service which I chalk up to the New Years Eve event, rude bartenders due to their stress and understaffing and the hour and half breakfast for simple food. I know alot was going on that weekend but this should of been taken in account for and staffed properly, I left my bar in good hands and properly staffed before coming to Dallas and it worked beautifully hopefully ZaZa won't let us down in the future as we love coming here.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "winnipeg", "Title": "\u201cThe place looks nice but the service is terrible\u201d", "Author": "ejhWinnipeg", "ReviewID": "UR90439453", "Content": "We had trouble with non-functional toilet, safety deposit box and air-conditioning.

While the property is ideally situated and our balcony room was spacious and tastefully done, the surly security staff put a damper on our visit and as a result, I won't ever return. About an hour after we checked in and after I had left for my reunion dinner, my husband stopped at the convenience store across the street for some of his favorite Belgian beers as ZaZa carried less than stellar brands and was QUESTIONED and searched by security while re-entering the property. My husband was properly dressed and groomed and had just been greeted by security before he crossed the street to go the store. It was truly a bizzare spectacle and a mere taste of what was to follow. I was so incensed by this that I called the hotel from my reunion and the operator acknowledged that outside alcohol was prohibited but that security should not have behaved so brusquely to my husband. I suggested that they mention this policy to their guests at check in as I had just witnessed some young women bringing in a bottle of wine with them at check in. That night we were kept awake until after 2am by the nightclub scene congregating around the pool below our room, but we understood that Zaza has a very Vegas like atmosphere and left it at that and enjoyed watching the scene from our balcony. However, the following night a group of us were gathering in one of our rooms following our reunion in ZaZa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ballroom and were having fun catching up after all these years when security pounded on the door and demanded everyone leave the room. There were 8 of us in a double room at the time. My husband pointed out to them that we were all guests, there was more noise being made below at the pool and just about every other room in the hotel was throbbing with noise and music. The security thugs insisted we leave. I admit my husband was rather annoyed by their surly attitude and let them know it, but we returned to our room and while we were readying for bed the director of security pounded on our door. When I peered through the peep hole, security said they would call the police if we didn't open the door. Really? We are bunch of 30 somethings getting together for a reunion and we have spent thousands of dollars over two days in their establishment and they treat their guests like that? The whole situation was a travesty. When we asked why they were bothering us in our room they said \" This is MY hotel and we got a call that you was making noise up in here all night so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming to investigate\". We explained that we had been out of our room until this point. When I called the front desk, they confirmed that security were actually mad at my husband for getting upset when they came to our friend's room. How ridiculous! We did not deface any property and were far less loud than several other guestrooms including the cacophony by the pool. Quite simply the thugs they hire for security have power trips and no concept of customer service. Meanwhile my husband and I couldn't get rest due to the thumping rap music from the room next to us. We called to complain and nothing was done. I mentioned again to the front desk at checkout how disappointed we were with their terrible security guards and their brutish behavior only to be met with a shrug and was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well hopefully you enjoyed your stay until that point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That was the worst $1200 in two days I have ever spent! I was even more dismayed the following day when I found out that the security guard who caused this whole debacle eventually returned to my friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room to hang out with them once his shift was over. My friends even sent me a video to prove it. Lo and behold, there is the security guard sitting on the couch enjoying himself with MY friends while I was too scared to leave my room due to ZaZa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intimidation tactics.

The staff knew this upon reservation and were told when reserving that we wanted to reserve a room with a balcony overlooking the pool area so we could party in the room and also down by the pool. This was the key reason for booking this particular hotel. Upon arrival, we see that the pool area is under construction and would be closed for the entire weekend. No apologies were provided or sorry we are not meeting your expectations, let me offer a complimentary bottle of champagne or something. Just its closed and when inquired if this was posted for guests to see and be aware of - was told very arrogantly, its closed every year this particular weekend (like we should know that). At $500 per night, I expect a little more than attitude. So off to a very disappointing start to begin what should be a special weekend for me. Also, at check in they had glasses of complimentary champagne. Ok, that's nice. Except there were 3 of us and not much left so sorry girls, you'll have to share and by the way, one of the glasses broke and you'll just have to use it if you want any. Again, $500 a night and you can't find another glass? So rather than go to the hotel bar / pool area we headed out to uptown and had a great time. Saturday - time for an afternoon of spa treatments for me and 2 of my bridesmaids. After trying to confirm appointments all week and told the voicemail system wasn't working so even though you left a message, no one calls you back. This was for days. We walked in to confirm in person. One girl was completely left off the books for her appointments. So again, no apologies or let me see what we can do to fix this - just no she's not here. We had to purposely ask - well, can you book her in. Oh yes, certainly. What? We have to beg for this? So after getting her squared away, we leave to have lunch. Came back after lunch for our appointments and the girl who was not on the books ended up sitting in the waiting room for over a half hour because no one told the massage therapist she had an appointment so the therapist went to lunch! So her appointment being later then proceeded to make my appointment a half hour late. Which is just unprofessional at a spa of this level. And while standing in the waiting room, a therapist and the receptionist got into a huge screaming match and the therapist quit. Not something guests should have to witness. Unprofessional. The one glowing review I can provide is the bartender was very nice to our group and made me feel special for my bachelorette party. Julian - you were great. So I do think this hotel is very cool looking and the rooms are very comfortable but for the customer service we received, it is far over priced.

Scheduled check in was for 3pm on Friday. One of our guests was flying in and arrived before us (her name was not on reservation); however the front desk girl worked it out and she was able to check into our rooms 2hrs early. Valet and check in went smoothly, no problems. We had 2 balcony rooms with double beds overlooking the pool area. The rooms were clean, spacious, and funky. Beds were very comfortable and the mini bar was well stocked. The bathroom was large and easily accommodated 3 girls getting dressed for a night out. While getting ready we made cocktails and needed lemons and lime, the room service staff was quick to respond, requiring little delay of our celebration. The hotel bar, by the pool, was great and the bartenders very attentive. The pool area is fairly small for as popular of a place as it is. There may be only about 30-40 lounge chairs. I made sure to wake early the next morning to ensure we had lounge chairs at the pool. I had coffee at the pool while I waited on my party to awake and join me. Around 11am the pool area started filling up, and luckily my friends had aroused from their slumber by this time to secure their lounges. By 1pm it was packed, but not in a bad way. However if you wait til 1230 or 1 to come down plan on sitting/ laying on the cement. I spent the entire day from around 930am til 430pm at the pool lounging, having cocktails (wonderful), and lunch with my girlfriends \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 One caveat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the pool is freezing, even when it was 100F outside. But besides that the pool day was perfect! We asked the front desk the best way to get to our restaurant (cab, trolly, etc) because we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t driving, she said the hotel has a vehicle that they would drive us. I think it was an expedition, but whatever it was it was a nice large SUV that comfortably held the 5 of us. The only fee is tipping the driver (which we tipped about $25 for a 5min ride) and then he gave us a card and told us to call when we were ready to be picked up. After dinner we called and he was there in less than 10min. Great service. That evening we had a cocktail at the pool bar before heading to dinner at Nick & Sam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. We talked with the bartender who was there the night before, mentioned it was our birthday and he gave us a glass of champagne to start the celebration. When we told him where we were going for dinner he said a good friend of his manages over there, tell him we are friends of him blah blah blah (but who really does that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hi I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m friends of bartender X and expect you to do something special for me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 ) He then said never mind and texted her right then to let her know we were coming (you never know what to expect with that type of thing). But when we got the restaurant we were seated and they brought out a round of champagne for our party of 5 and then a birthday card addressed to me and the other birthday girl. Just a very nice personal touch that I applaud ZaZa staff and Nick & Sam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for. Little things can truly make or break a moment. Rest of the evening at ZaZa was spent with a Tarot card reader who they have come about 2 times a month. I highly suggest it, different and much fun for a group of girls.

They were rudely told that they the pool/cocktail area was designated for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel guests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd only.

For the staff to sit at a table during a wedding reception visible to other guests is ridiculous! My thoughts are that the staff should eat only after an event and after all guests have eaten. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 We ran out of the beef tenderloin early in the evening. The amount of guests was accurate to the amount that we paid for. So running out of food was not a miscalculation due to more guest than expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I noticed that several of our guests were drinking beverages in plastic cups. I was not trying to nit-pick, but we paid for our wedding to be at Hotel Zaza! My expectations were that no guests should be drinking out of cheap plastic cups. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 We had more than 5 meetings with our Zaza event coordinators.

However, she did not attend. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 After the wedding we attempted to bring our concerns to the attention of our coordinator, Rose More. Most specifically, the issue pertaining to the valet. Rose became defensive and basically denied that this issues could have happened. Our concerns where met with a very defensive tone.

Be aware of the hidden costs.... $20 per night for valet parking, the fridge is full with drinks (can of coke $4!), also the bath room offers shaving cream ($28) and other little cool spa/ personal hygiene items.... but all at extra charge. We did not eat at the restaurant. There is a required dress code. Overall, this is a modern hotel with its own style maybe for younger couples.

We only paid $200 per night which we felt was a good bargain for the quality of the hotel. First of all EVERYBODY is extremely professional but also very friendly from the doormen, the bell staff, the front desk, the restaurant staff, the spa staff and the housekeeping staff. You couldn't pass anyone without getting a nice greeting and a \"if I can do anything for you please ask.\" There was not a disgruntled employee in the bunch. We got two couples massages and the massage therapists were absolutely fantastic (Edith and Alec) and were probably the best massages we've ever had. They were $100+ per person for a 50 minute massage but were well worth it. The hotel itself is beautiful and the room is very relaxing - good sheets, pillows, bath robes, workable desk with enough pencils, paper, etc. The restaurant food is excellent and we tried it for breakfast each day and dinner one night. The pool area is small but we were able to lay out by the pool one afternoon that it wasn't too crowded and got a nice lounger. The bartender came around and catered to our drink needs and also came around with a bucket full of popcicles for everybody (gratis) - nice touch. Of course, the price of the drinks are quite high but we kind of expected that. You do have to watch the cost of some of the items as nothing at ZaZa is inexpensive but we expected to pay more than usual and we were treating ourselves so it was fine. The bellmen were very helpful in choosing restaurants, making reservations and even printed out exact directions for us. The only real downside was that on Friday and Saturday night the pool/bar area outside is a real party location with so many people from outside the hotel that we found it impossible to get in. Also, be prepared for the rich, blond, 20 something year old crowd because that is what frequents ZaZa in the evening and around the pool, We are in our late 40's and are used to a younger group but some people may not be comfortable in that atmosphere. Finally, it seems that the hotel gives it's employees the power to make every guests' stay memorable. We met the Director of Housekeeping in the elevator on the last full day of our stay and she inquired how were doing and if we enjoyed wine and what kind. We told her we drink Pinot Noir and that night when we got back to our room there was a complimentary bottle of Pinor Noir from her with a nice card. It was a very nice way to end our stay.

The tapestries, the chandeliers, etc.. They have themed rooms which looked pretty cool. If you want a balcony room, make sure you just book it and not hope for that free upgrade. Balcony rooms are the first to go! You feel very welcomed from when you get out of your car to when you leave. The doorman was super nice and very personable. You can even bring a pet, although I don't know what the restrictions or charges are for that. Oh yeah, this is not a place to bring your kids unless they are 21+. It's a very poshy adult scene at Hotel Zaza. You will probably be a bit uncomfortable with your kids. The Rooms. The rooms are way cute with a very modern feel. We stayed in the deluxe 425 sq. ft. room. Our friend stayed in the smaller 384 sq. ft. room and it was also cute. Same decor, smaller room, so there's not too much space. It's worth the extra dollars to get the larger room. It's more open and roomier. We got the room on the \"Club ZaZa Level\" which is the 4th floor. You can only access this floor by swiping your card key in the elevator. But from what I heard, there really is no difference in rooms between a normal room and a Club Zaza level room. It's just a more secured floor. The bathroom was large and they let you use a complimentary robe. There are little toiletry baskets in the bathroom. Some is free (shampoo, conditioner, lotion) but the rest is not. So be careful when taking that stuff and be clear on which items you have to pay for and which items you don't. There is a price list in this basket. There is also a mini fridge and a snack basket in the room. The price list ranges from a $4 kit-kat (small size) to a $5 soda. There are liquor bottles in there as well from GreyGoose to Johnny Walker Black Label, to wines, and even champagne. Again, check the prices on these items before you grab. If you hate the noise and prefer quiet either stay at another hotel or ask to be placed at the opposite end of the pool/Dragonfly Lounge area. It is quite noisy. Our room was the furthest away (but facing the pool's direction, we had a clear view of the pool area) and we heard the music crystal clear. It didn't bother us, but if you're the type it would bother, I wouldn't recommend staying here. The Food. The food is great! I had brunch there and it was excellent! But be warned....four of us ate and only ordered 2 liquor drinks and our bill was $100...without the tip! I ordered a cheeseburger and 2 drinks for my husband one night (room service) and it was $30...without a tip. If you order room service, just order the food if you want a soda. It's $4 for a soda in the fridge, but $5-6 for the same soda on room service. The next morning we ate breakfast and it was just under $100 because we kept it at coffee and juice this time. Valet. Be warned that if you park your vehicle there it is $7 a day or $20 overnight fee. So if you're staying for three nights, you are paying $60 upon check-out. This is whether or not you are a guest! Dragonfly Lounge/Night Life. The night life is popping on Fridays and Saturday nights! They have a DJ and it's really cool and fun. If you are a guest, enter the club through the roped off area in the main lobby area. Show them your card and you're in. Otherwise, you will be waiting in a LONG line outside to get in where non-guests are, and trust me, there is a lot of people who want to get in this place! The Dragonfly Lounge area is outside and VERY small. They pack people in pretty tight, so be careful not to fall into the pool! There is one bar, but the bar is only 5 ft. long, so if you want a drink (as a guest) get your drinks inside. There are doormen outside each door to go inside and will stop everyone who does not have a room key. So it's not as crowded inside or noisy. Plus you can relax and socialize at the bar or at the tables. I noticed on Friday and Saturday night there were security guards on the 4th floor when I was going back to my room. I'm not sure if this is on every floor on those nights, but it makes you feel a little safer that random people aren't going to be walking through the hallways, hopefully. Hint: If you aren't 21 then don't stay here. We saw so many people guests and non-guests getting denied at the door because they weren't of age. And they were not shy about denying people. A lot of people were denied access. One girl made a scene because she was a guest and she couldn't get in. All and all this is a pretty swanky hotel. Although we could have received an awesome and larger suite at another 5 star hotel for the same price. Is it worth the extra money? Not really, in my opinion. Like I said, you can get a lot more and better for the same price at another 5 Star hotel/resort. We feel a little like we wasted money for nothing. And trust me, we have stayed at some top of the line hotels/resorts and we do not mind spending more money for nicer amenities, etc.. But we were not that impressed with this hotel.

My only complaint was that the coffee pot wasn't clean, there was still a left over substance in the martini mixer, and a martini glass wasn't clean. But I can get over that because I wasn't planning on making a martini or coffee. But there was a dishwasher in there if I wanted to clean it myself. There was also a washer and dryer, which was great for swimsuits after the pool. They even brought us complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries because of the \"inconvenience\". All this after upgrading us! We got in-room massages which were incredible as well. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. Service was always quick and on-time. They really did go above and beyond to make our one year anniversary special. It's something that we will never forget.

Needless to say, my guests were very impressed as we walked into the hotel lobby. Two headed into Dragonfly to order drinks while another and I made a stop at the restroom. My friend and I were stopped as we attempted to enter Dragonfly because he was wearing flipflops. We were informed that there was a no flipflop policy. What?. I can respect a dress code (on a side note...it is Dallas, Summer, still 90 degrees at 10pm) but he was wearing nice linen shorts and an Izod. I also felt that the delivery was a bit snobby and pretentious. I entered the restaurant to try to cancel the drinks but I was too late so we took the drinks to the hallway leading up to the restaurant. After sitting for a few minutes, we were informed that we could not stay or sit in the hallway area becuase 1 guest was wearing flipflops and that we would have to take our drinks to the hotel lobby. What? We remained respectful but voiced our complaint. As we were sitting in the lobby, we watched several young ladies enter the restaurant and bar, wearing flipflops. We inquired and were told very curtly that the no flipflop policy only applied to men, as directed by the hotel owner. What? We finished our drinks and left and I probably would not have had a problem except that the policy was not consistent and I still don't see how sitting in the lobby 30 feet from where we first sat really made a difference.

The odor smelled like someone just got through smoking pot in our room. The smell was so strong I asked the maids, who were down the hall claening rooms, to come in and spray our room with some deodorizer to help with the smell. It worked, but at the end of the night there was a little hint of it still left. Oh well, the room was still nice. I have to say I loved the turn down service that was provided. The maids came in, lite two candles and left salted cashews on my pillow. I'll take cashews over mints any day of the week!

I have to preface this review by mentioning that we are kind of hotel snobs. We are big fans of any Four Seasons or Aman resort but also like to stay at hip, fun places when possible (The Parker Palm Springs is a favorite). It is in that vein that we chose Zaza over more \"upscale hotels\" thinking we would get the best of both worlds- atmosphere and quality. I guess the atmosphere is fine- the decor is all you would expect it to be and the bar/ night club was PACKED on Saturday night. That all being said, I would categorize the hotel's style as more wanna be trendy than chic and what you get in decor you loose in service and cleanliness. The staff were all very nice but just not well trained or efficient. For instance, when we checked in, there were 2 bellmen waiting in the lobby not helping anyone yet neither followed us up to our room with our luggage. We had to wait 15 minutes and then call down to the front desk to get our bags delivered. Also, just after checking in, an employee came into our room without knocking to check that the room was ready for the next guests (us!!). She apparently had not been informed we already had checked in. Turn down service also missed our room for some reason. When I called down to housekeeping after returning to my room at 11pm, they quickly came and made up the room, however, it was frustrating to have to call. All of this could be forgiven however were it not for the lack of cleanliness in the room. The pillow cases were stained, the curtains were stained and WORST of all, i went to wash my face with a new towel housekeeping had just brought me and there was a big brown stain on it. I am willing to sacrifice elements of service for a fun boutique experience but dirty rooms and towels are unacceptable in my book. I would not stay here again. PROS: Lively bar scene. theme rooms.

I was coming back from Cancun (stayed at the Fiesta American Grand Coral Beach which was great). I was staying 2 nights before flying back home to Buenos Aires. I know Dallas very well as I formally lived in Dallas before moving to South America. Before flying to Cancun, I stayed at the Nylo in Plano which was nice. I posted a review of that stay as well. First of all, the location is really great and it's very close to downtown. Nothing really to do downtown but this area is in a very central location and close to both 75 Highway and also the Tollway so it's easy to get around. The lobby is very nice. I tried booking directly on their website but the reservation section wasn't working so I booked off of Expedia.com. I booked a suite and the rate with tax was about $250 per night. We checked in late afternoon and they had everything ready. It literally took just 3 minutes to swipe my credit card and they gave my keys to the room. I got in and both my fiance and I were really impressed with the rooms. I'm in the real estate and hospitality business so I do a LOT of furnishing of rental properties. I could see they spent some money on the finish out and furniture. The room itself was very spacious with high ceilings. It had a VERY comfortable king size bed and it had a HD LCD 42' inch TV which was very nice. it had a work desk with both wi-fi and cord complimentary Internet but service was very spotty for the 2 nights/3 days that we were there. It worked but the connection kept cutting off. I was impressed as the desk chair was VERY nice and comfortable. The bathroom was nice as well with marble countertops. Good size. The first night we were on the 2nd floor and the room was VERY noisy with the wind. It was very windy and we couldn't sleep as there was a loud whislting of the wind against the window. We thought maybe it was just this room. In the morning we asked to move to another room because of the noise. They were sold out but they said that at noon they would have another room. I told them we would pack our bags and they could move them. We went out and about doing lots of shopping and met up with a friend and they did indeed change our room and moved our bags. They moved us to the 3rd floor. That night there was still some noise with the wind and the windows but not as bad. I'm not sure if it was just this side of the building but there was lots of wind noise whistling into the room. Really that was the only complaint I had about the room. Keep in mind they do NOT have a parking lot to park your rental car. Dallas is one of those cities with very few taxis so you probably will rent a car. Note that they don't have a lot and only valet. The valet guys were very good. Of course you should tip them each time they bring your car. The hotel also charges you $18 per night for the valet car parking so note this. At the check-out everything was ok but we noted that they had an incorrect $78 for breakfast in the restaurant. We never went to the restaurant and in fact, had room service that same day. We pointed it out and they quickly took it off our bill. I'd suggest you review your bill in detail. Really, I was impressed with the hotel. Great staff and everyone was friendly. The location was very good and central and the size of the room was very nice. Nice LCD TV, nice desk with very upscale and comfortable chair, nice bathrooms and nice furniture.

I decided to book a concept suite (they have several and many were available just days before my stay including: Shagadelic, Art, Far East, Out of Africa, East Indies, and Texas) to make the night even more special. We stayed in a balcony room on our first visit and loved it so I figured a concept suite (which costs almost twice as much) would be even better. When we stayed last year in the balcony room I enjoyed the music from Club Oasis (I do understand why other reviewers have complained about it, but for us it was like being inside a club all night- we kept the balcony doors open and went to sleep listening to the music.) I had originally booked the West Indies Suite as it has a balcony that overlooks the pool area but when I discovered that snow was in the forecast for the weekend (snow in Texas in April? Who would have thought\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) I decided to change my reservation to the Bohemian Suite as it seemed cozier. The suite itself is beautiful with Antique furniture and interesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bohemian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd art. There are several art books scattered throughout the room for guests to leisurely flip through. The bedroom area is elevated and a very interesting railing separates it from the living area. The room seems to be filled with fluffy pillows that made it seem even more luxurious. The bathroom, however, was a disappointment. The bathtub is small, there is only one sink, and there is no separate shower. I liked the d\u00c3\u00a9cor but expected more for the $515 price tag. The hotel itself is a lot of fun, eclectic without taking itself too seriously. I think my parents would find it silly, maybe even too strange, but for me it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual without sacrificing beauty. There is artwork and photographs throughout the hotel that make you pause and think. The corridor leading from the lobby to Dragonfly, the hotel restaurant, has a lot of seating that allows you to just relax and take in the music without having to enter the club area. The hotel is fairly small with approximately 150 rooms and suites on only 4 floors. The pool area and the balcony rooms offer fabulous views of downtown Dallas but the view from The Bohemian Suite, unfortunately, was on the other side and included some apartments and a dumpster, prompting us to keep the blinds closed the entire stay. The windows on any of the rooms that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include balconies are pretty small so if you want an open feel and a view make sure to get a balcony. I did peek in at one of the standard rooms and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is nice, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing the bathrooms in those rooms are probably aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything special since the ones in the upgraded rooms are underpar. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that the service at ZaZa is poor by any means but many of the employees do seem disinterested, especially those at the reception desk and at the entrance to the restaurant. The valet staff and wait staff at Dragonfly, however, are exceptionally helpful and friendly. I called reservations multiple times while trying to choose a room and found that I was always treated well on the phone and all of my questions were answered. Prior to our visit I tried to e-mail the concierge in order to make special arrangements for celebrating our anniversary and only received an automated reply that did not address my request. We enjoyed our meals at Dragonfly as always. I had the Tandori Prawns while my husband had the Ginger Wagyu Beef, both were wonderful. The cocktails are pricey ($12-$17) but good, the Peach Bellini in particular was very tasty. Breakfast was complimentary (sort of, the concept suite includes a $30 voucher for breakfast.) I had the steak and eggs while my husband got the Spinach \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bennies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We both got bottomless mimosas and our glasses were refilled every couple of minutes it seemed. We had a minor problem at checkout when we discovered that we had been charged $18 for valet parking. According to the website valet parking is complimentary when you book a concept suite. The woman at the reception desk initially didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to credit us for the valet parking and asked if we had booked the room online (concept suites can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be booked online, only over the phone) but since we had printed out everything the website said about the concept suites she relented. I was also charged for valet parking during my last stay even though the package I had booked was supposed to include it, so I always make sure to check my invoice before I leave. Overall I did not feel that it was worth it to stay in a concept suite, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel I received any additional perks and would have been just as happy staying in a balcony room (I received a phone call from the hotel manager in response to a survey I completed after my stay and he said that he noted that I didn't feel that the suite was worth the extra money and he said that they want to see what they can do on my next stay to make up for it- I thought that was nice that he reads the guests comments. ) Next time I will try to stay when the weather is warmer and I can sit on my balcony sipping wine as the club music in pumping.

Not so comfortable when there's more than you and a friend standing in there.

Apparently every Friday and Saturday nite, that area turns into a little \"nightclub\" type scene complete with a DJ and booming PA system (all under a tent). If you plan on staying either of those nights during the week, be aware of the whereabouts of your room and whether it overlooks the courtyard or not. Unless you have no problem with the annoying, throbbing \"oonst oonst\" pulsing and blaring through the walls and windows at 1AM while you're just trying to get some good ol shut-eye.
