The advantages were that it was central and close to a metro station. The room we had, No 5 was by to the reception area and we could hear the TV in the reception area and the telephone when it rang. There were creaky floorboards. however the room was in good decorative order. The shower looked a bit tired with the grout between the tiles falling out. Never managed to get the TV to work. As the room overlooked the Grand Via it was very noisy, commencing in the early hours of the morning. This disturbed our sleep. If one wants a quiet and peaceful night, this hotel is not for you. The staff were helpful and pleasant but English appeared to be a problem. The price was very good considering it is in Madrid and in a central location.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cgood choice\u201d", "Author": "donaldgregoryBelfast", "ReviewID": "UR66848103", "Content": "I was passing through Madrid and a friend recommended this hotel for my one night.

Traffic noise and sounds from neighbouring rooms and creaking floorboards made sleep difficult. TV remote did not work, bed lamp did not work, door keys were a big hassle, bathroom shower space required a contortionist to fit in. You can't get into the lift with more than one suitcase. Eerie noise from flush. Room and bed and bathroom very clean but. Owner/manager not scary or rude like some others have commented, but very matter-of-fact. Don't expect a smile. Great location though. 1 min from Santo Domingo metro, and also a few mins from Plaza Espana, Gran Via and Callao, connecting you to pretty much all subway lines. All threates are close by, hundreds of restaurants on Gran Via and neighbourhood, walking distance from many of the top sights. So if you stay here at this price you know that you have to sacrifice on other things, which is pretty much everything. But what a grand building. I will add a photo later. Crying shame what they have done to the inside.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "yorkshire england", "Title": "\u201cgood location but beware\u201d", "Author": "happyhols3", "ReviewID": "UR16485024", "Content": "alcazar regis in madrid is in a prime location on main grand via so expect some traffic noise but it is within walking distance to all sights and also very easy to get to and from the airport using metro but a beautiful building has been spoilt in the refurb the large rooms are divided very poorly into 2 rooms so the nice plasterwook is cut in 1/2 and arch doors are 1/2 your room 1/2 neighbours resulting in every single sound been heard as if there in the same room including conversation and even cans opened but mainly creaking floorboard when next door move about and the toilets are so noisy as they have electric shredders inside so no chance of sleep if they are flushed . the doors open with tiny lock like a wardrobe one and once inside you need a small hand to reach the small bathroom type bolt that is your lock it never felt very secure but we had no problems it is clean but another downfall is the staff speak no english at all and this made paying bill q about keys a very long job. i think there are better places for this price in madrid . photo of lobby correct you can see doors here but dinning room no longer there and i never saw a bedroom like this photo", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cAt $46 double the Alcazar was great!\u201d", "Author": "Maricuyita", "ReviewID": "UR2291650", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed in the Alcazar for 3 nights in June. At $46 for a double the Alcazar was a great bargain. The lady in charge was very nice and helpful. The location is very convenient. The rooms are very modest but that was all we needed at the time. Our room had a balcony facing La Gran Via (main street), on the 6th floor but it wasn't noisy, it was pretty clean, and nothing fancy but a good value. The Hostal Buenos Aires is located one floor below and the double went for $59 but the guy at the front desk was not nice, friends that stayed there complained that the service was not good, so we decided to try the Hostal on the next floor, which happened to be the Alcazar & we're happy we made that choice.", "Date": "July 12, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hostal Alcazar Regis", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d239046-Reviews-Hostal_Alcazar_Regis-Madrid.html", "Price": "$43 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Gran Via 61-5</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28013</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "239046", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3e/3c/3e3cc63698b097a5b2b98df08320f4c81large.jpg"}}
