The location is very convient if you are travelling into rome from the airport by train as it is approx 3 mins walk from the station. Check in was very easy , staff very friendly and made us feel very welcome providing us with a map and pointing out the location of the hotel. We stayed in a corner room on 3rd floor so had 2 windows in our room each on a different street, was a little noisy if u had the windows open in the morning but not so much at night. We ate the first night in pizza familglia on the side street next to the hotel. This place was ok but the service left a little to be desired , we were served our food very quickly we were in and out in about 35 mins .. We prefer to savor a meal and take our time and a smile costs nothing either. 2nd night we ate in an italian approx 1 min walk twrds the station this was very nice and staff were friendly (even gave me a glass of vino on the house at the end of the meal). 3rd night we took a taxi (which reception kindly called for us) to the pantheon which was \u20ac9 and ate in one of the many resturants down the side streets near the pantheon. We then saved just enough room and visited della palma ice cream and chocolate shop. This shop is an ice cream lovers dream many many flavors to choose from and will cost \u20ac4 for a chocolate cone with 3 scoops ... very reasonable prices as we paid \u20ac5 for an ice cream not nearly as nice near the spanish steps.

The hotel is located just a few blocks from Roma Termini, along the Via Volturna, though you\u2019ll need to look carefully to find it. There is no large sign above the building, just two small gold colored plaques on the wall. It\u2019s an easy walk, even if you have a lot of luggage. Once you\u2019ve dumped that luggage off, you are right around the corner from several decent restaurants and a couple of nice churches, including the Santa Maria Vittoria, the one with Bernini\u2019s St. Teresa sculpture. The Termini Metro stop is at Roma Termini, so you are very close to the Metro too. A couple of stops from that is the Colosseum and a few more on another line is Vatican City. The second great part about this hotel is the breakfast. This is no skimpy breakfast, but a full buffet, which will prepare you well for touring the city. Finally, the staff is excellent. All speak English, some exceptionally so. They were great at recommending places to visit. Our rate was reasonable, 100 Euros for a triple, but that was in low season. There are a few negatives, one being the size of the rooms, they are definitely on the smallish side, though the bathrooms are large. The wood tile floor in ours had some water damage at some point in the past, so it was loose and peeling in a few places. It would be nice if they got around to fixing that. Other than that, this hotel is good to come home to after a long day running around Rome.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porvoo, Finland", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel with low price, good location\u201d", "Author": "Delenna", "ReviewID": "UR124794908", "Content": "I & my husband spent 3 nights in Eurostars Domus Aurea in Rome.

The bed was so big there wasn't much room left but it was totally fine for us. There was a closet, table, tv and mini-bar. In the closet there's a safe - you get the key from the front desk by paying a 20 euro deposit (which was returned when we returned the key). There was a heating system which worked even we were there when it snowed for the first time in 27 years :) After we returned from a day in the city the air was a bit damp though but that was fixed with keeping the window open for a few minutes. Breakfast was served on the 6th floor with a view over the rooftops. The breakfast was simple buut there was enough choises. The hot chocolate is really awesome - it's like melted chocolate, nothing like we get in Finland (here it's water/milk based thin liquid).

This smallish hotel is very well situated to the Roma Termini station; just exit the right side entrance, and turn left and walk along Via Marsala - after the crossing, it's Via Volturno. Less than 10 minute walk. The moment we stepped into the lobby, we were warmly welcome by the receptionist (Flamina) who spoke excellent English, was courteous, friendly, quick and extremely efficient. We requested to put our passports in the reception safe and store our bag whilst we got back to the station to get on the trambus for a quick orientation of Rome. She gave us a receipt for both items, a brochure and a map and marked the hotel location, without being asked. She also asked if we wanted twin beds as we had booked a double, so thoughtful! The room itself was quiet, super clean (great cleaning staff who were also very courteous ), adequate (we did not find it too small, but then we are not big size or overweight), and had a nice shower, bidet, towels and all accessories. However there was one big drawback - our room was very stuffy, the air conditioner seemed to just be blowing dry air, no matter how we adjusted the controls. Eventually we had to get up from bed and open the windows - immediately the street noise and air pollution got into the room, so we left the windows slightly ajar. My bed also creaked at the slightest movement but not my daughter's - this wasn't a big problem as I am a quiet sleeper. I would rate the hotel Excellent if not for this. If there's one thing that the staff themselves can improve on, it would be that they try to be as knowledgeable about other products besides the ones they are promoting, e.g. Open 110 trambus which was great value for money as it was only 25 Euros for 72 hours for both the green country as well as the red city tour buses. It was also the last Sunday of the month the following day which means that the Vatican museums were free which we found out when we got there, if this wast mentioned when I requested for information about visiting the Vatican, it would just be fabulous. So, great staff who are a credit to the hotel and good, clean facilities.

The location of the hotel is great, its about 200m from the Termini Station so it's perfect to get around. All the major attractions of Rome are within a 10/15 mins walk from the hotel. We walked everywhere which is the best way to see Rome, however make sure you take a good pair of walking shoes as your feet will hurt otherwise! The rooms are quite small but they are very clean and tidy - which is all you need really. Plus if your going to Rome your not going to be spending much time in your room other than sleeping so it doesn't matter if it's small. The beds are very comfy which is great after a long day sightseeing, however the walls are quite thin so you can hear a lot of noise from the other guests. The breakfast is good but make sure you get there early so you can have hot fresh food. They also provided a gluten free breakfast for my husband due to his allergies, which was excellent. If you have to follow a gluten free diet then you'll be fine in Rome as most restaurants are aware of it and some even provide gluten free pasta. Just make sure you ask. We visited all the major attractions whilst we were in Rome, and here's a few tips from what we learnt: 1) The Vatican Museums - it will cost about 12 euro each if you do this yourself, but it's well worth it to get a guided tour. This will cost about 40 euro each and you'll need to make sure you get a good tour guide. Also we found out that on the last Sunday of every month it's free to get in. You can also go to the top of St Peters Basilica for an extra 5 euro each. 2) Colussem & Roman Forum - it will cost about 12 euro each if you do it this yourself and about 25 euro each if you get a guided tour. I don't think it's worth having a guided tour here though. 3) All the other attractions are free so you can take your time exploring these.

The hotel is situated rigt in the heart of Rome and close to all forms of transport, In fact as we looked out of our window (3rd. floor) we could see the main metro station and tour buses. the staff at this hotel were extremely helpful and no inquiry was too much for them to answer. Because we were on a budget we booked a basic double room which were on the small side but extremely clean and well kept. The Breakfast room is situated on the rooftop which gives you a panoramic view of the city. Breakfast was very nice with a few choices, but get there early if you want something hot, our usual time was 8am. We had decided on a five night stay which gave us plenty of time at our own leisure to see all we had hoped to see. We also booked the hop on - hop off tour bus 18 euros each for two days which initally helped us to get our heads around the location of all the historic sites(some are within walking distance of the hotel) after that it was second nature Why take a bus you ask? In August it is VERY hot and having left the hotel for our little exploration the heat became unbearable within ten minutes. Be wary of some of the guides who will charge you a small forune to escort you, and in the end you are rushed around the site and you may not see all you want. My wife and I bought two guide books with pictures and information included and spent a half day at athe Colosseum alone. So with a packed lunch and we did it all at our own pace. I would certainly go back to this hotel as it was quite adequate to all our needs. The only complaint is we had to leave at the end of our stay.

Familia was a nice family owned restauarant with fresh food, good vino and very affordable. Our room was on the 1st floor and overlooked the main street. With the window open it was very noisy but the closed window kept out the street noise. We had two twin beds that were the most comfortable of all the hotels we had stayed previously. The room was small by US standards but was fine for us. There was not a dresser to put our clothes, just a small closet....but not enough hangers. Our bathroom was quite large and roomy. The shower could have easily been twice the size. It was about 3' square and had a vinyl shower curtain instead of a glass door. The breakfast was served on the roof and was probably the most ample of all the hotels we had stayed at. A nice selection of both European and American fare. I would say that the quality of the food was not as good (a lot of pre-packaged stuff) as other hotels but certainly a big variety.

We did our homework, so we knew the Termini was just 2 blocks from the hotel.....What we didn't realise was that where the train from the airport offloads, is quite some distance from the main area. We took the nearest exit and could not get our bearings, even with a map. There were roadworks preventing us from crossing the road and we had large cases...so we ended up taking a taxi which took us the scenic route and charged 18 euros! Later we realised our error. In retrospect, if we'd walked about 200 metres down the platform, we would have reached the main shopping area of the termini. Basically then all we needed do was wa lk out of the main doors, turn right and walk alongside the fence until we reached the road, then cross 2 small roads... 5 minutes to the hotel. We arrived hot and sticky, into a marble reception area , with a smiling, welcoming receptionist.. Our air conditioned room was most welcome. Granted, as said by others, rooms were not large, but it was adequately sized , with a compact marble bathroom with all the basic amenities, and spotlessly clean with stylish decor. I would say this hotel is wonderful value for money. Especially given it's location. The only down points I would state are...... The breakfast was usually cold - We arrived for breakfast between 8.30 and 9am, and apart from the first day, the scrambled egg was always cold. Maybe we needed to be a bit earlier off the mark eh. Have to say the coffee was wonderful.. yummmm. The only other fault I'd say , was relating to the tiny wardrobe. Too narrow to hang clothing properly.....but we managed by only hanging longer easily creased items, and leaving the remainder in out suitcase. Not a problem at all for the few days we were there. Staff were very freindly and pleasant. When I return to Rome ( tossed my coin in the Trevi Fountain), I shall stay there again. Brilliant Metro system. It's basically 2 lines which cross at Termini. It seems you can travel almost anywhere for 1 euro. ( For 1 euro you can travel for 75 minutes) From Termini, its 2 stops to Spagna for the Spanish steps. ( I think it's one stop for the Trevi fountain. 5 stops takes you to the Colleuseum. Most days our excursions began at Termini or at Republica stations. Purchase your 1 euro ticket from the ticket machine ( and make sure you get it time/ date stamped at the machine nearby or its a \u00a35 euro fine). When you visit the Colluseum or Vatican don't be sucked in by people offering guided tours at top notch prices. All around the Vatican were tour guides. One British guide tried to persuade us to pay 35 euros each for the Vatican museum. The cost to do it alone, including an audio guide was something like 14 euros. Similarly at the colluseum, they offer a guided tour whereby you bypass the que, and the cost is more than double the cost to go it alone. As for bypassing the que... those who paid for a tour guide still qued but joined a fast moving que for those hiring the audio guide! We were in the same que, and pretty much walked straight in.

Or any liquor for that matter! When you go into little shops you will pay twice as much for wine that is just as good as what you can buy in the grocery stores (which are not hard to find just ask in the hotel!).

We were also around the corner from the La Famiglia Restaurant which served great food and wine, very reasonable prices and quick service!", "Date": "June 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cdismal\u201d", "Author": "traveldawg", "ReviewID": "UR4694865", "Content": "After the positive reviews for this hotel, I was shocked by my experience there. I checked in to a beautiful lobby, thinking I had made a smart choice. But when I got to the room, I could tell it had no connection to the lobby. I had been travelling Europe for two months, so I was used to small rooms. This one was not only dark and dingy, but was way beyond small. It truly was just about a foot larger than the bed on each side. The bed linens were threadbare, but the room felt a little better when i opened the curtains. The bathroom seemed clean. I was travelling throughout Europe for a couple months and had to make sure that I booked hotels that had internet connections so that I could work. Domus Aurea's site emphasized in all caps that it had wifi service. When I couldn't find a connection I called the desk, only to be told that it wasn't working, but I might want to try the computer in their lobby. That one didn't have any connection either. The desk clerk sent me down the street to an internet point, where I proceeded to book another hotel, because I could not work without a connection to the net. I came back and checked out, figuring the sooner I vacated the room the better. The clerk knew why I was checking out, but insisted that he had to charge me for the entire time that I had booked. No compensation or consideration or even a reduced rate of any kind. Not even an apology that they couldnt offer what they advertised. I understand that I had made the reservation; though on the other hand, the hotel could not provide what I reserved. The lack of consideration or even any kind of apology at all hardly seems like a sign of good service. Four hotels later I ended up with a great room at a cheaper rate at XX Settembre Hotel - one of the positive suprises of my travels. I highly recommend investigating it if you are looking for a hotel in the range and location of the Domus Aurea. The Domus Aurea seems to be an okay hotel, but there are several other nicer ones for the same price in the area worth investigating if you're looking to be near the Termini area of Rome.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood base for a low-cost stay\u201d", "Author": "itinerantnomad", "ReviewID": "UR4450358", "Content": "This property came up at quite a reasonable price compared to other properties in Rome. I was sceptical, so read the other earlier reviews and decided to go for it. I agree with the earlier reviewers. While my room was very small, it was clean. Breakfast on the covered roof terrace was good (cereal, cold meat, cheese, bread, hard boiled eggs, etc), though I really disliked the fact they had a NESCAFE coffee machine instead of real coffee! Ugh. I had just juice or water at breakfast, and went downstairs to a little cafe for my morning cappucino instead. I also learned quickly that Republicca station on Line A to the south and P Clinico station to the north on Line B, each only 5 minutes walk, were much nicer than the slightly grubby area around Termini.", "Date": "February 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat deal at Hotel Domus Aurea\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4332236", "Content": "This is a three-star hotel which was closer to the train station and at the same price as a two-star hotel we had been staying at. The breakfast was massive and the staff very welcoming. It was 79 euros per night including a huge buffet breakfast, tea, coffee, two types of yoghurt, 4 types of bread, bacon, parma ham, cold cut meat and cheeses, cereals, fruit, eggs, mini sausages. Served on a rooftop terrace. Rooms were med/small, mattress soft but old--could make out the location of individual springs, but no prob sleeping on it. The cheesy headboard and wardrobe were painted torquoise with \"romanesque\" wave pattern carved out. However, the bathroom was very contemporary with glass and stainless steel fixtures, marble sink-top and marble inlay floor as well as white marble walls. Shampoo, soap, showercap, shower cream, toothpaste and toothbrush, and two thick towels await you. It had good water pressure and the temperature was just right. it was a bit noisy just outside the room--staff always seemed to be vacuuming and we could hear the other guests coming and going. TV and minibar. Windows shut-out the sound from the street very effectively. Helpful staff let you leave excess luggage before or after our stay and didn't charge. They also went to great length to help us confirm our flight home. They also recommended an excellent restaurant with remarkable value for money, and gave us a business card for 10% off. Local small food store across street and up a block for days when you want to do a packed lunch.

The hotel was small, clean and well presented. The staff, although quiet, were friendly and helpful when asked. The room is indeed small, although this was no problem to us, and the combination of marble and wood is pleasing on the eye. The bathroom was again small, but spotlessly clean. One particular highlight is the buffet breakfast, served on a partially covered roof terrace. The quality of the food provided is very good, including scrambled egg and bacon, and you can eat as much (or as little) as you like. Location-wise, the hotel is very close to the Termini railway station, the central bus station and the Metro. It is not the most pleasant of areas at night, but neither was it particularly threatening. There were some problems, but they were minimal - the tv didn't work after the first night, and the hot water supply was a bit erratic. Given the excellent value, these niggles were hardly important. If you want somewhere comfortable and simple to stay in Rome and arent too bothered about having lots of space, then I would strongly recommend the Domus Aurea", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta GA", "Title": "\u201cTwo Happy Visitors\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3242561", "Content": "We spent 6 happy nights at the Domus Aurea.
