Not so good if you are in Rome as a tourist, because the Metro is too far to walk. The hotel is 1.5 km outside the GRA ring road that surrounds Rome. The rooms are clean, light and modern. There is a nice patio from which to watch the sunset and with binoculars (or a zoom lens) you can make out St Peter's dome 10km away. The breakfast room is spacious, new and the choice of food is what you'd expect of a business hotel. Wifi is free. Parking is free. Bring your own iron - the rooms don't have their own and the hotel's was broken when I was there. Restaurants in the area are limited but a popular family run Napolitan restaurant (called Re Basilico) is right next door.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOC Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jazzrab", "ReviewID": "UR118327987", "Content": "The good: very nice breakfast, lot of choice and and much quantity, free parking, very clean, very nice modern (yet stylish) room and toilet, great price, good A/C, polite staff, great price The bad: takes around one hour to get to the city center (or back) with public transport, my keycard stopped working 2 times, I was placed in a building which could only be accessed by an elevator (rather small, veeeeeeeery slow and veeeeery hot during the day), no exit by the stairs, much noise from the busy street (all day and night), one guy at the dinning room was unfriendly and made terrible coffee, wifi was average", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cVery modern clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "aripac", "ReviewID": "UR118168827", "Content": "Hotel was very clean and very uptodate.

The hotel is very nice, clean and modern. The staff were very kind. I must warn you though it is a bit out of Rome and might not be suitable for those without a car (we didn't check the public transport though. There might be bus/train stations nearby). Wireless Internet connection was free and quite fast. The rooms were modern and clean, although the bathroom in the room 110 seemed to be designed for disabled people which might be difficult to use for some people as the toilets were elevated. Overall we loved our stay there and recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Rome.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alkmaar, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat, but read\u201d", "Author": "pnblank", "ReviewID": "UR115187559", "Content": "There should be a GOOD rating between Average and Very Good. I had to vote Very Good because I couldn't choose Average. If it was possible, the rating would've been Good. We booked through Booking.com, so we got a good deal on a 4* hotel and we knew we'd get the room we'd paid for. That being said, although the room was small, it was good enough and we were pleased with it. Very comfortable bed and pillows, we slept like logs. The hotel is not in Rome, it's about 12km from the city, on the very, VERY busy Tiburtina Road. So, if you don't have a car, stay elsewhere because it's a bit far. If you do, it's perfect. There is a subway/metro station 3km away where you can park your car the whole day for 1,50\u20ac, and the subway ticket is 1\u20ac per trip. The subway takes you directly to the Coliseum, so right into the heart of it all. Breakfast: ok, but not for a 4* hotel. Besides, you have to chase Mr. Person in Charge of Breakfast for coffee or tea, because there is none in the room. Mr. Person in Charge of Breakfast is not very friendly or available, he will slam (yes, slam) the door shut at 10:30 so nobody else comes in. Unfortunately, he was only replaced on Sunday 3rd July by a much nicer, customer oriented lady we also saw at the reception desk. Wi-fi is provided free, which is a very nice plus. There is a very nice restaurant next door if you don't want to linger in Rome looking for a proper place to eat your dinner - Re Basilico.

In terms of surroundings, it is located in industrial area, no green areas around. On their website, they say they accept guests with dogs and dogs are allowed in free of charge. When making a booking, I indicated my additional comments about my dogs travelling with me, but apparently they did not take notice of that and were surprised to see me and dogs at check-in. They asked me to pay fees for the dogs.

It was not problem, They had available room, and gave us with no adittional payment. The hotel is new, everything is perfect and new(opened 3 months ago). The Bed was very confortable, enough good to feel like on the clouds :-).The sound-proof is perfect,too- no matter you sleep on the street side or on the garden side. The stuff is very kind, ready to help you in any time of day. Breakfast was delicious, like in any other good four-star hotel. But something was and better,too. They serve for breakfast rela italian espresso, capuccino and all other sort of coffees. It is very hard to find in other hotels. Also, do not forget to eat in their restaurant \"Il Basilico\", food is very good, fresh, and I recommend sea-food and pizza to eat there. Price is very reasonable, far cheaper than in the city. Internet is for free, and speed is very good. The parking is for free , too and there is enough place for all guests. Location - Yes, you are 15 km from the city center, but I had rent-a-car, so that was not problem for me. In the same street, 2km away form the Hotel is Metro Station Rebibia, and you are for 12 minutes in the heart of the city.
