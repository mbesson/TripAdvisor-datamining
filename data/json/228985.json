{"Reviews": [{"Content": "next to nowhere Fairly expensive but extremely clean and luxurious beds. Hard to find from the autostrada, and traffic queuing up for the nearby shopping mall can be bad. Nearby shoping mall I Gigli has a giant supermakret in it, which is useful. Plus a variety of good places to eat. Which brings me on to breakfast in the hotel - grey instant coffee was a real let-down. Surely it can't be that expensive to serve decent coffee in a \u9227?9 per night hotel?", "Date": "Apr 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR248275189", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "liveandletlive"}, {"Content": "A great hotel if you've rented a car. Free parking, free breakfast buffet, internet (39cents per minute), nice room, well equipped. The hotel is located in an industrial area in Campi just outside of Florence. The free parking and free breakfast were definitely a plus. The parking is in a underground garage, so it seemed quite safe. The problem I have found with hotels in Florence is there is a serious lack of parking. We stayed in Campi last time at a different hotel and found it quite convenient. It is a quick ten minutes into the city center. I would recommend it. It is located slightly behind a group of condos, so it might be hard to see at first glance. There is a large lit sign on the top of the building though.", "Date": "Dec 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR365068067", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "leisure_traveler06"}, {"Content": "Good price, good service Wonderfull, fully new infrastructure, good service, 3 star breakfast.The hotel is a little bit out of florence but we've found it very easy to reach by train. In a 500 meters walk from the hotel you'll find the calenzano station (very small) that puts you in florence center in 20 minutes. Very practical. There are lots of trains during the day except sundays. Ask the timetable in the reception. They do speak english here.The room is really big, nice and clean.The air conditioning didn't seem to work out very well. It was always very hot. Maybe it was me that could't handle it.I've found this hotel not very expensive for who wants to stay in florence.Besides, there's one of the biggest shopping malls in italy (igigli) in a 300 meters walk distance.

Took them 2 hours to change the sheets, but only after they came to the room to MAKE SURE there were indeed 4 or 5 hairs and crumbs in the bed and called 2 times to ask what the problem was with the bed! It was amazing. We had also requested, months in advance, a fold away sleeper cot for our child - that was not in the room when we arrived and took 3 hours to get. Definitely would NOT stay here again.Agree with the other review - it is in a very strange location - difficult to find.", "Date": "Jul 10, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR485670727", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "What's the point? Finding the place was a nightmare, but it was the lousy staff and surroundings that drove me over the edge. We were scheduled to stay 3 nights, but changed to a hotel in Florence after the first night. Make no mistake - this is a business hotel - that's why its cheaper to stay here on the weekend.

You can do sooooo much better than this hotel. It's definitely quite a drive to get to Florence and forget about getting directions from the staff or any bus info. We finally figured everything out on our own, but I wouldn't recommend driving around Florence as we found ourselves doing. If you want to see Florence, stay inside Florence and spend a buck or two more, really! Parking in the secure garage, isn't included as the other reviewer had said, it was 20 extra euros for our group. And yes, we supposedly had airconditioning, but it was so hot in our room. The breakfast was included, but the stafF was rude! I am not a hotel snob at all, but this place was no good. Stay in a bed and breakfast somewhere and you'll be much happier for nearly the same price.

It appears several 3 and 4 star hotels are in the area, and the area is still being developed, but is an unattractive industrial area. Our room was furnished well but had several quirks. The hotel must have an elaborate energy saving package because air conditioning is limited to 3pm to midnight and also has a timer that limits the time the air conditioning runs to about 30 minutes unless reset by the user. That can make for a very warm night of sleeping! The window has a metal blind that lowers to seal in the room but it can be raised manually to allow air in when the air conditioning is not cooling the room. The hotel's breakfast is full American style but leaves much to be desired in quality. Parking is free in a secure garage. The hotel staff is outstanding and very attentive. The cost was 89 euros/nt for a cancellable reservation.", "Date": "May 29, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR725792611", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in /
