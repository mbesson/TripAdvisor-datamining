We travelled from San Fran to L.A via bus and caught a quick 15 minute cab ($13- incl tip) from Union to LAAC. We were given the keys to our room and directions to the facilities within the Athletic Club and Hotel. Pros: - tasteful very masculine decor fitting in with the old world feel of the hotel itself. Think dark woods, lithographs of 1920's men doing ridiculous poses and bronze statues decorating the hallways and common areas. - amazingly large room. For the price that we were paying my husband and I were impressed with the rooms space. Yes it is a bit dark but it was furnished with leather and had 8 different lights to utilize. - free WiFi. With owning an iPad it was really easy to see suggestions for meals and activities to participate in -comfortable bed with beautiful linen. I might sound overly female about this but the bed (King Size Suite) was AMAZING. The blankets were heavy and warm and the pillows were down. - breakfast buffet was delish. I don't eat eggs but it was a protein lovers delight! - facilities were top class. Basketball conditioning classes, Swedish massage and a full pool in downtown la is a sight to baffle you. I forgot my suit at home so needed to buy one. The staff at the pool were friendly and helpful and I paid for a speedo suit much cheaper than I would've at home- and this was at hotel prices! Cons: - It does get deserted at night and the homeless will follow you into TA food stores (chipotle/subway). Heads down and don't engage with them and you won't find it a problem. It looks a bit eerie outside at nighttime but we caught the metro and walked to our hotel and didn't have a problem. Common sense goes a long way. - some staff do look a bit disinterested and otherwise occupied. However. Be approachable and they will happily answer your questions. Be surly and a pain in the bum and of course you'll have problems.

It had been a major reason for the stay, (along with the location near The Orpheum Theater) so that was disappointing. However pool overhaul should be completed by now and it is huge.

There are amazing neighborhoods close by, and we felt very comfortable walking during the day. It was our first stay in LA and the LAAC upgraded our 4 night stay. We ended up in the UCLA Bruins suite for $178 a night. Free breakfast was included for both of us. Breakfast was a full buffet...amazing. We also had a 4 day pass to the athletic facilities, which were beautiful. The service was wonderful. The hotel is small enough so that employees recognize you, and they were all very kind. I was very impressed how comfortable I was. Our room was very quiet and clean. The halls have a lot of room for sitting and gathering. Overall I couldn't have been more happy with our stay. Also hats off to the front desk staff that helped us check in and out in the middle of the night. So friendly for 3 am.

With an AARP or similar discount, the value is amazing. It's in the heart of downtown, and easy walking to many restaurants, clubs, etc. The only downside is that the neighborhood gets pretty deserted after dark, and if you arrive in the evening there's not much open in the surrounding blocks: slightly eerie to walk around at night by yourself in an urban ghost town.

The interior was pretty nice, but the room was very moldy and the air was 'heavy', which exacerbated my sinus problem. The breakfast was included, but they didn't allow me to carry out a banana which I was trying to save for an afternoon snack because it was 'against their policy' (as if the customers would know about this). This stinginess continued on with the room service. They didn't have toothpaste in the room so I called the front desk. The guy who answered told me that the toothpaste tube they had was too small and 'only good enough for one brushing' and then asked me whether I still wanted it or not. This made me feel that they didn't even want to give me that small amount of toothpaste. So I went out and bought a $1 tube from the pharmacy nearby. The maid service was another interesting thing. I saw that their carts didn't have many extra towels, which made me think that there weren't a lot of customers on my floor. But then I realized that they were recycling the old towels (the ones that I put on the floor after using). This was subtly done as they were folded and hung again as if new. I have no problem reusing old towels, but the hotel again seemed to have forgotten to inform me of this 'policy'. Had I known, I wouldn't have placed the towels on the floor after using them. And finally, they NEVER refilled the basic room amenities such as shampoo, conditioner and body soap for the entire 4 days I stayed there. By the last night, I had only 1/5 of the shampoo left in the 1.5 oz bottle, but I felt too tired to deal with these people by that point that I just added water to the bottle to make enough bubbles to lather my hair.

I arrived at 3pm check-in with the idea that I'd work out, swim and enjoy the pool while my husband would meet with me later. Be warned: MAJORITY of the rooms are ADJOINING. Immediately upon entering my room, I was disturbed by the blaring of the neighbors tv. I phoned the front desk requesting a non adjoining room. I was assured no one was in the next door room. Yet, immediately after I got off the phone, I could hear the phone ringing next door. Why call if no one is there? I intercepted the worker who went into the room to turn off the tv, and he said my neighbor was 'out' and had left the tv on. I again requested of the front desk I would prefer a non-adjoining room. After a 15 minute wait, the staff member showed me to another room...only this one had a queen bed and btw, was still ADJOINING. So instead of accommodating my request, I was put in the same type of room with a smaller bed \u2013 I don\u2019t get it. After waiting 20 minutes for the worker to return with the second room key (he had taken my orig keys, and not given me the second room keys), I carried my luggage all the way down back to the front desk, and asked to speak the manager (Alberto.) He waved me over and proceded to tell me their rooms were \u2018mostly\u2019 adjoining. I mentioned again that I would like a non-adjoining bed with a KING bed not queen \u2013 which is what we had paid for... I was firm but polite. HE asked me if I had trouble sleeping or was a light sleeper? Actually, when I choose a hotel, I prefer NOT to hear the goings-on of my fellow hotel guests. I don't think I'm alone in this preference. He left me standing there for another 10 minutes without talking to me or telling me he was trying to accommodate me. After clearing my throat several times to get noticed, I finally managed to get his attention. He begrudgingly said he could put me in another room, but that it would need cleaning. And I would have to wait for another 35 minutes. Fine. I didn't care at this point. Just a clean room, with a king size bed where I can't hear my neighbors phone ring. After I mentioned I would go to the gym, and come back for a key for my husband Alberto asked \"Where is your husband, anyway.\" ??? The implication and tone was that I was 1) inept, 2) a woman and 3) not worth dealing with. I was embarrassed and ashamed, and I have rarely felt more discriminated against and invalidated than in that moment. Now, to be fair, I have a different last name then my husband - so maybe he thought I was an escort or having an affair? By this point, it's 4:50, I'm in street clothes in the lobby, and the gym and pool close at 5:30! On a Saturday! So, if you are going for a swim or workout, be forewarned. For a club based around fitness, they have terrible weekend hours \u2013 hotels.com stated that there is no room service on weekends, but not the early gym closures. My husband managed to speak to the GM, who apologized for the mishaps, put us in a suite, and sent us a bottle of champagne, but I can't help but feel that the GM is responsible for the lack of skill and customer service of the staff. I would not pay to stay here again. The lobby and elevators were worn and dirty. The rooms themselves were clean, but in all three rooms I saw, mildew and mold were evident on the ceiling tiles in the bathrooms. I have also never seen a pool in more need of a re-grouting.

I didn't expect much, actually, but WOW this place is a treasure in downtown LA! What was great: The room was clean, didn't smell of disinfectant, was reasonably soundproof for an old building, was decorated nicely in a old-school elegance style. The bed was firm, the bathroom was functional and clean, and the air conditioning worked well. There was a coffee maker, microwave, and refrigerator, along with plenty of drawers, nice furniture, and a decent-sized closet. The lights were decent--not too bright, yet enough. A nice flat-screen TV and an ipod-docking clock radio rounded out the amenities (though we didn't find the time to watch any TV :^) A fruit and cheese plate was delivered in the evening, and housekeeping was nice and responsive. The best part of this place is that it's an athletic club first and a hotel second. This is the original health and fitness club in LA, the only place the elite went back in the day, before a health club was on every corner--and it shows. It's a beautiful facility with everything you could want. My wife and I spent several hours lifting, running, swimming laps in the 25-yard indoor pool, spending relaxing time in the sauna and steam room (men's and women's separate in the locker rooms, but really clean and well maintained). The equipment was top-drawer. The attendants and trainers were friendly and helpful. This is the best fitness center I've been to in a long time--it's nearly a high-end spa. Cons: Really, nothing at all, other than the fact that this is an early-20th century downtown LA building, and probably could suffer significant damage when the Big One hits.... Well worth a try if you need to stay downtown. It's on 7th near Olive, in the jewelery district, so it's reasonably close ($6 taxi) to the Music Center and Ahmanson.

We did not regret it at all. The room is reasonably sized with great modern yet classy decor. It is a dark wallpapered look so very different from your usual run of the mill hotel chain. Great lighting fixtures, albeit overall a bit dim. The room we stayed in (1212) was on the top floor and overlooked LA LIVE which was a litle distracting cos they had rotating search lights all night which shone over nearby Ritz (how those people staying there took it I wouldnt know). During our stay, the rooftop was closed for maintainence sadly. Whilst we did not know much about the history of the club itself (very illustrious indeed) it was clear that it was a proud heritage that the hotel took pride in keeping up. The room amenities were good and very suited for a business type hotel. From observing other guests, it was clear that many business travellers stayed here very regularly. The breakfast spread was adequate and in a very posh dining room with great attentive service. The downside was that the parking arrangement was slightly inconvenient. We arrived with alot of bags (at the end of a 3 week trip around California) so we pulled up into the carpark and there were no lots til 6th or 7th floor (with the entrance to the hotel itself on the 1st floor) so we had to turn around back down. The staff were incredibly friendly and directed us to park to the side of the entrance to the car park and unload (10 min). But what we didnt know was that there were lots of steps down to the front lobby of the hotel itself (the parking garage was to the back) . I would suggest, if you are checking in with your own car and lots of stuff, to pull up at the front and unload first and then park later. Similarly, car parking for guests per night was US$12 so they had to issue a car park slip separately which we had to then exchange and validate with the car park attendant each time we had to leave (so we could leave for free). A slight inconvenience which could have been dealt with better, but small issue. Because we had a car, location itself wasn't that important (we stayed at Hollywood and Venice on earlier days) so we wanted to try downtown. Definetely not touristy like the 2 previous locations but it worked for us as we wanted a quiet last 2 nights of our busy busy trip (mostly for packing).

There's what I'm pretty sure is a full length, multi-lane swimming pool with a kiddie pool next to it. There's a basketball court that might be full length too. There are exercise machines, a sauna, even a billiard room. The hotel rooms only take up the top 3 floors and there didn't seem to be a whole lot of people staying there one Friday night. I thought they might be there more as a convenience for club members and their families than as a full-fledged hotel. The floor by floor dress code (I kid you not) explained on a paper in my room might fit that image. The rooms are extremely dowdy. The place's elegance has a faded a bit too much, at least in the guest rooms. They're so dowdy that the club plans to renovate them this summer into a richer, retro, yes clubby look. They had photosimulations of the rooms posted on the floor where I stayed. It might have been nice if they'd told us this on the website. For now, the rooms are just tired, the chairs, all the furnishings, the bed lines are all faded. There aren't enough light fixtures in the room, though mine got some eastern natural light, amidst the buildings of Downtown Los Angeles (I liked that part). The carpet was really stained all over the place, not something I normally notice. I don't think there was true dirt around and nothing bit me, but it did add up to a depressing feeling. I'd note parenthetically that I tend to discount complaints on Tripadvisor that something is, horrors, old. Some people seem offended that buildings--like, say, the Waldorf-Astoria--were built more than 10 years ago. But the LA Athletic Club is old in the bad sense. After the renovation it could be much better. I didn't feel a lot of warmth from the people working there. Most were OK, but at least one seemed to be mocking me, not a feeling I usually get in a hotel. Maybe by wearing a daypack backpack I was violating the dress code! It really didn't work well when I tried to check in (at normal time, with a reservation) and the front desk clerk called and called housekeeping to find an available room. Positives: Well located within Downtown LA, close to most Downtown locations and plenty of transit including numerous bus lines and Metrorail lines. They included a free, large, if mediocre breakfast in one of the many dining rooms. City views of a historic part of Downtown LA. A roof deck with nothing but some chairs on it, but even better city views. All those athletic facilities, which might be good with a kid.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fla", "Title": "\u201cNice gym equipment.. albeit rather quiet\u201d", "Author": "Son-of-Poochmas", "ReviewID": "UR17595404", "Content": "Stayed 06/08; friendly greeting; large room - clean although the building is a bit old (ie. rug).

It's certainly a popular place and was sold out for our weekend but the room was beyond depressing (I rarely do this but asked to move) and so was moved to the only other room available (which they told me was smaller) and because it was smaller it didn't have, for instance, a mini-fridge. No big deal but rather silly. Both were depressing; gray in decor, charmless, a nylon bedspread, and no view out of the windows in either room. Meaning not just a bad view but you looked at other guest rooms no matter how you sat. And we were there for business and yet there were no business services (such as a desk). Maybe in the \"bigger\" rooms? But not in the two I saw. As well, the onsite restaurant was empty at night and ... here's that word again -- depressing. Perhaps it's a good weekday lunch spot but again, for the leisure-oriented traveler, ick. And the location is poor. It's not near anything. In fact despite what I'd heard about a renaissance in LA (and it's true, there are definitely areas in downtown that sparkle) this wasn't one of them. I'm a fairly intrepid traveler but I was leery about walking around at night -- which is I why I stayed onsite for dinner the first night. I did venture out the second (couldn't face another meal in the dining room) and tried the Water Grill -- it's a seafood restaurant a few blocks away, highly recommended and rather expensive. But it was marvelous, just marvelous and was the highlight of my weekend. One of the benefits I'll admit to an LA Athletic Club stay is to use the facilities -- and they have a pool and tons of space for working out -- but attending a conference meant there really wasn't time to utilize them.

A real gem.\u201d", "Author": "CarolSP", "ReviewID": "UR5894056", "Content": "I recently stayed here for three night on business. What a bargain! The pluses: It's conveniently close to the freeway, right in the jewelry district of LA, and very reasonably priced. Staff are fabulous: polite, helpful, and friendly. It's a beautiful old building, and the rooms, while small, are very nice. It's got an older, slightly funky charm. You can see signs of wear-and-tear on it, but I have to say the bed, while firmer than I like, was still reasonably comfortable, and everything was very clean. There are such nice little touches, too, like a basket of fruit and cheese delivered to your room before check-in, chocolate mints every day on your pillows, and you can order free morning coffee service delivered to your room. I've never before seen not just shampoo, conditioner, soaps and creams in the bathrooms, but also a fresh disposable razor, shaving cream, & a toothbrush and some toothpaste, as well. It also has a very good restaurant on site, which offers a free breakfast: no continental silliness here: this is a full breakfast, with eggs, potatoes, toast, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, yogurt (the real stuff, not just yoplait, though they have that as well) etc. On Fridays they have a cook there doing omelettes to order. The restaurant offers dinner and lunch as well, and, by LA standards, is reasonably priced and pretty good quality. You are free to use the athletic facilities, too: an indoor pool, weights, sauna, steam room, etc.) It IS an athletic club, after all. Over all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, except possibly someone who was mobility impaired: while there are elevators, of course, I think there may be some areas (like the parking garage) which would be at least a hassle to get to for someone on crutches or a wheelchair, or just had trouble with stairs, if in fact it's possible to avoid the stairs from the lobby area to the elevators which go to the garage. Indoor parking is reasonably priced and seemed more than adequate for the size of the hotel.", "Date": "September 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta ga", "Title": "\u201cA sad spot\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4824319", "Content": "I attended a conference at this hotel, and was fore-warned not to book a room.
