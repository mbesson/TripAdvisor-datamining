The floors of the rooms and mattress/box springs are probably the original ones from when the hotel was built in the 70's. The toilet ran constantly, which is probably why the prior person had the shut off valve turned off. When I went to call the front desk the phone didn't even have dial tone, luckily I figured out why there was no water in the toilet. One day we returned to our room and we didn't have any towels, not even our dirty ones. The front desk person helped on both of these. There were also dead bugs behind the glass of the pictures of the wall. And the shower curtain rod was about to fall down. - see pictures. I'm not picky, but I'd equate this place to glorified camping. I didn't want my young kids touching anything. It is close walking distance to a lot of places, but also is located directly behind a shopping center. I stay at super 8's probably about 12 times per year and they are usually fine. I would have checked out after the first night had I not pre-paid for my stay.

I would say this motel is a great spot for friends to use because it is cheaper than most and provides adequate service and convienient location relative to innercity areas such as gaslamp or shopping districts. Although the outside presentation of the motel is not that great( chipped stair well paint and lack of lighting at late night), it is great on the inside; in the place where you will actually be staying. Connecting rooms make it easier for friends to hangout and not be seperated from eachother simply for the sake of beds and it also keeps bigger families together so that more time can be spent with each other on vacation. By the way, don't forget to get juice(orange or passion fruit) from the lobby in the mornings; it was very good.

The room was very comfortable and very cozy. It felt like a furnished apartment with all the furniture and desk and chairs that were provided. The bed was clean with Crisp white sheets and a soft mattress that didn't hurt the back. The complimentary breakfast was a little on the light side but it is also understandable considering the prices they are charging for the rooms. It is also a 30 second walk next door to the shopping center where you can find Jamba Juice and Noah's Bagels. There are various places to eat food in the area and there is also a 24 Hour fitness 2 min away for the health conscious traveler.

The first night, a drunken man started banging on our door at 3:30 AM and constantly knocked on our door and window for several minutes. We were two women alone in a hotel room in an unfamiliar city and didn't want to try to deal with it ourselves, so we called the front desk to have the manager chase him off. The desk worker on duty hung up on my roommate when she told him our problem. She immediately called back and asked if they could do something about it and was told, \"Just tell him to go away,\" before she was hung up on a second time. The knocking man wandered off on his own shortly afterwards, though we had been seriously considering calling the police since the management obviously didn't care about the safety of their guests. We thought this was incredibly unprofessional. The next day, our room was very cold and we couldn't get the heater in our room working. We called the front desk to ask about it and were told they couldn't do anything about it. They didn't even offer to move us to a different room, despite the fact there were several empty rooms we could have moved into. We asked for extra blankets and were told they didn't have any - again, there were several empty rooms. We spent 2 days freezing in our room before they were able to find a single spare blanket - not that helpful considering we had 2 beds - and it didn't look clean enough to use anyway. The next to last day of our trip, I wanted to call home and couldn't get the phone in our room to work. I called the front desk and was told that I had to pay a $20 phone deposit to have the phone line in our room turned on. I was making a single toll-free call with a calling card and thought this was a little ridiculous. Still, I went down to the office and payed the deposit and asked again about getting our heater fixed because our room was barely warmer than it was outside. This time, the desk worker told me that to get the heater working, we had to turn the temperature dial all the way to the cold side and then turn it on. Though completely counterintuitive, this worked when I tried it. We turned the heater off while we were out for conference activities that evening. When we turned it on after we returned, sparks started shooting out of the heater and the room was immediately filled with an acrid burning smell strong enough we had to open the door to air out the room, thus driving out what little heat we had managed to trap in the room. We spent our last night in a frigid room. This was probably the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, and I'm pretty cheap when it comes to these things. I've never been to a hotel that obviously cared so little about their guests. It would have expected this sort of service if the room was $40 a night in San Diego, but the hotel wasn't cheap. It was certainly not worth the money we paid. We also had other friends who stayed in the same hotel at the same time who had problems with their rooms too, so our room didn't see atypical for the hotel.

The pool gates are NOT locked,and one can push their way into the pool. When I arrived, the pool gate latched open with a hook and rope! This is an extremely dangerout situation for any child. When I unlatched the gate to close it, the lock on the gate was frozen in the open position. Hotel itself is OK - at least clean. Room is ample size with king bed, table, 2 chairs, dresser, nightstands. Hotel is essentially a parking lot. The building is 3 stories, and is about a block long. Parking in front of your room. Across the lot is the lodaing area for a local strip mall. Nothing romantic here, but servicable. There is a Jamba Juice, Starbucks and Einstein's Bagles near the front. I paid $125/night. The local Motel 6 (at Hotel Circle, about 2 ;miles from here) is $85.00/night. Room comes with hair dryer, shampoo. Front desk staff lacks personality. Just bland, processing their papers. This is not a resort, so do not expect one.

When we first checked in the guy behind the desk refused to check us in because we didn't have the AAA card. It was with my girlfriends father who was at sea world. He raised his voice and started to scream and yell at me. I advised him that there is no need to raise his voice at me. He finally said ok, as long as you bring your AAA card before checkout, then I will give you the rate... As for the rooms, TERRIBLE.. extremely outdated, odor was horrible, had to buy a scented candle from the store to give somewhat of a fresh scent, but still the odor was overpowering. We stayed for two nights and after the first night, they did not take out any of the trash that was in the room.. The pool was extremely dirty with dirt piled in corners of the pool. I was not about to jump in there. No alarm clocks in the room, paint chipping off wall, spider webs hanging in corners of the room, bathroom door would not close, a/c barely worked.. If there were hotels available somewhere else I would have left that hotel in a heartbeat. Disgusting.. As for when I checked out, he charged me more than what he was supposed to and when I confronted him about it, he said tough luck, you should have shown me the AAA card at the time of check in. I told him that he told me as long as I showed it by check out then we would be fine, He said he never told me that.. I never signed the receipt and asked for a manager, he said there wasn't one cuz it was sunday and that if I had a problem then to call back during the week.. I asked for a phone # to the manager and all he gave me was a card and it wasn't even for a manager.. This guy was the rudest person I ever met in my life and it takes a lot to make me mad, and i was furious... I do not recommend this hotel to anybody, EVER, please pay a little more to stay somewhere where you won't get treated the way that I was...", "Date": "August 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glendale, Cal", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location/nice people & rooms\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3805421", "Content": "The location is perfect there are tons of places to eat, and shop.

The room was very clean and comfortable and hotel is in a great location near the airport, highway and tons of shopping. Unfortunately the manager doesn't know mch about treating customers as I heard him yelling across the parking lot at some guests telling them to walk their lazy selves to the lobby if they wanted him to do anything for them. Then he came back in the lobby and I heard him basically say 'tough luck' to a family whose TV wasn't working. After he left I had to listen to the clerk complain about the rude manager and how all the employees want to quit. My main issue though was we arranged for a wake-up call at 4:30 am for a 6:15 flight and it never came! There are no clocks in the room. Luckily my husband set his watch alarm so we didn't miss the plane.
