Only minutes away from the train station, this property is well located in a quiet and safe suburb called Giardinetti. Although internet connectivity is not included (and is a bit pricey) and the shower stalls were quite small, overall, the rooms were spacious, clean and quiet. The full breakfast menu in the morning also included a full variety of delicious fruit, meats, pastries, juices, and fresh Espresso coffee. Service was always top-notch, courteous and very polite. Would I stay there again the next time I visit Rome? Absolutely.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cAlmost 4 stars hotel but outside Rome!\u201d", "Author": "maniac_the_evil", "ReviewID": "UR118555955", "Content": "The hotel is great, situated outside Rome.

The hotel is rated as four stars, but not up to the standards of the US or Canadian hotels. I would say it is not better than three star. The rooms are large with hardwood floors that are noisy and dimmly lighted with a single 22w round fluorescent bulb overhead. The shower is a challenge because it is small and the shower head sprays into all corners of the stall. If you wanted to turn the water on and adjust the temperature before you get in, you'll end up with a very wet floor in front of the shower. You also can't do much to dry up the wet floor because you only get two bath towels and four thin hand towels that resemble table napkins. No bathmats. The room door needs to be slammed shut. One day I came back from a day in town and found the door left open, probably courtesy of the cleaning staff. If you want to visit Rome, don't stay here, it will take you at least 1 to 2 hours to get to the city.

TV clicker (scotch-taped to keep it closed); brought it to the desk and after saying politely it didn't work the clerk got very agitated speaking in loud Italian, proceeded to dump a box of remotes onto the counter! Finally took another, also scotch-taped shut- it worked only if you pressed really hard on the battery case, although none of the channels were in English anyway (no CNN Europe,etc) 2. Door key didn't work 3 different times in 4 days- had to bring it down to the desk each time to have them do something with the computer to fix it- never a small apology for the inconvenience, acted put out. 3. Food was very mediocre at best and I am not fussy (I go to McDonalds often). 3 levels below Olive Garden. A co-traveler remarked that he had always heard about Italian food- all in our group were disappointed at the quality here. 4. The restaurant manager one evening loudly berating one of the wait staff for over 5 minutes- not too pleasant to dine by. 5. In bad neighborhood, miles and miles from anything remotely of interest as a tourist and 65 Euro taxi ride from the main airport. 6. I was with a tour group- apparently chosen on the cheap by the tour operator to cut costs. Everyone on the tour was actually laughing at how surly the staff were- everyone couldn't wait to get out of there. 7. The rooms are big but the beds small, no carpeting. 8. Brush up on your Italian/ sign language as the desk staff can't speak English (to be fair, perhaps equal to my high school French in fluency) 9. No Rome cab drivers have ever heard of it because it is so far off the beaten path- bring a map and directions in Italian if you are forced to stay here. 10. This supposedly 4 star hotel couldn't compete with a Days Inn/Comfort Inn/Red Roof Inn/ Motel 6 in the US- don't go here unless you want to share funny stories years later of appallingly rude service that was so bad it was funny.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jerusalem, Israel", "Title": "\u201cout of the way\u201d", "Author": "dzohar", "ReviewID": "UR3936875", "Content": "The Capital Inn Hotel is located east of the Ring Road that encircles Rome.
