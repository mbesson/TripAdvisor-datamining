Our room, on the corner of the hotel, had lots of windows and was very pleasant, though with the burgundy/red velvet drapes closed, there was something of a bordello feel to the room. The bathroom was great except that the shower drain was VERY slow. We noticed the drain in the bathroom sink off the dining area was also slow. Staff attempted without success to attend to our shower drain, blaming it on the building's old plumbing. The staff is very helpful and friendly, and the breakfast is very good, though the dining area is almost below ground, with not much natural light. In addition to the complimentary breakfast, the hotel offers complimentary tea (with sandwiches and pastries) in the late afternoon. When we first arrived, the concierge on duty took us immediately to the dining area, offered us whatever we wanted to drink, and spent the next half hour carefully orienting us on the map and explaining how to get to all the sites. Thereafter, the staff was exceptionally generous in their time and attention addressing any inquiry or concern. The hotel is in a great location in Sultanahmet, just a short walk uphill to the Blue Mosque. From there it is only a little farther to Aya Sofya, Topkapi, the Grand Bazaar and even Istanbul University and the Sulymanyah mosque. We only took the tram, which stops at the Sultanahmet station near the Blue Mosque, to cross the Golden Horn and see that part of the City. All you want to see in Sultanahmet is within walking distance of the hotel, even when raining, as was the case our first day or two there. There is a great, inexpensive restaurant just a block or two away from the hotel. I was surprised the hotel staff advised us not to drink the tap water in Istanbul. The hotel provided us with a complimentary litre bottle of water everyday.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Stay !!\u201d", "Author": "Remco_73", "ReviewID": "UR128536976", "Content": "Second time we stayed in this lovely hotel.

Breakfast is included and is quite nice in a pleasant dining room. One of the best things about the location is that it is just 100 meters from the highway that connects to the airport, so taxi drivers can find it easily and the ride to and from the airport is 15 minutes shorter than other nearby hotels. Minus: Lighting in the bathroom is abysmal. A couple of low wattage bulbs cast creepy shadows and make it impossible to shave or put on makeup. Hint to hotel: if the light is too dim to read, it's too dim. Also, street sounds creep up to the streetside rooms, it's not terribly noisy but might distract light sleepers.

The owners have recently renovated all rooms to a high quality level and hired the manager, Arthur, who has hired quality staff from the front desk to restaurant servers. Usually three at the front desk (compared to zero at times at other small hotels) including the manager who has no private room to isolate him from the guests. When I arrived a front desk a young woman, Tina (graduate of the top Turkish university, Istanbul University), registered me, then took me to the then empty restaurant to orient me in Istanbul, recommend and explain sites, and help me organize my time including one 4 hour guided tour which was excellent and gave me information I valued along with avoiding most of the long lines for entrance. My room was clean with complete daily service, attractive, comfortable bed, and small but completely adequate bathroom. Although was quite satisfied, Arthur offered to change me to a then available room on a higher floor with a nice view of the attractive square in front of the hotel. At check out, I did complain at the cost of the \"full day\" guide (4 hours) and the assistant manager reduced the charge of the tour agency without knowing whether the agency would agree. The hotel's attitude of service and honoring their guests excelled all others I have experienced in my travels in 54 countries. Istanbul is a complete winner as a city to visit - rich history represented by the majestic mosques and other sites, safe, friendly, old city (Sultanahumet where Amira is located) is fun to explore with its laberinth of streets, shops, cafes, street venders and convenient street car (tram).

It is an OK bargain hotel in Istanbul, but it is nowhere near a top 10 hotel in Istanbul, which really does have quite a few near-spectacular mid-range hotels. Our interactions with the staff were nowhere near the exceptional anything-for-service experience so many people report. The room we had was very basic, with nowhere near the personality and elegance of the rooms in their pictures. The breakfast was OK, but literally nothing special. Because they describe their double beds as \"King-Size\", we booked a standard room with one \"King-Size\" bed. We got a room on the first floor, a few steps up from the lobby. Maybe on a good day the bed was queen size, but I do not think it was even that. My wife and I decided we could not both sleep on It (I have sleep disorders - it is not just that we are spoiled). We requested a room change or an extra bed, which we would happily pay for. Although we were checking in in the morning, they insisted neither was possible. I requested just a mattress, which I would use on the floor, but they insisted this was not possible either. They suggested that one of us could sleep on the sofa, which they could open up so that you sleep on it. It was not a sleeper; it was not flat; it was at most 5 feet in length: it provided horrible support. I can honestly say it was one of the worst night's sleep ever. We offered that we could stand it for one night if they could get us another room, bed or mattress for the second night. They said they would work on that, but when we came back for the second night, they told us nothing was possible. We left the next morning and changed hotels. They also told us that the Blue Mosque was closed to non-Muslims due to Ramadan. Luckily, a local told us that it was still open that day, but might be closed the next day. If we had taken the Amira concierge (manager??, desk staff??) at his word, we would have missed the Blue Mosque. Also, don't be fooled that they are located in the center. It is a LONG walk from the tram. Heavy luggage will make you regret your choice. It is light and clean. The bed was OK (visco does not mean tempurpedic). Internet was OK. It is quiet. It is near the waterfront, which is not to be missed if you do stay here. Personally, I will not stay here again.

THEY ARE BASED ON MY EXPEREINCE AS A HOTELIER AND FREQUENT TRAVELS TO OVER 15 DESTINATIONS AND STAY IN ALL TYPES OF HOTEL WORLDWIDE EACH YEAR. CHECK-IN-CHECK OUT: The personal and attentive welcome by Front Desk Manager, Arthur Coskun is a positive example of how hotels should operate and make guests feel at home. Good customer relation action. THE STAFF: Amira has been perhaps fortunate to employ a group of people who understands and promotes the customer friendly and professional approach that all guests should expereince. Well done. Well done. The PROPERTY: Well maintained. Rooms asigned to us (Family Room on 3rd Floor-305 & 306 with 2 single beds in one room and one king size in the other is perfect for a family of 3 or other groups) The rooms were very clean, spacious, parque flooring, adequate natural light and equipped with the essentials, including tea and coffee making facilities and complimentary bottles of drinking water each day. Bathroom spacious, clean and re-stocked and cleaned each day. Good storage for clothing and luggage of guests. Good water flow in both shower, wc and sink. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN ROOMS: (1)Exam the shower door as it needs fixing to ensure it opens easily and without need for force (2) Provide reading light over the writing desk and a more suitable chair. It was not the ideal idea to place the telvision in the middle of the desk wall mirror!!! (can this be changed?) (3) Remove one of each light over the beds (having 2 to serve the same purpose) is not necessary. (4) Do maintennance check of bathrooms to verify the cause of water leak that comes through when it rains as experienced in Room 306 (5) Regulate the hot water temperature or provide warning/advice in bathroom for guests to be aware of the intensity of the hotwater when fully turned on. HOTEL FACILITIES: Dining room is on the lower basement area with a bar attached and the kitchen nearby. There is also a communal sitting area, much like a conservatory in the basement area. A television is provided in the dining area and a computer terminal for use by guests. An ATM machine is provided in the conservatory area. Daily breakfast offerings include a range of food and drink that are well presented. Did not see a toaster and forgot to ask if this is available. Access to the dining area and conservatory is via stairs, Like many hotels in Istanbul, not user friendly for people with restricted mobility/disability. The reception area is very small and has 2 garden type benches. There is a lift that enable guests to access the fitness rooms on the lower floor, all bedrooms and the roof-top sitting area that is used as relaxing and dining area when the weather permits. From here, guests have good views towards the sea and the Blue Mosque. HOTEL LOCATION: Like most places in Istanbul, the Amira is built on a hill and pebble stone streets are the norm in most places. You need comfortable walking shoes. It is ideal for guests who enjoy short walks to many of the major attractions such as the Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, Topak Palace, Hagia Sophia Museum, etc and the main tramway that runs through the heart of the Asian side of Istanbul and Sultanhamet to the European side. Give yourself time and watch your steps along the pebble stone streets fro uneven surfaces. There are many good restaurants, local grocery and souvineir shops near to Amira Hotel. You can also turn left outside the hotel towards the sea and visit the range the Fish Market and range of fish restaurants by the sea. Pleasant promenade walk for miles in either direction. FURTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT: (1) Remove the computer terminal from the dining room and place it in the conservatory area where the ATM machine is located.

There was fresh water in the room each day for us, nice comfortable robes and a nice bathroom with a great shower. The room also had a safe for keeping valuables. The beds were very comfortable and the room was quiet. The breakfast every morning was great with lots of options to choose from. It filled me up so much that I didn't even need lunch several days! I would recommend taking a cab to the airport instead of arranging transportation with the hotel. A cab was only 35-40 turkish lira.

The breakfast was awesome! And I also highly recommend the \"tea time\" that they provide from 4:30-6:30pm each day. There were a variety of cakes and some sandwiches. You could pretty much eat for free during your entire stay in Istanbul, loading up on the food that Hotel Amira provides. The rooms were fine, nothing fancy, but fanciness wasn't something I was looking for. No complaints from me. Free wifi in the rooms worked great too. They had a different network on each floor, so I'm sure it works great wherever you are in the building. There's a beautiful terrace on the roof, which I highly recommend checking out. You can see the Blue Mosque from it. Location was fabulous as well. It's about a 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque (the walk is uphill, which should be noted if you are in some way disabled). I really have no complaints at all and would recommend Hotel Amira to anyone I knew who was travelling to Istanbul! **Edit** If you're being picky, my one complaint is that you can hear the loudspeaker from the Blue Mosque in your rooms.

The WiFi worked really well, better than any 5-star hotel I have stayed at. The strength was quite good and access is free. The breakfast buffet was top quality. With some items changing from day to day and some items remaining the same - which is a nice touch. Coffee, tea and orange juice are included in the buffet, if you ask for for Turkish Coffee or Capuccinos or Espressos, then it is charged at extra. The hotel even organised for my postcards to be stamped and mailed. This brings me into the wonderful service they offer. So personable and always ready to help. Friendly and warm and always did it with a smile. So the rest of the reviews that say, someone sits you down with a map when you arrive and gives you an orientation and allows you time to ask questions is a nice touch. If you want any reservation, planning, they are all willing to do it for you. They have a cab station right outside the hotel, so that is very useful. I plan to return in September with my partner this time and will definitely stay there if we go. I did like the neighbourhood since it is close to all the touristy sites (mosques, cistern, palace and little local restaurants with seafood) and love how you can walk to the train station, Grand Bazaar, Arasta Bazaar and enjoy the local areas and connect with local culture. The old cobblestone streets are quaint. Now, a lot of people say the night life and cafes are all in the new part, Taksim, but for us it was no big deal to take the tram there or a cab. It cost 5-6 dollars by cab if you get to Taksim Square and then you can walk from there to all the happening places. All in all, I would recommend the hotel because of the personal touch, the quality of the hotel, food and service.

They were indispensable with regard to planning our daily activities and suggested many unforgettable restaurants and experiences. Amira is situated very conveniently in the Sultanahmet, so you're walking distance from the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Grand Bazaar and Spice Market. The hotel itself is luxurious and well equipped. Rooms are very comfortable, and well appointed. Amira has an unforgettable aroma - they waft a beautiful fragrance through the hotel. It's the first thing you'll notice on arrival, and you'll miss it once you leave. On a past trip to Istanbul, I stayed at the Four Seasons which was also a stunning property, but for charm and privacy, I would stay at Amira again. The beauty of it being a boutique hotel, is you get the feeling that the property is yours while you're there. We were part of a big group of friends, and every breakfast, and teatime was unforgettable. I was pleased with the selection for breakfast, and needed nothing more. The teatimes in the afternoon were special - the baking interesting, and they always had some wonderful Turkish delight available. The taxi drivers in Istanbul are a rotten bunch, so it's useful to have the Amira staff negotiate your journey with them before you depart. Also have the Amira staff negotiate your rate with the taxi drivers. Everytime we used a taxi away from the hotel, we had a bad experience - sometimes having to direct the drivers ourselves to make sure we ended up back at the hotel! They seem to have a tactic that they all use: They are immediately confused by any address, or card that you give them. They then consult with other taxi drivers who seem equally clueless. Then after a number of phonecalls, they take you on long roundabout routes to increase the metered fare. If you're sensitive to smoking as I am, be weary of the taxi drivers you pick, some of whom seem to light up at free will. That said, if you're planning to spend your time in the Old City, the Hotel will provide you with a good map of the area, and most of the sites are within walking distance, and it is the best way to view the city. Personally, I prefer Istanbul in winter. There is a certain charm to the city with a light dusting of snow.

We were offered welcome tea and snacks while our luggage was brought to our rooms for us. We all stayed in standard rooms, which are spacious, modern, trendy and spotless. Amenities included handmade local products, a loofah sponge, complimentary water and WiFi. I had room 404, which was at the end of the hallway. My colleagues had rooms on lower floors or closer to the stairs. They all slept like roses, but I took a while to get to sleep due to noise from the neighbors. I could hear a man snore, and a couple came back in the middle of the night and were very loud. The receptionist told me that the lower floors have better insulation, but that they are working on insulating the higher floors as well. I did have a nice balcony, which would have been great in summer. Included in the price is an extensive breakfast buffet as well as a complimentary afternoon buffet with several kinds of pastries, Turkish Delight, coffee and tea. Both are served in their stylish, cozy restaurant. Amira is located in the historical center of Istanbul and is an easy 5 minute walk from the Blue Mosque.

I hope my review puts them back in first place for Istanbul. The hotel is perfect. Wonderful location, friendly and helpful staff, pretty swank rooms and atmosphere. I also thought it was a very reasonable price for what you got. As everyone else said, it is just exactly what you would want in a hotel. The one negative is that the tours that you book through the hotel (or get free with a lot of packages) are terrible and overpriced. We went on the Old City tour because it was free with our package (which is basically two sites- Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque- within throwing distance of the hotel and the bazaar). If you stay at the hotel , you will walk by these sites countless times to restaurants, etc. That is probably the most amazing part of being in Istanbul. They are strikingly beautiful. However, this frigging tour takes us to the entire other side of Istanbul to change cars and then brings you back. So it is an hour of driving to literally get back to the exact same place where you were. We couldn't even believe it. The absolute worst part of it though is the final part of the tour is this ridiculous sales pitch for rugs. I felt like it was one of those time-share scams where they give you something free but you have to sit through a sales pitch- for like a half hour. Plus the tour guides don't really don't tell you anything. So, we were really annoyed to have wasted like three hours driving out of the way and back again and then having to sit through a sales pitch. Just go see the sites yourself (the Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, and the Bazaar) The other tour we took was a tour of the Bosphorus. It cost the two of us 70 euro. Again, across town and back again. It's not as bad because the exchange between vehicles it is actually much closer to the boat tour. But the kicker was that the boat tour could be had for 12.50 lira. So, for the two of us, it would have cost 25 lira, which would have been like 14 bucks instead of the 110 dollars that the tour cost. The tour had no value added beyond taking us to the place where the boats leave from. You can get a taxi for like 15 lira (or 9 bucks). So, save yourself the money and the time, take a cab, and pay 20some dollars instead of the vastly more money for the useless transfer and tour guide.

As mentioned in some reviews, it is true that on the rooms located on the ground floor, the street noise could be excessive, that\u00c2\u00b4s why, 10 minutes after arrival, on thursday night, I decided to ask for a room change, what the hotel did for me. In my case, I mentioned that I made the reservation more than 2 months ago, and that they had a lot of time to assign me a better room, what they did immediately, therefore once this first minor issue was saved, the stay was simply fantastic. Good breakfast, and very well decorated rooms, with a lot of style and charme. All the staff is very friendly, open to assist and help, suggest, and provide indications on key places to visit.

I have spent many holidays in Turkey and have lived in the country for a period of time in various tourist areas. This is one of this nicest places I have stayed while on holiday in Turkey. It is a beautiful hotel with very kind and caring staff who helped me organise anything I needed. I arrived late at night and had organised a private pick up, which was very much worth it as I was not feeling well on arrival. The next morning I woke up late and missed breakfast but when the staff realised I had missed breakfast they had someone in the kitchen make me up a lovely platter. The breakfast spread is amazing and they have a great selection of cheeses, meats, cereals, olives, pastries, and juices/teas/coffees. The rooms are very, VERY comfortable and really charming. The location is fantastic and is only a very short (maybe 3-5min walk) from the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, the underground basilica, Islamic arts museum and various other sites. It is maybe a 10minute walk from the Grand Bazaar and once there you are very close to the Spice Bazaar. The only problem I had was when I was leaving and I decided to get a taxi, instead of a private transfer, from the hotel to the airport. Unfortunately the taxi driver tried to rip me off quite a great deal of money for the ride. This is not the fault of the hotel in anyway but did take away from my enjoyable experience so I do recommend private transfers. Otherwise, find out how much the trip should be (I think it is roughly 25-35YTL) but double check with the staff and make sure the taxi driver keeps the toll on at all times. The hotel suits all travellers including business, couples, family, friends and solo. I travelled as a single female and felt very safe and looked after, not that I have felt unsafe in any of my time spent in Turkey. However, I probably have never been so comfortable. Overall, I cannot speak highly enough of my experience here and will most definitely return back to Hotel Amira on my next trip to Istanbul.

It was an absolutely perfect start to our two-week vacation! Before we even flew to Istanbul, the hotel emailed us some info and e-brochures of the top attractions and restaurants in Istanbul. On arrival, we were welcomed warmly by the staff, and had complimentary drinks while Hotel Amira's Arthur gave us a brief but thorough orientation of the city (old and new areas), a map, and his mobile number just in case we need to call for help. Then he personally escorted us to the family room, which was lovely, incredibly spacious (2 queen beds, a divan, a baby cot, dressing table, 2 accent chairs with small table... we brought in 4 medium luggage, and there was still room to move around in), clean, and conveniently close to the hotel dining area and reception. The hotel has free wifi in the rooms (my teen daughter was so happy), an iMac in a common area for guests to use, and an on-site ATM. The best historical sights, plus very good shopping options (there's an arcade bazaar en route to the Hippodrome and a multi-floor rug-jewelry-ceramic shop called Nakkas which is a recommended shopping stop by Royal Caribbean cruise line), are within 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel. For those who care to know, there's also a McDonald's and Starbucks between the Hagia Sofia and the Grand Bazaar. Our second day in Istanbul was my son's 2nd birthday, and the hotel staff surprised us with a yummy cake with 2 candles for him when we returned to the hotel for the complimentary 5 o'clock tea spread. Our dinner reservation that night with Sarnic Restaurant, previously a cistern behind Hagia Sofia, was arranged by Arthur... and then he offered to drive us there on his way home after his shift! How sweet is that? A half-day Bosphorus cruise can likewise be arranged by the hotel (though we didn't have time to try it), and the price is good compared to others we checked online. Before I booked this hotel, my husband was insistent that we stay at one of the big hotel chains on the Taksim side of Istanbul. Within minutes of checking in at Amira though, the whole family unanimously agreed: no chain hotel gives personal service like this.

Just to give you a feel of the level of service: Our sons wanted to buy a simit (sesame bread) when leaving the hotel, but then the porter stepped in and offered them two simits. We were also not charged for extras we had asked for. I would especially recommend the place for families with school children. The family room consists of two seperate room (one of the more luxurious) that are separated by a door. To our relief the door cannot be locked unilaterally even by adventurous kids. A small drawback is that -although the hotel is in a relatively quiet neighbourhood - it is too loud to sleep with open windows in most rooms.

In between, every employee was friendly, helpful, and professional. Amira has a tradition of welcoming guests with drinks of your choice while an employee goes over maps of the city and its attractions and how to get there from the hotel, all suited to your interests. They prefer to do this on their outdoor terrace on the top of the hotel, but weather will govern the location. It's a nice touch that can be reassuring. Seldom will you have to open the hotel's front door yourself, regardless of time of day or night. Hotel Amira has comfortable and very clean rooms and bathrooms. Standard rooms can be a little tight, so it's worth asking them to upgrade to Deluxe. Bedding and chairs are comfortable and room d\u00c3\u00a9cor nicely chosen. The hotel is conveniently located to all of the major Old Town attractions, all short walks but uphill, which for some might add to the time, but one can get to the Blue Mosque, for instance in about 7 mins. at a reasonable pace. The neighborhood is a mixture of hotels and local domestic living, so it's worthwhile to wander the surrounding streets to appreciate more local culture. For instance, one block away is a very nice green market, with attractive vegetables, etc. bought mostly by local residents. Restaurants close-by seem to run from good to excellent, although in many d\u00c3\u00a9cor is Spartan or certainly unpretentious. For instance, three blocks uphill toward the Blue Mosque is a non-descript little mosque in a road fork. On the left, just before the fork and up a few stairs is an excellent restaurant whose name escapes. Local dishes of various meats and seafood are delicious and the rear seating d\u00c3\u00a9cor suggests antiquity and is in the same area as their large baking oven, which produces among other dishes super nan breads. At the top end of the vegetable market is another restaurant, which looks like many cafeterias in the USA, but which produces a large and delicious variety of local dishes. Prices at both restaurants are very reasonable; of course, since neither serves alcohol, the overall cost for tourists is even more within budget, so to speak. One block down from the hotel is a not-to-be-missed smaller mosque, colloquially called the Little Aya Sophia, if memory serves because it was designed by the same favored architect. It is a beautiful harmony of textures and colors, and uncrowded. Hotel Amira is centrally situated especially for Old Town, but it has easy access to the low-priced tram that takes you to Istiklal night-life and to Taksim Square shopping.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cranbrook, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe truth is written here\u201d", "Author": "Tstravels1", "ReviewID": "UR119975099", "Content": "We booked this hotel before and after our cruise of Turkey and Greece.

We stayed at the White House (ranked #4) for the last night. The service was good at the White House, and the room was very nice, but here are the differences: 1) The Amira provided bottled water (for making tea/coffee in the room, drinking, brushing your teeth) every day (no one else we spoke with on our trip had this amenity, and when you arrive after an overseas flight, tired and wanting to freshen up, the last thing you want to do is go hunting for bottled water to brush your teeth!) 2) The breakfast buffet was extensive, and everything labelled.

I was really impressed by how quickly and efficiently the team responded to my emails. We also arranged collection from the airport via the hotel, as we were due to arrive very late in the evening. We knew this would not be the cheapest way of doing it, but we wanted peace of mind and a driver who definitely knew where he was going! We were pleased to find him waiting for us holding a card as we came into the arrivals lounge and enjoyed a swift transfer back to the hotel. Our room was lovely, at the side of the hotel (overlooking another hotel). There was very little noise from traffic etc. I think the room number was 701 - there were no rooms on either side. It could be accessed via a lift but then (due to the disjointed nature of the buiding) we had to walk down a small spiral staircase and then up a few more stairs. This was no problem to us, but if you have any disabilities you should discuss the access to your room before booking. I am sure there are other rooms that are more easily accessed. The room was spacious, light and airy; and decorated in a very modern 'boutique' style - you can see the pics already provided by other travellers. The AC was appreciated in the heat, and the fridge/minibar also useful. There was a patio door at the side onto a small private roof terrace, which was very pleasant. The bathroom was small but functional, with a jacuzzi bath (which we didn't try) plus a shower. The staff were always smiling, helpful and polite, and the front desk staff speak excellent English. Note: you can buy tram tokens from reception (at cost price) and they will charge them to your bill if you wish...which is handy if you don't have change for the machines and want to avoid queuing. The breakfast buffet was more than adequate with lots of variety, and they seemed happy to accommodate special requests for other items made by other guests. My only complaint would be the lack of fresh fruit juices - which I had read in reviews before we travelled. They serve something that tastes like cordial, which is really not in line with the quality of the rest of the buffet. Free internet access 24/7 (throughout the hotel) was a real bonus. The roof top terrace is a wonderful place to relax with a glass of wine after a long day of sighseeing. The furniture is both stylish and comfortable and the views are stunning. This hotel does have a nice 'boutique' feel to it. It provides a more personal service and is intimate without being claustrophic. It has the advantage of (probably not) accommodating large groups - who can sometimes be a nuisance! It is well situated for walking to all the sights around the City, but do note that Istanbul is built on many hills and the cobbled streets and pavements can be quite arduous in the heat.

It is also in the old part of the City and the site of the Blue Mosque, so a great place to stay.

Your room also has a complimentary bottle of water daily, a very comfortable bed and on a wet day, the hotel gives you an umbrella. We ate at Khoransani (which we highly recommend), Sofyali 9 (good) and The Han (OK). To give balance to the review, you should note that you will hear the call to prayer at this location, so unless you are a heavy sleeper, expect to be woken, but that is all part of the experience. Whilst the hotel has a high standard of cleanliness, the bath in room 602 was not great. The finish was below standard and the the bath edge was not well maintained. There is a Bosphorus river trip for 10TL which is worth taking and do not bother with taxi's as public transport is good. Simit Sarayi is all over Istanbul and a good place for a quick snack.

My wife and I arrived at 6AM the day we were suppose to check-in. I had emailed the hotel prior to arrival and told them we were arriving early in the morning and were hoping to check-in early if possible. They said if a room is available, they would let us. When we arrived, we were extremely tired from the flight and our previous travels. Our room wasn't available yet, but the hotel gave us a temporary room downstairs (Room 102) at 6AM so we could go to sleep, use the restroom, use the shower, and just relax!! This is what I call service and taking care of your guests! What hotel lets you do that!? The staff was always very friendly and helpful when we had questions about something. They provided us with tram tokens which made using the tram easier. I would suggest keeping some extra tokens just in case cause you never know when you will need them (they just add the cost to your room). The tram is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel (to Sultanahmet Park and the Blue Mosque area). The staff called many places for us trying to make dinner reservations even just a few hours before we wanted to go for dinner. They moved our bags around when we needed and ALWAYS smiled. I cannot say enough about how polite each and every person was to us. The breakfast in the morning downstairs was amazing. They had cereal, eggs, fruit, yogurt, pastries, juice, coffee, and much more. That was the best watermelon I've ever had! There is also a computer downstairs if you want to use it. But the internet in our room worked excellent so we used our own laptop. Speaking of our room (room 302), it was extremely clean and well kept. The attention to detail, the design, and layout was excellent. We had a standard size room and it was just fine for us. The only issue I had was that the bathroom was a tad small for me since I am 6'1. The shower didn't have a lot of room to move around. The temporary room we stayed in was probably a Deluxe room and had a bigger shower/bathroom. I originally wanted to get a Deluxe room, but they were all booked. It was a small issue, but not a huge problem for me. The finishings in the bathroom and bedroom were top notch (I loved the light shade with the Mosque on it!).

For getting over to Beyoglu, the Bosphorus boat tours, and even simply to get over to the spice market for some shopping we often walked up from the hotel past the site of the Hippodrome and the Blue Mosque to the tramway, and for 2 TL took the very modern light rail transit, which was a breeze, except usually very crowded. What can you expect for a city with something like 15 million inhabitants? The Amira hotel staff were all very professional, yet each one seemed personable and friendly. We had lots of questions about where to eat in the evening and how to get around to see all the sights. They had great recommendations.

The rooftop is a nice place to sit and relax for an hour at sunset. It was extremely hot when we were there, (August) but we were having so much fun we just dealt with it. My only word of caution is to choose your restaurants wisely. Some of the ottoman cuisine is difficult to digest and kepap (kebab) is everywhere! We had the most fun hanging out withthe people celebrating in front of the Blue Mosque every night t the break of their fat since it a Ramadan. I have never met such incredibly nice--happy--generous people. They set up a temporary mall of wooden shops and every night we tasted treats like the best Baklava I ever tasted! (I don't generally like Baklava) For daytime--we had a personal guide that was amazing--I contracted Ozcan Bicer--but he was sick that day and sent his brother instead--His brother was fantastic, but unfortunately I forgot his name!!! We felt so badly for him since he couldn't eat or drink all day(Ramadan) in that heat & still insisted on taking us to lunch and sitting with us. We saw al the sight and he was incredibly knowledgeable and informative. Anyway I highly recommend the hotel and Ozcan Bicer's brother. (look up Istanbul guides for his email) Istanbul is GREAT! The Moslems who live there and conduct themselves with such grace, openness and peace--should be the example for Moslems throughout the world. The Hotel Amira is great value for the price we spent although i notice the prices are changing because of all the great reviews.

I was very pleased to find no evidence of the 'disappointing breakfast buffet and lack of choice at breakfast' referred to by some previous reviewers. In fact, we found the (inclusively priced) breakfast generous in the extreme: with an extensive range of cold and hot beverages and foods - certainly enough to cater for all tastes and appetites: including a choice of fruit juices, cereals, breads,cakes and patisseries, fresh fruit platter, fresh fruit salad, natural and fruit yoghurts, charcuterie, cheeses, olives, nuts, dried figs, dates and apricots, and a variety of prepared hot foods including scrambled and boiled eggs, sausages etc. The extremely pleasant and professional man in charge of breakfast who unobtrusively, efficiently ensured that our used dishes were promptly removed and the buffet was always freshly replenished: remembered after the first morning that I preferred tea in a teapot so had one freshly filled with my choice of tea whenever possible ready for me when I came to breakfast. The roof top restaurant at the Amira is a must for an evening drink to enjoy the view from a peaceful haven. We also dined there and although the menu is very limited (same menu as room service) - it was very fairly priced and great as a quiet and relaxing alternative to going out.

The hotel was a 5 minute walk from the Blue Mosque and the tram line that goes through the middle of Sultanahmet and across the Galata bridge.

Of course our rooms were not yet ready, but the hotel let us use their wonderful wellness center free of charge even though we probably went through at least six towels and bathrobes and spent an hour or so in there. The breakfast served every morning was great, and so was the rooftop terrace where you could enjoy a drink or have a meal. The service on the rooftop was also impeccable, as my father and I were on the terrace late one night when a group of drunken, loud hotel guests joined us. A staff person asked if they would like anything (even though I'm sure it was after hours) and rushed off to fulfill their requests after being treated quite curtly and rudely. Only downside was that the rooms and amenities in them were not super fancy ... definitely very nice, but not what you would find in a super upscale, five-star hotel. One of our rooms had air-conditioning that did not work consistently and the other had a shower that did not drain properly.

We had a room on the 3rd floor for the first and 1st floor for the 2nd visit. Neither room suffered from either hotel or street room. The windows are so well sound-proofed that we would have to open them to hear the call to prayer which we came to love hearing (couldn't hear with windows closed). The rooms were modern, air-conditioned, nicely decorated, the shower strong, the Wifi steady and strong (iMac in breakfast/leisure room). The rooms have safes big enough for laptops and iPhone players/chargers in the room. The ATM on premises was helpful. There is a taxi stand right outside the hotel which was convenient and the hotel watched over the guys who lined up so you had sure service when using them. We ended up using the Tram so much though as it was safe, fast (often faster than the taxi through traffic), clean and cheap. Just 10 minutes up the road to the closest Tram stop. Reviewers keep talking about how difficult the uphill walk is. it isn't THAT uphill or difficult and we're in our mid-50s. Good exercise. Istanbul is on 7 hills so there are hills and up-hill walks everywhere.

He's a quirky little fella, but he'll do anything for you once he's won you over. He even took us to the local DHL office and helped us pack up and ship a number of items back to the states.

The staff were attentive, the rooms attractive, breakfast was nice, and the beds comfortable. Potential guests should be aware of one drawback with the deluxe rooms. We had organized our trip to have deluxe rooms at Amira because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and because the rooms were significantly larger than rooms in other hotels in Istanbul. However, the rooms we were shown, while large, were in the basement and one of them smelled distinctly musty. The other room had only very small, high windows, so it had very little natural light, and also smelled faintly of basement must. After some discussion with the staff, we eventually switched to smaller standard rooms on a higher floor (one the first night, and the other the second), and that was much better. I do find it disappointing that these basement rooms were being sold on the basis of their space without mention of the drawbacks.

Breakfasts were superb, especially, from my point of view, the yoghurt, hazlenuts and fruit salads, and the tahina. They were only slightly marred by not providing inclusive fruit juices, just some kind of sweetened squash. Although breakfast theoretically finished at 10.30, there was no problem or rushing of people who arrived late. The computer in the breakfast room, and the well-chosen collection of books, were very helpful. The fitness centre (gym) is tiny - two treadmills, a cycling machine and some free weights - but clean, equipped with towels, and adequate for a quick workout. We didn't use the spa area, as we tried the historic hamams. (There is one three minutes' walk away from the Amira.) The location is good, with a taxi rank and small shops outside, and a choice of restaurants nearby. Best of all though, were the staff - so friendly, so helpful, so courteous, knowing always exactly how to treat you well. On arrival, we were given a personal introduction to Istanbul.

The other reviews tell you all the good points, so I will just add a couple of tiny caveats. I booked their 30-euro shuttle form the airport to the hotel. That was excellent. For the return, they were honest enough to tell me that hopping in a cab at the rank right outside would be cheaper - which it would have been, if the driver had not stiffed me when we got to the airport. What was supposed to be 35 TL ride became 50 TL. I assumed that because the porter had called the driver over I would be OK - don't let your guard down like me. Also, all the TV channels are news channels. One movie channel would be nice... Sultanahmet is notorious for poor restaurants.

Within walking distance at every touristic site of Sultanahmet (Top Kapi, Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque) and 15-20 minutes walking from Galata Bridge. Rooms are wonderfully decorated, very clean and if i must find a fault is the fact that they are small (we stayed at a double standard room). And finally a detail that might concern travelers from Greece is the fact that at the concierge is working a girl that speaks Greek (Her name is Natali).

At arrival all guests are invited to a welcome drink in the hotel's bar (or even breakfast for early arrivals, which wasn't our case though) while a member of the staff provides maps, activities' leaflets and an amazingy good advise on things to do and places to go, which we found extremely helpful throughout our stay.

The free wi-fi connection offered in all rooms at times worked quite slowly if it worked at all, but this could be easily solved by using the shared computer in the bar area.

I am convinced that without their good offices we would not have secured a table in some of the restaurants we wanted to go to.

The rooms are lovely (my children had standard rooms which they pronounced excellent) with the superior being more spacious (strangely though my daughter's standard room had a bath whereas our superior did not).

We were NOT disappointed. Hotel Amira lived up to its TA reputation in every way. Prior to our visit, I mentioned it was a surprise birthday trip and to my surprise was presented a very nice handmade, traditional backgammon set, along with a nice birthday note. It was the first time in my many travels that a hotel had provided such a personal touch and kind gesture--which really set the tone for a pleasant stay. After a bit of difficulty linking up with our driver, and a bizarre trip from the airport, we were greeted warmly upon arrival by Ferhat and another gentlemen, who offered us a nice drink, showed us the property (up on the lovely patio) and gave us a brief tour of Istanbul by map--which included several recommendations. The deluxe room was clean, well-appointed and comfortable, with modern bathroom fittings and a jacuzzi tub (a bit too small for two, however ;) Ours had a small patio with a slight view of the Bosporus and the immediate surroundings. The location can't be beat, with the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Arasta Bazaar all within minutes (walking) and much more within easy reach by tram or taxi. We had a wonderful dinner at Pasazade (also highly rated by TA) as well at the Aloran Cafe (down near the Four Seasons Hotel), recommended to us by Ferhat. There are several small bars and cafes just up the street from the hotel, and many more within walking distance. I had seen several posts complaining about the breakfast, but I can tell you that I saw nothing worth complaining about. The dining area is nice, and there was a plentiful spread of scrambled eggs, breakfast meats, fresh fruits, pastries, cheeses and vegetables--something for everyone--every morning. And the tea and coffee was plentiful. Perhaps this was all in response to earlier grumblings, but I was pleased, nonetheless. The only thing I would suggest is to either take the train from the airport (Attaturk) to Sultanhamet, look for a more reasonably priced transfer company (there were several advertising near the hotel) or even a taxi. We booked the airport transfer through the hotel and although comfortable and reliable, found it a bit pricey at 60EUR considering the relatively short length of the journey.

Everything about the hotel screams first class, from the provided toiletries to the fully-stocked mini-bar and the incredible spread of a breakfast presented each morning. I didn't have a chance to check out the spa, but the rooftop terrace and breakfast room are beautifully furnished (the rooftop terrace was South Beach chic ... and I'm from there). The only thing that isn't five-star are the prices. The room rate ... and even the mini bar prices ... are beyond reasonable. Throughout my stay, I was always greeted with a smile by the staff. Knowing I was a photographer, Kamer and Kartal, the General Manager, showed me their collection of books from a Turkish photographer. When I decided to take tea or a glass of wine in the lounge, it was always brought to me with a warm smile. Istanbul is one of the most extraordinary places I've visited, and the Amira is it's best hotel.

The location is top notch - 5 minutes (though sharp uphill there, but downhill back) walk to Sultanahment (Blue) Mosque, and an additional 3-5 to Hagia Sophia and the Basilica Cistern, as well as Sultanahment tram stop. Many restaurants within walking distance, and a view of both the minarets of the Blue Mosque and the Sea of Marmara from the lovely rooftop terrace. Check out Kucuk Aya Sofya Mosque - it's the minaret you see while looking towards the Sea of Marmara. Just a few minutes walk away and nearly empty of tourists, this is a nice little mosque to see to escape the crowds, and the Imam is very friendly and welcoming of tourists. The staff - fantastic. From the porters to the front desk staff to the bartenders/restaurant staff to the housekeeping staff, all are extremely friendly and always willing to help. Their English is excellent, and they are clearly professionals at their trade. The rooms - very comfortable. Beds are on the firmer side, but if you like (as I do), you will be in heaven. TV choices are decent, though only a few English choices. However, if you are watching TV too much, you are clearly missing out on one of the greatest cities in the world. The hotel overall - WiFi is free and quick. Rates are very attractive considering service, location and overall comfort. Rooftop terrace offers a beautiful place to relax and watch the world go by, or a stunning sunset to the west over the Sea of Marmara and outskirts of Istanbul. Airport transfers very nice and reasonable considering you get a private ride - 30 EUR to Ataturk, and 60-70 EUR to Sabiha Gokcen. If I had to fault anything, and I am pushing it here, it's the food. That being said, the (free!) breakfast is far from bad! Typical European buffet with meats, cheeses and breads. Dinner at the hotel, while good, was not great - there are tons of hotels in the area with better food at more reasonable prices.

When I first reserved this hotel, it was ranked 10th because, well, it hadn't been open for very long. But every one of the 15 reviewers raved about the place, and they were right. Because it's only been open for a short period of time, everything is NEW, from the bathtubs to the beds to the air conditioning. There is literally no wear and tear. Also, this is the first time in all my years of booking hotels online where the pictures on the hotel website are what the place actually looks like (unlike some hotels that basically post only their best looking, most expensive room complete with the benefit of good camera lighting and angles). What you see is actually what you get. This is a modern hotel, but it isn't a crazy modern hotel with an odd-shaped wicker basket plonked in the middle of your room just because it's \"boutique\"-y. The rooftop terrace is fantastic and totally chill. The front desk guys are so helpful and genuinely nice that you want to hug them after every interaction. Artur at the front desk especially was the best - he even recommended a restaurant where he threw his sister's engagement party. And the restaurant was great! Unlike many establishments in Turkey, you never feel like they are trying to sell you something you don't want or trying to pull one over on you. And free wireless, free wireless, free wireless. There are two minor detractions: first, the walk towards all the sites in Sultanhament, while close (8 minute walk) is an uphill walk (but at the end of the day, when you are tired and sweaty, the walk back to the hotel is thus, downhill); second, the free breakfast is a little weird. There's a LOT of food, but I wasn't a fan of what appeared to be the typical continental Turkish breakfast. But again these two things are minor. I saw a lot of crappy hotels abounding in the Sultanhamet. If you don't want to feel cheated in Istanbul, book this hotel.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we made the switch! From the moment we checked in, the service was very professional, accommodating, and helpful. Immediately after we checked in they provided us with a very detailed map of the city and a brief overview of the city to be our bearings.

The rooms are very modern\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we had been on the Aegean coast before arriving and were really happy to find a comfortable bed with good pillows. Breakfast was awesome! I was particularly fond of the fresh fruit, yogurt, and honey while my husband tended to like the cheese and bread selection. The breakfast was beyond what we heard was the typical turkish breakfast of white bread, tomatoes, olives, and etc. My only negative comment about the hotel was one (and the only) restaurant recommendation they provided us\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it was for Tamara which is a block or so away. The food at Tamara wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommendation-worthy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and we thought there might be some connection between the hotel and restaurant.

The hotel sent a van to the port to pick up the 4 of us after our cruise, and we got to the hotel around 10 a.m. Of course, our rooms were not ready that early, but Kartal the manager and Arthur and the rest of the staff were extremely hospitable and brought us cold lemonade and let us rest in the sunroom off the restaurant, as we settled in. They offered to let us have the sumptuous breakfast as well, but we had already had breakfast on the ship. There was free internet in the dining room/ cafe. A very nice perk. The room for the ladies was ready first, so they settled in. As we were waiting for our room, Arthur told us that his mother worked at an antique shop just outside the Grand Bazaar, and she could direct us to a good place for lunch. At the antique shop where Arthur's mother Perihan works, we marveled at the gorgeous antique coin gold jewelry and other antiques. Perihan recommended the Aslan restaurant nearby, where we had delicious Bonita fish with vegetables and tomato sauce with herbs. Good house wine too. Great Turkish hospitality! Our guide, Dr. Gunhan Borecki, met us at the hotel the next day. He has a Ph.D. from Ohio State in Ottoman Studies, so he speaks excellent English and has an incredible knowledge of Istanbul and Turkish history. He took us to the Hippodrome, Blue Mosque, and Haggia Sophia, as well as lunch at Asmali Restaurant on the terrace. The Archaeology Museum and Topkapi Palace ended the tour. The following day Gunhan took us by van to the Dolmabahce Palace, the old Byzantine Palace, Pannokaristos Church, and lunch at Asitane, where they have the historic dishes of the Ottoman Empire. The last stops were the Mosaic Museum and shops where we got Turkish Delight and pistachios. A wonderful two days! Having Gunhan really maximized our visit and allowed us to see everything we wanted to see. Well worth it. Our brand new, \"deluxe\" rooms were very contemporary, with red leather sofa and stylish shag rug. King bed, desk/ dressing table, and small round table and chair. They just have king beds in the deluxe rooms, however, but they brought in another bed for the ladies, since they liked the room better than the standard room that had twin beds. Our room was on the corner and had a balcony with 2 chairs and table, with a view of the city out the front and the sea to the left. The traffic went past, as it was on the front of the hotel, but it was not too bad. The room was spacious. The bath was not large, but all brand new and very clean. The closet was just outside the bathroom, so you could put everything in there that you could not fit into the bathroom. No shelves except for towels, but it did have nice hooks. The breakfast was wonderful-- eggs, sausages, and all sorts of sweet rools and breads, with huge figs and fruits and cheeses. It was included in the price as well! The staff were so lovely and helpful. The restaurant is open for dinner, and one night for dinner we had a very good mixed grill with kebobs of all kinds. The chicken kebobs were good too. The server could not have been nicer, and very efficient, serving the whole room! The hotel arranged for a van to take us to the airport the last morning. The traffic is very bad in Istanbul, so make sure to allow some extra time just in case there is a lot of traffic. He was there around 10 minutes after the appointed time because of the traffic, but we had allowed plenty of time, and our flight was an hour late leaving anyway!

Having said that, while one can always visit other rooftop restaurants or bars (such as Seven Hills) to get a great a view, I suspect that there are few hotels which can trump the Amira in other respects. Now for a couple of minor negatives. The breakfast selection is the same every day, which can be boring by the 3rd day. Also, some of the staff tend to forget to give fundamental information when advising guests (eg it is better to walk than to take taxis in Sultanhamet and Eminonu due to intense traffic, and one should go earlier than usual to the airport due to baggage screening procedures).

The staff is perhaps the best thing in this hotel. They are young and highly professional. As soon as we arrived they showed us the hotel and invited us to a drink in the roof terrace while they gave us a map and provided us will all kind of useful information. The last day they also allowed us to stay in our room until we left to the airport at no additional cost. In conclusion, it made our stay in Istanbul great.

We enjoyed it, and would go again. 2 relatively minor concerns: The muezzin - the callers/singers for daily prayers - can be heard in the hotel rooms (at least, on the side we were on, which is the preferred side, as it the one furthest from a busy road), even with all windows closed. This can get old at 5am. Food in Sultanahmed is not the best to put it mildly (Beyoglu and the asian side are much better).

In one word: awesome. I (a 30 year old female from the United States) recently traveled to Istanbul with one other girlfriend. We travel to different locations every year and use Trip Advisor to find local boutique hotels that will provide us with a pleasant local experience. Hotel Amira is at the top of our list of overall favorites. In a nutshell: hotel is great, location is great, rooms are great, breakfast is great, price is great, and staff is better-than-great. Would highly recommend. Hotel Itself: This hotel was just renovated and opened a few months ago. The owners did a great job of redoing the building...giving it modern amenities while maintaining (@ least the pretense) of old-school Turkish charm. The decor is very nice, and the common areas are pleasant. The dining room is big with comfy, attractive seating. There is a computer (Mac) available for anyone's use (which prints to the front desk). There is an ever-presently staffed bar with a spread of drinks (which you can order and have served to you anywhere in the hotel). And there is a great selection of provided books (from Istanbul and Turkey travel guides, to history of Turkish politics, to photographic depictions of life in Istanbul) which you can peruse @ your leisure. There is also a set of very nice public restrooms available throughout the day. Downstairs there is a spa and workout facility. We never ended up using the spa, but we did tour though it and it looked very nice. Upstairs there is terrace with a lot of comfy seating. It is gorgeous during the day and at night. They offer the services of a waiter almost continuously throughout the day, so you can always order beverages and relax in a beautiful setting. And finally, they have both stairs and an elevator, so you can choose your method of getting from one place to the next. Location: For tourists, this hotel is fabulously located. Tucked in a cute neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops, only a 5 min walk from the Blue Mosque, Sultanhamet Square, the Hagia Sophia, the Cisterns, and Topkai Palace, the location couldn't be better for conveniently taking in the sights of Old Istanbul. Additionally, cabs pick up right outside the hotel doors, and public transport isn't too far away. So, you can also get to all the other great parts of Istanbul you'd like to explore. We ate at a couple of good restaurants in the area that had nice Turkish fare (recommended by the hotel). Rooms: The rooms are very nice and are stocked full of the little things that really make a boutique experience (nice hard wood floors, modern furniture pieces, comfy beds with smooth sheets, reading lights above each bed/each side of bed, great air conditioning, safe that was easy to use and effective, stocked mini-bar, a fresh water each day, a great shower with awesome temp and wonderful pressure (and two shower heads!), a fabulous jetted tub, a towel warmer, hair dryer, body scrubber, full set of adorable toiletries, robes for each person in the room, extra q-tips and cotton balls (yay ladies!), etc etc. The list goes on and on. Breakfast: The breakfast is included in your room price. And is great. Big, diverse spread. Pleasant atmosphere. Eager staff. Staff: Not sure if it's the result of a great training program or the genuine niceness of the people working at the hotel, but I left Amira feeling like I had made friends with the staff rather than just cooly interacted with them. Kudos to management for fostering such a great employee presentation. There was @ least one person staffing the front desk 24 hours a day. And the Staffer was always friendly and upbeat (as opposed to some hotels where they make you feel guilty after coming in at a certain time). As single girls in a foreign country it was nice knowing that we could go out @ night and come back to someone waiting up for us at the hotel! They gave us a personal, pleasant, and on-time wake-up call each morning. They ordered all of our cabs for us, and even went so far so to tell the driver exactly where we wanted to go, equip us with a business card so the cabbie would know where to bring us upon our return, and tell us, in advance, how much the cab would be. They were never wrong. Special Mentions: Arthur was our main during-the-day front desk man and he was great...warm, friendly and informative. Emre, our main late-night-man, was sweet as pie and always (@ least seemingly!) very happy to see us. And Ferhat, our smile-all-the-time man, made our days with his ever-present adorable cheese.

The hotel was an oasis after this ordeal, which was bright and airy, modern and new. We were greeted warmly by the staff upon arrival, and given a brief orientation of the city and tour of the hotel. The rooms are chic, spacious and unique \u00e2\u20ac\u201c each with hand-painted ceilings, sleek furniture and modernized paintings of old Istanbul. The bathroom was well equipped with a Jacuzzi tub and an excellent shower. As other reviewers have mentioned, everything in the hotel is very clean and new, making it feel as though you are the first guest to be in your room. The hotel breakfast buffet is quite extensive, with an array of local cheeses, meats, olives, fruits, pastries and breads to choose from. Hot items, such as eggs and sausages are also offered. In addition, the hotel has a full bar and an a la carte menu. The food selection and quality, especially for a hotel of its size, was quite impressive. Location-wise, the hotel is a well situated in the Sultanahmet neighborhood, a safe, residential area with charming cobblestone streets and old wooden houses. It is within a 5-10 minute walk of key tourist sites (e.g., Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia), but far enough away you can enjoy peace and quiet when you want to relax. Whenever we needed a taxi, there were always a few ready and waiting outside the hotel. The staff was very helpful, polite and kind to us during our stay. Most of the staff are fluent in English, and were more than happy to help out whenever we needed a dinner reservation, sightseeing advice or travel assistance. In many cases, I felt as though the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and ensure we were enjoying our stay. The fact the hotel is family run, shows in their warmth and hospitality.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft Walton Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location and Hotel\u201d", "Author": "charlie2407", "ReviewID": "UR69788290", "Content": "The Hotel Amira is within walking distance of many of the major attractions.

The hotel is wonderfully positioned for all of the tourist attractions, and just a stone's throw away from the Blue Mosque for example. Great staff, very helpful and lovely modern, clean rooms with excellent bathrooms. This is a family owned and run hotel, and they definitely make sure that they look after you!
