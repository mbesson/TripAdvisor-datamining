Some rooms had a small bathroom, others did not, the shower was a challenge but got you clean.Breakfast was not a feast or for the health conscious but the cappuccino was good and a second cup not a problem.If you want a cheap, no frills hotel near the station  not too far from the sights stay here, If you want more don't!", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR406088153", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "steveolucci"}, {"Content": "Simple but really budget and comfortable I didn't read TripAdvisor reviews before booking Hotel Erina...and I'm pretty happy of my choice!The hotel is completely refurbished and shows a nice and personal style. The real plus of this small hotel was its location, 10 minutes from Florence main monuments, and a stone's throw from CAF tours I really appreciated (don't miss the Chianti, I want to live there one day!)Very spacious (completely different from European standards), spotlessly clean rooms. The staff seemed really polite and always at disposal (I'm not the kind of traveler with 10 thousand requests, though).I think this is a great choice for families and travelers that seek comfort most of all.

I'm very glad I didn't! We arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in time at the hotel (3:30pm). They were kind enough to clean our room first and have us in by 1:30. After reading the review we were vigilent about bad smells and other unsanitary problems...we didn't find any of these problems. There was a bad smell a few hotels down though. The hotel is very close to the train station and is just outside of an area where buses park..so I am not suprised that such problems could exist. However, no problems on the day we were there. The room was beautifully decorated. Large and clean. In fact, we were given a triple room for the price of a double. The shower was tiny, but this is not the first time I have seen such a small shower in Italy. The bathroom looked new and was pleasantly decorated also. Breakfast was ok, simple but good enough. Staff was helpful in regards to questions about how to find places. We were given a map with directions. Various tourist information was made available. The only problem that I should mention is that I did find ants in the room. About 1/2 an hour before we were to check out. I did have sweets in my backpack..which may have attracted them...but I was dismayed none the less. No apologies were made for this problem...just a comment about letting the manager know. If I were to stay again I'd look really close for ants before checking in for good!", "Date": "Jun 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR417786958", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "TravelingEurope2007"}, {"Content": "Pleasantly surprised We stayed at Hotel Erina in May 2007. We are a family of 4 that was traveling through Italy via train. Hotel Erina was very conveniently located around the corner from the train station. A big plus when you have 4 people all pulling suitcases! It is kind of a boutique hotel that is located on the 3rd floor of an office building. Very small. Front desk help was always very friendly and helpful. Room was perfect for what we needed it for ...sleep. As a family of 4 it is often hard to find a hotel. The Quad room at the Erina was just right. A double bed for me and my husband and single beds for our children. Breakfast was typical European (meat, cheese, yogurt, fruit). The cappachino was excellent! This is not a high end hotel but it is perfect for the traveler that will be spending most of their time out sightseeing and needs a good bed to sleep in at night.", "Date": "May 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR680173430", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "FitMom2"}, {"Content": "Buyer Beware! This hotel does not offer what it promises on its website. The hotel is part of a consortium of hotels that advertise Florence accommodation and hence a generic posting is made; however, one is led to believe that the hotel you are booking into can offer many amenities, such as laundry facilties, phone in the room, internet connnections, night watchman, 24 hour reception, in room safe, air conditioning - none of which was actually available. We had booked into this hotel as part of a last minute deal. We had a terrible 2 days stay at this hotel. The first morning we attended breakfast at 8.45 am, only to learn that there was no more cereals, the cold meat was finished and we got what seemed to be the left over croiisants from another visitors bread basket. When we enquired about restocking the cereals and meats we were met by a disinterested shrug by the gum chewing girl who was serving. Our shower had a black film of soap scum all around the edge and when we complained to the owner about this, he denied that it was dirt and said that it was black plastic sealant (which seems to dissolve when you spray hot water on to it ...) We noticed however that later that day that shower had had a film of white sealant added to it - and this time it really was sealant!The hotel is situated on the third floor and the lift was out of order for most of the time that we were there.The area outside of the hotel, although conveniently close to the station had a very strong smell of urine around it. When we arrived back in the evening there was a used syringe on the stairs.When we checked out we confronted the owner about his misleading advertising. His reply was that the laundrette was about 3 street blocks away from the hotel, similarly there was an internet cafe further down the street and we have our own mobile phones, why would we want to use a room phone then? He became very rude and insisted that there was nothing wrong with his hotel, stating that after all, we had paid a lower rate and should therefore be satisfied with what we got. He even added that seeing as we got 2 cappucinos at breakfast we should consider ourselves doubly privileged to have stayed at his hotel. Needless to say , we did not get an apology or amendment to the bill to compensate for a very bad experience. Do not stay at this hotel, even if you are offered discount rates, it definitely is not worth it.", "Date": "May 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR358767788", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Deonette"}, {"Content": "not even fit for my dog From the internet description it looked great but it was terrible.I chose it for its location near the railway station.The entrance was thru a courtyard (smelly) into an antique elevator, hotel was on third floor of the building.
