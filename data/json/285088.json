We stayed one night here this time and the booking was again made by a travel agency. It is supposed to be a 4* hotel but it is not. It is ok for 3 stars but it does not deserve the fourth one and I wonder why the star is still on. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that the bed was comfortable and there was nothing to impress us. It is quite far from the main tourist sites, - a 45 minute drive to come to Venice. The hotel though is clean, but the staff is not that professional. Breakfast is continental. Restaurant food in the hotel was less than continental and if you come here with a group as we did, it is even worse. It was disappointing. Wi Fi internet connection is not free, and it is not that cheap as well if you decide to get a card. There is a bus stop near the hotel (bus route 2) going to Venice. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this hotel to people who travel on their own for they should certainly book in Venice itself. Convenient though for groups who come in coaches and can park easily the coach in the parking lot. I can recommend it as a basic place to stay and then move on.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHotel Albatros, Mestre, Venice\u201d", "Author": "404Robert404", "ReviewID": "UR124799000", "Content": "This was our first trip to Venice, and i was apprehensive as some of the reviews for this hotel were not good on this site. However, we were pleasantly surprised. We had a very large room in Art Deco style with an enourmous bed! Comfort of public areas was good, although the lighting in the restaurant, which doubled as a breakfast room was far too bright - More ambient, subdued lighting is needed for evening dining, and a slightly more extended and varied menu would be better too! Our room was situated at the rear of the hotel, and i think this was a bonus as the main road in front seemed quite noisy with a fair amount of traffic, we decided not to stay in Venice itself as we didn't want any noise disturbance. The Hotel advertised the bar was open until midnight, but on the second evening we decided to have a drink after dinner, but it was closed at 22.30! We asked reception if we could have a drink only to be told it was closed, but there was a bar across the road we could go to. I have to say it was open late every night after that, so maybe others complained! The staff in the restaurant and reception were helpful, and we found it a great base to stay. There is a bus stop about a minutes walk away and buses leave every 15 mins to take you into the centre of Venice which is around 20 mins away. All in all, a great four night stay, and i would reccommend this for a pleasant vacation.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTerrible cleanliness, bedbugs in at least two rooms\u201d", "Author": "NormaBriz", "ReviewID": "UR120176791", "Content": "The general aspect pf the rooms old and dirty, we find a sock in the closet and bedbugs.

Yes, it is in the suburbs and if you arrive on a Sunday the area is deserted as the locals go out for the day with their families The hotel exterior is unprepossessing and the reception is dated however, it is clean and bright. The room we stayed in was small but comfortable and clean. The air conditioning worked well. There were no real views to be had apart from other residences. The restaurant is clean and bright, the food provided as part of the tour was basic. Think school dinners! The food combinations were\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6unusual. Such as roast pork, gravy and iceberg lettuce with grated carrot. (Opposite the hotel is a pizzeria.) When we arrived at the hotel it was mid afternoon and we needed lunch. The hotel does have a bar menu but, it was expensive. We ventured out despite other reviews claiming there is nothing we found a small Italian place. The locals went there to read the newspapers. We had a tasty cheese and ham \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and drink for very little indeed. (Exit the hotel turn left, walk down the road towards the bus stop. The place is on the crossroads in front. 3 minutes walk.) Across the road is a small supermarket which will open on Monday morning just in time for you to pick up some provisions. Behind the hotel is a park with a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playground in it, apart from this you could go for a walk or there is a small area outside the hotel where you can have a drink. There are quite a lot of mosquitoes around so bring some repellent.
