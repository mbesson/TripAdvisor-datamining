Love that they provided you free local newspaper every morning. This really feels like home for me. Despite got a bit bored with having eggs every monring for breakfast, I had a very pleasant stay at the Wangz Hotel. Oh, the only thing should be improved is that there is no socket in the bathroom.

I do this 4 times per year so have consequently stayed at many hotels across Asia, especially in Singapore. As a solo traveller, there are several things I look for when booking a hotel; cleanliness, security, comfort, internet access and value for money. Wangz fulfilled these criteria and more. Being a small hotel the staff were able to give one the impression of personal service rather than being another source of income on the conveyor belt of tourists in a larger impersonal hotel. The room was immaculate (no hesitation to do yoga on the floor), the bed a welcome comfort, the included extras such as breakfast (perfectly good enough), internet access and mini bar were just what I needed to handle the jet-lag. There are many restaurants in the vicinity including some good cafes on Tiong Poh Road and Eng Hoon Street. Head further afield into Chinatown if you are looking for vegetarian food. Buses are cheap and efficient (you can buy a transport card at the Cheers convenience store 100m from Wangz) and stop outside the hotel. Don't let the location with major roads running past the hotel be a deterrent. Unless you are used to living in a country location with no traffic noise, then this won't be a problem. The rooms are well sound proofed. Ear plugs are wise accessories when traveling and at Wangz I felt safe enough to use them enabling me to sleep long and deep.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgreat staff\u201d", "Author": "Sallytompkins", "ReviewID": "UR126373793", "Content": "i enjoyed my stay at he wangz hotel, the staff were fantastic, very welcoming and helpful, the rooms, clean, modern and very comfortable. hotel shuttle service was great. on the down side i had a room with mesh covering window, so no view.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cMi encanta / i love it\u201d", "Author": "izizwan", "ReviewID": "UR126099980", "Content": "General: The hotel is perfect for those who are looking for a quality boutique hotel .

The included breakfast was good but nothing spectacular - better to grab some Chinese food next door. The one thing to keep in mind in Singapore - it rains and rains a lot.

Since it was a personal staycation, I thoroughly enjoyed reading by the window on the single chair and sipping my fave coffee. You can find Molton Brown as part of the shower amenities. Some drinks are complimentary (apart from water). Breakfast selection is limited but it's probably due to the small number of rooms/guests as well. I had bread and pastries, cereal, fruits and coffee, which made my day anyway. I checked out the rooftop bar on level 7. It has a panoramic view of the expressway and the Outram area. Quite lovely to wind down after a long day. Across the road are some indie cafes that I always love. Forty Hands and Orange Thimble are two of my faves. I wouldn't walk from the MRT as they're both quite a distance away. I took bus 63 from Tiong Bahru MRT (2 bus stops) and it stopped right in front of the hotel. Bus 33 goes there too. From the same bus stop, you have access to town as well. I saw signs of free shuttle to various tourist attractions from the hotel but didn't get to take it.

DVD's available from reception. You should probably keep in mind that you need to close the blinds in the room at night, unless you like scaring the people outside... I believe there's a small gym downstairs too, but I did not use it. Breakfast was ok. Singapore is a food mecca anyway, so go and explore. One of the best steamed bun shops in the city is right next door too, and there's several seafood restaurants within a 3 minute walk. Bus stop outside. Or grab a taxi if you'd prefer. The underground is around a 15 minute walk away. The location's not perfect for most tourists, but Singapore's easy enough and small enough to get around wherever you end up staying. A 10 minute SGD$10 taxi ride may save you a couple of hundred on a similar room elsewhere. One of the best clubs in Singapore - Zouk - is just down the street too.

And 2) An all-day breakfast option and extended room service hours. 24/7 room service, even with limited choice, would certainly upgrade the product.

The partially enclosed rooftop bar and restaurant has great night views of the Singapore skyline and the food is a first-rate mix of French and Asian cuisine. The complimentary breakfast had a great selection of fruit, pastries, cereals, bacon and even smoked salmon. Eggs and omelettes can be ordered to taste and so can espresso coffee. An excellent selection of new age and easy rock music is played in the lobby restaurant, the rooftop patio bar, and in the rooms (where you can adjust the volume or turn it off). On the downside, there is no readily visible front entrance, as the building is squeezed into a triangle at the intersection of two busy streets. What entrance you can find is hidden up a flight of stairs and is not well marked. Our taxi driver had to circle the hotel a couple of times to find out where to park. The taxi drop-off is accessed via the basement off a little lane behind the hotel. Inside is parking for only a few cars. A poorly marked doorway leads to the elevator that takes you up to the lobby. There is a larger parking lot across the street for those with their own car. Once you have checked in, however, excellent service and quality take over. Staff are friendly, efficient and welcoming. Access to your room is secured by placing your room key over a small pad on the elevator control panel. This is to prevent restaurant and bar patrons from accessing the guest rooms. It\u2019s a nice comforting feature. On the third floor the hum of traffic from the two busy streets was drowned out by the A/C fan and we slept quite well. The ultra-modern glass-wall shower and bathroom were spacious, bright and clean, and a rain showerhead provided lots of hot water and good pressure. One of the best features was the way staff treated us like friends or regular guests. There were always attentive, friendly and addressed us by name after the first day.

It's not bad to walk if it's not too hot, but a bit tiring when dragging the luggage. Room design (though with a \"unique\" L-shaped layout) is quite nice, with complimentary soft drinks and WIFI as well as breakfast. However, the biggest problem was the WIFI in Room 201. The signal was simply too weak, I could hardly connect to the internet, or even search the network. Before I went out of the hotel, I called the front desk to check. In late evening, unfortunately, it was not still working. The front desk claimed to have tested in the afternoon which should be working. Since the problem persisted, the front desk offered me to have another check again the next day, which was totally understanding at 23:XX. The front desk promised me to have someone to check at around 09:00-10:00 when IT returned to duty. The next day after breakfast, I called the front desk again. To my surprise, the answer to my problem about weak WIFI was due to certain error of the router. From that moment, I doubted if they did check the day before or just fooling me around. Anyway, they offered me to have room move to another room 205. This is much better one in terms of layout which is rectangular so more practical. WIFI signal was luckily strong enough for normal browsing. I did appreciate the effort of trying to rectify the problem. Overall, I quite enjoyed my stay (in room 205). In particular, I like the iPod docking with remote control so I can control the music without the need of sitting in front of the desk.

The staff was attentive and even walked to the lift to offer help plus carry my bag for me. Room 501 was good sized with 2 super comfy single beds; fitting in also was a nice writing desk and also another couch-like chair with a clothes rack. The bathroom was nice, albeit a little on the small side. I love the Molten Brown toiletries! There's also a DVD player and ipod player in the room, plus an alarm which i didnt use. One of the pillow case was stained but they very quickly changed it after we called. Requests for ice buckets, extra toiletries etc was also responded to fast. Some of the mini bar drinks were complimentary which I thought was nice. Also free wireless in the room but sometimes the signals are quite weak, depending on which spot in the hotel you're at. No pool, but a very small gym which looked very un-used. There's only 2 dining options in the hotel - Nectar at the lobby level (breakfast venue too) and a rooftop bar Halo. The bar is quite a nice place for chilling out if you get a nice breeze going. Otherwise, a big local market is available 5mins walk away. I was prepared for a sad breakfast spread after reading the reviews and it was indeed quite sad. You get 1 order of your choice of eggs and sausages etc, and the rest of the spread was simple stuff like porridge, one type of dim sum, a small cheese platter, smoked salmon, cold cuts. There's of course fruits, cereals, and coffee/tea. Nothing fanciful but I actually think it fills you up suitably. I have this review as average although I think the rooms are quite good due to its location. I'm a local so its not so bad, but for visitors it may be abit boring here. No shopping within walking distance, although there's Chinatown but a good 3-4 bus stops away. The hotel is also about 10-15mins walk away from the nearest MRT, Outram. If the weather is hot, the walk will feel much longer.

Room is nice, it is surrounded by glass wall which you could just pull down the curtains for privacy. For other times, having the curtain opens makes the rooms looks roomy and pleasant. Breakfast was OK. Pretty plain. They served breads, salad, eggs & some cereal. The nearest station would be Outram, it take around 10mins walk. Front Office staff is pretty attentive, i was mumbling about not having small notes to my partner, the front office lady first reaction was to offered changing the big notes for me. I would love to give a big thumbs up for this.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cClean and modern\u201d", "Author": "Chase1979", "ReviewID": "UR100908125", "Content": "Spend 1 night at Canopy Room, room is consider big for a boutique hotel.

Don't be put off by what some people say about the breakfast, as it's plentiful, decent quality and has a reasonable selection of Western fare and not too much Chinese! Fresh fruit which varies each day, 3 types of cereal, choice of pastries (which you can heat up in a little oven), choice of bread for toast and choice of cooked eggs with bacon/sausage etc from the chef. Also good coffee and as much as you like. We didn't eat here for dinner but many locals do as they had a 2 for 1 mains special on and I heard people saying that the food was good. The cocktail bar upstairs was a little noisy for our taste but seemed popular with the local ladies (good place for guys to visit maybe!!). Our room was lovely. We were on the second floor and had a great shower and oh so comfortable bed. We'd just spent three weeks on mostly very hard beds around India and slept for 12 hours the first night, which was just amazing after having had uncomfortable nights elsewhere. Really close to the Outram Park MRT, just a 5-10 mins walk and mostly in shade, so no sweats there. Very close to Harbourfront, just one stop on the tube for Sentosa and Universal Studios etc (which we also visited). Lots of great little places to eat and an interesting and authentic place to stay surrounded by daily life of Chinese people in Chinatown which made a nice change from being surrounded by shops in Orchard Road or the glitz of Marina Square. Small place so you get really personal and attentive service and we were particularly impressed with the staff here which were on names terms by end of first day.

Booked on the basis of price, Tripadvisor reviews and the interesting looking design of the building. We arrived at 9.40pm, after 11 hours travelling, and were shown to Rm 207, a very large, classy looking room with the end wall entirely of glass. There was a very noisy dehumidifier running and basically the room smelled very damp and unpleasant. There were gaps between the blinds so privacy, most notably in the bathroom, was not assured. Long story short, we changed room but only after being told we might have to return to the original one the next night, also and the new room was smaller because we'd had a free upgrade. No-one had mentioned the upgrade that just got me more wound up. The new, smaller room, 406 was basically fine, and again had a glass end wall. Two foibles - about 3 seconds after the basin starts draining, the sound of water pouring down a very deep well and hitting the surface came out of the shower drain behind us. We also had to keep the bathroom blinds down at all times for privacy from the balcony below. We tried to get some food downstairs just before closing time. They were effectively shut & staff told us the menu was the same as room service, so that's what we did. We later discovered it would have been 15% cheaper to eat downstairs. When the food arrived - mushroom & truffle pasta \u2013 it was fine. The daily newspaper and some soft drinks in the fridge were complimentary, the beers expensive. Buy some at a local shop. Breakfast options were limited, but adequate. The following morning Reception confirmed that we could stay in 406 and after that everything went ok. I got the impression that everyone was trying to be especially accommodating to me in all subsequent contacts. But it was all too late in my book. Perhaps the guy behind reception when we arrived was just having a bad day.

I had known in advance due to my telephone conversation with a staff that parking was tight and was on a first come first serve basis. However, upon driving my car down, I was surprised to find that while the car park was not full, 3 lots had been blocked, effectively leaving me somewhat stranded. This was contrary to what was conveyed to me over the phone. Nonetheless, a staff thankfully allowed me to park at the side. Upon check-in, we politely voiced our displeasure but all we got was some apologies. At that point, I already had second thoughts about staying. Thankfully, the rest of the stay was more pleasant than the check in we experienced. The room was nice and spacious, equipped with a rain shower but a voyeuristic view, not from the inside but from the outside. It was a pity to drop the blinds 'cos the view overlooking Link Hotel was quite pleasant. The facilities provided were very much to our liking, with complimentary drinks and movie rentals, something lacking in other hotels. The amenities included free Wi-Fi and Molton Brown toiletries. Thumbs up here. The location isn't very good for those who want lots of activity. It is smack in the middle of Outram Park. The MRT is about 10 minutes walk away and so is Tiong Bahru market. Apart from that, access to civilization requires a 5 minute drive to Clarke Quay. The hotel facilities were somewhat constrained by the building's original design. As such, there was neither space for a swimming pool nor much room for parking. I don't think there was a gym either though admittedly, we did not check. The furnishing is very new and modern. All in all, the whole experience fits the image of a boutique hotel. Service-wise, the hotel staff was friendly and obliging, They were thoughtful enough to provide a birthday cake 'cos they knew it was my wife's birthday. Many thanks for that gesture.

What started out as a research for a nice weekend getaway got a little difficult as all the other hotels like Link Hotel and Scarlet Hotel Singapore didn't quite have very good staff who can handle conversations very well. Let me proliferate my point. I spoke with Mark at about 4 to 5 plus in the morning after getting horrible, impatient and lousy language spoken replies from the other two hotels. He was very knowledgeable on the room amenities, cost price of each room and even down to the room size. He spoke with such patience and explained every detail to me carefully and cheerfully, given the time of the night. The other two hotel receptionists had to put me on hold for the various questions I asked, which were standard questions by the way and each time when they are back in the conversation, they sound impatient and quite eager to end the call. But not with Mark. He even told me which room was more cost effective and which had better view of the city streets. Can you imagine this, a service staff who is more interested in making sure my stay was a happy and worthwhile one and not considering the overall cost price of what I'd be paying? Now, that's what I call excellent service! My decision to finally have my weekend stay with Wangz Hotel was largely due to Mark's professionalism and patience with me. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by Jufri who always had his smile ready for us even throughout the stay. He would constantly ask me if my girlfriend and I enjoyed ourselves and was always interested to know how he can further make our stay a pleasant one. He took time to carefully show us all the rooms that the hotel has to offer and even upgraded us to the Balcony room which in my opinion was an excellent room! The room was spacious, and super chic modern looking. The beds, pillows and blankets were comfy, the TV was huge and was mounted on the wall, lights could all be controlled at the comfort of your bedside. DVD players are by your side where you could get a list of movies from the front desk. The rain shower was an excellent concept that they acquired, giving us guests the feel of tranquility right in the very comfort of our rooms. I love particularly the soft pipe in Jazz music that they have. Back to the service of the staff. I accidentally broke one of the lamp bulbs and the staff were up in double quick time to repair it for us and even cautioned me to watch my steps in case there were very small pieces scattered around. He took time to vacuum every single area around the table and kept apologising that he is taking a long time. I was touched by the fact that even though it was my fault, he could apologise and say that he felt bad for taking a long time to clean up the place. A huge pity I didn't get his name. I left the next day with very high hopes of coming back again because my girlfriend and I enjoyed the place tremendously, highly so because of the excellent and simply perfect customer experience that we had. A month later, I told Jufri that I'd like to book another weekend and I told him it was for my girlfriend's birthday. He went ahead of his jobscope to prepare for us a complimentary cake, asking me which flavour she likes and what her name was. Most places I know would not bother about making sure the flavour of the cake was correct and they would much less bother about the birthday person's name. Jufri was sweet and detailed, making sure that the cake was chocolate and non spongy. He even asked if I'd like wine, sparkling or champagne. This indeed made me feel like a very valued guest to them. The room I got this time was the Soak Room and it was like a palace. Everything was just like the first room, clean and neat when we arrived and Jufri arranged for the room to be decorated for my girlfriend's birthday! Good job! The bathtub was huge and the water pressure of the washroom was good and strong and the fluctuations of the temperature were quick, unlike other hotels' which takes a longer time. Overall, my stay has been very pleasant, and I'd like to reemphasize on the top notch service quality from the staff of Wangz Hotel, obviously attributing it to Mark and Jufri. The face of any industry will always begin with the staff that they have and these two chaps are indeed the pride of Wangz Hotel.

We also liked that we could borrow DVDs for free from the reception. Our only complaint is the noisy gushing sound of water on the ceiling, which came in all hours and kept waking us up in the middle of the night. Some sort of gutter problem? We also found the slamming of heavy doors of other rooms to be rather bothersome, but our episode could have been the exception as our floor had a group of young people running between their rooms. Service was very pleasant, the staff were friendly, helpful and made it a point to address us by name. Breakfast was simple but sufficient.

Overall it was a pleasant experience. Upon check in (which was very fast & fuss free), I was upgraded from the Deluxe Room to the Canopy Room. The room is spacious with ample amenities. The bed is probably the most comfortable one that I've tried and I've been to other boutique hotels in Singapore like Naumi, Quincy, & Capella @ Sentosa. The duvet & bedcover is very soft & the pillows are fluffy and nice. The bathroom is spacious with rainshower & a lighting magnifying mirror for easy application of makeup/skincare. The minibar items that are not free are actually very reasonably priced. In fact, I daresay it is around the kind of price you will get if you go to a Singapore supermarket. For example, the Toblerone (medium size) is about SGD2++, the Snapple is SGD3++. The staff are very courteous & friendly without being over-eager or too 'in your face'. Although the location is not really in the city centre but I kinda like it, there is a Cheers convenience store at the Link Hotel next door, it is near to the excellent Tiong Bahru food centre & literally next to the hotel (at the Outram Rd side), there are a few shophouse eateries incl. the famous Tiong Bahru Bao. The hotel stay comes with these complimentary stuff: -WIFI & wired internet access -non alcoholic beverages from the minibar + coffee/tea -continental breakfast -Molton Brown toiletries Just a few minor complaints: -as there aren't many facilities like swimming pool or sauna/spa, there may not be much to do for locals who stay there for a weekend getaway. Although they do offer DVD selection & Playstation so that's something -I personally would like it if I can connect my laptop to the TV but the TV is kind of bolted to the wall & there are no visible ports to connect to laptop. I asked the staff but there was nothing he can do & he apologized profusely for this, which I thought was very courteous. -the breakfast selection is very limited. My stay included continental breakfast & when I got to the 'restaurant', there was not much pastries to choose from. Not sure if in the first place it was provided as I only saw wholemeal bread types. -I could hear the sounds coming from the opposite room which was pretty close to mine. Seems that the guests invited some friends over & they were having some sort of celebration late at night. I have no issue with that except that the rooms are not as soundproof as I want them to be. The security guard somehow found out about the noise & warned them but I kind of expected that the rooms would be more soundproof. I stayed at other hotels before incl. the types where people like to have celebrations inside their room & I never had this problem Overall it's a nice hotel, would have liked it if they have more facilities & offer more services especially for local getaways but it's not at all a bad hotel.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "WestAussie2010", "ReviewID": "UR70567740", "Content": "Ultra modern rooms.

Of coz you can turn it off or down, but the music they chosen is indeed nice melody and quite good to accompany you to sleep. Location is convenient and people there are helpful. The Halo rooftop bar is certainly a best place to relax after a full day appointments. The large and crispy projection screen makes it the wonderful place to watch world cup.

No bins there :) The hotel is a walking distance to Outram MRT, takes about 10 minutes to walk there. The breakfast was included but was nothing special, the usual toast, bacon and eggs, yoghurt...

For some who are a little picky about their service, this may be a slight slight issue. I found that every taxi driver I had didn't know the hotel. I suppose that is a sign of how new it is.
