Its proximity to Termini Station [less 50 metres] which is the transport hub for trains, metro and buses - making it very easy to access all the main sites of Rome and to/from the airports. Termini also has the best self-service restaurant with a daily variety of traditional Italian dishes. 2.

Breakfast room was clean and nice looking, but the staff had a bit problems coping with all the guests - one morning there was no bread, no ham and no juice when we arrived, and it took some time before we got something to eat. But staff was very friendly. The hotel is close to Termini, and that was very convenient for us, because the taxi drivers were striking most of the time, so it was impossible to get a taxi. Nice hotel where I would gladly stay again, but in another room without water leaking at the bathroom and the mouldy smell from it!", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cFind someplace else if you can\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5341918", "Content": "Rude and uninterested front desk staff. Strange how the credit card machine broke the morning we had to checkout, meaning a dash to an ATM for cash.

Very clean, nicely decorated small hotel in Rome. Was not able to sample free breakfast since we had an early flight. We did have a short power failure (1-2 minutes, unfortunately while in shower:), but overall, would stay again. Cannot beat for convenenience to station & train to airport. Can also walk to the Forum, Spanish Steps, etc. Enjoyed!", "Date": "April 5, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marghera Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d232879-Reviews-Marghera_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$106 - $211*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Marghera 29</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232879", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e5/ca/32/marghera-hotel.jpg"}}
