Our diverse group covered the ages from 14 to 70 and the Nieuwmarket covered all possible needs from supermarket, market stalls, cafes and a coffee shop right on the corner :) I have been visiting Amsterdam for 35 years and the apartments are the largest accommodations I have ever seen in Amsterdam and larger than most surrounding homes. Most of the apartments have access to a balcony and our one bedroom apartment had two. The other main attraction is the location with lots of atmosphere and plenty to see. If you handle the stairs the penthouse has the best views and is a great space which we put to good use and had a cocktail party for 20 people. The bedroom door is a good laugh and is hung upside down and larger than the door frame. The front rooms overlooking the street and the first floor apartment seemed to be the only ones without access to a balcony. Must mention that whilst the balconies are a great spot to chill they are surrounded by residents who are quick to complain about any noise after 10pm. We were reprimanded 3 times but they did not realise we were from the same group otherwise I think they would have caused more trouble for us. It was around 10:30pm and we were not using foul language just laughing a lot but were threatened with the police. In summary The Monk was a casually managed complex with large well equipped apartments, in a great location and great value. Certainly deserves a higher rating.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExceeded Expectations\u201d", "Author": "MyDadisAJournalist", "ReviewID": "UR119810473", "Content": "Would like to say that this place definitely exceeded our expectations.

The apartments are within walking distance of the station. You walk through (or behind) the Red Light District and through Chinatown right onto Nieuwmarkt Square. The square has a giant castle-looking building called In De Waag which is actually a restaurant. I went for dinner here on my 21st Birthday (in 2009) and it was PERFECT! The entire building was lit by candles and the food was to die for. Highly Recommended. When we went in 2010 we tried to book a table but it was full due to corporate events in the run up to Christmas. We ended up going to a tiny restaurant in the heart of the Red Light District called Blauw aan de Wal ... If you love food then this place is for you. You get a choice of a couple of meals on the menu and they come over and talk you through on your arrival.... It reminded me of these Michelin star restaurants you see on TV. We had fillet of hare which was divine! On arriving at the Monk Apartments you go in to Henks little office/studio and get the keys. You then go though to a separate entrance hall up some very steep stairs to the apartments. We booked the 1 bedroom, but he upgraded us to the 2 bedroom one. It was very spacious and clean (I'm very fussy and I couldn't fault it) with basic furniture. We also had a little balcony which overlooked some of the other apartments patios underneath. One thing I will say is that these apartments, like others in Amsterdam, are very old buildings... One reviewer mentioned mice. At the first apartments we stayed in (in 2009) which were much posher than these (but unfortunately are now private) we saw a couple of mice. The owner came and put some traps down etc. but sometimes you just have to accept there isn't a lot they can do due to the nature of the streets and buildings in Amsterdam. I never saw any at The Monk Apartments though. Our apartment had good facilities including dishwasher, comfy beds (although you get 2 separate duvets) and a very nice range cooker. The location is perfect, I don't know why people are so scared of The Red Light District, it has always felt very safe to me, possibly more safe than the quieter areas. It was minus 10 on our second day and the apartment was still lovely and cosy! I'd recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cWe were not given the apartment we booked and paid for.\u201d", "Author": "christine_edwards", "ReviewID": "UR115889424", "Content": "I would never commend that anyone stay there. Very angry that we did not get the apartment we booked over the Internet i.e City Comfort # 1. We got an inferior apartment with low ceilings at the top of the building. The first day there we cleaned. Fat in the frying pan, stained cups, thick layer of dust under bed, glass coffee table and glass dining table had muck all around the edges. Have to be fair though and say bathroom was clean. Only problem was no blind on large window in bathroom so exposed to those living in building across the lane. After complaining to Henk this was addressed. A towel was stapled to window frame. Also many items not supplied, .such as bedside tables, kitchen utensils, plug that fitted sink, power cord for stereo.

Henk noticed this and offered us the 2 bedroomed apartment upstairs completely free of charge as it had not been booked for the length of our stay. Amazing!! He even came up shortly after with a set of keys for each of us. Less than 10 mins walk from Central Station, the apartments themselves are modern, clean and have all you could ask for. A maid arrived each day and really we just asked her to empty the bins and give fresh towels as this was all we needed. It is in a really fantastic location with the redlight light district within about 50 yards but far enough away so that you wouldn't even know.

We booked and the stay over the internet and booked an apartment sleeping two in a double bed and an apartment sleeping 4 in a double and twin bedroom. We were told we had the Penthouse with a roof terrace (some of our party smoke and smoking in the apartments is not permitted - E500 fine for setting the fire alarms off!) When we arrived check-in was slow but the people in the office were very friendly. We were shown to our apartments but both were in separate buildings as it turned out some other guests had been given the Penthouse. A two-hour wait later they had been asked to move and we were shown to the top of the building. (A note on the first apartment - it was filthy, grot in the fridge, the only access to an outside area was through a bedroom and there is a chinese restaurant opposite that handles a lot of fish - not pleasant with the windows open) The 'Penthouse' was clean enough but I wouldn't recommend walking around with no shoes on! The contents of more than one emptied ashtray were strewn across the rooftop terrace, only half of the lightbulbs worked (don't try and change them - trust me - you'd need gloves to avoid the nasties) and the 'master bedroom' had a door that was too small for the door hole! Hence no privacy AT all. The twin bedroom also connected to the master room which is not ideal. I wouldn't recommend these apartments for people with mobility difficulties or families with children as the steps are very narrow and very steep. There are six or seven flights to the top floor. The building itself is very attractive and the decor in the penthouse is modern but with original features like the wooden floor and exposed beams. There is a fantastic view over the rooftops on the roof terrace and it is a great suntrap during the afternoon / early evening. The problem was that for a self-catering apartment the place just didn't feel clean enough to want to eat in it and for a property billed as 'luxury' we expected a lot more. I did email the apartments to suggest they consider adding doors that fit or have more than only 30% of lightbulbs working but have had no response. With a tiny bit more TLC the apartments could be stunning and might be worth the price we paid, but at the moment they are a little disappointing.
