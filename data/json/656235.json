The room was a little on the smaller side but fine, with a (empty) fridge for your own water/drinks and bottled water was available to charge to your room. There were also wine glasses if you brought your own wine. The breakfast buffet wasn't huge, but was pretty good.

But any one of the young enthusiasts will solve problems for you at no cost. Kat is really helpful. So the fake sheep in the foyer disappeared long ago with the outsize photos in the lifts where one was entertained not by muzak but by the almost subliminal sound of various Euro languages. The rooms have been overhauled but not completely changed so that the linens are still excellent, so too the bed and the pillows. Frigs work now and the bathrooms are even more spic and span than before; they never were luxurious or large! The lighting is even worse now that the hotel has adopted some eco friendly moves such as 'green' light bulbs; bring a head-torch or book light. But the daylight is really beautiful from the great big tall windows (part of which may be opened for a breeze off the sea..). The original designer of the building was responsible for this & each room may depend upon a view of sky, facing West with water views high up, South to include the drama of LAX (the sound of which is blotted out by the double-glazing) East to a lovely park and only the North side low down is not so picturesque. All in all a big improvement now with new services available such as daily breakfast in the foyer at a reasonable price & a dedicated restaurant over the pool area for evenings. One unique feature of the CUSTOM: its proximity to LAX makes it possible to visit LA without hiring a car. The overseas visitor of the future may well be seen catching the municipal buses on Lincoln Boulevarde to visit nearby Venice & Santa Monica.

The rooms, hotel, the staff is totally OK but the hotel is missing a few of the most important accommodations to be able to pass for a good airport hotel. 1. Shuttle service forgot to pick us up. We booked shuttle 3 days prior to the trip (like the homepage said we could). We called, spoke to the front desk and sent en e-mail. When we arrived to LAX there was no shuttle there. Wohoo first time in US.. where to go? We had to call them again for them to pick us up. The explanation was that they had no booking from us. Come on! We are grown ups. Why even offer \"the book before\" service if it doesn't work? 2. No coffee until 7 am. I mean people are jet lagged, they need coffee whenever during the day/night. Airport hotel means guests form all over the world. A coffee machine in the lobby could save lives. Luckily there was a coffee shop and food store where one can get coffee 5.30 during weekdays. I've had few other guests expressing the same issue and asking me where they could get coffee. 3. The smoking area outside of the hotel is horrible. The hotel is a non smoking facility but guests arrive from all over the world. They do smoke. Give them some space where they could take their coffee and cigarette (outside the hotel of course). A place to sit and a table? Even other co-smokers thought it was a joke. But all and all if you're a non smoking, non coffee drinking person who doesn't mind being stood up by booked shuttle service after a 17 hrs flight be my guest.. or the guest of Custom hotel.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno", "Title": "\u201cGreat retro feeling hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Stephen J", "ReviewID": "UR124047903", "Content": ".The custom hotel has been updated with a retro feel.

If you have a lot of bags and are leaving in a hurry in the morning, plan ahead for extra time to wait for an empty elevator. We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport and seemed to be one of the few airport hotels that did not have a bed bug report in the bed bug registry. We checked out bug bite free. If you arrive late and plan to get a shuttle, expect to wait for at least half an hour. Your companion may wonder like mine did, why we didn't book the Raddisson, Hyatt or any of the other major hotels since we saw at least four cycles of shuttles from these hotels come and go as we continued to wait for the Custom shuttle.

Your perception of the Custom will depend on your needs and expectations. Do not stay here if you want cookie-cutter sameness or generic wall art or a bed you have to climb up into. This is an older hotel that has been recently remodeled with a hip new style. The age of the hotel still shows through at times, including the musty smell, and the hip decor won't appeal to everyone - like the stark walls and low bed. All that said, I enjoyed my stay very much. All of the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make me feel welcome, from the complimentary airport pickup, to the very helpful Gerald at reception and Tomas at checkout. The public areas are great - an open lobby was a cool gathering place and the site of a very good buffet breakfast for under $10. I wasn't able to enjoy the bar, restaurant or pool, but they looked to be nice spots to enjoy with friends. There was a mixed crowd of guests, with many apparently visiting from Europe. The room was simple, but clean and with many amenities. Wifi was available throughout the hotel, and its being complimentary put this place a notch above standard airport hotels that charge in excess of $10/day. The bath products were by Lather, and the bed linens were very comfortable. There was a dock for iPods and unique LED lighting that functioned nicely for mod moodlighting as well as a night light. The desk mat explained how to use all the room features, and provided interesting information about its past (it was designed by Weldon Becket, same guy who designed Hollywood's iconic Capitol Records tower, and I might add a host of other recognizable buildings, including the Cinerama Dome at the Arclight and Disney's Contemporary Resort A-frame) What I'll remember about my stay at the Custom versus my many stays at more nondescript airport hotels is that this place actually celebrates its next door neighbor, LAX. The LED lights evoke the color-changing pillars at the airport entrance, and the double-paned windows allowed me to enjoy watching the flights arrive and depart, without the annoyance of their noise. I slept very well. Almost every floor has a common area in the center core, from the \"Duty Free\" vending area to the game room to the art gallery. My favorites were on the \"elevated\" level - one resembles an airport lounge, complete with screens showing arrival/departure info and a computer you can use for printing boarding passes. The surprise treat was discovering the Stratosphere lounge on floor 12 - this peaceful cloud-themed lounge boast two massage chairs. My 20 minutes relaxing in one was absolutely incredible. It's hard to strike a balance between value and luxury, but if the Custom continues to deliver comfortable accommodations with a wide set of amenities at a decent price, I'll be back.

That alone wouldn't have sufficed, but for the staff's obvious investment and pride in the hotel. Like good restaurants, after the initial verve, staying power is tied to sincere pride in one's business, and each person with whom I was in contact was proud of this place. First, it has been professionally and creatively \"refreshed\" (as they say) style-wise, and I enjoyed the retro '60's touches. I enjoyed my stay in part because everything felt thought-through and style-conscious. Where I am not style-conscious, I can appreciate its value. Second, it was a place one would seek to eat and to relax independent of whether one were staying there. The restaurant was well-styled and the food great. The selection was relatively small, but notwithstanding, only an overly-finicky person wouldn't have found something interesting to eat. The pool-side deck and evening bar were hip and able to accommodate the array of potential guests. I appreciate the sincerity of the wait staff (I elected to eat all my meals at the hotel, in large part due to a positive breakfast experience on the first day). Last, I enjoyed the new and creative way by which they oriented me to the hotel's amenities (e.g., an ink-blotter on the desk/end table conceived as an airline emergency procedures trifold). The staff was very accommodating, and with their efforts was able to conduct some business, but I think a more robust and accessible business room or similar room (e.g., with printing, scanning, faxing) would be helpful to attract more business folks. Likewise, the electrical system is not prepared for the 21st century's need for several plugs to charge/use several devices. My last (minor) critique is that the interactive TV isn't terribly interactive, and I gave up after a while, as it became too difficult to simply watch a baseball game.

The hallways (walls, floor, ceiling) were painted this muted grey color, and it had this David Lynch feel to it while walking to our room. Once inside, we were greeted with full wall length white curtains and minimalist retro decor. I guess our room had a dog theme, since the pillows, throw, and carpet had these tiny embroidered M.C.

The hotel was a great value 3 star property however I thought it could have been a little cleaner - the amenities in my bathroom had been used and the packaging was dirty, it was a little dusty and the fridge door would not close. Saying that, my overall impresion was of a great value property within a few minutes of LAX and a minute's walk from the Big Blue Bus stop which goes to Santa Monica in about 30 minutes for $1. Excellent!! I phoned the hotel after clearing customs and waited about 15 minutes for the car to arrive. It was driven by one of the friendly hotel staff, was clean and comfortable. My key was ready for me at the hotel on arrival and I was greated warmly, advised that the bar and restaurant were open until 10pm and the log in details for the free wifi and shown to my room. The room was compact but the bed was very comfortable (despite being a bit soft) and there was an iHome sound dock. I looked out over the airport, which was a bit of a boring view, but the rooms were well soundproofed and I didn't hear a single plane (or car) all night. The bathroom was also small but the shower had decent water pressure and the amenities (shower gel, shampoo etc) were quite lovely. After settling in I went in search of the restaurant. There was no information pack in my room or in the lift so it was impossible to know where the gym/restaurant/bar etc was unless you went to reception to enquire. Once I did that the bar was easy to find. To the right of the lobby there is a large outdoor pool area with cabanas, a fire pit and plenty of sun loungers. The restaurant and bar overlook the pool from a mezzanine level. I sat in the bar on a comfortable sofa next to a heat lamp - it was cool in the evening - with my book and waited about 10 minutes for the bar man to come over and offer me both the bar and restaurant menu. I ordered what turned out to be one of the best margaritas I have ever had (the Custom Margarita with orange and chipotle - delicious) as well as the Yellowtail Crudo which was a sashimi style dish with avocado and ponzu sauce. The quality was superb and far exceeded my expectations from an \"airport\" hotel. I also ate breakfast in the restaurant the next morning. It was a beautiful sun trap and the food and coffee were again of wonderful quality, particularly for the price which I thought was very reasonable. Overall I thought this was a great place to stay. As long as you remember that it is a 3 star, not a 5 star, then you should be pleasantly surprised. I found the service to be excellent (except for one of the bell boys who I thought could let the team down), the location was good, and the bar and restaurant better than I could have hoped for. The pool area is a nice touch, particularly for those hot LA days. As previously mentioned I couldn't find the gym and didn't see any of the other lounges as there was no directory advising where they were. I would have liked to be able to check them out.

After checking in, I was given a key to my room which didn't work, so I went back to the front desk and informed the bearded guy that my key didn't work. He rolled his eyes and gave me another key.

I'm just glad to have a shuttle, but its a mess, takes a while to get there and they don't have a van with the name of the hotel on it, which makes you feel kinda like you gotta keep your eyes peeled.

Whenever I stay near airports, I don't expect to be in the cultural center with art museums and cafes in walking distance. But there is a great sushi place around the corner. I like the design though, its minimalist, and functional. The rooms: They are fine, they are a little weird / super trendy, but mine was clean and fine. I found that the comments related to dogs / cleanliness were the most concerning, but my room was completely clean.

After waiting and getting sunburned for over 2 and half hours we finally found the small unmarked mini van with driver still in it making no attempt to call our names out. On arrival to the hotel the receptionist Maile was very apologetic and provided a compensation credit to our room which we were thankful for, she also put us in a room that did not have an airport view. Apparently the 'new' shuttles have not yet received new permits so they cannot pull in where all the other shuttles do. Secondly, there was an issue with using the pool area, it was very disappointing on not only one but two of our days out of our 4 day stay there that we could not use the pool area due to it being let out to an external business and a group for a pool party. This was really disppointing as the nearest beach in Santa Monica was 40 minutes way by bus.

Maybe it is like landing lights and they have a 60's flying them going on. No big bulky furniture. Honestly when was the last time you stayed somewhere overnight and unpacked? The bed was firm but comfy. I stayed on the 11 floor, it had a TV/computer lounge, very retro. The rooms also have a small window that opens for fresh air. Much better than AC for me (they do have AC). They do offer shuttle service from 5am-2am, everyday. When I was picked up at LAX, I was offered water and a snack, same thing the next morning. Not sure about long term parking. There is a nice restaurant on site, with a lounge and a nice pool area with a fire pit. There is a grocery store, bowling alley, and a small shopping mall, next door.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBoutique airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "Leesw8", "ReviewID": "UR115466983", "Content": "I had stayed at this hotel once before - and before it was the Custom Hotel.

JDV is pretty reputable and rarely disappoints, but unfortunately Custom Hotel, at the time of my stay, was DEFINITELY not up to JDV standard. I'll start with the good: the location, very near LAX, was convenient, and being right next door to a grocery store was nice. A coffee shop is right down the street, and there are a few restaurants within walking distance as well. The staff is very kind, and they will send a courtesy car to pick you up from the airport or rental car stations. Valet parking is mandatory and expensive, but this is true for almost all LA hotels. The lobby looks nice, and although I didn't spend much time at the lobby bar it appeared to be functional and I saw other patrons there. That's where the good ends, sadly. The rooms are far less \"boutiquey\" and far more \"hostel\". The carpet in room is a blueish indoor/outdoor blend, which is not at all nice to look at or to feel on bare feet. There is a very small desk bolted to the wall with only an ottoman to sit on...not terribly comfortable or relaxing. No closet, just a wooden bar attached to the wall. The bed is very low to the ground and doesn't appear modern as much as \"mattress on the floor\". There is a flat screen TV, but it is bolted to the concrete wall opposite the bed that is draped in chiffon. The bathroom seemed fine to me - there is a bathtub/shower combo and the sink was large and everything functioned just fine. The WiFi is free, but good luck getting a signal - apparently the signal boosters have not been put to use and since the hotel is a bit of a metal box, the signal is VERY weak. Same goes for your cell phone while in room. I definitely realize that we could all use a break from technology overhaul, but while on a business trip, I need reliable internet and cell use, and it was very frustrating to struggle with this at Custom. The hotel is pet-friendly, which I love - would have loved to bring my dogs if I was not on a business trip - but I found a tick in my room. I understand that animals have fleas and ticks from time to time, but if you are going to be a pet-friendly hotel, you MUST make sure that your cleaning staff goes above and beyond to remove parasites for unsuspecting (and pet-free) guests. The workout room is a complete joke - I can only hope that it has not yet been addressed in the renovation. There are a few cardio machines, none of which work well, and the \"personal TVs\", if they work at all, only get 3 channels. Most did not function or even turn on. There are some cool and \"hipster\" elements to this hotel - a vending machine with all sorts of random items for sale (radish seeds, fishnet hose) and a strobe light in each room...but in Custom Hotel's attempt to be \"cool\" they are forgetting about basic comforts. My advice is to wait until the renovation is complete, look for some good reviews, and THEN maybe give this property a try. Until then, it is not even remotely luxury or boutique. It's just kind of gross.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cDifferent\u201d", "Author": "flynomore", "ReviewID": "UR114543453", "Content": "I booked this hotel because I needed a quick layover place near LAX and the hotel provided free shuttle service.

The overhead light in my room was not working and front desk promptly sent someone to look at it. Apparently, maintenance person couldn't do anything about it. I was moved to another room.

I was actually looking for Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn. These hotels come under 2.5 star category. They are the ones that come with free parking and breakfast. Having breakfast and parking at the hotel saves your time and makes your stay comfortable. To my surprise, custom hotel also came under the category of 2.5 stars. I think custom hotel would satisfy the minimum requirements of a 2.5 star hotel. Following are the negative things I noticed:- * Valet parking - $20 / night + tax. No matter how good your deal is, a parking fee of $22 is way too much. For this reason, I had to park my rental car in a parking garage and reach the hotel with the shuttle (parking lot to airport and airport to hotel) * Hi speed internet - you either get 384 kbps internet for free or pay $9.95 / night for hi speed internet * Room style/color - the whole hotel is painted black and gray. Gives you an impression that you are in a prison. There were broken pieces in the wall. * Shuttle - Be prepared to wait in the airport for atleast 20 mins from the time you make a call to the hotel. * Breakfast - Not many items to pick from but priced high. A subway or McD on the way is advisable * Drinking water inside the room - be ready to pay $4.5 / bottle for Fiji Water. There is an alternate option bottles provided by custom hotel is $3/bottle. We took our own bottles Positive things:- * Bed - Comfortable * the rates are lower for 1 queen bed than 1 king bed. Most hotels come up with either 2 queen beds or 1 king bed but custom hotel does come up with 1 queen bed. This could be a pro or con depending on the number of guests in the room. Overall thought - I would have spent 2 hours in the night daily moving between the airport parking lot and hotel with all shuttles. I feel vacations should be relaxed and comfortable. In my opinion, the hotel is not very comfortable. The hotel simply charges its guests for various \"Incidentals\" in every possible manner. Tip/suggestion - if you are doing a priceline bid for a 2.5 star hotel (expecting a hampton inn or a similar kind), make sure custom hotel is not listed as 2.5 star. The best bet is go for 3 star.

Valet parking is mandatory, which I didn't like but was too tired to go out hunting for a parking meter late at night. The desk clerk was having a telephone conversation that lasted about ten minutes before she condescendingly checked us in. The \"bell hop\" who took our luggage upstairs also seemed to be the janitor. The halls are dark gray and foreboding. \"Twilight Zone\" best describes the hallway experience.

Said ice machine on the 9th floor didn't work, so I picked up a courtesy phone and was instructed to check the ice machine on the 8th floor. Finally, I got some ice. When I got back to the room, my wife told me that there was no heat in the room - and it was about 45 degrees F outside. The desk clerk sent up a space heater, but we couldn't get the room much above 60 degrees F until we stuffed a vent in the bathroom with tissue paper so the cold draft would stop filling our room with arctic air. The bathroom once had a heat lamp in the ceiling, but it had been replaced with a back-yard flood light that had been carelessly painted red. There was no coffee in the room, but expensive bottled water was available for purchase on top of an in-room refrigerator. The hotel does have a very dark and dreary restaurant that is very, very expensive. The appearance of the restaurant reminded me of a loading dock in the back of a big box department store. We did not eat there. In the morning, I called valet parking and asked them to bring my car to the front desk area. The front desk clerk was talking on the phone and never said a word to us, so I tossed our room keys on the desk and left. We waited about 15 minutes for the car before I decided to go outside and investigate. I spotted our car a short distance up the alley, but there were no keys in it. I finally got the desk clerk to get off the phone long enough to point me in the direction of the valet office at the other end of the alley. A valet got my keys but wouldn't give them to me. He obviously was seeking a tip because he asked if I had any luggage to load and if I was going to go out and come back in. I told him I would never return and demanded my keys. We drove off feeling that we had just escaped from a concentration camp. My room reservation was for $85 - but added taxes and fees (including $22 for parking my car in the alley) brought my final cost to $149. We could have stayed at a nicer hotel for a lot less money.

Two days later my grandmother died. We had to cancel our rooms at the hotel in order to be with family; her death was completely unexpected. I had my husband call to cancel our rooms and get a refund. However, to add insult to injury, the staff was very unsympathetic and said that they would not refund one penny. We canceled our rooms four days before our actual arrival date (typical refund policy requires you to cancel 3days-24hrs before the arrival date in order to get your refund). I couldn't believe that two days after I made the reservation and four days before my arrival date, the hotel would not even give me a partial refund. When I tried to explain why we had to cancel, the hotel wanted to see a death certificate and then \"they would think about it\". I will never stay at this hotel and I will never book through HOTELS.COM again.

Better prices and facilities at any major chain in the LAX area. Apparently they got a bargain for military surplus battleship grey paint so that combined with the dim lighting the hallways have the charm of a tomb. They also apparently got a bargain by buying liquidated clothing racks when Montgomery Ward went out of business, putting them into the rooms instead of closets. No coffee pots in the rooms, so when we asked for one we were told there are none, not allowed in the rooms. Fire hazard? Then how explain the steam iron and hair dryer?

First off let me say that I am 26 years old so I get the whole young hip cool boutique hotel thing. I travel to LA quite a bit and I have stayed at many different hotels in the LAX area. This is my least favorite hotel. There is no closet in the rooms, only a rack to hang your clothes IF you are lucky to have hangers, mine did not. There are vending machines only on the 6th floor and the time that I went there they did not have sodas or snacks available only two vending machines selling weird toys. The hallways are painted a depressing dark gray with matching carpet for an extra gloomy dungeon feel. The bathroom was very small and my shower curtain had mold, and on top of that the shower head was not properly working. The bathroom door does not shut, only slides so not much privacy there anyone can just walk on in. The valet parking seems totally unnecessary as the valet parks your car in a lot that is literally 50 feet away from the entrance of the hotel. It should be self parking and it should be free. There is one thing I liked about this hotel and that is the wireless internet is free. Oh and also the price was ridiculously cheap. I just keep reminding myself of that as I am standing in my tiny shower with low water pressure and walking all the way to Ralphs just to get a soda.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cVery nice and clean but not the right choice for someone who plans to spend time at the hotel\u201d", "Author": "PSU93Girl", "ReviewID": "UR83176292", "Content": "I spent 5 nights at the Custom Hotel in Los Angeles, CA and I found it to be a very nice, clean hotel with helpful staff. But it is definitely not the hotel for you if you plan to spend a lot of time in your room or if you have a family. The pool is TINY (I saw a woman swimming \"laps\" and it took her 8 strokes to get across the pool, 9 if she went diagonally from corner to corner. The pool is more of a place to hang out and be seen than a place to take a dip and cool down. The room was nice, though I found the placement of the bed smack in the center of the room to be a bit odd. And I had never been in a hotel without a dresser in the room before. There was a free safe, which was nice, and it was big enough to hold my netbook computer, iPod, jewelry, and BlackBerry with plenty of room to spare. The bathroom was very sparse but again, if you're using the hotel room as I did--a place to sleep and keep my belongings while I spent time out and about with friends--it was perfectly adequate. Valet parking was $22 per day and they took good care of my rental car. There is no self-park option, which was a bit disappointing, but the valet service was prompt and never delayed me from getting to where I needed to be. There is a grocery store right next door and if you tell them you are staying in the hotel they will give you one of their discount club cards to use during your stay. There are several coffee shops and restaurants in easy walking distance as well as a Bank of America. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel--and the reason I wouldn't recommend it for families--is that there is a poolside bar that gets VERY loud and stays open very late at night. The first night I was there was a Wednesday night in the summer and the only thing that allowed me to sleep (I had one window that faced the pool) was that I was jetlagged from my flight. I was on the 3rd floor so I would recommend paying the extra money for a room on a higher floor to avoid having to hear the pool bar noise all night long.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLiked it Cheap too\u201d", "Author": "boogiebook", "ReviewID": "UR82951597", "Content": "Near the airport ...
