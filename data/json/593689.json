I chose it because of its belonging to the Accor group, which I find quite dependable and good value for money. From the airport we took the Connexion shuttle, which for some strange reason, cannot pick you up at the same hotel on your departure. They can drop you off but can't pick you up. Even the driver didn't know why. Anyway, about the hotel. Our first night was spent in one of the tiniest rooms I have ever seen on the ground floor. There wasn't even room to put our suitcase on the floor. This wasn't a last minute checkin either, having booked months ahead. Other rooms were available but the man at the desk deemed it logical to put us in the smallest room in the hotel. The next morning, chatting to the girl at reception, who was very friendly, we mentioned where we were. She was shocked to find out we were in that cubbyhole and immediately moved us to decent quarters. This new room was perfect and totally adequate for our needs. There was no noise from the street below. In the room there is an appliance for heating water and plenty of tea and instant coffee envelopes. The television was plasma and on the wall facing the bed. Breakfast, included in the rate, was excellent with plenty of variety. There were several types of croissant, cold cereals including muesli, yogurts, a variety of jams, even eggs and bacon. The best part was the coffee machine, which produced a delicious capuccino. The women working at breakfast seemed to be Filipino or Malasian and were always very outgoing and friendly, greeting everyone and asking if we wanted anything else. All in all, I would say that the hotel staff was well trained to satisfy the customer's needs. As far as location goes, the hotel is in a quiet area, closer to the Museum Quarter than the central train station, but only a few minutes walk to the tram stop. The Van Gogh Museum is 1.5 kilometers away and walking slowly (12 minutes a kilometer) it would take you 18 minutes. A Lidl supermarket is a few meters away to the east on Stadhouderskade and on the large avenue to the west, the Van Wouststraat, there are seemingly non-stop ethnic restaurants, mainly of an Oriental persuasion. There is a cash machine in front of the Roots restaurant, at Stadhouderskade 123. Sadly I did not encounter any bedbugs or perhaps they didn't find my blood enticing. In conclusion, considering that lodging is very expensive in Amsterdam, I would definitely recommend the All Seasons.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cBed bugs nightmare\u201d", "Author": "roger d", "ReviewID": "UR126706363", "Content": "I booked this room in march 2012, sadly I did not read trip advisor prior reviews, trusting that as the hotel is part of the ACCOR group (sofitel and co), this hotel would be clean.

The All Seasons is still is in a nice location, just across from a canal - my room had a balcony overlooking the canal. A great restaurant called the Roots is just on the corner, and there are plenty of fast food places and convenience stores within walking distance. The downsides were: small room (seems to be the case everywhere in Amsterdam), very basic bathroom w/ small shower (no bath), strange/old hairdryer that doesn't really work + poor lighting in the bedroom.

The room was small... too small and didn't smell very nice upon entering. We had a balcony which was nice but it overlooked a main road which was quite noisy. The breakfast was ordinary and if it wasn't included in the price you wouldn't bother. They didn't even have a toaster, you had to use a jaffel maker to toast your bread. On our thrid morning the hot food ran out before the breakfast was due to end or they just took it away. Ordinarily we would have said something but we figured they were doing us a favour. The worst think was the location... too far out for walking unless you like walking a lot. This was more our fault for relying on other peoples reviews.

The first great thing I would say is that we expected to be getting trams everywhere but in fact we never got a single one! If you are a speedy walker like me and my boyf you will find you can walk pretty much everywhere in Amsterdam. If you like to stroll you'll probably be better on a tram, although Rembrandt Plein is really close for great food and drink (The Old Bell). The Hotel has a big staff team and they are all very welcoming and speak good English. We arrived from the airport at about 10am and although check-in isn't until 2pm the guy on reception let us have our room straight away. Also note you have to pay city tax on arrival (ours was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9 for 4 nights). Our room was on the 4th floor, right next to the lift (slowest lift in the world but makes hilarious noises) which is a welcome alternative to the steep wooden stairs - although we never really had any problems with noise in the room. Room 406 was quite small but perfect for our 4 night stay, with twin beds pushed together, a safe, tea and coffee making facilities, shower, plenty of storage and 3 mirrors! The only downside was that the hairdryer in the room was strange looking and difficult to use, I've added a picture 'cos I don't think my descriptions will do it justice - I recommend taking your own if you need to use it every day. Daily room service is a nice bonus, making the beds and leaving fresh towels, but unfortunately never cleaning the teacups and spoons. Breakfast is GREAT, as a girl who likes their food I was not disappointed. Tuck in! YUM! Another thing, we got a return train ticket but we did notice that the hotel does a shuttle to the airport for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 which is VERY good. Finally, we found a quite sizeable supermarket 5 mins away, across the bridge L out of hotel and under the right of the AEGON building sign :) they sell a 6 pack of Heineken for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.60!! and snacks of course.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat!

Breakfast was 7.5 euros each. We found better breakfasts for slightly less at a local cafe as it happened. We subsiuently complained to booking.com and got a 25 euro rebate for 2 days. This may not be the hotels fault - never got to the bottom of it. The stairs, in common I would imagine with most Amsterdam economy hotels, are very steep. There is however a lift. The rooms were basic yet comfortable. Tea coffee ( one sachet each per day mind) facillities in the room. We had a room at the back of the hotel which may have been smaller than those at the front. Good quality wall mounted TV had lots of international channels including BBC1 and worked very well. The bathroom was very small but the bath very large, deep and the plumbing worked very very well.

However there were tickets for larger periods of time - at a consumate larger cost. We asked the receptionist if they could check our flight status ( there was huge disruption due to snow) and after a token effort they declared they could not get on the Schippol website. It could well be that the password printer was problematic but even then the wifi / internet access was pricey. The receptionist on duty when we arrived was v friendly, however we never saw her again and there was a constant change of staff - some cheerfull and some less so. All had v good English. The most contentious aspect of the hotel was that we are reasonably sure we had a bedbug in the sheets. We had no idea what bedbugs look like but on returning home googled them and are reasonably sure the little blighter we saw was a bed bug. Bit like a small apple seed, which moves about a bit.

The hotel has about 45 rooms, and my collegues and I got the three rooms on the ground floor, directly facing the lobby. which means, everybody passes by, taking the wooden stairs or the elevator - not to mention the breakfast room which is also just besides the lobby. The room had a big window with a sliding door, which could be opened completely or shut, but nothing in between - quite advanturous during the night if you want to sleep with an open window, because the room once was the entry hall of the side building (both buildings were put togehter for the hotel), so it had stairs down to the road just outside the window: an open invitation during the night?!

Another friend was in an \"authentic\" Amsterdam room, with a sloped ceiling so that in the shower she had to bend at the waist to get her head under the water (she's only about 5'5\").

Were very impressed that our room was ready for check-in at 10am rather than the 2pm specified. After a very early flight from London this was appreciated. The room was clean and tidy but quite small. Amenities include an in-room safe, tea and coffee making facilities and an en-suit bathroom, but no in-room fridge. There is a vending machine in the foyer, and an internet terminal you can use with a pre-purchased card, but no room service or mini-bar facilities. If you require a supermarket, there is one about 100m away from the hotel. When you exit the hotel turn left, cross over the intersection and the supermarket is further along on the left hand side. The rooms themselves are quite small. Neither I nor my partner are tall people however both of us had to duck to use the bathroom, particularly the shower. Be careful also as the shower curtain is highly inadequate and the shower can easily flood the bathroom. The included breakfast was adequate and included cereals, breads, cold meats and cheese. The service from the hotel was fine, but nothing really special. Location wise the hotel is great. Walking distance from the museums, Heineken Experience and botanical gardens. Two trams run past the hotel and can take you to Dam Square and Central Station in 10 mins. From either of these places you can change trams to go to the Anne Frank House or simply walk from Dam Square in about 7 mins. TIP: Take the number 4 or 25 from Central Station to the Hotel, getting off the stop after Fredreiksplein. TIP: Amsterdam is expensive. Trams are Euro 1.60 per trip, or you can buy a 7 trip card for Euro 4.50. Even better if you think you will catch them a lot is the 24 hour card for Euro 6.50. Multi trip cards can not be bought from the tram driver, only ticket sellers such as the Tourist Information Centre outside Central Station. Recommend you get one before you head off to your hotel. Overall the hotel was fine. Nothing special but nothing worth complaining about. The location is not great for restaurants or a quick dinner but with the trams so convenient you can always jump into town and grab something.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced for what you get\u201d", "Author": "grantos3000", "ReviewID": "UR6821823", "Content": "I booked this hotel for my first trip to Amsterdam in December 2006.

Upon arrival at the hotel at 11 am, we were told to leave our bags until 2, which was fine -- off we went to the nearby Van Gogh museum. Upon returning at 2, we were told that they were overbooked and we were being transferred to their sister hotel in the red light district -- not at all where I wanted to stay, and it was a one star! After much debate, we were told that we could look at their other property, the Hotel Linda next door. No jokes, there were bloodstains on the wall above the bed and bugs crawling all over the mattress. We returned and told the manager that there was no way we could accept either of these transfers. I must say, he was very helpful, letting us use the phone and store our luggage as we worked out alternate stay arrangements. In addition, I should mention that the internet company promptly refunded our money. The reason why I chose to post this review, despite not having actually stayed at the hotel, was because I was struck by the manager's comment during our discussion.

The hotel changed the reservation without penalty (with more than 24hrs warning.) We had to change rooms twice because of the poor quality of the rooms. When we arrived at 9 am with check-in time being 2pm, it took some effort to be allowed to leave our luggage until check-in time. The desk clerk flatly advised us to come back not earlier than 2pm. Our documents folder, which we left for 5 minutes on the front desk barrier, with copies of our passports and itineraries, was found by us in the hands of strangers in the lobby. The strangers were eagerly reading our papers. The twin room which was assigned to us first, number 405, has little in common with pictures provided on the hotel's Web site: it was small, claustrophobic, with a window, which could not be closed in principle. There was only one bed stand, placed in such a manner, that its drawer could not be opened due to smallness of the room. Next morning we asked for a different room. Our request was granted with the room 107, which was of a decent size. However, its storm window was broken, so that it could not be open reliably. Immediately beneath the window there was the roof of the breakfast area. The roof was covered with garbage. The window did not have a mosquito screen, so when the window was opened (precariously), the room was filled with mosquitos (which were flying inside the hallway as well.) Our sleep was disturbed not only by mosquitoes, but also by a loud TV in the adjacent room, used, obviously, by the night staff. It took tapping on the wall to make them make TV less loud. Next morning we requested yet a different room, and get the room 307 of the same size as the room 107. While waiting at the front desk, we heard departing guests expressing their dissatisfaction with their rooms. The 307's window (storm type) could be opened more reliably, but it did not have a mosquitoe screen - again, so the mosquitoes remained a problem, though less prominent than before. (The hotel does not have A/C, so to open the window is necessary.) The cleaning crew did not bother to dust off the surfaces, and the windowsill was dirty. The bathroom was new and clean, with ventilation working permanently. However, in order to get into the bath tub to get a shower, one has to step over tub wall which is about 25 inch high (64 cm). This might be quite difficult for some people, especially in the bathroom, where a fall might be quite traumatic.

The beds were comfy but really sagged in the middle so when my partner and I slept in the bed later that evening we both ended up rolling towards each other into the centre.
