{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great last hotel We stopped here with a small tour group for the last 3 nights of our trip. It was a nice hotel with friendly staff, clean rooms and a nice bar. The location was excellent for subway, shopping and restaurants (try the Peking duck from the restaurant opposite the hotel!) Had the usual Chinese bed of rock, but just sleep on the duvet and use the spare for the top (a bit of extra cushioning!)", "Date": "Oct 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR632067171", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jankiwi"}, {"Content": "Clean and close to subway The Chongwenmen is an ok tourist hotel with small but clean rooms. Well situated close to shops, restuarants and subway. Nice crisp, clean linen. Bathroom ok but shower leaked all over the floor. Safe in room to store valuables. Self service laundry on 2nd floor with iron. Gym and snooker table. Staff seemed friendly enough.

(2) The rooms were generally clean, and in particular, the sheets were clean and decent quality. The rooms were styled in a basic contemporary manner and appeared to have been upgraded within the last couple years.(3) High-speed internet service was also available at a reasonable hourly rate.Cons: (1) Rooms were TINY. There was barely enough walking space around the beds for one person.(2) Housekeeping service was sub-par. For example, they were extremely stingy about giving us extra towels, and ultimately, they allowed us new extra towels if we exchanged them for our existing towels. It also took 2 phone calls and 35 minutes to get a replacement roll of toilet paper. Finally, one of our traveling mates had a dirty toilet when they checked into their room (which the hotel cleaned, thankfully).(3) Beds were rock hard (you could practically feel the metal coils!) -- definitely not like any type of bed I've experienced in the US or other parts of East Asia, so beware.(4) Our room had a balcony with a solid concrete railing that was about 5 feet high, so we couldn't enjoy the view.(5) Mornings were fairly noisy with outside noise, even for those of us who've lived in Manhattan, so be prepared with ear plugs.(6) Finally, my biggest issue: the bathrooms. Towels were rough  appeared old. Our bathtub leaked, making the entire bathroom floor wet after each shower. And on certain days the water got no hotter than lukewarm.One final note: breakfast had both western (fruits  breads) and ethnic (congee  thousand year old eggs) options. As with the other reviewer, we opted to purchase breakfast at nearby shops after the first morning, as we found the quality to be mediocre at best.", "Date": "Jul 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR666553819", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "kokiri"}, {"Content": "Breakfast at the Chong Wen Men The hotel was centrally located which was terrific as it was next to the subway  within walking distance to many Tourist spots but if feel that the breakfasts left a lot to be desired. What was set out on the tables we have still not been able to work out, and we only went for breakfast once then bought our own from the supermarket. Also when you have a bottle of water that says compliments of the hotel you certainly dont expect to pay for it as we had to on checking out.
