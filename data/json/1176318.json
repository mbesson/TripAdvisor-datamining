The hotel is situated right beside the Sants station - the main train station in Barcelona. Although there isn't much around the area it is easy to use the metro lines as they all run through that station as well as the hop on hop off tour bus (which stops 500 meters away). There is free wifi in the lobby and bar area which is great as their bar area also has a tv and a area for free soda, water and espresso in the afternoon and night. The rooms are very modern and sleek looking. The mini bar is free which was awesome! It has fantas, coke, water and tonic water. The only downside is the washroom set up is a bit odd because there is no separation between the bed and the washroom and shower area. There is only a shower and no bathtub. The shower is a bit tinted but this would be awkward if you were traveling with a friend etc.. You would probably have to leave the room or stare out the window while the other washes up. Other than that I don't have any complaints. The shower is wonderful, with the perfect amount of pressure! The only issue is there is nothing going on around the area at night so you have to commute about 10 minutes to get to tw main drag.

Thanks for that not! Tour bus is a really good idea instead of the Barcelona card as you get a booklet with loads of discounts vouchers which actually work out better than the discounts in the Barcelona Card booklet the advantage of the Barcelona card is you can travel free on the trains and metro but its cheap anyway to travel, also the card is activated once you use it on the metro.

The shower recess is interesting as mentioned by several reviews below and while great for a loving couple, not exactly appropriate for, say, two colleagues sharing a room.

The bar on the lobby also offers free drinks and some munchies, which is great while using the free WiFI internet at the lobby. The neighborhood seem to be in some sort of party mode while I was there. There were concerts and live street bands all over the place. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and joining in the fun but when it came time for bed, I had to use earplugs (which I normally carry when I travel as I'm a light sleeper).

They're ok, just doing their jobs. Don't expect fantastic personalised service.

Entry into the hotel or exit from the elevators were always met with a smile and a sincere \"hola\". The room was very comfortable. There were only a few drawbacks --- the HVAC system. We were there in March when the weather started to get warm. Unfortunately, the HVAC only has two settings for the entire hotel -- Winter/Summer. Therefore, despite the warmer weather, the thermostat could never go below 25 C because it was winter mode. While that would not normally be a problem as we love the fresh air of open windows, the proximity to the local park made this impossible. The noise from the park was so loud, we felt there had to be some acoustic phenomena to explain the high decibel level. As a result, we either got too toasty or too much noise. The other bad feature is the shower stall design.

There are a metro station in the near, and also the Bus Turistic stop is near too! The check-in was fast, breakfast was rich and good, various style of food, also included traditional spanish style food! The bed was large, the free minibar is a great idea.

We had booked well in advance to get the special tariff - 15 per cent off. The booking process was as easy as could be. A week before our arrival we got a welcoming email promising the nice 1.8 by 2 metre bed and the free minibar. Sounded nice. When we arrived the checkin process was fast and so we arrived to see our room which was clean and furnished in a modern style. Black glass dominates the bathroom section. However, while laying ourselves to rest we started to doubt that the bed really was 1.8m wide. In fact, it was just 1.4m which meant that we had been given a single room. Well, we didn't complain because we really just spent the nights there but having had a glimpse at the \"normal\" rooms we were - understandably - a bit jealous. Well, next time I would complain because I find it quite cheeky that people who book the discount rates get lower quality rooms. If this is company policy then I'd rather stay away from AC hotels. The wifi internet access is provided via a prepaid card which can be obtained at the reception. The good thing about it is that you get access for 24 hrs - as in our case - for three days. If you don't access the net you wouldn't get charged. The free minibar is stocked up everyday and provides you with pops and water.

I didn't use it anyway as I was busy preparing this presentation and then went off for sightseeing. Lots of eateries / bars outside hotel , open till late and public transport ( trains/metro) run till 2 am. Food is expensive. I didn't have any alcohol during this trip, so don't know the costs. 1 GBP was 1.07 Euros so watch where you eat/drink. Hotel staff spoke/understood English ( Thank you my dear Lord), and there was one Mr Javier, nice guy very helpful. On request, you will get EU plug adaptors, in case you forgot to pack them. You have return it on checkout or else get billed. We also got discounted city hopper sightseeing tour tickets , from this hotel. We payed 32 euros and saved 8 euros.
