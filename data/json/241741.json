Because it belongs to the Best Western chain of hotels, we believed it would guarantee a certain level of comfort and cleanliness. The hotel is indeed well located, but if you are going to Venice it is worth searching for a better hotel, and perhaps spending a little more to get it. We travelled with our children so we had two rooms. Both were good sized but garishly decorated, and with very little daylight. We were bitten by mosquitoes every night, but the worst part of the hotel was the dreadful smell emanating from the bathrooms. At first we thought it might be a \"Venetian\" odour because of the canals, but it came out of the sewers in the shower and sink. The smell was unbearable and we were given another room. The hotel has the disadvantage of not having a lift operating from the ground floor. The one they have is situated on the first floor, so this is a most inadequate hotel for the physically handicapped or elderly. Once you get to the floor your room is in, you have to make your way through a number of winding corridors where you can easily get lost. Service was alright. I did see most of the guests heaving their cases up to the lift floor, with the hotel employees just leading the way with the room keys in hand. Although they are polite, they are not helpful. Breakfast is inedible. The fruit juices taste of candy diluted in water, the coffee had a greasy film on the surface, the eggs were left to dry out in the heating cabinets, and the dining room was horribly decorated. I seriously do not recommed this hotel.

This trip was the first time my husband and I traveled to Italy and planned it out ourselves, so I was a bit worried about the logistics of finding everything and how things would live up to our expectations.

And isn't almost every hotel in Venice well-located? Staying out of the way of the hungry hordes in the jam-packed breakfast room, squeezing around those same hordes for coffee, for eggs, for what is indeed a nicely varied breakfast but in a cramped, inadequately-sized room was an unpleasant way to begin each day in this magical city in sunny late-September. On the plus side, several of the staff were pleasant enough to compensate for overpriced rooms (we can afford it, but more on that later) and the hardest, most amazingly uncomfortable bed ever slept in anywhere on earth: The quietly helpful Alessandro at the front desk; Luca, whose charming assistance and warm hospitality are no doubt unmatched in the hotel trade; and efficient, smiling Mario, a bellman with a sincere wish to accommodate. The most un-charming and first-time-ever event occurred at checkout when a clerk we'd not seen before refused, loudly and rudely, to honor the rate the hotel had confirmed to us in writing. No kidding. In two languages (we speak Italian). When several times we politely tried to present our confirmation papers, he interrupted and just talked over us, finally saying -- and this is pretty close to verbatim -- \"well there may have been rooms available at that rate when you booked, but now there are not.\" So we gave up and made our escape, paying E340 per night for a room that had been confirmed to us at E240. Is this the Best Western way? It certainly is not the Venetian way and this single bizarre experience, unforgettable as it is, won't keep us away from the sparkle of Venice and the countless well-located and charming hotels that fill her piazzale and calle.

He very kindly took our cases up to 3rd floor, carrying them up physically to 1st floor, twisting through several passages then to 3rd floor by lift. Our room was quite small and narrow, and at the end of a corridor, and we wondered how we would find our way out if a fire broke out and blocked our exit from the back corner of the hotel. Our 3rd story window overlooked one of the minor canals and a narrow footpath, which probably could be reached using knotted bedsheets or jumping into the canal itself in a case of emergency! Breakfast was lovely and very generous with many choices on offer,with soothing classical music playing and overall physically the hotel was very clean, neat and an attractive venue. Most of the staff were friendly apart from one person on reception who was quite abrupt and gruff as previously mentioned by TA critics. However, he helpfully recommended the nearby restaurant over the nearest bridge, and owned by the hotel for dining. The restaurant was very romantic with outdoor or sheltered outside dining with candles etc. and with singing gondoliers passing on the canal beside it. The food offered was reasonable but it all was no different than the usual Italian fare. We had been given a \"10 % discount voucher\" by the hotel which we used, but unfortunately the discount was cancelled out by the extra charge of 6 Euros per person for \" the use of the cutlery\" (as explained by the waiter). I have never heard of these charges before anywhere and we were not forewarned at all about it. Next day we had been kindly given the option of leaving our cases at the hotel until we left at midday which was the hotel's room vacation time. There is a certain nervousness about its staff as I read previously in Trip Advisor, we also were followed out by a staff member and questioned about our activities on our way to some nearby ATMs to withdraw money for our hotel payment. We were reminded that we only had 2 hours until we left! This was despite the fact that our luggage was being minded by the hotel, and we had earlier advised them that we were leaving late morning for our cruise ship. (I am not sure whether this over-vigilance comes from management down, or from the overly zealous staff member!)

The dust on the ancient aircon was disgusting. The shower nozzle didn't work properly & 1/2 way through my shower I had to turn it off until it could drain so as not to overflow...it leaked anyway. The porter/receptionist was like Basil Fawlty...clunking my luggage up the stairs & muttering to himself.

I booked this online and was very happy with the hotel. The staff were great to work with and very welcoming. The breakfast was wonderful and had a wide variety of things to choose from - not just bread and coffee. The location of the hotel was great for us - an easy walk to St. Marks Square and a vaporetto stop about 100 meters away. The room had been recently remodeled (this is an old building but you would never know it inside) and was immaculately clean. The bathroom was modern, the room had the traditional silk on the wall. The room was not huge (typical in Europe where space is at a premium) but the best part was that we could open the window and see and hear the gondoliers below us. We were close to the Grand Canal and had alot of gondola traffic. We loved to hear them sing. When you wanted quiet, the hotel had these amazing windows and shutters that closed and you had no noise, and also no light if you wanted complete quiet. My only issue was that the bed was very hard. I have back issues so that is why I gave it the score I did on Quality of Sleep. It was not due to noise or anything else - I just need a softer bed. The hotel to their credit had me try several rooms to see if any were softer (they were all the same) and they had the maids put some blankets over the mattress to make it softer. They did their best to accomodate me in this matter. One thing that you will love is that you do not have to walk over bridges with luggage to get to the hotel. If you take Vaporetto 1 and get off on Giglio you are a straight 100 meter walk to the hotel on a flat surface. Venice is loaded with bridges, and very crowded so you wil appreciate the location and ease of getting there. We bought the Vaporetto pass and had an easy time getting around since the stop was so close to the hotel.When we got ready to go to the ship, we used the Vaporetto pass to get to where we could take the People Mover to the ship. Water taxi's are pricey and we managed to do this fairly easily with a month's worth of luggage. The People Mover to the port is only 1 Euro and is a good value - you can get luggage carts at the port and from there the check in is easy. Water Taxi's start at about 80 Euro and go up so this was a good savings. I don't know if the hotel had a gym or a spa as I did not bother to check - too much else to see in Venice and since you find yourself walking all day you do not need the treadmill. They do not have a pool as far as I know. I did not eat in their restaurant so I cannot tell you about it. There is a decent market in Venice off the Zattere stop (called something like Billeca) on the vaporetto. Wine was very reasonable there and we got a few bottles for on the ship. They also had a nice deli and good selection of snacks. My husband found some cookies he loved. Try the local wine called Prosecco - kind of like a champagne. You could get a bottle for very little at this market. This is the wine used in a Bellini which is the drink of Venice. If you want fresh fruit I recommend the Rialto Market but you have to get there before noon. They have a huge selection of fresh fruits and vegetables which are good quality. You will love Venice - food is kind of pricey but you will have a great time! It is really an interesting place, and one that you should definitely visit.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWe all thought it was excellant\u201d", "Author": "Flowers095", "ReviewID": "UR115629319", "Content": "My elderly brother and wife came over to stay from Australia and we stayed in Hotel ALA for two nights it was a beautifull hotel very clean and friendly and the staff could not do enough to help us with our cases and information.

We bought our tickets for the Vaporetto and, after leaving the airport, followed signs (left) for the docks. We waited a short bit before boarding the Vaporetto and enjoyed the ride to Venice. We got off at Saint Mark's, and had to ask a few different hotels how to find Hotel Ala. It was a bit of a trek with our luggage to get to Hotel Ala (from Saint Mark's). Instead of this, we could have taken the Vaporetto an extra stop (or two) to S. Maria del Giglio - it is 50 yards from the front door of the hotel; a short two minute walk down a little alley. We did then when we were leaving and it was SO much easier. The hotel itself has a strange layout. We had to walk up a flight of stairs to get onto a floor with an elevator that we then took to our fourth floor room. After checking in, we did have a member of the staff carry our bags up that flight - which was helpful! The room itself was lovely. We had a nice window that opened up into a little alley and allowed us to look out over the rooftops of Venice. Our room had a queen bed and a settee. Both were rather firm. We had a small refrigerator, a small tv, and a decent sized bathroom. The shower even had nice water pressure. The room was cleaned daily and felt like home. One of the best features of our stay was the complimentary breakfast Hotel Ala offers. It had a terrific spread of cheeses, meats, breads, cereals, and fruit. They had a number of awesome spreads as well - nutella, jams, jellies, etc. We were offered tea, coffee, espresso, and cappuccino, as well. The best part was that many of the cereals and fruit were individually packaged and the staff didn't mind if you took one or two for the road. We did this each morning, since I'm not a huge eater when I first wake up. I'd take an apple or some granola to snack on. Lastly, the location of this hotel is perfect. I know that I said it was a trek with luggage from Saint Mark's. Without luggage, it was an easy five-minute walk to the square and all attractions. We adore Venice - be sure to visit the Basilica (I recommend paying the extra 4 euro to go to the upper level; you can see the original horses, can view the square from above, and the view of the church's inside from above is impressive) and Doge's Palace (the audio tour of the palace is WELL WORTH the money!!! and, you get to walk the Bridge of Sighs!). When we checked in, the hotel gave us a coupon for the restaurant Ristorante da Raffaele. We went and had a lovely dinner right alongside one of the smaller canals. The food was good, and the view was very quaint. Overall, I would definitely visit Venice again and would most definitely stay at Hotel Ala.

The location is great, near the canal and San Marco Plazo. There are great restaurants all around. But what makes this place really special is the staff. The last night of my stay, my daughter lost her stuffed animal. It was a teddy bear her boyfriend gave her before he went to college and it meant the world to her. The sentimental value was great so when it was nowhere to be found she went to the front desk and tried to explain to them her concern. Apparently, it must have gotten picked up by housekeeping with the bedding. She showed a picture of the bear from her camera (it's something they do whenever they bring the bear to a new place) and concierge took her information. About a week later, my daughter received an email from the receptionist telling her her bear was found and would be shipped to the United States. The bear arrived around the time we returned home and although a little shrunken from the dryer, her bear was good as new. The hotel staff contacted the laundry facility to make sure the bear was found and then shipped it all the way to us in Chicago free of charge.

We spent the last two days of our trip in Venice and stayed at the Hotel Ala. It is part of the Best Western chain, but like most Best Westerns in Europe (maybe everywhere - I'm not sure), it is independently owned and operated. The location could not be better. If you take the Vaparetto to the Rialto stop, the walk is only a couple of minutes from the dock down a narrow alleyway. If you walk the other direction, you can be to St. Mark's Square in about 10 minutes. Our room was spacious by European standards. They were kind enough to place us in the room adjacent to the in-laws, which was convenient for us. Our room was very pink with white, flowery furnishings. It was very princess-like. My wife loved it for that reason but I wasn't too keen on it. But it's all very tongue-in-cheek in the moment. It was clean and comfortable and didn't affect my ability to use the restroom or sleep, so who cares? Her parents' room was not pink but a light shade of green, so I don't think all the rooms are fit for a princess, so to speak. The elevator going up to the room was brand new, but since my wife hates elevators, we took the stairs. We were on the third floor, but it was not bad to climb. The hotel offered one computer with complimentary Internet access (although they suggested a donation to charity in a little lock box on the desk). They gave me the paper with the login credentials, but I decided to drop in a 2 Euro coin. The computer is situated right next to the area where they serve breakfast. The breakfast was pretty good. It was the only place we stayed in Italy that offered hot food, like scrambled eggs. They also had the typical assortment of pastries, breads, etc. and juices and coffee. The seating area was large and clean. There were two people on staff, but they weren't proactive in offering coffee or anything of the like. It seemed like their job was to keep the area clean and well stocked. We booked a water taxi to the airport for the morning of our departure and it arrived right behind the hotel. It cost 110 Euros and took about 45 minutes. The hotel made all the arrangements for us and I don't think they charged us much more than if we had done it ourselves, so that worked out well. The only issue we had with the hotel was the mosquitos. I'm not sure why I never figured there would be mosquitos in Venice with all that stagnant water, but I guess I just assumed early April would be too early for them. I was WAY wrong. We had our window open because we were hot and the A/C was not yet on for the season. Once we realized mosquitos were coming in, we closed it, but it was obviously too late. Although we never really saw most of them, I woke up the next morning with 25 mosquito bites all over my body. The hotel did provide mosquito repellant wipes in the rooms, but no one ever warned us about this. I docked them a little on sleep quality as a result, but honestly, I think this could happen anywhere in Venice, so don't let that deter you from this hotel. Just make sure you bring insect repellant and Cortisone or Benadryl!", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly positioned\u201d", "Author": "annmargaret31", "ReviewID": "UR103789133", "Content": "A perfectly positioned pleasant hotel providing a substantial and varied tasty breakfast.

Then my favourite bit, the pasteries - what can i say tried different ones each morning , totally spoiled for choice.

On a recent trip to Venice I needed to be in the same hotel as a group of photographers with whom I was attending a workshop at Hotel Ala. The exceptional service began as I arrived by water taxi at the hotel's canal entrance in chilly, rainy, blowing weather. I was quickly escorted inside, and my (way too much with photo gear) luggage was immediately taken to my room. Throughout my 10 day stay, my room was immaculately clean, and every special request I made, including booking my water taxi's and numerous concierge services was addressed courteously, enthusiastically, and promply. I can't say enough about the quality of the hotel's service during my stay. To make a 6:45am plane, I had to leave the hotel at 3am, and in my bleary state, I left a small bag of personal gifts for my family. One phone call, an email to confirm, and the hotel promptly FedExed my gifts to me in the US. The hotel location was excellent for us--close enough, but just far away from San Marco Square and the Rialto for some relative quiet during Carnival. My only recommendation for those who visit during Carnival is to request a room that does not adjoin the street or square sides of the hotel--the party goes on all night and the narrow street and small plaza are like a megaphone that makes earplugs worthless. And if the budget permits, enjoy one of the hotel's largest rooms, especially if you are carrying extra luggage or photographic gear. I know it's kinda girlie for a big guy, but the towel warmer in the bathroom was a nice touch.

I have noticed that over that time, junior people have gradually been promoted to senior posts, and receptionists, breakfast room and bar staff, porters, housekeeping, etc have all become familiar figures to us. All are welcoming, friendly, courteous and professional. The hotel will even supply boots to wear when there is the aqua alta. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms are all individually furnished, many with antiques. It is worth paying the extra for a de luxe room (see hotel website) The position of the hotel could not be better, with an entrance directly onto a small canal, allowing for arrival by water taxi - a wonderful way to arrive in Venice from Marco Polo airport!, or the Giglo vaporetto stop is 30yds from the front entrance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very important if you want to avoid pulling your luggage endlessly through the tiny (safe) streets trying to find your hotel! (See maps) The hotel does not have a restaurant but as there are so many very good ones within walking distance this is not a problem and the reception staff have given us suggestions for restaurants which have become regular favourites over the years, these vary in price and style. Of course the reception staff will make reservations, do ask for their advice. The hotel bar is used by locals as well as other tourists which gives a good atmosphere, and the bar has a great selection of wines and other drinks, and can offer cheeses, salamis etc. There are two suggestions we would make if it is your first visit to Venice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c1. Make your first sight of St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square at about 11 at night; you will have it to yourselves. 2. Save up and take a gondola late at night from the hotel steps.

We arrived via a side canal and were helped off the water taxi into an attractive lobby where we were looked after right away. When the porter let us into our room and opened the shutters onto a canal we went wow! The room was very spacious with attractive antique style furniture. The bathroom was huge compared to what we had become used to, it even had a jetted tub. Our bed was very comfortable. Our friend had an equally attractive room overlooking a small square. The breakfast buffet was excellent. There was a variety of: fresh fruit and juice; meats and cheeses; bread, rolls, cereal and pastries; eggs and tea and coffee. All served in an attractive breakfast room. What else could one look for. Location of course is very important and Hotel Ala is very well situated being only a short 5 minute walk to St. Mark's Square. In the other direction I would say we were not much further to the Academia Bridge. Full marks again! We noticed many travelers hauling their bags around obviously looking for their hotel. Given the interesting design of Venice's streets and canals I suspect that some are still out there. The hotel set up hostess service for us and we were greeted at the train station by a very welcoming young lady. If you were inclined to find your own way this hotel would be fairly easy to find being close to the Giglio stop from Vaporetto #1. We were also pleased with the front desk service. On arrival they mentioned a free trip to Murano. Yes I know the motivation but as the ladies wanted to go there anyway off we went. It was very pleasant and the glass blowing demonstration by the masters was neat. The showroom was stocked with beautiful but expensive glasswork, our guide was informative but soft sell so it all went well. When we finished the boat for the return trip was ready to go and back we went. The front desk also suggested a Vivaldi concert at a nearby church, it was excellent. Go at least a half hour early the church was packed. Surely there must be some negatives. Not really the Hotel Ala was impressive in every way. The only nitpick I would have is with the restaurant they suggested, the Da Rafaelle. It was truly awful, snooty service, poor food and over priced. Hotel Ala is a gem, it would be a mistake for them to send customers to this restaurant under any circumstances. Trust your guidebooks like Fodors and Rick Steves for independent restaurant recommendations. On a final note the hotel has basically free wifi internet service and a very nice lobby bar with a mixture of tourists and locals. The Hotel Ala was without a doubt the best hotel we stayed in.

Water buses are also easily accessable to the airport from either San Marco or San Angelo water bus lines. The room itself was a decent size (for Venice).. It was also clean, although the and the bathroom could do with a makeover, it was perfectly adequate. The big plus for this hotel was the staff -I found them all to be really helpful and friendly... For example, we overslept for breakfast on the first morning, due a very early start the day before - The hotel prompt arranged for cappucino's and croissants brought out to us in the sitting area instead. Little touches like that really helped to enhance our stay. The bar within the hotel is one of the better places to enjoy a evening drink as well. It does cater mainly for Americans, but that is no great surprise seen as it is part of the Best Western franchise, and hence is popular with US tourists. Overall, big thumbs up for hotel location and friendliness of staff.

What makes it so special is not only its location -- it is picturesque Campo Santa Maria del Giglio -- close to the vaporetto stop, the traghetto (a gondola) across the Grand Canal to Dorsoduro and to Saint Mark's, the Fenice Theatre -- and its unique character! -- a wonderful, friendly, caring staff. The concergi (Mareno, Fabbio, Alessandro, the two Stefanos and Luca) and all of the guys know about everything -- and owner/manager, Andrea Salmaso, who is one of the most thoughtful, kindest persons whom we have met in our travels through the years. He and his assistant, Silvia, are true gems! Now for some specifics -- let's start with the buffet breakfast. It is a feast and will keep you going for hours. Katja, Liana, Eleanora (and Alessandro and Farid) keep everything running smoothly! They are just great! When it rains, the hotel staff provides you with an umbrella and when acqua (the high water) alta arrives, a pair of boots. Nothing is overlooked. And their restaurant recommendations are excellent -- the family run, Al Bacareto has become a favorite. Then there is Tarnowska's -- a relaxing lounge with super hosts: Rey and Domenico -- where one can have a prosecco or an espresso, tea (they also serve a caprese salad and toast -- ham and cheese) after a day of sightseeing -- and there is so much to see in Venice. Walk and get lost and find your way back -- yes, there are tons of tourists -- but sometimes you must drift apart and find the serenity and mysterious beauty that only Venice has! Tarnowska's also has on-going art exhibits -- culture is indiginous to the Venetians. One doesn't need health clubs or pools -- just walk over the endless bridges and exercise your mind, body and soul! Our lovely room -- under the care of the lovely Yolanda -- with all the amenities for comfort (tub, shower, safe, mini-bar, air-conditioning, desk) faced the Campo and in the early morning -- when one opens the green shutters -- it seems as though a mini-operetta is taking place right before your eyes -- as the Campo comes to life -- the church bells ring, the kiosk opens, the t-shirt stall rolls in, the water colorist sets up his easel, the Venetians are walking to work with the grace that they alone bring to walking. It is an art in motion -- this sense of being Venetian. And in the evening, when you return to your room, sometimes, if you are lucky you will hear the voice of an angel singing in the Campo. On the Campo, there is the Church, the classy Ristorante del Giglio (don't miss it), a glass shop, a gllery, a textile boutique, an antique print shop and over on one bridge is the ALA's Ristorante da Raffaele -- run by Renato Salmaso -- it is on a canal and the gondolas float by as one dines al fesco on fine food in the soft and sensuous moonlight -- bliss! We have stayed at the ALA many times -- our last visit was for a month in May -- and we felt as though we were actually living in Venice. It can't get better than that!

Not big mind you, but definitely larger than our room at the Hotel Ala. But, we could laugh at this this. Its about the whole experience right? They were nice enough in the beginning to show us another room...just as tiny, so we stayed put. Breakfast was good. Staff in the dining area looked very unhappy to be there both mornings that we dined. The thing that would keep us from coming back the most though, besides the horrible value, was when our friend, who was staying at a different hotel, came to meet us in the lobby at a specified time and was first told we werent even staying there and then very curtly told she couldnt wait there when she tried to approach the breakfast room where we were, to try and find us. She wasnt going to eat. She was only trying to find us. Then she was even told she couldnt wait inside the lobby. The front desk acted oblivious and unbelieving to the situation even though the employee who did this was standing right there right after it happened. Oh well, you cant win them all. Ive traveled many places without a lot of expectations. Ive stayed in many types of hotels and accommodations. From 1-5 star. My friend has too. I picked this one based on Tripadvisor reviews. I realize this wont be everyone's experience. But this was ours and we would never recommend it or stay here again. It was the poorest experience we had with our hotels over our two week stay in Italy. We can laugh at it now but it was seriously disappointing at the time. I was sent a survey afterward and a follow-up email from the hotel. They actually seemed confused about it at the time it happened , and there was still some question when I received the survey which was confusing to me considering how it obviously affected everyone.

This year, we stayed in a double deluxe room on the third floor - the windows were much smaller, but the room seemed bigger. Furniture was new and expensive-looking, and the bathroom looked new and spotlessly clean, with a jakuzzi. One small problem - there were no Q-tips and cotton balls in the bathroom, so bring your own. Wireless internet worked well, and was cheap - 2 euro per day. Buffet breakfast was very good - lots of pastry and cakes, fresh fruit, quality cheeses, yoghurt (including low-fat), 5 or 6 kinds of cereal in individual small boxes, eggs, olives, mushrooms etc. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I booked the room for 10 nights, but a week before the trip I found out that my return flight was canceled, so I had to fly back home one day later. I contacted the hotel manager Andrea asking to prolong my stay for 1 night, and he generously prolonged it for free! By the way, in a square nearby the hotel (I think it was St. Mauruzio, but I'm not sure) a flea market works one weekend a month. It's highly worth browsing, especially for ladies - there were lots of beautiful things, antique jewelry, bead-embroidered victorian purses etc. When I visit Venice again, I'll most likely choose Hotel Ala again, but next time I will specifically ask for a second-floor room with french windows.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic find\u201d", "Author": "Liz100f", "ReviewID": "UR29474089", "Content": "We were very impressed with this stunning hotel.

We got a screaming deal - 80 euros a night - by booking directly from the hotel's web site and responding to a web special. The rooms were small, and the bathroom even smaller, but who spends much time in their hotel room in Venice anyway? The rooms were super-clean. The bed was a little too firm for our taste. The location was great, halfway between St. Mark's Square and the Accademia art museum. Like many hotels in Venice, it can be a little bit of a hassle to find if you're hauling luggage and don't know your way around. We took the Alilaguna in from the airport and got off at St. Mark's Square. We started to buy vaporetto tickets to the Santa Maria del Giglio stop (one stop from St. Mark's), but the friendly ticket seller let us know that the hotel was only 5 minutes walk away and gave us directions. That saved us 6 euros each. We had to cross three bridges to get to the hotel - a bit of a challenge with luggage but not bad if you have wheeled luggage and only one bag per person. If you get off the Alilaguna, walk straight ahead to St. Mark's Square. Turn left and leave the square at the back left corner (opposite St. Mark's Cathedral). Just stay on the winding street, following signs to Accademia. From St. Mark's Square you'll cross two bridges and run right into the hotel. You could also take a water taxi from the airport directly to the hotel - it has its own dock on a canal. If you have lots of luggage or a large group, that would make the most sense. Or you can take the previously mentioned vaporetto one stop from St. Mark's. There's a little alley that leads about 100 yards from the vaporetto stop directly past the hotel.

There was a wide choice and we never managed to try all the items that we really wanted. The locations is brilliant. It is so close to the main city sites that we would pop back 3 or 4 times each day to drop shopping off, pop to the bathroom or just for a few moments out the sun and then off again.

First thing I should mention is GO TO VENICE! It is unparalled to any other city and certainly doesn't disappoint. Be careful where you stay in Venice and read the location carefully. Venice also covers mainland Italy and staying there would leave a fair commute to the sights everyday. Hotel Ala is a 3 star Deluxe although I can't see how. It is up there with the rest of them and there are only a handful of 4 and 5 stars anyway and they are expensive!!! We stayed in a Deluxe Room and it is worth the upgrade. Instead of 220 euros per night for a standard room it was 260 euros. When you pay that much for a room you may aswell stretch a bit more for a bigger room. Venice is extremely expensive. Rooms, drinks, food, gondoliers, taxis souvenirs etc. The only thing reasonable is the waterbus which is a god send at 16 euros for 24 hour travelcard to anywhere. A gondolier will set you bet about 80 euros for a 45 min tour which seems strangley worth it as you see places you can only get to on a gondolier. Our water taxi airport tranfer was about 90 euros but, again, bearing in mind it was 45 mins on a speedboat, it was relatively good value (In San Marco Sq, 2 club sandwiches and a tea and a wine was 63 euros!!). It is probably the best city I have ever been to and I doubt anyone would regret going. Just remember to bring the credit card!! Hotel Ala is seconds from San Marco Sq and has a taxi, gondolier and bus stop about 50m away as it is just set back from the Grand Canal. I would recommend it. Remember, all the hotels are old and the rooms everywhere are small. The main differences in Venice hotels is the location.

We were unable to use the bar since there was a private party there the night we stayed. The hotel also has lifts which makes transport of luggage much easier. The hotel appears to have two wings. We were in the wing to the north of the lobby which does not appear to be as ornate as the other wing, but was still quite nice. The room was quite large, with a queen size bed, good sized bathroom, and nice linens. The view out of the two windows (this was a corner room) was very good. Everything in the room appeared to be newly redone. The inclusion of a digital safe was a big plus. We had no complaints about the room at all. The included breakfast is a very large spread and even included scrambled eggs.

I booked this hotel directly on the Best Western website after reading many positive reviews on this website, and we were happy with our choice in the end. Location: I loved the location of the hotel. After we arrived at the Ferrovia train station, we bought the 3-day vaporetto pass right away. We took the #1 Vaporetto to the Santa Maria Di Giglio stop. The ride was approximately 45 minutes. After geting off the Vaporetto there was only one way to go. We passed through a narrow alley way that was less that 100 ft long, and the hotel was right in front of us. The hotel was a 5 minute walk to San Marco square, and short walks from a few other lovely squares, restaurants, cafes, shops, etc. Room: We booked a standard room at 220 Euros per night. We got a room on the 2nd floor facing the square, with a lovely flowerbox in the room window. We never took the elevator in the hotel, we walked up a short flight of stairs (which has faux-marble steps and railings) and our room was almost right at the top of the staircase. At the top of the stairs there was an interesting display of antique armor and weapons. The room was not large by any means but adequate, and it was spotlessly clean. The furnishings were fairly new and well-kept; floor was hardwood, there was a flat-panel TV. The mattress was firm; I happen to like firm mattresses, but I can see how a lot of people wouldn't like it. The pillows, however, were too firm and too overstuffed. We both woke up with neck pain and a headache (and no, the headache was not from drinking all that delicious prosecco). The bathroom was white tiles with a pretty floral tile trim and has a pretty flower shaped light fixture, again spotlessly clean. We didn't have a bathtub, only a semi-circular shaped shower enclosure. The enclosure door didn't close properly all the way and when we showered the floors got quite wet. The hairdryer was on the weak side and took a while to dry hair. The sink was a small pedestal sink and didn't have any counterspace on which to put my bath/beauty products. They mounted a cubbyhole on the wall for this purpose, but the cubbyhole was tiny and on the wall opposite of the sink, and over the toilet. I guess in general it wouldn't be a problem with most other people but I am a beauty product junkie and this was a minor inconvenience that I could deal with. Breakfast: Too bad we never got a chance to go to the bar in the evenings or got a chance to go to the roof-top terrace. We did have breakfast there every morning. The selection was large: there was a good assortment of breads, cheeses, cold-cuts, olives, peppers, cereals, fruits, eggs, etc. The pastry was from an outside bakery, the croissants were kept gently warm, and it was delicious. Of the 3 days that I was at this hotel I never ran out of new choices at breakfast. The coffee was dreadful, however, extremely weak and no coffee taste or aroma at all. Cappuccino can be ordered at additional cost. Staff: The staff were helpful and polite. The front desk were efficient and made good recommendations for restaurants. They almost always had a smile. The housekeeping staff worked hard, and even though we only had a standard room, the beds were turned down in the evening. Overall, we were very satisfied with this hotel.

I was a little hesitant about which vaporetto to use to get us to the resort, but it ended up being very easy (the #1 vaporetto - 6 euros from Piazzale Roma). The hotel is just at the end of a narrow alleyway and is very well situated in relation to St. Mark's Square, Rialto Bridge, etc. The front desk guys were very helpful. We had some strange electrical problems in the room. A lamp was knocked over and this caused all the lights to go out in the room, but the bellman flicked the breaker down the hall and all was well. Then, the next morning, the light bulb above the sink just decided to drop out of its socket, but they replaced it right away and flicked the breaker again! For those of you not used to small European hotels, they want you to drop off the key before you leave for the day, and they'll give it back to you when you return. You wouldn't want to carry it with you anyway...it's huge! The elevators are REALLY tiny (somehow we fit two large men, one small bellman, and a suitcase and it was TIGHT) and the hotel floors are split in two, so you may have friends staying on the same floor but you can't get to their room unless you go to the lobby and go up the other side. Quirky but not a big deal. Be SURE to check out the rooftop patio...it is a wonderful retreat and there is a phone up there if you want to order breakfast. There is also a small bar area that is very comfortable just off the lobby. An example of prices - a gin and tonic was 8 euros. The bartender was very helpful in recommending a local restaurant and it was very good. The breakfast buffet was very good, too, and was included in our rate. I haven't mentioned the room...we checked out everyone's room in our group...they were all different...we had one triple in the group and it didn't appear to be very comfortable, but our double room was just right. Antique furniture and situated right above a canal with serenading gondolas passing by at night (room 275). The shower was very powerful and bathroom very nice and clean.

As requested, we got a room on the narrow canal next to the hotel with French doors opening onto a small balcony. This canal is used by many gondoliers, so we not only saw a parade of gondolas gliding below us, but were serenaded by singers and accordion players in some of them, too. It was a quintessential Venetian experience. The lobby area of the hotel was quite nice, but our room and its furnishings seemed dated. Likewise, the bathroom and its fixtures seemed dated. Also, there is a building right across the narrow canal from the hotel which is taller than the hotel, so that our room was constantly dark, even in broad daylight. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ventilation system had been turned off, so that the only way to get air was to open the French doors. And as soon as we did that, there was always a group of mosquitoes ready to give us their own special welcome to Venice. The included breakfast buffet in a very pleasant dining room off the lobby was good and included scrambled eggs, cured meats, yogurt, cheeses, pastries, breads, fruit, juice, and cereal. Internet service was available on a computer near the breakfast room and cost about 5E per half hour. Internet cafes were hard to find and were about the same price as the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer. The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. If you take the vaporetto, you get off at the Santa Maria del Giglio stop and walk straight down a narrow sidewalk between two buildings. After about 50-100 yards, the sidewalk opens to a small piazza, and hotel is on your left. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly leisurely 10-15 minute walk to Piazza San Marco and about the same to the Accademia Bridge, Accademia Museum and Peggy Guggenheim Museum. A 20 minute walk will get you to the Rialto Bridge and the fish and produce market. We were right in the middle of everything we wanted to see and do in Venice. We found the staff to be very friendly, and they were very helpful in suggesting restaurants. We enjoyed both of their dinner recommendations. We also found a terrific salumeria near the hotel, where we bought outstanding prosciutto naturale with pecorino cheese sandwiches for our train ride to Florence. On our last visit to Venice we stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure, which we feel is a much better hotel than Hotel Ala, but its location right across from the train station is too far from the things we like to see and do in Venice. At Hotel Ala we could stroll through Piazza San Marco late at night and be back in our room about 15 minutes later. Our room at Hotel Ala was the most expensive of the 12 hotels we stayed in on our 12 city visit to Western Europe and provided the least value. One bonus, however, is that since Hotel Ala is a Best Western member, we received a lot of points in our Crown Club account. We definitely want to stay in the San Marco area on our next visit but would probably not stay at Ala at the price we paid.

The bar downstairs was great and the bartenders were lots of fun! We had heard that Venice can be smelly in the Summer. We did not experience this at all.

Previously I stayed at the Best Western San Marco. After having stayed at BW San Marco I was reluctant to try another BW in Venice. We researched and found some great reviews on Hotel Ala. This hotel in my opinion has everything you would want in Venice. The hotel in VERY close to San Marco Square. It is very easy to find and has convenient canal access for water taxis. We traveled to Venice with our 2 year. Having a nice buffet breakfast was extremely helpful. The staff is actually very nice and will take time to give you directions and suggestions. We were going on a cruise from Venice so we stayed at the Ala two days before and two days after our cruise. Both times we had very nice and clean rooms. The bathrooms in the hotel are all new and very clean. The rooms are spacious for hotels in Venice. I would most likely stay at the Ala again. This is a 3 star hotel but in reality is far better than any other 3 starr hotel in Venice. The rates during summer are high but not as high as some of the other hotels. If you get bored of the San Marco area you can venture off to the Accadamia area (which is right behind the hotel). I can't really think of a downside. Don't waste your time going to Murano. The hotel offers a complimentary service to Murano but it's not worth the high pressure sales pitch you get when you arrive at the glass factory in Murano. Most if not all rooms require you to take the stairs. But don't worry the staff will help you with the luggage. Venice is a wonderful city stay at the Ala and you will get a better feel for it.

The water bus to the airport takes 1 hour from San Marco, which takes 10 minutes walk to reach, it costs 10Euro one way, reasonable.
