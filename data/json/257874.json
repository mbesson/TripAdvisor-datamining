I was worried by some reviews but pleasantly surprised. We stayed in the standard queen and whilst it was small it was roomy enough for us and the decor most unique. Tiny entry to the bathroom looked like a cupboard but surprisingly spacious and it was spotlessly clean. Didn't see any evidence of dirtiness or lack of maintenance described by other reviewers. Perhaps the owners have taken on comments and undertaken improvements. Charming guest common room and the area for breakfast in the Atrium looked good. Didn't get to test the food as we had an early departure. Perfect location for SCG, Football stadium and Hordern Pavillion.

Our room, No 3, had a large sitting room with flat screen TV, tea and coffee making facilities, a ward robe, ironing board and bar fridge, not to mention a comfy couch. Our bed room had a king sized bed, flat screen TV and an en-suite bathroom. There was also another bathroom off the sitting room with a toilet and bath/shower and hand basin. The sitting room and bed room have their own air con systems. Even though this room is at the front of the hotel there was no street noise to mention. The hotel has a large communal sitting room with cable TV with tea and coffee available for guesta, there is also a computer for guest use, or free wifi if you have your own computer. The breakfast area is a light and airy atrium with a small pool in one corner. Breakfast consists of cereal, yoghurt, fruit and toast [do it yourself] as well as brewed coffee and tea making, the area is large and does not feel cramped if other guests are present. There are plenty of restaurants and bars close by for meals as well as a list of take away delivery services. A must try is the Greek restaurant in Oxford street, the lamb shoulder is melt in the mouth tender. The Hotel is an easy 25/30 minute walk into the CBD crossing through Hyde Park. there are also plenty of bus connections available.

The hotel is on a busy road but you can't hear any traffic noises, nor were we disturbed by any other guests, so I think the walls must be quite thick, which is always good!
