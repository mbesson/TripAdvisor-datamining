It is close to all major college and University campuses in this Florida area as well as the technology park. We were visiting Rollins and UCF. Our room was a King bed suite. It had separate sleeping/bathroom area, and sitting/kitchen area. Two large screen televisionsand a very comfy couch. The kitches is perfect, with full size refrigerator, dishwasher,garbage disposal and stove top. There is a small table for two to dine comfortably or to use as a desk for work. They provide a large breakfast selection in the lobby and a welcome home evening meal that is out of this world. They even say \"Welcome Home\" when you return later on in the day and evening. The lobby has ample dining tables as well as soft couches and chairs. There is a pool area and patio with umbrella tables to relax. The business center is well stocked and very available with room card access. Everything is very clean and user friendly. There are plenty of parking spaces. Also, there are side and back enterances with room card access so you will not have to be concerned about parking away from the front door. You are always only steps from an enterance as long as you have your room key. The hotel shares a parking lot with Walgreens, so do not worry if you forget anything. The front desk associates will see to your every need while staying there. They provided me written directions to every destination I needed, and provided plenty of hospitality.

The hotel is far from any attraction but is located in a pretty quiet area and is close to shopping and dining. The hotel itself is quiet. To get to Disney will take you about 45 minutes and you will pay a bit in tolls. You also pay tolls to get to the hotel from the airport. The rooms are very small, not what I've had in other Homewood Suites. The closet is a joke and the door won't open far enough to get a suitcase in to sit on the luggage rack. The bathroom and sink area are very small and the sink is open to the bedroom. The beds are uncomfortable and the pillows are like rocks. The sofa and chair are worn out and the decor is unattractive. When we came back after our first day of activities the bed had been made and dirty towels removed, but nothing in the bathroom had been wiped or cleaned and the empty Kleenex box hadn't even been replaced. To give the staff credit, I complained and the rest of our stay the room was nicely cleaned and they left us an apology gift basket. They even dusted the top of the tv armoire which I hadn't mentioned but obviously hadn't been dusted in a long time. The front desk staff is excellent and very helpful. The lobby is attractive. The breakfast is just average. I've had much better at other properties. All in all, this hotel is just average and next time I would pick one more centrally located.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesterfield, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cExceptional by far the BEST Hotel we have ever stayed!!\u201d", "Author": "MelissaT925", "ReviewID": "UR100125599", "Content": "We recently stayed at Homewood Suites while we were visiting Full Sail University with our teenage son.

He was always helpful and accommodating and even went out his way to make me some cookies as they were closing up the buffet in the evening. Yum!

Because we would have 4 in the party - for privacy, and convenience, we wanted a suite. This hotel was close to UCF, advertised that it was a \"suites\" hotel, AND IT WAS A HILTON HOTEL. We've always had good experiences with Hilton which has the reputation of being a quality chain. I'm a smoker as well, and I know that if you book online, sometimes you're told that room types can't be guaranteed. I called the reservation line and booked a confirmed reservation several weeks in advance, confirming with a credit card. I received confirmation for a King Suite, Smoking for our trip. It was more than an 8 hour drive from our home in Myrtle Beach, SC to Orlando, Florida. When we arrived, we were told by the desk clerk that OUR ROOM WASN'T AVAILABLE B/C A PRIOR GUEST HAD EXTENDED THEIR STAY AND A MANAGER HAD APPROVED THIS. They offered a Queen Smoking suite. Now, I wasn't going to make a big deal about a queen bed verses a King bed and it was a \"suites\" hotel, so, I was unhappy, but agreed to accept the Queen Suite. Only one problem - when we got to the room, it WASN'T A SUITE. I called downstairs, very unhappy. Was told nothing else was available and they'd let us know when OUR RESERVED ROOM BECAME AVAILABLE. A day later, we still weren't in our confirmed room. When I reaced another employee, we were told we couldn't have our ORIGINAL ROOM BECAUSE A PRIOR GUEST HAD LEFT A SUITCASE IN THE ROOM AND UNDER FLORIDA LAW, IF A SUITCASE IS LEFT IN A ROOM, THE HOTEL CAN'T BOOK IT TO ANOTHER GUEST FOR 2 DAYS. We'd also booked this hotel b/c it advertised on the web site that it had a video arcade - a good amenity when you're traveling with an 11 year old. Problem? False advertising. The hotel doesn't actually have a video arcade. The one time my husband tried to take the 11 year old swimming at the outdoor pool, they found it so dirty that my hubby didn't think it would be safe for my son to swim there. The night before we were to leave we got a call that our original suite was available and the room was right next door to the one we were in. My family was off at Disneyquest for the only \"entertainment\" we had time for in our trip. There was no point moving for several hours. Also, we'd seen another guest coming and going from the room. GUESS WHICH EXPLANATION WAS THE TRUTH?? I doubted the second one from the get-go because I'm from Myrtle Beach - also a tourist town - and couldn't imagine that the hospitality industry wouldn't be up in arms over a law that allowed a guest to hold them hostage by simply leaving a suitcase behind. I emailed Hilton the night we arrived to tell them we were very unhappy. Hilton did nothing. The hotel never even offerred to book us into another hotel that would offer the accommodation we reserved and confirmed but didn't get at Homewood Suites. Turned out the hotel had nonsmoking suites available. I suggested they move us and that the hotel pay for any cleaning costs to deoderize the room from my \"smoking\" but they refused to do that. DON'T STAY AT HOMEWOOD SUITS. IN FACT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVOID HILTON ALTOGETHER. This hotel doesn't honor reservations and Hilton Doesn't have any honor.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cSAVIOR!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "NycSnob", "ReviewID": "UR31508116", "Content": "This place was FAB!!!! it was not over the top. but it was VERY NEAT AND CLEAN and just what the Doctor ordered.
