It is one of the houses opposite the road from the Museum's ice skating rink. There are running numbers on the pillars so you cannot miss it. I had a good stay at 54. No doubt about it. The location was fab. Easy access to the Tube. Near the major museums. Near a few eating places and more importantly, offering all that while not having to put up with the noise & crowds associated with Piccadily Circus, Leicester Sq or Oxford Circus hotels. Overall, the decor was simple but tasteful. I was a little surprised to see that the reception / check in counter was exactly that - a counter or a hole in the wall, merged with a small bar counter in an equally compact breakfast area. Compact is a good word to use to describe the hotel. It is obvious that the hotel was converted from a residential property - so the living room become a breakfast area / bar and various bedrooms became hotel rooms of different configuration and size. We were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room on the top floor - possibly b'cos we were staying for a few nights and there weren't many other people in the hotel due to the uncharacteristic arctic weather in London. The room (Room 24, 4th floor) was quite large by London standards and was pleasantly decorated. Nothing too fancy or over the top. Just what you would expect from a decent business or boutique hotel. I even had a view of the National History Museum and Imperial College & despite the room facing Queens Gate road, there was hardly any traffic noise. The room, especially the bathroom was a little cool but not too cold - I have stayed at other hotels where the room was warm but the bathroom was freezing. One thing to note though. The lift only goes up to the 2nd floor. So any room from nos 19 onwards would have to be accessed via a flight of stairs. Rooms 22 to 26 were accessed by yet another flight of windy (small) stairs. Also, certain rooms are along the small corridor where you can hardly walk 2 abreast e.g. room 18 or 19, so I expect those rooms to have to put up with noise from footsteps on creaky wooden floorboards. Staff seemed to be uniformly non-British and mostly fairly young. The housekeeping staff were, we suspect, nearly all E. European ladies while the reception, save that one middle-aged man in the day - were all men in their late twenties or early thirties. Mostly quite friendly, especially the chap who did the night shift. Lots of smiles and was very patient. My only wee grouse was that one young chap who did the day shift who was not very conversant, very matter-of-fact but he was nonetheless, professional and was quick with his responses. We had a good chat with the middle-aged chap at breakfast about the cold weather - he advised us to wrap up warm. Breakfast was continental. Croissants and 2 kinds of each of the following : ham, cheese, toast (white & multi-grain), yogurt, pastries and fruit. There was 3 kinds of boxed cereal but only 1 kind of milk (semi-skimmed) and 1 kind of juice (orange). So, its nothing to crow about but something light to start your day. I found the hotel rates very reasonable for what I got, albeit I did get a good promotional rate. Given the choice of the Radisson Edwardian, Millennium and other hotels in the area, I would still pick 54 the next time....", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cwouldnt stay here\u201d", "Author": "holsaregreatUk", "ReviewID": "UR89894690", "Content": "I wouldn\u2019t stay here again and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.

First room was a standard double - some evidence of \"boutification\" but not exactly extensive.

Desk guy helped by moving me to the lower ground floor (cellar I guess) - to a \"junior suite\". Bigger, radiators still not working and same average bathroom and trippy 70's furniture. Much bigger as well. Almost big enough to justify the large skylight directly over the bed with only a wonkey bamboo blind to keep out daylight.

The Piccadilly line runs from here and you can get to Heathrow in about 40 mins. The Natural History Museum is over the road and it is about a 5 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall. Turn left out of the hotel and walk to the top of the road and you will find the Royal Albert Hall on your right and straight ahead is the entrance to Hyde Park and the Albert Memorial which is fanastic. A 10 minute stroll through the park will lead you to High Street Kensington.

South Ken is beautiful but pretty empty at night so be aware that walking back from the tube at night you might be one of not many people on the street. Still, never felt unsafe. 5) Just a tip to know, if you can book your cab to/from airport online it's better than booking through hotels. The hotels all rip you off and charge like 50 pounds. Online you can find nice limo services for as little as 20 pounds! 6) There is wi-fi at this hotel but there is no computer to use so y ou need to bring your laptop or your iphone.", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat value...great area of London\u201d", "Author": "AndrewsD", "ReviewID": "UR46353362", "Content": "My son and I traveled to London in October 2009.

We booked through a hotel website and were quoted \u00a3139 for the standard double room inclusive of continental breakfast. We must admit that some of the comments read on the Tripadvisor reviews did put some doubt as to whether we had done the right thing, but we were pleasantly surprised, and had a very comfortable and agreable stay. We travelled to the hotel by tube, alighting at Gloucester Road station. We timed our walk to the hotel to be exactly 6 minutes walking at a gentle pace, with bags to carry. We fail to understand the comments about the long distance of this hotel from the tube station! Upon arrival, we were given a choice of a smaller room facing the rear on a lower floor, or a larger room on the 4th floor facing the road. We chose the latter, and were not disappointed. There is a small lift to the second floor only, and you have two flights of stairs to the top. Unless you were serious disabled, in which case the point would be valid, we failed to see how this was a problem to some...But if this is an issue, then best to request a room up to the second floor only. Our room at the top had great views of the Natural History museum, and was pleasantly quiet and free from traffic noise. Our room had ample storage and hanging space for our evening wear (we were going to an evening 'black tie' function), and would have been ok for storing several days' worth of clothing. The room was equipped with a safe which worked perfectly, the bathroom had a large shower where one does not get bruises knocking the sides and the normal complimentary toiletries were of good quality, but please, not luxurious as some mentioned! There was ample supply of towels too. There was very efficient air conditioning which kept the room at a comfortable temperature. The bed was a large kingsize which was arguably a tad too large for the room, there was just enough space to move from one side to the other one person at a time! But this is London after all, and the property is a grand old house where all rooms were former residences, and it is normal to expect a huge variation in the size and shapes of those rooms. The bland all rooms the same the world over of large hotel chains it ain't. We found the bed ultra comfortable, but the bedding was a little too warm (big fluffy duvet) for the time of the year. A lighter version would have been perfect. The duvet was a little on the small side for the size of the bed, too, but we did not find this a problem as we spent most of our night above the covers rather than under as it was too warm to stay under! The standard of the decoration was simple, neutral, but spotless. The carpet was very clean, we did not find one stain on it. The room smelled fresh and inviting, and the free bottle water was welcome after a long and sweaty train and tube journey. We loved the snug bar/coffee lounge by the reception. We ordered a nice bottle of wine, and sipped away at it for a while reading the papers. Coffee and tea was very good too, and free all day. The wine was very reasonably priced at \u00a315 a bottle, which we thought was also cheap for London. The continental breakfast bar was ample for our needs. Finally, we paid what we were quoted, and the staff was courteous, helpful without being intrusive. The night porter was opening the door for us when we returned very late even before we had rung the bell! We would certainly return to this hotel for short stays in London, it is one of the best finds we have made in a long time. The access to the West end is excellent, and the location is great, the hotel is comfortable without pretence, and the staff were polite and helpful.", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cLoved the White Wine Taster Evenings!!!!\u201d", "Author": "leem123", "ReviewID": "UR7751507", "Content": "This boutique hotel is a hidden gem right in the heart of London's musuems and hyde park.

No need to say that we could not believe this and the attitude of the person at the reception at the beginning was also quite aggressive. He also knew that he gave us the key of a Standard room but still pretended it was for the Suite according to his comment when he gave us the key.

We found it brilliant in all respects, noting it had no air conditioning (problematic if London gets hot) and the elevator does not reach the top floor. Service was excellent, the staff knowledgeable and the facilities very comfortable if not plush. We added it to on our short list of properties to recommend in London. That stay merited 4 or 5 filled circles. We still think the queensgate is a good value given its prime location if you get an internet discounted rate but are less enthusiastic going forward. The proximity to both the south kensington and the gloucester road tube stops is a big advantage. Lots of restaurants, convenient bus service, a quieter neighborhood and relatively close to the Heathrow for central London hotels are all good reasons to stay in the Kensington area. Pros: beds and bed linens comfortable; nice soaps, lotions and shampoos; continental breakfast and beverages included in package we booked and plentiful; the breakfast guy is very service oriented; breakfast area/bar are conducive to socializing or relaxing. Cons: The biggest change we noted was the inconsistency in service. Everyone who works there is most polite, and two in particular did an outstanding job of helping us with restaurant reservations and other advice. Internet access was pricey (10 pounds per day for wired or wireless) and difficult to access. The other hesitation in our recommendation is the need for greater attention to maintenance and some upgrading of facilities. Our room safe (not big enough for a laptop if you're wondering) had a low battery. We called it to reception's attention four days in a row before it was fixed. The light over the sink kept turning on & off. The carpets are clean but starting to look worn. The mattress was starting to sag; one bathrobe had a sizeable hole in the front. The room has one undersized stool that's uncomfortable for more than the minute or so it takes to tie one's shoes. The desk surface had a lot of water stains. None of these are \"deal killers\" in and of themselves; but taken as a whole, the impression is the facilities will continue to decline between visits.

The Hotel on the surface is quite smart - however, there are sogns of ageing - decor is a bit rough round the edges and the carpets I do admit are stained (though most places in London are!). Our room was very noisy in the night - due to a badly fitting door which rattled. Also the cleaning staff did seem to congregate outside our room very early in the morning.
