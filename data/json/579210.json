We were looking for good accommodations but the really good ones are expensive. I came across South East Asia Hotel here in TripAdvisor. They are located in Bugis, where I stayed before when I was traveling solo, so I emailed them. They replied promptly. The location is brilliant - 5mins to Bugis MRT, Bras Basah MRT and several bus stops. It's right in the middle of the city and really close to great shopping and eating locations like Bugis Street and Bugis Junction. Waterloo street is super charming in the day, very colorful. There are many flower stands because of the Chinese and Indian temples. The path is also shaded by trees, allowing for a nice morning walk. Farther down, you'll find the Singapore Art Museum. From there you can go anywhere in the city either by foot or bus or MRT. The interior/lobby is simple and small. The lift can probably fit only 5 people but it's fast. The front desk people were pleasant, and unlike some of the reviews, we didn't meet anyone who was less than friendly. We booked 2 rooms - 1 double and 1 twin. Both rooms were adequate, really clean and spacious enough for 2 people in each room. Both ACs worked fine. There was a TV and a water heater with coffee and tea in each room. The bathrooms were small and basic but very clean. As for the heater, it takes a while to get the prefect temperature, but it becomes easier every time you use it. It was kind of weird, though, that there's no division between the toilet and the shower and that the sink in the double room was outside the bathroom. I also wished they had a hair dryer. The rooms are cleaned EVERYDAY. Everyday, there were fresh, new and clean towels and the beds are always made up, the carpets cleaned. Every night, the bathroom floors are dry and clean, which is a plus for me as I hate wet bathroom floors. Kudos to the staff! The rooms are secure and our things stayed safe inside. The rates include either continental or buffet vegetarian breakfast. We called the veggie breakfast \"the magic breakfast\" since we noticed that we stayed full until 2pm. It tasted good, too.

The hotel is located near MRT station, Bugis Junction, 7 Eleven, fruit stand and a market where you can find cheap stuff. It is near 2 temples and a museum. This hotel is being run by a family of older people. Although there was one lady who was quite accommodating, I think some of them needs a lesson on customer service. They think that if they talk louder(to the extent of shouting) we can understand what they are talking about. Sometimes they came across as rude, specially in the morning while having breakfast. They should post a message in English stating the process of getting a breakfast. Yes, a process. Since you have to get a colored coupon representing what breakfast you prefer, vegetarian or continental, then give it to a guy in the kitchen. Quiet simple but sign language and nasal blah blah will get us nowhere. We had breakfast there twice and I saw them telling (more like shouting) a few guests the process in exasperation like how can you not understand what I'm saying. . . Our bedroom carpet needs a shampoo not just a good vacuuming. Its really filthy. The room is quite big though considering that it's in Singapore. The elevator is ancient but functional. it was I think their 56 year anniversary on the day we checked in. So the building was that old or older. Bed's comfortable, the toilet is so small but clean with no division or shower curtain so everything gets wet while showering. A dispenser for liquid soap/shampoo. shower curtain. The room is supplied with Coffe/tea electric pot. There's an old 14\" tv, aircon temp.cannot be controlled and there's a ceiling fan too. Come check out time, I told the woman that we are checking out. She took our key and checked some papers, then called someone on the phone. I stood in front of her for 15minutes, waiting to be released. Then after 15minutes she asked me if I'm waiting for anything. I told her we we're waiting to be checked out. She said you book through a travel agency, you paid already. So all along I had been standing in front of her waiting for her to say that we can go but not even a nod or a finger pointing at the door, I could have understood that.

If you paid just S$140 for a room good for 4 persons plus free breakfast, I think it's wise to say that you shouldn't expect the Marina Bay Sands...or even Intercon or Peninsula for that matter. South East Asia Hotel is a budget hotel located right at the heart of the pedestrian mall that is Bugis. It is near two temples and right smack in the middle of urban Singapore: there will be noise coming from the flower vendors, the fortune tellers and the many pedestrians who flock on the street to buy either flowers for their deity or beef jerky for home. First, let me state the obvious: South East Asia Hotel is quite an ancient hotel (more than 50 years old) which still manages to provide a good place to sleep and chill when you are not busy pounding Singapore's pavement. The door leading to the reception says it recently celebrated its 55th? or 57th? anniversary and the truth is: it shows. The carpet is quite old, there are few cracks in the bathroom tiles and the furniture is quite outdated, but for S$140: you will be sure that you will have a safe, comfortable environment you can call your \"temporary home\" at night. In Singapore where everything is expensive, SEA Hotel is heaven sent to those who would like to find a nice, comfortable place to stay minus the prohibitive price tag. The rooms might be old but they are well-maintained, plus the family who runs it are nice and accommodating. Previous reviews here state that 'auntie\" (at the reception) is quite rude--but I never felt any rudeness from her. In fact, everyone was so nice and accommodating. I think its just the matter of how the Singaporeans speak that they are mistaken for brash behavior. They are accommodating and kind, and won't even shy away from small talk. The rooms are quite old, but they are well maintained and comfortable. The room assigned to us (3-52) has a big bathroom plus the bed is comfortable for sleeping. They even laid out a few basic toiletries plus coffee and tea for those who want to have coffee whilst in the room. The aircon takes a bit of time to really \"cold up\" but once it reaches it's temperature, it's comfortable and conducive for sleeping. What I like: * the location: witness commerce, religion and faith in just one street. close enough to Bugis MRT. * the personnel: big props to auntie who checked us in, and the kind uncle manning the night shift * the FREE breakfast--just because i don't have to pay for it. menu can be repetitive though. however, it's a BUFFET breakfast (vegetarian choice) so you can load up before you start going around Singapore What I don't like/can be improved: * The elevator which was old! But it was efficient and fast though--I just don't like being inside old lifts * towels were not changed everyday. * vegetarian menu can be repetitive Over all, I would recommend SEA to my friends--I'd even go back there should I get lucky and have the funds to go back to SG by next year.

After the wait in the airport (just 3 people in the bus, it WAS 3AM already by the time we left the airport, after all), the driver proceeded to take me to the hotel. I recognized the area immediately because I stayed in the Intercontinental Hotel in Bugis on my last trip to this wonderful country, but South East Asia Hotel was situated in a side I was not familiar with. As some reviews here have stated, it is on a pedestrian street, but as I arrived 330AM already at the hotel, it was eerily quiet - and would lull you to think that this was a quiet area - far from it during the day, haha. This is one of the more \"chaotic\" areas in the day, and as some people in my party were from the USA, they were taken aback at how humid and stifling the weather was (November), although I was acclimatized since I was from the Philippines, which shares the same weather conditions. The man who received me at the hotel was very, very nice - and quite solicitous for someone serving at 330AM. They have their own \"accounting system\" and it's best that you print out your itenerary with you, especially the hotel arrangements, so that everything is clear (in the days that followed, there was some confusion, since my party arrived in 3 stages and left different times also). SEAHotel does not accept credit cards, so you would need to either do a bank transfer (how we did it) or ask a person you know in Singapore to pay for you. I had to leave the hotel at 6/7AM because I had an exam to take along Beach Road (walkable from Hotel although quite a way off, around 15 to 20 minutes to the exam site). I requested a wake up call because I was afraid I would not wake up in time, and I was given that wake up call. The room is old but the bed was clean and the aircon was cold and can be adjusted temperature wise, something I liked. The shower (as you can see from pictures) was either above or beside the toilet bowl, with no separation, so just leave the door open to dry the bathroom. The water supply was strong and they provided soaps and towels. My breakfast that 1st day was the toast since it was still too early for the vegetarian buffet. I recommend getting the buffet to everyone, as two slices of bread cannot possibly be considered a \"good\" breakfast by any nutritionist. (Although anti carb fans will be hard pressed to choose either one, since both options are carb FULL, haha.) The radish cake and the faux meat bun were better than expected. Different people manned the reception, but all were very conversant in English. At first glance/meeting, you might think that they were curt/rude, but I think that had more to do with the way they spoke (English in a Chinese way, which some of my companions were led to ask \"Are they mad?\"). They even had time to smile and give good recommendations and directions. Overall, if all you are after is a decent and clean bed to stay in with a filling breakfast everyday, I would recommend this hotel, especially since the location is primo. Across the hotel (slightly diagonal) was Albert Center, a hawker center. Beside the hotel was a mall (not the Orchard Road variety = not the high end type) but we did get our money changed there and were able to buy some eats for gifts back home from there (preserved candies and the like). It was 3 blocks away from the MRT Bugis station, definitely less than 10 minutes walk. And it was bedside 2 temples. I would caution you from the hotel if you are the frilly, princess type who likes being waited on hand and foot - you won't get a porter to help you get your luggage.

The doorway to the hotel is under a covered walkway, so be prepared to look for it. Inside I wasn't holding much hope as the foyer was quite small and there was only one lady on reception. She was rushed off her feet with other people and the phone ringing. Having said that, I was amused and surprised that when she welcomed us she was very business like and you didn't feel rushed at all. One of our rooms wasn't ready so she checked first and then checked me in to a different room (twin instead of double) which wasn't an issue as it was only me anyway. Beware that the hotel doesn't have all the modern amenities you might be used to. THere is no printing avaiable from the internet computer (on the third floor), bookings were made via email not an oline bookign form (though it was very efficient) and most importantly, they do not take card. So make sure you have enough cash or can get enough cash to pay! Payment for the rooms is done on a daily basis and a standard room will cost you SIN$100 a night. We were on the first floor. Each room had a fridge and air con as well as a ceiling fan. There were also chairs to sit on and a desk with a mirror. The bathrooms were wet rooms with the showers just open to the rest of the bathroom which wasn't a problem in my room as it dried out overnight but with two people usign the shoer it struggled to dry out properly by morning. A TV was provided in each room with access to CNN and a few other main channels. Shampoo and soap was provided along with 3-in-1 tea and coffee satchets. The beds were comfy and the fan could be turned off though the air con could not and could be heard as per usual. You can also call between rooms easily by typing the floor number followed by the two digit room number. Useful if you have a split group. Breakfast is served quite late from 8:30am to 10am. You have a choice of continental (toast and jam with Orange juice) or vegetarian chinese buffet (noodles, rice, pastries, steamed buns). Each comes with tea or coffee. Unfortunately we only had this on the second morning as we had an early start the first morning for a city tour. Rather helpfully though they did do us the continental breakfast at the earlier time of 7:45am. Check out was easy as everything had been paid for daily and bags could be left in the cafe area if you were travelling later in the day. The taxi rank is right next to the pedestrianised bit so while you can't call a taxi from the hotel, it's probably faster to go out and get one!

Good, strong, hot shower 9. Nice people at the reception 10. Westerners might appreciate the culture as there is a Budhlist and Hindu temple next door! 11. Only s$100. If anyone has tried one with a better value, please let me know! 12. Area and hotel suitable for family. Wasn't willing to try out the Hotel 81s and Fragrance chains as I was not sure about the clientele there. The not so good: 1. Aircon is a window unit installed so high up you have to climb on a chair to adjust and turn on/off 2. No blackout curtains 3. Sellers on the pedestrian street can be noisy as they call out to potential buyers for their flowers and other things for the nearby temples 4. You carry your own bags so use a trolley bag as you'll have to drag it a short distance to the taxi stand 5. Only cash accepted and you have to pay every evening (if you decide not to pay at one go at the start) 6. Abrupt, scowling people at the breakfast/restaurant area (but we were prepared for this after reading the previous reviews. LOL) 7. No free WIFI. Have to pay for Internet access (we didnt bother.) 8. Really homely (don't expect any luxuries!) 9. No shower stall.

I think I found this place in a travel book. We didn't mind it being in a pedestrian-only street as we were walking and getting the train everywhere anyway. It's close to the art gallery (which is really good), and Raffles. The breakfast was good - European as well as some Singapore fare - though it didn't really seem the most healthy I've ever eaten. The room was pretty basic and small, but we weren't hanging out - just going back to sleep. It was quite dark and the one window was high up the wall so no view. Not that there was one anyway - our room looked out to a small lane and a building. The bathroom had an open shower, which I didn't like at all, especially for a hotel and paying $100 Singapore per night. (See the pic.) It was just a shower head on the wall, right next to the bathroom door. So you had to stand next to the door to get under the shower, and the water went everywhere, including all over the door. We had to use one of the towels across the bottom of the door so the water didn't go into the room. It was very clean, and cleaned very nicely every day, including towels and soap replaced. The linen and towels were nice too. Not so keen on having to pay every day for the room, and in cash. And the internet took forever.

I have stayed in other hotels in Singapore before but since we were on a budget (traveling to 5 countries in Asia) for this trip, I figured it would be worth the risk. The booking itself was convenient and hassle-free. I just emailed the hotel, booked our stay, and they replied with all the necessary instructions and information. On the day of our arrival, the cab driver was not instantly familiar with the hotel. We had to give the instructions they emailed, including descriptions of the nearby temple. There's also some 30-meter walk towards the entrance of the hotel from the street and no one will help you with your luggages as usually there's only 1 person in the reception and it is not visible at all from the street. We arrived at around 7:30AM and were told that \"usually check-in is at 2PM but fortunately for you, we have a room ready\" (yes we are thankful but the way he said it was like he was letting us stay in the hotel for free). Upon handing our room key, we were immediately asked for payment for the 1st night and when we told him we still have to change our money, we were asked for both our passports. They were returned as soon as we paid the $100 for our room that day. No one escorted us to our room and when we saw our room, we knew we were in for a disappointing stay. It was the smallest room by far that I have stayed in and it stank of stale cigarette smoke. These were the only amenities: a TV with 8 stations, the bed, a bedside table, a desk, a cabinet with mismatched hangers and a clothes rack for airing. If the room was disappointing, the bath even more so. It is the first time ever that I have seen a shower head right behind the door such that when you shower, the water is all over the door and the floor. You have to be very careful when taking a shower as the floor tiles are slippery because there is no bath mat or even a divider on the floor -- you basically just use up the entire CUBICLE when showering. Since we were so tired from our long flight from Australia and not wanting to have another semi-hostile encounter with reception, we did not ask for a change of room thinking that the terrible smell of smoke would go away after a while. No chance of that -- we stayed 3 nights in the same room and our clothes stank for several days after leaving Singapore. (It's hard to explain why we didn't move but our days were so jampacked, we would go back to the hotel at 3 or 4am and it was just such a hassle to transfer everything to another room). Breakfast is served from 8:30-10:30AM. You have 2 choices: American (which is 2 whole slices of toast cut into 4, a packet of butter and a packet of jam plus orange juice and coffee/tea) or Vegetarian buffet (dimsum, noodles, fried rice and some taro puff plus coffee/tea, no chance of swapping with juice!). Upon the recommendation of the old Chinese lady at the reception, we had the Veg. buffet. It was so-so but filling enough. The second day, we went down for breakfast at 10:25AM having had a long night and was met with a scowl from the old Chinese lady (you have to get your coupons daily from reception) who reprimanded us that next time, we shouldn't be so late for breakfast! Duh!!!! As it turns out, the dining area was already spotless when we got in meaning they closed breakfast waaaay earlier than 10:30. The guy in the kitchen grudgingly served us toast and coffee with both of them grumbling in Chinese the entire time. We finished our toast so fast just to get out of there and what do you know, the guy took away our plates while we were still finishing our coffee! So rude! Another thing to complain about is that there is no wi-fi in the hotel -- not a problem except that to have internet in your room, you have to pay AND leave your passport which they will only return when you give back the modem. I have no problem paying for services, after all this is a low-budget hotel but this attitude of complete distrust is simply annoying. Others have said that it is probably cultural and maybe because SEA Hotel is a family-run business but I have stayed in other places in Singapore and other family-run hotels in other countries but have never, never been treated the same way. Needless to say, we are not staying ever again in this hotel.

(ours was superior room 356, 358 had no smell) and carpet was flat and dull.But after a sleep and a shower i was quite happy and very comfortable. Rooms at front (334) and opposite (346) had views. They have no problems changing rooms though if you press it as one of our group was on another floor and wanted to be near us so they moved her when we saw a vacant room. Rooms were cleaned very well every day. The phone worked, the tv worked and so did the kettle...which was a nice extra as the budgets often don't give a kettle tea/coffee. I decided to handwash my clothing as the laundry price was expensive....so they happily gave me a drying rack and under the fan, it dried well. They also gave an iron and ironing board. When I bought flowers, they happily gave me a vase. You had a fan and an air con and at night you certainly didn't need both. Plenty of cupboard and drawer and wardrobe space. A friend who was staying at a 5 * came in and said wow, this is very spacious.. her daughter liked the cultural aspect of the hotel....which you don't get with a 5 *. Breakfast...yes it was basic, but in fairness the big hotels don't give anything. My daughter had the continental ( 2 toast, jam, juice and coffee) and I had vegetarian buffet (noodles, fried rice, fried carrot cake etc, coffee) and we went halves so each had both on the plate ( 1 toast half the rice etc). Quite a substancial breakkie. There was only one staff member that was a bit rude...and she was on at brekkie. No problems, just ignore. One older lady in reception was also a little abrupt at times but I just chatted to her and she was fine. When there was late excessive noise from one room, I made a call and security came straight up. We loved the area. They happily gave directions to anywhere. Yes we had to hand our keys in when we went out....but they always rememberd who we were and gave keys without us asking. it also is something I practice anyway so that i don't loose the key.

Both hotels are in the same vicinity. The South East Asia Hotel is closer to the MRT and the Bugis shopping area. However, we found that in spite of excellent directions that the South East Asia hotel emailed us, our taxi dropped us off on Bencoolen Street and since this hotel is on a pedestrian walkway, it was a bit of a walk with two large bags in the rain. We found that the service at the South East Asia hotel to be its biggest selling point. Very personable and welcoming. We asked for a taxi to come for us at 3:15 am and the lady at the front desk actually told us that we could get another 30 minutes of sleep and have it come at 3:45am with amble time to get to the airport and she would take care of ordering it for us. and all with a smile! The hotel is actually quite a bit larger than the small entrance would lead you to believe. The rooms are clean with no funny smells that come from the damp humid air - which is a nice reflection of the daily housekeeping that occurs. Beds were comfortable. However, the rooms are definitely \"vintage\" circa 1970s hotel type looking. If you can look past that, there's nothing wrong with the sleeping area. We had a good laugh in the bathroom. Walk in and there's no bath tub nor a shower stall, then you turn around and look behind you and there is a shower wand that is part of the bathroom. So, taking a shower in the morning? the entire bathroom is now your shower stall! All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. But it wasn't a great experience that would draw me to come back to this property. Loved the service and friendly atmosphere. Given that these two property room rates were within USD5 per night of each other we would likely go back to the Bencoolen Hotel over the South East Asia hotel as the rooms appeared to be slightly newer and more comfortable.

When I asked about that, the very friendly staffs told me that just only superior room has mini-bar, and the rate for a superior room is 100 SGD per night. But that is just a minor thing.

At $80-90 SGD a night, this hotel is about the best deal that you can find in Singapore. You do get what you pay for. I stayed in this hotel on two occasions on my vacation. I was disappointed the first time I stayed in this hotel. I had a corner room that was dimly lit. The sink is located outside the bathroom. It was a little bit further than an arm distance. The shower was literally in front of the toilet. As soon as you cross over the door in the bathroom, the shower head was at the wall. The whole space including the toilet was less than 4x4 feet. When I came back to Singapore for the second leg of my vacation, most of the hotels in Singapore were booked. I was still fortunate that this hotel had vacancy. The room that we stayed in was the Superior room $90 SGD. The room was larger and the sink was in the bathroom. The bathroom was a lot larger than the last time, but still no tub or separation of the toilet from the shower. The room was still dim. I must admit though that the beds I slept in this hotel were very comfortable. They were firm and did not feel old. The hotel is located near Bugis MRT station. Less than a 5 minute walk.

Location location - this place is excellent close to MRT'S, Little india, hawkers stores and shopping centres. There are two temples near to the hotel and every morning as you step out there is an abundance of colour as the local flower stores set up. It is located in the arts district so there is shows/ event continuously happening. 2. Price - we paid sing 80.00 a night - great for budget traveller 3. Room was tidy and bathroom was very clean, a/c worked. 4. There was construction next door, but this only started after 9.00 am and was stopped before evening..so there was no noise in the nights. 5. Breakfast - it is Singapore so the breakfast caters to the locals. Both my husband and I enjoyed the breakfast- there were 4 dishes - fried tofu or Singapore cakes, Singapore noodles, steamed rice buns with assorted filling and then a rice soup which was changed to fried rice on some days and coffee or tea. It was enjoyable change to usual toast or cereal. 6. Staff were always helpful and friendly 7. You pay cash per day, however we paid upfront for the week. The owners where very cautious to accept the week payment and made it clear that there was no refund should we change our mind.

Great hotel for budget travelers\u201d", "Author": "mamen7", "ReviewID": "UR10072939", "Content": "I came to Singapore the second time this year. The first time, I did not stay in this hotel but stayed in some hotels else such as Keong Saik, 1929 and Strand. This time, again, I followed the reviews in TripAdvisor to choose my accommodation for 8 days time in Singapore. My God, I couldn't understand why all the hotel raised their rates up to more 20 - 40% this period. Such as Bencoolen Hotel, they charged me 176 SGD per night for 2 persons. Thing was the same for some hotels else which I contacted after refusing to stay at Bencoolen. Thanks God, Keong Saik still kept their rates at an acceptable number, which was 90 SGD for a single one. However, the room was so small and I did not feel much comfortable. That's why I just stayed there only 1 night and tried to find another hotel with more reasonable rate. I was so surprised that when almost hotel in Singapore raised their rate this period, South East Asia still had the rate exactly as what they informed in their official site. So, I decided to stay there in 6 nights. Because I hadn't made any reservation before, I had to transfer room after each night. But it was not a serious problem, I was still happy to stay there with the cost of 80 SGD per night for a standard room and 90 SGD for superior room (same price for 1 and 2 persons). Moreover, I had the chance to discover some kinds of their room. For standaed room, it's really big if we consider it with some other budget hotels. Bathroom is also big enough without a bath-tub and is definitely clear. The annoyance is that they did not have mini-bar inside the room. Luckily, I didn't intend to use mini-bar so it didn't matter after all. Superior room is better, it's bigger and do have a mini-bar inside the room. There were not much noise at night, I spent all my nights there quietly and did have some good dreams. And guess what? You do not need to worry about your breakfast when staying South East Asia hotel 'coz they offer breakfast every morning, but it's all vegetarian food including rice, noodle and dumpling. Yeah, they do have a vegetarian restaurant there, too. If you wanna try a dish, I suggest \"sweet and sour fried fish\", it's absolutely delicious. Furthermore, the staffs are very friendly and useful. However, there were some annoyances that I can list as below. _ First, you can't bring room key along with you whenever you travel outside the hotel. You are suggested leaving them to the staffs and then, asking them whenever you return. _ Second, South East Asia hotel only accept the cash-only method of payment, they don't allow guests pay by their credit card or cheque or some thing like that. And you MUST pay daily, I mean, each night, you'll be asked to pay for your staying that night. It's all about the facilities and staff. Now, I'd like to mention about the location. SEA hotel locate in a pretty great location. Just 3 minutes walk, you can reach Bugis MRT station (East West line), or you can walk for about 5-7 minutes to reach Dhoby Ghaut MRT station connecting both North-South line and North-East line. There's also a food center just opposite to the hotel, but it's not very clean. And well, the biggest street shopping with many cheap price stuffs is right at the area, too. In conclusion, in my next travel to Singapore, I'll surely stay with SEA hotel again.

All calls and reservations was done promptly and email was replied fast as well with extra info such as how to go to the hotel by Taxi or the MRT. My personal experience is that the hotel is very convenient as it is very close to Bugis MRT station (3 minutes walk) and near to a Chinese food court which the food is selling cheap and nice and variety as well for local. Beside that the Bugis Street is a great place for cheap market shopping on cloths, fruits, souvenirs and many more. Ok back to the hotel, the AC is working fine even some other traveler complaint old and need replacement (I personally hard to adjust the temp and also the fan level as the AC is placed high up in the wall). Please bear in mind that this is a budget hotel and if the AC is working fine that would be good enough for me. The room is clean and the toilet is small but clean. Regarding the construction site beside the hotel is unavoidable as this is totally out hotel management control, I just close the window and the noise had reduced to my acceptable level. The constructions activities only happen during daytime so don\u2019t worry at night as you will have peaceful sleep. The room rate for my Double Bed standard room is 80 SGD with simple breakfast which is value for money especially in Singapore there is no such thing as cheap and nice hotels. Regarding the breakfast, it really complimentary so doesn\u2019t expect American style buffet breakfast. They basically provide a simple Chinese vegetarians fried noodle, fried rice and some buns or some bread toast with orange juice or coffee. If the breakfast portion does not satisfied you or you don\u2019t like the food you can always go to near by MC Donald. As an overall, this Hotel is worth the money you paid for especially in Singapore and with the clean room and good service at the counter and convenient location, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone which is on budget trip. One of the down sides is the Hotel only accept cash payment and don't accept credit card. So please prepare extra cash.
