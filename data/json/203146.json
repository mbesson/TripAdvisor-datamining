I think we paid around \u00a3420 for our 3 night stay here and believed we had secured ourselves a relative bargain. This was absolutely not the case. The price we paid as a Top Secret hotel was too much and I would have been even more indignant about the quality of accommodation on offer had we paid any more. The hotel is trying to appear elegant and charming. It is not. It is tired and in need of renovation that befits the character that the hotel has. The quality of the bedding was poor. The bed consisting of 2 slightly larger single mattress leaving an ever widening chasm for one of the beds occupants to occupy partially or fully throughout the course of the night. The duvet appeared to be a very thin low quality synthetic duvet that had been loosely sandwiched between 2 unfitted sheets. Totally unacceptable in a hotel that thinks of itself as high enough quality to be listed as \"Top Secret\". I need to iron some clothes after my journey and went to use the iron. There wasn't one, so I phoned for an iron and board from reception. That was not option either but I was entitled to pay for my ironing to be done within the half hour for a fee of \u20ac12 per shirt. No thanks. In fairness, the bathroom was nice (although the shower had a nasty habit of spraying half of its delivery on to the ceiling) and the breakfast included in the price was also pretty good. Additionally, the location of hotel is very good. But I'm not sure that this compensates for an exceedingly average interior. Luckily, Romes more obvious charms, friendly people and fantastic eateries made our frankly disappointing stay a very minor negative in an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable trip.

The 5 star rating which this hotel claims, is, in our opinion, an extreme exaggeration. We stayed here having booked a tailor made multi-centre holiday, so we had already stayed at 4 star hotels in two other Italian cities. At the Hotel d'Inghilterra the supposedly upgraded room turned out to be poorly lit perhaps to disguise the shabby and grubby furnishings. In addition a broken chandelier fitting left one arm of the chandelier hanging by a single electrical wire. Given our lack of experience of Rome hotels we decided to persevere. However, the next morning, we discovered that although provided with a fully working plug the sink was incapable of holding any water. The shambles that faced us at breakfast where cutlery and crockery in use was cleared away twice, whilst we were at the breakfast buffet, and where you had to ask for the toaster to be turned on somewhere in the next- door kitchen every time you wanted to make toast, confirmed our suspicions that selecting this hotel was a serious mistake. On complaining we were told that the problems in the room would be resolved by the time we returned to the hotel in the mid afternoon. When we returned we were informed that they could not rectify the problems and were asked if we would like to view an alternative room. Since the problems with the hotel were not just with regards to the room, we declined their offer and checked out, even though we had paid in advance for our four night stay.

The problem is that those stores can be found anywhere in the world. The main attraction is then the Spanish Steps. You can walk your way around Rome from there. That said, I am otherwise not impressed with the hotel being rated as a 5 star. I did not experience any unfriendly service as others have mentioned. The staff was actually very friendly and helpful. BUT, the rooms are extremely expense, no breakfast included unless you have the higher priced room. If you don't, it's 29EUR for an english breakfast that was quiet plain to me. Another 18EUR/day for internet. Considering I had just stayed at two other 5 star hotels in Australia before this trip (also for work), this hotel felt like I was in a 2-3 hotel that was just over-priced. I am also told that the translation of the hotel's name is \"The English Hotel\". That's ironic when you come to Rome to see Italy. Perhaps the italians don't think so fondly of their Italian chains, because when I joked about being recommend an english hotel to my Italian customers they said next time I should stay at the \"Hotel D'Russo?\", which translates to \"Hotel of Russia\".

It all depends whether you are looking for a really nice room, or really great service. But the point is, at a supposedly five star hotel, you shouldn't have to choose between them. Our deluxe room was nicely decorated, had very modern conveniences, and was fairly spacious for a European hotel room. The shower was great (no problems with hot water as I had read about), there was a tv behind the mirror in the bathroom, the bed very comfortable, and A/C working just fine (I mention the thermostat because of past reviews complaining about it). Housekeeping kept the room very nice and did turn down service every day.... although they walked into our room without really knocking, which wasn't a huge deal, but just one small example of the unrefined service. Our biggest complaint about the room was the lack of tv channels. We watched CNN for 4 days straight. I realize no one goes to Rome to sit in the room watching tv, but we did go back to relax for a while every night before dinner, and watched tv while going to sleep, and there should have been more variety. Of course, you CAN get more channels..... if you are willing to pay 30 euros a day for satellite tv and internet access. It seems like a \"five star\" hotel should just include something like this and not make you feel like you are being nickel and dimed for something as basic as tv service. You can buy unlimited internet service in your room for 18 euros a day, or you can use the computer in the hotel lobby right next to the front desk where you still have to pay by the hour (and sit there looking like a concierge). Breakfast buffet was good, it included cereal, fruit, pastries, meats/cheese, scrambled eggs, etc. The biggest atrocity at this hotel is the service. The staff is just completely, unbelievably unfriendly and not helpful. When you walk into your hotel, you at least expect the doorman and front desk employees to say hi to you! We were completely ignored every single time we entered. We made dinner reservations through the concierge, but they don't confirm anything with you. I had requested a reservation for 8:00 somewhere, and didn't hear back from the concierge... finally at 7:45 I called the front desk to find out what happened and they said \"oh yeah, of course it's confirmed\"... at which point I had to have them reschedule for 8:30, since we hadn't left the hotel yet (assuming the reservation had not been made). I asked them to please reconfirm with me that they were still able to get the table for 8:30 and the concierge argued with me saying that I should just assume everything is confirmed and they don't need to call me back to tell me so. What kind of five star service is that? Unlike most previous posters who seem to have had issues with their rooms, we were happy with this hotel on the surface.... it's clearly in a good location and our room was very nice looking and clean. But it was among the most unfriendly service I have ever experienced at any level.... while being one of the most expensive rooms we have ever stayed in.

While the booking process (direct with hotel) was swift and attentive, and they offered a discount on their Junior Suite, when we arrived to the hotel we could not enter the room until 13h. They had advised, of course, that check-in time was 14h but I told them I would be arriving by 12h. A luxury hotel like this one boasts to be would have had the room ready with prior notice. The stay was brief, as I said, but enough to realize that what Hotel Inghilterra calls Junior Suite would be a bare Deluxe Room anywhere else in Europe - and I am used to smaller European-style rooms. Air conditioning was doubtful, the view of the room was clearly its best feature, with a small balcony where one could sit and have breakfast if the concierge would have cared to ask. Which brings me to the second fault I have with Inghilterra. The two young ladies in charge were efficient, kind, and seemed very capable of being in charge of everything. Why did we need the actual concierge in charge, who looked angry all the time and performed the coldest hotel welcome I have ever experienced? One wonders. Incidentally, that same man tried to bill me for the standard price of the room when I was doing the check out. I gently pointed out that there had been a special offer, he distractedy said \"Oh yes, yes\" and issued the correct final bill. Breakfast buffet was ok but nothing out of the ordinary. I guess Rome provides for most of the extraordinary, but one also expects a top-rate hotel to keep up with the city. Especially when paying for a Junior Suite!

It was on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel, was a reasonable size but the carpet was very marked and the bathroom was disappointing as the bath was cracked and all of the grouting was discoloured etc. The air con was very noisy as if it was very old. It did drown out the street noise though!! The bed was comfortable and I was relieved that at least that was good! We complained immediately but were told we could not have another room until the following day. The other room they eventually offered us was on the 5th floor with a balcony and although it was smaller, it was cleaner so we took it the next day. We had emailed the hotel in January to advise them we wanted this trip to be special due to our anniversary but it was plain to us that no one in the hotel knew it was and so we were disappointed by that. Even when we explained that we wanted a good room as we had booked for that, they were very non committal about which room they could offer! The 4th floor has absolutely amazing rooms and we never saw anyone come out of those rooms dispite asking if we could be moved in to one and being told the hotel was full! We think they keep them for show or for a really special guest so that they stay special rather than tired like most of the other rooms! The food was great, although expensive, but there again Rome is very expensive with the pound being so poor against the euro. We had a meal at the hotel for our anniversay and were happy with the quality of food and one waiter was great! We would say that the more you get used to the hotel and Rome the more you warm to the hotel! By the end of our stay (3 nights) we decided we would go back but would bargain hard with the hotel!! The beds were extremely comfortable and rooms on the 5th floor are very quiet and air con was good too. Shame that you don't even get complimentary water in your room though as coffee/tea/coke etc are 9 euro each! If you go to this hotel do not expect a typical 5 star as it isn't as smart as you would expect, but we have stayed in expensive hotels and not slept well due to uncomfortable beds so...! The location is second to none, but the standard of english spoken is generally poor so caused some problems. So a mixed bag really but generally good.

The front desk staff is snobby and tired and knows NOTHING of customer service, or even treating you with any dignity. They did little but stare back at us blankly and tell us, \"We do not know\" when we asked politely what a good place for dinner would, and they never gave us accurate directions and seemed to delight in our exhaustion when we would return hours later, still not able to find the landmark they had not been able to help us find, which any town fool could have lead us to in seconds. They were amused by our problems, which I would say is the first sign of mistreated employees. The waiters at the restaurant are old and bemused by the fact that two young women would even want to eat at this crap hole, and are obviously mistreated by the management and pass it on snydely to the guests, just like the front desk taught them. As if guests are not already insulted enough by the pot of tea that costs-12 Euros, which is the same pot of tea that we are given for free in the morning, with leftover cookies from the bar that are stale and few. The food at the restaurant was truly terrible, almost so disgusting it was inedible, and so expensive we could have paid a private Mercedes to take us to the best restaurant, (if we could have found it...) ordered two bottles of nice wine, ordered five courses and bought a cheap knock off purse off the street for less than the price of the vile dinner we had. We decided the steak on the plane coming over was better, but tasted strangely similar. And to top it off, they stole my jewelry case out of the room and even when I offered a cash reward and no questions asked, they still took no responsibility and refused to give it back. You can not trust these people at this hotel!!! Also, nothing is free. Not internet, they will not call to confirm a flight for you, no WAY! They will not call a restaurant to make a reservation, they will not find a tour guide to take you to the places they refuse to tell you how to get to...NOOOOooooo, that would be too much to ask this lame place.

He told us the bell man was lying when he said he ordered us a taxi and quoted us 40 Euros. Who knows, they are all in bed together...either way, the whole thing is a rip off and just sucked.

The bed and pillows were extremely comfy, and considering the location, the room was very quiet. BAD THINGS: Apart from one very cheery girl in reception, the staff were fairly surly. We had an expensive breakfast (once!) in the hotel restaurant. The food wasn't up to much - standard European buffet, and the attitude of the staff bordered on rude. My husband asked for a medium boiled egg, and when it arrived it was almost raw - he couldn't eat it at all.

I came earlier than her and wanted to make a surprise for her in the room. It was 11 am when I checked in. They advised to come later around noon time as the room was not ready. That is usual. I thought they would arrange the rooms if possible in a case like a honeymoon. I left my luggage and had a walk around. My girlfriend was gonna arrive around 12:30 pm and I get to the hotel at noon just before her. They apparently did not finish to prepare the room yet. I had to wait and I could not make that surprise to her in the room. I was at the lobby when she arrive to the Hotel. Their excuse was that their normal procedure was to check in at 2 pm and we were lucky that the previous guest left earlier. Must not this be something predictable for them at 11 am ? This was not a major issue of course, however some things were not so simple for us then. The room service was not very bright since we could not order anything to eat or drink at 2 am. The bar was closed and we could not get a wine except the selection of some drinks in the mini bar. There were no wine in minibar. The room was nice but the lights at the bedroom can not be turned off without turning the master switch which then turns the bathroom lights off as well. It was strange. We wanted to listen some music in the room but we had only few TV channels none of them is a music channel. There were pay channels, including the music. We were disappointed that we could not listen to music without paying extra. The next day we could not open the door as the old conventional key was not working. We phoned the room service twice, but it took like about 10 minutes for the technician to arrive and help us to get in the room, we were asked excuse to be at the bathroom. He was not speaking English and he sounded like as we were not potent enough to use the key properly. They did not attempt to fix the door lock. Therefore we had difficulty each time we entered the room. My girlfriend's hair curling machine plug did not fit into the outlet on the bathroom wall. We had to ask for an adaptor and they brought it immediately. When I called the room service couple of times from the number written on the brochure in the room, sometimes I had no answer. I had to call reception. Loundry service was good and reasonable. I had my shirt ironed for only 8 \u20ac. The last morning, at 8:55 am, our door was opened by the maid when I was at the bathroom and my girlfriend scared to be seen naked. After some time, the maid tried to open the door without knocking or ringing the bell for a second time. This is not desirable in such a Hotel. We left our luggages ready to take in the room ad spent time outside of the hotel until our flight time, after the check out. During the check out, they checked our minibar while we were waiting at the reception, since we were too drunk at the night that we did not remember our consumence. We asked a taxi from the reception but they advised us to ask it from the porter. At the door, we could not see any porter. We returned to the reception to ask where the porter is. Then they tried to find him. We standed outside waiting for them to get us a taxi. After some time, I had to go back and ask once again, where the person at the desk was there with the porter but they forgot to call our taxi. Later, we returned to the Hotel with the cab waiting to take our luggages. What we noticed is that they found our phone charger in the room and put it next to our bags. It was a nice gesture. Later, on the way to the airport, we realised that we forgot to take our champoo and hair balsam in the bathroom and also the pack of Italian cheese that we bought earlier and kept in the minibar. Basically they thought that we left them on purpose for trash. However, I would expect them to warn us about those as they checked the minibar and started to clean the entire room before we left. When we paid the extras, I noticed that they charged 24 \u20ac for a local telephone call about 1-2 minutes only. This was not reasonable at all. We did not complain about it as we already paid quite a lot for the minibar already. This Hotel is a five star one, but it is quite simple central Hotel with a classical ancient look and furniture. Do not expect a swimming pool, nor other facilities like a fitness center, sauna, solarium, desk for travel agent, convenient stores in large lobby, 24 hours open bar and room service etc... You can not find those in there.... Enjoy very cool costumes of the reception clerk and their noble respect in the most high society street of Roma...

And, as with our initial concerns about the Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria in Sorrento based on previous reviews, I had some misgivings about this choice. As with Excelsior Vittoria, my fears were quickly dispelled when we were shown to our room - almost like a little suite with separate sleeping area, nicely decorated with a small, but lovely bathroom with tub/shower combination. The bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of windows . Housekeeping came twice daily, and turndown service included chocolates and the next day's weather forecast. Plush robes and slippers were provided. Our package included a buffet breakfast in the hotel's cozy restaurant where you can eat indoors or out - cereals, yogurt, breads, meats, cheeses, pastries, fruit, eggs and bacon, as well as tickets to the Borghese Gallery (highly recommended). Each evening we returned to find some sort of treat in our room. The hotel is nicely decorated, with several intimate seating areas. We found the restaurant staff cordial and the bellmen solicitious. The concierges and front desk staff truly shined. Everyone seemed to know our names from the beginning. All were extremely gracious, attentive, helpful and seemed to care about their guests. The location is terrific - in the heart of Rome's most fashionable shopping district, a block from the Spanish Steps, very close to the Trevi Fountain, walking distance to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, ancient Rome. We found the hotel to be a welcome oasis of calm at the end of our busy days. It is not cheap. But our stay at the d'Inghilterra definitely contributed to a wonderful first visit to Rome.", "Date": "October 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cRipOff\u201d", "Author": "paintsflowers", "ReviewID": "UR5894631", "Content": "First of all, I will not use Hotels.com to ever book any hotel. we arrived here knowing that we had paid for Superior rooms and ended up with standard ones. This was my first trip to Italy and all I could think of was a wonderful view from my room. Not so as I opened the shutters to view a steel pipe. I requested another room, which had a view of another building across the narrow street. I hated to be a complainer, so I settled on this smaller room. Found out later that I overpaid quite a bit for a lesser room. At first the staff was stiff, but seemed better as time went on. The food is so expensive. Imagine 6 Euros for a bottle of water? I had a bowl of clear broth for 24Euros. Breakfast was supposed to be included orginially (I blame Hotels.com for that). They screwed up this whole deal. Maid service was excellent (2x a day), but would I stay here again? Only if they gave it to me for half price. I have to say that the doorman was quite nice and very attentive.

In particular, the rooms are just not good enough for the price, and the staff seem under instruction to lowball the room as much as possible. We arrived and had to wait as a group of two couples checking out were complaining about how inadequate their room arrangments were. We were left waiting for about 30 minutes whilst this went in circles. We were then shown to a room which was ridiculous for the rate we were paying, and contrary to what we had requested upon booking. We were then offered another - again, not good enough. The third room was better, but still by far the smallest and poorest equipped room we had on a 3 week euro tour. But, we had been travelling for 5 hours, and just wanted to get moving. The doorman to be fair had no problem moving us each time we said the room wasnt up to scratch, but in a weird way that only made me feel more taken advantage of, in that we were not offered the best available room for the rate from the beginning. Two mornings later at breakfast I heard anotehr couple at reception calmly stating their room was not good enough either ... frankly the staff are being given a hard deal here, as they need to defend the indefensible. They do it with good grace, not rudeness, other than in the case of the head concierge who we found patronising, but the hotel is overcharging. Also, we arrived 30 June. The Head Concierge could not inform us of what concerts were on through Rome for the next 3 nights, as the guide book they used expired 30 June and they didnt have anything else to refer to. We made our own arrangements, but, really, not good enough, especially as we had emailed ahead of time asking for suggestions and nothing was offered other than for the first night (referencing the guide book for 30 June). The room was cramped and decor not as plush as we have enjoyed elsewhere for less. The room blacked out, for no good reason, on the second night. The bathroom scales did not work and toiletries were missing. All little things, but they dont happen at better places, and the hotel holds itself out as 5 star. This area we loved and would definately return to; but we would stay elsewhere.", "Date": "July 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the money\u201d", "Author": "Philleas_Fogg_uette", "ReviewID": "UR5343231", "Content": "The best thing about this hotel is its fabulous location in the very heart of Rome, 1 minute from the Spanish Steps and Rome's luxury shopping. However its other features, and especially the service, do not justify its price. My husband and I arrived at the hotel at around 10.00 pm for a one night's stay in a Superior room (costing 590 Euros with breakfast). Check-in was fast and after that we were led to a first floor room by the bell-boy. The bell-boy got us crammed in a tiny elevator together with our luggage (not a five star treatment at all!). The room was quite nice and comfortable, but certainly not worth the price. The bed was very good and the linen high quality, but we noticed several stains on the carpet, covered up by various rugs and mats. Furthermore, the TV (a large flat screen one) was sitting on top of a small desk, so no workspace at all for writing. There was one armchair and one chair in the room and no coffee table. The bathroom was fitted with stunning Italian marble and had natural light, but it was quite small and we had to jump over the bidet to get into the bathtub. The bathroom amenities were cheap stuff and actually the shower cup and the vanity set boxes were empty. Also there was nothing complementary in the room when we arrived (not even a bottle of water), and for us this was very bizarre given that we had booked directly with the hotel and were paying a great deal of cash for less that a ten hour stay. Anyway, we had a good sleep and the room was quiet, but that was the least we expected. Breakfast was OK but not great, and pesonally I was amazed at the fact that the waitress ignored us all along. Upon leaving the concierge help us sort out a problem with our rail tickets in a very short notice, and this was the only moment of our stay when we felt we got good service. Overall, we did not hate this hotel but we were not very happy with it either.

We did upgrade to a Junior Suite but what we were given I would rate as a full Suite. We had a spacious sitting room with seperate bedroom, linked by large double doors. We also had a large bathroom. I was delighted with our suite which was furnished with some fine antiques, a couple of pieces I coveted for my own home. I feel it is worth upgrading when staying in older hotels in Italian cities for the space provided. Although we do not plan to spend an inordinate amount of time in the room, I do enjoy having a sitting area to relax in. Excellent fabrics, linens, pillows & such a comfortable bed. Quirking plumbing though but hey, you're in Italy, it's usual! We did not eat in the hotel (other than breakfast which was very good) as we are familiar with Rome & have our prefered restaurants there. We found staff to be so helpful & our experience differed totally from last reviewer although we may have been there at the same time. We were prepared with restaurant bookings for every night but one which, due to our own inertia & indecision, meant we reached 7.30pm with nowhere to eat on a busy Friday night in Rome! No problem, concierge sorted us out & got a last minute table at an excellent restaurant nearly. Nothing was too much trouble for the people on the front desk, they are charming. The location of this hotel is excellent, not just for the shopping nearby, but only a modest walk to most things you are likely to want to see, including the Vatican. For longer distances, Spagna metro station is only a few steps away. The price I was quoted for a standard room was, by my experiences of Rome & given the standard & location of the hotel, cheap. I did peep into some of those rooms & whilst they looked beautifully decorated I prefer more space. For me the upgrade was worth it & when we return we will do so again.

The room was quite noisy from activity on the street below, which continued into the late evening. Staff were snooty and unresponsive. Lunch service in the restaurant moved at glacial speed -- we almost spent our entire trip waiting for the waiter to return to our table. The food was good, but not spectacular. We had difficulty arranging a dinner reservation at an outside restaurant because the concierge does not work on weekends! I guess they don't expect people to eat out on Saturday night. We asked the desk an hour in advance to get us a taxi, and when we arrived downstairs -- no surprise here -- there was no taxi. It was clear that they had never called for one, because one came in 20 minutes after they did place the call. We stood outside waiting for the cab that should have already been there, and then the doorman had the audacity to look at me for a tip when he opened the door for me! Next time, I will stay at one of Rome's other fine hotels for 100 Euros less, and take that 10 Euro taxi ride to the Steps.

The rooms were big, spacious and very clean and the marble bathroom is sheer opulence. The breakfasts were hearty and filling and certainly set you up for a day of sightseeing.
