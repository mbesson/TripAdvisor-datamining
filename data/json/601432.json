I have been to Rome at least 25 times. This trip was just my daughter (18th birthday trip) and me. I wanted something a little different and not as expensive as the places I normally stay. My friend suggested Portrait Suites-- I was very nervous to try something new! The ONLY negative was the taxi driver who picked us up at the train station in Rome- He refused to drop us directly in front of the hotel. His response when i gave him the address was, \"not possible, madam--too many people. I cannot drive there.\" We walked 2 blocks--which was annoying but fine. For future visits--either pre arrange with the hotel for a pick up or find a taxi driver not as difficult and temperamental as the one we had :) Upon arrival at the hotel--which is perfectly located Via Bocca De Leone (directly off of Via Del Condotti)-- we were greeted by the duo of the charming and professional Roberto and Thomas. After they showed us the beautiful hotel lobby, we were shown to our amazing duplex suite-- This is the type of room one sees in Architectural Digest! The bathroom was complete with a sauna, exercise bike, two beautiful marble sinks, separate bath and shower. The wood paneling was breathtaking--I would want it for my house! This hotel truly felt as though we were guests in a close friend's exquisite mansion. The attention to detail was everywhere in both design and service. The breakfast was delivered to our room on time and it was exactly as we asked. The hotel has a beautiful rooftop garden/terrace but the weather was a rainy in the morning. Roberto and Thomas made all of our dinner reservations--they didn't mind when we made several last minute changes:) In addition to the warm and hospitable nature of the hotel management--they went out of their way to accommodate me with some gluten free items I wanted to bring back home. Roberto went to the celiac store outside of the city and brought three huge boxes back to the hotel for me. It's expensive but I plan to stay at Portrait Suites when I return to Rome this summer, no need to stay any where else! --Perfecto! www.glutenfreeguy.com", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute Perfection\u201d", "Author": "Deb P", "ReviewID": "UR128128737", "Content": "When my husband and I prepare to travel I wind up spending hours researching hotels, trying to find the perfect place for us to call home on our journey. As usual I found several top-end hotels to explore and, also typically, my husband winced at the thought of paying their rates. When pushed to explain myself regarding my desire to stay in such expensive hotels I paused and said, \"for me the hotel sets the tone for the trip.\" He couldn't argue with that. We had narrowed it down to two hotels: The Portrait Suites and another near by. There was something in the reviews, pictures, and descriptions of the Portrait Suites that kept pulling me in. I knew it's aesthetics were appealing to me and when the rates of the other hotel went up we booked our reservation at the Portrait Suites and I did a little happy dance. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the on staff manager, given a tour, taken to the terrace, and shown to our room. The decor and amenities in the room were just right. The Portrait Suites is a hotel for today-they provide each room with an iPad that's been loaded with lists of restaurants that the staff has personally been to & they provide a charging station for all of your personal gadgets. Great shower. Comfortable bed. Yummy pillows. Tiny kitchen tucked into a cabinet. The hotel is situated in the center of an exceptionally busy and high-end shopping district 1 block from the base of the Spanish Steps. With the windows shut silence was all we heard. The next morning we had our first breakfast on the roof top terrace. Wow! Now granted the weather was amazing but the terrace and the views from it were breathtaking. It was a little piece of paradise set amidst an absolutely beautiful backdrop of Rome. The food was great and the service impeccable. We took advantage of the terrace every evening, too-cocktails on the roof before dinner was a great way to cap our day. We spoke with the manager about our plans for the day and asked for suggestions for dinner. He made some notes and hooked us up with a great neighborhood Trattoria that night. This same scene was played out over the next 4 days and each suggestion hit the mark. I had expected the hotel and room to be fabulous but I hadn't given much thought to the hotel staff. Without a doubt the entire staff made our stay the exceptional experience that it was. Each and every person that worked at the Portrait Suites was helpful, positive, solicitous yet unobtrusive. I can't thank them enough. We spent three weeks in Italy and stayed in some amazing hotels. Without a doubt our favorite was the Portrait suites. If you have the chance to stay there do it.

With so few rooms the staff is correspondingly small and by the second day you know all of them and they know you. My wife was quite shocked when we stopped by the small reception room one morning to ask about a dinner reservation that evening and she was greeted with \"Happy Birthday\" (which they'd picked up from her passport). When we returned that evening (from a great restaurant they'd gotten us a reservation at) there was a card and bottle of wine waiting for her, and a short time later one of the staff brought us a bottle of champagne. They also took care of tours and transportation setup so smoothly that it was like having a personal assistant. Your breakfast is either brought to your room or meets you at their rooftop terrace. Breakfast on the terrace is something not to be missed! Overall I'd say this is the first luxury hotel we've stayed in where the service and experience really was worth the extra you pay versus a similar room a typical chain hotel.

The hotel does not look like a hotel in our tradition understating....but like a residential house...the entrance with a little sign plate \"Portrait Suit\", the door is always closed so you need to call a bell and a staff will immediately take the stairs down and open it. There is no reception hall and the reception desk situated on the 1-st floor looks like a living room....with table, chairs, TV, a console table with beverages for the guests. The room was clean and quiet made in classical minimalism style. The bathroom is also spacious and very clean. There was also a little kitchenette in the room....with all necessary equipment: cooktop, kettle, coffeemaker, microwave, dishwasher etc. But the most excellent place in that hotel is the splendid roof terrace overlooking the Rome...with a fireplace, deck-chairs, tables and a little room where you can choose any beverage you want by your yourself. Portrait Suites offers free Wi-Fi, garage service, bar, continental breakfast served in the studio/suite or outdoor on the rooftop terrace and much more. A special thanks to the excellent staff!

It was selected largely due to very favourable reviews on this website. I have been fortunate to travel to Rome several times over the last few years. And overall the hotel is stylish, pleasant and has many great features but it is far from perfect. It certainly stacks up very poorly when compared to the Villa Spalletti Trivelli and probably fits in better when compared to the Villa Laetitia owned by the other shoemaker Fendi. First the suite is poorly designed (isnt Ferragamo all about design?) We were 3 people. The \"sitting room\" held the second bed. The bathroom was off the bedroom forcing our 3rd person to walk through the bedroom whenever the bathroom was necessary. Not acceptable at this price. The bed was broken and sagged badly. A plastic frame held slats. The plastic was marred and the slats could not be reinstalled. Attempts to fix this had obviously been made many times as the plastic was badly worn. Just poor quality. We realised this as we were leaving and when we mentioned it on leaving this was greeted with a shrug. The bathroom was beautiful and mostly functional. My female travelling mates really liked the Ferragamo products offered. But both of them expressed surprise at the very poor quality toilet paper and tissue. A built in cabinet housing the \"kitchen\" was very well appointed but it had to be wedged shut at night to turn the lights out. Breakfast is offered by a form which you fill in and and hang on your door at night. The first night we were there the hotel \"forgot\" to provide this. So no breakfast. Also, we found out when we finally did get this form the second night, anything beyond coffee, juice and a croissant was \"extra\". The in room safe swallowed our passports and needed the staff to reopen it. A \"design problem\" we were told. The hotel has a great location. Unfortunately Via Codotti is a very busy street and the room, even with shutters/windows closed and drapes drawn, was very noisy. Others who mentioned that this is their \"best hotel experience ever\" certainly either had a very different experience than we did or haven't travelled very much. By far the most important though was the fact that the hotel stole money from us. We booked through a well known online agency (Booking.com). Two nights for three people in a suite. This for about 500 Euros/night. When we arrived the desk guy claimed that our reservation was for 2 people. We unfortunately did not have a hard copy of our reservation with us but after he made some phone calls and lots of whining he agreed to give us a \"free upgrade\" to a 3 person suite. This was a little bit astonishing to us since this is exactly what we had booked. All seemed fine, other than the previously mentioned issues, until we checked out. My wife was presented with a bill that was fully 300 Euros (30%) more than the rate agreed to in writing at booking. The explanation was \"breakfast charges\" for a breakfast that we were never served also a \"tax\" of over 100 Euros. Blah blah. Theft! We've booked dozens of hotel rooms online. Prices include tax and in this case breakfast was specifically included in writing. And we have never had a hotel welch on their agreed on price until last weekend.

We spent morning, afternoons, evenings on the roof. Basically, whenever we needed a break. I never got tired of enjoying the views from the deck. More on that later. On to the more routine details. We stayed for six nights in September. Unfortunately our flight was delayed and we did not arrive at the hotel until close to 2 am. And yet there were two, not one but two, people waiting to greet us. In fact, they were out on the street looking for our car. It was wonderful to be so well taken care of even at such a late hour. We had booked the most basic room category (we were in 213). It was adequate for our needs but it was not a particularly large room. There is a small but very well equipped kitchenette complete with fridge, dishwasher, microwave, stove, coffee maker, etc., including dishes, silverware, glasses. Realistically, you could actually prepare a meal, though I wasn\u2019t sure how anyone would use the burners given that I found no pots or pans. Having the fridge and the coffee/tea maker was a great perk and we used both throughout our stay. My biggest complaint about the room was the bathroom. We found it to be very small. We also didn\u2019t love the fact that the closet/dressing area was across the room from the bathroom. Given how small the bathroom was we couldn\u2019t keep all of our things in the bath and it was irritating at times to have to trek back and forth. But again, the room was small so it was not a huge issue. I am sure that most hotels in central Rome are not much more (if any more) spacious. As others have noted, this is a boutique hotel so there is no restaurant, spa, etc. If you are looking for a full service hotel, this may not be the place for you. But again, there is the amazing and fabulous roof deck. I really can\u2019t say too much about it. You can see many of the sights from up there and you get to see them at different times of days in different lights. Just watching the comings and goings at the Spanish Steps right down the street is great entertainment. There is an honor bar on the roof deck but to be honest, that label really doesn\u2019t do it justice. It really is an extremely well outfitted bar/kitchen with every type of alcohol and beverage you can imagine as well as an espresso maker, a beer tap and ice machine. You can either help yourself or the staff is happy to make a drink for you. One corner of the deck has a fireplace which is nice in the late evenings. Breakfast is included and though it may not be a full hot breakfast, it does include coffee/tea, juice, milk, cereal, yogurt, bread choices (including decadent nutella filled croissants), etc. If that isn\u2019t enough, you can easily add on eggs, omelets, cheeses, meats, etc. They leave the breakfast menu in your room each day and you just fill it out and leave it on your door before you go to bed. You can even choose to eat in your room or on the amazing deck. The hotel staff was very helpful. Roberto gave us some recommendations as to sights, including the Basilica San Clemente (in honor of our home city here in California!). We enjoyed what he recommended and appreciated his insights. Our only notable issue was one someone previously raised. The hotel arranged an airport pickup for us which was very convenient especially given how late we arrived. However, the fee for that service could not be charged to our room and had to be paid separately to the Concierge service (apparently not the same company) prior to departure. We were not advised of this until 9 pm the night before our departure (and of course I didn\u2019t remember the prior post until then). Luckily we had sufficient cash to pay the amount, but if you are using the Concierge for any paid services, make sure to clarify what will go on your room bill and what won\u2019t. This is a definite area for improvement. All in all, if we return to Rome, we will definitely return to the Portrait Suites. It is a beautiful, modern hotel that is just about as well located as you can get. The rooms an common areas are beautifully decorated. We will book a larger room next time though. Final note: don\u2019t forget the 10% discount at the Ferragamo stores that you get when you stay here!", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Place to Stay in Rome\u201d", "Author": "IrishCal", "ReviewID": "UR118759717", "Content": "Just spent four nights at the Portrait Suites in Rome.

I strongly recommend the hotel. We had two rooms \u2013 a Studio Deluxe and a Superior Studio. With our son now nearly six foot tall, we spared him the indignity of a sleeper sofa or cot by getting him his own room. Our room, the Studio Deluxe, was slightly larger than the Superior Studio. The main difference was that we had room for a sofa, two easy chairs, a coffee table and a desk and chair, while our son\u2019s Superior Studio simply had two easy chairs and a coffee table. We also had a walk through dressing area, with more space for our things (our son\u2019s dressing areas and closet was more galley-like). Otherwise, the rooms were essentially the same. The furnishings were modern, yet comfortable. The bedding was very comfortable, and the linens and towels of highest qualify. Both bathrooms had a separate tub and shower \u2013 but only one sink. Both rooms also had a kitchenette area (including a dishwasher, small fridge and espresso maker). Lighting was very good in all seating areas and in the reading areas of the bed. The HVAC worked very well (see note below). When the windows were closed, the rooms were extremely quiet. All told, the physical setting and arrangement of the rooms was perfectly lovely. What set the hotel apart, however, were (i) the attentiveness of the staff and (ii) the lovely rooftop terrace. Since this is a very small hotel (only 14 rooms, and we had 2 of them), the staff offers personal attention to all of the guests. Fluent English was on offer, and the staff more than went out of their way to help with dinner reservations, touring assistance and general observations regarding how we could improve our stay in Rome. Moreover, the staff seemed genuinely pleased to see us, and greeted us warmly on each occasion. Bravo. The rooftop terrace \u2013 which was more than usable in late March \u2013 is glorious, with terrific views of the Spanish Steps and of Rome in general. The seating is most comfortable, and there is plenty of it. Moreover, an honor bar provides the opportunity for refreshment (and free espresso!). Breakfast was good. We had it in our room some of the morning since it was a tad cold for the rooftop. It was better on the rooftop. A few other observations: - this is a very secure hotel, since the only way in is to buzz for admittance, and that is done by the staff in person. - the setting, on the Via Condotti, above the Ferragamo men\u2019s store, is very attractive. There is pedestrian traffic, and some vehicular traffic. Our window looked out on the Brioni store (window shopping only for me). - the hotel is very automated. Generally, that\u2019s great. But one night the system had to be reset, which caused the air conditioning to be turned off accidentally. That led to a somewhat warm room by morning. - the hotel had Roma Passes available for us. That was great \u2013 we didn\u2019t have to go looking for them. They also arranged a transfer back to the airport for us. Again, great. What came as a surprise was a note the night before we checked out asking that we pay for both of these in cash, instead of with a credit card. Not a problem in general, but by the night before checkout I had kept only the cash I needed in order to pay tips at the hotel and buy some food at the airport. So, the tip money went to covering the Roma Pass and transfer. - Our room had only one window. That left it a tad dark, especially when factoring in that it was on the third floor. Our son\u2019s room had two windows, and was on the fourth floor \u2013 and thus had more natural light. If you like natural light, opt for a higher floor. This is very fine small hotel. I would come back here in an instant.

Spacious, stylish, LCD TVs, kitchenette (even w/ small dish washer), walk in type closet, nice bathroom with nice sized shower, and the pillows, sheets and towels were excellent...and free wifi too.

We were welcomed warmly and offered drinks and a comfortable seat while being checked in. Roberto was introduced and provided an unparalleled introduction to our room and the hotel, including the fantastic terrace! Our room was the deluxe studio which was stylish, roomy, and comfortable. The decor was modern and top-notch. I would rate this above the Four Seasons I've stayed at in North America. The bathroom was outfitted beautifully and we enjoyed the radiant heated floors and rain showerhead. We enjoyed the attention to detail provided by every staff member -- they were always attentive, friendly, and professional. Gianluca provided recommendations on restaurants based on our tastes and reservations were always made for us without delay. We sampled fine seafood at Mare, more typical Roman fare at da Pietro, and had an excellent birthday meal at the trendy and busy Pastificio San Lorenzo! A highlight of the hotel is rooftop terrace. Great views of the Tridente district and Spanish Steps and above the high-end shopping district directly below. There is a well-stocked self-serve \"honour\" bar which we enjoyed nightly while watching the sunset. The excellent breakfast can also be served on the terrace, something we took advantage of each morning. The hotel is located within a stone's throw to the Spanish Steps and the Spagna metro station. Many restaurants, shops, and historic sites are within walking distance. We ran to and through the Villa Borghese in the morning, walked to the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and many Piazzas.

It was so hard to leave you ! We added 4 days in Rome after to a trip to see friends further South to kick off our 30th wedding anniversary . Our last trip there was 10 years prior with our then younger sons, and while a wonderful vacation for a family , the thought a more romantic Rome experience ( and accommodation) called to us. Certain we wanted to stay someplace that the accommodation was well located and well designed was important (my husband is an architect) and scale ( a place that offered a more intimate experience) seemed in order. After reading posts on various sites, my first choice was Portrait Suites. The truth is that we were not strangers to the Ferragamo touch as we had visited Il Boro , and sensed that this hotel would likely live up to its high internet marks. After a few emails back and forth to confirm our accommodations, the information began to flow. I had mentioned wanting a special Valentine's Day dinner and soon received a 14 page list of dining suggestions from one of the staff members. Upon arrival we were greeted by the warm and welcoming staff. Luggage was whisked away and we were offered a welcome treat and beverage. Roberto , impeccable and knowledgeable - carefully noted what we hoped to accomplish on this visit. His in-depth knowledge provided us with off beat things to see and do that weren't typical to the guide books. Example-My desire, as a serious cook, was to eat in restaurants where the food would be amazing. As any foodie knows, that does not always mean the most expensive restaurant or those with with a view - so commonly the destination of tourists on vacation. Our dinners were at the tables of the bright and sparkling new chefs who are invigorating the cuisine of Rome with excitement and innovation. Roberto chose restaurants that had style, energy and inventive cuisine. He even planned which one would be best for St. Valentines day- aware that the walk back to Portrait would take us through a stunning park with broad views to the old city , and where lovers (young and old) walked or sat holding hands with the lights of Rome before them. Now this is a concierge who knows his city! The hotel? In a word- impeccable. From entry to interior details, art , finishes and ambiance, its townhouse-like space provides intimacy and charm that larger hotels cannot. At Portrait it was as if you were coming home to your own in- town flat where your 'staff' warmly greeted you anytime of day or night. From the stunning rooftop terrace with fireplace to sexy suite, no detail has been overlooked. Our gorgeous room was restful and generous. From the sumptuous bed to the many thoughtful touches like a nightly bottle of water at your bedside- along with your slippers , a cozy throw ( that I adored), incredible Ferragamo toiletries, massive dressing mirrors and a tiny (but well outfitted) kitchenette. Clearly not one single detail was overlooked in the design of this hotel. Would we recommend Portrait Suites ? Si, si, si ! We plan to return to the wonderful place again knowing we have found friends in the warm and polished staff, and paradise in the modern yet inviting interior along with it's spectacular location. Every morning and evening we enjoyed the roof terrace where the skyline of Roma - her arms wide open to lovers and travelers of all ages for centuries - as our home. This is more than a hotel. It is a place of history, of romance and where dreams do come true. tThe Portrait suites simply sets a bar that other hotels should learn from and should strive to achieve. A 10 on on 10 scale.

Basically you have to ring the bell and the receptionist comes to open the door for you. There is no restaurant but you can order limited room service if you feel craving at night. The breakfast is served in your room in the morning, which is limited but tasty, and feels good if you like to eat your breakfast in bed. We stayed in a junior suite which was very tastefully decorated with two flat screen tvs and a kitchenette in the living room area. There is not bathtub in the bathroom but a shower, so if you must have a bubble bath after walking all around Rome to relax, you must be careful. In the room there is dvd and ipod player, and you can take out dvds from the hotels reception. The hotel staff is very helpful and knowledgeable, and they recommend great restaurants that are known mostly to Italians. We quite liked the fact that this is a very small boutique hotel and you dont have to meet a million people when you are in and out of the hotel but you can come in and out as if it is your house. However, it was winter when we were there but in summer one may require more space or gardens to chill out. There is a lovely roof terrace where they could also serve food, but it was rainy during our stay so we could not use it. I would recommend this hotel for a long weekend for couples, without kids as there is not even a corridor for kids to run around but stairs..", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel in Rome period.\u201d", "Author": "BAJZK", "ReviewID": "UR54080855", "Content": "If you're hesitating between portrait suites and another hotel- quit wasting your time and book portrait now!

Being a picky traveller that has been quite a few places, looked at many many hotels in Rome, found it hard to find a good hotel that met my standards, drawing comparisons to other design/boutique hotels in other large cities. Then stumbled on to Portrait Suites and although somewhat expensive (all hotels in Rome seem expensive...), did not regret this choice for one second. The room had a very good size, we had our own balcony (next to the Penthouse suite, only a limited amount of rooms seem to have one). Bathroom was nice, contemporary design, nothing too flashy, just the way it should be, separate shower/bath tub. Location is fantastic, a small side street to Via Condotti, we had a view over the Spanish Steps from the room (200 meters away), with walking distance to lots of good restaurants. What really sets this hotel apart is two things: 1) Personal service. I have never experienced such personal service, the staff took a personal interest in you and could spend hours finding the right restaurant (at last, we made up our mind ;-)). I have stayed at various 4/5 star properties and albeit service in general is good and can be overwhelming in some places, I really felt that this service was more personal and not just service as a concept. 2) This has to do with #1, but since the hotel is small with a limited amount of rooms, it feels very very cozy and again, that personal detail to everything.

Also, check out the nearby restaurant Palatium, focused on wines and foods of the Lazio region around Rome - very tasty, and a mostly young Italian clientele (at least the night I visited).", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, elegant and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "minniemouse", "ReviewID": "UR8408089", "Content": "We stayed at Portrait Suites last week. We were very happy with the room. It's beautifully decorated, very quiet and comfortable. We were surprised to find that our suite included a tiny kitchen, complete with dishes and silverware, a two burner stove and microwave, dishwaasher and an espresso maker. We didn't do any cooking, but the espresso maker was very nice and the refrigerator/minibar was roomy. The bathroom was great with a giant showerhead, great towels, and very nice bathroom amenities. The closet was roomy enough for lots of clothes, there was a table for breakfast and a desk and a big flat panel hd tv. The only problem I encountered involved my pillow request. I had emailed ahead and asked them if they could provide a down pillow and they said they would. I reconfirmed but when we got there, there was no down pillow. I mentioned it to the manager and she said that all the pillows were down inside, which made no sense because I looked at the labels which read cotton/polyester. She graciously offered to buy me a down pillow. I really appreciated the effort, but it turned out that she purchased another cotton or poly pillow. I don't like to complain, so I didn't say anything again, but suffered a couple of migraines as a result. We ran into the manager on the last day and she asked about it and we discussed it. In spite of this, I think that the service and accommodations were excellent and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cRome's new reference: Portrait Suites and then when ur hungry: Ziro!!\u201d", "Author": "Nucc", "ReviewID": "UR7857641", "Content": "WOW!....

Had a fantastic meal at Target (recommended by concierge) on our first night. Our next meal at Rhome not so good, very pleasant waiter but unbelievably slow service and food nowhere near the standard of the Target restaurant and the night we ate there Rhome restaurant was showing the rematch between manchester united and Roma on two huge flat screens (we couldn't have picked a worse night!!) i think the kitchen staff were all watching the match and were in no hurry to serve a table of Brits!! Anyway the hotel was a great find, the rooftop terrace was beautiful but the drinks service up there was incredibly slow. We ordered a bottle of Frascati and it took over half an hour to arrive it didnt really matter because we were with another couple so we all sat chatting in the sunshine and when it arrived it was beautifully served on a lovely tray with crisps and nuts but it was a long wait and something that needs improvement ,a simple drinks menu on the rooftop would make things easier for the staff as they could have a fridge stocked and ready to serve. Also hubby ordered an internet connection (you say how long you want and they give you a print out with a code on it which you enter on your laptop etc )it seemed a bit of a complicated process and no one came to our room with the printout infact they handed it to him as we were leaving for dinner that evening (he had sat in the room waiting for it earlier!) Another tip would be to either book the hotel car to take you back to the airport or if you dont have much luggage just walk down to the spanish steps and grab a cab (they are always there) We asked the hotel to call us a cab and it took forever to come, we were beginning to worry we would miss our flight. However i have to say it was a lovely hotel all new and modern and very clean, the staff were really lovely and i am sure that when all the small hiccups are sorted out it will rival any of the top hotels in Rome (we sat one night drinking champagne in the bar at the Hassler and it seemed so old and musty compared to the Portrait Suites) When you check in they hand you a list of DVDs that are available to watch in your room (as only english speaking channels on TV are CNN and SKY news ) but the list is so dire i really dont know why they hand it out it is a big sheet of paper with about five films printed on it they all had a Rome theme i cant remember them all but Roman Holiday etc Not Gladiator, that should definately be on the list and i do think it wouldn't cost much to nip down the shop and put a few more decent blokbusters on the list. You do so much walking and eating in Rome its nice to go back to your beautiful room with huge flat screen tv and curl up and watch a movie. Anyway i only mention these small details because i am sure the hotel must check out its reviews and if they just improve on these small issues they will turn what is already a very good hotel into an excellent hotel. We had a fantastic time at the Portrait suites and i would not hesitate to stay here again", "Date": "April 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence-Italy", "Title": "\u201cCharming and confortable suites\u201d", "Author": "Elisa&Leo-ontheroad", "ReviewID": "UR6042849", "Content": "Just perfect!
