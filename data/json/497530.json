The lobby is large and the halls are very wide. Our room was nice with a balcony overlooking the pool. You are about an hour outside of Rome, but it really was not a problem. We have stayed out before and this hotel was easy to get to and get back to Rome. Dinner was fair. The service was quick and good. We had a group of 81, so I was impressed with their ability to serve that many quickly. Breakfast was typical of Italy. Nothing too special, but as good as most. I thought it was a nice place to stay for our visit to Rome.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cWorst customer service\u201d", "Author": "JOSE ANGEL C", "ReviewID": "UR127078036", "Content": "In our visit to Rome we stayed in this hotel. It is very distant from the city, no nearby restaurants or stores. We were part of a tour so we didn't have much choice. The service was horrible, very hostile staff. The worst experience was at dinner time. My daughter is allergic to pepper and all the food served that day contained pepper. She talked to the staff and asked if they could please bring her something else. The head waiter literaly yelled at my daughter \"what is the problem, you no like the food, there's nothing else for you\". I even asked if they had another menu or something I could buy so my daughter could eat. Their reaction was that the kitchen was already close and they were not cooking anything else. The kitchen was close in early afternoon, you could imagine sleeping with an empty stomach. They do not consider at all the allergies customers might have. On the other hand, the rooms were clean and comfortable in space but the beds were too small. If you hope to find a cool air conditioner this won't be the experience. The air conditioner worked more as a heater than a cooling system. It was too hot to be real. In general terms the hotel was clean and somewhat comfortable, but the customer service was HORRIBLE. The worst I have ever experienced.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cOutside the city, but a nice retreat...\u201d", "Author": "Vanberkomj", "ReviewID": "UR115461002", "Content": "I stayed with at the Hotel La Meridienne during the first leg of my EF Tour, July 2011. The hotel was welcoming to our group and provided a nice, secluded retreat away from the city. We enjoyed the pool, breakfast, and free wi-fi. The dinner was a bit lackluster, as was the location. A few notes--for those that care--there is a soccer field, a grocery store within a mile, and a very friendly house dog. The rooms were sparse, but did include a refrigerator, a balcony, and a bath tub (deep and separate from the shower).", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel!\u201d", "Author": "joe459", "ReviewID": "UR114762527", "Content": "I've stayed at many hotels in europe in the past year and i have to say that this was truly the nicest. It is about an hour outside the city of Rome so make sure you have the time and transport to travel to and from the hotel. The hotel is located in a woods area in a town outside of the city. The hotel is large and the picture is true it does have a swimming pool! The hotel lobby is large and there is a nice bar with a piano player every evening. The rooms are very nice and clean. There were four single beds in our room to accommodate the occupancy we requested. The bathrooms were very nice, each had a tub, shower, toilet and a large sink and were very roomy. Each room had its own balcony and ours overlooked the pool. I only have a few complaints for this hotel and I am sure they can be overlooked because it was a very nice hotel otherwise. The wifi in the hotel only worked in the lobby and not through out the hotel like stated by the hotel. The worst thing was the continental breakfast. It was very plain with only cereal and a role which were both very bad. I know your most likely saying, \"How can cereal be bad?\" but somehow it was. Overall the hotel was very nice and I would recommend it to someone who would like to spend time in Rome but stay outside the hustle and bustle of the city.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mechanicsburg, PA", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Traveler0714", "ReviewID": "UR78530527", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel about a month ago for one night. It was my last night in Italy. I wasn't at the hotel for very long because my flight departed from Rome at the crack of dawn the next morning. The hotel lobby is very fancy and elegant. It's really pretty and nice. There is an elevator and it was fast, but theres only room for two people and their luggage. The rooms are not too bad. They're nice and simple. My room had two single beds and a set of bunk beds. It was clean, although I do remember some foul odor about the air...but it disappeared then. There was a desk and chair in the room. The bathroom was kind of small, but it was clean and had shower, sink, toilet, etc. I had a nice balcony. Unfortunately, it didn't have any chairs for sitting outside, but I had a great view of the pool and it was nice to get some fresh Italian air. The restaurant was ok. I had pasta for my first course and then I had pork and potatoes for the main course. It wasn't that great, pretty darn average food. Dessert wasn't bad though, I had some kind of pie with fruit. Nice dining room. By the time I had had dinner and settled in, the swimming pool had closed. It was really big and looked inviting and nice, so I was sort of mad when I didn't get to go swimming in it. Instead, I sat outside on this nice little porch overlooking the pool. It had nice benches and chairs and just a great atmosphere. In the lobby there are plenty of chairs to sit around and they even have a TV with DVD player, just ask and they'll probably let you use it. Also, there is a bar. The nice staff offered my friends and I a free soda. How nice. Also during the evening, I got to see an Italian wedding ceremony with singing and dancing. It was very neat to experience. I had a great time hanging with friends that evening at this hotel. Later, I went to bed. The bed was fine, but the room was actually really chilly to sleep in. Well, it was sort of a chilly evening that night. Another suggestion for you, bring ear plugs, the walls are pretty thin and you can hear right through them and you can easily hear everything out in the corridor and the hall. I had to get up at 3 AM that morning. Since I left so early, the hotel provided me with a breakfast bag. The breakfast bag was probably one of the worst things I ever ate in my life, though, so don't get too excited about this. It had a pre packaged, lemon flavored, nasty croissant, apricot juice (ewww), and something else that was not palatable to me. The airport is about an hour away and the city of Rome is pretty far too. So this place is kind of out of the loop, keep that in mind when booking. I don't think there is too much around. This hotel is given 4 stars, and I thought it was pretty nice. I don't know if I'd stay here again, mainly because of the location. But I'd certainly love to return to Rome and Italy!!", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Troy, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cMy favorite hotel during our trip to Italy\u201d", "Author": "BeckyAmen", "ReviewID": "UR72942845", "Content": "Our school group stayed here during our visit to Rome.
