There is also a cheap bar across the road which is very lively (it's part of a hostel but good atmosphere) and a nice restaurant just two doors down. If you had a room at the front I expect it would be noisy but we were at the back and it was fine. However, it is not really that great a location for the sites of Rome so you need to be prepared for a lot of walking or use the Metro/buses, which are close by. Our room was clean but that's about the only positive. The air con was very ineffective, tiny TV on top of the tall wardrobe, small shower, and dark outdated room. My bed was comfortable but my friends matress was old lumpy and springy. Luckily we were in a triple room so she could swap the matress! I think if you just want a clean base without many other expectations for your accomodation then it's ok, but I would sincerely hope that something a little fresher and more modern for the same price could be found. There was no fridge, tea/coffee facilites, safe or other amenities in the room! Some of the reviews said the area was unsafe but we found it perfectly fine, as two females, and never felt any problems regarding security. Our room price didn't include breakfast so I can't comment on the food but the other negative was that the free Wifi was only intermittantly available and you had to go to the breakfast room to be (90%) sure it would connect!", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cLaptop and Ipad was stolen from room.\u201d", "Author": "Nicole F", "ReviewID": "UR117089275", "Content": "My MacBook Pro Laptop and my parents Ipad was stolen out of the room.

I paid $480 for 4 nights for double room thru orbitz.com with coupons/discounts. The hotel is less than 10 min. walk from Termini and 3 min from another metro station. There are couple more hotels in the same building. The hotel is run by an Italian family (unlike Indians next door), very polite and friendly.

You'll be lucky to find anywhere better value for money in the whole of Rome. Although only 5 minutes from the Termini station it is actually in a very good neighbourhood, very quiet and with lots of restaurants close by. Never once did we feel unsafe, even at night. It also makes it easy to get around Rome as you have the train, metro and buses just 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms are spacious, clean and tidy, and the bathrooms are small but well kept and have complimentary toiletries that are replaced each day. I had a balcony that looked over onto the interior courtyard where I could sit and read and plan the next day\u2019s activities. Breakfast was your standard buffet continental affair with a great coffee machine and a selection of croissants. The breakfast room also doubles as a bar and the hotel staff really will serve you 24/7, even opening the room just for you. By far the most important aspect of this hotel is the staff. They are welcoming and friendly and will do anything they can to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The girl on reception through the day is wonderfully helpful. I never got her name but you\u2019ll know who I mean the instant you meet her. She will give you maps and directions, make reservations for museums (Borghese) and restaurants. She knows all the best places to eat at exceptionally good value for money. Almost ever night we had a different restaurant recommendation and they were all superb. For all round value for money you will not get anything better in this price range in the whole of Rome.
