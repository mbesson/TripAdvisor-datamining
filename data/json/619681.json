Let me begin by saying that the main reason to stay at this hotel is the staff. Everyone is so incredibly helpful and friendly and our trip wouldn't have been the same without their daily assistance. Daniela, Jonas, Leo and Alessio all provided very helpful suggestions from sight seeing tips and metro instructions/directions to restaurant recommendations and cultural commentary. You are in great hands with the staff at Hotel Soho. The hotel is located on the Gran Via - a busy, but mostly quite main street - across from the Urgell metro stop and about a 10 minute walk from Placa Catalunya and The Ramblas. The location is great - it's away from the super-touristy areas, but still close enough to everything to be convenient. The hotel is very contemporary with interesting architectural and design details at every turn. We stayed in an Urban room overlooking the park behind the hotel and were very pleased with the space and amentities. The bed was a little harder than I am used to, but the pillows were very comfortable making for an overall positive sleeping experience. I also liked the lighting system, the electric shades and the ability to open various window panels for fresh air. The water pressure in the shower was great and the separate toilet room was another good feature. Our room and the hotel in general are very clean and well maintained. Our toilettries were replentished when needed and we could choose to reuse our towels or get new ones based on where we placed them each day. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel during our stay and it was completely satisfactory. The selection included eggs, breakfast meats, cold cuts, cheeses, fruit, muffins, pastries, toast, cereal, and yogurt. The coffee is Nespresso, which we also enjoyed. And since this was our vacation, we appreciated that the service continued until 10:30am. The breakfast server was very friendly and accommodating and she remembered our coffee preferences by the second day. We also greatly enjoyed the rooftop pool area. Although the temperature during our stay was only in the 60s, the sun was very warm. We were able to sit out on several afternoons after our sightseeing excursions. The pool was a bit chilly however. The business center is convenient with two computers, a TV and sitting area. There's also a coffee machine, but the coffee is 1 euro - it would have been nice to have complimentary coffee considering the cost of the stay. One of my only complaints. As for general Barcelona tips: - We utilized the metro a great deal. It is very cost efficient (get the T-10 ticket for about 9 euro)and super easy to figure out once you become familiar with the lines and directions in which to travel. The Urgell metro stop is literally out the front door of the hotel. We also walked a great deal, but it was nice to be able to hop on the metro when we'd had enough walking. - The tourist information booths are super helpful. If you plan to go to Monserrat, go straight to the one on Placa Espanya and you can get the necessary tickets there before catching the train. - Daniela recommended Teresa Carles restaurant near Placa Catalunya and it was my favorite meal while in Barcelona. It is a vegetarian restaurant, but the food is phenomenal. The owners are a local Catalunyan family and they have a farm just outside the city where they grow all of their own produce that they serve in the restaurant. We had delicious assortment of croquettes, an awesome pumpkin and leek soup, my husband got a mushroom spinach risotto with shaved parmesan, and I had an amazing eggplant parmesan type dish with mushrooms, a delicious tomato sauce and cheese melted on top.

My street facing room could be considered noisy by most, however as I live in London I am used to street noise. The room lighting is very modern, which is interesting and cool but not very practical for putting on make up. If you can, bring along a little lamp or light, or a portable mirror to apply your make up closer to the windows. I would also advise simply hailing a cab from outisde the hotel.

The hotel is very central, in one of the best areas of Barcelona, close to everything but at the same time not in the middle of the chaos of the ramblas. So the location is very nice, around there you can find plenty of restaurants for dining out, and in 10 mins walking distance you are in the heart of the ramblas and of the old town. Service was very efficient, and the price I paid was absolutely low even for the very low standards of Barcelona these days. The rooms are very modern, essential but designed well by good architects. It has to be said that this is not unusual in Spain, there are now several chains of hotels which are have design rooms even if they are 2 or 3 stars, the difference with hotels in, say, France or UK, is huge in this respect. Breakfast was good, efficient (self service so you don't need to wait for waiters), with lots of food of all types, and most importantly, cheap at 10 euros (some hotels make you pay 25 these days!). However, and here I come to the negatives, this hotel has been left to its own since when it was built, and you can see that by seeing some details which are a bit run down (curtains, or chipped furniture, etc.), but most important, in the whole hotel there was this horrible smell of wet carpeting, which is really annoying for a modern hotel. Both in the room and in the corridors this smell really ruined the experience, I think it should not be too expensive to give it a good cleanup and perfume all the areas of the hotel, no? I think this whole feeling of run down, that musty smell, will not make me go there again, also considering that N&N, the same hotel chain, has other better hotels in Barcelona.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTrendy, Clean and Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Leila G", "ReviewID": "UR125520502", "Content": "I visited Soho Hotel for the NYE weekend - we were really pleased that we picked Soho Hotel.

It's easy to travel from and to the airport (we took the Aerobus which stops on the Gran Via - return ticket 9,15\u20ac per person) Getting places is easy: the nearest metro station is Urgell (almost right outside the door) but you can just walk to Plaza Catalunya (10-15mins) which is the starting point of la Rambla. Breakfast room is nice and trendy as well, although a bit chilly during our winter stay. Choices were good enough for us, with meat, eggs, potatoes, croissants, etc. Big bonus is the free wifi access in the hotel. If you didn't bring any internet phone or laptop you can still use the free internet access on the pcs in the multimedia room in the basement. Our main luggage was lost and delivered a day late, but the hotel took care of the handling when it was finally delivered: they kept it in a safe storage until we returned from our day trip, and also on our last day they stored it for a few extra hours after checkout free of charge so we could have one last goodbye visit to Barcelona while waiting for our flight back home. The hotel staff was great: our room's towels were changed and beds were made up every day, and the reception staff was eager to help with advice and recommendations for restaurants etc... Minor issue: we had a room on the lowest floor on the street side where the traffic outside is very obvious. Took us a day or two to get used to this, so if you're a light sleeper you might request a room located in the center or back of the building. We were offered to move to a quieter room but we liked the brighter outside views and activity of the front room so we stayed and didn't regret it.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sleaford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "dixiefish61", "ReviewID": "UR124292087", "Content": "We stayed at the Soho hotel for 5 nights and have just returned.

The hotel is well placed for all main attractions such as La Rambla, the Marina, Olympic Park and the Joan Miro foundation. The hotel is right next to the Urgell metro station but if you are travelling in from the airport, take the Aerobus as it stops 1 minute walk from the hotel and is great value at \u20ac5,30. The hotel was opened in 2006 and so is still in top condition. The rooms are very contemporary with a modern feel. Note that there is no facility to make tea/coffee in the rooms but the are vendors within 30 seconds of the hotel all selling drinks to take away. There also is no hotel bar but we didn't miss this at all as there are so many in the area. The breakfast available is served buffet style and offers hot and cold food, fruit, cakes as well as more traditional fare. We were on the 4th floor at the front and although we could hear the traffic it was never a problem. There was another couple who changed rooms as they strggled with noise so it might be worth asking for a room at the back of the hotel if you like complete silence.

I mean literally, we stand there waiting while he was busy answering every possible phone call, calling somewhere himself, shifting the papers and stuff like that... We had an 'urban' room which apparently you can only book through the hotel website. It was quite big, with a little couch near the window (backyard view). Despite what other reviewers said, we didn't find the room to be any dark, perhaps that can depend on the weather. It was sunny while we were staying in Barcelona, so once you've opened the blinds the sun really filled the whole room. I'd recommend to book the Terrace room if the weather is really nice, its not so much of a price difference (at least it wasn't for our dates) but I expect it should be really good. The lighting design is quite nice too and in general the hotel is very modern, but still cozy. But it did surprise me that you still have to use the actual key to enter the room, the plastic card is for lights only. Other thing that put me off a little was the wardrobe, which is not really a wardrobe but a curtain in the corner with a few shelves and a coat rack. Part of the design I guess :) The metro station is literally just outside the hotel, somehow it seemed to be far from what was shown in the map. The hotel itself is about 10-15 minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya, which IMHO is just a little bit far from what I'd like it to be.

The location is PERFECT--maybe a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas. Having visited Las Ramblas at night, I was very glad we weren't any closer because of the late night noise and activity. Though Gran Via is a major street, our room was very quiet at night and we slept well. We were very near to pharmacies, cafes, restaurants, and the street itself was clean, comfortable and beautiful. Our street was very safe, even when we returned from dinner very late. One note--we didn't experience a single uncomfortable situation in Barcelona though we were told pick pocketing was rampant. Don't make yourself look like a target and you'll find the same to be true. The hotel is modern in design and felt WAY more expensive than we actually paid. We were thrilled to receive an upgraded room and a complimentary bottle of Cava--probably because we noted it was our Honeymoon! Our room was very large for typical European standards and we had ample space. Our bed was two twin mattresses pushed together, which some guests might dislike, but we liked having plenty of personal space and the movement-insulation from the other person. The mattresses were firm and the linens were super soft and comfortable. The AC worked great throughout our stay, but like many European hotels, the room key is necessary to power the room, so it did heat up a little while we were away. We were nothing but pleased with the space. However, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to someone who hated modern design enough to ruin their comfort level. The bathroom was in a glass cube in the room with blinds that opened and shut with a switch inside the bathroom. We found this design choice to be really interesting and fun--the only problem was that if someone went into the bathroom at night, the light from inside still shined pretty brightly into the bedroom, even with the blinds shut. Otherwise, we loved the design and feeling like we were in a very expensive boutique hotel for such a low price. The rooftop deck and pool were beautiful and I would have loved to spend some more time up there. The view itself was great! The international staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They all spoke perfect English and were great at recommending restaurants and getting us a taxi to the port. I will definitely stay at the Hotel Soho when we return to Barcelona.

The room we had had no outlook but was very quiet and comfortable. Like another poster I managed to leave our safe open but nothing was taken. I think the problem may be that the code is cancelled after the safe has been open for more than a few minutes. We managed to check out of the hotel and be checked into Barcelona airport within half an hour! The areobus is terrific and they run about every 10 minutes from virtually opposite the hotel. The bus is the A2 and you get it outside the terminal. Inside the terminal there was a queue of people at the information desks, confirming which bus and getting detailed maps of Barcelona on which the airport bus stops are clearly marked. Arrival at the hotel was quick - it was the second stop. We couldn't believe the value for money were getting for meals. Guito's is a restaurant / bar 20 metres from the hotel front door. We ate there 3 times and had their menu of the day - usually 10 euros for 3 courses which includes a fresh bread roll and a drink each. If two of you take a glass of wine they just give you the bottle. Wine by the bottle there was just over 6 euros in any case! I am as certain as I can be that it is Guitos that supply room service to the Hotel Soho. We regularly saw waiters taking covered food on trays along to the hotel and later saw an identical tray by the pool on the hotel roof. We were there 6 nights and enjoyed the breakfast but a couple of doors along from the hotel you can get a croissant and a coffee for 1.5 euros. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the Placa Catalunya and we regularly bought large bottles of water there to take back to the hotel. It was rather belatedly that we found an almost secret minimarket between Guitos and the Hotel Soho. There is no obvious sign and we did a double take when we realised.

I spent many hours researching hotels in Barcelona, ended up choosing Hotel Soho and we couldn\u2019t be happier with our choice. The most important things to me were wifi access in the rooms, price, location, comfort, cleanliness and as silly as it seems\u2026a tub. After long days of walking, trust me it is nice. I read all the reviews and everything seems to be very accurate. The staff was always helpful and nice, the d\u00e9cor is modern but inviting, the location is GREAT. Being right on Grand Via and central to everything was much better than being way out on the beach. The neighborhood is very safe, but really, we didn\u2019t feel unsafe anywhere in Barcelona even very late at night. The buffet was included in our room price which we booked as a special and I would encourage you to check the web site for these deals. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and had many more choices than the average European breakfast buffet. We were in the Urban room on the courtyard side, which was fairly quiet, comfortable and spacious. The beds are two double put together but feels like a queen. The tub was deep and had a shower massage. I think it was meant more for bathing than showering because the glass comes half way across, but it is no big deal to throw a towel on the floor. The blinds close with a button for extra privacy if you want it, and the toilet is separate with a door. I want to also give the cleaning staff many kudos for their honesty. One day we left the safe open with our passports and cash inside and all was well upon return. Another day, we put the do not disturb light on (but I guess they did not see it, or they clean your room anyway) and left all our purchases on the bed before leaving for the day. When we returned, the items were neatly arranged on a made up bed and everything was accounted for. The pool looked nice, but we did not use it so I cant comment on that. The metro station is very close, and easy to navigate to anywhere you want to go. Just go down any station and purchase a T-10 ticket, which you or anyone can use 10 times. Also, the areobus to the airport is only about 1 block away so getting back to the airport for 5 Euro is easy and cheaper than a taxi (it runs every 10 minutes). However just know that if you are flying back to the US you will probably be at terminal 1 and not terminal 2 where it drops everyone off. We finally figured out that once the areobus drops you off you have to catch the green bus (free of charge) to terminal 1, which looks like they come by often. Get to the airport early if you want to hand in your receipts for the 14% money back, because the line is usually long and there is not much instruction on how to accomplish the task. We were running late for our flight so we did not do it. We consider the 14% a donation to the Catalon people who were all wonderful. One more tip, if you like to eat you HAVE to go to the restaurant \u201cMe\u201d, a catalon/Vietnamese/new Orleans fusion restaurant that was just amazing. Have the front desk make reservations for you, as you will need them. We ate at a lot of places and have to say this was the highlight of the trip! As far as attractions go, if I had to pick two things to do in Barcelona, my must do would be Sagrada Familia and Monserrat. Fantastic!

I know that 2pm check-in is reasonably standard in many hotels but this isn't meant to be a standard hotel. Other small inconveniences included: one soap (meaning we had to break it - half for the shower and half for the basin), a tiny light in the toliet by our ankles making it a very dark little room, sandpaper for toilet paper, a fairly dark bathroom overall, a blind between the bathroom and bedroom that we couldn't work out how to close (maybe you can't?) and our locks being changed by management whilst we were out with no message telling us this was happening (this had us trying our keys for ages before going back to the front desk - and then the new key sticking for a while as well).

What really made our stay even better was the staff. They are young, friendly, multinational and serious about the hotel business. They gave us really good suggestions for excellent meals (e.g., the Segons Mercat across the road). I didn't realise I'd erred when making my reservation (a room for one instead of 2) but they upgraded at no cost to accommodate us. I blew a fuse and they didn't lecture me, they just fixed it. The same thing went for the airconditioning, which was making the room too cold. They fixed it quickly and with professionalism. The rooftop pool was, of course, a real boon, as was the magnificent terrace. Public transport is fabulous and the youngsters helped us with planning our route when we weren't sure. Barcelona, I miss you already....but I want to come back and try the other hotels in this Nunez group. BTW, the Rambla de mar was a delight! And the shopping at the Desigual shops (one on the Rambla Catalana and one at Mare magnum, Rambla de mar) was very cool.

Leo greeted us at the concierge and executed a very speedy check in. His English was phenomenal and he was very helpful with any advice we needed. Room: The hotel is really a treat for people who enjoy design. Its appears that every square centimeter was well though out in this hotel. We stayed in an urban room, which faced the back courtyard. This provided extremely quite quarters with a cool urban backdrop. The room is small compared to other hotels i have stayed in, but definitional one of the more beautiful. There is enough room for all your essentials do to great design. Breakfast: We included breakfast into our three night stay. The pros are you get a basic section of hot dishes that don't change scrambled eggs, small sausages, fried potatoes. There are also hamon cold cuts, slices of cheese and a small assortment of fruit. Not sure if the orange juice was fresh, but could have been. There is also a nespresso machine for coffee and a larger assortment of baked goods.

The free wifi in the rooms is a really nice touch and very handy. It's location is good and around a 10 minute walk to La Rambla, very direct walk...and around 7 mins to placa catalunya which is a central point to catch the tourist bus ride which I would recommend as a good way to get around and see all the sights. Special mention to Alessio at the hotel who was superb (as were other staff too) at recommending restaurants - EVERYTHING we were recommended was superb. We particularly liked Agua, La Clara and the fish restaurant opposite the hotel... Sergot..?? I can also highly recommend Ciutat Comtal for a tapas lunch...excellent value for money and fantastic food!! This is around an 8 minute walk towards placa catalunya. Other fun bits are the 26th floor at W hotel for cocktails and lunch at La Bocqueria market. The only points to consider about the hotel are the lighting in the rooms/bathrooms is poor, but that's all in keeping with the design and concept of the hotel so not a lack of attention and the hotel doesnt have a bar, although not an issue for us it can be for some.

Room had a modern design and was quite comfortable. Lighting in the bathroom could be a little brighter (especially the WC area) and the shower glass could be wider to prevent water from escaping and flooding the main area of the washroom floor. These items were very minor in the grand scheme of things. We did have a complaint about the housekeeping. One day we decided to laze around the room and head out a little later. The housekeeping staff kept urging us to leave so the room could be made up. Around 3pm when we told them that we would not be leaving for another 30 minutes the lady was rude in her response. When we did leave as promised in 30 minutes and returned late that night after dinner we found the room was not made up. This was a little disappointing. We did find the front desk and breakfast staff was very pleasant and helpful. They did keep reminding us not to carry our passports, extra money and valuables because of the pick pockets. We were careful but did not feel reason to be more alarmed than other tourist destinations. We did feel safe walking around the hotel and the city. Would consider this hotel on returns to this city.

But beware. if you are travelling by Eazyjet the bus drops you at T2 section B.

Plenty of towels, etc, though toiletries are pretty basic. The bathroom was very clean; as others have mentioned the somewhat unusual setup was a bathtub/shower in a separate room but with a glass panel (instead of a wall) between it and the bedroom, with electronically controlled blinds offering privacy. The actual toilet was through a separate door adjoining the shower room. I personally wouldn't see how this would be much of an issue for anyone.

The staff are very friendly and will help you out with anything you need. They even speak good english. The hotel is very clean and has a modern glass lift to get you to your room and the rooftop swimming pool and chill out area. On my first afternoon after a 4hr train trip from france sitting on the roof soaking up the sun was the perfect way to unwind. You can order food and snacks from the terrace, you can take a tip in the pool or you could watch the world go by on the gran via. I was given the option of upgrading free of charge (I had the cheapest room) so I took the option to overlook the gran via. While you could just hear the traffic noise the double glazing was very good. The room was much bigger than expected with room for two single beds, a massive desk, two cool looking chairs, big lcd tv and small table for eating if you order room service. The lighting system is all electronic and is really cool. The decor of the room is all muted browns and light greens. The mix of glass and aluminium really works well and is far superior to any hotel I have been in, better than london and better than france (for the price). The location is perfect its not on the Rambla, its in the cooler more chilled out part of town. Anyone who complains about this is an idiot, and should go stay on Rambla with the pick pockets and tacky eateries. The best way to get about is to get a t10 ticked for the metro, it wont take you long before you are navigating the metro like the locals, and unlike london the tube has air conditioning. The buffet breakfast is very good indeed, you have the choice of croissants or pain au chocolat, Doughnuts, and other tempting pastries and cakes with coffee, tea, juice or just water.

It was just amazing. We spent 8 nights at the SOHO Hotel in July 2010. This hotel is great for many reasons: 1. The location is great; It is a 5 minutes walk from the University and about 8 minutes from Plaza Cataluyna. It is half-way between Sagrada Familia and Cathedral of Barcelona. There is a metro station, Urgell, just in front of the hotel (or very very close) 2. The staff is wonderful and always willing to help. You could learn and practice Catalan with them for those who like languages. They are fluent in English and Spanish. 3. The room was great. It is rated a 3-stars hotel. Indeed it is a 4-stars hotel without a doubt at the price of a 3-stars. 4. We took breakfast for two mornings. The food is great and the menu is quite elaborate for a breakfast. 5. We were in Barcelona when the weather was between 35 to 38 celsius for the whole week. Before going to dinner, we enjoyed the big jacuzzi (or the small swimming pool) each day. This facility is again just great. 6. After a long travel from Canada, we took the AEROBUS at 5.05 euros from the airport to the hotel. No taxi is needed. The bus goes on Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, the same street of the hotel. So you just need to watch the numbers to be dropped practically in front of the hotel. SOHO hotel is located at 543-545 Gran Via. 7. The hotel and the room were very clean. The design of the room is unique. The conditionned air worked perfectly well. 8. It was a special occasion as we celebrated my wife's birthday. If you have a chance, buy tickets to see a concert or a show at the Palau Musica Catalina (metro Urquinaona). We went to see a concert of spanish/catalan guitar. The price was reasonable. 9.

By making an early reservation, we were able to secure a rooftop room with terrace. It's always difficult to know what a hotel will be like especially the room chosen. We were very pleased on both counts. The hotel location is about 10 minutes walk from the start of the old town in one direction and a similar distance from the Placa Espanya, in the other. There are many restaurants in the vicinity. Coming from the airport, we caught the Aerobus which stops a couple of hundred metres down the street from the hotel at Urgell. These run every 10 minutes or so and the fare was only \u20ac5. - a very easy trip. The hotel is described as minimalist, but don't let that put you off. It has all that you could want, unless it's carpets in the bedroom. The designer has managed to squeeze everything into a space between 2 buildings, but at no time did anything feel cramped or oppressive - all very stylish. Our room was large with a sitting area and terrace. This was at the front of the hotel and we were initially concerned that it would be noisy from the street below, especially if we slept with the terrace door open. There is some traffic noise, but the air conditioning in the room was so unobtrusive that we could close the door and sleep in comfort. Another concern was the louvered blinds to the windows and bathroom - would these be effective? No problem at all - the blinds are between the panes of double glazing and operate at the push of a button, as does the room lighting. Mood lighting at the touch of a button - you don't see this very often in a hotel room. In addition, there are conventional blinds on all of the windows which keep out the morning sun. The room was very clean, the bedding and towels being changed every day. We only had one minor problem - the batteries in the room safe needed replacing. We reported this and it was done immediately. The hotel has a breakfast buffet, which initially seemed minimalist too. However, there was fresh orange juice, teas, coffee, cereals, fruit, cheese, cold meats, eggs, bacon, mushrooms, breads, crousants and pastries - all you could want and all replenished as necessary. When we make a return trip to Barcelona, we will not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Soho again.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel and location!\u201d", "Author": "Pilar/Santiago", "ReviewID": "UR68404199", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a one week stay at the Soho Barcelona and could not have been more pleased!

Could get noisy in the evening but then the kids go in at about 9.00.!!. Not a quiet location but you are in the city. I think the rooms to the front would suffer from road noise as it is on abusy road. Roof top terrace was very nice to sit - no bar or phone for room service - just bring your own. Pool was freezing - not particularly large and a few loungers - nice area to sit and chill though after a busy day in the city. Location is great - about 1/2 way between LaRamblas and Place Espania so makes a good route round the city.

Chose the place due to tripadvisor ratings, it's accessibility for the Barcelona shuttle bus to and from the airport, along with a great rate obtained on the hotel's website. In fact, we obtained their spring/summer package which included an upgraded room, with breakfast each day, a bottle of cava and tapas one night, all taxes, for 378 Euros total. An average, per night, rate of about 126 Euros, which, after lots of research, turned out to be an outstanding rate for Barcelona during the period we were there. As others have stated, the rooms and facilities are very nice, very hip and very contemporary. We were in a room facing the courtyard at the back of the hotel, so it was very quiet. We found the bed to be quite comfortable, and the room spacious enough for our needs. Enjoyed the breakfast each morning, also, which was completely adequate, as was the bottle of cava, with tapas, in the hotel's breakfast room the night we arrived, too tired and worn out to go out exploring for restaurants, after a very long 20+ hour, multi-stop, trip originating in San Francisco. About the only complaint (and this isn't much of a complaint) is that we'd have preferred a location maybe two blocks closer to Cataluna Square, from where most of our sightseeing began. But the walk wasn't bad and, as stated earlier, the hotel's location on Gran Via was absolutely perfect for the Barcelona airport shuttle bus which stopped at the intersection of Gran Via and Urgell, only about a block and one-half from the hotel. Return shuttle to the airport was from a location about another block further away which runs parallel to Gran Via. This hotel is a real find, especially if you can get it at a rate as good as that which I found. But even if at a higher rate, we'd highly recommend the Soho Barcelona, in all its aspects. And Barcelona itself is really a fascinating destination. Our days (2 full days and until about 500 p.m. the third day) were filled from early each morning, until late each night.

A baby cot was provided for us at no extra charge upon my emailed enquiry about one as well which was great. We stayed in a standard double room. The rooms are very modern with a funky design you'll no doubt read about in other reviews. I loved it personally. Even for our one year old toddling about the place they were pretty good although the tiled flooring is always a hazard over carpets for youngsters prone to taking a tumble. But no issues with us. Only minor problem was lack of storage in the rooms. There's one rack with a fair bit of coat hanger space but no drawers for underwear or t-shirts etc. Particularly tricky with all the baby stuff. Managed with the shelf space in the room (2 by the rack and a long space above the bed) but it wasn't ideal and would have been nicer to have been able to tidy it away a bit more. A price worth paying though I thought for the stylish room design. Location on the gran via is great and from there we managed to walk everywhere (Placa de Madrid and the fountain is 10 minutes walk, as is top of La Rambla). Hotel is pretty well soundproofed and heard minimal noise from other guests or outside. Breakfasts were very good as well (7-11am) with particularly nice fresh coffee and orange juice. The cakes were nice too if you're into your cafe und kuchen Deutschland style :-) Only other issue was lack of a bar in the hotel which might have been useful on occasions where we didn't want to wander out.

The Positive: \u2014 Perfect amount of breakfast to get your day started; eggs, yogurt, cheeses, jamon, fresh fruit, coffee, juice selection, cereals, breads. \u2014 Great roof top view & very inviting-looking pool (it was too cold outside to use) \u2014 Modern/sexy hotel room \u2014 Fun decor throughout the hotel \u2014 Location - we felt safe in the area around SOHO and Gran Via, but we're also big-city folks. \u2014 Metro is right there! \u2014 Staff was always helpful and nice, even with our butchered Spanish. \u2014 It was raining for 2 days straight while we were in Barcelona, and SOHO lent us an XL umbrella to keep dry. That 1 small gesture sealed our LOVE of SOHO. The Negative: \u2014 Their hi-tech push button \"Do Not Disturb\" did not work in our room. Or we're too stupid to figure out how it worked. \u2014 No iron in hotel room. We had to call the front desk and ask for one. Then they only brought us the iron board.

I was told that they have served tapas lots of times, but I explained I have never had pringles with tapas before. We were then offered a refund. On top of this on our first night we opened the windows to get a better view of the city. However, on one of the windows a metal piece from the inside fell out and the window could not be shut. We contacted reception twice and they could not close the window either. They told us maintenance would come and fix it. We went out for the evening and when we arrived the window was still open. This made the road even noisier and the air conditioning was facing directly opposite the window, meaning the cold air was going straight outside. When I complained about the tapas I explained our room situation but they said there was nothing they were full so we could not swap rooms and maintenance would fix the window to which they did.

Your room has dark hardwood floors, a bathtub and shower, floor to ceiling windows, a great bed, and automated lighting and blinds controls (this is really excessive but a great novelty). Of course there is a flat screen TV, and of course it only carriers standard definition channels (someone let me know when they find a hotel that carries HD content!), and as with other hotels in Spain there are no tissues. I also for some reason had a really hard time with drainage in both the sink and the bathtub (in the bathtub, even if I removed the stopper the water wouldn't recede from the tub for more than 10 minutes after a shower). The hotel also has a roof deck with a pool and covered seating area - this is a great way to relax after a day of sightseeing in the summer Barcelona heat. The breakfast was included in my rate and it was underwhelming but I didn't expect much. The hotel is right on Gran Via, which means it is super convenient (walking distance to central areas and metro is right on the corner) but it also means that a street-facing room gets lots of noise at all times of the day (Barcelona never sleeps!). This wasn't a big problem for me because I was so tired every day that I slept through everything but this section of Gran Via seems to be a popular ambulance route, so do be aware of that.

Caroline was remarkable and went above and beyond our expectations in helping us throughout our stay, but most importantly on our departure. After we left Hotel Soho on 26May2009 and we were checking in at the airport, we realized our camera and camera bag with all our vacation pictures of beautiful Barcelona and Spain were missing. We had no idea where we had left it? In the room? In the lobby? In the taxi? My husband contacted Carol Gasquez at Hotel Soho to check the room and lobby and she immediately contacted the taxi company and found the driver who fortunately had our bag. Carol not only located our camera bag, but then made the arrangements to have it sent back to us via friends we had still staying there. It was remarkable that she was able to find our camera and get it back to us! For this, we are very grateful! Without her help we would not have been able to communicate fast enough with the taxi company to find our camera and still be able to catch our plane and continue with our vacation plans. As a result of Carol\u2019s help, we were able to board the plane knowing that she had found and would return our missing camera and bag. Thank you very much for employing people like Carol! As a direct result of her willingness to help, combined with our overall experience at Hotel Soho Barcelona, if opportunity arises, we will plan to stay there again or at another NN hotel. Gratefully yours, Gary and Michelle ....\"", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel in ok location.\u201d", "Author": "vason", "ReviewID": "UR32796421", "Content": "We stayed three nights here and overall felt it was just a little above average.

The room was average size and very modernistic with lots of electronic gizmos for the lights and blinds. My main problem with this hotel was the room lighting, it was very dark in the room even with all the lights on. The bathroom was ok but again the lighting was not great and the design was just odd. Breakfast was decent and included in the price that we got. Internet use was free and with no wait every time we went to use it. The rooftop deck with pool was relaxing and a nice touch. The staff at the front desk could have been a little more helpful when asking for restaurant recommendations and such. Another thing to note is that we took the airport shuttle bus from Plaza de Catalunya to the airport for a little more than 4 Euro per person instead of taking a taxi which would have been around 30-40 Euro.

I booked the trip directly with the hotel and found that was the best price (it was more expensive through other websites). We upgraded to a balcony room which was great. It wasn't that much more a night and our room was big. We were on the back of the hotel, which made it quieter (though the view is nothing special). But the balcony is nice and relaxing and large. We had to move to a smaller room for our last night and that room was nice too. It was on the front of the building, which was a little louder but we still slept fine. It is very modern, with all kinds of lighting options. Both rooms have covered glass walls between the room and the bathroom, and pocket doors, so the sound privacy is not great for those who like a little more privacy in the bathroom. Also, the amenities they give are a little cheap--might have expected more from this class of hotel. The bed was more comfortable than most we encountered in Spain--not as hard as our other hotels. The location is both good and slightly challenging. You can walk to a lot of places and the metro stop is just steps from the hotel. But it is a bit farther from parts of the older city and the shopping districts than it looks. We definitely got a lot of exercise. Ideally, it would be located about 4 blocks closer to the placa de catalunya. It isn't , so knowing that is good for setting expectations. It is, however, right across the street from an Escriba pastery shop, which was a must stop every morning for the best pastery in town. Oh, and I don't agree at all with the suggestion that it is an unsafe area--this is completely false. We always felt safe and never saw anyone menacing at any time of day or night. The staff is friendly and tried to be helpful. They do not have a concierge so restaurant recommendations were not that good. But we had done our own research and found great places nearby for meals. They did call places for us and make reservations, which was nice. The night team did seem to get overly worked sometimes, but we never got locked out and never saw the front door locked even when we got home very late. Our one big hiccup was with the laundry. Not surprising, it is very expensive, but the form is very confusing. We thought we were marking wash only, but because of how the sheet is set up, they thought we were asking for our socks and underwear to be ironed. in fact, when we first read the laundry prices, it looks like socks and underwear are free, but that is not true. In the end, they understood that they had made a mistake and didn't charge us for ironing. On a related note, however, they do not have an iron in the hotel that you can use (not one in your room or even from housekeeping) meaning that you HAVE to pay them to iron. This was a sore point for us and we looked for a cheap iron to buy but then decided to just be a little messier than we'd have liked. Tip for the hotel: 4 and 5 star rooms have irons! We did end up eating breakfast twice in the hotel. It wasn't bad--nothing fancy, but it worked when we were very rushed. The food was fresh, which is better than we saw at some other places. I'm sure that restaurants down the block have better choices for less money. The free internet downstairs was great. We rarely had to wait for a computer, though they might want to add one or two more just in case. The pool looked great on the roof. Unfortunately, we never used it.

The tapas and wine included- really liked this, good selection of items and the wine was pretty good, it would have been perfect if it included water also, since it doesn't come with it. staff: okay but could have certainly given better advice. they told us the best way to get to most of the sights was to walk, this would have been fine but thier location is pretty far away from everything, 30 minute walk to Casa Batllo, almost hour to sagrada familia, remember you also have to walk a lot once you get to the sights. We were there long enough to get smart- our advice is to use the metro to get everywhere- it is faster, inexpensive, and will save your feet and energy to enjoy yourself more in barcelona. location: we wish would not have booked this hotel because of this. they are not exactly in good place, didn't feel that safe and was far from the sights. My suggestions is to find a hotel located on or next to the \"Passeig de Gracia\" street- lots of shops, restaraunts, casa batllo, and casa mila located on this street. If you find the right place near these sights you will also be closer to plaza catalunya than where the SOHO hotel is located. Also, there was a lot of construction going on in front and behind this hotel- which made walking to and from the hotel tricky. eating breakfast outside on their bottom terrace was loud- not a very nice out door atmosphere for enjoying a meal- ugly view behind the hotel. you can choose to sit inside if you want. tip: take the bus from the airport to Urgell & Gran Via; it is really easy to get there even with luggage, it is only 4.25 euros; take a taxi on the way back to the airport though- bus doesn't have the same route 1st impression: we let them know we would be arriving late. When we arrived around 12:30pm they had locked the door to get into the hotel and there was no one at the receptionist desk. I have never had this happen before in all my travels. The neighborhood didn't appear to be the safest, with several drunkards walking by and giving us trouble while we had our bags in hand. It was quite scary to show up to find our hotel closed. We decided to look for another way to get into the hotel. We walked around the front entrance into the basement parking garage and found another door that was also locked. we dialed the receptioist desk several times via the key code machine located next to the parking garage door to the hotel. I eventually sent two emails to the hotel letting them know we were standing outside. A anonymous man in the garage offered to help us by stading at the front door while we stood in the parking garage. After 20 minutes the receptionist finally answered the line and unlocked the door. Needless to say we were furious with this welcome and asked the receptionist where he had been. He stated he was helping someone with thier key to their room and stated he had only been away for five minutes. It was frustrating to to find out they lock the door at that time of night and that the receptionist can be called away at anytime to help someone in the hotel, where in which he has to lock the front entrance when he leaves. They could have put up a sign letting us know or better yet higher another employee to man the desk at all times. Needless to say, we always came back to the hotel at a decent hour for fear we may be locked out again at strange hour of the night. The next day another staff member at the reception desk asked us about our experience and let us know that is just the way they do things at the hotel and was nice to us about the unfortunate experience. They sent a small box of chocolates up our room with card apologising to us, which was a nice gesture.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cI had expected more\u201d", "Author": "BBestate", "ReviewID": "UR30747920", "Content": "We visited the Soho Hotel in May 2 adults and 2 teenagers.

We also thought Alessio on the front desk was brilliant - his restaurant recommendations never failed us and he had an amazing ability to juggle everyone's demands (no mean feat given the front desk staff seemed often to be there alone and have to act as room service/concierge/check in desk all in one). Not all the front desk staff were as consistently good. Things we didn't like so much: 1. The room lighting. Ok, so its funky and that's great, but you still need to be able to see in the mirror to put make up on/have a shave. 2. Breakfast. Which was generally ok but could have been better e.g why not fresh coffee instead of a vacuum jug, more choice of fresh fruit (one day there was only fresh pineapple and tinned pineapple), better quality yoghurt, another choice of juice other than orange etc. Breakfast was not included in our rate and we did feel a bit short changed paying extra for it. 3. Lack of services. This was our main gripe. There is no restaurant, bar or lounge area where you can get drinks or snacks - not even a can/snack machine, coffee machine or water dispenser anywhere we could find. The lack of a restaurant is not really a problem as there are loads of places to eat nearby. But it would have been nice to have had somewhere to get a drink/snack. A basic room service menu is provided - but with a \u20ac5 charge for delivery to the room (or \u20ac4 to the pool) its uneconomic to use it just for a beer or a tea/coffee. The only other source of refreshment is the in-room minibar - which we did use and was fairly reasonably priced by minibar standards but was only replenished once a day. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. We were out quite a lot and so this wasn't a major problem but it contributed to our feeling that this was really more of a B&B than a hotel - admittedly a very smart one - as the facilities were quite limited. There is a seating area on the pool deck and a small area with a TV and four chairs downstairs on the lower ground floor.

I felt the service was good and the free access to the two computers with free internet was a welcome extra, I find most European hotels now charge for use of the internet!. The biggest 'con' for me was the constant traffic noise from the Gran via (a major road through the city) this eight lane highway is situated right outside the front lobby. I will assume that rooms situated at the back of the hotel are probably much quieter so I would try and request one. Having stayed on the front side of the hotel I found myself unable to get any sleep, perhaps people used to traffic noise would be ok but I'm used to living in the countryside!. Having no sleep was obviously going to be an issue with a day full of busy sightseeing, so I had to visit reception the following morning and after initially seeming to be a little uninterested the gentleman was very helpful and moved me to a quieter and larger room. I can't say there is much else to be 'wary of' staying here, perhaps a few more English channels would be nice, there seems to be a large proportion of German and French channels and BBC world can get a little boring at times!! It might have been nice to use the pool, but I guess it's normal procedure to close it doing the winter.

The hotel's location was very good, near one of the universities and 2 of the major shopping areas - lots of action close by & I did not have too much trouble finding my way around (with a bit of help from the Concierges), even though it was my first time in the city, and I was on my own for a bit, as my partner was at a conference for a few days. The property is an approximately 50+ room boutique hotel, and to be honest, this being my first trip to Europe, and having worked in management for a large high-end hotel in Vancouver, BC (Canada), the Soho definitely surpassed my expectations! It is a very well taken care of property - extremely clean, beautiful, kind of funky, but still fairly minimalist (which we liked), and our room had some nice features and was quite spacious for what we booked. The rooftop terrace was also a perfect place to spend a couple hours in the afternoon when the weather allowed, reading a book or whatnot - good view of the city as well. The breakfast set-up was also very well done, set up in the restaurant from 7-11am, and included in our room charge. It was not just continental, but included some hot items as well as fruit, yogurt, cereal, pastry, etc. - very substantial (healthy & not-so healthy) and items were refilled in a timely manner. The service was outstanding, including the Housekeeping, but especially the Front Desk/Concierge service, in particular Alessio and Erica, who were very informative, patient, gracious and had some excellent recommendations of restaurants and events that really helped to make our trip! They also helped us procure tickets for a \"football\" game, and a flamenco show, both of which were a lot of fun. The only mildly negative item that I would say is that part-way through our stay, apparently a family with teenage offspring moved in next door, as we could hear their mother yelling at them quite clearly (luckily in English) a few nights in a row! Overall I would completely recommend this hotel and their staff, and it should go without saying that my standards are quite high after having worked in the industry for several years.

There is only one route. It costs 4,05 Euro per person and tickets can be bought from the driver or a ticket machine outside the bus. Since we do not speak Spanish, it was a bonus that the SoHo hotel web site listed the name of the area to get off the Aerobus (Urgell). It was a bit hard to understand (again because we don't speak Spanish or Catalan) and I would recommend asking the driver or another passenger to point it out to you. After exiting the bus, we walked a few blocks up Gran Via and there it was like a beacon - SoHo! You cannot miss the large sign and it was a welcome sight. Be sure to write down the exact address so you know which way to walk. The Hotel: Very cool! We ran around the room for 10 minutes checking things out. The textured floor is a nice touch. The lighting buttons (you must have a card in to use electricity) are very interesting - hot and soft settings (like bright and ambient light) and an off button that I hit on more than one occasion thinking it was for the bedroom and left my boyfriend in the dark in the bathroom! Nice toiletries and bathroom kit with emergency razor and toothbrush. We loved the colors and spaciousness of the room. The bed was extremely comfortable, really fluffly and cozy. The only thing I would mention is that the walls are a bit thin - we heard the activities of other couples during the night. Not bad except when they talk and talk and talk! Towels could be a bit softer. Also, the only English channel was BBC News. Mini bar met its purpose. In room safe worked though was a bit hard to get to (right next to luggage rack in the room). Missed having a bar or restaurant in the hotel. The rooftop was nice - you must get towels from the front desk. Only about 8 sunbeds but there is also a more covered lounge like area to relax in. Pool is to cool off only - max about 3 feet deep. Location: SoHo is just about one block from the Urgell metro stop. Super easy to get to attractions. Also, since the hotel is on the Gran Via (basically a main drag of the area), we often opted to walk to a site instead of take the metro (used only 8 of the 10 visits on the T10 journey card we purchased). Lots of cafes nearby to grab a drink or snack. Tabac is also nearby for stamps. Staff: Staff was always very friendly and helpful. We asked for several recommendations and were provided with directions and information. I would have liked a few more suggestions and a map when we checked in instead of asking for one. I also would have appreciated some tips on the metro but we didn't know what we didn't know (for example, we were confused that the metro ticket machine asked what zone we wanted - Barcelona that you would want to visit is only zone one). Breakfast: Quite delicious. We always opted to eat outside. The food was good and there was plenty of variety. Wifi: Supposed to have it free but only worked outside and in the lobby. Overall, we had a great experience at this hotel. I loved the signature scent that you smell upon walking in the automatically sliding glass door. The two computers with free Internet were a big bonus. This hotel is a great value, great experience and good location.

Short walk from the Urgell/Gran Via stop on the Aerobus. We arrived just before 2pm & got into our room. We were on the 5th floor facing onto Gran Via, the room was plenty big enough with a large bed & trendy decor. Took a minute to work out the blinds but they are operated by buttons next to the bed. If you feel the need to shut the ones at the bathroom then this is the buttons next to the socket at the sink. You can also make the lights brighter by pressing the buttons again & there is a small spot at the desk- but no mirror. I saw into one of the inner rooms when it was being cleaned & I didnt think it looked that dark- not compared to the room we had in Florence last year, it had no light. Maybe the ones on the lower floors had less light, Kept meaning to time the walk down to Plaza Catalunya, say 15 minutes at tourist pace! Seemed less at night but that might have been the wine. There is noise from Gran Via, but it never bothered us. If you don't like traffic noise then don't come to a city. You would need to be a very light sleeper for it to keep you awake! I actually loved the fact that the city is still buzzing late into the night. The walk down Gran Via seemed very safe, well lit and wide streets. People's bad experiences had made me worry but I needn't have. Our first night we asked the guy on reception to recommend a restaurant which we went to but it was packed out, but it looked fab. Our 3 nights we ate on Rambla Catalunya & then on Ronda Universitat. All 3 meals were lovely & reasonably priced. We lunched a couple of times on Pasaig De Gracia at Tapa Tapa. Great spot for people watching. Our fav bar was on the corner of Gran Via & Rambla Catalunya. Out flight home was not until the evening so when we checked out the hotel kept our bags in a secure luggage room. As we were all walked out we took a taxi to the airport which was quick & comfortable & 34 Euros (not sure how they word out the supplement for the luggage & the airport, neither wonder he wouldn't let us lift the bags) eek!! Other than that I can totally recommend the Soho if you like your hotels modern, the staff were friendly, the breakfast was good the room was comfortable & the area was good.

After reading previous reviews we were surprised the hotel was this far away from the main tourist area. The hotel is situated on one of the main routes into the city centre and this four lane road generates a lot on noise all day and unfortunately all night as well. Also due to it being close to the local hospital there was constant sirens from ambulances. The room we were given was an inner room with no view and no natural light. This small sombre room was very depressing and we asked if we could be moved but were told the hotel was full and it was not possible. The polite staff assured us the next day there would be a choice of rooms available. The hotel consists of rooms overlooking the busy main road, inner rooms around a central shaft and rear rooms overlooking a park. The next day we were hoping for a rear room but were given one overlooking the main road, and although far brighter and cheerier the poor sound proofing caused terrible trafic noise. The other point worth noting is the hotel pool and seating area. The pool is tiny and has just 6 sunbeds around it. For a hotel with 51 rooms we thought this was inadequate, and in our 5 day stay we were unable to use it once. This was highly dissapointing as after paying a premium for staying in a hotel with pool facilities we wanted nothing more than to relax by the pool after a longday sightseeing. In hindsight we would have had better value if we had booked a hotel which was closer to the main attractions, quieter but without pool facilities.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cexcellent, I come back again and again\u201d", "Author": "ijkd", "ReviewID": "UR18910940", "Content": "This is a beautiful boutique hotel.

Next, the \"mood\" lighting in the rooms is novel, but completely impractical when you are trying to get ready for a night out, as you just look completely orange in the mirrors. Ladies beware! Also, when I asked for an iron I was told there was only 1 for the whole hotel, it was unavailable and I should use the laundry service provided by the hotel. I duly did this and have to say that my clothes seemed to come back with more creases then they started with. Not very impressive. There was also a broken tap in my room and the bathroom sink did not seem to produce hot water (though no problems with the bath/shower for water).

I also posted the same review on the NN blog site on their invitation. So I feel that I should write the follow up review after our recent return to BCN and Soho. Asun, the Director/Manager, contacted me almost immediately after I posted my comments to discuss them further. I elaborated on the situation and as a consequence she offered me one night's accomodation in the hotel if we were in BCN again. We had already planned a trip from France to Spain in June and knew we had to overnight in BCN again so I accepted her offer. In the end we decided to stay a second night there and make a weekend of it. Beforehand, I had to post a parcel of clean clothes to the hotel so they would be there on our arrival as we were doing some mountain climbing in France. Carol, another member of staff, was incredibly helpful throughout. I also booked the second night on a hotel booking website and Carol made sure we had the same room for both nights which was incredibly generous as I would defintely think we had one of their best rooms. Asun came out to meet me when we arrived on Friday afternoon and I also met Carol, both of whom were incredibly friendly. We stayed in room 64 which was at the back overlooking the park. I have to say I had two of the most peaceful nights sleep I've had in a long time. The room was pitch dark, there wasn't a sound and the bed was so comfortable. We had breakfast both mornings and while I don't eat pastries etc the buffet was impressive and is substantial enough to keep you going for hours. I checked out the downstairs media room as I needed to look up my email and I was very impressed - two pc's, a printer, spare printer paper, a large flat screen tv and some comfie chairs too. The location of the hotel is ideal; close enough to stroll into the centre but out enough to avoid the maddening crowds. There's a metro stop across the road so you are within minutes of everything. Thank you to the management of Soho; they proved their worth and did something which hotels don't do very often - they listened to complaints.

There is a wonderful rooftop pool (unheated) and terrace with great views over the city. It doesn't have a bar but room service will supply beer, wine etc to the room if you want it. Ideal location for exploring, 5mins walk to University Sq and 15mins to Placa Catalunya and there's a metro station (Urgell), right outside the front door.Overall a superb hotel and I would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bromley", "Title": "\u201cStylish and Sexy!!\u201d", "Author": "Lola18", "ReviewID": "UR14406195", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Soho at the end of Jan '08, and I have to say, we loved every minute of it. Our flight was delayed so we got a cab from the airport to the hotel, and were pleasantly surprised how quickly we arrived there (cost us about 25 euro). When we pulled up outside, we couldn't believe how stylish the hotel was, Soho really has the WOW factor!! The lobby is very contemporary, and the reception staff were very attentive and efficient (even though there was some confusion with our booking, this was resolved quickly). The rooms are where this hotel really oozes sex appeal, with the 'hot' and 'soft' mood lighting and modern bathroom with glass wall alongside the bath/shower (there are integral blinds you can close for privacy). The room was also a good size for a hotel so centrally located, (walking distance to las ramblas and just outside a metro stop), and had lovely comfortable beds with extra blankets provided, as the room was a little chilly at night. The real problem with sleep though is the NOISE!! As the hotel is located on a main road in a city which never sleeps, the traffic noise is constant. We traveled with another couple, who stayed in the room directly below us (at the front of the hotel), we are all in our twenties and took full advantage of the fantastic nightlife Barcelona has to offer, so we weren't exactly in bed early, but we all found the road noise an issue. Also, the floor level lights in the window recesses do not switch off and as the blinds do not block all of the light out, the room is never completely in darkness, which when added to the noise from outside can be really disturbing. I've since read another review from someone who took earplugs and eye masks to sleep in, and I think this is the solution!! We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, so cannot comment on it, but I would say that there are loads of great local cafes in which to eat and this is also a far cheaper option. Overall, our stay in Barcelona was fantastic, and was made all the better by staying at this hotel.

We were greeted with smiles from all of the reception staff who checked us in quickly and efficiently, they offered us maps and guide books of Barcelona complementry and showed us to our gorgeous rooms.

Basically the rooms where great, beds very comfy, shower very powerful, spacious and enough wardrobes space and hangers. Im sorry to say but there was a small problem, I hate moaning but it did annoy me sometimes. The NOISE! We were in the front rooms facing directly on to the main road and Barcelona dosn't sleep so we had to suffer with some of the traffic noise, it wasn't too bad but you will hear it. Our friends were directly above us and they moaned about it as well... We never ate there as the breakfast is too expensive and there are plenty of little baguette and toastie places which are alot cheaper and probably nicer. Anyway stay here it's great.

We were originally a group of 8, 4 couples from NY and then we had another couple join us from France for 3 of the 6 nights. I can honestly say we had a fabulous time in Barcelona and staying at the SOHO was one of the highlights of the trip. I am a bit of a clean freak so I am on pins and needles when checking into a hotel worrying about its cleanliness....the SOHO was immaculate the common areas were very clean the rooms were spotless and the maids were accommodating and honest. I had dropped a few euros under my bed and thought I would pick them up in the morning, I had forgotten about them until I returned to my room later and found that the maid had found them and placed them on my nightstand. WOW was I impressed with that. The rooms are fantastic and quite modern and the beds so comfortable. I loved the idea of the mood lighting and the blinds that controlled the view into the bath/shower. Please do not let this throw you off as if you require privacy the blinds in the shower/bath can be completely turned so that you have 100% privacy. If I were to have only one suggestion for the hotel it would be for more lighting in the bathroom but that would truly be my only one slight negative complaint. We had the breakfast included and it was great, lots of choices and all very delicious. We were so content with our breakfast that we never needed to stop for lunch. The location of the SOHO is amazing, besides having the two metro stations and several bus stops outside your door (less then a 30 second walk) you can walk to almost all the tourist attractions. AMAZING!! The whole staff at the SOHO are friendly and welcoming but there are two in particular that make you feel like family Alessio and Oliver. If I could sit here and write to you how FANTASTIC these two men are I would be witting for days. I have done quite a bit of traveling and have stayed at many hotels never have I come across two like Alessio and Oliver who besides always greeting you with a bright smile took the time to treat you like you were the only guest at the hotel and took their time to explain things of the city, sites to see and those to avoid, places to eat and made the reservations for you. It blows my mind that this hotel is a 3 star....if I were giving out the stars this should be a 4 star superior. All in all I have to say that my group of 10, we were all beyond pleased with the SOHO with the staff, its location.

HOTEL: the hotel was lovely the decor is very contemporary so if you are not into it then dont stay here. However for those of you that love the latest well dressed minimalistic look to your room then this is the place. With buttons to change the mood of the lighting in the room and flat screen tv of a decent size i loved my room and would definately stay here again. (got to watch a bit of the african football tournament) The pool was nice but it was not hot enough for us to get in but its location catches great sun. would be great in hotter weather. the media room was also nice with fast internet access and nice seating great for relaxing in front of the tv - nicely decorated also I didnt have breakfast at the hotel but the breakfast loung looked lovely. The staff were lovely and very helpful giving us directions and guidance on the train systems and local attractions, restaurants and bars. LOCATION; the location is great if you are up to the challenge of walking a couple of blocks or jumping on the train to and from ...for those of you with bigger budgets there are taxis everywhere so you never get stuck. My friend and i took the metro everywhere as we wanted experience barcelona transport and once we did a journey we realised it was so easy to understand we didnt bother with taxis again. (you can purchase a 10 journey travelcard for 7 euros which allows you on and off the train for ten journeys anywhere) EVERYTHING WAS CLOSE TO THIS HOTEL (but obviously not on the doorstep) ATTRACTIONS: there are so many things to see so ensure to ask reception for a map and get sight seeing ..the beach is only a short train ride away, le rambles is great in the day and even more fun in the night, sangrada familia is nice, picasso museum and loads more ..oh and lots of shopping. NIGHTLIFE: we ended up at an R'N'B club called JAMBOREE which was great and drinks were reasonably priced - a small bottle of wine (1 and a half glasses) was only 5 euros. Malibu and coke was 8 Euros. 10 euros to get into the club (it was well worth it but there are loads of peopleoutside giving out flyers for discount).

Maybe because of our high hope, it turned out to be a bit disappointed. Actually there\u2019re many areas that we like about this hotel: - location (just 30 seconds walk from the Urgell metro station) - neighbourhood area (the hotel is located on Gran Via, surrounded by many nice residential buildings along the street, seems quite safe to me) - There is an organic food supermarket called Veritis downstairs, very convenient if you want to buy some daily stuff - Comfortable beds, contemporary designed room & the flat screen TV - Free and private safety box embedded into the wall What we don\u2019t like about the hotel is that although the design of the hotel and the rooms are cool and funky, we think the designer / hotel operator only design it on an artistic perspective, many details & the service provided are not user friendly enough. - The corridors are too dark, feeling very depressed and not safe to go around - The maid do not refill the personal care items (like soap or shower gel) in the room even though we stayed there for 4 nights - The heating is not stable in the room and we always feel cold, given that the temperature is quite low in Barcelona in Dec - Not even a small bottle of water or a water boiler is provided in the room. Most importantly, there is a \u201csoft (blue)\u201d and \u201chot (orange)\u201d light design in the room. Probably part of the hotel\u2019s hip design. However, the light in our room is out of control from the 2nd night of our stay. The \u201cOrange\u201d light in our room automatically turn on every night at different times without touching any button. On one night it turned on at 8pm, on the other 2 nights it turned on at 12 midnight. Most ridiculous is, the light cannot be turned off even we push the \u201call lights off\u201d button. There isn\u2019t any switch. It can only be turned off if we took out the room key from door which cuts all electricity in the room, but then the heating will also be cut off. The hotel staff comes to our room and tried all buttons but they also can\u2019t fix the situation. They also said the system showed that everything in the room is normal. We can\u2019t sleep with that bright \u201cOrange\u201d light, so we need to change the room to sleep every night and go back to our original room in the morning. What\u2019s funny is, the hotel called technicians to fix it for us for a few times but the result is the room is normal every time\u2026 we don\u2019t have any explanation until the end of our stay and just bring back a lot of \u201cquestion marks\u201d with us\u2026 maybe we\u2019re unlucky, I don\u2019t know. This is our honeymoon trip, I think this ruined the mood of our honeymoon to a certain extent. I don\u2019t think it is a \u201cbudgeted\u201d hotel compare with the rate of similar hotels in Barcelona anyway.

I would be interested in trying other properties on future visits as well, but would recommend SoHo!", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHappy we stayed there\u201d", "Author": "Michael060", "ReviewID": "UR10000078", "Content": "We picked this hotel because of the Trip Advisor rating and the because it was seemingly a good value.

The rooms are a good size for a major city and cleverly-designed to make the most of space. The shower was excellent and the bed was very comfortable. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. Also, I thought room service and the minibar were reasonably-priced. Breakfast was really good too. The location was really useful - within 15 minutes we could walk to Las Ramblas, the Barri Gotic, and the Passag de Gracia (where many of the Gaudi buildings are). Also, it's only half a block from a metro station, where the airport bus also sets down. The best bit is probably the rooftop area with a lovely shady deck and a \"pool\" for cooling off and chilling out (more like a big jacuzzi though - you can't really swim in it). There were a few niggles - the sink and bath didn't drain properly unless we took the plug out. Also the noise from the park outside really intruded in the evening, since all the neighbourhood kids were playing there, very loudly. Thankfully they did all go to bed by the time we wanted to go to bed. But overall, I was really happy with our stay and would definitely stay again.", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast- Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cSoho was great !!\u201d", "Author": "ragga8", "ReviewID": "UR8708950", "Content": "My Partner and i were looking for a Gay Friendly Hotel in Barcelona and after using this website we decided on Hotel Soho and we were not dissapointed whatsoever! When we arrived we were warmly greeted by Allesio at the front desk..he took time to chat to us, ask us where we were from etc and pointed out some of the local attractions to us and even went so far as to show us where to go by using a map.Check in was fast and Simple and they had remembered some of our requests from when we booked the hotel on their website.We had a room with an inside view so wasnt really worth looking through the window, however we didnt mind and the rest of the room more than made up for it. The window blinds are controlled by a panel of switches on each side of the biggest double bed ive ever slept in! The mood lighting is also an interesting feature, again controlled from the same panel as the window blinds. There is a plasma tv with lots and lots of channels (tho a lot of which are in spanish not suprisingly) however there is BBC world etc available.The mini bar was a welcome addition after being out in the heat all day.The mini bottles of Champagne were a nice touch (only one glass in each of the 2 bottles tho!). The Bathroom was ultra - modern with the glass wall seperating it from the rest of the room, however there is blinds which you can close if you wish to (again by touching a button beside the sink! ) . ONE MAJOR FEATURE which i liked about the Soho is that the maids do not knock your door from all hours looking to clean your room...if you put the do not disturb sign on, they will be more than happy to leave your room until you leave, unlike a lot of hotels ive stayed in before. The room service is fast (within 20mins in our case) however the menu is very limited as you will find. We didnt use the downstairs resturant so we cant comment on what the breakfasts etc are like in the hotel. Another lovely part of the Hotel is the Rooftop seating area and plunge pool, its a great place to relax and although the pool is small, its still very nicely furnished etc (check out my photos!)/ All in all i wouldnt hesitate for a second in recommending this hotel particuarly to Gay/Lesbian couples i dont think its suitable for familys due to the layout of the rooms more than anything.All in all its a Trendy (but not 'in your face trendy' ) chilled out Hotel for couples more than anything When we were choosing a place to stay in Barcelona it was the reviews on this website that helped us choose this hotel.So if anyone has any questions about the hotel or visiting Barcelona for the first time please feel free to contact me.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery Chic\u201d", "Author": "BillyPinky", "ReviewID": "UR8707527", "Content": "Great place to stay, 10-15 min walk to center of town, close to the metro, very easy to get around.

Flat screen TV . air conditioning , it was a great room, every thing a city break hotel is meant to be. The bathroom has glass walls, you can watch telly while you shower. so not for the shy. We had breakfast as well and even the restaurant is ultra chic. In dark woods and the food is good.
