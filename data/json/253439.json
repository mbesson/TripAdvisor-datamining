We were given private use of the terrace for over an hour. It should be mentioned that the picture of the terrace is a little misleading because the majority of the terrace is blocked off because it is property of the Augustinian monks and we were only given access to that portion for 5-10 minutes to snap some beautiful photos. No big issue there though. The manager, Marina, provided great communication prior to the event, and even let us know when the sunset time was for that evening for optimum picture-taking. The terrace reception was great with prosecco and a bartender and everything. Then we had dinner in the Bernini room. A four-course meal with their private chef. It began with stuffed artichokes, then we had risotto on a parmesian crust, followed by a very nice beef filet with a special sauce, and finished with a chocolate cake with raspberries.

It was recommended to us by a business partner/friend who lives in Italy who stays there when in Rome on business. Once it was recommended I looked it up on TripAdvisor, and was dismayed at some of the reviews. First, the location; walk out the front entranceway and take twenty steps across a street and you are in St Peter's Square. Wonderful! The location was quiet, and we slept with our windows open without a noise problem. The hotel is not its own building; it shares a building with an embassy.. the hotel is on the third floor, and there is an elevator. The street entrance is a very nice small piazza, and the entrance door is locked and you must ring to be buzzed in. There are plenty of nice restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. The room: We did call to request a deluxe room after I saw some of the pictures of the room sizes. We were given Room 108, and we were VERY pleased. It was actually, to me, a small suite! It had two twin beds pushed together, a nice sitting area, and a nicely appointed although small bathroom. It was nicely decorated, the windows were tall and narrow and easy to open. The bathroom is a typical European bathroom; toilet and bidet, a small single sink with limited shelf space, a hairdryer that worked well, and a small tub with a handheld shower hooked to the wall. There was plenty of water pressure and hot water. For people making their way in Europe for the first time the bathrooms are most likely a shock as they are not American in any way. I personally like the difference, and I like the addition of a bidet. I don't spend a lot of time in the shower so the size isn't important. The beds were very comfortable and the linens very nice. The mini-bar in the room was well stocked with sodas, wines, beer, cognac, whiskey, and some small snacks. Room service was available from 4:00pm until 11:00pm. Breakfast was the usual European buffet... eggs, prosciutto, fruit, cheese, croissant, yogurt, coffee, tea, wine. We had a late night snack of minestrone, prosciutto, melon, cheese one evening that was very good. The hotel was furnished very elegantly, and the staff was professional, courteous and friendly. The breakfast room upstairs (there is an elevator) is very nice, and the views off the terrace are magnificent... you look right into St Peter's Square at the Cathedral. The price is right for the location; right on top of Vatican City. I think in fact it is quite reasonable for the quality of service and presentation afforded. This is Europe, and not America. I can see from some of the reviews that an unfair comparison is made because of this. I, for one, enjoy the differences I experience while in Europe... please feel free to contact me if you would like further information about the hotel or the area.

As for distances to attractions....St. Peters Square is literally across the street; it's about a 5 minute walk to the Vatican Museum entrance (minus time waiting on the long line); and less than 15 min walk to Castel St. Angelo.

It was a cloudless May evening and I had lured her onto the terrace for a late glass of wine. I couldn't have chosen a more romantic setting and as you can guess it went well. The hotel couldn't be any closer to the St Peter's Piazza and if you are feeling fit you are in walking distance of most of the sites in Rome (I had swollen, bleeding feet after 4 days but it was well worth it). The staff at the hotel are very friendly and polite (more than you can say for most \"Romans\" and I don't mean that as an insult but they are famous for it and boy do they live up to the stereotype). We arranged for the hotel's car to pick us up and there it was on our arrival to Rome - no waiting around - a very polite driver waiting to take us to the hotel in style (not inexpensive but I think it was well worth the money). As the driver turned into the narrow City streets I felt as though I had just passed through a time portal - the sense of history and the grandiosity of St. Peters is awe inspiring. The room in the hotel was very small (we didn't have a deluxe) but it was clean, well furnished and comfortable. After all, you don't go to Rome to stay in your room.

There were casement windows -- a delightful contrast to the sealed-in windows in typical modern hotels. I cannot speak for the other rooms in the hotel, but my experience was delightful. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful and charming. I felt safe (the front door is locked in the evening), and the location -- just off one side of Piazza San Pietro -- was incredible. We strolled right from breakfast over to the papal audience in front of St. Peter's. The breakfast room is particularly beautiful, and the buffet breakfast was ample and delicious. Service in the breakfast room was pleasant, but on the relaxed side. Not a big problem, as the more impatient among us could just walk a few feet and pour ourselves a cup of coffee. The view from the terrace is matchless. There are a lot of good restaurants in the area, and a taxi stand right across the square.

As this lady hasn't travelled since 1965 & has had a lot of illness recently, I chose the hotel on the basis that she would be able to see St. Peter's/Vatican from the hotel, AND have a nice looking hotel room - after all, the pictures of the rooms looked fine enough on the Residenzia Paolo site, and though not outstanding, I felt coupled with the location it would be a good balance. I was very VERY sorely dissapointed, no so much for myself as I travel a lot, but for the elderly lady who was so looking forward to her big once in a lifetime trip - This has to be THE tiniest room I have ever had the displeasure of staying in. The rooms are in my view around 2 star quality, and as the previous reviewer noted, the rooms show online are of the 2 suites that they have. Also it should be noted that this 'hotel' occupies the 3rd - 5th floor of a building, not the whole building. There is no 'concierge' to greet you at the door as shown online either - a small lane with a privately run gift shop on the left leads up to a nondescript door, and a chronically slow lift/elevator takes you to the 3rd floor hotel. At 270 euro a night you can see from my pictures what you get for your money - not enough room to swing the proverbial cat. The furniture, what little there is of it, is a dull looking utilitarian affair. When we 'separated' the 'twin' beds by 6 inches so that we could at least have the pretence of a twin room, I couldn't even open the wardrobe. The safe in our wardrobe didn't work. The minibar was did work however - and at 5 euro the one solitary mini bottle of red wine was consumed between us to drown our sorrows - there was some stronger stuff in there, but we had a long day ahead of us and as I said, my friend isn't in her prime anymore! The bathroom is virtually in the sleeping area - so you can hear all the comings and goings of your room mate inside the toilet whilst you watch the tiny tv - (only CNN and an Asian channel in English by the way). Most unpleasant. The bathroom is minute (surprise!) and again utilitarian with white tiles . They did supply the usual soaps/shower caps etc, but there's nowhere to store any of your own toiletries & it only contains a shower (no bath). There is no dressing table in the bedroom so if you were thinking of going out on the town, you'd have to do your preening in front of the mirror in the tiny bathroom. There is a hair dryer placed in a holder above the bidet (the mind boggles). The one bedroom window is impossible to see out of - very prison like - unless you jump up and hang on like an escapee you won't be looking out of the window at all. I did complain to a member of staff that I thought the room very small, but they said they were all the same being as it was a former monastery. I did look in at other rooms and they did have the same 'inmate' type appearance. You cannot go out onto the much vaunted terrace as someone else has noted - but to be fair you can see the top of St. Peter's, and at night it's quite a nice view (see pic) - but only a few seats (about 5 tables or so), so hopefully everyone in the 26 rooms won't want to sit at the side of the terrace at once. The breakfast was again 2 star. The service was very inattentive. There were two waitresses on duty when we arrived, & neither were serving anyone. Even though they saw us seat ourselves down, they carried on cleaning breakfast bits and pieces and ignoring us. Eventually I had to call one over to order tea. Later I asked one of them for some pepper - and after some 5 minutes I didn't get it, so I got up and got it myself from another couple at another table. The scrambled egg was cold and the bacon looked burnt. The toaster didn't do much toasting. The tea was ok though. There was also the usual cold selection of various cereals/yoghurts and so on. Back to the lift/elevator topic - there are two lifts - one to get to the hotel on the 3rd floor, and one for those who cannot climb stairs within the hotel to get to the next 2 floors. As I said, the lift to get to the hotel is chronically slow, but the interior lift is terminally ill. You have to press the lift button continuously to call the lift, and once inside the lift press your floor button continuously to get to your destination (you cannot take your finger off the button else it stops!!!!)....and it's slow... slow - SLOW - you wonder if you'll ever get out of there - and muse that perhaps you are in purgatory!. If they had advertised the true state of the rooms I wouldn't have minded QUITE so much, and my singular mark for them has been influenced by the deception that the rooms are so much better than they are, else I would have given them 2 marks. This isn't a hotel in my view - it's a guest house and they should jolly well say so. Really - my advice is don't bother with this hotel unless you really HAVE to be this close to St. Peter's/Vatican. The rooms in this hotel really only serve the true 'monks' amongst us!.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cNot as marketed on websites\u201d", "Author": "Conoula", "ReviewID": "UR5049557", "Content": "I decided to plan a 3-day trip to Rome through the internet. Unfortunately, despite its great quiet location (especially when one wants to visit the Vatican), the hotel disappointed me mainly because in most websites Residenza Paolo VI is presented as a luxury premier hotel. As you can see from the picture - this is not what people would describe as luxury! I was so disappointed when I arrived that I had to take a picture of the room! Its size was the size of a typical bathroom in other hotels! The bathroom was ok for one person, although very plain with just the basics. Of course in the hotel's web site they show their suite in the photos... The cost for this single room in the photo was 192 euros per night (low season). I thought that because I was travelling alone, they gave me one of their worst rooms for single use. When I returned and read the other reviews, I realised that apparently all rooms except the suites are in the same condition. Also, you could not see the promised view from their so much promoted veranda, neither could you see anything from the room window, which was located above my head (I am 167 cm tall) and I had to step on the bed to see outside! The hotel personnel was very helpful and nice and breakfast was great. It was fortunate that I only stayed 3 days.. and thank God Rome is such a wonderful and blessed city, with so many things to see and places to go!

The Paolo VI is literally across the street from the exit of Piazza San Pietro (St. Peter's Square). When we finished our exhausting and hot, but very worthwhile tour of the Vatican museums and Sistine Chapel, we literally walked out the exit, crossed the street and were in our room with our feet up within 5 minutes. However, this is a very expensive hotel with few amenities. We paid EUR340 for one night in a Deluxe room, including buffet breakfast and tax. (By the way, a Deluxe room is not the cheapest room. I believe the cheapest room was around EUR300.) Our room was totally charmless. It reminded me of a room in a well-maintained retirement home. The floor was light-colored marble, with three inexpensive \"Oriental\" throw rugs scattered about. The room's cherry furnishings were very plain -- obviously new but not particularly high-end. The only room decor consisted of two framed black-and-white prints of ancient monuments and a funereal-looking plastic flower arrangement. The only \"luxurious\" elements were the fabrics used in the drapes and bedspreads, which were obviously high-quality but not particularly attractive. The overall effect was cold and spartan -- I felt you could almost clean the room by hosing it down. The air conditioning was excellent. The bathroom was large and completely tiled in glaring white for that oh-so-warm mortuary look. It was more or less disabled-accessible, with a raised toilet and roll-in shower (no grab bars, though), which we had not requested but didn't mind. Amenities (soap, etc) were minimal and not very nice. What irritates me is that the room shown in their marketing materials looks NOTHING like the room we were assigned. While I realize all hotels tend to use their nicest suites for promotional photography, usually the decor bears at least some resemblance to a standard room in the hotel. Not so here! Another disappointment is the terrace, which is pictured on the hotel web site. It does indeed look like the photos. What isn't clear, however, is that the seating area is well back from the edge of the terrace (like 40 feet), and you aren't allowed outside of the seating area, which has a fence around it. From that vantage point can't see any of the (no doubt fabulous) view, except for the very top of the colonnades around the piazza and the clocks at the top of the church. I don't know why the restriction -- perhaps it's a security issue since the Pope frequently appears in the piazza? Whatever the case, while the terrace is beautiful, it was frustrating to sit where you couldn't really see anything! Additionally, the hotel's web site and literature says it has a \"restaurant.\" This is not true. There is a very attractively decorated breakfast room on the top floor that serves an extensive continental breakfast buffet each morning. (The food was good quality, with plenty of choices.) There are also sandwiches available for purchase during limited hours, which they will serve you on the terrace. That's it. No actual meals, no room service. The rooms have minibars and there is bar service on the terrace during limited hours. Both the minibar and bar service had very low prices for Rome -- around EUR5 for a glass of wine or beer, which is less than half what you normally pay at 4 and 5-star hotels in Italy. Bible verses are slipped under the door of your room each morning. By the way, the main clientele at the Paolo VI seemed to be priests and nuns. Are they also paying EUR300+ a night to stay there? I find it hard to believe. In short, despite the marketing hype, don't expect a luxury hotel.
