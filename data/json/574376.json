If you have unlimited budget you will love this place. El puerto was very good, dinner next door at banyan tree was incredible - that place has to be a 5.5 star property.

I cant see anyone not liking this place..its just a matter of what you want to do and spend. also the pool waiter was the best, we had same guy every day and he even got my key delivered when my room was not ready upon check in, and brought my little cooler to my villa when I left it at the pool.

So the front desk people, our wonderful \"butler\" Oliver, and the equally awesome driver who picked us up knew who we were, and treated us like royalty. The rest of the 700+ staff didn't, though, yet we found all who we encountered--from cart drivers to waiters to spa folks--to be not just smiling and engaged with us, but also happily engaged with their jobs. Many have been there since the property opened and most are genuinely proud to work in a top-of-the-line resort that also cares so deeply about environmental stewardship in a delicate region that has been trampled by rampant, questionable development. We were in a spectacular suite, one of the high end ones near the ocean, which we could see from the roof while soaking in our own private plunge pool. If I had it to do again, I'd make sure to spend more time there with all its wonderful resting spots, up top especially, but also from the long stretch of deck that overlooked one of the carefully engineered canals. It was huge, immaculate, elegantly and tastefully decorated, with incredible bathrooms (yes two!), amenities galore, and all those lovely outdoor spaces. The roof was simply the best! Meanwhile, I don't see much discussed here about WHY the Mayakoba was designed the way it was. No, it may not be particularly \"Mexican\" style-wise, but if you want to stay in a beautiful resort that shows off the natural environment, this is the spot. The canals follow natural underground waterways that were studied extensively before any ground was broken. The layout, with most of the resort set behind and intertwined within huge, healthy stands of mangrove, was done to minimize impact on these estuaries, something that too often happens with careless wetland destruction and overbuilding. (Note that a lot of resorts along the coast there have as many as 2000 rooms right on the ocean--this resort has a graciously planned 400, with most set back from the shore, nestled within the flora and fauna.) We were further impressed when we went on the excellent early morning canal tour and saw the abundance of healthy habitat and resulting bird populations everywhere. Fairmont Mayakoba was designed to live in harmony with its surroundings, and yes, that means a cart ride to get somewhere, or a few more mosquito bites than in other places, but I think it's worth it to be enveloped by nature like that. It's a truly serene place. Mayakoba also sources their seafood from a sustainable fishermen's cooperative in Punta Allen and even made roof shingles for most of their buildings out of recycled tires! All this was impressive to us--we love the peninsula and grieve the losses sustained by bad planning and greed. But we didn't have to feel guilty here. This is a class act all around--from a company that's been careful to preserve some of the natural resources that make the Yucatan a go-to destination in the first place. None of this would be much of a selling point if Fairmont didn't also provide excellent lodging and services. Food was very good (crab tostadas at the beach pool, mac and cheese with truffle oil in the Laguna restaurant--yum!), cart shuttles were plentiful, everything was immaculate. Love being greeted upon arrival with cold orange blossom-scented towels and delicious iced elixir too--details like this make it special. (Oh, and the spa is its own oasis that's really worth visiting.)

I travel often and feel I have a good base to write a good overall review. I'd also like to say I love Fairmont Hotels, I've stayed in several and do prefer them to other 5 star properties. Very simply this resort is outstanding. As longtime Premier members of the Presidents Club and having experienced many Fairmonts this very much lives up to the expectation. As for the negative reviews as I've said before look at how many hotels those people who give a negative review have rated. When someone mentions mold ect. THIS IS MEXICO! its wet, very wet. They cant do anything about it, its like saying its cold in Alaska. The hotel is LARGE. We were booked in a beach area casita suite and while being close to the beach was and the beach area pool was great, getting to breakfast in the morning sometimes required a wait for transportation. The grounds are very beautiful and kept very clean. The staff from transport drivers to reception to housekeeping all went out of their way to say hello and during our stay we were able to make it to all the restaurants twice, they always remembered our names upon return. As I said we had a beach area casita suite and it was one of the nicest appointed rooms we've stayed in while at a fairmont. When we arrived we had fresh flowers and a large fruit basket ( I believe thats because of our Presidents Club status) The room was about 1100 sq feet (living, bedroom, two large closets, two large bathrooms large veranda that spans the length of the room and a private rooftop pool and sun-deck! The since the pool was on the roof it was like bath water but it was very nice after the sun went down. Housekeeping did a great job, didn't miss a thing. The bed and linens were typical fairmont fabulous as well as the towels. We did loose our key one night, I thought to myself \"oh great, we're clear on the other side of the hotel\" after calling from one of the many phones around the grounds, not exaggerating we had someone willing to let us in our room within 1 minute and a replacement key within 5. How they did it? I have no idea and I really don't care I thought it was great! We were there with some dear friends who booked a Deluxe Casita and we were able to see their room and it too was great. It was basically half the size of our room but still very well appointed. All the restaurants are OUTSTANDING 5 star all the way! I'm a picky eater and didn't have an issue finding something tasty. The deserts were to die for :-). We did the breakfast buffet every morning and it was very good. Eggs, bacon & sausage was offered every morning along with mexican dishes. Fresh fruit and pastries along with made to order smoothies and omelets. Coffee and juice also included with the buffet. They also have a menu to order from, which is most likely what we would have done if the buffet wasn't included in our room rate. While the buffet was very very good I think $25/pp is stretching it, especially for Mexico. All the pools are kept in very good condition and towels and chairs are very plentiful. As I've experienced in other hotels many people believe that getting up at 5 am and reserving a chair with a shoe is an acceptable practice and then the chair sits empty for an entire day while other paying guests are unable to utilize it. This didn't seem to be tolerated here which I LOVE! All the pools have bar service and the service is VERY prompt. There is also a pool menu for lunch which was GREAT! The steak nachos a outstanding! Drinks are pricey but are inline with other 5 star hotels. Beers $5 mix drinks $10-$14. There is a store on the grounds which sells beer for $3. We had treatments at the spa. 3 of us had messages and 1 of us had a facial. All great. I've been to the Willow Stream in Scottsdale many times and based on another AT review I expected the spa to be the same. I sadly report its not. The rooftop pool was small, all the chairs were lacking the cushions which they clearly were built to have. The mens room was nice but the locker area also very small but the mens lounge was huge. The treatment room and staff very good and very much on par with other 5 star spas. I can say I went into it thinking it was going to be like Scottsdale and that following my treatment I could spend the day by the pool relaxing. This really didn't have the same feel and we left. I would still 100% recommend it for a treatment. We booked our transportation roundtrip via USA transfers it cost $80 TOTAL for a private car. Far less than what the hotel was quoting (I believe they wanted $110 each way) The transport was very clean, fast, friendly and english speaking. When we return I'll book through them again. My only areas that can be improved would be the transport in the resort. I think there should be almost a schedule that when a cart is at the beach that when its leaving another one is headed that way. On our final day we waited 30 minutes to get picked up for breakfast. Had we known it would take that long we could have very easily walked but it kind of got to the point \"I've waited this long I may as wait a little longer\". The other is Fairmont Fit. This is a program as a Presidents Club member, allows you to to have workout wear waiting for you in your room upon arrival. Whats great about this, is we don't need to pack the shoes shorts and shirts. For two adults athletic shoes take up a great deal of space. When we arrived to our room we had the shoes and shirts but no shorts. (please keep in mind I had this part of our reservation for over 2 months as did our friends) During our entire stay they never had any shorts! NONE! We made many calls but finally gave up. This was unfortunate because I had Khaki shorts and swimsuits none of which I could do my morning run in. While this doesn't spoil my view of Fairmont Mayakoba. I would have expected this issue resolved at some point during our week stay and had I known they wouldn't be able to accommodate our request I would have packed my own shorts. We did a day trip into Playa del Carmen, I didn't find it \"charming\" or \"cute\" at all. I found it very commercial and kind of dirty. There was 4 of us and we were offered drugs and Prostitutes several times and Cuban cigars about 100 times. While walking down 5th ave, people just scream at you to come look at their stuff. We counted about 20 Sunglass Huts and 15 watch stores. At one point we needed sunscreen and a very small bottle that would go for about $3 at Target was selling for $17.50USD. (OUTRAGEOUS) we were there durning the afternoon I can't imagine what its like at night. Had I known it was going to be like that, I could have passed on the experience. Overall will I return to this hotel? YES 100%! Actually we will be booking a stay in November this week. Overall tips. I would stop and get alcohol in town or through duty free. While our room was great, a room in the middle of the resort is more convenient and we rarely used the beach and beach pool because of the wind. The hotel is kid friendly, but they weren't everywhere (which no having kids, we liked). Our friends had the All Inclusive option for their stay and for them it was great, for us we still ordered what we were hungry for and drank what we wanted at the bar and saved $600 if we'd booked the AI option. (plus we didn't gain 15lbs) We didn't have any issues with bugs ( I live in the midwest and I know bugs) The dress code is very relaxed at the restaurants. When you get to this level of hotel most know how to dress to dinner. (men are fine in shorts and sandals) In the end you'll have an outstanding time! Happy Travels!

The stay was part meetings and part pure vacation. This resort is outstanding. The grounds are huge. They provide golfcart transportation, which comes in handy when you want to get to the beach or back to your room. There are also BMW bicycles that may be picked up and dropped off whenever and wherever you like. It is about a 5-minute ride to the beach. I would recommend riding all over the resort, including along the sides of the fairways of the golfcourse, perhaps later in the day when there are not many golfers on the course. It is a beautiful property, with lots of water and you are sure to see numerous birds and iguana - we also went up close to a crocodile and we also saw several cute cat-like rodents called guati. I would also strongly recommend taking the half-hour boat ride around the resort. You are in for some pleasant surprises, especially if you like seeing a variety of large birds. We ate at two of the main restaurants - La Laguna and Las Brisas - and were very very pleased with the service and the quality of the food. You can also pick up a lighter breakfast and excellent coffee at the coffee-shop besdie La Laguna. The only disappointment was that on February 14 - Valentine's day - for some unknown reason, La Laguna was closed for dinner, without any notification. That made it difficult to find a place to eat, given that this is an all-inclusive-type resort. That evening we ended up trying the Mexican restaurant on the adjacent Rosewood resort, called La Punta Bonita. This is well worth it. The food was unlike any other Mexican food we had eaten before. The hotel will drive you there in a golfcart, or it is an easy walk north along the beach. We walked back after dinner. The set dinner for two is recommended - go there on an empty stomach, because it is a lot of food. There are several pools on the resort, all with plentiful lounge chairs and towels. One of the pools has a built-in bar, with stools in the water. We recommend their margaritas and their signature drink, the Mojito. As far as rooms are concerned, we stayed in a casita - highly recommended, over a room in the main hotel building. If you can, stay in a second-floor casita. The ground floor rooms look onto swampy ground; the second floor rooms give you more breathing space and a more pleasant balcony experience. The rooms are very large, with bathrooms the size of most hotel rooms in the typical North American hotel. The rooms have wi-fi and it is free for Presdient's Club members. The reception was always fast. The swimming in the ocean is great, but there is no coral reef there. I swam out and saw some fish-life (and found a couple of golf balls). If you want some good snorkelling or scuba, you will have to go off-site.

As somebody who travels the world and is VERY discerning when it comes to hotels, that alone should say something. Last trip was Dec, '08 and I had such good memories that, when looking for a place to just relax and do NOTHING, this was my first pick. Before reading too far, let me respond to the consistent comments on the distance to the beach and around the property and the need to \"walk\". People! - have you become so lazy that you can't walk a beautiful path through Mexico to get to a beautiful beach!? First, there are bicycles EVERYWHERE that you could ride and if you're unable or unwilling to ride or walk, there are golf carts CONSTANTLY making the trip and there JUST for you! If this is why you rate this property lower, well, that's YOUR problem and you're probably overweight. I've become a fan of the Fairmont properties and the unique blend of local vibe coupled with generally great service. So, in quick summary; ROOM & PROPERTY: Room was a canal-side casita (recommend top floor if possible). Apparently I was upgraded to a different \"view\" because of my AmEx payment. Not sure, however, if the room itself was any different from other casitas but I did have a view of the canal and could hear the swimming pool on the other side of the shrubs. Again, guessing that ground floor rooms are not quite as comfortable. The bathroom was huge, the bed comfortable and the internet pretty reliable. There was always, also, plenty of bottled water provided. A casita by the beach would have been great too but then you'd be at that side of the property - away from the main structures. The gym/spa is large and well-stocked. As others note, highly recommend joining the Fairmont's President's Club for free gym access and wifi. Would love it if there were a few more standard English-language television channels but honestly I spent most of my time in the room just on the patio watching nature - seems that many folks do. One minor incident, however - during the trip, we had a pretty solid rainstorm one evening and I woke to find that there was a minor flood coming from the ceiling through the closet door and pooling in the bathroom. Upon calling housekeeping, they not only came to inspect immediately but then provided piles of towels to prevent it from continuing. It was a one-off but I can only hope that after I checked out they actually REPAIRED the problem so it didn't happen again. These things happen (and they responded accordingly) but wouldn't want to have been there for another week with this potential problem. I would say that there are a few water features (fountains) at the main swimming pool that need repair. Nothing major but, if not repaired, it may begin to be noticeable that the pool is getting a little beat-up. Pieces of tile here and there that is broken and a couple of dried-up fountains. FOOD: My room included the full breakfast buffett which was AWESOME - higly recommend getting a rate that does so. Was always able to get a table and the food is VERY good and exhaustive. As for other meals, lunch down by the ocean was alwasy solid with great service, poolside ordering was equally good (and quick). Of course, as mentioned elsewhere, meals can get to be a bit pricey and that was frustrating. Hard to get a drink under $10. I'm also happy to say that I ate raw vegetables and salads with no trouble (they clean things properly - no Montezuma's revenge!). There IS a small market that sells drinks, beer, wine etc. at a lower price but you can't get a margarita there. I guess that's the challenge of a resort. One frustration in this vein is that the market was initially stocked with sandwhiches and snacks but after a couple days, the stock was gone and one had NO choice but to spend $25-$30 on a meal. PLEASE try to keep some options in the market. Restaurants are great but with no ability to go off-resort, provide your guests some more options from the market. SERVICE: From the arrival at the lobby to the housekeeping staff to the waiters, hostesses and beach staff, EVERYONE was well-trained and very friendly - kudos. One minor complaint - I ordered room service a lot and, upon concluding dinner one night, set my tray outside my room and called for them to pick it up. Unfortunately, nobody did so and I was awakened later to two animals knocking over plates and trays and making a lot of noise. I called and asked that somebody please come get the tray and, again, nobody arrived. After the second call, somebody finally came and, in the morning, the area was clear. Shouldn't have taken this many calls but... OVERALL Given the ease of getting to and from the hotel, the service, quiet vibe, nice pool and pretty beach, this is definitely the place for you if you want a destination where there is NOTHING to do. If you're looking for a place with action, entertainment and music, this is NOT the place for you.

The restaurants, the hotels, etc. They all know they are in competition for the same guests. But what sets a hotel a part? When the guests start to behave with the great attitude that the staff has. I've never been to a hotel, anywhere in the world, where the guests reflect the attitude of the staff. The guests seem to be as eager to say \"hello\" and \"good morning\" as the staff...and that can ONLY be because from the top management down, the staff are eager to be of service and extra friendly. We had our entire bag of dive gear stolen from our trunk while in Playa del Carmen. Not only did the security people at the Fairmont help with the situation, but they drove us to the police, translated the story, and then went back two days later to the station to pick up the police report and deliver it to our room. Also, my husband had a birthday while here, and to our complete amazement, the staff decorated our room with flowers and balloons and delivered a birthday cake. Are we at a hotel? Or have we died and gone to Heaven? The rooms are amazing. And yes, the place is spread out. I overheard another guest saying \"The place grows on you\" when his friend was complaining about walking for 5 minutes to get to the restaurant or the pool. If you are seeking a resort where you can go down 40 floors in the elevator and walk out to the pool...this is NOT it! Here, you walk out of your beautiful room into a community of well designed buildings with 4 units each, people coming and going, and of course, the jungle. You can walk, bike or take a golf cart (which are plentiful) to your destination. The servers at the beach area amazing...flying around with food and beverage in the air ...keeping everyone happy and greet you by name after one visit. The restaurant servers are terrific. Even the drivers of the golf carts are caring people. I asked one server, German, out at the Playa restaurant if he was the manager because he was everywhere helping guests. He said \"no, but I look for places to be of service.\" That seems to be the overall training of the servers...look for where you can be of help...and they are. There is always something that may not be the way I'd like it to be, and this case...it is the temperature in Las Lagunas restaurant. FREEZING. Who wants to eat with a jacket on?

The breakfast buffet at La Laguana had a great spread including different local cuisines every morning. They make smoothies, eggs and even quesadillas to order. For the healthy, there is even a separate \"fit\" food station. Lots of fresh fruit and different juices are available each morning (we had the buffet every morning for 4 days). A very kid friendly resort. Kids 5 and under eat free (best chicken fingers ever), the kiddie pools are heated and their is a kids program for ages 4 and over. Staff is extremely friendly and are very considerate with kids, even the golf cart drivers would remember their names when greeting them. The resort is large but there are golf carts running 24 hours a day. Most we ever waited was 5 minutes - but most of the time, a cart would be coming within a minute. There are also bikes throughout the resort which you can use to get around - however I noticed people would hog bikes and park them outside their room instead of leaving them at bike stations.

Unfortunately, there are a limited number of beachfront rooms, none of which were available during our stay. The beach area was nice, but the weather was too windy and the water too choppy to enjoy. We spent most of the time by the main pools where our children enjoyed the water slide. Adults should make note that the slide is meant for children as I ended up injuring myself when I picked up too much velocity coming down the slide. We did not take advantage of the spa, as we found the prices too high, more so than similar treatments at high-end U.S. hotels.

In contrast, the hotel proved an oasis of peace and luxury. We had a beach-area casita room, which had a lovely view of the lagoon (a crocodile was sunning itself just outside our terrace one day). The bathroom was fabulous (seat in the show and deep soaking tub); and the room sufficiently big. The private butler was a nice touch - we tasked him with babysitting, restaurant reservations, late check-out and a taxi to Chichen Itza, all of which was sorted for us. Plus he personally came to collect us at check-out and drove us to reception - the bell boy had already been booked to take our luggage there. Nice touch. Whilst others have slated the food, our experience was that is was excellent. Las Brisas is a fabulous restaurant - we had several great meals there. Stunning amuse-bouches and petits fours! The staff were excellent with our young children too - we arrived in Las Brisas tired and hungry with the kids not realising it was 'fine dining', but they took everything in their stride, produced crayons and colouring paper for me son and rapidly served them bread and pasta to keep them going. Excellent. We also are at La Puerta and had delicious steaks. The beachfront is lovely but yes, the sea is rough and it is windy! On a couple of days when it was cloudy, the wind made it rather chilly to lie out. You can't snorkel which is shame and there are no watersports, but that may please some looking for peace (as we were). The main pool area is stunning with lots of nooks and crannies, plus a flume. Kids club seemed good, although we didn't use it much. Some nice little touches like the free boat trip round the lagoon - made for an afternoon trip with the kids. Plus we liked that they provide an unstocked fridge in the room and don't fill it with over-priced minibar items - they leave it to you. And as for the golf buggies to transport you everywhere - our son loved them! Totally exciting. Overall, we enjoyed it. Yes, it's expensive. And not perfect.

The food at El Puerto was truly great and the staff try really hard to accommodate your needs. Special praise to the manager of El Puerto, she was brilliant. The breakfast selection at La Laguna is vast and delicious, that coupled with the location is a real winner.

We have stayed in many top notch hotels (various Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, St. Regis around the world) and none compare to the service levels that we received at Fairmont Mayakoba. We stayed at the beach area casita that came with butler service and every staff we encountered (not just our butler) was super attentive, welcoming, genuinely friendly, warm and helpful. We've stayed at other hotels with butler service too, they don't even come close to the levels of service at Fairmont Mayakoba. Perhaps it's not just what the staff do for you, but also the demeanor and personalities of all the customer facing staff here that incredibly service oriented. Too many examples, but a few key instances that stand out: (1) my husband hurt his foot and was limping throughout the vacation. Almost every hotel staff that he met asked him if he was ok, what they could do to help, etc. And when they saw him again, would ask how his foot was doing, if it was improving. (2) there was a mess up with one of our restaurant reservations and it ended up we could not eat dinner in the restaurant of our choice one night, so we settled for a different restaurant, La Laguna. We were at the concierge when all this happened and my husband just mentioned by the way that its too bad that La Laguna did not \u00a0have esquitas on their menu as he was really looking forward to having that at our original restaurant choice. I think one of the restaurant managers or GMs overheard his comment and suprised us with specially made esquitas for dessert! (3) our butler always seemed to know where we were during the day and would pop by to see if there was anything we needed, e.g. dinner reservations, car rental, organizing trips out to see the Mayan ruins. Other things about the resort: -\u00a0it is very spread out but easy to get around. There are lots of golf buggies traversing the resort for you to hop on/off. There are also free bicycles all over the place. - we went there in December and were worried about whether the pools and sea would be warm enough to go in the water. Not a problem. The sea was calm and warm enough to play in. \u00a0Some of the pools were heated, though not everyday it seemed. Or maybe they only switched on the heat the last few days of our stay. -loved our beach area casita that was overlooking the river (its beach AREA, not ON the beach). The river view was very serene and quiet. We would definitely come back here, not just because it's a beautiful resort but the compelling reason really is the superb service!!

The resort was beautiful! The rooms were very spacious and beautifully cleaned everyday. The staff were fabulous- so warm and friendly and really could not do enough for us and our party (there were 13 of us all together in our party!) especially the beach guys, the staff at the spa and our friend's amazing butler Olivier. The beach was clean and the kids spent everyday there although I must mention that it is a red/yellow flag beach all year round so the sea is rough and there were a few days that the children could not go in. There were no watersports due to this which was a shame for my teenage son and his friend, and I think therefore they need to put on more activities on the beach to keep them occupied-they did have either a football game or volleyball match most mornings but this really isn't enough. I had a few private yoga classes- David was the best teacher! The spa was fantastic! I had 2 massages which were excellent and a treatment called 'The Food Of The Gods'- ladies I highly recommend this!!! You are wrapped in melted chocolate then showered off, followed by a massage in coconut oil then given a large slab of delicious chocolate to eat! What more could a girl ask for?!! As far as the Christmas festivities go, in the hotel's Christmas timetable it said that Christmas Eve Father Christmas would be paying a visit between 3-5pm! I took my very excited 4year old daughter to see him at 4:15pm to be told he came at 3pm and sorry we missed out! My daughter was absolutely devastated, they took our room number and after complaining a couple of times nothing was done! I know for a fact that most 5 star hotels would have done something to make it up to her, e.g. a small surprise toy on her bed that night or something, but nothing! We ate in La Laguna Christmas day night, which was our favorite restaurant overall, it was a Christmas buffet, which to be honest was very 'Budget Buffet' and disappointed us! There was Turkey but with no trimmings! I ended up having Mexican which was delicious but others in the party were not happy! Overall the food was awful! Every night we booked our table for 7:30pm and did not receive our starters until 9:15pm at least, and the food was not of a good standard! I don't know if it was the size of our party that made them so slow , but thank goodness the restaurants weren't ever full as we'd probably still be waiting for our dessert now!lol One of our party got food poisoning and was ill for 5 days and two more had bad stomachs from the food. In a 5 star resort you expect 5 star food and in this hotel it definitely was not! It is such a shame as apart from the food, this has everything a 5 star resort should have, just the food lets it down! New Years Eve we had dinner at Las Brisas which was probably our best meal. We had the private dining room and our waiters were fantastic ( Alexander and I sorry I can't remember the other gentleman's name!), it was again a buffet and the food was yummy!

Away from the all-inclusive crowd!\u201d", "Author": "zrh2yvr", "ReviewID": "UR122847281", "Content": "You must read this review!!!! I hope the words of this review live long and near the top of the reviews of this hotel for a long time. This resort is amazing and as a very seasoned traveller who has seen some of the best this world has to offer, the resort has just provided a memorable experience. After months of deciding what type of vacation / resort to go to for a short 5 day break, we finally decided to go to the Fairmont and forgo the all-inclusive which is typical in this region. We are so happy we did!!!! We stayed at the end of the Christmas Peak and arrived on January 1. The resort was over 90% booked and remained that way for the duration of our stay. The resort has over 400 rooms and can host over 800 people. The resort has a lot to offer everyone from families with children, to couples, to seniors. Based on the size and facilities available, you can always find a place that will be what you want. We really never could tell there were 700 guests (and really probably 300-500 staff). This review will be comprehensive so sorry if it\u2019s a bit long. 1.) Rooms \u2013 There are 2 main room types. The rooms in the main building (These would be the Fairmont room and deluxe room) and there are rooms in the Casitas. The quality of the rooms is very good. We stayed in a Casita but I am sure the rooms in the main building are also great. Almost all the Casitas are the same size \u2013 they have 2 levels with 2 units up and 2 units down. The suites are usually on the top and they have the size of two rooms combined. Whether you have a Signature casita or not is likely just the location. The Signature casitas are overlooking the canals / lagoons. We had a Siganture Casita and it was great. Nice big bathrooms with windows. Given the privacy of the second floor, the shower and bath are essentially outside but are covered so you get all the natural light from the windows. Beds are typical great Fairmont quality. 2.) Beach v. Not at the beach. The beach is a 7-10 min golf-cart ride away. There are rooms / suites etc at the beach \u2013 all in casitas. Some are larger oceanfront signature casitas that have private pools. Each level up is more expensive but if that\u2019s what you want \u2013 it is available. We did not have a room at the beach but ultimately we were fine with that. If your main goal is to get up and be on the beach every morning \u2013 you may want to get a beach room as it will be more convenient for accessing your room / beach. There is one large pool at the beach as well as the signature restaurant \u2013 Las Brisas. If you stay back in the property away from the beach it is like being in the jungle a bit. It is very private and the casitas are very spaced out. The main breakfast restaurant is in the middle as are the five or six main pools. There is also one adults only pool if that is what you are looking for. It is the largest single pool and you could do lap swimming there easily as it appears to be at least 30 meters across. 3.) Food \u2013 There are 3 main restaurants and we ate at all of them. Prices are high for Mexico but you get what you pay for and the quality is good. The breakfast buffet is amazing and any way you can get a rate to include breakfast \u2013 it is worth it. Separate cost of breakfast was $25 each. We never ate lunch all week as the breakfast was so filling. 4.) Drinks - After a week in Mexico City staying at the St. Regis and paying what appeared to be a pretty high price for drinks \u2013 the Fairmont exceeded this price level by about 20%. If you are a big drinker and are looking to go away to Mexico in order to have 20 shots of Tequila per day \u2013 this place will break your budget and you should really go to an all inclusive resort. However- if you are trying to be away from those who are drinking 20 shots per day \u2013 you will find the guests at the Fairmont much better to be around. 5.) The vibe / crowd etc. The guests are refined, international and the kids on the site were under under control (for the most part!). There is no single country which seems to dominate the guest list and so for those of you who have possibly in your past vacations felt that you were just around a bunch of (insert nationality here) - - that will not happen here \u2013 at least it did not for us. 6.) Service \u2013 The staff have really been well trained to provide the Fairmont Royal Service. You can sense that each member of the staff feels it is their responsibility to keep the guest happy. This is from the check-in to the pool, valet parking, bell desk, housekeeping, maintenance, security, transportation and restaurants. Many of the staff feel very proud to work at the Fairmont and you can see it shows. 7.) Value \u2013 There are 3 hotels in the Mayakoba area. Banyan Tree, Rosewood and Fairmont. The Fairmont is definitely the lowest cost. We did not see the other resorts in detail but in looking into them, the other 2 are definitely a cut above in terms of the style, size and expense of the rooms. If you want only the best and are willing to pay for it \u2013 The Fairmont can offer you the Signature beach front suites and these will compare with anything at the Rosewood or Banyan Tree. I would expect that the other 2 resorts will have fewer people and perhaps more of a celebrity and very wealthy crowd. 8.) Other amenities \u2013 The Fairmont has other facilities such as the Willow Spa (we did not use), the Golf Course (Which is world class, meticulously maintained and beautiful). There is also a gym which has all the equipment and facilities you need including a whole separate room with yoga mats. There may be a fee to use the gym but we did not use if. 9.) Packages \u2013 Rates at this location are always changing and the types of packages they run seem to change a lot. Go to the Fairmont web site for latest. I do not know which wholesalers have access to the rooms but we used the Amex Platinum desk which has this hotel as one of the Fine Hotels and Resorts. They do occasionally run an all-inclusive which is comprehensive but has some limited restrictions (i.e., no all-you-can-eat fois gras and likely some restrictions on which alchohol brands are included). They also have all-you-can-golf pacakges which I would definitely take next time if available as the course is expensive ($200+ per round). In terms of cost \u2013 It is approx. $100 per person extra for all-inclusive when it is offered. This is a good option if you feel you will drink a lot. Overall \u2013 remember this is not all-inclusive unless you get the package. However, you will get a better experience, generally much better food and a crowd that is not rowdy. This place is relaxation, privacy, and has exceptional service. It has great facilities and lots of space to find your own corner. I\u2019m sure in off-season you\u2019ll feel like the only guests. This place is not the uber-luxury hotel like the Banyan Tree or Rosewood. it is also not a party hotel for your college spring-break getaway. It is also not cheap but it is good value for what you pay. Thus, if you are looking for the cheapest place, you will likely not be happy here and will find the costs (especially the food) expensive. However, if you have a decent budget to spend on vacation and want a great experience, this place will meet your criteria. One final note \u2013 if you are a frequent traveller and have stayed at the Fairmont many times in your travels, you will feel a sense of faimiliarity in the Fairmont and the staff make extra efforts to make you welcome. They know they are part of the Fairmont family and make the effort they can to welcome you \u2013 especially if you are a President\u2019s club member.

Be warned that there is a dress code, but La Laguna accepts casual clothing. The other restaurants require pants, shoes and a collared shirt for men...you might be able to sneak through slightly under-dressed. Food is extremely over-priced on the resort (one banana for US$2), and it'll set you back about US$60 for a round-trip to Playa del Carmen town with a hotel-approved cab (well-worth it just to spend some time on 5th Avenue!). Do not bother going to Las Brisas or El Puerto Restaurants. The service was ridiculously slow. As for El Puerto, the waiters and staff were also utterly incompetent. Despite repeatedly insisting that our party not be fed anything which contained alcohol, pork, or meat, the waiters served a dish which - yes - contained pork. When they served it, they were specifically asked if it had any meats or alcohol, and they said no - which was totally untruthful as we later discovered after eating them, much to our horror. Similarly, on the beach (part of Las Brisas' services) our party - one of whom was pregnant at the time - ordered non-alcoholic drinks. We again specifically and repeatedly checked with the waiter that he would bring us drinks without alcohol, but of course they couldn't get such simple requests right, and after taking sips of the drinks we realised that they were in-fact alcoholic! The apologies were quite inadequate, once we extracted them. I have to say that the one redeeming feature about the resort is the \"Travel Agency\" and a most helpful young lady by the name of Synda. If you're willing to pay hotel prices for activities such as Scuba Diving or excursions to nearby Excaret, the service was absolutely fantastic and probably well worth the extra cost. By the way, if you're looking at scuba diving, the dives leave from the hotel north of Mayakoba (about 30-45min walk along the beach). The dives sites are quite spectacular. If you arrange diving from the stores in Playa del Carmen, you will save about US$40 on two-tanks.

On the same property are two other hotels the Fairmont and the Rosewood. The reception desk at the Banyan Tree recommended El Puerto at the Fairmont. It is advertised as a steakhouse. This is a terrible restaurant in every way possible. The reception desk had to cajole the hostess at Ei Puerto to accept our reservation for 7:30pm on December 20th. When we arrived the restaurant was only half full and remained so for the entire evening. The decor consists of bright white walls and bright lights. With a lady singer singing karaoke style 1960/70s music. The terrace is better but unfortunately the mosquitoes like it too. The terrace looks out on a fountain with a huge (2 or 3 story tall) white Christmas tree with red lites. It makes one feel you are in mall of America. Service was disorganized and felt like our waiter and busboy were 2 of the 3 stooges. Getting water, a a glass of wine and bread literally took 35 minutes. Then we placed the order. We were told that the national beef was \"outstanding\" and ordered steaks rare and charred on the outside, asparagus and to start salads with dressing on the side. 20 minutes later the salads arrived drenched in dressing. We accepted the salads since we were starving. 45 minutes later our steaks arrived well done and not charred. The waiter left the asparagus and told us it would be 15 minutes and we would have our steaks. 20 minutes later after asking about our steaks twice we were told the kitchen was very busy since it was the Christmas holidays and the manager would see us. Another 5 minutes and no manager. We asked for our bill. It was 80 dollars without the steaks and included a 15 percent service charge. No apology.

I complained to the reception desk at the Banyan Tree and they told me they would notify the manager at the Fairmont. We never received any response from El Puerto or the Fairmont.

The nightly rate for the basic room was $429.00/night and that included food and beverage for two adults and two children under 5. We did have to pay the additional $15/person/day resort fee which was added to our bill. I am first pleased to report that we received an amazing upgrade to a Beach area Casita Suite, we very much enjoyed the room top pool/hot tub as it was a nice way to end the day. Thanks to the management of the hotel and the previous GM for assisting in following through on a promise made a few years ago!! The package was very good value in my opinion. The package included Laguna restaurant for breakfast and you could either select the buffet or order off the menu. All drinks, juice, milk, etc were also included as part of the plan. Lunches were available at Laguna or Las Brisas, as well as both pool or beach service which gave you access to all venues that were open, including all day and night access to the lobby lounge for drinks and food. As far as dinner, Las Brisas and Laguna were included at no additional cost. They did have a couple items on the menu (lobster items) that were an additional $10 cost if ordered so you were always able to order off the entire menu. Wine was by the glass and we found them to have a sufficient selection. You are also able to eat at El Puerto for an additional $25/person I believe. We did not have to pay as Las Brisas was closed on the Saturday night for a wedding so they switched our reservation to El Puerto at no cost. I paid the additional $10 and had the lobster from Saan Kiam, which was good. Once again, at El Puerto, no limit on number of any appetizers except the foie grois. I was able to order a nice mix of fresh oysters flown in. Bar service was available throughout the day at all bars and restaurants including the beach and pool service. The cocktail selection was wide ranging, only certain cocktails were not included such as some of the signature fairmont cocktails with high end champagne and cognac. As far as beer selection it appeared you could order whatever you wanted, I am a fan of Modelo Especial which I cannot get in Canada so stuck with that. The only confusion seem to be with bottled water/sparkling water. Although not charged additional for anything, I thought it should have been clearer what all was included as on occassions I drank, perrier, pellegrino, and cristal mineral water as well as Bonafont. Anyway, service was very good and taxes and gratuities were included. On several occasions we added to the tip as service was exceptional. Some staff knew more about the new plan then others and were able to explain things better, however, it was never really an issue. As the hotel was only about 30% occupied, there didn\u2019t seem to be that many people on the AI plan, however, I would recommend it to anyone if offered again. I believe the cost for children between 6-12 was $50 or $75 additional a day, however, the package also includes three hours of kids club activities per day. Anyway, would definitely do this again as I enjoy the property, and with suite upgrades, I believe it is a great value.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coral Gables, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice and sofisticated casitas!\u201d", "Author": "ourplanetisbeautiful", "ReviewID": "UR121865201", "Content": "lush foliage outside the casitas, which have every amenity inside, feels like you never left home, except that you are in the Mayan Riviera!", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, California", "Title": "\u201cSO relaxing.\u201d", "Author": "Vagabond76", "ReviewID": "UR121814820", "Content": "This place was magic.

I travel worldwide and have traveled to Riviera Maya for the last 25 years. I have never paid more for a resort hotel. Given that the price was so high (probably a poor negotiation by my company...) the access to meals and activities was limited. While I was in the meeting they did not let my 16 year old son eat at the beach restauant, even though I paid $120 extra per night to have him stay with me, so he had to skip lunch. This was unneccessary and mean, certainly not what I consider luxury. They charged me extra for a cappucino with breakfast and they offerred me a champaigne cocktail and then told me that it would cost extra. The meals were standard (good) international hotel fare, nothing too exciting. The rooms were very nice but extremely far away from everything... a long walk to the beach, a long walk to the pool and excercise room. There was NOTHING to do there. If you are sedintary and wish to stay in a nice room in a mangrove swamp, then this hotel is for you. If you want to have an excellent time in riviera Maya, go to Akumal. By the way, the Fairmont Mayakoba also freaked me out a little because there were literally hundreds of people working there compared to just 100 or so guests. All of the workers were obviously trained to say hello to the guests which gave me the creepy feeling that they were like slaves for us rich folk.

The Fairmont Mayakoba won, and I feel like we made the absolute perfect decision. A very big thank you to the staff across the entire resort: from the restaurants, to the spa, to the beach and pool areas, the font desk and concierge, to the housekeeping and cart drivers... everyone was better than perfect. Everything you may read about the hospitality, attention to detail, quick response, and positive attitude are all true. Amazing service and the entire staff had a 'can do' attitude. We stayed in a Signature Casita with the breaskfast package... The room was amazing, quiet, very clean, with an extremely comfortable bed and a huge bathroom. We could not have asked for more. I would certainly recommend the breakfast package- severed till 11:30 am so we did not feel rushed if we wanted to sleep in, and had basically every gourmet breakfast offering we could ask for. One thing we were concerned with before going (and asked several people about) was the beach. Was it too small, too loud, too far..etc... It was just want we wanted.. white sand beach, clear blue water, plenty of space, safe enough to leave our things unattended to go for a long walk or swim, and well attended by the beach waiters. I actally liked the fact that you had to take the hotel carts to the beach (like a 4 minute ride) through the mangroves to get there... made it feel like you were traveling through the jungle to arrive at a private and secluded beach. The Willow Stream spa is also amazing. We spent two afternoons there, just lounging by the spa pool and using the facilities. For what we were looking for (quiet and relaxing time), it was just what we needed. Again, like a broken record, the staff was attentive and very welcoming. Cannot tell you enough how perfect this trip was. The management and staff certainly deserve a big pat on the back. We will certainly go back to this amazing place.

We had arranged for airport pickup through the Fairmont concierge, and even though it is pricey, having the private drive in a plush and spacious Suburban was a welcome oasis after a cramped and full flight from Canada. The drive to the resort takes about a half hour along a modern and well-maintained highway. The entrance to Mayakoba is striking. Three luxury resorts share the Mayakoba grounds - The Rosewood, Banyan Tree and the Fairmont. Having visited a few other resorts in the Riviera Maya, I can say unequivocally that the grounds and hotels in Mayakoba are exceptionally well maintained and landscaped. Checkin was quick and efficient. Golf-cart style shuttles run regularly between the lobby and the beach. The bulk of the hotel infrastructure is located far back from the beach to maintain the ecological integrity of the fragile dune and mangrove environments. Our Signature Casita was located on one of the canals, and featured a spacious bathroom well-supplied with toiletries. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The large balcony had two comfortable cushioned chairs and we spent our mornings listening to and watching the numerous bird species that inhabit the area. The fish in the lagoons seem to be well-conditioned, as a dozen or more would appear beneath the balcony as soon as they heard the screen doors close! My only complaint about the room was that the two wicker chairs are not comfortable for sitting to read or watch television for extended periods of time. We had purchased the full meal plan (which included all drinks) and were glad that we did as meals tend to be expensive. The quality of the food, preparation, presentation and service are all of a high level, commensurate with the prices. There are three restaurants at the Fairmont. We regularly had breakfast at La Laguna in the centre of the resort, the only restaurant open for breakfast, save for the deli cafe. There are many options to choose from, including traditional breakfast items, many Mexican specialties, a large assortment of fresh fruits, eggs made to order, smoothies, and hot meat entrees. I eat gluten-free, and the chefs were able to accommodate that with specially-made muffins, cookies and bread (best gluten-free french bread I have had to date). You do however, have to order these the day before. Lunch for us was normally at Las Brisas which is on the beach. You can also obtain food and drink service right on the beach. Las Brisas has a great selection of Mexican specialties. The wait staff are all genuinely friendly and warm. Dinner is available at all three restaurants. El Puerto which is located in the reception building, specializes in seafood and steak. Our favourite restaurant was Las Brisas because it is right on the beach. In the evenings it tends to be quite windy and cool at this time of the year. At night the lights bordering the walkways are quite dim in order to create a more natural environment for the birds and animals that inhabit the area. If you are intending to walk after dark, rather than riding a shuttle, a small flashlight may come in handy. The beach is beautiful with well-manicured white sand. The island of Cozumel is clearly visible on the horizon. Parasailing and jet-skiing are very popular. You can walk for miles along the beach in both directions strolling by adjacent hotels. We took a day trip to the Mayan ruins at Coba. We had organized this through the onsite travel agency Maritur. There was apparently some confusion about which tour we had requested - we thought we had booked the private tour, but ended up on a group tour in a cramped 12 passenger bus. Ensure that both you and the travel agent understand what it is that you are purchasing. The ruins were very crowded. The largest temple at Coba can still be climbed, but we understand that this will be allowed for only one more year. Every element of this vacation was enjoyable and relaxing. I simply can't say enough about the wonderful staff. There wasn't a person that would pass us without a cheerful Hola or Buenos Dias. Wait staff would go out of their way to make us comfortable and welcome. Shuttle drivers always asked how our day was going. Evening entertainment was professional and enjoyable.

We have stayed at many a Fairmont over the years, and this was absolutley one of if not the best stay at a Fairmont we have ever had. We had arranged for airport pick up when I booked this back in March of this year and I never remembered to reconfirm pick up. We realized this on the flight down and said ok, either they are there or not and no worries. Well, they were there and waiting for us with a private vehcle and cold water. Perfect and off to another great stay at the Fairmont. My husband is a Presidents Club member etc and we received an upgraded room on arrival that came with a Butler, Elio. We were upgraded from a Lagoon View Suite to a Beach Area Suite and it was great and came with a lovely balcony with a view of the lagoon and a roof top view of the ocean. We had coffee out there every morning ( on the lagoon view balcony) and watched the birds and it seems with all the peace and quiet ( perhaps due to the trees that were there and the way the architects laid it out) that we were there all alone in our own private world. It was fabulous and exactly what we needed. We had the breakfast buffet every morning and it was well worth it. The property also has three pools and other activities and a person could come for a stay and never leave this beautiful place. It is also really nice that all of the employees say good morning, afternoon etc as you walk by and many take the time to learn your name. This is typical of Fairmont Hotels but they do an even better job of it at this location. The golf cart transportation is brillant and often if an employee sees you waiting they will call on the radio for a cart for you. I don't think we ever waited more than a couple of minutes for a cart if even that. Back to Elio our Butler while we were there. We can't say enough good things about him, just a nice person with a can do attitude for everything we inquired about and one day when I found something my husband and son wanted to do and it appeared to be sold out, all I had to do was to call him and voila, tickets were available in ten minutes and all we had to do was to pay for them and show up on time. Also our trip back was changed and he handled all of the changing to the return trip to the airport to catch the flight home. We were on vacation and I did not have to mess with it and I loved it. I also used the Spa and found the services to be very good. Also, like most Fairmont Hotels, they have a car rental desk in the property. We rented a car at the hotel for the duration of our stay as we wanted to do a bit of touring but not on a tour bus and not only was the rental price better than out in town, but complementary valet parking is included if you rent a vehicle on site. I could go one and on about our perfect stay but the best thing was this morning. As our flight home had been changed by the airlines and we had to leave the hotel at 4am to get to the airport on time-ewww. Elio arranged to have the staff come up to our room to get our bags at 3.45am and ride the cart back to reception to check out. They were there at 3.45am on the dot with smiles on their faces and our teenager realised at that moment that he had forgot his perscription sungalsses in the rental vehicle. Those were retrived with no issues or any \" I guess we can do it for you\". I was simply, oh, I have all the keys to the rental cars at night, one person said and it would be his pleasure to get the glasses which he did and it did not hinder our leaving on time.

I prefer Fairmont properties, as they are always first class, but the Mayakoba is just an amazing place, it far exceeded my expectations. We were picked up in a private Cadillac Escalade for our transfer from the airport, and the ride was quick and enjoyable. We were greeted in the lobby with cold towels and sangrias, and check in was a breeze. The property is breathtaking, a perfect balance of class and culture, very modern yet there were touches of the old mayan civilization, and I cannot rave enough about how fantastic and beautiful it is. From the natural lagoons and wildlife, to the pristine beaches, I was never disappointed with my stay here. The service was the best I have ever experienced, and the food and drinks were amazing. The bartenders were wonderful, and the waiters attentive, very quick and always smiling. We stayed in just a basic Fairmont room, and although I was able to upgrade being a President's Club Platinum member, but there was really no need, our room was beautiful. The beds were amazing, the decor modern and high quality. We had a private terrace overlooking the lagoons, and we saw so much wildlife while just having morning coffee, the green iguanas were my favorite. The resort offers golf cart chauffeurs to all the lobby,different restaurants, lounges, pools and the beach, I never waited more than 5 minutes for a ride, as well the property offers a wonderful free boat ride through the lagoons, and we saw even more wildlife, including sea turtles,cormorants and crocodiles, and a myriad of different tropical fish. We did a spa day, massages, mani's and pedi's, and again, amazing service! As well, you have access to all the spa amenities for the entire day, so again you get much more than what you pay for. This resort is not an all inclusive, and some might feel it is expensive, if that is the case, there are many all inclusive hotels in the area, and those properties are much better for the people who worry about prices, although they do have sales here on the off season and you get far more than what you pay for.

In our opinion this hotel is totally overrated. For a hotel in this price range there are too many shortcomings. Let\u2019s go into detail: 1.) Value-for-money ratio The welcome was a little bit cold and was more or less an introductory speech to understand all the additional charges that were about to happen to us: - 15 US$ per day and person resort fee - 100 Pesos per day for valet parking - 10 US$ per visit of the fitness center - 23 US$ per day (!!!) for WIFI-use; this borders on insolence. Every other modest hotel we visited during our Yucatan-round-trip offered this service of course for free, but not the so-called \u201cupper-class\u201d and \u201cluxury\u201d Fairmont-Mayakoba-Hotel. All these additional costs for partly obviousnesses must not be for an AAA 5 diamond resort. 2.) Location The hotel complex was very spacious. Advantage of this was the silence; Disadvantage: long distances to the pools, restaurants, beach, exit, \u2026 . To surmount these distances you can use bicycles (for free !!!) or the shuttle service with golf karts. The bicycles, if available, are really high grade (BMW: hub grade, Magura hydraulic caliper brake, suspension fork) but unfortunately bad serviced. I didn\u2019t have a single properly working bike (brakes, shifting system, slack splashguards, \u2026). The shuttle service with the karts was really well organized and the staff was really strived to minimize the waiting time. Compliment to the kindness of the drivers and their good service. Clean and nice pool areas but no showers. Clean and beautiful white-sanded beach, but uncomfortable beach chairs. Because of the great distances to Puerto Morelos or Playa del Carmen (City) you need a car or you have to use taxis if you attempt to escape the high-priced Fairmont-Mayakoba-restaurants (with a very different quality). 3.) Sleeping quality Very comfortable beds and cozy bedclothes. No noise or other disturbances. Only the air condition could be less noisy. 4.) Rooms Well spaced and also very cozy but very dark because of the trees next to the terrific big window. In reply to my request for a brighter room there was immediately the question of an additional charge. Because I told them, that I\u2019m not willing to pay more money for a room with bright daylight, they needed more than one and a half hour to check for another room. After this time another room was offered, but it was absolutely similar to the first one, although the Mayakoba was filled only to 40%. Thank you to the management for this outstanding performance. As for the rest we had a problem with a bedside lamp (was solved very fast) and during a rain shower there was a small waterfall in the bathroom, because the top side of the bathroom window was leak. On closer inspection we saw, that there must have been several attempts to tighten the window frame with silicone. The odor in the room was a little bit musty, but in my opinion that is caused by the high humidity, closed windows and air-condition. 5.) Cleanliness At first sight ok, but upon closer examination there was a lot of dust on the furniture, lamps, shutters, ceiling fan and in every nook and corner. That is unacceptable. The shower head in the shower should be exchanged. 6.) Service Altogether the service staff was very attentive and zealous. On the weekend we had long waiting times for the breakfast. We had to wait for more than 15 minutes to get a table and again roundabout 10 minutes to get a fried egg or an omelet. That is unacceptable. But I think this was a management problem. They didn\u2019t considered, that there would be a lot of weekend tourists. One time a table reservation was forgotten. After a short discussion why the reservation was not in the system, we were requested to wait in the hotel lobby and take a drink. We considered this an invitation due to the messed up reservation but this was a misunderstanding. We had to wait for 20 minutes and the tab was on our own account. That must not be and is no customer friendly crisis management. It is the succession of trivialities which are unacceptable for a so-called AAA 5 diamond resort.

The night of our arrival we went for dinner at La Brisas by the beach. Although they close at 11 PM, they were quite reluctant to serve us when we got there at 10:00 PM.

The Casita was decorated with flowers on the bed in the shape of a heart with rose petals leading to the bathtub which was also pre-filled with bubble bath and rose petals. Tiny flowers spelled out \"Felicidades.\" Amazing! Later that night we got a knock on the door and were given a fine bottle of Merlot in celebration of our anniversary. Enough said. The grounds of this property are amazing. There is a man-made canal which meanders around the property. If you reserve the boat 24 hours in advance it will take you for a cruise around the property. 12 passenger Golf carts will pick you up and take you wherever you need to go. Food at the restaurants was very good, but I would have liked to see more authentic mexican dishes on the menu. Property was only 10% occupied so we virtually had most of the pools (and there are many), all to ourselves. Pack your insect spray as you will get eaten alive by mosquitos. I sprayed OFF any time we went down to the pool or out to dinner and I was fine. As with any property there were some spots of missing paint. Epai wood on some buildings that needed slight repair, pool tiles missing in some spots, but for the most part this property deserves 5 *****.

When we arrived at the Mayakoba we were entranced from the moment we entered the front gate. The tropical foliage, understated elegance, and casual, but classy design made us reel with excitement for our stay. We stayed in a Deluxe Casita with a King bed and it was perfect. With a cozy bed, large outdoor deck, and sizeable bathroom we knew we would be comfortable. Not being on a canal and being on the second floor we had a good bit of privacy unlike the rooms on the canal and first floor. We took advantage of the bikes and golf carts that are available to guests as part of the per person resort fee, which were very helpful in getting around to all of the parts of the resort. We didn't have any problems with the frequency of the golf carts and saw them running often and didn't have to ever wait long for their arrival. The bikes were a fun change of pace and everyone seemed to enjoy them, but you soon learn that they might not be waiting for you when you needed them again. There were MANY pools and options for guests to lounge. They don't monitor the \"adult\" pool on the canal very well and children and teens often visit the space because it's the only infinity edge pool canalside. The \"adult\" swim up bar is another place that children visit and order and play and splash, which makes it a little harder to enjoy your cocktail. The beach pool area gets pretty busy since it's the only pool at the beach, but we didn't ever have a problem getting chairs. We pretty much ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner there for the 3 days we stayed there and every meal was delicious. On our first night we signed up to do the cooking classes, making Arrachera with one of their chefs - I highly recommend it because it was super fun and a little something different. We had everything from empanadas, to fish tacos, to ceviche at their restaurants and it was all amazingly delicious. We also had dinner at La Puerto, their steakhouse, which was very tasty too, we ordered Steak & Lobster, and sides including the macaroni and cheese, I get hungry just thinking about it. I could rave about the grounds of the hotel, the staff, food, and views all day. The only complaint I have is their lack of interest in keeping the kids out of the \"adult\" areas and with plenty of pools (I can remember 6 pools) it would be nice to have some adult space for those not traveling with kids. I would recommend taking the nature tour as it gives you a better appreciation for the ecological component of the resort. We would go back in a heart beat!

There are also a few bikes to alleviate the problem but they are insufficient. My advice: don't travel in rush hours and you'll be fine.

We stayed for a week for our Honeymoon and could not have been happier with our choice of location. We had high expectations, knowing the quality of Fairmont experiences, which were exceeded by the excellent service. So many of the staff went above and beyond their regular duty to make our stay pleasant. Arrival We were greeted immediately upon arrival with cool drinks, told by the concierge that he had been waiting for our arrival and that we were his VIPs. We were then upgraded from a hotel room to one of the Casitas. Check-in was quick and easy and they provided a golf cart shuttle to take us to our room. Our luggage arrived promptly after we did. The Casita (Room) The view from our balcony looked down onto one of the canals that connects the lagoons and we could see Hole 8 of the golf course across the water. (We were later told this was a frequently requested room during the PGA Tour, as guests can watch the play from their room). The room itself was beautiful, spacious and cool. Large shutters allowed us to close out the light and sleep in during the mornings and nap in the afternoons. We enjoyed much of the wildlife that lives in the natural habitat, including fish and a crane that apparently lived in that area of the lagoon. Pools and Beach Both the pools and the hotel beach were pristine and offered bar service. The staff always set up chairs with towels and were prompt with ordered drinks. Getting Around Getting around was easy, the golf cart shuttles came by every 10 minutes, often sooner. Bicycles were readily available at an abundant number of locations. Property Tour We enjoyed the complimentary boat tour of the Fairmont Mayakoba property, and were encouraged to learn that the 45 acres of the hotel development had actually restored an entire Eco-habitat. The abundant wildlife included several species of birds, iguanas, geckos and even small alligators. The water is pristine and the hotel property is beautifully landscaped in a network of canals and lagoons. Food and Dining All of the restaurants on the property were deserving of their 5 Diamond rating. The food was delicious, the service was good and many of the staff remembered us by name after dining there just once or twice. Vibe The resort was full of vacationing families (mainly local Mexicans) and visiting corporate groups. The hotel had a nice social buzz about it, but never felt crowded or unavailable. Spa We splurged on a couples massage at the spa, and were glad that we did. Purchase of a spa treatment also gains you a full day access to the spa's mineral pools, steam rooms and jacuzzis. Activities and Day Trips We very much appreciated the in-house travel agent who helped us book several excursions for great prices and with savvy knowledge. She helped get us the best deals and listened to what we were looking to experience before making recommendations. We paid for tickets right at the hotel, so there was no waiting in line upon arrival at the destinations. Several of the packages included food and transportation. A bus would come pick us up at the hotel, and we would stop at several other resorts and hotels to pick up fellow tourists. Guests staying at other locations were always breathless when pulling up to the Fairmont property, and we had to agree, it's hands-down the jewel of the Rivera Maya. There are so many activities and sites to see nearby, the history and culture are amazing. We were able to visit Mayan Ruins, snorkel, enjoy eco-parks, cave dive and see cultural shows. Honeymoon Extras We were treated with special little surprises in our room nearly every night of our stay there for our honeymoon. Our first night we arrived to rose petals on the bed, with a trail into the bathroom where a bubble bath with rose petals in it was drawn, and robes and slippers laid out. Other nights included chocolate dipped strawberries, a bottle of champagne, notes from our room attendants wishing us a happy honeymoon and even towels folded into a pair of swans on our bed. (We were not charged for any of these \"extras\" and had not even requested them as a honeymoon package.) Generous Hospitality On our last full day at the hotel, I had a conversation with one of the employees in the Cafe Maya and mentioned how much we had enjoyed our stay and loved honeymooning there. To my surprise and delight, she knocked on our room door that night and had brought an arrangement of flowers and a HOME-MADE card wishing us a happy honeymoon. She said that since we had thought it was so beautiful there, she wanted us to have a memory of the place to take home with us. We were very touched at the thoughtful and gracious hospitality of the staff. Returning and Recommendations We will return as soon as we are able to this lovely location. We highly recommend it as a honeymoon location, or just an enjoyable place to vacation.

The hotel is beautiful and is set in a eco friendly atmosphere with large rooms they call \"casitas\" We booked our trip from Expedia and when we arrived we were shocked to see so many people, that's because there was a huge group there and the hotel was full. When we got to the front desk and were checking in we asked if we could have our rooms together as we had our 4 children with us. The front desk person said \"even better, since we are full we will move you to the beach where you will have better access to everything\" My wife booked a superior suite with a canal view and when we herd BEACH, we thought great, they are giving us a nice upgrade. Well, turned out that we were close to the beach, but ended up with jungle view, or no view at all. That was really the only glitch in the stay. One night while we were having drinks in the lobby bar we happened to mention this to the girl serving us drinks, as we were curious as to the different sizes of rooms etc... She in turn brought over the front desk manager, Guillermo, and we explained to him what happen with our room change. He was very nice and explained that the front desk person on duty thought maybe we would be happier closer to the beach and was very apologetic and said that the intention was not made to make us uncomfortable. We were ok with his explanation. Dinner the first night was great, but very expensive, 500 usd for the six of us, but the service was good and so was the food. Be prepared to spend allot while dining at the hotel, although breakfast was included. The staff were very nice and always had a smile and were very helpful and attentive. It was a place that we really enjoyed and will return again some day. The kids had a blast and were always enjoying the pool area as they have a water slide as well. We had 2 rooms and they were big and well decorated with huge bathrooms and shower area and a nice size terrace to sit out, just don't get jungle view.

The pool area is usually a pretty accurate barometer of the type of resort you're at, and here, it's clear, it's a family oriented place. There is an adult pool, as other reviews have outlined, but they didn't compare to the neighbouring hotels we visitted (Banyan Tree and Rosewood). That said it's the cheapest of the 3. There are bikes, and shuttles to get you around the large resort. We're a pretty athletic couple but in the blazing heat, you'll be happy to have the option of a ride. Even if you're on your way to the gym.. Which we did check out. As FPC members, we got to use the facilities for free. It's basic, but it's got everything you'll need. I think they even offered some classes. In terms of food, we ate at El Puerto, and weren't blown away. Service was good, but the food wasn't memorable. Or worth the price.

I just have a hard time describing how much I enjoyed my experience at the Fairmont. The property is absolutely beautiful. As the resort description states, it is beach, mangrove and jungle. We reserved a signature casita and it was very beautiful with a big balcony over one of the lagoons, a very comfortable bedroom and a big marble bath, with a picture window looking out at a walled jungle garden. From the time that we arrived, we were treated beautifully by the bell men, the people at the front desk ,and the guys who bring your luggage to the room . My original plan was to spend most of my time in Playa and pretty much just sleep at the hotel, but that really changed quickly. After a couple of days I did not want to leave the property at all. The beach area was really nice and clean, good beach with palapas and lounge chairs. The resort pools are magnificent. The master pool complex is really huge with all kinds of different areas for sunning reading and relaxing. The adult infinity pool is placed over a large lagoon. I sat there for hours just watching the birds and feeling really gad to be right where I was. We ate at all three of the restaurants and enjoyed them all. One evening we sat at the bar at Las Brisas restaurant (at the beach) and had dinner at the bar with a clear view of the lights of Cozumel across the water. It was amazing. We started most every evening with drinks in the lobby. The ladies in the lobby area took fine care of us (thank you Mariana and Carina ) and we enjoyed Melonie who played Alicia Keyes style music on the piano and sang in a most relaxing manner. Her music was perfect in this Caribbean venue. Transportation around the resort is by foot, by bicycle (they are everywhere) and by golf cart (they circulate through the resort constantly always ready to take you from lobby to the beach or anywhere between). The guys who drive the buses are friendly and courteous. If you have stuck with me this far, I have something else to say about a couple of the earlier posts. Yes, occasionally you have to wait a few minutes for a golf cart to the lobby or a cocktail on the beach, and I did not mind at all. Maybe we are getting a little too used to a \"drive through mentality\". I saw parents using the time waiting for the shuttle to show their kids stuff about the plants on the property; waiting for a drink on the beach I always have my book to read, or can just look around ( and looking around is pretty super). Maybe a vacation is a good chance to slow down a bit, and if that bothers you, maybe it is more your issue than the hotels. I loved this trip. This property. These people.

I've never stayed at a bad Fairmont, but I was concerned after reading many of the negative reviews. However, we had a wonderful experience and this property fully lives up to the Fairmont brand. Check in was very smooth and we started out our stay in a Casita with a jungle view close to the main building. Our casita was great - spacious and beautiful. We could walk to the main building, to the family pool, adult pool and Laguna restaurant from our location. As expected, the resort is very spread out and we had no problems finding a bike, or getting a ride in a cart if needed. The service at the pools, beach and restaurants was perfect -attentive but not intrusive. When we arrived there was a large group at the resort, but servers were running up and down the beach making sure everyone was happy. We had a problem with a water main and unexpected construction behind our room and because of that they promptly upgraded us to a beach area casita -which was truly spectacular- it came with a rooftop pool and a butler! A special shout out to Mario Martinez who handled the situation so quickly and made our vacation so special. Food was priced similar to other Fairmont properties I've visited. (Overall Mexico is much more expensive then I remember. 2 slices of pizza and a coke at the airport will now run you $20 dollars!) In light of that I think the pricing was on par for the area. The 'El Puerto' restaurant was my favorite \u2013 in particular the sea salt encrusted ribeye, and don't miss the short ribs in merlot sauce - they were spectacular! We only went into Playa one day - it was 40 dollars round trip in a taxi- so if you plan to go frequently you should rent a car from the airport, or from the travel agent in the hotel. We had dinner one night at the Banyan Tree thai restaurant and the setting is beautiful - very pricey, but worth it. My boyfriend played the El Camaleon golf course and loved it \u2013 challenging and with beautiful scenery. It is also worth taking the boat tour of the resort, the lagoons are lovely and we saw iguanas, birds and an alligator.

The Conference facilities were top notch, the common area's especially the lobby and entrance ways, are impressive. The hotel and other neighboring Hotels have done an excellent job in preserving the envirorenment, which is a rich lagoon full of wildlife. It is a must to take the free boat ride along the Lagoon, it is free. But, you must reserve it in advance 24 hours. I read earlier reviews of complaints that the Resort is so huge, but the fact is it's not that big of a deal, because their are golf carts that do round the clock rounds to help people go from station to station, plus Bicycles are free to use at no cost. My wife and I ate several meals at the pool restaurant and the Beach restaurant, and I found the food to be \"OK\", not bad not great. Service can be slow, but avoid the problem by not eating at peak times. The resort makes it's $ on booze which is highly priced, but any traveler know's there are ways to avoid that issue.

The food is also delicious and the grounds stunning with something green everywhere you look. The golf carts to pick you up are quick or you can hop on a bicycle for a short, leisurely ride....it is so different from any other resort in Mexico, and we had been to many of them. We spent 8 months planning our events and activities for our wedding with Lino Simonin, a Wedding Coordinator at the hotel, and he made everything smooth and seemless. He responded to emails very quickly, had every single detailed outlined, and made everything so easy under the usual stresses of wedding planning. He was the BEST! Wilberth, our butler, was also amazing! He greeted us everyday with a smile and was always ready to assist with any task (which there were many when we neared the wedding day). He was friendly, and even made us a sweet card at the end of our stay with all of our guests signatures and a special note. He spent the time to make it the most memorable day for us, as did Lino, and we are so appreciative for that. Brides....if you are looking for an amazing, unique, romantic setting for your wedding day...this is it. I looked at every single hotel from Cancun to Playa del Carmen to Tulum and the Fairmont Mayakoba is absolutely the best pick.

I was traveling with my husband and daughter. We had booked several months ahead and were hoping for the best. On arrival at Cancun airport , we were met by a wonderful driver arranged by the hotel. He was ready for us with cold wash cloths and chilled bottles of water. The ride was about 40 minutes in a brand new SUV. As we entered the lobby, we were greeted with a welcome drink and escorted to the front desk. Check in was quick. Our room was a Signature Casita located about in the middle of the resort near \"The Island\" ( a pool, cafe, restaurant complex). We were first floor and had a balcony overlooking the lagoon. The balcony was large and had a table and 2 comfortable chairs. We were able to see boats as they would float by and lots of fish that would swim up to greet us whenever we walked out. The room was a bit larger than average hotel rooms, featuring the most amazing bathroom! 2 sinks with plenty of storage, an oversized glass door shower, and seperate tub. Behind the tub was a floor to ceiling glass wall that looked out to a small garden with a privacy wall behind it ( beautiful at night with the lights lit). There were 3 restaurants to choose from. We had lunch and dinner a few times at Las Brisas at the beach. The food was a nice selection of salads and sandwiches for lunch, and a varied menu for dinner. We had our buffet breakfasts ( which were included as part of a package) at La Laguna Restaurant which was on The Island. Wonderful selection of hot and cold foods, good variety. Dinner here a few nights was enjoyable. The third restaurant ,El Puerto, was located in the main building near the lobby. My husband said it was the best steak dinner he has had in many years! There were 4 or 5 pools to choose from around the resort. Although the entire complex covers a huge area, you can choose to walk, bicycle, or be driven by golf cart. The paths are well maintained and easy to navigate. The bikes are located in several areas where you can take one and leave it at your destination for the next guest to use. The golf carts are continuously run by the staff, picking you up and delivering to your desired spot, whether the beach, pool, a restaurant, or the lobby. They were always going both directions and we never waited more than a minute or 2. Often times we were stopped while walking and offered a ride by a passing cart. Now about the service...I had read many poor reviews and was wondering what we would find. Well, I must say I have been to many hotels and have seen the good and the not so good. This staff was by far the best, most professional and courteous staff I have ever encountered. From the bellmen upon arrival ( and each time we left and returned to the resort) to the concierge staff ( most helpful with travel advice and finding allergy medicine at a local pharmacy which they had shipped to our room). The housekeeping staff was always friendly when we met them out and about, and graciously returned to our room 3 nights to do turndown service after we missed them on their rounds. They even delivered flowers and set up an aromatherapy bath for my daughter when they knew she wasn't feeling well. We were treated to a very nice bottle of red wine left by the staff one night. The restaurant, bar and pool service staff was equally exceptional. They met us and walked us to our beach chairs each day, setting up umbrellas and towels to make us comfortable. Drinks were brought quickly when requested, although we were never interrupted by the bar staff. The restaurant staff would greet us by name at each meal and were very attentive and friendly, always willing to talk with us a bit if we engaged them in conversation. Each and every employee that we would meet while out walking would greet us with a warm and genuine smile, many times asking \" Is there anything I can do for you?\". There were a few bands and music groups that would perform nightly at the restaurants They were a nice back-ground touch. If you are looking for an active party atmosphere, this is not the place for you. You are surrounded by gardens, trees, mangroves and lots of peaceful areas around the resort. Wifi is available by all the main public areas, and is free if you sign up for Presidents Club, also free! To get to Playa del Carmen, you must take a taxi which is about a 15 minute ride. There is not much to do at the resort but relax, read, work on your tan and connect with family and friends over great food in a beautiful setting. Back home to reality now.

Arrived at 4pm to a nice cold towel and small welcome drink, but then had to wait an hour for room to be available and were offered nothing in the meantime. Booked into Deluxe Casita Room, on the positive it was a very good size with extremely comfortable beds, and a really nice bathroom. But on the downside definitely had the musty smell I've seen many people refer to, the \"view\" was of jungle vegetation literally a foot or two away from the patio. Felt very claustrophobic. Also poor use of the ample room - small table, enough room for one to dine let alone four. Big wide open spaces which would have been better with shelves, drawers etc for storage. The resort is very large and you have to get the bikes or buggies everywhere. Problem with buggies is there are just never enough of them, and of course everyone waiting forgets their manners at home and just push to get on the first one that shows up. \"Oh I didn't realize you were waiting too...\". No I just like hanging out at buggy stops! And the problem with the bikes is the same ... not enough of them at each stop, people just take them and lock them up. I also could not find one bike that did not have something wrong with it. Service at the beach was excellent. Very prompt, very proactive, very efficient. Service at the pool was shockingly bad. Took half an hour to attract one pool guy. Took a very complex order - two Coronas. They NEVER showed up! We went back to room maybe 90 minutes later having not seen a single other pool service guy. A new world record for me. Lifeguard was similarly missing in action. He would show up when it was all little kids and stand there and bark for them to wait their turn on the water slide. Then when a gang of 15-16 year old teenagers showed up and started bullying their way round, pushing in front of everyone on the slide, blocking the water, stopping other kids play, he was nowhere to be seen. Food is generally very mediocre. I get better Guacamole in North Carolina. I really wish I was exaggerating, but I am not. La Laguna is all middle of the road mush. El Puerto is nice if you stay off the main steak/fish menu (the duck and short rib were truly excellent). I had filet one night and it was very bad. Over salted under cooked (since when is medium rare completely uncooked for 80% of the meat?) Service was intermittent - some of the staff were truly outstanding, others right down the other end. Very inconsistent. I will say in La Laguna on my daughters birthday the service we got from Rocky was outstanding and a highlight of the entire trip. He treated her and us like royalty. If only they could hire more like this! There is nowhere in the main building to eat lunch. So when we came to check out I had to get on a bike to go to the store to get us something so we could eat before leaving. Absurd. And yes I did have to push hard for the 1 hour late checkout, explaining we were checked in 2 hours late and our room never got made up until 4pm every day. The property itself is very nice. The pools are excellent, the kids pool a lot of fun with a good size water slide. And the beach is very nice, though quite rocky and quite narrow.

The resort is beautiful from the minute you enter thru the huge entrance from the highway and get's better with each minute up thru the winding driveway to the resort main building. We were greeted by our sur name soon as we exited our VIP shuttle and then given cold hand towels and a refreshing drink. Check in was under 2 minutes and we were immediately escorted to our suite by Aldia (not sure of the correct spelling). He explained the resort and even brought our luggage so we didn't have to wait for the bellman to bring it. He was extremely polite and a true professional. The suite was the nicest we have ever stayed at and having traveled the world and stayed at Ritz Carleton's etc that is saying quite a bit. If you have the option, upgrade to a suite and you will not be let down. Within 5 minutes of being in our room our butler Oliver knocked on our door and introduced himself and explained that he is available for anything we need, reservations, cars etc. We truly feel that Oliver was one of the highlights of this stay. He was incredibly polite, professional, attentive and all around a great individual. He would find us at any of the pools, beach or restaurants throughout the day just to see if we need anything, make reservations for dinner, schedule cars and or follow up on a previous request. Oliver and Hayde (Fairmont President's Club Manager) even sent a wonderful bottle of wine to our room for my wife's birthday. If the hotel management reads this and the other wonderful reviews mentioning Oliver please promote him! The resort itself is huge, beautiful and relaxing. You actually forget where you are and feel like it's in the middle of nowhere. The main pool is one of the nicest I have ever seen, pictures really don't do this resort justice. If you stay at this resort make sure you spend at least one night at the Lobby bar and have a cocktail overlooking the resort. The only negative things I can say are that service at the pool bars was very slow and service by the adult only pool was almost nonexistent. Also prices for food and drinks are high for Mexico and on par with Miami, New York etc. All said we are planning to return end of June for our anniversary!

The property and facilities were beautiful. While on site, we stayed in both a Fairmont View Room and a Signature Casita Room which was secluded away from the walkways and overlooking the lagoon. While the Fairmont room was very nice, the Casita was extraordinary. Although only about 30 square feet larger than the Fairmont room, the Casita seemed much larger and much more elegant. The bathroom was considerably larger, with an expansive rain shower. The balcony was also about 1.5 - 2 times larger. The property grounds were well maintained with walkways leading through the surrounding jungles and mangroves. There were three main pool areas on the property. Unless you are staying on the beach, the beachfront is about a 10 minute walk away. But there are a number of available bikes and golf carts will also shuttle you around the property for free. The one complaint is that there was no hot tub on the property. There was a smaller hot-tub area with large bubbles, but the water was only slightly warmer than the swimming pool. For a resort this size, a hot tub is a must. The biggest complaint about the Fairmont is the service at its restaurants. While on site, we ate at every restaurant--Las Brisas, La Laguna and El Puerto--eating lunch and dinner at both Las Brisas and La Laguna and dinner at El Puerto. The service is spotty to say the least. While the waiters and staff are extremely polite and welcoming, there were many times when we were ignored by the staff. At times when we would first sit down it would take 10 minutes before a waiter would appear to take our drink order. There were other gaps in service during the meal. The staff also did not deliver the food in the correct order. For example, we would always get an appetizer and at times, the main course appeared before the appetizer--many others at the hotel also noted this problem. It got to the point where we would have to specify that we want our appetizer served first, then our salad, then our main course. The quality of the food was very good, although Las Brisas and La Laguna offered many of the same items. Still, no complaints about the quality of the food. Another disappointment, however, was the wine available. Generally, each of the three restaurants offered the same bottles of wine with some variation. And the prices on these bottles of wine were marked up considerably--I'm used to seeing 200%-300% mark ups at restaurants, but here 400%+ mark ups were the standard. Bottles that you could typically find in stores for $12-$20 were going for $65-$100. Higher priced bottles weren't as egregious, but still bottles found in stores for $60 were going for $230. And to be clear in my review, while the service at the restaurants was spotty, the service by the housekeepers, bellmen and rest of the staff was excellent. Whether you needed a ride to the beach or an extra towel for your room, the staff was prompt, professional and courteous. Besides these couple of issues, however, we had a wonderful time. And even though the hotel was relatively full when we first arrived (there was a large convention there), the property did not seem crowded (probably due to its large size). We were always able to grab a spot at a restaurant without a reservation and there were plenty of lounge chairs and towels. Other than the spotty service and high priced wine, our trip was terrific.

In the morning we sipped frothy and flavorful mexican coffee which we prepared ourself in the french press, and looked out over sparkling clear water with colorful fish, ducks and birds. A morning USA today delivered to our door. We ate at each of the restaurants and enjoyed live music everynight. The food is diverse, fresh and healthy ingredients and inventive. No buffets at this resort. Attentive and friendly staff are everywhere on the resort. Bike racks are supplied with 5 gear BMW style mountain bikes, and guests can take the bikes anywhere at anytime (except night) throughout the resort on the many several pathways that stretch about a mile from the hotel lobby to the beach. We also used the shuttle to visit the companion hotel - Banyan Tree - which is an architectural marvel. You can dine at restaurants at Banyan Tree and Rosewood. Cart shuttles take guests all around the resort. There is boat service along the waterways to several docks. The rooms are equipped with cooler, separate tub and falling overhead showers with direct sunlight in the bath. Bathrobes, slippers are also provided. A flat screen TV and also a Bose radio. cd player. Bring your CDs. There were many families at the resort, but kids we saw were well behaved and not at all a nuisance. We stayed at the adult pool area. A lady at the beachfront restaurant was rolling cigars, I enjoyed one after dinner for about $12 usd. This resort was likely more expensive than other resorts in the area, but I found all the costs were reasonable compared to US hotels and restaurants. Dinner at the resort cost about the same as dinner at one of the better restaurants in our home of Cleveland; comparably much less for those coming from NY or Chicago.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cSome good, mostly bad...\u201d", "Author": "mstill", "ReviewID": "UR100167464", "Content": "I stayed at the Fairmont from March 5 thru 11th. In my room was my wife and I, in another room was my mother in law and our two children ages 3.5 & 6 months. I will start with the bad as it outnumbers the good. BAD: Service and Food. Now, this is not an all inclusive resort so you are paying out of pocket for each meal. It is not cheap either, they are wacking you for $10 a drink if not more. $4 for a can of soda. The breakfast buffett is $25, dinner for 2 will be $120-150 at either of the 'sigunature' restaurants and that is on the cheap side, if you get fancy with the wine (which was not very good wine btw) sky is the limit. The food was also very basic, as good as any all inclusive I have been to in the area and I have been to a few (Aventura, Sandos, El Dorado). Now, I do not generally expect great food at an AI, but when you are paying your way I expect it to be better and it simply was not, it was just basic. I have a problem paying those prices for average fare. Next is the service. I was shocked given there are probably 500 employees standing around the joint, no one bothers ask if you need anything. The first day we sat by the beach, not a single server looked in our direction for about half hour. Eventually we started asking and a few just walked by. We finally got a drink order in and that took another 20 minutes to receive. This was just the beginning. We ordered room service, took 1hr to get an order of chicken wings. We called reception, would be put on hold for a few minutes. I asked for the porter to come get our bags the day we left, it took almost an hour. Sitting by the pool, rarely a server at all. What was worst was when I called to complain or ask for service there was always an excuse, no 'Im sorry were busy\" but instead I got \"that isnt my section\". What makes no sense is given you are charging per drink or meal, the smart thing to do is be over attentive with the service, you make more $$ the more drinks you sell, so have a server all over me offering drinks. To be totally honest, these problems in no way ruined our trip. We had a great time overall, but when you are paying good money for a 5 star facility I expect better food and service then the typical all inclusive. GOOD: The hotel grounds are spectacular. Very beautiful place, great to ride a bike around or just stroll. The beach is excellent as well, many hotels will lie about their beach and not tell you its full of rocks but they do have a pristine beach. The pool area is great, very clean and big enough so you do not feel cramped. The rooms were about the best Ive ever stayed in and the one service area they had right was the room cleaners, they were excellent. The bathrooms in particular are great. We had a signature casita for the wife and I, the rest of the family was in a Fairmont room which was also quite nice. They were also very good about the carts that drive you around from spot to spot on the grounds. remember, you do not stay on the beach (unless u pay for the beach casitas which are a few grand a night) so you need to get a ride or bike to the beach. This was no an issue. I thought the distance to the beach might be but it was not. All in all I would not return to the Fairmont Mayakoba due to the quality of food and service however it was not a failed vacation. We had a fine time but given the cost and annoyance the service was I just dont see it being worth the cost. I have had better service at the all inclusives and with kids an AI just makes more sense. It does have a good location if you like going into Playa Del Carmen as we do. Its just outside of town. We also went to the Rosewood for dinner and drinks.

The Mayakoba complex has a number of huge luxury resorts including Banyan Tree, Rosewood & Mandarin Oriental. The Fairmont Mayakoba is a 45 acre estate which has complimentary BMW pedal bikes or golf buggies to get around. Travel time from Playa del Carmen bus terminal (we arrived on the ADO bus from Merida) was about 15 minutes & cost 170 pesos ($17 USD). It\u2019s about 45 minutes from the Cancun International Airport (CUN), which the concierge can arrange a shuttle bus to take you. *Room* We stayed in a Signature Casita Room, which was very large and private, clustered in blocks of 2-4 rooms around the beautiful gardens. We'd recommend requesting an upper level room, for privacy & views over the estate. The bathroom was huge & well appointed - bigger than our London apartment! With double sinks, full bath & walk in shower. As you'd expect all the fittings top quality but let down by the inconsistent maid service. Why do the maids replace only half of the towels & then just leave? It would be good if a supervisor could check each room daily to ensure all is in order. *Restaurants* Inevitably you end up eating within the complex every night, although expensive, the restaurants were excellent quality & service! Think international hotel chain menu not local cuisine. Las Brisas Terrace down by the waterfront is a great place for evening cocktails with friendly bar staff. Then take a buggy up to La Laguna for a great chicken fajita. *Facilities & Staff* Again staff varied in quality, buggy drivers were always friendly & never failed to impress - always smiling & being proactive if you looked lost in the 45 acre estate. Front desk, tour desk & restaurant staff were efficient but lacked the 'extra mile' service that you'd expect from Fairmont & the price you pay here. The beach was a little disappointing - not that wide & of limited appeal. *Summary* The sheer scale of The Fairmont Mayakoba & Mayakoba estates is impressive but it really could be any luxury resort in US, Mexico or the Caribbean - lacking the local \u2018mexican\u2019 feel.

I have stayed at the Fairmont in Seattle many times and I have enjoyed the service and surroundings, so I was looking forward to this trip. On our first night we checked in and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. Had to call for our luggage after about an hour of waiting. (Did not recieve the complimentary drink at check in though we saw others enjoying thiers). We just wanted to change, eat and get to bed after a day of travel. Made our way to La Laguna and waited and waited for service. Asked several times for water without getting it. Waiter brought the wrong dinner and when I asked him to make it right came back a few minutes later and complained that he would have to pay for the food that I had sent back. (ordered a sandwich and he brought a pizza). I couldn't get the manager to give me a straight answer as to if the server would actually get stuck with the charge so I ended up leaving an extra huge tip for crappy service. That started off the trip on a bad note. The room was large but the window dressing over the bathroom tub was broken-- think exposed velcro, staples and glue. I asked the manager about it and she confirmed, yes--it was broken, but never did anything about it- Not what i would expect at this level of a resort. If I wanted to look at home improvement projects I could have just stayed home, right? Bed was comfy but definately could hear the neighbors crying baby- so not well insultaed rooms. Housekeeping seemed random- requested earlier service (mainly so we could get the 2 bottles of water in the morning) but that didn't happen. They tell you NOT to drink the tap water and then charge 9 DOLLARS(!!!!!!) at the pool for WATER! GOODNESS! Do NOT use the ATM-- it is a $25 charge!!! Staff was perplexed at how to comp the 11% resort tax -- the conference had arranged to have that fee waived-- so several trips to the business center and front desk had to be made to confirm that they were not chanrging that fee. I agree with the others who say that the resort is too big- and the beach is tiny-- would not go to this resort if you like to beach.

While the resort was very large, it was easy to get around and felt \"small\" at times. I found walking from our casita (sp?), which was located near the hotel, to the main pool area to be enjoyable. Walking to the beach was a bit of a trek, although it was easily accessed by way of the regularly running golf carts and also by bicycle. The grounds are nothing short of spectacular, albeit completely artificial. You almost feel like you are in a rain forest - neat, but not true. It was convenient and pleasurable for everyone in our party. My wife and I are generally people on the go and I, particularly, feel constrained (stuck in fake Mexico/name your country ) at large hotels, but I never felt that way on the Fairmont. It was also easy for my in-laws and not prohibitively difficult to bring the little guy around. Overall, this was a very family friendly hotel. Amazingly, it would also be a wonderful place for a romantic getaway. The accomodations were well-appointed and very comfortable. The bathrooms were particularly well done. There was plenty of drawer and cabinet space and the rooms were very large. I found the bed extremely comfortable. I appreciated the full-sized crib they brought for my son. It was nice to sit on the deck and with a little maneuvering of chairs it was great to be out there with my whole family, a party of five. It was really nice room. The room did smell musty. When we mentioned the smell, the hotel simply said that this was from the humidity. They offered to put a dehumidifier in the room, but we all know you cannot simply dehumidify the smell of mildew away. Also, the door to our deck was broken when we first got to the room, but the staff quickly fixed this. My only other qualm with the room was the lack of minibar. I understand the eco-friendliness of this, but I like the instant access of a minibar and wish they included one. I found the service on the resort to be a mixed bag. Turn down service was irregular. One evening we asked housekeeping to come back around 7pm and they returned at 10:30, knocking on our door while our child was asleep. The \"Royal Service\" was also a bit of a misnomer. I had to request a sewing kit three times before finally receiving one. Also, I had to call three times and it took 45 minutes to get help with our bags on our departure. When I requested a play pen, I was told that it was being brought to our room, only to be told the next day (after multiple calls) that it was unavailable. The service was the weak leak at this hotel and if you need something ask early and often. The front desk was incredibly helpful and quick. I chalk much of the difficulty with service to the size of the hotel, but it was still pretty poor. The staff was always very friendly and polite. I was impressed with the restaurants overall. Las Brisas was particularly delicious at both lunch and, especially, dinner. La Laguna had a pretty solid breakfast buffet. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was more than adequate. The steak and fish place in the main building was also good, but not exceptional. The dinner at La Laguna was OK. I was pleasantly surprised to find the prices very reasonable at all the restaurants. I wish we would have explored the other restaurants at Banyan Tree and Rosewood (on the Mayakoba premises), but in all honesty, we didn't have time and it's not convenient. The services at Las Brisas and the steak and fish restaurant was excellent. The service at La Laguna was good, although we stood waiting with an infant while there were plenty of tables available one night. There were three families with young children and we all should have and could have been seated, even if we had to wait a while to be waited upon. The front of the house was not well organized or considerate of the circumstances. Otherwise, the service was very good. My wife and mother-in-law raved about the spa.

This is a wonderful resort and our stay couldn't have been better. We were treated like royalty. The best part of this resort, that many people may not realize is that most Mexican resorts' pools are not heated. (We learned the hard way five years ago at the Iberostar). In January/February, most pools in this area are ice cold and not pleasant. Not true at the Fairmont. Their pools are heated and I am so glad we stayed here because of it. We evenly divided our time between the ocean and the pool area. Both were pleasant and very comfortable. There were many shallow pool areas for my 4 year old who cannot swim yet; and while there were few lifeguards (if any), I felt that my kids were safe throughout the resort. As far as the lay out of the resort and the prior complaints about it being too big, I didn't find this to be true at all. We loved walking on the paths, riding the bicyles, or taking the golf carts. It was no problem at all. For the kids, they did have kids' bikes to check out each day. The food was outstanding. Yes, there was sticker shock and be prepared for the the high prices. For a family of 5 with glass(es) of wine, it was between $100-200 per night. It is just like eating at an expensive restaurant every night-but you got what you paid for--value and quality. (We stayed in a two room suite, and I added it up, it was no more than staying at an all inclusive with two rooms). We chose this resort because we are a family of five and the suite was perfect in having two separate rooms so the kids could sleep in, while the early risers play in the other room. The photos of the roooms and the resort do not do it justice. Everything is breathtakingly beautiful!! My only critique if any, was that while my kids, ages 4, 8, and 10 were happy and content, it would have been nice to to see more kids' activities. Perhaps there are more during the busier times and this was a quiet week there. Only on the last day did we learn that the neighboring Rosewood was doing a kayak/boat ride to the reef for snorkeling. We never knew of any such activities. I do recommend a visit to X-caret Park. We did go the the neighboring Rosewood resort one night for dinner (Punta Bonita). The food quality was incredible, but we were told that our tequilla shots were \"$5\" by the waiter. Come to find out we spent $70 on 3 shots of tequilla and $35 on three bottles of water. Be careful on that one. Overall, I highly recommend this resort--it was a dream.

My wife and I stayed 7 nights in a Deluxe Casita and were honestly depressed about leaving. We've stayed in high-end properties before (including other Fairmonts), but this place is in another category altogether. It's our first morning back home and trying replicate the restful state of mind I was in only 24 hours ago is proving to be a waste of time; even their coffee is way better than mine! I'm so impressed with this property that I'm tempted to write pages -- it would be easy -- but my life must go on and so many others have written wonderful reviews that detail all the major attractions right down to the little touches. So here are a few pro tips that others might have missed.... * The property boat tour can be a private one for you and your spouse. There are a couple time slots per day that are reserved for 2 which gives you a little privacy and the full attention of the very knowledgeable boat captain. This tour is free. Keep an eye out for the crocodiles! * The resort is family friendly, but couples shouldn't find this annoying either. Casitas are semi-private (only 4 rooms per house), the pool areas are huge with many little private nooks, and the infinite pool overlooking the lagoon is adult-only. Maybe it was my blissful state of mind, but it seemed like the kids that were there were very well behaved anyhow. I wouldn't hesitate to come back with kids or for another romantic getaway for two. * The property is huge, but we loved riding our bikes around and never had a problem finding two. When we did decide to walk we couldn't go anywhere without being offered a ride by the very courteous staff. * As a courtesy, the Fairmont will shuttle you to the other hotels on the property (Banyan Tree, Rosewood) in one of the hotel Escalades. My wife and I enjoyed the Thai restaurant, Saffron, at Banyan Tree and were even able to charge it to our room at Fairmont. * I gave the hotel a 3/5 for location, but this has to do with the Riviera Maya area in general, not this hotel specifically. This stretch of coast line is non-stop hotels that are all accessed by long roads coming in from the main highway, 307. This is not like Cancun where you might walk off the hotel property to shop or eat. In and of itself I consider this a good thing (we weren't looking for a wild spring-break style nightlife), but the only viable option for getting out and eating off-property is to take a taxi into Playa del Carmen and that will cost you $30-35 USD round trip. More often than not we chose to stay on property to eat as $30 can get you a very tasty entree. If/when you do go into Playa del Carmen, get some recommendations from the concierge as there are many terrible places to eat in Playa and you will probably pick one without some guidance :P * The beach at the Mayakoba is terrific and uncrowded. Clear blue-green waters are warm and the white sand beach is kept impeccably clean. The staff will come around and offer you complimentary homemade popsicles or fresh fruit to help keep you cool. There are a dozen or more large thatched-roof permanent umbrellas and never had an issue finding two open chairs under one.

This was our second trip to Playa. Last year we were newlyweds and stayed in town at La Tortuga (which we would really recommend). This year we came for a work conference with a 6 month old baby and two great babysitters (family). We wondered what the resort would be like after passing it last year. The setting of the hotel is beautiful. They have kept the surrounding grounds as untouched as possible. A great deal of the natural vegetation has been left alone. The hotel lobby is very open and inviting and the staff are excellent. We stayed in the hotel instead of the more private casitas. The rooms are very well apportioned and clean with very nice but simple (not ornate) furnishings and beautiful views off the balcony. I would not change the rooms or the settings. However the food is another thing. There are three restaurants. We ate at two of them. Missed the one on the first floor of the lobby. The food is very expensive and is on the very fancy side at the resaurant on the beach (las brisas). It was nice for one dinner but would not eat there more than once during the stay. The other resaurant was next to the lagoon/pools and was more simple and the food was adequate but again overpriced. And you really don't get a feel of the great food that is available less than 10 minutes away. After the second night, we rented a car and went to town in the evenings for dinner which we really enjoyed. The beach is about a 15 min walk but there are always golf carts that will take you back and forth to the hotel. This was never and issue for us even with a baby. The service at the beach was great and there are plenty of staff to help and serve.

We got a good deal on the hotel which definitely made the trip worth it. The hotel was nice, located inside the Myakoba complex which includes the Rosewood and the Banyan Tree. All three hotels can be walked through via the beach or the hotels all offer free car service betweem them. The beach was great, weather was beautiful. They offer some free ameneties such as sliced cucumbers for your eyes, popsicles, and mini fruit cups. Beach chairs and umbrellas were free and always available. The hotel had maybe 5 pool areas. The one by the beach was an infnity pool and pretty warm. The main pool was nice and included a water slide. Temperature was perfect, sometimes even a little too warm. There was also an adult pool which I dont believe was heated but was also an infinity pool looking over one of the canals. There was always ample room available at all the pools. Their \"jacuzzi\" was not much warmer thant the pools. Once the weather cooled down at about 4 PM, it would have been nice to relax in a warm jacuzzi for a bit. The restaurants in the hotel was ok but nothing too fancy. We ate at La Laguna a few times. For dinner, make sure you try to special fish for 2 people - it was fantastic!! Food overall was a ripoff. HIGHLY recommend eating all meals at the Rosewood. Prices werent that much more but the food was fantastic and service was impeccible. Worth going to. I was not impressed with the food at Banyan Tree. Food in town was a lot cheaper but very touristy - kind of a ripoff for what you get. Some to try include Cevvocola (italian), Sur (steakhouse), Yaxche (mexican). The boat ride the hotel offers was beautiful - higlight of the hotel!! You need to reserve it but it goes every hour and takes about 45 min. You see all kinds of birds and animals including even alligators. We LOVED it. A lot of the reviews complained about the size of the hotel complex. We didnt find it a problem at all. There are golf carts all over and we never needed to wait more than a few minutes. Its a 10, 15 min walk from the lobby to the beach. We stayed in a Signature Casita (were upgraded without even asking from a Deluxe Casita). The room had a terrible strong chemical odor which we complained abou but nothing was done. I guess we got used to it. It overlooked the canal. Beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was huge. Housekeeping service was great - very attentive. Lots and lots of free bottled water and the room included a coffee and tea maker as well. One thing to note is that if the hotel calls a taxi for you to go to Playa del Carmen town, they charge $17 for up to 4 people (price doubles if its 5 or more). However, on the way back, if you get a taxi from town yourself, you can negotiate with them all the way down to $10 dollars. Recommend getting their # and calling them yourself whenever you want to go to town. You should sign up for the Presidents Club - you get free wireless internet (only in the lobby). The room includes a wire for you. Also get free access to the health club (spa is $25 extra). Hotel is VERY quiet - theres not much, if at anything going on. No activities like water arobics or beach volleyball or anything at all. We stayed a week and were getting bored towards the end. Good if you want to get away from it all and just relax. The hotel is a good value for what you get. Its listed as a 5 star but is more like a 4-5 star - dont have too high expectations. You get what you pay for!

I stay at Fairmonts pretty often so I had a suite upgrade voucher which we used to upgrade to a Signature Casita Suite. That plus a Friends&Family promotional rate made the trip a great deal. But the spa & food was very expensive, so we still managed to spend quite a bit. Room : The suite was gorgeous and right on one of the canals, with no suites on the other side. We really loved sitting on our balcony in the morning & evening and looking at all the birds and fish in the canal. Clearly it's all man-made, but it felt like we were in a rainforest jungle. Ok, maybe a rainforest jungle disney ride - but we loved it. The bathroom(s) were fabulous & huge. Fairmont beds are always outstanding and these were no exception. I will say I don't think I would have enjoyed the trip nearly as much if we had been in one of the regular Fairmont rooms or one of the Casita rooms overlooking the less lush part of the canals. Property - the resort is huge and sprawling, but we didn't mind this at all since the golf carts can take you to the beach or spa or wherever you want to go which wasn't a big deal to us. I didn't feel like cattle, as another reviewer said. Also we don't mind walking. If I hadn't been 6 months pregnant at the time, I would have ridden the free bikes everywhere. I spent most of the time at the beach, the water was beautiful. The resort would be GREAT for kids I think since they'd get a kick out of the golf carts & bikes and the pools are really nice. I do think they could improve on the beach chairs -- it would be nice to have the teak cushion ones that are at the adult pool, rather than the cheap-ish ones they have. Restaurants - We ate the Laguna restaurant for breakfast every day and a couple times for lunch. It was pretty good, nice view of the canal, good for bird/turtle/fish/kittycat watching. Las Brisas has a great view of the ocean for lunch, and we ate dinner one night there. The food was good but the service was slow. Service - Super friendly, always greeted with a smile and a hello everywhere we went. No complaints in this department whatsoever. Spa - Amazing facility. I loved and took full advantage of the private pool on the roof, and the little cakes and fruit provided. Very relaxing. My massage (neck, shoulder & foot) was fabulous (but not inexpensive). Overall -- We had a great time and would go back if we could get the same rate. Would be a great place for kids I think too. Playa del Carmen is a good change of pace for dinner, about a 15 minute drive south (we had a rental car). Next time we would probably stay closer to Tulum though, because it seems more old school authentic Mexico down there, which is more our style generally. But we loved it!

They enjoyed bike riding inside the property on pleasant trails & swimming in the lovely, irregularly shaped, main pool. The rooms are exceptionally well planned for comfort. Our room had two closets, a large & lovely bathroom with separate toilet & a walk in rain shower with an atrium next to the tub. We booked two rooms for our family of four & both were on a canal that was quiet & peaceful - however the morning sun did wake us up over the water - it was tropical bright!

We ate leisurely dinners at one of several on site venues & watched pay per view ($16) before getting a restful & comfortable sleep. I have only a couple less than favorable things to say about this otherwise very relaxing property: firstly, a resort of this caliber should have the retail for a guest to replace lost luggage or go a little crazy. There was absolutely nothing available to read besides magazines other than a very small collection of books in English (Twighlight & New Moon anyone?) & only Foster Grant sunglasses & a few swim items for wardrobe needs. I believe a spontaneous guest should be able to find something more unique at a property of this calibre. Second & lastly, service by the front desk could be snippy at times & unhelpful often. I was sent all over the property trying to purchase a wi fi connection for my e reader - to no avail.

And then once we arrived in our room, maintenance was there fixing a problem with the lighting for the next half hour. We didn't mind too much at the time, but we never received an apology from the front desk. Our room is a big disappointment as well. We're staying in the Beach area Casita room, which is roughly $800 a night (with taxes during peak holiday) and our view is the tropical equivalent of a brick wall. Nothing pretty to look at. We have not spent one second on the deck looking at our view. I think there are very few rooms at the hotel that actually have a view of the beach. The best part of the room is the gorgeous bathroom. As many others have mentioned, the grounds are too massive for the hotel to handle. You have to call for a golf cart to go anywhere and you feel like you're cattle being shuttled from one area to another. This hotel is not suited for couples at all.

All three are similar in that they feature rooms and suites in private villas scattered throughout an expansive property of canals and mangrove jungle. There is a lot to like about these new lovely resorts but there is one significant flaw: most rooms are far (15-20 minute walk) from the beach. All the resorts have golf cart shuttles and bicycles to help overcome this. They have some boats too but they didn't seem to be reliable except for a tour of the canals. The Fairmont also lacks enough bicycles to make that work (although we noticed that Banyon tree assigned a bike to anyone who wanted one). So you better get used to golf cart shuttling. We were there during the low season which may have exacerbated the transportation issue and also contributed to another complaint: the service wasn't great with some of the pool bars closed or pool service not being offered in some areas. The pool near the beach had the best service and gorgeous views so that is where i recommend that you go in low season. The Spa pool was also partially dysfunctional and the lack of urgency to get it fixed may have indicated that business is a bit slow. Overall, I think Mayakoba is spectacular. The best option looks like Banyon Tree or Rosewood, but Fairmont is beautiful too and we got a fantastic deal on a Fairmont suite that made it worthwhile. They didn't seem to mind if we, as a Fairmont guest, used the Rosewood or Banyon tree pools. There are some beach area rooms and suites which mostly eliminate the transportation concern, although these may be less private than the villas scattered among the canals. A couple money saving secrets: join Fairmont presidents club to get free internet and other perks. And if you rent from Hertz, valet parking is free.

The gym was nice, with state-of-the-art equipment and a spa facility which was awesome as well. But the resort fell short in many areas. The tennis courts are sand over carpet with broken nets, no water or towels, and no phone to call for a ride. We were forgotten and had to walk 15 minutes back. The pool main pool area was nice, but the lounge chairs were cheap and un-comfortable. Not once were we greeted to have chairs moved or towells delivered. We had to chase down the waiters on numerous occasions, so service there lacked big time. The beach itself is sparse and the hotel made little effort to keep trach off of it. The ocean water in front of the hotel was dirty and trash on the beach and not the Cancun-blue we expected. Simply put, I could have been anywhere in the world sitting by a pool without the feel of being in the Mayan area of Mexico. The food in the main restaurant La Laguna was just average as well. If you face the golf course, know that they have lawn blowers and mowers outside your room at 7am as well. The design of the resort is also funky, as the beach is a 15 minute walk from non-beachfront rooms (or you had to wait for a golf cart or ride a bike) and once you get to the other pool by the ocean, it was tight and small. This resort is one of 3 in the Mayakoba Complex (shares with Rosewood and Banyan Tree). We previewed the Rosewood, and while it looked more appealing, it too was a ways from the acutal beach. To top it off, someone in the hotel staff changed the name under our reservation, so I was being called by another guest's name each time I did anything. I had to spend 15 minutes going through my bill line by line to be certain all of the charges were mine, and all I got in return was \"I am sorry\". Poor service at the end for sure. All in all, I would not return. If you go here despite this review, be sure to join the Fairmont Club beforehand, as then you get free internet and $10 off the spa facility rate, which was a joke. They charge a \"resort fee\" of $15 per day, only then to turn around and charge you $15 to $25 per person to use the spa facility (hot tub and steam rooms), but they were free if you bought massages. We then left and went to Cancun and stayed on a white beach at The Westin Lagunamar and LOVED it! If you want a kitchen-type suite, a spralling pool and beach, or nice tennis courts, go there, or a higher end is Live Aqua, very nice and high end and also a GREAT location. Would not do The Ritz or Le Meridian, as there is little to do in that part of Cancun, their pools are small, and there is little to do there.

It was truly paradise! I had never been to Mexico before and I was concerned that the resort might be too hard partying for my taste. The Riviera Maya complex - which houses the Fairmont, the Rosewood and the Banyan Tree (if I have that right) - is the complete opposite of spring break. The resorts are situated on acres and acres of rivers and tropical foliage. It's stunningly beautiful, quiet and truly in tune with nature. I highly recommend taking a tour of the Fairmont by boat. The hotel was about forty minutes from the Cancun airport - farther than I would have liked, but a small price to pay for the experience we had. Check-in was seamless with a welcome drink and cold towel. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a Signature Casita (I should note it was a very quiet week at the resort). The hotel room was half bedroom, half bathroom, with a grand marble soaking tub and standing shower. It was perfect for a honeymoon. In keeping with Fairmont standards, the bed was really comfortable. The bedroom area opened up onto a patio overlooking a river. As long as you had bug spray, it was the perfect spot for an evening drink. The Fairmont is large - 46 acres, I believe - so you need to get around by golf cart, bike or boat. My husband and I frequently used the bike option and it was really fun! The resort has so many ammenities. There are three pools - the \"main pool\", which was huge and impressive, the \"quiet pool\", and a pool on the beach (my personal favorite). The beach is about a ten minute walk from where our guestrooms were located. Other reviewers complained about this, but it wasn't a problem for me. The beach was beautiful and never crowded. There are also quite a few restuarants. La Laguna had an awesome breakfast buffet each morning with fresh fruit, yogurt and traditional hot Mexican dishes. I ate there every day for almost a week and never got tired of it. Las Brisas overlooks the beach and is great for a romantic dinner. The service at both restaurants was wonderful. The Fairmont will also shuttle you between the two other resorts on the complex. I recommend Safron at the Banyon Tree for some great Thai food. The service at the Fairmont Mayakoba was amazing. My husband and I were always addressed by name and greeted by the staff whenever we encountered them. Housekeeping, which I usually don't comment on unless it is poor, was outstanding. Our room was cleaned daily with an additional turn-down service in the evening. This is great for a couple taking daily naps :) I would not hesitate to return to the Fairmont Mayakoba... we plan on coming back for our first anniversary!", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Experience in an awe inspiring environment\u201d", "Author": "iamheatseeker", "ReviewID": "UR79286074", "Content": "After an extremely lengthy process I chose the Fairmont for a romantic getaway.

If you are looking for a rowdy time or a place to meet new people..look elsewhere. This hotel grounds were pristine and the service was the most consistent and thoughtful I have yet to receive. The beach and pool is a short golf cart ride away and the sand was perfect, the service was not too intrusive but attentive. There are 8 amazing pools and if you are looking to mix it up a bit don't overlook the other pools beside the beachside pool. The food is incredible at Mayakoba and considering this is a five star resort the prices were extremely reasonable to me for the quality of ingredients and service level. The breakfast buffet is a great deal and while overlooking the lagoons a perfect serene way to start the morning. The best part about this area is that you feel like you have been transported to a private jungle retreat and yet in less than five minutes you are escorted to this pristine beach. The balance of nature and luxury is an amazing achievement. I definitely recommend going to Banyan Tree for dinner or drinks that place is simply stunning and breathtaking. As I said the service is the best I have had...even beyond the Four Seasons Maui which was uncontested to this point. But... it is not for everyone. It is for people who want to feel unplugged and relax.

Make sure to try the short ribs. Sushi is also served in the lobby lounge every evening, and I found it quite delicious. Other highlights of this resort include the lagoon (make sure you take a boat ride in the lanchas), all of the various flora and fauna, and the spa. We had the best massage and the spa facilities are terrific. You can basically spend a whole half day hanging out in the spa. I do agree with other reviewers that the resort is a bit spread out, but I honestly liked walking around, so it wasn't a problem.

My daughter was married in a beautiful ocean front ceremony at the Fairmont Mayakoba, and we would not have changed a thing for our guests or ourselves. We had over eighty guests traveling from NYC, LA, Chicago, Memphis and more. These were discerning travelers and diners, and they were all happy that my daughter and her husband chose the Fairmont Mayakoba as their wedding location. Our guests were enchanted by the unique, eco-friendly environment and were very pleased with the resort's restaurants and their menus. Few left the resort to dine elsewhere. I would describe the rooms are \"more than spacious,\" and we all had a wonderful time enjoying the resort's amenities and services. You may read criticism about the expanse of the Fairmont's landscape, but we did not hear one complaint about getting from one point to another. The golf carts were frequent, and our guests enjoyed the boats and BMW bicycles. Traveling through the lush, tropical grounds is part of the experience, and the buildings were designed to blend in with the landscape. There is no towering complex here, and the view from the main building is stunning, sweeping across mangrove forests and lagoons to the ocean. The Fairmont website is a fair depiction of the layout, so if it looks good to you, you'll love it. The food was fabulous, and the seafood was amazingly fresh. The chefs at El Puerto, in the main building, were not tied to their menu and were willing to create dishes at our request. I had tasted fried capers on our site visit, and these in a lemon butter sauce over Red Snapper (not fishy here!) was unbelievable. La Laguna, in the center of the resort by the main pool, offers a great family style menu that includes local traditions that are great for passing around the table or a small meal. Try the Salade Nicoise or Steak Salad ocean front at Las Brisas. I enjoyed them several times on both our site visit and the week of the wedding. The prawns in all three restaurants are huge and to die for! The rooms are wonderful: large, open and airy. The bathrooms in the Casitas are about the size of normal hotel room, and my daughter and her husband were given a two story suite with a private pool on the top. These were recommended over the ocean front suites for their privacy, and the view over the lagoon and marsh was breathtaking. Most - if not all - rooms had a balcony or deck, and the service in the rooms was impeccable. For those of you considering the Fairmont Mayakoba as a destination wedding site, do it! The management and staff were a delight to work with, and they made things so easy for us. There was no need for a separate wedding planner as the resort's services took care of most of what we wanted, including the cake. The events department connected us with florists (including their own in-house florist), photographers, ceremony officiants, and entertainiment providers. We were able to put together a wedding that suited our tastes and budget, and the plan was unique to what my daughter and her husband wanted for their wedding. With today's internet communication and Google, you can plan a destination wedding easily from home, and you will know that you are getting what you want.

They said probably not but I could check the store that is halfway to the beach to find out. I didn't trust them so I went to the store down in the main building which was closer and tadaaaa toothbrushes, nice ones for $3.50. Aside from that the service at the restaurants are horrible.

We had two adjoining rooms in the cabanas with a jungle view. It was very quiet and peaceful. The weather was very pleasant but a little chilly at night. Yuki, the Concierge was very helpful with our dinner reservations. However, the only available restaurant for breakfast was La Laguna and it was often chaotic with lots of empty tables and people waiting. There was a buffet but with optional menu service. One night after an all day tour of Chichen Itza and Tulum, we had not made a reservation. We attempted to go to La Laguna and there was lots of empty tables and a one hour wait! La Puerto was our favorite on the first night. Las Brisas overlooking the beach was a beautiful setting but the menu was a little limited and different especially for the boys. We ate most of our lunches and snacks around the pools or the beach. The guacamole and chips are to die for. We ate it at least twice a day. Pool and beach food and drink service was great. Our private tour to Chichen Itza was a delight with Carlos Diaz as our tour guide. He picked us up in a nice air-conditioned van and delighted us with his stories the entire day. He had suggested an itinerary that suited us just fine as well as setting up a private tour guide at Chichen Itza. Rafael met us at the gate and he was a wealth of information for adults as well as our two boys, age 10 and 16. After the tour, Carlos took us to a nearby Maya village for an authentic Mayan lunch which was divine. The sidewalk style cafehad the grill right at the front and it produced the best grilled chicken my family has ever had. Even my picky 10 year old could not get enough of the chicken which also came with homemade corn tortillas, white rice, quesadillas, guacamole and tacos.

It was interesting watching a spinning class the entire time we were wolfing down great pasta. The name of the restaurant was Pomarola. It is a 10 minute taxi ride into town. The last night we had dinner at the Rosewood Hotel next door. We ate at the casual Mexican grill overlooking the beach. It was taco night and we tried a variety of different types of tacos, all that were excellent. It is a beautiful hotel but not as family friendly.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC, USA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Room and Property but Pricey and Limited Activities and Food Choices\u201d", "Author": "TheRoadJessTraveled", "ReviewID": "UR62703463", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Fairmont for 5 nights while attending a wedding, also at the Fairmont. The hotel and grounds are lovely, and the room was really nice, particularly because all of the rooms seem to have a nice balcony and beautiful bathroom, and great lotions and little extras. However, don't stay here if you're concerned about money! Maintly because of the food costs, and also the limited food choices which basically forces you to eat the high priced food at the hotel. I think there were only 3 restaurants on the property, and all were pretty expensive. Also, the staff, while very nice, seemed at times to be clueless about what was going on at their hotel. For example, we were told incorrect information multiple times about the hours that the restaurants were open, which restaurants were open and closed due to special events, and when hotel events took place. Instead of saying that they didn't know, they told us incorrect information, which was more problematic than helful. Another thing which increases the cost of staying there is that you basically have to take a taxi if you want to go anywhere outside of the hotel. The cost for taxi each way from the Fairmont to Playa del Carmen city was 165 pesos each way (approx $15 depending on the exchange rate). One night we needed a taxi for 6 people and the cost doubled, to 350 pesos each way. Some of my favorite things about the hotel were the infiniti pool, the beautiful beach, the bikes which the hotel lets you pick up anywhere, and the boat ride. The boat ride is very infrequently offered (maybe 2x/day) but it's free so try and do it as an alternate way to get to the beach. There are 2 beautiful pools, one infiniti pool by the beach and another closer to the rooms. While the one close to the rooms looked great, I couldn't stay there because it was too hot! The rooms and the pools away from the beach feel like they're in a sauna, while by the beach there is a lovely breeze at all hours which makes the heat tolerable. You also might be surprised at how far the beach is from your room. You could walk or bike to the beach, but most times you take the golf carts, which are pretty convenient and come pretty quickly. If anyone from the hotel reads this, I have a couple of suggestions that would go a long way.... 1st - why would they charge a per person/per day fee? I can understand if it's charged if more than 2 people stay in a room, but why charge it if 1 or 2 people stay in the room? Just add it to the hotel fee, no? It's silly to add another $30 for a couple each night they stay at the hotel. Otherwise, consider adding a couple little changes like the ones below to warrent such a fee.... 2nd - I would highly recommend putting water coolers around the pool areas (at the very least) for guests to use. While the rooms do have 2 small water bottles each day, why not allow guests to refill their bottles around the hotel when they're out? Is it just to sell water at the restaurants? It's so hot in Mexico that I was surprised that water wasn't more readily available. The practice of relying on the water bottles seemed wasteful to me, environmentally and a waste of money to continue to have to buy water bottles at $6 for a large water bottle from the restaurant! 3rd - consider putting a big communal sunscreen at the pools for guests to use. I've seen this done at other hotels, and given that the Mayakoba is upscale and in hot Mexico, I think it would go a long way. Especially because the only place to buy sunscreen is near the lobby, which is quite a ways from both of the pools, this small touch would've gone a long way! 4th - make the health club free! Again, this is an expensive hotel, and if you're charging a extra per person/night fee, I was really surprised that there is a $10/day charge for the gym. I had a nice stay, but next time would limit my stay at the Mayakoba to a couple of days for relaxation only, and then stay in Playa del Carmen city for the rest of the time to have some fun and more and less expensive choices for food, drinks, etc. Feel free to email if you have any questions!", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lali2010", "ReviewID": "UR62499761", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in February 2010.

Right away - I must say that I thought their service was amazing and am surprised by any complaints in other reviews. On the last day when I checked out, unbeknownst to me, I had left my wallet in the room. I was with a large group all leaving at the same time.... The bellman found me in the midst of that craziness an hour after I had let the room, told me he had found me wallet and that security had it. Security came to return it to me and NOTHING had been taken -- all my credit cards and cash was still there. I was so impressed by their honesty and service!!! Other points about their service, one day when we came to get something in the room before lunch, we saw the room had not been made up yet. We called housekeeping and asked that they clean the room by 2pm so we could nap our kids then and they proactively asked if we'd like our room cleaned at 12:30 (lunch time) everyday.... and proceeded to do so for the remaining 8 days. That first day they left a voicemail to make sure that the room had been done in time. Again, very impressed with the follow-up. Every staff member you pass when you walk around the hotel greets you with a smile and says good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Also, anyone driving a cart stops to let you pass by. I was with a group that had its own special food service, so I can't speak to the restaurant service, but again, everyone else was very nice. Our food was served in the conference center ballrooms for each meal and our 2 waiters were very attentive. In terms of the facilities: While the beach is a golf-cart ride away, it was never a long wait to get on a cart and ride there, and once you did you could enjoy the beautiful beach or the pool. The main pool (not near the beach) was large and never felt over crowded. Around the edge of the pools was shallow platforms in the water, perfect for my infant and toddler to splash around in. And everyone had fun with the water slide. Again, I was with a special group that had its own food set up by the pool and beach, so I can't speak to any wait time for poolside food/beverage service, but the people who helped set up the lounges and provide towels were extremely friendly and helpful. In terms of the restaurants, on our last night there, my husband and I had drinks and tapas in the lobby lounge and they were delicious. We had a ground-floor room in one of the casitas. The room was spacious and the bathroom was extremely large. On the downside, for the TV, the children's channels were all in spanish, even though many other channels were in English. Also, we had a patio but it didn't really have any view and was not that appealing -- there was just the hedge/plants that bordered it. It was kind of depressing and felt very closed in. Otherwise, the beds were comfy, there closets specious, etc. For you parents - we used the babysitting service our last 3 nights. Each night we had the same sitter, Katya, and she was lovely. She even brought crayons with her to entertain my 4 yr old and when she found out he loved the movies Cars, Wall-e and Toy Story, the next 2 nights she brought print outs of the characters for them to color together.

After reading the reviews I was well prepared. I travelled with my mom and two boys (11 and 13) We all loved the bikes, pools and beach. We rented a car from Hertz (3 days), but could not get one later in the week due to the busy Spring Break season. It's great to have a car, as there is not much to do and the tours are not my thing. We love to snorkel and travelled to Xel Ha, and Akumal. I highly recommend both. Ask the concierge about going to Akumal in a car. Best snorkelling and day trips are south of Playa and getting through Playa will take 30 minutes if you don't know the short cuts. We did the Hidden Worlds trip as well. It is very rustic, but lots of fun. My boys loved it, but the Jungle ride was rough on my mom. We ate at Fusion on the beach in Playa and the food and atmosphere were perfect. The beach is amazing, and you can walk for miles in both directions. Take your snorkel gear up to Hacienda tres rios (about 1 mile north) Grab an umbrella at the beach early in the day . It's the best place to have lunch, though you may have to flag someone down to wait on you. The bikes are really great and the best way to get around the resort. People do try to stash them at their doors. Don't be shy about taking one if you need it. It's big and it's not close to the beach, but if you like to be active and outdoors it's excellent. If you don't like to be active and outdoors, maybe you should go to Florida. The canal tour is a must! Book it when you get there. The yummy muffins in the store by the pool are the best deal in the place if you're trying to watch your money. The wine is very pricey, so buy a couple bottles in Playa and put them in the little fridge in your room. Cork screws and wine glasses are in the rooms. And cokes are $4 each so you may want to have extra in the room. Don't bother buying the water in the restaurant. We drank the tap water and no one got sick. Plus, bottled water is bad for the environment. The food was okay, but nothing to rave about. The rooms are great, very large, huge bathrooms and comfortable beds. We had a deluxe and signature casita. The only difference was the view. My room had a connecting door and we could hear the neighbors pretty clearly. But the room without the connecting door didn't seem to have that problem. The birds are pretty noisy in the morning, but I liked to get up and take early walks on the beach.

We booked a beach area casita room which was in the group of rooms and suites that are closest to the beach (the other rooms are a good 15 minute walk or 5 minute golf cart drive away). We were put in room 831 which I recommend you request you NOT get. Upon checking into the room, I noticed a constant running water sound. At first we thought it was the toilet and even had maintenance out to look at it only to discover it was coming from the hot tub in the suite above us. Every time the hot tub heater kicked on, it would send water down the pipes that ran alongside one of our walls. Aside from the water sound, we could also hear people walking around and moving furniture upstairs. The view from our patio consisted of the golf course buffer. We noticed that all the other beach area casitas (the rooms, not the suites) had views overlooking the lagoon. I am a light sleeper so after putting up with this for a night, we asked to be moved to one of the ocean front casitas. Ocean front casita was much, much better (it is it's own self contained unit with no one upstairs or sharing a wall). We had a hammock and direct walk out to the beach, but had to sacrifice a king size bed for 2 queen sized beds and paid an extra $200 per night. We were hoping that the hotel would compensate us for having to upgrade, but they didn't offer even though they knew we were upset with our original assignment. As for the service, the front desk people were not very friendly especially given our room situation. When we would call the concierge or the \"royal service\" as they call it, we often got the run around or were told that someone would call us back which never happened. Their follow through was definitely lacking. Upon check-out, no one even asked how we enjoyed our stay. Not a major issue, but it does sum up the general attitude of the place. Overall, here is a summary of the good and the bad: Good: * Great for families. We saw a lot of families with young kids and the resort seems to really cater to them. * Beautiful, well--maintained grounds. *Rooms were very clean * Spa was nice and services we had were top-notch *food is okay and not too terribly overpriced Bad: *Front desk and concierge service is severely lacking and not very good at addressing complaints or issues in a timely manner. *Not very nice for a romantic getaway weekend. Felt the resort was more geared towards families (we checked out the Banyan Tree and Rosewood which both seemed much better alternatives for romantic getaways) *Rooms are hit or miss. Especially in the beach area, the regular rooms (not the suites) are dark and showing their age. *beach chairs are uncomfortable and warped. Would also be nice to have kayaks available for people to use like the other resorts offered. Recommendations if you do stay there: *The Bose radios in each room have an auxillary jack to play your ipod so bring an auxillary cord if you want to listen to your ipod in the room. We asked if they had some cords at the hotel, but they did not. *Rent a car so you can go into Playa del Carmen. Great nightlife and lots of cheap food options. We also went to Cozumel one day via the ferry. *Buy drinks and snacks at a 7-11 or an OXXO on the way to the hotel and keep them in the room's mini-fridge.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cabo San Lucas", "Title": "\u201cIn the Jungle!\u201d", "Author": "kpmconsulting", "ReviewID": "UR58321559", "Content": "We arrived late in the evening and the drive in was beautiful.

And, we weren't to leave him in the room unattended.

They were kind enough to bring us a pet bed and dog bowls. I thought that was really nice of them! The room was nicely decorated and had a view of thick brush- nothing else. Unfortunately, we completely unpacked before pulling back the sheets. Thick black (possibly mold?) smear on the sheets and pillow. Called down to have sheets changed and they came fairly quickly.

It seems like a better AC would take the moisture out of the air. Our toilet did not flush properly and we had to call for service 3 times. Each time they sent someone to look at it, by the third time they finally got it fixed. We were somewhat hoping they would upgrade us for the inconvenience, but we didn't ask and they didn't offer. The only heated pool was the main pool, very expansive. There was a great kiddie pool area w/ separate 1' and 2' pools, heated next to the main pool. We didn't swim in the infinity pool at the ocean bc it was too cold, but it was beautiful to look at. The food at the resort was not outrageously priced at the restaurant on the beach or the restaurant at the main pool, $20-40 entrees, but they will get you on the drinks. A liter bottle of Evian water was $8 in the restaurant. We had a better experience at La Laguna, which is the one at the pool, but that was mostly due to the excellent server, Wilbert. We drove 20 minutes to Playa del Carmen for dinner one evening and lunch one afternoon. It was a tough to find parking both times we visited PDC, but it was nice to have the freedom of a rental car. We really enjoyed dinner at El Bistro on 10th Ave. We stumbled upon a Walmart, so we bought food to have for breakfast and snacks for the little one, much cheaper than resort breakfast or room service. We also drove an hour to Tulum. A must see, get there between 8-9, before it gets hot and crowded. We did lunch at Mezzanine in Tulum and highly recommend it. The boat tour at the Fairmont was nice. It goes out 8, 9, and 10am, reservation required. I had thought you could ride the boat to the beach in addition to the golf carts and bikes, but that is not the case. The only way to ride the boat is to sign up for one of these tours. The beach was beautiful with fine white sand and calm, light blue water. It was not crowded during our stay, plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas. The worst part of our trip was not at the hotel, but the airport. Our camera was stolen out of our checked luggage. So, we have no pictures from our trip.

We had a great experience. We stayed in one of the beach casitas. The room was spacious and clean. There is a refrigerator in every room. You can go to the little store by the main pool and buy items to stock the refrigerator and they will deliver it to your room. Our room came with butler service. A butler is really your own personal concierge. We had no need to utilize this service. The regular concierge in the hotel is accessible by phone, and provided excellent service. Your \"butler\" needs to be contacted by the hotel to call you. You have to call the hotel, ask for your butler, and then they will contact your butler via their pager or two way phone. Other than showing us the property and familiarizing us with our room we never saw them. My boyfriend golfed one day and said it was a good experience. We went to Las Brisas for lunch our first day and it was excellent. We also ate lunch on the beach all the other days under a palapa. It was wonderful and the beach service was excellent. The beach attendants bring you to a palapa of your choice and lay perfectly fitted towels over chairs of your choice. They then bring by cool towels periodically. The waiters on the beach were very attentive. I highly recommend the mango margaritas, and the beer comes in little ice buckets. The beach is an excellent swimming beach with a sandy bottom. The pools are beautiful. The infinity pool by the beach is very picturesque, and looks brand new. All of the pools were so different from one another. We spent all of our time in the beach area so didn't go in the other pools. We ate at El Puerto twice for dinner. The food was incredible, and the service was perfect. Sit outside if you have the chance. I had a spa day that was very memorable, with one of the best massages I have ever had. It is a large spa with lots of amenities and a peaceful atmosphere. After receiving a spa service you are welcome in the spa all day. I got a massage, left the spa and went to the beach, and then later went back and soaked in the pools . There is a large jacuzzi on the women's side and two co-ed pools on the roof surrounded by lounge chairs. Both of these pools are heated.The spa was open until 9PM when we were there. I rode a bike from the beach area to the spa, it took about 10 minutes. The bikes are in various locations around the resort. You ride one to your destination, and leave it for someone else. If you see a bike it's yours. They were in good shape, be sure to test the brakes before you go too far. There is also golf cart service to get you where you need to go. We never waited long, and you can always call and they will pick you up at your room. The overall service at the Fairmont Mayakoba was excellent. We would go back in a heartbeat, hopefully soon! Make sure you sign up for the Fairmont President's Club. You will receive free internet, discounts at the spa and you will not have to pay the daily fee for the gym.

Restaurants- Laguna is a pretty good restaurant, but skip the boring guac/salsa. Shrimp is excellent in general, fresh and bouncy. Puerta has a great whole snapper; fresh and perfectly prepared. At Coco Maya, baked goods are delicious (especially the hazelnut cookie). Pools- there are many, the best being the infinity pool by the beach. All are in need of renovation as they're a bit tired looking. There are kids everywhere, not just at the pool with the waterslide. I would recommend the spa at the neighboring Rosewood, a much smaller and more upscale property. We were taken in the complimentary car, and spent the day there. The spa area is peaceful and beautiful, the spa has its own outdoor pool, along with indoor hot/cold plunge pools.

With kids, try to have a room close to the main pool area and La Laguna restaurant to save walking. The place is spotless, and the rooms almost hidden in the jungle setting. Very quiet the week we were there, but next week is very busy hosting the PGA tournament. The golf course looks beautiful . Be sure to join the Presidents Club (free) for free internet and daily paper. If your laptop does not have ethernet, then wifi is only available in the lobby and restaurant areas and not in the rooms. There is an ethernet cable in the rooms however. All of the staff learned my kids names and were able to accommodate any request. Be aware for younger kids, the children's menu is the same at all the restaurants. The pool became heated midway through our stay which made things better. The kids pool has a waterslide. The beachfront pool with the \"disappearing edge\" was my favourite. The beach area is FANTASTIC, with clear and shallow area for swimming and wide powder sand. Lots of beach recliners and umbrellas and staff to bring towels and drinks and snacks. The kids club is a little shaky, although it does have an organized schedule and your kids can come and go over the day and 3 hours per day per child is included with the room rate. The teenage \"camp\" is a room with a Wii and 2 pingpong tables and no real activities. There were few if any teens while we were there, so we opted out of that. We had a rental car, and valet parking was efficient but $14/day. Easy to drive to Playa del Carmen, so we had a lot of meals away from the hotel for variety (and to save a few $). Definitely recommend a day trip to Xcaret and also to Xel-Ha; the kids LOVED it. At the hotel, the golf cart transportation and the bicycles added to the charm. Definitely take the little boat tour around the canals to see the fascinating layout.

I know some people have complained about the layout of the resort but we actually really liked this aspect of the hotel- it made the resort seem spacious and not overcrowded or over-run. My husband and I enjoyed biking around the property, taking longs walks and when we were tired or not in the mood of physical activity- we never had a problem getting a ride on the shuttle that runs quite literally every 4-5 minutes.

We were seeking a quiet, private hotel with plenty of opportunities to relax. We got it. Our deluxe casita room was upgraded (without our asking) to a signature casita room free of charge. The room had a huge balcony overlooking a canal. The pillows were soft and comfy. Double closets. Double sinks. A big, wall-length window in the bathroom (covered by a wall outside to ensure privacy) gave lots of light. I never heard any neighbors through the wall/floors. Daily newspaper was USA Today. We didn't use the internet service. Maid service did a great job. During turndown service at night, they'll swap any used towels and provide fresh bottled water for the evening. We loved the french-press coffee and tea service that was refilled every day. The room also had a wine bucket/glasses/corkscrews. They have a Bose radio player that is compatible with iPhones, but NOTE: there is not a \"dock\" for iPhones on the Bose player. You need to bring an aux adapter cable (not USB) to connect your iPhone. I called the front desk for one, and while the hotel is supposed to have some available, there was never one free when I called for it. The spa was great. You've got access all day if you have a treatment, and after a couples massage my husband and I spent the whole day at the spa pool (we were the only ones up there, so it was like having a pool to ourselves for the day). The spa has complimentary water, fruit, muffins, and juice. You can use the spa, leave, and come back the same day without having to pay again. It was no problem to book an appointment for the time we wanted within 24 hours notice. The gym is in the spa building; my husband bought a 5 day pass for $40. The resort seemed almost empty at the end of January. A trickle of guests; most of the beach/pool chairs were empty and it was never a problem to get a table at the restaurants. There were many families on the property, and the kids seemed to enjoy their pool with the water slide. I saw the babysitting group doing a nature program by the turtle pond, and they looked to be having fun. The beach was nice, but we stuck to the pools most of the time. The hotel is on a long stretch of resorts, so you can walk either direction on the beach for a long time without leaving populated areas. Become members of the Fairmont hotel chain rewards program before arriving. This gives you perks like 10 percent off at the spa (if you sign up for the program on site the perks are available for your next visit, but not the current stay). I'm a picky eater, and I liked almost everything I ate. Quesadillas were great, tuna tartare with avocado was wonderful. Las Brisas has a great tasting menu with superb wine pairings. Watch the wine selections at the Mexican restaurant by the main pool: one glass of simple pinot grigio cost $18, and it was warm and sour -- I sent it back without trouble. Yes, the food is on the expensive side, but at least you're getting good quality for the money. I've been to too many resort hotels where the food is expensive yet lackluster. Pool service is pretty consistent -- they make great mojitos at $10 a drink. We went over to the Banyan Tree resort next door for dinner one night, and that property is stunning. The hotel provided a free shuttle both ways (they're both in the \"Mayakoba\" development). We enjoyed good Thai food at Saffron. Amazing service, beautiful views, excellent food. If you want some variety, check out Banyan Tree. The service is even better than the high level provided by the Fairmont. We didn't mind walking/taking the shuttle around the vast resort. The spread out nature of the resort gives it a quieter and less crowded feel, and that's what we wanted. We thought about renting a car for a day, but decided against it. Cost would have been $60 for 24 hour. We took a cab into Playa del Carmen one night ($20 one way with tip) and walked the main shopping street. Food was a lot less expensive at the local restaurants in town, but we quickly missed the serenity of the resort. I recommend going to the Cancun airport website and booking a shuttle in advance. For two people roundtrip in a private shuttle, it cost us a total of $105. This was much lower than the price quoted by the hotel for transfers. The service was friendly, and after giving your room number at a restaurant, you were always addressed by Mr. and Mrs. Last Name. I was happy with the service -- we were always greeted with an \"hola\" or \"buenos tardes.\" Then again, if you walk around with a smile on your face, you're more likely to see a smile back.

The property is very large and spread out, and while this allows for ample privacy, it also means that everything is a schlepp. Our casita was right in the middle of the property, equidistant from the main building and the beach.

The pools, the beach, the buildings and the landscaping were impeccably built and maintained and it really felt like we were completely removed from everything else. The food was good and fairly reasonably priced -- keep in mind that we didn't eat at the main lodge restaurant which offered more fine-dining cuisine. The menu was impressive however. The Mayakoba is a wonderful getaway for those who are looking to travel with family or just as a romantic getaway.

From the moment we made our reservation Marco the concierge attended to our every need. Without being pushy he requested and arranged airport transfers and other transportation. He also sent us a packet detailing all the holiday festivities the hotel had planned. When we arrived we were graciously greeted by the friendly bell staff with cold towels and refreshing juice. Both served from silver trays. This along with the breathtaking lobby was a big \"wow\" moment for all of us after our long flight. In short, we knew we had made the right decision as to where to spend our holiday. The hotel grounds and rooms are very well kept with very nice toiletries and linens in the spacious rooms. The management must be very careful in who they select to work at the hotel because EVERYONE IS POLITE, FRIENDLY, AND HELPFUL. It is nothing short of amazing how management has pulled this great feat off. EVERYONE greets you with a smile and \"Buenos Dias\". No one has the snobby, superior demeanor so often encountered at a five star resort. Heaven!! The kids had a blast at the slide pool and the Kids' Club which has a wonderful staff. The other pools were lovely as they are set up amid a series of walkways and chaise seating areas so that the effect is a series of large pool \"rooms\". Also there is a stunning elevated adult pool off to itself in a gorgeous location. The beach is a whole other environment if you need a change from the pool. Shuttles carry guests back and forth a short distance to the beach area. You can also walk from the hotel on a wide concrete path through the jungle to the beach. Surreal, especially at sunset. Staff sets you up on the beach or at the beach pool and brings you all the food and drink you desire. There is also a lovely large palapa restaurant with an al fresco bar. On the beach you can walk several miles in either direction. As you do you will note that the Mayakoba F. has one of thee best beach locations in Playa del Carmen. The holiday festivities were nothing short of amazing. Suffice to say that the hotel takes its programs VERY SERIOUSLY. I'll never forget the evening when the mayans in full dress cruised up the river chanting and offering incense while a chorus of hotel staff blew conch shell 'horns'. This was preceded by an operetta of Christmas carols and the evening finished off with Mariachis arriving by the boatload. All the while guests were served appetizers and offered a traditional Christmas drink. Very memorable! The travel desk is very helpful, friendly, and again Not Pushy. Enough cannot be said about the incredible service of our concierge Marco.

I decided to stay at the Fairmont Mayakoba after i found a great deal on the web..friends and family and paid $199 per nite (plus numberous tax add ons= total was $253 per nite) We arrived from Newark direct on Continental and paid $650 r/t per person. The plane was filled with children , but that is what we should have expected at that time of year (christmas to new years 2010) I travel quite a bit for work , so i always have high expectations. The hotel was quite large, and i was a bit taken aback when i realized how far it was from the beach. It seemed more like a \"compound\" than a 5-star hotel. My initial opinion warmed after the first day as the layout became more familiar. The food, as other writer's have commented is expensive. You can have breakfast at either Las Brisas or La Luna , both will run you $50 for 2 people (buffet + tip) My mom and I are not huge eaters so we just got coffee and pasteries....we paid $20 per day. We also rented a car, which i do recommend, although that too was quite costly. I rented from ACE RENT A CAR online before we left (booked in October for December travel) and got a rate of $145 for 7 days unlimited mileage. When we arrived at the rent a car place after taking the bus from the airport, they were not too friendly. The car they assigned us too was quite small and manual (good thing i remembered!) + they informed me that there is a \"mandatory\" liability insurance which brough my rate from $145 to 215..i was not a happy camper...so back to the hotel...i requested an upgrade and they said no problem. the check in time was 3pm , i arrived at 3:45pm but room was not ready. They agreed (after i requested) to buy us drinks for our wait...we arrrived at our \"tree house\" at about 4:30pm. The room was very nice, mini-bar (nothing in it which i found quite strange) and nice big bathroom with jacquizzi tub..lots of windows for light, bed was extremely comfortable with sufficient amount of pillows...there were a few things...out on our deck were two cushioned chairs, but the cushions where filled with \"stains\" when i called the front desk they immediately sent someone to remove and wash them...i thought the response was o.k.but i would have preferred to just have clean cushions. I then called to see if there were any casita's on the lagoon (very nice) . No one got back to me and i grew frustrated.. If it's avail, tell me , If there is a charge ,tell me but no communication is not acceptable from a 5 star resort. I also requested dinner reservations at the nearby Rosewood (beautiful!!! although $700 per nite) Mayakoba. Again , i rec'd mixed messages...they are booked until the new year..well, I was there until Jan. 4 so told Yuki at the Conceirge desk, that's fine pls book us the 2nd or the 3rd....never heard back. Finally , I called and said i needed to have resolution in regards to our dinner plans..finally she left me a message , we were booked for El Puerto (at Fairmont) on New Year's Eve at 7:00pm and at the Rosewood restaurant for Jan . 2 ...i shouldn' t have to call back, this is a deluxe resort..so communication is key, as i told the manager who called to apologize after i grew weary of the resort and emailed the head office. On a brighter note..the bikes they have all around the resort are great, although there is only one size bike. You can pick it up at the transportation center, or at the main pool or at the beach and ride it to your destination and then leave it for the next rider. There were fireworks scheduled for New Year's Eve, but when i asked someone at the transportation center where they were, they had no idea. After I asked a second person , they also were confused..i don't blame the individual workers, but the management for not keeping their employees updated. Overall they eventually upgraded our room to a casita on the lagoon . My mom loved it she could feed the fish and looking at the water from the deck was so peaceful and relaxing. The business center, although they said it was \"free\" they do charge you , so again the employee (alexis) who gave me that info was misinformed. They not only charge you for print outs, but they also charge you for use *by time of the computers....Another interesting point is that Playa Del Carmen is about 12 min south of the hotel..there are restaurants there (try the Ladybug) which are a much better value than the hotel. Once reviewing advised \"THE FUSION \" on the beach..i made my mom hike down quite a ways to this hotel / restaurant , but would only rate it mediocre. I also took a drive to TULUM (about 1.15 hours from Mayakoba) since i had friends staying at the Maya Tulum..It reminded me slightly of Costa Rica, but I could see it was becoming too commercialized....restaurant food (zuma's) was not as good as 10 yrs ago, and there were tour buses turning around on the one main road..there also was a bit of litter scattered..so i ask..what's next?

This resort is very nice, and beautifully situated on a gorgeous beach. It may be a bit too heavily skewed towards families, but hard to tell that week, when probably most resorts are teeming with kids. The room was very nice, with a very grand marble bathroom with tons of natural light. We had a deluxe casita rate but were upgraded to a signature Casita and I am not sure how different it was from what we'd booked. The room had an odor for sure, but perhaps in that climate it's unavoidable. Most of the rooms at this hotel are far from and do not overlook the ocean. However, the golf carts ran frequently, and you can also pick up a bike from one of the many racks around the property, and get a few minutes of exercise while riding to the beach (you don;t have to check out the bikes, you just grab one if its available, and leave it at your next spot). The main pool seemed very nice, but it is in the center of the property away from the beach, so we chose not to take advantage of it. Unfortunately, the pool at the beach, while nice, is a bit small (and not heated in winter). The food in the restaurants was good but not excellent. The \"four diamond\" el puerto was actually a big letdown, but others mentioned they had good meals there. We went into town 4 of 6 nights, and highly recommend doing so. The taxi ride is 170 pesos each way, but the restaurants are very reasonable so you make up a little bit of what you would have spent in inflated prices at the hotel (plus it's much more lively and fun in town). The hotel likes to recommend a Mayan place called Yac-she (sp?) but we weren't that impressed. We were much happier just to walk along the main avenue and choose based on the menus we liked. The place was at 100% capacity, and therefore a bit hectic. That being said, the ONLY time it really felt hectic was on the beach...otherwise the property is so spread out you wouldnt know how full it is. Neither having to walk the beach trying to find an empty lounge chair nor waking up early to go down to the beach and hold chairs is very relaxing. It just seemed like a problem that could be fixed by an investment in another 20-25 chairs. When I suggested they bring some chairs down from the adult pool (which was empty, I think because of the location within the resort) they said it would be too hard to move them. While this resort is top notch, if you're the type who likes the best of the best, you may be slightly bothered by the fact that the resort is flanked on either side by superior resorts. The Banyan Tree and Rosewood are smaller, newer, and a cut above (We noticed that both the BT and RW had service people sweeping their beachfronts for trash and kelp, but the Fairmont did not). Those resorts also have more comfy looking lounge chairs on the beach. Apparently during normal weeks the hotel will shuttle you back and forth between those resorts, where you can go for meals, but during xmas they were not allowing this and the restaurants weren't taking reservations from non-guests.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property and grounds a relaxing oasis\u201d", "Author": "Reader62", "ReviewID": "UR52468082", "Content": "Just returned from a wonderful vacation at the Fairmont.

Undoubtedly, the resort is a beautiful property and locale, but... My wife and I were planning to come down for the Christmas week and made reservations in a signature casita when our daughter decided to join us. We contacted the concierge requesting a possible upgrade to a larger suite, and although I understand that the resort was actually full for the holiday week, we were never contacted about lack of availability despite being reassured through mulitple emails that someone would be contacting us and that the hotel staff were working on it. Then despite our having requested queen beds, when we arrived we were told that we had been placed in a king bed, which was not acceptable given our daughter's arrival. We had communicted these specific issues in numerous emails prior to arrival. We then had to wait over 2 hours in the lobby lounge waiting for a room with queen beds to be made available. We were told by desk staff that the reason our room took so long to prepare was because of the \"dirty\" and filthy condition the room had been left in b y the previous vacationers- not the best way to welcome someone to the resort, telling them how dirty the room was you will now be staying in. As we were waiting, both my wife and daughter were devoured by mosquitos in the balcony area of the lobby lounge. The mosquitos were an issue through much of the stay leading us to cancel reservations for outddor dinner activities. We had read a previous review which had reported problems with mosquitos, responded to by hotel staff as reassuring travelers that the problem had been addressed by the scientsits/environmentalists involved in the design of this community. Staff were attentive at times, sometimes too much so, sometimes not as much as would be expected from a five star property. Overall, I would still say the service was favorable, though my wife would disagree. My wife had a bad experience at the spa. She has back problems and made people aware of this on numerous occasions and was reassured that she would feel so much better after a treatment. She was concerned about staff's ability to speak english so that she could let people know about her health concerns and give specific directions concerning what she might be able to tolerate. She was again reassured that this would not be a problem. Unfortunately she tolerated only a few minutes if not moments of her treatment and had to be transported back to our room via cart because she was unable to walk (oxygen was rushed into the room at the spa because staff were uncertain of her medical status). My daughter and I were more fortunate than my wife and had positive experiences at the spa enjoying our treatments. The spa was a wonderful, relaxing environment though treatments were not inexpensive. I would recommend the Cha Cha rain ritual to anyone interested in an incredibly relaxing treatment. There did seem to be pressure exerted by staff to fill open treatment slots, though we were allowed to reschedule or cancel my wife's appointments after her mishap. Also we did wind up putting a block on phone calls to our room, due to repeated calls to confirm various dinner apppointments, golf reservations, and spa treatments. There is a line between attentiveness vs. follow up creating the impression the resort simply wants to make certain they can extract as much in fees as possible for various activities. Again some of this may have been due to the resort being full for parts of the holiday week and the resort wanting to make certain that open slots for various activities were minimized, but it was difficult for my wife to relax in the room with the numerous calls/messages. The room and bathroom were lovelyl, though the marble floor could have been washed and kept cleaner, our feet getting dirty (black) when not wearing the resort provided slippers. food at the resort was good and in my opinion relatively inexpensive for Caribbbean destinations. I suspect that the food bill was less than if we had stayed at an all inclusive with preferrable quality. Our favorite restaurant was the Puerta restaurant which had the widest selections on the menu. My daughter enjoyed the scenic boat ride through the freshwater canals. The beach was crowded the days we went and ideally there could have been additonal lounges made available. Hotel guests should not be left wandering the beach looking for a place to sit which we did see happen. The pools were confortable and afforded some choices if one wanted to get away from children. Overall, I did have a good stay, and would go back to the Mayakoba, hoping that a stay in a suite at the beach might provide an even more enjoyable experience. We stayed for 9 nights in a signature casita and the total bill worked out to a little over $10,000. I left feeling that the Fairmont mayakoba had all the ingredients for a truly exceptional stay, but somehow our stay was not as spectacular as we would have hoped, though definitely above average. Probably for the cost and reputation of other Fairmont properties, the stay did not live up to our expectations. I'll have to see if I can talk my wife into giving it one more try. Right now she feels she would have preferred to freeze at the Plaza in NYC for the holidays, though our daughter feels we may have started a new Carribbean holiday tradition.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Topeka, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel but better places to stay\u201d", "Author": "Kathyks", "ReviewID": "UR52220542", "Content": "The Fairmont Mayakoba is a beautiful resort that is very well maintained.

We only stayed two nights as it was the end of a six night vacation where we stayed the first four at the JW Marriott in Cancun. I wanted to specifically post since we received some excellent service from this property. I have come to expect excellent service from all Fairmont properties and employees in general when making requests, however, this one went above and beyond in my opinion and my experience has shown me that this would probably not have happened at many other hotels. I am not going to go into too much detail on restaurants as such as some previous posters have done an excellent job. We enjoyed an excellent two days of rest and relaxation at this fabulous resort. The grounds are truly impressive, I was on a NFAF promotion so we were paying $119/night and with a suite upgrade had a Signature Casita Suite overlooking the lagoon which was fabulous. Two large rooms and two full bathrooms and large balconies overlooking the water. Our second day we played at the El Camaleon course in Mayakoba which was also excellent. I found the course to be in excellent condition, the greens really ran true. I was able to scramble for an 83 from the white tees!!! Anyway, that afternoon back at the adults infinity pool, we had left our beach bag under out double lounger as we went for lunch. We had lunch at the restaurant nearby which had a terrace and we were always in full view of our lounge chairs, for the most part. I have left my ipod, wife\u2019s ipod and her running watch, among other things in the bag. (I know what some of you are probably thinking, morons!!) Anyway, while seated for lunch we noticed some men with red badges around their neck working in a flower bed near our lounge chairs. Although I commented that I wondered what they were doing so close to our stuff, my wife suggested probably nothing and did we want to accuse workers of theft for merely doing their jobs. We didn\u2019t want to be those type of people!! (Boy were we wrong) Anyway, after a very enjoyable lunch we returned to our area and realized our bag was no longer underneath the lounge but in the corner by the flower bed where the employees were working. After a quick check, I realized my ipod was missing, what was strange was they didn\u2019t take my wife\u2019s ipod. I can only assume they didn\u2019t know what it was since it was inside a Nike running arm band. We also noticed the running watch missing. Just to be sure, I went back to the room and made sure it wasn\u2019t in the safety deposit box, we wanted to make sure before levelling accusations. Upon my return confirming they were no in the room, I alerted the concierge at the pool. The concierge took a brief description and call hotel security. He said to go back to the pool where we were, enjoy the weather and security would be with me shortly. After taking the concierges advice, security showed up about ten minutes later and we provided a description of the items and an explanation of what happened. Security also interviewed a few people around the pool area. (there were only one or two people using this pool) The Manager of loss prevention explained that these were contract workers and that he would be investigating and would stay in touch with me until they recovered our items. I must say, all stay we talked to at the hotel that afternoon and evening were aware of what happened and expressed their apologies as they were all embarrassed of this happening at their hotel (I love the ownership at many Fairmont properties) Anyway, that night I provided the hotel with a written explanation of the events. The Manager of loss prevention called me the next morning to let me know that this would be dealt with and we would be compensated in one way or another. He explained that he was working on things and we should enjoy the last morning of our stay. He also offered us complimentary transportation to the airport if it hadn\u2019t already been arranged. We enjoyed the morning at the pool and checked out around 11am, the Manager of loss prevention sent one of his assistant\u2019s to meet us at check out and wanted to stress that they were working on this would hopefully have a solution shortly. We left for our 40 minute ride to CUN. After checking in at the Air Canada counter and walking to the security line up, who should come running through the doors but the Manager of loss prevention and his assistant. He first apologized for not meeting us at checkout but explained he was in a meeting with the workers and had recovered our items which he had with him and wanted to make sure we had them before we went home. The amount of travelling I do, sometimes, not very often, but sometimes things go missing, I was very pleased to see the commitment of the hotel to do everything they could to recover our items. Other moral of the story is to take our bag with us to lunch next as well. However, my thanks to the Manager of Loss Prevention and the rest of the Mayakoba staff for what I would consider going above and beyond.

Generally stated, the good is that the resort is beautiful. The food is delicious, though not cheap or widely varied. The bad is that the service is good at times, but mediocre at most. The drinks are outrageously priced and under-poured. The golf carts that run are slow, which can be annoying if you're coming back from a trip into the madness that is Mexican traffic, have many bags, or are trying to make a reservation on time. We found biking to be a better option but not ideal when you're not looking to sweat or have much to carry. Also bikes aren't always conveniently distributed. The Mayakoba could do much better on the transport across the resort. The staff is a mixed bag. There are some strong standouts but also a lot who seem to be going through the motions. Many reminded us of automatons who got in the way more than they truly provided service. We were annoyed by the batteau captain who seemed more inclined to sell Mexico and himself than to inform us about the ecosystem. Yes he did give us some insight into the canals, but he we learned more about the fish (tillapia and tarpon) in the canal from a server who was a fisherman himself. The spa is nice but not stellar. I agree with some earlier posts that the massages are excellent. I can recommend that without reservation. The facial I had was not good and defintely not worth the money. My partner enjoyed his massage as well and also liked his \"feet first\" treatment. The mineral pools are nice but not on a par with some of the better spas around. The fitness center is very good. I took a yoga class, which was quite adequate for what you might expect at a resort. The restaurants are beautiful, but limited. La Liguna has very good dinner entrees and a quite awesome breakfast buffet, but expect to pay $14 for a mediocre glass of wine. La Puerto was good but they disappointed me when they inquired whether we were celebrating a special occassion and failed to respond in any way to the fact that it was my s/o's 40th birthday. That was one of the less than impressive service moments. Housekeeping was adequate but inconsistent. We never recovered a coffee mug that we were missing after leaving it on the balcony one morning. Also on our final day our itinerary was thrown away--an inconvenience that cost us unnecessary time in the business center. The pools are very nice generally but too cold while we were there during the winter. This would be more tolerable if there were hot tubs, but there aren't except in the locker rooms at the spa, which you can only access if you've had a spa treatment or pay $25 for a day's access. The beach was nice, but at the time we were there had much trash on it. I realize things wash up and the resort can't totally combat that, but it still was a detraction. Our last day we were confronted with a major Eastern seaboard blizzard that seemed likely to disable our travel. Marco, the concierge, was amazingly competent, patient, and resourceful. He did much to improve our impression of the resort. If you go, try to seek him out because the others were not terribly helpful. One female concierge sent us to a pretty bad restaurant and failed to adequately explain parking conventions in Playa del Carmen even though we explicitly asked. I know the resort is high on Yatxe (sp) but despite it great ambiance, the food was pretty horrendous. Some other tips: if you rent a car, rent from Hertz because they waive the vallet parking fee. If you get a parking ticket (we did), know that they take your back license plate and be prepared to try to find the unmarked police station to retreive it. Also in town Fusion on the beach has amazing food, a great vibe, and very reasonable prices. Out of PdC, we enjoyed Puetro Aventura for it's low stress, good value environment. A special standout was Gringo Daves. They cooked our freshly caught fish for free and charged us only $5 for a wide array of sauces on our fish, rice, and great grilled veggies. Lastly don't fall for the insurance the rental cars try to railrod you into and if you do rent from Hertz, don't bother with the guys/girls who try to shanghai you with claims of disounts, free tickets and food, etc. It may be legit offers, but we learned it's a time share and chose not to increase our aggravation with the Mexican hussle on vacation.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westchestry Cty, NY", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice, and Very Quite\u201d", "Author": "MMRDAR5", "ReviewID": "UR50244883", "Content": "\u2022 We just returned for a week at the property, we all enjoyed ourselves; however, the hotel was not very busy, and at times the kids were looking for what to do.

We've been to some pretty amazing resorts in the past and the Fairmont Mayakoba was right up there with the best. The property is massive and the layout a little confusing - but apparently it was designed not to interfere with the existing ecosystem. That resulted in a unique jungle-like setting with lots of waterways and wildlife right at your front door. The resort was pretty empty and it rained for the first few days thanks to Hurricane Ida (and cloudy the rest of the time) but that didn't bother us too much given how nice our room was! ROOMS - We stayed in one of the Signature Casitas (Coral Suite - Room 644) which overlooked the mangroves. The suite was absolutely massive at around 1,000 square feet. The bathrooms (yes, plural) were very cool with glass walls that gave you the feeling of showering outside. Don't worry though. You're surrounded by jungle so no one can see in. 24 hour room service with a big menu is always nice too... SERVICE - The service was fantastic. Can't think of anything negative to say! Everyone seemed to know it was our 2 year anniversary despite only mentioning it to one staff member! There was the occasional error on our dinner bills but they were fixed immediately. Nothing to worry about. CLEANLINESS - The entire resort was spotless. Our suite was cleaned 3x a day - no issues with house keeping. We like new things and this resort was only a few years old. Everything was brand new. BEACH - The beach was awesome but a 15 minute walk from the main resort, unless you were lucky enough to get a suite right on the beach. Luckily golf carts came by every 5 minutes to take you back and forth. A great restaurant (Las Brisas) and pool right on the beach made the trip worth it. They even brought us snacks (fruit cups) and cucumber eye patches while relaxing on the beach. FOOD - The food was absolutely amazing 10/10. Best we've ever had. It is expensive but the portions are big so you get your money's worth. My wife is a vegetarian and thought there would be nothing for her to eat, but she was blown away. Las Brisas has the best atmosphere and view of the beach but El Puerto (in the main building) had the best food. We stocked up on drinks and snacks at the cafe located at the main pool. Be sure to try the Chocolate Chip muffins ;) SPA - The spa was first-class. My wife went back for a second maternity massage. Worth every penny. ENTERTAINMENT - Unfortunately there wasn't any. During dinner, there was always live music, which was great, but not the \"shows\" that other resorts typically have. We were just there to relax, so we really didn't care about the lack of entertainment. The resort was pretty empty but we didn't mind. We took a one-hour private boat tour around the resort one morning which was really fun. The \"Venice of the Caribbean\"... VALUE - Definitely a 5+ star resort. If you're looking to relax, the Fairmont Mayakoba is the place for you. We would definitely recommend for a Honeymoon but not so much for a large group looking to party.

This was our second trip. We stayed in the deluxe casita, which was closer to the beach and also afforded more privacy. The rooms were extremely large, with two queen beds and a fridge that could be stocked with items purchased on-site, or with supplies you bring with you. The bathroom was also very large, with a huge soaking tub that looks out onto a garden area (if you are on the ground floor). The view from the tub in the upstairs rooms is only of a wooden screen, but the light comes in and it is also quite nice. The opposite end of the room opens via sliding door to a patio or balcony. It is wonderful to sit there in the morning and listen to the many exotic birds. The view from the Deluxe Casita is of the jungle, which some people have criticized, but I found it wonderfully secluded and relaxing. The room is also equipped with electric kettle and Bodin coffee maker as well as a teapot. The property is quite spread out, and you get around by golfcart or bicycles. There are several pools, including an adults only pool. My only criticism of the pools is that the beachside pool is rather small, and there are no hot tubs at any of the pools (there is a hot tub in the spa facility, but you must have booked a treatment that day to have access. The restaurants are OK, fairly expensive. The beachside burgers, guacamole, etc are fine. Poolside drinks are great-try the Miami Vice and add a little extra rum-delicious!

Only 3 restaurants (plus a lounge and cafe), so dining choices are limited for a stay of more than the 3 days we were there, especially if one of the restaurants is closed for a private event -- several business groups file through here, though they were small, a few dozen people, so it didn't feel like a \"conference center\" hotel. You can dine at the restaurants at the neighboring resorts, though we decided to stick with the Fairmont restaurants after we learned that kids (under 6? I think?) eat free! The surf is stronger at this beach than at Mamita's in Playa, where we had spent a week at a condo just prior to this resort, so our little ones preferred the pools. One nice thing about the pools is a series of alcoves (think railroad ties) that are quite private, even while being part of the big pool. Great water slide; kids club is just aiight. Rooms are beautiful and very private, surrounded by the forest: it feels like you're in your own cabana, even though the casitas share walls like townhouses. A nice change of pace from Cancun.

When I say the site is exceptional, pictures and video available on the Fairmont website are exactly what you get... Service is impeccable from the rooms to frontdesk to pools , beaches and restaurants... We ate every morning and night at The Laguna, which offers enough variety but exceptional quality for the price you pay...I can not rave enough about the service and food...Travelling with 2 young ones and a teenager sometimes is difficult to please everyone...Both my wife and I could enjoy great food while the kids would feast on anything from the3 kids menu or just enjoy a fabulous Laguna burger. We had exceptional service from the hostesses Viridiana and Aliser, who would always welcome us with huge smiles and hugs for our two daughters, while servers Fabiola,Jose, Alfonso, Iran and others were just so attentive its was unbelievable.

Never would you have to wait more than 5 minutes to get from one place to the other. Having walked south on the beach and having seen other locations, the Fairmont offers BY FAR the nicest strand of beach with crisp turquoise and blue water ( there are some small rocks for which you have to be careful and find the right spot in the water). Rooms are huge and beautifully decorated with enormous washrooms. It is very elegant and pleasing to the eye. Travelling a lot and staying in hotels all the time, much to my astonishment I must say that the AC was exceptionnally efficient as I did not suffer from the usual dryness or even clogged nose... There are numerous pools ( a couple infinity ones) around the resort and all were clean and beautiful..The kids especially enjoyed the one with the slide..

The security and architecture of the entrance to the hotel was very impressive. It makes you feel like a VIP everytime you drive up. The lobby was beautiful. The staff was extremely attentive from the time you get there until the time you leave. Without asking, when we checked in, we were given a free upgrade to a casita. However, when we got there, it was a casita on the lower level that had a private porch with a view of trees and the sidewalk. We decided to ask for an upgrade to an upper level casita. They gave us the option to upgrade to an upper level casita on the lagoon for $50USD. When we got to the new room, it was an upper level casita on the lagoon, but half of the lagoon view was blocked by trees growing out of the lagoon. As far as we can see, no other casita had their lagoon view half blocked by shrubs. Since we were tired and exhausted at this point, we decided to stay. The room was beautiful and felt luxurious in a rustic way. The bathroom was amazing! It had double sinks, a large soaking tube, a separate standing shower with a \"rainfall\" shower head and a hand held sprayer, a water closet, and marble tiling throughout. When we went to the cafe by the pool to grab something to eat, we found the food was extremely expensive. Their pre-made gourmet sandwiches were more than $9USD! My husband got one of those sandwiches and I decided to get pre-made a ceasar salad. The girl brought it the register, then pickup the container with the dressing said something to her coworker. They said something back and forth in spanish, and she took it to the back. Ten minutes later, she came back with a bigger container, with a dressing that was white. The original dressing was yellow, which is the correct color for a ceasar dressing, considering the main ingredient is egg yolk. She placed it in our bag and flashed us a huge smile. Needless to say, I was AFRAID to eat the dressing and we never went back to the cafe. The maid service comes twice a day. Once in the morning and once at night to refresh the room. The first time the maid came after we settled in, the bathtub and shower had an unbearable mildew/mold smell. The glass cups on the night stand also had a very strong moldy smell. We also found a small lizard in the water closet, which we tried to catch with a cup so that we could set it free, unfortunately it was too quick. Poor guy! The beach is unbelievable! The sand is white and soft. The water is light turquoise green and very warm. It rivals the beaches in Tahiti. Relaxing under the shade from the umbrella, staring out at the white sand and beautiful water, and being served pina coladas by an outstanding server...we felt like we were in paradise. We did rent a car so we were able to come and go as we pleased. Since the hotel is not in walking in distance of any restaurants, shops, or activities, I believe we would\u2019ve felt too isolated if we didn\u2019t have a car. Even though the beach is gorgeous, we\u2019re too active to just relax on the beach several days in a row. Also like other reviewers, we believe that the food is good but it would be very financially draining to eat most of your meals there. The avg price for an entr\u00e9e is $15USD. For each order, there is an additional $5USD delivery charge, 10% government tax, and 15% gratuity added. Just so that you can gauge, a really good made-to-order taco at a local restaurant around Playa del Carmen is $6 peso or $0.50 USD. Even at this price, we were still getting ripped off! If you went to the local modern (very nice) supermarket and bought gourmet deli smoked turkey (the best brand that you could buy), gourmet grueyere cheese, apples, bananas, gourmet pasteries, Rambutan (exotic fruit), a bottle of moderate French wine, and a baguette, it would cost $19USD. Bottom line, make sure you rent a car, rest assure that there are plenty of great food and shopping options a few miles away in Playa del Carmen, and BARGAIN.

Also, with only 3 restaurants on site, the lack of variety over the course of a week did get tiring.

First, we got very reasonable rates at this time of year (summer is Cancun's slow season) and due to the swine-flu & economic downturn, flights were relatively cheap too. The Mayakoba is about 30 mins. south of the airport, and 15 mins. north of Playa del Carmen. Renting a car is essential, as there are so many actives (snorkeling at Xel-Ha, Mayan ruins at Tulum & Chichen Itza, dining off-site in Cancun or Playa del Carmen) all require driving. Even renting a car was extremely cheap ($75 for a week's rental not counting insurance). We've stayed at five star hotels throughout the world and already know that Mexican service/hospitality is arguably the best in general. The staff at the Fairmont were the best of the best. We ate most meals at the hotel's three restaurants. La Laguana is for breakfast and casual dinner. Las Brisas is on the beach and higher end, fusion. We only ate at Las Brisas once for dinner and it was adequate but nothing special. One of the hotel's finest assets is the El Puerto restaurant and the waiter named Felipe. I can say unequivocally that he is the best waiter we've ever had. We ended up eating here three times and he remembered what we ordered at previous meals and made recommendations based upon our personal tastes. We celebrated our wedding anniversary here one night and it was perfect: unbelievable service, beautiful setting on the patio overlooking the water on a cool night and very tasty food that pleased our entire party. The layout of the hotel is a bit unusual. The resort is spread over a wide area and taking carts (driven by hotel staff) is necessary to get from the lobby to rooms, to restaurants and to the beach or pools. While this seems unorthodox, it works well and you never have to wait long for a cart to come take you where you want to go. The payoff is that privacy is enhanced and you never get the sense of being in a crowd. The first few nights we stayed in a deluxe room in the 500s which was very nice. Through the Fairmont's presidents club we got a free suite upgrade for the last 5 nights and we were given a beach-front 1 bed-room cabana. (!) Easily the nicest room we've ever stayed in. Right on the beach with a private pool, ample space and wonderful in every way. The stay would have been terrific even without the suite upgrade, but this was unbelievable.

I had contacted reservations and the concierge by email prior to arrival and they promptly took care of all my requests. On arrival, we were shocked to receive the ultimate in upgrades to the El Cameleon presidential suite on the beach. The suite was huge and had a 800 square foot private terrace with a view of and access to the beach. We had activities planned in the Riviera Maya area but cancelled them so we could spend more time enjoying the suite. The manager at Las Brisas restaurant allowed us to stay on the patio after close on our first night and continued bar service. And the following day, Las Brisas was closed for dinner (due to low occupancy, around 20%) but the staff arranged a table beachside for us. It was just one example how the staff went that extra step to make our stay memorable. We also dined at Casa Del Lago at Rosewood during our stay (the Fairmont provided free transportation) which was very nice. Previous posters have complained about the high prices for dining at Mayakoba but I actually found it to be quite reasonably priced for a 4/5 star resort. To address another common complaint, yes most of the rooms are a bit of a walk from the beach. But with any amount of research, people should have been aware of this before booking. We found the bike transportation a fun way to get around and we never had to wait long for a golf cart. And finally, I've read complaints about the $25 a day 'resort fee' charge. This is actually a minor charge in comparison to the additional 10-15% service charge that other resorts such as Rosewood, Mandarin Oriental, and Maroma add onto ALL services. The gym and the spa are nice but the massage I received was just average. I wouldn't recommend the boat tour on the lagoon either. The beach is gorgeous and was not crowded at all when we were there. The ocean is rocky in a couple places but is fine as you move away from the shore. There was a nice breeze in the evenings which kept the mosquitoes away (I didn't see one during my stay). If you're looking for a quiet, relaxing place to stay in the Riviera Maya area, I would highly recommend checking out the Fairmont Mayakoba.

Fantastic experience! The Fairmont Mayakoba is located on the Yucatan's Mayan Riviera near Playa del Carmen. The Mayakoba property is quite large and absolutely stunning and it's impressive that such a large place with so many outbuildings (the \"casitas\" that make up the accommodations) was given such care to fit in to its beautiful natural surroundings of mangrove forest and water. And the gorgeously designed open-air lobby building with its spectacular views of the property and the ocean defies description. Simply beautiful. The property is criscrossed by canals, which can be used to ferry guests around the property (don't miss the 8am boat trip around the property. We saw crocodiles, storks, turtles and iguanas on that trip alone.) Guests can also move about the property on bicycles that are provided or simply walk the lovely walkways to get to the restaurants, spa, pools or beach. There are also golf carts that will pick you up at many locations every five minutes and drive you to your destination. The beach is a 10-minute walk from the main property and is clean, beautiful and well-attended. There's a pool and restaurant right above the beach, so you could spend the entire day there. Back on the main property, there are a number of other pools, including the stunning infinity pool (adults only) that overlooks a large canal populated with cormorants and other sea birds. We spent most of our trip parked there, on their luxurious padded beach chaises. There are three main restaurants on the property, varied in their menus and all good quality, if pricey. There's also a small cafe that serves coffee and sandwiches and supplies some grocery items. We opted to take a taxi to Walmart in Playa del Carmen our first night (thanks to a tip from a TripAdvisor reviewer) and stocked up on water and groceries, saving a lot of money we would have spent at the restaurants. The resort is not within walking distance of any other restaurants or shops, so you either eat at the hotel restaurants, take a taxi to a restaurant at Playa del Carmen nearby or fill your room fridge with groceries. The rooms are large and comfortable and beautifully furnished and all have balconies overlooking pools or canals (on our last night while we sat drinking wine on our balcony, a 6-foot crocodile leisurely swam by in the canal below us.) There doesn't seem to be a bad view anywhere on the property. And because the casitas are nestled into the large property, you have a great deal of privacy and a sense that you're the only guests at the resort. As great as all of these things were, the real reason to stay at the Mayakoba is for the service. I have never stayed anywhere before where the staff was as gracious, accommodating, courteous and professional. I have no idea what kind of training they go through, but whatever it is, the Fairmont is doing it right. I've had wonderful service at the Fairmont in Bermuda and in San Jose, CA, but this just exceeded all our expectations. They were the nicest, friendliest staff who never questioned a request from us and accommodated us as efficiently and quickly as they could every time. We were treated like special guests by everyone there, something so often missing in hotel experiences. One note: the Mayakoba charges $15/US/day per guest for service. That means that you don't have to tip every person who helps you with something during the trip. Given how much assistance you get there (golf cart drivers, bellmen, cleaning staff, beach/pool staff, etc.) this was great, because we didn't have to constantly remember to carry small bills and tip each person separately. It made the whole trip more relaxing. Loved it and would go back in a heartbeat. I highly recommend the Mayakoba for your next trip to Mexico!! -Jennifer", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston, texas", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable\u201d", "Author": "hobbiezm", "ReviewID": "UR30976166", "Content": "Upon my return from Fairmont Maykoba, I happened to read the review from the earlier post dated Memorial Day 2009; I couldn't have written it better myself.

I spend almost 100 nights in hotel rooms each year and only rarely post reviews on Tripadvisor. Only occasionally do I feel my insights can add to the already lengthy body of information available here on virtually any hotel or resort worldwide. However, I knew I would post a review of the Fairmont Mayakoba even before I arrived there. Why? Well, it seemed to me that there were far too few detailed reviews of this hotel among the dozens of pages of submissions. Most reviewers described the hotel as 'outstanding' or 'disappointing' without providing the kind of information that can really be of help to those planning a stay here. For that reason, I will go into quite a bit of detail on what we experienced during our stay at the Fairmont over Memorial Day weekend. Our trip to Riviera Maya was planned last minute - about a week in advance. It came as no surprise that Mexico was by far the cheapest destination where one could reasonably spend a long weekend. Thank you swine flu. Our rate at the Fairmont Mayakoba was unreal. We paid less than half of discounted low season rates. I feel it's important to note this in a hotel review, because I truly believe the rate one pays has a huge impact on their perception of a resort, particularly when it comes to service. According to one of the many staff members we encountered during our stay, occupancy rates for the weekend we were there were around 20 percent. This is also of note, as our experience may have been different at 100 percent occupancy or even 50 percent occupancy. We enjoy staying at resorts around the world during their 'low seasons' and enjoy the peace and extra attention that comes with staying at a sparsely populated property. Arrival: We arrived by rental car from Cancun airport after an approximately 35 minute drive. The Fairmont is one of four resorts (one is currently under construction) in the Mayakoba Development. It is also the largest and the least expensive. The other resorts currently in operation in Mayakoba -- Rosewood and Banyan Tree -- both have only about 100 rooms and rates in the $1,000 per night range. The Mandarin Oriental is adjacent to Mayakoba but outside the development. Anyone entering Mayakoba must clear a security checkpoint. From there, it's a short drive along winding stone and concrete roads to the Fairmont reception. There are lighted signs to guide you, but the text is a bit small. Reception/Check-In: From the moment we emerged from our vehicle, we were greeted by name. Presumably, the security guard at the front notified the hotel staff we were enroute. We were presented with cool towels car side. Our bags were literally whisked away. By the time I got around to the trunk, they were gone. At the entrance to the expansive, open air lobby, we were presented with a non-alcoholic welcome drink on a tray. It was fruity and refreshing. Again, at each step along the way, we were greeted by name. Given our ultra-cheap rate, I was a bit concerned that we would be assigned the most basic room. In fact, we were told by the front desk clerk that we were upgraded to a 'casita.' After taking care of the paperwork, we were introduced to Hugo, who walked us to a balcony overlooking the entire resort and briefly described the layout. Hugo then escorted us to a golf cart and drove us to our second-level casita near the heart of the property. Once we arrived at our room, he gave us a brief tour of the room and explained how to work the AC, lights, ceiling fan, etc. As Hugo was leaving, our bags arrived, and the bellman placed them directly in the closets. Room: Our casita was spacious and thoughtfully designed. A king bed, sitting chair, and desk furnished the main room, along with a credenza with drawers, cabinets, a refrigerator and a flat panel LCD TV. The bed was very pleasant and on par with a five-star resort. I can see how some might complain about firmness, but it didn't bother me at all. High speed internet access was hard wired and worked well (at US$20 per day, but complimentary for Presidents Club members, which is a great deal).Three phones, one cordless. An awesome Bose sound system with an auxiliary jack for iPods or Mp3 players (not a dock, you actually need your own mini jack to mini jack cord to make this work). Air conditioner was efficient and kept the room very cool. There was also a variable-speed ceiling fan above the bed. A short hallway led to the bathroom with full size closets on either side. This was great, as my girlfriend and I each had a place to store our clothes. There was a safe in one closet big enough to fit my laptop computer, although I had to angle it to get it inside. The bathroom, as mentioned by others, was truly remarkable. It included a double vanity (very large with tons of counter space), a deep soaking tub (no jets), a water closet, and an oversized shower with a bench and a rain-type faucet on the ceiling, in addition to a handheld faucet. The complimentary shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap were Miller-Harris, very high end. The most impressive feature were the huge windows above the bath and in the shower. A wood screen outside maintains privacy while housing a small stone garden and allowing bathers a view of the sky. In the morning, the warm sun streamed into the shower. At night, we could see the stars while soaking in the tub. The floors were solid surface throughout (not tile, maybe polished limestone?). On the opposite side of the room, outside sliding glass doors, was a large wooden lanai with a small seating area of two comfortable chairs and end table. View/Balcony: Very few (and only the most expensive) rooms have ocean views. This is the case for the Rosewood and the Mandarin Oriental, as well. All of the newer resorts in this stretch of Riviera Maya were required to maintain much of the original mangroves and foliage. The mangroves also protect the resorts from hurricanes. These are not large buildings on an ocean like you see in Cancun. These are sprawling resorts with rooms nestled in mangroves or on lagoons. Know this going in. If you're looking for an ocean view, be prepared to pay $1000/night for an oceanfront villa (with private pool), or look elsewhere. Our room overlooked a thatch of thick trees. On the second level, we were almost at the tree tops. The trees provided an exceptional amount of privacy. We virtually could not be seen by anyone else when sitting on our balcony. We also enjoyed spotting colorful birds and iguanas in the trees. Bugs were, for the most part, only a problem at dusk. I would recommend bringing and using insect repellent if you want to sit outside at dusk. Otherwise, our balcony was very comfortable and, again, very private, and we enjoyed spending much time there. Other casitas have lagoon views. The main hotel building has a resort view. Property: Because the resort is sprawling, getting around can be a challenge (or part of the adventure, depending on how you look at it). From our casita, we could easily walk to the lobby, central pools, and main hotel restaurant. The beach (with the best pool and restaurant) is about 3/4th of a mile down a concrete path that winds through mangroves and over lagoons. If you don't want to walk, you have two options: you can pick up one of a number of bikes scattered around the property (I'd say we could easily find at least two bikes 75 percent of the time we looked for them), or you can wait for one of many golf cart shuttles that circle the property. We never waited more than two or three minutes for a golf cart. There are covered areas near each casita where you can phone for one, but we never waited long enough to do this. Let me be clear, for us -- two young people who like adventure and activity -- getting around the property was never a problem and actually provided a number of joyful moments. Pool: There are five pools on the property: a small pool near the resort building, a kids' pool near the kid activity center, a sprawling pool with fountains and bridges, a slide and swim up bar in the center of the property, an adults only, infinity pool overlooking a lagoon, and the oceanfront pool, also infinity, on the beach. We spent our entire weekend at the beach pool. It was never overcrowded. We would arrive around late morning or midday and have our pick of chairs. That said, it is a relatively small pool, and, as it's the most popular, I can imagine it would be difficult to secure a good spot when occupancy levels are higher. All the pools were luxurious and looked wonderful, but we wanted to be able to look out at the ocean while we swam and sunbathed. That said, I probably would have been just as happy at the adult pool. Attendants handle dressing the lounge chairs in towels and provide a rolled towel for a pillow, which we thought was great. A waiter makes the rounds fairly frequently taking drink and food orders -- not as frequently as at some resorts I've been to, but frequently enough to be of service. Our second day poolside, cucumber slices and ice pops were handed out complimentary. Spa/Fitness: We toured the spa and it looked magnificent. We didn't end up booking procedures because it was fairly pricey (US$129-US$149 for 60 minute massage, although they presented us with a $25 gift certificate at check in) and we were just as happy spending our time by the pool. I won't go into much detail about the spa, but one of the best and most unusual features seemed to be the co-ed, rooftop pool and hot tub, which would be a great place to spend time with a loved one after a treatment. The fitness center was well equipped with treadmills, elliptical machines, and stationary bikes. Each machine had a personal TV. Towels and bottled water were placed at each machine by an attendant. There were also the requisite compliment of free weights and weight machines. There are two or three fitness classes each day that are complimentary. There is a US$10 charge per person, per day to use the fitness center. The charge is waived, though, for Presidents Club members. It is absolutely free to join the Presidents Club, and pays off in many ways, including free internet. This should be your first priority after booking a reservation at any Fairmont. Food: Much has been said about the food at Fairmont Mayakoba, positive and negative. But, again, it seemed to me that few shared the kind of detail that would be really helpful -- like exactly HOW expensive the food is. Bottom line, the prices are on par with a five-star resort, maybe a bit cheaper thanks to the Peso. If you stay at a five-star resort, you must expect the food and drinks to be pricey. There are plenty of all-inclusives in this area (and nice ones), if that's what you're looking for. The night we arrived, we dined at Las Brisas, one of two AAA four diamond restaurants on property. (The other AAA four diamond, El Puerto, was closed for the week due to the low occupancy rates. This was a disappointment, but understandable.) Even though our reservation at Las Brisas was at 10p, making us the last couple to dine, the service was absolutely impeccable. Again, we were greeted by name by the hostess and the waiter (Freddie). The dining room is very nice, set in a soaring palapa with rich dark wood everywhere. Of course, we began with margaritas (ranging in price from US$9 to US$12). They were great -- not the best ever -- but very good. We were presented with a complimentary amuse bouche (a nice touch, but unmemorable). Appetizers were in the US$10 to US$20 range. We had a tuna and yellowtail tartare which was plentiful and very fresh. Most entrees were between US$20 and US$30, with some, like Caribbean lobster, much more expensive. I dined on short ribs (US$27), which were very tasty and perfectly cooked. My companion had seafood couscous (US$32), which I tasted and liked a small bit more than my own choice. The shellfish with the dish was plentiful and absolutely perfectly cooked. As we finished our entrees, Freddie suggested that we ordered a passion fruit souffle, which takes extra preparation time. We took him up on the offer and I was very happy we did. It was served with homemade ice cream and really remarkable. I loved it from top to bottom. I recall it was around US$10 or US$15. The only slight surprise on the bill was a US$10 charge per large bottled water (we had two). It is important to note that the Fairmont has it's own supply of clean, safe drinking water and, by law, all ice served in any restaurant must be from purified water. From that point on, we drank tap water and never had a problem. The following morning, we dined at La Laguna for breakfast. Not great, not horrible -- somewhere in between. They offered a buffet, but we ordered a la carte. Most a la carte breakfasts were in around US$12 or US$15. I also ordered a basket of Mexican breads and pastries that was tasty and plentiful for US$5. Orange juice was US$4 per glass. I ordered the breakfast burrito, my girlfriend had the Mexican hash skillet. The food was very good. The service was a little sluggish, although there was a large, somewhat needy party at the next table. Overall, it seemed that the service staff would have preferred we just order the buffet and seemed inconvenienced by the need to serve us a la carte. Again, certainly friendly service, just a little sluggish. On the second day of our stay, we dined poolside at the beach (amazing guacamole with salsa and chips for US$10 and really, really good ceviche for US$17). Drinks poolside were nicely prepared, especially the pina colada. Again, US$9 to US$12 for margaritas and frozen drinks, US$6 for local beer. I'm a big tequila fan and was swilling a pretty pricey number on Saturday afternoon, at US$15 per shot. It was good, but not my favorite. Before leaving, we dined at the lobby bar. Had the guacamole again and a fairly large cheese and mushroom pizza (US$17), which tasted like something I could make at home with a pre-packaged crust. Margaritas in the lobby bar were tasty. Try the Cadillac or the Mango. Off property, we dined in Playa del Carmen at Yaxtche (great meal, and a good value at around US$60 with drinks and dessert). We also dined at Ambar at the Mandarin Oriental (also excellent, a little pricer than Las Brisas -- we went kind of crazy since it was our last night, and they also had really good martinis, so our tab topped US$300). Both of our off property choices were arranged and recommended by the concierge desk. There is 24-hour room service, which we did not try. Also, there is no mini bar in the room, but you can go to the resort's market and cafe and pick out items that they will stock for you in your refrigerator and replenish each day. We also did not do this. We did purchase some alcohol in duty free on the way and made drinks in the room to save a bit on the prices. Service: Really, really top notch. Some highlights: Marco, the concierge, who I communicated with via email before our arrival to arrange dinner reservations; Ricardo, the boat driver who took us on a really cool 45-minute lagoon tour (free, just make a reservation in advance), slowed down the boat to point out all sorts of fish, birds and neat features of the man-made lagoon cut into limestone and connected to underground rivers, and was very patient in answering all of our questions; and Alfredo at the front desk who had security open the gift shop after hours so my girlfriend could get some Advil (delivered directly to the room with no extra charge). Everyone was warm and friendly and it made for such a pleasant experience. I cannot imagine anyone complaining about service at this resort. Calls for bellmen or service are responded to promptly, somewhat surprising considering how large and spread out the resort is. Housekeeping comes twice a day, and leaves bottled water around the room. After calling, valet had our car waiting out front by the time we reached the lobby. The lone service hiccup was at breakfast mentioned above. And, the warm 'Hola' extended by virtually everyone (again, often followed by our names) made for such a happy experience for us both. Checkout: Quick and easy. Honestly, this is the first time I can ever recall being in Latin America and not finding errors on the bill. We finished lunch in the lobby bar and immediately walked to the front desk to check out and our tab from lunch was already on my account. Most hotels in the U.S. can't even accomplish this. Be aware that there is a US$15 daily resort fee that includes gratuities (although we did tip regularly, and more for particularly exceptional service -- i.e., 50 pesos (around US$4) for housekeeping each day, 100 pesos for the boat ride). Valet parking is US$14/day. U.S. currency is widely accepted on property. The front desk will exchange currency at competitive rates with no surcharge. The ATM on property dispenses U.S. currency. Billing is done in pesos, with a conversion at the bottom. So, after all this, why doesn't Fairmont Mayakoba earn five stars? For my girlfriend, it was the breakfast at La Laguna -- a service hiccup that kind of stuck with us. For me, there was one really big, glaring problem that was constantly an issue. The bath towels are way below par for a 5-star resort. One of the things I love most about high end hotels are large, plush bath towels. The bath towels at Fairmont Mayakoba are neither. In fact, they were stiff and kind of scratchy -- consistently same each day. What's really remarkable is that the towels at the pool are large and soft. There must be some sort of issue in the laundry process. Attention really needs to be paid to this. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to return, especially on a good deal.

With all of the lagoons and jungle walkways, you would not expect it to be a very kid-friendly place, however I found myself kept awake at night by shrieking children (or banshees, more appropriately) who apparently were running rampant throughout the resort at all hours of the night. They also took over the pools and common areas so there was not an ounce of feeling of relaxation. We spent over $100 on dinner that you couldn't pay me to eat again, in fact it made me quite ill. The staff was great, though they all seemed nervous that someone would complain about something. In fact, none of the guests appeared happy at all at this resort, though I suspect it is just the kind of people this place attracts and not the the resort or it's staff. At checkout we were charged twice for the room and then charged for valet parking after we were given no option but to valet on arrival. On this trip my husband and I stayed in 3 resorts in the Riviera Maya and this was by far the worst, though it was the most expensive of all. I do not recommend this resort at all, unfortunately.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upper Coverdale, New Brunswick", "Title": "\u201cAmazing looking resort\u201d", "Author": "eknighton", "ReviewID": "UR26535882", "Content": "My spouse and I, as well as his parents stayed here from March 1-5th for a Business Convention. It is very beautiful and luxurious. It is set among mangrove jungle and underground rivers and covers over 200 acres. Most of the rooms are casitas which have a room upstairs and downstairs, some of them are set along the canals. You have to do a lot of walking at this resort since everything is so spread out. It was a 20 minute walk to the beach from our room which was near the lobby/convention centre building but we would always hop on a golf cart or take a bike. The carts go by every few minutes and if you see a bike, you just take it and leave it at the bike rack where you stop. The beach is beautiful and you can walk for miles in either direction. I never actually went in the water at the beach though since it was quite cool and very windy that day. They have a restaurant, and pool at the beach. They have a restaurant and a huge maze like pool near the middle of the resort and an adults only pool overlooking the canal. There is also another restaurant in the lobby but I never saw it open. There is also another pool by the lobby that I never went near. The rooms are beautiful. We stayed in a casita that was not on the canal. It was on the ground floor so we didn't have a view of anything but trees. Too huge closets to store your stuff in. 4 of us stayed in one room comfortably. There is a mini fridge but they don't stock it. There is a safe big enough to store your laptop. The bathroom was beatiful behind 2 large wooded sliding doors, it opens up into a marble bathroom with an atrium taking up one wall beside the soaker tub. The is the benefit of being on the groud floor since the rooms upstairs only have a small window in the bathroom. Toilet was seperated by a door so that more than one person could the facilites. 2 sinks, soaker tub and a huge walkin shower with glass wall and rainfall shower head. Food was great, not all inclusive but the prices weren't too bad actually. They have a great fitness centre and spa. We had a couples message that was terrific. When you have a spa treatment, you also get to use the pool and hot tub on the spa roof that is open until 8pm. All the other pools at the resort close at 5 amd there is no other hot tub to use. I beleive you can pay $25 a day if you want to use the spa facilites. The resort was great except that it really got quite boring at night. There is no entertainment, and the bars were always empty and closed early. We ended up just going back to our rooms most nights to watch tv and go to sleep early. The resort seemed really empty, but maybe because it is so spread out....I probably wouldn't bring my kids here either. Nothing for them to do and so much walking... They have a great golf course here. Some of the holes are right at the beach. They actually a pga tournament going on during our stay.

The people at this resort were always trying to make us comfortable and tending to every need. For anyone like myself that wants a comparison to Hawaii......here you go. The beach at the Mayakoba was the most beautiful I have ever seen. The white beach and the green/blue water was something I have never seen. The lounge chairs and huts on the beach were so comfortable. My husband is a shade guy so it was wonderful to have this for free. (the shade was $35 per day at my last resort in Maui) The men that served food and drinks at the beach were very friendly and I thought the prices were reasonable. The rooms were very nice. The bathroom was a focal point. I took pictures from every angle to show friends at home. The bed and pillows were great. We had a view of the lagoon which was nice. A lot of people have written in about the long walk to the beach. The golf carts take you anywhere you want to go and they drive by often. We never waited more than 5 or 6 minutes for a cart and we were told that the resort was completely full. There were only a couple things I would recommend for this resort. The pools were a bit cold. I am sure this is nice when it's hot in the summer but we had very pleasant weather, 85 or so. The pool was too cold. The other thing is there is a deli next to the pool but it is very limited on items. There needs to be more snack items and more variety.

Very windy at beach (in March) Do not go expecting to lounge in Caribbean type waters... very choppy, but still beautiful The resort does not offer any water sports at all Best restaurants are in Playa del Carmen, a 15 minute cab ride No lobby bar....place is desolate at 9 pm. Pools are not heated...very cold. So if the beach is choppy and the pools are freezing....not too many places to comfortably cool off.

For the past several years, we have stayed at the Fairmont Pierre Marques in Acapulco. We will return to the Pierre Marques next year. Pros: -We had a beautiful one bedroom suite with lagoon and jungle views. We were able to sit on our extra large balcony and watch the birds and fish. -The staff at the main restaurant where they serve breakfast were wonderful. Specifically, the managers Roberto and Leslie and all of the servers. - Great adult only pools. Some beautiful infinity pools. -Truly a beautiful resort set in the jungle. Very modern with up-to-date amenities and huge washrooms. -Food at the resort was tasty. We really enjoyed the breakfast at La Laguana and we had a great dinner at the fanciest place, Las Brisas. We dined twice at El Puerto, the steak & seafood restaurant. Food was great at El Puerto but the service was spotty. -We don\u2019t have kids but it looked like they had an amazing kids program. - Most staff will address you by name which is a nice touch. -The Willow Stream Spa was fantastic. I had the Honey in the Heart treatment which was incredible and my husband had a sports massage. I was blown away by my treatment. Our manicures and pedicures were nice but overpriced. No surprise there. Overall, the spa is fabulous. Also, there is a great gym. I attended a pilates class and was the only person in the class. That was kind of fun. Cons -The hotel gave us a room with two double beds. We had requested a king size bed. They did try to find us another room in the same category but the view was not as good so we opted to keep the room with the double beds. Also, the phone and internet needed to be fixed the first night as did a light bulb. I should note that both issues were fixed quickly. -The service was inconsistent. Sometimes there was great service at the pool, other times you wouldn\u2019t see anyone until after noon. Some restaurant servers were amazing, others were okay. -The resort is so big that you essentially have to take shuttle from one end to the other. We stationed ourselves at the adults only infinity pool in the middle of the resort because it was less windy than the pool near the beach. If we wanted to go to the beach, we had to take a 5-10 minute shuttle ride. -Although Playa Del Carmen was only about 15-20 minutes away, the beach wasn't the greatest. Overall, the Fairmont Mayakoba is a truly gorgeous property. However, the inconsistent service, not-so-great weather (some rain, loads of clouds, extremely cool breeze and not high temperatures) and the distance to the beach for people who cannot afford a $2,500 oceanfront casita (apparently, that\u2019s how much is costs according to one of the employees) means that we will not return. One other note for President\u2019s Club members: There is not a private check-in for members. We had to ask for someone from the President\u2019s Club. We are Platinum members and have been for several years. That\u2019s why were astonished that they would have provided us a room with double beds when that was not what we requested and the fact that we\u2019re Platinum members really didn\u2019t make a difference. The lack of importance for Platinum President\u2019s Club members was an issue for us. At the Fairmont Pierre Marques, we are treated like royalty. Restaurant Recommendation: If you\u2019re looking for amazing local seafood, try El Oasis Mariscos just off 5th Avenue.

We stayed there for four nights after attending a work conference near Tulum. I've stayed at several placed in the Riviera Maya, and this is by far the best place I've stayed. In fact, I think I would rank this as the best hotel experience I've ever had. Our first night was in a Private Casita, which was set back from the ocean but had great ocean views from the private rooftop pool. The roof sprang a leak during the torrential rains overnight and, after some exceptionally quick and professional problem solving on the hotel's part, we were moved to an Private Oceanfront Casita. This is the one in the pictures that has the private pool looking out over the ocean. Every morning, I would make coffee and walk out to our private palapa just a few steps from the casita. The suite is very large with a full living room, a huge bedroom, and two bathrooms. The master bathroom has glass walls looking out to a private garden. Simply breathtaking. We ate at La Laguna and Las Brisas. Both were very good with excellent service. Las Brisas is expensive, but it's worth it as a splurge. We also did a \"cooking class\" with their Executive Chef. It wasn't so much a cooking class as a kitchen tour. But the Exec. Chef was great and I was impressed with the lengths that the hotel goes to to ensure sanitation and food safety. The staff is very attentive. Pretty much any wish you ask will be granted. Our private butler even offered to unpack for us, which we declined. The only thing I would caution is that this property is very large and very spread out. Getting to the beach from the main hotel complex is a 5 min. golf cart ride. But they do have bicycles all around the property, and that's a fun way to get around. If you're staying in the private area by the beach, it's the same ride to get up to the main complex where most of the restaurants are, but the oceanfront restaurant (Las Brisas) is just a short walk from the private area).

The beach itself is well-maintained and service is excellent. In fact, the service everywhere was excellent. The main pool area is beautiful and service is excellent. But, the pools were very cold..too cold to swim in. The rooms are wonderful. I highly recommend joining the President's club because they will upgrade your room if they are not at full capacity and you get free in room internet access. The rooms are spacious and clean. The bed is a bit hard (I find this with most hotels in Mexico) and my husband and I woke up several times in the night because of this. The bathroom is very spacious and modern. The food and drink are probably the biggest drawback of this resort. It is definitely not four star resort food and drink. In fact, it is closer to the quality of an average all-inclusive. Overall the food was bland and average and the drinks did not taste like they had any alcohol in them. We ended up going to Playa del Carmen the last few nights just to get some decent meals (Playa is about 15-20 minute (and 15-20 dollar cab ride, but I would highly recommend traveling there for evening shopping, drinks and dinner). We do however recommend visiting the Cafe Maya (the little convenience store at the Fairmont) and getting snacks and drinks for the room. The Cafe is also a good place for a cheap breakfast (a bagel or muffin). We agree with other reviewers that they do seem to nickel and dime you a bit. The bland food is not cheap (although admittedly not outrageously expensive for a four star resort). Also, the resort fee and the daily service charges are an unwelcome add-on. When you are calculating the nightly room rate, you really need to add on $25 or so. Overall, if the cleanliness, quality and modernity of the rooms and the natural features of the property are important to you then I highly recommend staying here.

The hotel is luxurious and beautiful, but there are just too many little kinks to justify paying more. First, as many other reviewers have mentioned, the beach is far away from most rooms. The only rooms right on the beach are expensive villas/suites. The logistic of getting to the beach isn't too bad. There was always a golf cart driven by a friendly staff member to get you around. But it was just weird---my room was 1 kilometer from the beach. I couldn't even hear the ocean at night or in the morning, which is one of my favorite things about staying at a beach resort. And the restaurant on the beach didn't open until noon. The beachfront pool area was just so-so; nowhere near as nice as the main pool area that was not on the beach. I understand the non-beach pool has to be supernice to make up for not being on the beach, but I don't understand why the beach pool has to be mediocre--it was just a straightforward infinity pool with white mesh chairs. Second, the food was just ok. Some of the room service was downright awful. Third, I saw a few bugs in the room --- nothing that bothered me much, mainly tiny spiders and silverfish, but worth noting for more squeamish people. Fourth, I was outraged that they charged $10 to use the gym. It just makes you feel like you're getting bamboozled. The good news is that the resort is beautiful. The golf cart ride to the beach is very scenic and relaxing. You're a 15-minute cab ride from Playa del Carmen proper (cheesy nightclubs, bars, etc.). The beach never got crowded so I didn't have to worry about taking that 1-kilometer golf cart ride only to not be able to find a good spot, although that may have been because of the recession.

The flight form Phila. to Cancun was on time easy and comfortable. Our transport from the airport to the Fairmont only took about 40 minutes and was also fairly simple. Cancun's newly remodled airport is small and very easy to navagate. They did a nice job. Check in at the Fairmont was great...cool towels, nice welcome cocktail and then off to our room. We stayed in a signature casita which was very spacious. Two queen size beds (very comfortable) and huge bathroom. Our room also had a private deck which overlooked the lagoon. The 4 of us were plenty comfortable..lots of room to spread out in. The resort has 3 pools. The main pool, while all connected, is sort of broken up into different sections. The slide area seemed the most crowed (but not really crowed) because it had the most kids and thus was the loudest section. Other areas seemed faily private and quite and that's were we would go for our pool side lunches. The adult only pool was a beautiful infiniety pool and was very peaceful. The beach pool (also an infinity pool) was also very nice and quite as well. The beach was awesome! Few rocks, but for the most part soft buttery sand and beautiful turquoise water. We played in that water for hours at a time. It was so warm and soothing. There seemed to be plenty of Palapas (beach umbrellas). We never had to get up early rush down to the beach to reserve one which was nice. The beach service is great and we had a few lunches down there. The resort is very expansive, so be prepared to walk a little bit. If you get tired there is always a golf cart passing by to take you to whereever it is that you want to go. I've read other reviewers who've said that they had to wait quite a while for a cart to come by, but we did not find this to be the case. There were plenty of them roaming the resort to take guest anywhere they wanted to go. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful thoughout our stay and we appreciated their kindness and warm welcoming \"holas!\" They all seemed very gracious. We ate at all three restaurants and thought the food was very good. It wasn't great dining, but very good. And yes, it is a little expensive, but we read about that before we went. We always found something we like on the menus, kids too. We also like to explore and had some really good dinners in Playa...Alux and Yatche were really good and a nice change from the resort menus. We also took a couple of day trips. Xel-Ha was amazing! We snorkeled, swam and ate from 10 am. until 5 pm..For the price of admission ($75 adult / $50 per child = tranasportation ) snorkel gear, food, drinks, towels and lockers are provided. you'll be in your bathing suit the entire day! The water is incrediblly crystal clear and warm, just about every color of fish that you can imagine and just a beautifully and tastefully designed eco park. Thank goodness Disney doesn't own it! We all loved it and I would highly recommend it. Xcaret was also beautiful. It has a really nice zoo (nice for kids) and maybe a little more in the way of cultural activities. If your still standing at the end of the day they have a really cool historical reenactment of the Mayan civilazation that takes place in this outdoor, but covered ampatheatere. Very interesting and creatitive and filled with culture and historal montages! Our kids really enjoyed it too. The resort was mostly adults and couples and I'd say about 1/5 of the guests were families with small chikdren (under 12). Our kids really enjoyed the kids program and the girls that run it do a nice job of keeping the kids interested and involved with different activities. We loved the kids program too beacuse it gave my wife and I a chance to unwind and try the spa which we did a handfull of times. We had masages, reflexology, baths, steams......it was great! A little on the expensive side, but what the heck, it's vacation! Over all we had a terrific vacation. Great family time, in a beautiful place with fun and interesting things to do, good restuarants and lots of cultural richness! This was our 5th time visiting Mexico, second in the Riveria Maya, and we've really enjoyed it! If you have any question please feel free to send an eamil. Enjoy your visit to the Fairmont Mayakoba.

We were in a signature casita which is a very nice room that overlooks the lagoon. The bed was so wonderful and the room was modern and spacious. But we were so far from the beach! The property is so large and spread out that you have to walk, ride bikes (during the day only & the bikes we tried were pretty beat up), or wait for a golf cart to drive by and pick you up. All of the dining outlets are good (not great) and definitely overpriced - which we, of course, expected. I liked that they pass out cucumbers for your eyes at the beach and check in on you often if you need anything. But, they continually mis-pronounced my last name, over and over, probably 80 times in 3 days. I know this is a 5 star standard, to say the guest\u2019s name, but it gets very annoying to continually correct them again and again on your vacation. We obviously know that this type of property is not for us but we made the most of it and relaxed at the beach each day, rode bikes, walked and tried the different restaurants. When we were leaving I asked the concierge how much a cab was to the airport which they said was $49 (I thought this was pricy because a cab all the way to Playa, which is south of Mayakoba by 20 minutes, is only $45). Regardless, I said this was fine and they arranged a nice taxi for us to take to the airport. When we arrived the driver said the fare was $60 and the Fairmont was not correct in saying it was $49. We wondered how we managed to have great experiences with many taxis all over Playa for almost two weeks and then we get the 5 star Fairmont and get ripped off.

The hotel grounds are beautiful and visitors will feel as if they are in the depth of the Mayan jungle before the hotel comes into view. The staff is very friendly and greets all visitors with juice and towels. The Front Desk is accomodating; our requested crib (with stuffed animals) and high-chair were waiting in our room. The hotel is great for kids. There are a lot of families around and the staff is very attentive to the kids' needs. As described in some of the other posts, the hotel may be better for those with kids rather than those on a romantic getaway. On the other hand, the property is so big that honeymooners (and we saw a few) would likely have fun. We had a casita near the canals and the rooms/bathrooms were large and comfortable. The water was hot, the A/C worked. Housekeeping was attentive and thorough. The restaurants are a little pricey (it is a secluded resort), but there is nice variety in the menus. The service is incredible. Everyone from the guys at the pool to the waitresses were extremely hospitable and friendly. The service alone would make us want to return. The beach (unless you are staying at one of the beachfront casitas) is a 10-15 minute walk or a 5-10 minute golf cart ride. The hotel provides bicycles to its guests and it is a very pleasant 5 minute bike ride to the beautiful beach. There is also a boat service that traverses the underground river fed canals to the beach dock. Yes, it would be nice to have a beach view, but it is an entirely different experience to stay by the canals. If you want a pure beach location, this hotel may disappoint you. The hotel is about 20 minutes by taxi (fixed price 170 pesos) to Playa del Carmen. It is nice to get away for a dinner or a day trip to the town. There was no snorkelling off the hotel beach, but the in-house travel agency could coordinate (at competitive prices) snorkel/scuba trips. The golf course is beautiful and spa was the definition of serenity, but you will pay for those luxuries. In conclusion, this is an exceptional hotel in a beautiful setting that is great for families with kids.

I've been traveling to the Yucatan for apprx. 20 years. My husband worked for a major airline and we've traveled the world. When we first traveled to Playa Del Carmen there were only 2 hotels, miles of beach to ourselves,town was a small fishing village. I've stayed at almost all of the higher end hotels in the area. My last trip was 2 years ago. This is the first time I stayed at a non-allinclusive hotel. I read all of the reviews before I going so I was prepared. First rent a car. Easy to drive. The hotel is seculded. The hotel is nice, but like everyone stated a distance from the beach. I perfer to have an ocean view. We arrived during tropical storm Doris. Some people talked about the rocky beach. Caused by storms in the area. There were some rocks the first few days then cleared up. Brought water shoes. The hotel was built in the jungle and they perserved the surrounding area ,which I appreciate. We had a Castias on the first floor that faced a lot of trees. Had an issues with spiders in the room and requested a change to the second floor, they accomodated our request. The rooms were very clean and serviced twice a day. Did not eat breakfast at the hotel. Lunch was good, a little pricey. Only ate dinner there our first night. Playa Del Carmen has turned into a crowed town with high end restaurants and bars. I prefer the quaint fishing village it used to be.Went to Puerto Morelos several times for dinner. Rustic small fishing town. I'm sure it will be the next town to change. There is a large supermarket in town ,two blocks away Walmart (larger selection of alcohol then supermarket but busy). There is a refrigerator in the room. Bought snacks,beer,wine and alcohol in town. There is a market on the property but pricey. Gas station across the street were you can buy drinks and snacks. I always bring a nylon cooler with me when I travel so I can take snacks and beverages with me to the beach or on excursions. You can view your bill daily on the TV and check out on line. The hotel charges $15 a day for the use of the golf carts,bikes and boats. $14 for valet parking if you have a car. Hotel tax think 12%. Don't golf looked like a nice course $186pp for guest.

We ate at two of the restaurants, and, as hotel restaurants go, the food was good and the prices were reasonable. As for the rooms, we stayed in one of the casitas on the lagoon. Our bathroom had a full-size glass window that overlooked a totally private garden which was an interesting touch. We also had a patio overlooking the lagoon. We would completely recommend a similar room, and, if you're willing to spring the $1000 (or whatever it costs) for one of the beach front rooms, they looked amazing. If we ever decide we need a beach vacation, we'd consider staying at the Fairmont again.

No more than four stories high, but spread out so much that from the balcony of the main lobby, the ocean is but a sliver of blue stretched across the horizon. The main building contains a number of rooms (where we stayed), and the rest are scattered across as small blocks of casitas. Golf carts and bicycles are provided for transportation in addition to a boat which runs on a waterway towards the beach. What impressed us most was the spa. We got one of the best massages ever at the Fairmont. And the spa facilities were absolutely top notch. A plethora of soaking pools across two floors, a sun deck area, a big sitting area, and everything was very well kept. We didn't see many people at the spa while we were there, so we had the whole place to ourselves. Plus the fruit juices they have are quite tasty. Pictures posted by other reviewers of the beach are accurate and it is quite a lovely beach. But the entrance to the water has some rocks that one should be aware of. The beach at Tulum is many times better, but more on that later. Otherwise, it was great to take a swim in the warm ocean waters and hang out in the pool right by the beach. I do wish Fairmont does a better job at helping its guest get situated at the ocean or pool side chairs. The staff makes almost no attempt to discern whether chairs are really empty or whether they just haven't gotten around to taking away the dirty towels. It is pretty much a help yourself situation. In this regard, you really wished you were at a Four Seasons. Once you are situated, they are good about taking food and drink orders and the I would highly recommend the kobe beef hamburger at Las Brisas - the beach side restaurant. We ate at a couple of other restaurants at the Fairmont and they were fine. The prices were actually reasonable for a four star hotel. The room itself was good and had a large bathroom with a deep soaking tub. We did have small ants in the room, but given that you're in the tropics, that's pretty much a given. The linens were excellent - with very high thread count and down pillows were provided as well. Fairmont Mayakoba is one of those resorts where you don't have to leave the hotel through out the whole vacation. But I would recommend checking out the cenotes, the Mayan ruins, and especially the beach right next to the town of Tulum (about an hour south from the hotel).

It was very hot when we were there so we stayed at the adult pool and main pool. Stunning pools. Service was very good at the pool. We were disappointed that we had pay for use of the gym ($10 a day). This resort is best for couples and older adults. Kids were around but it was not as kid friendly as other resorts. It does have a conference center and there were two conferences while we were there. Not an issue for us, the property is so big that it never felt crowded. I could see how some people would find this a problem, we did not. Mayakoba is a development, so I think there will be a few resorts that will share some facilities. It would be nice to have other resturants nearby to try. The trip to Playa del Carmen is $16 each way, so it can add up. We've been to other Fairmonts and stayed a other 4 to 5 star hotels, we think Mayakoba ranks among the best resorts we've been to.", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "L.A.", "Title": "\u201cbad experience\u201d", "Author": "herherhu", "ReviewID": "UR16044675", "Content": "My family and I were not treated politely by a gentlmen in reception when we arrived.

We traveled with 2 small children, ages 4 and 6. The rooms and physical facilities were beautiful, some of the nicest we have stayed in. They were spacious and very tastefully decorated. The Kids Center was outstanding. The hotel has a corporate focus. There were pros and cons to this. It seemed very quiet most of the time as most guests were at conference rooms and activities. This made it easy to get beach chairs, get restaurant reservations, etc., but it was also a bit odd to feel like you were one of the few people actually on vacation. I would say overall this was a positive, but it did lose the intimacy of a smaller resort. The restaurants were just okay. We never had a bad meal but never had a great meal. A small convenience store on sight was nice for light snacks and meals. Overall, prices for food were what we would expect for a resort. But drinks were extremely expensive. As a bonus, kids under 5 ate free. My biggest disappointment was that I did not know the property for the most part is situated away from the beach. To protect the environment, the hotel and major restaurants had to be built in the mangrove swamps. Canals ran through the property which were quite charming. To get to the beach and approximately 10% of rooms actually located on the beach, you had to take a golf cart or boat. While the golf carts ran frequently, this was an inconvenience. Overall, since most of the facilities were located inland, we felt like we were at a jungle resort vs. a beach resort. Had I realized this was the way the property was set up, I would perhaps not have been as disappointed about the lack of beach presence during the majority of the time. We also found service above average, but not outstanding. They made an effort, but seemed to often fall just short at times. We enjoyed day trips from the hotel to Mayan ruins at Coba and Tulum and Xcaret park. If we were to return to the area, we would seek out slightly better properties, recognizing that there is a good chance we would end up back at the Fairmont. So...pros and cons.

Our package included a $250 F&B credit but upon check-out, it was not applied and we had to fight for it. There were other guests disputing false phone charges so you really must review your bill with a fine tooth comb or you will get ripped off!!!! We were very disappointed with the physical property. First, you cannot view the ocean or beach from the main part of the property so you feel like you're in the middle of a Disney park...or in Arizona. To get to the beach requires a golf cart ride, definitely not convenient. Their were many areas of the property that were not well-maintained and were already showing wear and tear. Rooms did not feel really clean and didn't smell fresh. The food was OK, but nothing extraordinary. The wait staff was friendly and appeared to be trying so they were an upgrade over the front desk staff! During our stay, there were a couple of large groups so it appears they cater to this type of business...lots of small kids and babies too (so annoying to deal with crying babies when trying to relax at the pool).

We stayed in a casita suite (Room 802) with a private rooftop pool and butler. Mauricio was the most wonderful, intuitive and gracious assistant! You must ask for him! Every idea we had was immediately arranged by him. He seemed genuinely concerned with making our stay as perfect as possible. Nothing was beyond his ability to please. He is a true gentleman. Our rooftop pool overlooked the beachfront pool, so we had a wonderful view but lots of privacy, too. We never saw or heard any of the other guests in their rooftop pools. The other side of our casita overlooked the lagoon, so we could watch the sunset. Yes, it is a long way from the main lobby to the beach. Yes, the resort is huge and a little difficult to navigate on foot (and especially at night) but we never waited for a golf cart. When we were ready to leave we would pick up the phone and a golf cart would be at our door within in 10 minutes. We took a 10 minute, $20 taxi into Playa Del Carmen for a couple of evenings just to walk around and see the crowds. It's easy and safe. Some tips: Beachfront casitas with private pools are very luxurious, too, but had little outside privacy. There is no need to rush to the pool and \"claim\" your chairs early in the morning - there are plenty of pools and chairs. The palapas on the beach were very large and kept us comfortably in the shade. All of the staff are eager to assist you in any way they can. Don't be afraid to ask if you need something. Special mention: Nicolas who is in charge of the Front Desk is a very special person - a throwback to the days of GRAND HOTLELS and the men who managed them. He is wise beyond his years, and a very gracious host. He juggled special requests with speed, agility and a smile on his face, always. While we were there a large group had their Presidents Club meeting, but we did not feel neglected by the staff at the restaurants. Las Brisas Terrace does serve the best burger and fish sandwiches I've ever tasted. El Puerto served very elegant and delicious fresh food. We ate an a la carte breakfast at la Laguna which was also very good.

Also, the accommodation we had was perfect for us as a family. We had privacy--the master suite has doors-- and the sleeper sofa in the living room was fine for the girls (ages 10 and 6); they had ample space and their own bath and closet space. Also, the private plunge pool on the roof that this accommodation comes with was fun and decadent. The decks outside our casita were beautiful with views of the Mangroves and on the roof (in the pool) a sea view. You feel like you are in your own little house. The hotel's beach was great and the pools were really nice. The service was friendly and there was no bad attitude. Overall, the service was really good for the Caribbean or for anywhere. They couldn't bring you enough fresh towels and the beach food service, drinks, etc. was plentiful and quick. The help did not stand around always waiting for a tip and were grateful when they received one. Everyone was happy and smiling, eager to talk to you. We had a babysitter two nights named Natalia--who was outstanding. The girls asked for her the 2nd night. The kids club was pretty nice and had some good programs, although the girls only used it one morning. Although at capacity the resort did not seem crowded. No competition for chairs, etc. The food was good overall (not outstanding), but we are so spoiled in this regard by NYC restaurants. The breakfasts were excellent. Dinners at El Puerto were the best. The dinner buffets at La Laguna were just good/ok. The food was not hot enough for me (temperature-wise). Beach/pool food was very good. The only negative thing is that the resort is dead at night. They should do a cocktail party or entertainment once a week or something. We ate at Playa del Carmen one night at Negrosol, which was upscale in a Euro sort of way. Otherwise, Playa was colorful and fun but had a very young, crowded, spring-break vibe. Two highlights of our trip were the excursions. We went to Chichen Itza by private tour with a certified guide who also took us to a cenote called Ik-Ikel (I think?).

Winding private paths and bridges invite you to explore your way through the property and down to the magnificent beach. Don't feel like walking? Take a slow boat along the river, or wait no more than a couple of minutes for one of the quiet carts that are constantly running along the paths. Or grab one of the many bikes that are about the property free for your use. Transportation around the resort was easily the least stressful part of our entire stay and made the enormous property feel like it was at our fingertips. There were unexpected and wonderful surprises at every turn: Greeted by cool towels and fresh juice or wine upon arrival. The lobby is gorgeous, cozy chairs, beautiful art and flowers. We never, ever saw our maid service, but every single time we came into our room (3-4 times a day) we could see that she had been there, fresh sheets, bed turned down, fresh coffee, a postcard. On the beach, or at the pool, a staff member brought you towels, offered drinks, or delivered an umbrella before you could even think to ask. They were literally at your service without being obtrusive, or subservient. My children commented at every encounter how the people of Mexico seemed to be so happy all the time. One thing we really enjoyed at the hotel was the constant attention to music. During breakfast at La Laguna restaurant, we were treated to a small mariachi band with a truly wonderful singer. At night, over a beer at La Laguna, another duet with guitars treated us to music under the stars. Breakfast one morning at El Puerto, a harpist; Upon our return from Playa del Carmen one night, a terrific singer was performing in the lobby, so we spontaneously stopped and enjoyed a drink on the veranda. And lunch at Las Brisas, yet another duet set up playing the mexican zylophone while we dined and enjoyed the view of the Carribbean. Such a treat. The food was excellent at every one of the four eateries. We had at least one meal at each spot. Lunch at Las Brisas on the beach was amazing. French fries, chips and Guacamole, ice cold beer and soda, delivered to our beach chairs, even better! Breakfast at El Puerto was my favorite meal with a huge variety of fresh fruits, breads and Mexican inspired dishes. Also fresh salmon, cheeses, deli meats, and omelettes made-to -order. La Laguna at night offered a wonderful buffet for the children with quesadillas, hot dogs, macaroni, fresh fruit and salad, while the adults indulged in amazing seafood dishes (try the gruper!) and tenderloin prepared in authentic Mexican style. Cafe Maya was a treat for the kids: On occasion there would be be REAL Mayan tribal painted men and women outside the Cafe, great for picture ops! Inside: Ice cream, fresh fruit, a huge variety of drinks, hot and cold, chips, sweets and conveniences like sunscreen, and magazines. Poolside, order a drink or a burger at the bar, or have it delivered to your chair. Delicious. The travel office arranged for two excursions off site. Every detail was taken care of. All fees, admissions and transportations were handled by the office. The were extremely helpful with every detail including what would be age appropriate, what to wear, the weather, etc. Our tour guides were very informative and pleasant. We particularly enjoyed the trip to Tulum (about an hour). We went into town (Playa del Carmen) on two nights. Never any problem having a taxi called--Ask and in less than a minute --voila! $17 each way for approx 10 minute trip.

We ate in 2 of the restaurants and enjoyed both. I recommend the fine dining restaurant by the beach... We celebrated Valentine's day there, very romantic. The beach front part of the resort has a nice infinity pool and the beach is nice. The beach is a bit dirty to the right of the resort, much better going for a walk the other way. The resort is very pleasant as there are no high rises and lots of gardens. As far as going into town is concerned you need a taxi. It cost us 15-17USD per trip as the resort is about 8kms out of town.

It will take you 2 days just to get acclimated - it's over 550 beautifully maintained and appointed acres. Golf carts, bikes and boats are the way to get to the beach and the beachside gourmet restaurant Las Brisas(very good, not great, slightly overpriced for the quality - but very nice room with live Jazz, service impeccable). All rooms are top notch, would definitely go with asking for a lagoon view or, if you can afford, upgrade to a beach casita. Depending on when you go in Feb.(the 19th start I think), the mayakoba golf classic will be at the resort and the golfers will all have the beach and ocean side casitas and villas. Golf course is pristine although fairly easy, resort style golf. Some beautiful views of nature. When you are out and about, the place has a virtual army of staff and they are more than willing to offer help at every turn. However, calling in to request anything from the room turned out to be very sloooowww , but I think that goes with the territory. Rooms had some small ant problems but nothing to worry about. Meticulously maintained(leave a note for the roomstaff to leave extra bottled water). Willow Stream Spa will always be a wonderful memory as the services here were unsurpassed in my life of resort vacationing. From the state of art fitness room, throughout the facility(locker rooms, whirlpool hot tubs, sauna, steam rooms, swedish showers, rooftop deck and pools, hot tubs, lounges)- all was way above excellent - staff and professionally administered services are second to none.(Sampled were pedicure, relaxation massages, facials). La Laguna restaurant was adequate for Breakfast(you could have buffet 24.00pp or a la carte). Nice fruit, omellettes, waffles, quesadillas and all the regular breakfast items in quantity. Las Brisas was excellent for Oceanfront lunch(or served on the beach if you want to mix it up). El Puerto in the main hotel was also excellent for any meal and actually my fave for dinner. The beach was well maintained, long, fairly wide for this area and very swimmable. Service here, as throughout the property, was first class.Lounges, umbrellas, towels, food and drink were all served to your request. Pool areas are amazing also, with a beautiful infinity pool overlooking the beach and a vast pool area nestled between the casitas and another infinity adult pool overlooking a lagoon.

Keep in mind we are an adult couple travelling without kids. This was the first vacation we have taken without our kids in 20 years and while I would not rank the facility kid unfriendly, it is neither exceptionally kid friendly, and I would rank it kid neutral. This is clearly an upper end resort, for people with expendable cash. We stayed with conference rates in the cheap rooms attached to the main bulding of the resort, around $330/night including taxes. We were told for these rooms through the Christmas holiday, they charged and receive high 700's for these same rooms/night. We have stayed in many types of properties over the years with our kids and while I can think of one place that might have had similarly exceptional grounds, perhaps even a little nicer, the service at this facility far exceeded the other places. Even though we were in the cheaper rooms, the room and bathrooms were exceptional. Large and luxurious, clean . Keep in mind the grounds are large and if you are staying in the main resort building, it is 1 1/4 miles to the beach. They provide bicycles around the resort for you to travel with, or you can travel in boats or the ubiquitous golf carts, which are driven by resort personnel. We had no problems getting where we needed to go. If you are going with kids you will probably want to stay around the pool or at the beach. The prices for these rooms climb significantly, and I think for the beach front casitas, they were in the vicinity of $1700-1800/night. They are, however, exceptional accomodations with butlers. Personally, I would not stay here with small children. The food is good, particularly at the higher end restaurant on site, Las Brisas,. We only ate dinner at the resort two out of seven nights, and otherwise cabbed into and ate in Playa del Carmen, the other 5 evenings. Round trip cabfare with tip, about 400 pesos.

The property is huge, with the lobby located about a mile and a half from the main gate (don't even think of walking, it's a jungle with a paved road), and the beach is another mile and a half from the lobby. Only a small number of ($$$) rooms are located on the beach, with some located on the lagoon (a natural underwater river that has been tapped to flow through the resort), and some just off the garden paths. The room itself was a good size, with a big bathroom, and a flat screen TV. Beds are absolutely heavenly and the pillows were nice and soft as well. Double sinks and a soaking tub in the bathroom, along with a little garden outside of the tub are a real treat. Room service was a little sketchy, as I had to call twice in the four days for my room to be made up (it was past 1:30pm). Complimentary newspaper appeared the first day, and didn't show up again until the last day when we requested it. Food at the resort is pricey, and service does not come with a smile. The employees walking the pathways of the hotel are very friendly, always offering an \"ola\", but the hostesses and servers in the some of the restaurants were borderline rude. I would walk into a restaurant and have to work to get the attention of the hostess who was usually standing there gabbing with a co-worker. Laguna's breakfast buffet runs about $24 per person and isn't worth it. Las Brisas (restaurant on the beach) has slightly more flavorful food, and the service was better. El Puerto was open for dinner only, and never had the chance to try it. The pools are great, especially for kids (wouldn't recommend the water slide for adults as pool is only 4.5ft deep), with an adult only swimming pool located outside of Laguna restaurant that is quite peaceful, but the infinity edge overlooks the river and trees, and you start to miss the ocean. The pool near Las Brisas has the desirable infinity edge overlooking the ocean. The beach is rather small, and not always the cleanest. The water was murky up until our last day there. It is a public beach, and the Fairmont needs to do a better job in cleaning it up each morning. Keep in mind that unless you are staying ocean-front, getting to the beach is a bike ride (mountain bikes located all over the resort for your use) or a 4-5 min golf cart ride away. There is also a boat that runs on the lagoon that takes about 20 minutes to get you from the beach to near the main lobby. Overall, the Fairmont is a scenic property, but definitely not ocean front. You will feel isolated as it is a 20 minute ride from Playa del Carmen, leaving you very dependent on the over-priced, below-average restaurants.

I liked the resort and the Mexican people so much that the following is not only for fellow travelers but for Fairmont so they can further refine their excellent service and facility. Spent two nights in one casita (in the 7 block) and because of air conditioning problem, upgraded to following 5 nights in another, lagoon view, casita ( in block 1...facing a canal and across from the Event Lawn where a full out reception could be heard thru the closed glass doors but quieted down by 9 or 10 PM.. A few pluses/ a few minuses. -Outstanding, super friendly and helpful staff. Superbly professionally trained to be courteous and keep their cool no matter what the issue or how upset a guest may be, Derailed balcony shutter, light bulbs that blew out, a minor mistake on my account and a recurrent air conditioning shut off problem were responded to within minutes with follow up phone calls inquiring as to satisfaction. -With five pools (counting the two side by side toddler pools as one) there is always a lounger available. I did see a kid transiently at the \"Adults Only\" pool,,,,,I guess it's tough to enforce a rule when everyone is paying so much. The beach loungers were more comfortable than the double ones at the Adults pool and more so than the strangely uncomfortable pool side loungers. Cucumber slices for your eyes on a hot day were kinda silly but got some use ! The design of the main pool is fantastic....filled with smaller nooks and crannies so you never feel like your surrounded by a crowd of people. -The provided map and ground markings are inadequate. Night time lighting is limited. It's easy to get lost, especially after a margarita, but maybe that's part of the fun! -Excellent housekeeping twice a day with mild inconsistencies. Even when I hid the soap remnants they didn't replace them?!?!. The last night we got two sink front rugs. One room had a scale the other didn't (who cares). They never circled the weather forecast or filled in tomorrows max temperature on the nice bird watching/ identification cards they put on the beds each night. No chocolates! Maybe attracts wildlife ! -First room had 3 different lamps and the second only two...with the bedside lamp a single instead of the nice double as seen in some of these pixs! -The next to last night I learned that they do 7, 8 and 9 AM 45 minute round trip nature tours on the boat that you have to sign up for. This was NEVER advertised...anywhere. The boat to/ from the beach take different routes, the journey about 25 minutes each way and the drivers were very informative about the nature around/ ecosystem. -The bikes were fun. Think twice if you haven't been on one in years or you've had a few drinks...for your own and everyone else's safety. Maybe they should hand you a list of rules on check in since the ones fixed to the bottom of the basket (on some, not all) of the bikes is too fine print to read. Yes occasionally there are none to be found and while there's a full time mechanic about 9 - 12 bikes were out of commission each day. Always check the brakes. Rely on the rear one more as I know someone went head first coming down from a bridge for applying only the front ones ! -Mosquitos were at a minimum in Jan, perhaps more in the rainy months..come prepared and spray regularly. I did see a small dark spider in one room but, heck, I live in an old house with plenty of them. Perhaps someone else's horror story lead to regular extermination. Yes there are scorpions and monkeys and snakes and little alligators...it's the jungle and the same at all the Mayan Riviera resorts. -Restaurant prices were high end, especially for Mexico, especially with our devalued US dollar....but on a par with other high end resorts and Manhattan. Quality was very, very high as was service. Portion size at Las Brisas was on the small side and at 8 PM with a 6 year old running around snapping digital pix's and tow 5 year olds at the next table, the romantic potential and appreciation for haute cuisine were deflated despite the terrific musical trio (there was live music in almost every restaurant and lobby every night and in the lobby and beach side restaurant daytime too).......so I canned my reservation to return and indulge in the tasting menu with accompanying wines. PS the markup on bottles were 400 to 500 %. It is $16 US each way by cab to Playa del Carmen and while good, even the upscale places there were not as good as at the Resort....even the creative Mexican stuff at the Laguna rest. which was superb. Playa is just a bit honky tonk. -The prices for souvenirs at the airport were much higher than the resort and while selection was less, quality was better at the resort than at Playa. -The gym was great but $49 to use the spa facilities if you aren't having a treatment seemed really steep. While everyone raves about the spa, prices seem quite steep with 10% tax and 15% service charge to be applied. Overall I can't remember returning from a resort so relaxed and pleased.

We spent most of the first week camped out on lounges by the pool near the beach but then moved to the adult only infinity pool in the middle of the resort as more and more family showed up with small children. The adult only pool was a quiet paridise away from the noise of the children. When we arrived on Dec 18th, the resort was very quiet, but as Christmas came the small children also arrived. The nice thing is that there is always a place to go to find quiet as the resort is so enormous. We rented a car for the entire time from National, which gave us freedom to come and go as we pleased. The restaurants at the resort are great and the food suberb, although eating at 3 places for 15 days gets a bit boring so we ventured into Playa at least every second night. Our favourite restaurants in Playa are Da Vino and the Glass Bar. Located directly across from one another and both owned by the same person. Both are Italian gourmet. We also enjoyed our days at Xcaret and Xel-Ha. My suggestion would be to do Xcaret if you only have time for one as it is more culturally specific and the nightly two hour show is spectacular.

We would have left to go to the Ritz Carlton in Cancun had we been able to without forfeiting about $450 in tours we had already scheduled. If you are looking for a place to sit at the pool or beach and do only that -- sit (and drink or read), you could probably do much better elsewhere. There is a beautiful golf course if you want to play in 90 degree heat and 90% humidity with the bugs and mosquitoes, or utilize the spa. However, my girlfriend ruled out the spa after the repeatedly poor service we experienced. We had issues from the moment we arrived. The service was so bad in every department, that at times we wondered if we were on a hidden camera show. When we asked for things, we either got something different than we asked for, or nothing at all. For example, I ordered four beers (for the reasonable sum of $30) from room service that I chilled over ice and stored in our room's refrigerator. I went to enjoy one later the next day, and they were warm. I called the front desk to see if they could send a maintanence attendant to check the machine and was told that it was a \"beverage center\" and not designed to keep drinks cold. What, then, was it designed to do? It certainly looked like a refrigerator. After reading about the \"standard refrigerator\" in each room in the in-room resort guide, I asked a room service waiter the next night if the machine in the room was indeed a refrigerator. My question was met with a quizzical look, as though I asked him if the canvass and rubber things on his feet were shoes. I said that it wasn't keeping my drinks cold -- he, of course, responded by saying, \"uh, maybe it's broken.\" Duh! However, after asking him to send a maintanence person to the room, my refrigerator / beverage center remained, uh, broken. This may seem nit picky (not to me), but imagine every time you ask for something, from requesting one foam pillow one night and having all of your feather pillows replaced with foam pillows for the rest of your stay, or asking to be picked up from your room and having no one show up, or being completely ignored as you sit at the bar as the bartender breaks down the liquor bottles with five tables seated 40 minutes before the bar is actually supposed to close, it gets really old after a while. This is not what you expect from a five star resort, and we were fed up after a few days. Frankly, if we were staying at Fast Eddie's Roadside Motel, I would have overlooked the dead dried bugs on the white bedspread, the bathroom thermostat that didn't work, or the broken sliding doors that I almost cut my foot on trying to get them to close properly. But this is supposed to be a five star resort -- so I did notice these things, and when they are not isolated to one or two things, it becomes quite irritating. The food and menus at El Puerto and Las Brisas (the property's signature restaurant) are totally substandard if you enjoy eating (great) food. I was amazed at the complete lack of local ingredients and the limited local fish available on the menus. Who wants to eat duck, rack of lamb, Cornish hen or risotto in 90 degree heat? Further, the food quality was so bad that we actually cancelled our main courses at Las Brisas and went back to the room to order room service. This was after sending back three drinks in a row: a signature martini that was served room temperature and smelled truly like vomit, a special margarita that was made with brown sugar, lime juice and tequila (imagine honey and tequila, not a tasty combination) and a dirty Grey Goose martini that was green and murky because it was all olive juice with a splash of vodka. At least they didn't screw up the beer -- although it took three times of me asking to actually get limes for my Pacifico. I actually got a call from the resort's executive chef the next morning who asked me to detail the problems at the restaurants we experienced, and he assured me that this was in the process of being fixed. (Apparently, the chef at Las Brisas left two weeks prior, presumably because the menu and fare is so poorly designed, unappealing and does not compliment or match the surroundings). To my surprise, he agreed that the menus were not up to the standard that their \"main competitor, the Ritz Carlton up the road\" are. Guess that was my problem? Overall, we had a very expensive vacation, and feel like we paid handsomely for a miserable and frustrating experience. We have stayed at the Kea Lani and had a totally different experience with Fairmont resorts. However, this resort does not measure up. In fact, I'll close with a comment the general manager made on our last night after I was so completely fed up that the front desk patched me through to his cell phone. After I recounted a few experiences with the hotel when I felt the service level was below expectations (we had a list of over 30 problems over 6 days), he responded by saying, \"Sir, you made the choice to come to Mexico. What did you expect?\". That pretty much sums up our experience. Apparently, one should not expect much. In fact, if you expect nothing, there's even a chance this resort may exceed you expectations! Don't go, unless you don't mind bad food, atrocious service, and a swamp marketed as a fabulous Mayan jungle.

This hotel is about 35-40 minutes from the airport in Cancun, which is a little annoying, but when you get there you will feel instantly relaxed. We were greeted with a welcome drink and a cool scented cloth. Our check-in was very quick and we were escorted to our room by the bellman. The property: The property itself is quite large and you have several options for getting around. The first is walking, which we did most of the time. We were about a 5 minute walk from the lobby and breakfast place (La Laguna). The walk to the beach was a little longer, so most times we grabbed bikes or took a ride on the golf carts. There was never an occasion where we were unable to get from one place to the next. Golf carts were everywhere and there were always bikes at the beach. There were water taxis as well, but they ran every half an hour and we never wanted to wait, but they seemed nice. The Rooms: We had one of the Casita rooms overlooking the jungle and it was beautiful. It had a huge bathroom, two sinks, huge tub and separate shower. There was a huge terrace which had seating and was pretty secluded. The only thing I disliked was the fact that there was no screen to go out to the terrace, so we were unable to leave the doors open to the room and get fresh air. Restaurants: We tried all three places. LaLaguna was more of a breakfast place, although they had some nice lunches. I wouldn't go there for dinner. They offered a buffet, but we always ordered a la cart. Try the banana smoothie...it's awesome. The other restaurant (I can't remember the name) overlooked the beach and was the BEST one. They had a great live jazz band and the setting was completely romantic. Although they had no chicken on this menu, the steak was fabulous. The third restaurant was El Puerto which was in the main building. This restaurant was mostly seafood, and was very nice except that my husband and I both got sick from the food. He had the surf and turf and I had the chicken. At the pools they also have food which they will bring to you, which is more like quesadillas, nachos, etc. The Pools: There are three pool areas. The main one is right next to LaLaguna and is beautiful. There are plenty of umbrellas or shady areas. The other one (which we did not go to) was toward the lobby and was rather small. The bellman told us that since they do not serve drinks there, it is almost always empty. The last pool area is right by the beach with an inifinity pool. This I had heard was an adults only pool, but I am not sure. Beach: Beach was very nice. Tons of umbrellas and people to set up towels and chairs for you. Having been to Cancun, this beach is slightly more cloudy and has a few rocks and vegetation as you walk in. It is not as pristine and clear as the beach in Cancun. It was slightly more wavy as well. There were no water sports except for a guy walking around asking about jetskiing. However, it didn't seem like you could really go anywhere with the jetski, so we didn't bother. Service: EVERYONE at this hotel is friendly, kind, and helpful. We even had a guy who was on his way to stock a vending machine offer to take our bags to the lobby. CLEARLY this was not his job, but did so with a smile. The staff was happy to smile at my spanglish and help me to practice. The Spa: One word-OUSTANDING. Immaculate, relaxing, and one of the best spas I have ever been to. My husband and I go to spas wherever we go, and we both agreed that this was the best. I had the scrub with ylang ylang and massage and my husband had the hot stone massage. Playa Del Carmen: TWO WORDS-BE CAREFUL...my husband was robbed at knifepoint after getting money from an ATM in the shopping area. We are both native New Yorkers and typically consider ourselves street smart. I suggest you carry a small amount of cash when going to that area and no important documents. Overall: One small thing that bothered me throughout the trip was the presence of tiny ants everywhere. At the pool, in the room, and it was generally annoying.

We were upgraded from a main hotel room to a casita, which had a beautiful bathroom, two queen beds, flatscreen television and excellent air conditioning.

The main pool is broken into several different pools, including an \"adults only\" infiniti pool over-looking part of the lagoon. The main pool is walking distance from the main lodge and the various casitas. The beach is approximately a mile from the main lodge. There are regular golf cart rides and boats through the canals. The easiest and quickest are the bikes, which are stationed all over the resort and, honestly, the best way to get out there. We really liked that. The beach is beautiful, has a great pool overlooking the ocean and plenty of covered chairs looking out towards the gulf. The water is warm and the bottom sandy and smooth. We had an excellent experience here and would definitely return. The negative comments about the distance among the various places on the grounds seem exaggerated to me. The negative comments about the service are also exaggerated. The service was not without flaws, but it was hardly problematic. There was ample opportunity for drinks and food throughout the resort and at virtually any time you wished for it.

Except for one, they are all a long ways from the beach and breeze. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Large rooms that were well serviced. Spa got high marks from our guests, particularly the massages. Now the bad stuff. If you see all the canals in the photos, don't be fooled. The hotel is in the middle of a mangrove swamp and with that you get a lot of bugs. Be prepared. It is very spread out. To get to the beach, you need to take a golf cart or ride a bike. Fun to do in the morning, not so much in the afternoon. Check your bike before you take off. We had a guest that had no brakes and crashed on his first day there. The beach is great, but there is nothing to do. No jet skis, no boats, no floats, no parasail..........nada. If you want to go to a beach and do nothing, this is the place for you. Worst lobby bar in the world. It looks like a lobby but it's also the bar. However, it has no bar and everyone is scattered all over the room. Every night there is live music with a guy playing to an empty room. I've stayed in a hundred hotels and this is the worst bar ever. Rooms have motion detector thermostats. When you go to sleep and stop moving, the AC cuts out. You wake up sweating and when you move, it starts cooling. We couldn't find an override. Last negative.........the refrigerators in the rooms take 8-12 hours to cool a beverage to drinking temperature. When you go to the store on the grounds, all the beverages they sell are hot, even though they are presented in a refrigerated case. So if you want a cold beverage, you have to go to the bar and pay double. Overall, if you want to sit by a pool or on the beach to read a book, nap, and you don't really care what it costs, this is the place for you. More than a couple of days and you will go nuts because, unless there is a large corporate group there, it is virtually deserted.", "Date": "June 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice\u201d", "Author": "freqtrav88", "ReviewID": "UR7925392", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for three nights during mid-May. This was the largest of three properties we stayed at during our vacation. Yes, I agree that this is a very large property but I tended to see the good in the size. You are easily able to hop on a bike, cart, or even a small boat to get around. We never had a problem accessing transportation. Let's face it, walking is not such a bad thing either. Our room (in one of the casitas) was very pretty, clean, minimal, with the highlight being the bathroom (gorgeous shower and large bathtub). The various pools were immaculate (another reason the large property is a bonus - many pools to select from). Yes, the restuarants were a bit overpriced, but what hotel restuarants are not? I loved the spa and my husband enjoyed the golf course. The spa ammenities are terrific - know that there is a separate pool on the roof. I took a toning class in the gym and the trainer was very helpful. Unfortunately, I do agree on the service - it was certainly lacking to say the least. Not once did anyone offer to help us with towels at the pools and nor walk around and ask if you might be interested in lunch or a drink. It is pretty much a DIY hotel on that end. Also, the service in the restuarants (we went to all except the lobby restaurant) was the same - very slow and inattentive. We expected a better quality of service from a Fairmont property. I do think that once the surrounding resorts open (Mandarin Oriental, Viceroy, Rosewood), they will be forced to step up the service or they will lose clientele. We didn't experience any of the security issues but because we read tripadvsor reviews prior to our trip, we were extremely careful. We also did not see a tarantula - thank goodness! I was very scared by that previous review but think those guests had a fluke experience. I do believe the rates are fair as we did visit during the low season.

The employees who ran the kids-club/baby sitting service were very good. Room ... very spacious, even with 2 queen beds and a rollaway bed. We were in the 500 section which is half way between the lobby and beach and near the main pool/La Laguna Grill/Cafe Maya. We used the golf cart transportation to both the lobby and beach each day and rarely waited more than 5 minutes for a ride. We didn't experience any thefts.

We always double-checked the sliding glass doors to make sure they were locked. Restaurants ... we ate dinner at El Puerto and received very good service. We ate breakfast at La Laguna Grill several mornings. They serve both al a carte and buffet breakfasts. Some days the service was quicker than others. We ate the buffet breakfast at Las Brisas and weren't impressed with the offerings or price. Food and drink service at the main pool were good, but slower on the beach. Cafe Maya offered light breakfast/lunch and drinks/snacks.

Check in was efficient, and as Fairmont President's Club members we were upgraded to a suite as well as offered complementary entrance to the spa and 2 for 1 rounds of golf. Walking around the property takes a while since it is so spread out. They do offer trolley service around the property as well as water shuttles to select places and one can use the hotel's bikes to get around, although the walkways are not super wide and can to treacherous to negotiate. The rooms are very new, modern, and clean. Our suite had a living room with patio overlooking the waterway and a distant ocean view, the bedroom had a king bed with additional seating, and there were two full bathrooms in our room. The spa is really spectacular with separate men's and women's sauna, outdoor whirlpool, and steam rooms. The lobby restaurant was pricey and good, but since the food in Playa is so good in general, we felt it was much better to eat in town.

There are several pools--one at the beach and the main one in the middle of the property, which is really a series of smaller pools linked together. Plenty of chairs and towels at both locations.

I should preface my review by stating that we got a very good deal through Expedia for the rooms so I didn't feel we were paying through the nose for a five star hotel. I may have judged it differently had we paid full price. To begin with, transportation from Cancun airport went very smoothly. We arrived at the hotel and checked in without any problems. We were assigned a staff member to assist us to our room and orient us around the hotel. Our room was in the main block nearest the lobby area (cheapest room rate). It was beautiful. As you enter the room there is a small foyer area, a full walk-in closest with a safe, king size bed, nice size balcony with a bench, two chairs and a table - - we had a beautiful view of the swimming pool, gardens, and lagoons. The bathroom is phenomenal - - double sinks, soaking tub, frameless glass shower and a seperate toilet area. The air conditioning and fan were in perfect working order. There is a fridge for use in the credenza. We ate at every restaurant in the hotel. We had dinner the first night at El Puerto which is located in the main lobby. The service was wonderful and the food was good - - however, I didn't feel like there was a very diverse selection. Dinner ran us about $160 USD (no drinks). La Laguna grill, which is located in the middle of the resort, walking distance from our building, was where we had breakfast most mornings. Buffet is about $25 USD per person. If you order ala carte it is still around $15-20. Dinner was very good, had a little more flair in terms of choice compared to El Puerto. Las Brisas is located down at the beach and serves lunch and drinks all day outside and dinner in the evenings. The restaurant at night is beautiful, very elegant, the live music they had was first rate. However, I think the menu was restricted and the dish I ordered was just \"ok\". Again, Los Angeles prices. However, the atmosphere is very romantic. The all day food menu for the beach/pool side is great. Burgers, salads, club sandwiches, spring rolls, etc. Prices average about $20 per item. I found the service on the beach and by the pool to be fantastic, efficient. I noticed other reviewers indicated very poor, slow service, this wasn't my exeperience. Finally, the El Lobby Lounge - - we had drinks and appetizers here and it was a beautiful experience. We sipped our drinks and ate as we overlooked lagoons and watched the sunset. Appetizers are well priced at $5 each (small) and the selection is very good. Drinks however run about $12-$15 each. For incidentals there is a cafe/store near La Laguna - - this sells books, magazines, sunscreens, drinks, cookies, muffins, sandwiches, chips, cigarettes, coffee, etc. There is also a store downstairs in the main building (next to El Puerto) which sells typical hotel gifts and clothes (expensive, weird clothes and jewelry). However, they also sell books and cigarettes and a few other incidentals. The grounds of this hotel are just beautiful. The bathroom in the lobby is stunning. There are three pools on the property. The first near the lobby and the block we stayed in is lovely. However, when you see the pool in the middle of the grounds it pales in comparison. This pool is huge and stunning. It has a kids area, an adult only area and a swim-up bar. The pool is massive and has little nooks and areas where you set up for the day and just relax in a chair. The third pool, located by the beach is wonderful. The view at the end of the pool overlooking the beach is paradise. The beach itself is SPECTACULAR. The sand is bright white and feels like velvet. The water is incredible shades of turquoise, greens, and blues. The salt content must have been very high as we were quite buoyant. Although it is quite spread out, walking from the main building to the middle (La Laguna and main pool) is only a five minute walk. However, from there to the beach it's probably about another 15 minute walk - - one we never did. Golf carts are abundant and always stop to offer rides, are also available immediately from designated points - - we never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a ride. Drivers are safe and very friendly. We had two outside excursion tours, one to Chichen Itza and the other to Xcaret. The drive to Chicken Itza from the Mayakoba was about three hours each way. We went by tour bus and it was relatively painless. We took a taxi to Xcaret which is only about 15 minutes down the road. They charged us $25 USD each way. We spent an afternoon in Playa del Carmen, the cab was $15 USD each way. Only about 10-15 minutes down the road. We ate at a terrible restaurant and walked along looking at the shops - - most of them selling the same wares. Each time it was a pleasure to return to the hotel. The hotel was definitely not full to capacity, however, it did not feel like a ghost town, it felt intimate and romantic. On the second to last day of our trip a conference of about 400 people arrived. Although there were notably more people around, it didn't really impact services or space in a negative way. The service in the restaurants, housekeeping, and in general was wonderful. The staff are friendly and helpful. We never had any problems with theft (as per other reviewers).

On the positive side: - the weather was beautiful - the beach and pools were well-maintained and never crowded (since everyone there also seemed to be there for a conference) - the conference center had enough capacity to cater to our large crowd - the property was easily accessible fom the airport and was just 15mins outside Playa del Carmen - the staff thought of little details such as bringing bug spay for guests to use at night events On the negative side: - the property was massive - it was a 15 min walk to the beach from most rooms - very poor signage...I got lost several times wandering through the property trying to find my room as signs were often either lacking or ambiguous.

Apologies in advance for the length, but I wanted to touch on as much as I could.... About us: we are in our early 30s and both are professionals. We were looking for a great beach, quiet relaxation, golf, and great service. Arrival: Upon arrival, we immediately were greeted by staff with cold towels and water and escorted into the gorgeous open-air lobby, while staff tended to our luggage. One staff member took care of us exclusively after check in, showing us around and then taking us to our casita by golf cart, while explaining the property. Our luggage arrived by separate golf cart a short 5 minutes later. T The Rooms: we stayed in a private signature casita (the 800 series of casitas), which was at the beach (but not directly on the beach \u2013 they are the row of casitas directly behind the beach front suites if you look at the property map). Our room was beautifully appointed with a deck overlooking the lagoon. The room was immaculate, amenities including robes and slippers were replaced each day, and turndown service was excellent each evening. Additionally, whenever we had a request from housekeeping, the staff responded promptly. We kept iPods, money, passports, wallets locked in the room safe and didn\u2019t have any problems. The beach casitas are perfectly located if you want to be near the beach, the beach infinity pool and the bar at Las Brisas. While they are set apart (significantly) from the lobby and the main pool area, we enjoyed the privacy and never had a problem getting to and fro when needed. There are bikes aplenty throughout the property, which we rode often. It\u2019s a five minute ride from the beach to the main pool (and adult infinity pool) and the restaurant La Laguna and Caf\u00e9 Maya. It is a few minutes longer to the main lobby and spa. Also, if you are not inclined to bike, there is always a golf cart to take you wherever you are going. You also can arrange golf cart service in advance if you need to be somewhere at specific time. We had to be in the lobby one morning by 6:45 for our Alltournative zip-line tour (HIGHLY recommended, by the way), and we called the night before to have a cart pick us up at 6:30 with no problems. My husband did the same for his tee time at El Cameleon \u2013 he was taken to the lobby and then driven to the club house. The beach: We spent most of our time at the beach and the beach pool, as it was so close to our casita. The beach is gorgeous (albeit windy in the afternoon) and was never overly crowded while we were there. There are ample umbrellas and palapas if you want to stay out of the sun. We found the beach service to be impeccable; there always was a staff member to bring us down to the beach with towels, set up our chairs and umbrellas, and send over a waiter for food and drink service. Likewise, the food and drink service was excellent and timely. There is quite a bit of beach for the staff to cover, so we understood that there might be a wait for our drinks, although we never remarked that it was taking too long. Our experience with the staff on the beach was top notch \u2013 they were solicitous and friendly - helpful with anything we needed. We felt the same at the beach pool, where we spent almost each late afternoon. The staff even got us an ice bucket for our coronas that we had brought from the room. The adult infinity pool is great if you want quiet, and the chairs have fabulous cushions so you can hang out, sleep, or enjoy the view of the lagoon for hours. There is a great lunch menu offered poolside, as well as fresh fruit and cold towels. Service was excellent. The main pool is beautiful with so many different areas that you almost never run into other guests. There are also cabana-type tents you can sit under (and umbrellas) to avoid too much sun. The restaurants: La Laguna: We ate four meals here; one dinner, one dinner at the bar, one buffet breakfast and one breakfast off the menu. For each, the service again was efficient and friendly and the food was very good (and VERY reasonably priced \u2013 I actually was shocked at how good and diverse the menu was for the price). Las Brisas \u2013 the restaurant: We had one dinner in the Las Brisas dining room, which was excellent. It is the resort\u2019s more elegant restaurant, and no beach attire, shorts, open-toed shoes (men) are allowed. The service was french-style; very attentive but unobtrusive. The menu is relatively small but the food (diver scallops, grouper, Cornish game hen) was excellent, the wine selection was good, and dessert was amazing. Our only complaint was that the live music (a small jazz band with a piano player) was a bit too loud at our original table, but the hostess promptly gave us a new table and it was fine. While the Las Brisas dining room is the most expensive restaurant at the resort, it was no more expensive than a comparable restaurant here in Boston. Las Brisas \u2013 Outside bar and restaurant: We ate several times at the bar/terrace outside at Las Brisas and found the service attentive and efficient and the bartenders fantastic. The food (pulled pork with jicama slaw, burgers and truffle fries, ahi tuna fresh rolls, chips and guacamole) was great and we never waited more than 10 minutes. Prices were very reasonable - ahi rolls were about $8 and the pulled pork sandwich was about $15 - nothing out of the ordinary for a resort. Caf\u00e9 Maya: We visited the Caf\u00e9 several times for Gatorade, water, turkey sandwiches (which were great), chips, etc. It\u2019s perfect for a quick \u201cto go\u201d bite and for drinks to bring to the pool or beach. We didn\u2019t eat at El Puerto, but it looked nice. We loved the lobby bar, which has great service, drinks and tapas. We also used room service twice and it was fine. Because of our location at the beach, it did take about 40 minutes. Willow Stream Spa: Our massages were great. The locker rooms are exquisite, with steam and sauna rooms and a whirlpool. There\u2019s a \u201crelaxation room\u201d on the second floor of the spa, where you can hang out before or after your services, and they offer muffins, freshly squeezed juices, and coffee and teas. The spa also has two mineral pools that are only for the use of spa guests. They are on the second floor \u2013 on the roof, essentially. This was a great place to spend a few hours unwinding, as it was virtually deserted. Gym: Could be larger, given the size of the resort, but it was fine for the 2-3 times I used it. Access is complimentary if you are a Fairmont President\u2019s Club member. Golf: The course is gorgeous but it has A LOT of water, so bring extra balls. The only complaint is that there is a fair amount of construction going on (the other resorts are going up in the Mayakoba complex) and my husband said it was somewhat distracting on some of the holes. Checkout was smooth \u2013 we were picked up at our casita and our luggage arrived in the lobby separately (and promptly). Other Observations: 1.It appears that a fair amount of reviewers of this property visited for conferences, sales rewards trips or for other work-related reasons. We noticed that there were three such groups staying at the Fairmont while we were there. If you are considering this property for a vacation that is in no way work-related, I would avoid relying on those types of reviews because a business traveler\u2019s needs and concerns generally diverge from a vacationing family, couple, etc. Our observations were that the few people we heard complaining were at the resort as part of a conference or company event of some kind and their complaints followed suit [ie. rooms too far from conference areas, organized events/dinners not as nice as they\u2019d hoped, expensive and spotty WiFi access]. I think expectations (and mind set) may be different based on your reason for being at the resort. 2.We went into Playa del Carmen twice (once to Wal-Mart to get bottled water, cheese & crackers, and Coronas for the room) and once to dinner at Yaxche (which was amazing!). We had planned to eat in PDC more often, because of the reviews we had read re: the high prices & lack of quality of the food at the resort, but that simply wasn\u2019t our experience, and we found that once the evening rolled around, we didn\u2019t feel like leaving. Also, we didn\u2019t love what little we saw of PDC (Yaxche notwithstanding). Ultimately, we had the greatest vacation and will return as soon as possible (even though I am tempted to try the Mandarin Oriental when it opens in the fall!). We were so well-taken care of by the staff that I think better service would be hard to find. I do think you need to know going in that it\u2019s a quiet place - and it\u2019s not a typical \u201cocean resort\u201d where everything is on the beach (and if that is what you are looking for, go elsewhere). But if you want a beautiful, natural environment and \u201cquiet time,\u201d we thought it was perfect.", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cFirst Class Operation!

I've read some of the other reviews about waiting 30 minutes for a golf cart (why would you do that when it doesn't take more than 15 minutes to walk anywhere) to pick you up and have to say we did not experience that. The carts ran constantly We actually walked most of the time both to the beach and to the lobby/convention center area. The resort also has mountain bikes available at all tram stops which can be used for free to get around and a boat system. The staff are very polite and eager to be of service. The grounds are beautiful. We loved the infinity edge pool by the ocean. The gym at the spa has high end workout equipment and was usually almost empty when I went. Only downsides were about half of the people in our party came down with the stomach flu although I'm sure it happened off the resort. The food was just OK.

Specifically, the poolside watistaff and bartenders were unattentive and unusually slow even when you finally were acknowleged. Lunch took 2.5 hours one day, finally arriving after 2 or 3 reminders. No one would actually come around the pool to wait on guests regularly. You were forced to either walk to the bar for drinks or ask the bartender to send someone out to wait on you. When you did finally get some attention, the staff seemed annoyed or put out that you had requests. Disappointing. Housekeeping, which is touted to be twice daily, sometimes showed up for their one-time visit around 5pm, as we were just coming in from the pool or beach. I spent a couple days sitting outside while they finished up the room. Once I stepped inside, linens/towels were not consistently replaced and never were any toiletry items replaced.

Another thing we did not like was that the mini-bar at the room was empty and had to be filled, and paid for in advance, if you wanted to have something to drink in your room, so it was similar to room service. I had to plan what I would like to drink in my room for the next five days and pay for it !

I have to admit that we were somewhat worried after having read some of the reviews posted by visitors who were at the property late last year and over the holiday season, but it would seem to me that the management team and staff have successfully solved most, if not all, of the problems that were mentioned. We found the food quality to be good to excellent, although the portions were very large by our standards. Yes, the prices are somewhat of a premium, but it is a top quality resort. The gardens and the lagoons are tended to fantastically. When you think about the work that goes into keeping such a large property up it is truly amazing. The property is stunning and well tended to - and the beach is tremendous. Althought the hotel was full, or close to it, we never had to worry about chairs or towels. Walks with our children around the resort were very enjoyable - and transportation was easily at hand if required. Note: many people wait around for transportation...yet the walks are not as long as they might appear and are very enjoyalbe. From the reception to the beach it is about 15 minutes, maybe 20 if you have kids or take it very slowly.

Imagine how thrilled we were to find most of our fears ungrounded! The grounds and the rooms are beautiful. The spa and the fitness facility were also quite nice. We have stayed in many resorts for corporate events and this would rank up among the top. (Last year we were at the Fairmont Acapulco Princess and everyone in our group agreed this was like night and day). We stayed in the 500 building of rooms on an upper floor, corner unit. We never experienced any problems with cart noises and guests going over the bridge. They must have replaced all the gas carts. The only noise issue was at 5 a.m. when they were pushing the carts ful of tableware and food over to the Isla lawn. Of course it was for our own group's morning event, but way too much rattling very early in the morning. Maybe they can put rubber mats on the carts to cut down on the noise. We thought the rooms were nicely appointed. In tropical places you really don't want a lot of rugs and heavy furniture. I would agree though, that a chaise lounge on each deck would be nice. Of course for your own relaxing, but also for more seating if you have guests come to your room. We were on the deck a lot and never had a problem with bugs. They definitely need more hangers in each closet. Bring cd's as they have a nice bose player in each room. The fridge really only keeps things cool, not cold - but our bellman told us that upfront and pointed out where the ice was if we wanted to get more. Quite a few of us did experience the \"key issue\" of not being able to get back in our rooms at various times and it usually took more time and hassle than was acceptable. At one point an employee happened by while I was waiting and let me into our room. While I was grateful, I was concerned that they never bothered to verify that I belonged to that room. As for the walk to the beach - the complainers must be major couch potatoes! At a leisurely pace it wasn't more than 10 minutes from the lobby and there was always a cart going by offering a ride. As we were there for a conference, all our food was buffet at our own event. But I will say none of us were happy with the food. No flavor and basically all the same texture. The only difference in taste was if it was hot or cold. There was no flavor to the salsa, guacamole, shrimp sauce - things you expect to have a \"kick\". A few people did take in lunch at the beach bar and that got better reviews for taste, but 2 hours for a lunch was the norm. Speaking of the beach, we thought it was fine - people need to keep in mind the amount of damage that was done by the hurricane if they're expecting \"pristine\" conditions.

Expected to be inconvenienced by the PGA golf tournament but it was a non-issue. The property is visually exquisite and nicely arranged. Others have said it's spread out and the beach is far from the main area, as if that's a negative! We chose this hotel because it's spread out. Yes you can take a golf cart, but we chose to walk everywhere. I used a bike once (they are all over the place, just grab one and go) but they are not in the best condition and hard to adjust for one's height. We loved the walks to and from the beach. Stayed in a deluxe casita (room # in the 300 range) and it was perfectly located near the main pool and breakfast location, as well as close to the spa. Our room was large and comfortable. The bathroom was extremely large with a tub overlooking a jungle scene (see photos). Bring your own essential oil and you will feel like you are in a spa! We had massages (just ok) which included use of the very relaxing hot pool upstairs (on an outside deck). They gave us free juice drinks (pineapple with chaya was the best one). Having a massage also gave us use of the steam room and aromatherapy room, lockers and showers. If you aren't having a service, then it costs $45 USD extra to use the facilities. The gym is $15 USD to use the equipment. Join the Fairmont President's Club, then it's free (and so is internet in the room). The beach has very nice sand. Try to get cushioned chairs, much more comfortable. We did not have to get there at 6am to mark our spot; could arrive at 11 or even 12 and get chairs, even during a school vacation week. The staff is friendly but it does take awhile to get your food order. Breakfast was a terrific deal - 190 pesos for cold buffet or 240 for hot buffet. I suggest choosing the buffet because it takes forever to get things if they are ordered from the kitchen. Buffet food was often replenished and the food quality was excellent. The choices were the same each morning but there was plenty to choose from. We had huge breakfasts, little snacks for lunch, then drove into Playa almost every night for dinner. Parking was not easy; we used one of two lots ($1 US per hour) located on Avenue 10 around Calle 2 and Calle 4, then walked down Fifth Avenue. We never once saw any free parking on the street. The concierge was pretty helpful in getting reservations, which i did through email about a month before our trip. We liked John Gray's Place (service was terrible but food was excellent), Negrosal (expensive but sophisticated), and Yaxche. I had read that the property is dark at night and to bring a flashlight; we never needed it. Housekeeping was 2x a day and thorough. The only thing to remember is to securely close your door; it won't fully close by itself unless you do it manually.....sometimes we found it open upon our return, but it was our own fault. This is not the best place to bring teenagers unless they have friends with them or really need to just rest by the beach or pool. There is not a lot of activity at either location. Our teens had homework to do and were happy to lounge most of the days when we stayed at the property. We took two field trips while there, which broke things up.

The property is beautiful and we definitely enjoyed ourselves. There are basically 2 sections of the hotel. The larger grouping of rooms are close to the lobby/spa/convention center and pools. The smaller grouping (about 40 or so rooms) are located near the beach. Some of these have plunge pools and roof top decks that overlook the ocean (like Las Ventanas). The few rooms that are on the beach directly overlook the hotel guests with beach chairs so, these are not as private. The ones on the back side with the rooftop pools or lower untils overlooking the river offer the most privacy. (These rooms are numbered 800 to 900.) The rooms are nice but missing some decorative detail as well as some of those touches one might see at a Four Seasons or other fine hotel such as fresh flowers in the room, dependable turn down service that includes a small token gift and/or a small welcome gi ft upon arrival, -chaise lounges on ones private deck instead of just chairs... My husband and I booked a room located at the beach area. We were close to the Las Brisas restaurant and there is an infinity pool overlooking the beach area as well. The wait staff helps with towels, drinks and one can eat lunch at the restaurant or the beach. I was told that they will be building 'Palapas' for shade on the beach instead of just umbrellas. Unlike some previous reviewers I thought the beach area was pretty. My husband and I took long walks in either direction and one can get a sense of the area and the other 3 resorts that will be part of Mayakoba ( The Banyan Tree, Viceroy and Rosewood). We were told by the staff that they will all be connected via the canals with boats already in use by the Fairmont. I would have been nice to receive some information in our room on the activities available to the guests. ie cooking classes, exersize classes and featured entertainment in the bars and restaurants. We did receive a Miami Herald delivered to our room daily which was nice. The Golf Course- El Camaleon surrounds entire property. My husband thought it was challenging and in 'great shape' -although it would have to be as the PGA tour is there this week. **Golf in the afternoon is available at a reduced rate and no one is on the course. As previous reviewers have suggested the food is nothing out of the ordinary. The taco buffet at La Laguna was very tasty. The restaurants in Playa Del Carmen that we tried were all very good though. Tips/Suggestions: 1. Rent a car - it is easy to get around. Playa is 20 min away and is based on a grid system- its easy to park most fimes for free and find shopping and restaurants. The main shopping street is 5th Avenue with the typical Mexican fare. If you have a car you can visit the ruins, Cozamel, Cancun etc... at your leisure. There is a travel agency in the Fairmont that can help with excursions. 2. Book a room near the beach (#'s800-900)- If you do in the AM get a golf cart back to the breakfast buffet at La Laguna, after breakfast stop at the nearby deli and purchase a sandwich, get a bike (usually outside the pool area or at the lobby) go back to the beach, store sandwiches and drinks in your in-room fridge and when the time is right- enjoy lunch on your private deck. The sandwiches are good quality and a better value than the food served at the beach. (The beach is 3/4 mile from the pool area /La Laguna so walking is possible but, takes longer. ) 3. If located at the beach - Call for a golf cart 10 min before you are ready to leave your oom. Call for your car ahead of time as well. Critiques: We did have some issues-- We were locked out of our room the first 3 nights after dinner. ( Since we were so far from the lobby it took some time for assistance). As it happens there were some issues with our door lock which eventually were resolved. Our room 'butler' never materialized, my husband did get sick from the food at one of the restaurants at the resort, the screen door in our room was broken, and light was out on the veranda, concierge forgot to confirm dinner reservations. So, on the 5th night of our stay we did complain to a manager and he did give us one night free lodging and the next day a butler delivered a formal apology with flowers and fruit. That did make us feel better about our stay. Unfortunatley, on the way home I realized that my brand new Ipod was missing from my bag. This was disturbing as I did not take it out of the room during my stay. However, I did not lock it in the safe while we were there and probably should have. (We have since made the hotel aware of the situation) All in all , The Fairmont property is attractive and the service was generally friendly and reliable. I feel that the price of the room (Private Signature Casita) catagory we stayed in though was not as good a value as some other hotels in the same catagory.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel and grounds- but it has its drawbacks\u201d", "Author": "Katieorange", "ReviewID": "UR6814103", "Content": "My stay at the Mayakoba was pretty good.

It is as about un-Mexican as it gets. I love a luxury hotel but the Fairmont has created something devoid of warmth and charm and quite frankly, at $700 a night (cough), I expect more of an \"experience\". Alas, it was not to be. I traveled with my elderly mother who wanted a little r&r. She and I both love Mexico but after two nights in Tulum at a fancy eco hotel, I couldn't wait to get out of our Mayakobean nightmare. We left after one night. Yes they have Bose radios. Yes the bathrooms are handsome. Yes the staff is friendly (if somewhat over-coached). And yes the welcome iced tea and cool towel are a hopeful beginning. 5 Reasons I won't return: #1. Poorly planned. The idea of a waterway lagoon system seems cool but the reality is the \"casitas\" are front loaded geographically so that if you decide you want to wander over to the beach and have a drink to watch the sun sink into the horizon, you have to wait for a golf cart to pick you up. You may be waiting a while. FYI: Walking would be freakish at this place. #2. Over-priced. People who stay here are either conventioneers or particularly rich. And golfers. The course is nice so if you want to tee off every day disregard this rant. #3. Las Brisas Restaurant. The atmosphere was devoid of what Mexico does best: warmth. Too much posturing going on without much behind it. The menu wasn't very creative at those prices and since the restaurant is ON the beach, why not open a window or two? The dishes are too safe and the portions too much - wasteful. #4. The \"casita\". It's a hotel room rivaling that of any Motel 6's proportions, long & narrow. The balcony is a plus but between mosquitoes and noisy golf carts whizzing by - we happened to be placed right on the end by a bridge so whenever a cart with a load of people rode by, we'd hear a \"weeeeeeeee!\" and lots of laughing - I'd stay inside. The internet wasn't working and the decor is sort of depressing. All in all, just not very cozy. Don't be fooled by those glowing photos of a gorgeous room! Disregard if you're staying in an oceanfront suite. #5. The guests. The place is filled with business travelers and their spouses. These people are happy to be out of akron in february for good reason. Getting drunk at the hotel pool bar is par for the course here among this resort wear crowd. They just happen to be paying more for their drinks. Ultimately, don't pay this kind of money for the Mayakoba. It's a complete money suck. If you want to pay lots of money for great service, golf and beach time, manicured surroundings, and fancy digs, consider Barbados or St. Bart's.", "Date": "February 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington State", "Title": "\u201cNo worries\u201d", "Author": "DBS1950", "ReviewID": "UR6753286", "Content": "We booked our stay at the Fairmont Mayakoba through a travel agent. Subsequently, after reading a number of negative reviews on Trip Advisor (which I did not learn of until after we booked our reservations), I became concerned as to what we had gotten ourselves into. Fortunately my concerns were unwarranted. The Fairmont Mayakoba was wonderful. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was of high quality (one note, the air conditioning condenser line to a number of units broke during our stay. We were offered the opportunity to move to another room, but as we were told it would be fixed within a day elected to stay. Unfortunately the air conditioning was not fixed within the time frame promised and we spent a couple of uncomfortable nights in our room). Other reviews indicated the concierge desk was never staffed. In our experience there was always someone at the desk , although it was impossible to contact them by phone as the line was always busy. But a quick walk to the lobby always resulted in their prompt attention to our problems and Monica and Ana were very helpful. The Mayakoba is spread out in a maze life fashion, but it is easy to get around and not too diffficult to learn the landmarks. The walk from the main lobby out to the beach is no longer than 10 to 15 minutes. Golf carts are always available to transport you to your destination. Another note, some reviews were critical of the gas powered golf carts because of the noise they generate. In our experience most of the golf carts are electric and very quiet, although there are some gas carts remaining. Now for the bad news. All of the reviews which were critical of the restaurants are accurate. The prices are extremely high and unjusifiably so given the quality of the food and the lack of choices. We ate in La Laguna and at the restaurant at the beach and both experiences left a lot to be desired. We chose not to eat at the restaurant in the main lobby as the menu was very limited and not appealing to us. Our first meal was a buffet dinner at La Laguna. The offerings were prime rib and what amounted to chicken tenders for the meat dish. There were some desserts, tacos, salads, etc. The price for two people was $100 and again, given the quality of the food and lack of choices, was outrageously overpriced. Dinner at the beach was also expensive and the menu options were very limited. My criticism is of the menu and prices. The wait staffs were very competent and concerned that we enjoy our experience. If I had to guess I would say the Fairmont is aware of the issues in their restaurants as at virtually every meal four or five restaurant employees, including managers, would stop by our table to see if we were enjoying our experience. Unfortunately good service cannot make up for overpriced meals which lack flavor. Breakfast at La Laguna is a reasonable option with a $25 dollar buffet that offers good food and some variety. We did not discover the snack menu by the pool until our last day, but would suggest that this menu is more reasonably priced and offers greater variety. We ate most of our meals in Playa Del Carmen a 15 minute cab ride ($15) away. i would recommend the Madre Tierra on 5th Ave. We also enjoyed visiting Xcaret and Xel-Ha. Both trips were arranged by the Mayakoba's travel desk, I would recommend you speak with Inez as she was very helpful. One note, each of those tours really requires a full day to see and enjoy them , so leave yourself enought time. Also, if you make a resevation for the dolphin swim at Xel-Ha make sure which program you are signing up for. Not all dolphin swims are the same, they offer some different experiences and options and we were a bit disappointed that we ended up with an option that was not as optimal for us as some others we learned of after the fact.

I too read all the reviews (good and bad) posted here. Hope our experience helps you all! Resort: Beautiful grounds, pretty flowers and plants everywhere. Meandering walkways. I was a little concerned about the expansiveness of the resort as I'm almost 5 months pregnant -- walking is good for me but only if I feel like it :). Our room was halfway between the lobby (6 minutes max) and the beach (about 8-9 minutes) and that's not walking fast. This is the most we've walked to get to pools/restaurants/lobby but you get used to it and it's actually quite nice, in my opinion. Also, there are golf carts zipping by constantly or you can just phone from your room to get someone to come by. Because everything is spread out, it's very peaceful and quiet. If you want to be bumping into people all the time, perhaps you should be at an all-inclusive that have all their pools/restos/etc...grouped together. If we could change one thing, it would be to have the main pool area and the beach area closer together -- we felt like we had to choose one over the other because of the distance. Beach: It was very skinny but still great sand. I think I saw about 50 nice chairs (get the teak-like ones with the pads - phenomenal). Was windy the day we went so we didn't go into the water. was very relaxing though and the staff was accommodating. the other days, we went to the main pool for a couple hours at a time (was closer) Main Pool: Very classy with little twists and turns which created privacy spots for 2 to 4 people. Staff would come around with a little fruit kebab or a eucalyptus eye wrap (both gratis). Kiddie pool is near the front entrance to the pool area and the adults area is closer to the back. Cabanas (probably between 5 to 8) were used mainly by couples with small kids but first come first serve, like everything else. The chairs are OK - faux woven rattan - would be better if they had pads. Plenty of towels everytime I walked by the towel cabana. Best thing was the numerous platforms in the pool where you could sit in a few inches of water and tan, read, etc... Room: We had a deluxe casita on the ground level. Very pleased with our room (looks like the photos on the hotel site) but the bathrooms with the natural light were even better than the bedroom. I'm not a bath person but took 4 baths with their Penhaligon \"quercas\" bath products (even hubby liked the bath products and he's a Dove guy). Shower can fit two and has a bench. Separate toilet. Has two closets and 1 safe that worked fine. Would recommend more hooks to hang up swimsuits, etc...Also, would get a second level room just to use the patio. Since ours was ground floor, we didn't go out because we have tall plants (privacy) all around. No issue with bugs. Always had plenty of bottled water left by staff for brushing teeth although we still bought our own. Food: Only had breakfast, couple lunches, and one dinner at the resort. We had a car so preferred to head into Playa Del Carmen. Sure the prices are not cheap ($24USD for full breakfast buffet) but it's comparable to any luxury resort. Lunches were about 17 USD per person. Dinner at La Laguna was ok priced as well - quality was OK there but we were tired and didn't want to head into town. Someone was raving about their guacomole by the pool - in my humble opinion, it was just OK, needed more salt and some lime to kick it up. Overall, we're happy we rented a car as we left the resort at least once a day. Valet is 14USD/day. Golf: Hubby and I played golf - a lot of golf. Total of 11 rounds. It's a very nice course. If you're a guest, it'll cost you around 159 USD + tax to play before 1:30pm. If you play after (twilight), it's about 105USD all in. Carts are included. We played so much that they let us pay twilight rates for our last round at 10am one morning. Staff at the golf course were really nice people. Always smiling, always willing to help out. Service: Always pleasant, always warm, the staff at the Fairmont does a great job in making you feel welcome. Does it have the polish and efficiency of a Four Seasons? No. But they make up for it with their friendliness. Case in point: We were going for a 2nd trip to the breakfast buffet and had to wait a couple minutes for made-to-order eggs. When we walked back to our table (literally 15 ft away), we realized that the staff had assumed that we had already left and they then cleared our table and reset it. It was quite funny and when we pointed out what had happened, we all started laughing. It was no big deal (they even put my husband's sunglasses away) but they still apologized profusely. I know this is a lot of info but I find it helps to be specific about certain details, especially those that are important to me! We really enjoyed our holiday although we normally meet more people at the resort. If you are seeking a more social/interactive trip, you may want to rethink.

We went with a fairly large group for my husband's business, but also had a lot of alone and free time. Normally, the reviews are a good indication of how a place is going to be for me, but not this time. First of all, the entire place is amazingly beautiful. The grounds are in the middle of magnificent foliage, trees, and all types of plants. It is almost like a jungle feel, but much more manicured. The resort is spread out, but that adds to its attractiveness, and it really isn't terribly far to get to any one place. The people who are complaining about how long it takes to walk everywhere must be extremely slow walkers. We walked to the beach several times from the other end of the resort, although we didn't need to because golf carts came by every few minutes asking us if we needed a ride. It probably took us 20 - 25 minutes (max) to walk from our room (close to the lobby side) to the beach side. We chose to walk almost everywhere because we were admiring the beauty of it all. We did take the golf cart back from the beach to our room, though, because by the time we were done with the beach side we were tired and there was always a golf cart available, ready to take us back. We also had the option of riding bikes if we wanted to. We ate at most of the restaurants and had room service ordered in. The food was always delicious. The people on the phone told us exactly when to expect the food to be delivered (about 45 - 50 minutes from the time we ordered. Not horrible, especially considering that we knew when it was going to arrive). Our dining experiences at the restaurants were always great. The servers were more than friendly (even walking me to the bathroom when asking where it was) and accomodated any special requests we may have had regarding the food. The breakfast buffet and the lobster & scallop fajitas at Las Brisas were my favorite! Service is not the fastest, but we were there to relax and take it easy, so we didn't care at all. Most Carribean restaurants are that way. There are several pools to choose from, and they are all beautiful. One even has a water slide. If you get thirsty or hungry there are always wait staff available, ready to serve you if you don't feel like moving. The entire atmosphere is designed to be extrememly relaxing. If looking for more action, the lively town of Playa Del Carmen is not far at all. The front desk can arrange a cab in no time. We went there to shop one day and for the nightlife one evening, and had a great experience both times. We were treated like royalty at the Fairmont. I didn't even open my own door half the time because if a staff member saw me coming he/she would rush to open the door first. It was very clear that they would bend over backwards for us if needed or requested. Everyone was always all smiles, extremely courteous, and more than competent.

What I got was a FOUR POINTS by Sheraton stay. If that. First of all, this is no boutique resort. It is a big, sprawling CONVENTION hotel. It's a mile from the lobby to the small stretch of not very appealing beach. It's a jungle hotel with a little beach... it is NOT a beach front hotel. The beach, however, is no prize. Small, not terribly clean stretch of sand. Never went into the ocean once. Having gotten used to luxurious, trouble-free stays at hotels like the Four Seasons (which, at the price you pay, you should get), this place was nothing but PROBLEMS. All of them were eventually resolved, but only after TREMENDOUS effort on my part. I felt like I was at work trouble-shooting all day. NOT RELAXING. Not at all. Let's start with the airport pick-up. It DIDN\"T happen. Even though I had confirmed it twice with the hotel's concierge. So I had to call the hotel on my cell in the heat while I was being hounded by dozens of drivers at the airport. NOT a luxurious experience. No excuse for it. The room category I reserved (on-line) turned out to be totally different at the hotel. Got an upgrade, but only after the first room I was shown was flooded and I had waited an hour for my bags to arrive from the distant lobby. The room I ended up getting was quite nice, but NOT air-conditioned. The A/C never worked properly even after calling maintenance. I had to keep the thermostat at 63 degrees to get it to work. Which meant the room was FREEZING. But better than suffocating. And, if you turned off the A/C, the room starts smelling like the swamp the hotel is situated in. The food was not good. And really expensive. I ended up using room service most of the time. The wait was always 45 minutes, mostly because the distances the staff have to travel are SO LONG. The big pool complex shown in the photos is beautiful. But it's half a mile from the beach in a swamp. Exceedingly hot and humid. No breeze at all. You are always overheated at this hotel, even in the cool part of the year. And they DO gouge you for bottled water. It's really tacky. You're always taking the smelly, diesel-smelling golf carts everywhere. (There are a few bikes, but never where you want them). So you have to wait for the carts in the heat. (And if you want to go to the gift shop or the deli or the beach or the lobby, you have to factor in about 40 minutes for the trip. At least). They actually have \"bus stops\" for the carts. Also, beware of the rooms along the \"busway,\" because you will be hearing the noisy carts and smelling them night and day. Kind of odd for an eco-resort. If you take the boat trip from the lobby to the beach, you quickly see that the hotel was built very cheaply. Big chunks of marble are missing from the buildings and the wood has already lost its stain. The whole place looks like it was thrown up in a hurry. My favorite part of the visit? Getting TRAPPED up on the roof of my casita for an hour at 9 pm because the turndown service locked me out of my room. I was literally trapped 3 stories up. Fortunately, I had the room's cordless phone with me (only because of another problem... the staff had turned off the heat to my private plunge pool... which took 1-1/2 hours to correct). After calling the front desk 4 times in one hour, I finally demanded to speak to the manager. 10 minutes later, I was freed. Having spent most of my time either experiencing problems or trying to work them out, I did get to know a lot of the staff. They were, with only one or two exceptions, very nice people. But that doesn't make this a hotel worth visiting. Their parting gift? After check out, I was overbilled $200. I didn't even bother contacting them. I no longer have ANY fight left in me. Ultimately, my hotel stay was really just dreadful. I will NEVER stay at another Fairmont. One final tip. This \"Riviera Maya\" area is really not worth visiting unless you see the Mayan ruins, which actually made up for the unpleasant hotel stay. And, beyond just the Fairmont, all the new, genuine luxury hotels they are building (including the Rosewood & Mandarin) are on small slivers of land that stretch from the highway to the beach (about a mile and a half in most locations), with most rooms sitting in the flat, hot jungle.

When we returned to our room we found that the key to our adjacent room was not delivered as promised, and we had to wait an additional 45 minutes, after several phone calls to the front desk. Each time during our stay when we would call to the front desk or concierge, we were placed on hold, or transferred to voicemail, and our calls would go unreturned, or in one case, returned at 1015pm!!! Housekeeping did a fairly good job, although we had a light bulb out in our bathroom and the light switch on the bedside lamp literally burned out (and burned my fingers when I tried to turn it off!). Upon our departure, I had to leave notes for housekeeping on the various fixtures that needed attention. Also worth noting is that the pools were repeatedly out of towels (even at 11am). Ultimately, the food at the restaurants was so mediocre and expensive, and the service so slow that we ended up taking taxis (US$60 r/t for our family of six) into Playa del Carmen for most of our meals. By the way, restaurants worth checking out in Playa include: la Cueva del Chango, Tango Taco and El Diablito. We spoke with other guests who felt the same way about the food and service \u2013 a real disappointment when you\u2019re paying top prices (US$799 per room per night). This resort is too big, its layout cumbersome and tiring to navigate, and the service is slow or non-existent. My entire family could not wait to leave and get back home, and that\u2019s a very sad thing to say about a very expensive family vacation.", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLow Occupancy; Still Lots of Problems\u201d", "Author": "Ricardita", "ReviewID": "UR6611633", "Content": "My family and I stayed for 3 nights mid-December when the hotel was 25% full.

A typical example is the fact that bottled water is given to each room,but the restaurants charge 3.50 for the same bottle.So---- if you want to take your pills in the morning carry your free water to the restaurant.What angers me the most,are the trip advisor reviewers who receive substantial upgrades and write raving reviews about this hotel.I challenge those reviewers to pay the real prices for those rooms,when the hotel is more than 50% full and give the same praise as before.For those who are looking for boats in a canal system that hardly ever run,rainforest shower heads in each room,and some pretty foliage,by all means go to this fairmont. However,if you are looking for great rooms,great service,and fine dining,don't you dare think about this Fairmont.In Feb the PGA is having an event at the El Cameleon golf course.Managers from every Fairmont will probably be coming to Mayakoba.Youll probably hear all great things about the resort on the Golf Channel.Dont believe it.Once the outside world leaves,the same general manager and staff will remain and until that changes this hotel will still be a less than average resort", "Date": "January 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DC", "Title": "\u201cMixed bag\u201d", "Author": "XSverdad", "ReviewID": "UR6605776", "Content": "My wife and I were there from 1/2 - 1/9.

Similarly, my wife ordered a burger at the beach-side restaurant and the patty looked very similar to a pre-fabbed McDonalds patty, only larger. However, the texture and flavor were worse than the ones you get at Micky-D's! Keep in mind that the cost of this stuff is truely astronomical. These two meals were substandard at any price, however. The other meals we had ranged from \"very good to OK\". None of it was spectacular and none of it justified the price. Also, of particular note was the sea/beach. The sea water at the beach had brown suds and occasional trash in it! The neighboring beach had trash/garbage dumped and/or washed-up on it - some of it neatly bagged and some of it not!

When we decided to get room service, we could not get any one to answer, and repeatedly got transferred to the front desk, whose response was try again in 15 minutes!

The grounds were beautiful, and the staff were all friendly, but clearly they were not well trained or managed. We returned one night after the turn down service, to find that all the dirty towels were still on the bathroom floor. We came back another night, and noted that they left only one bath towel. The room was clean and roomy, but there were many little things that needed fixing, such as the air conditioning, the balcony doors, the safe. The food was decent, but never great, and clearly overpriced. Luckily, we had a rental car, that allowed us to go to far better restaurants at nearby Playa Del Carmen.

No problem...we went to the Walmart in Playa and bought everything we needed for the week, booze included for a little over 100 USD. The restaurants vary...some fabulous dishes, some not so hot. Any glitches in service have to do with not enough waiters working full houses. Never anyone at the concierge desk. Golf cart transportation throughout the resort excellent and fast. Summary...an amazing spot,,,not up to Fairmont standards for service and dining. Quite expensive. Remember 10 % surcharge for IVF (?) plus 2% accomodation charge PLUS a service charge added on top of the top dollar room rates. If you've got a pile of money and a lot of patience the place is amazing. If not, go to town to eat Recommend Casa D'Agua and Yaxche...both terrific.

I briefly read reviews and didn't pay too much attention and I never contributed one before, but I am compelled to write one after spending a week there. The ocean is 5 minutes golf cart ride from hotel's main complex , it could have been built just off the beautiful ocean. The path is too long for a casual walk to the beach and often it maybe too hot to walk in the sunny daytime and the walkway is not particulary scenic. There are three restaurants in the hotel and a small one in nearby golf course, to which you have to ride a cart also. None was impressive as 4 or 5 star hotel restaurants, food was mediocre quality at best compared to the price. There are plenty of empty seats always but quite often you have to wait for something instead of seated right away. Beach side restaurant was using the same tablecloth for the next customers. I wanted good Mexican food experience but it was mostly below average American food. I once asked the waiter to order the same dish as the person next table was having while I pointed with the finger, I was served totally different food. (Too bad, but it is hard to blame them because it would be impossible to learn without good traing and experience.) The staffs tried to be friendly, but they are under trained. After I checked in, one staff member accompanied me all the way (I am not sure why she did) to my Deluxe Casita room with Jungle view(actually the view was limited to the path only) but she had to ask other staff members three times on the way to find my room. Only at the end, she told me it was her first day at the job. She showed me that the room has a full bath, a glass shower door and two robes and so on as if guests have to be told. The refrigerator was not working and it took a day to get working one. I didn't report that the scale was not working and it was never repaired until we left, but the housekeeping staffs were doing their best. I want to hear PGA tour players' response. The food, the location and the course. I don't know how they will serve food as I believe they are incapable to handle the volume. The golf course had only one hole with true oceanview. The course, in my opinion, was too plain boringly flat with almost negligible hazards even for a worse- than-bogey player. Yes, the place is isolated from the crowd and quiet but maybe too much so. And at night, you may have nothing to do unless you go out to nearby town. If you are planning a visit, read the reviews.

The resort is breathtaking, and very big and it takes some time to get from one place to another.

They have golf carts that will pick you up outside of your room or if you just stand on the path. To get to the beach, we had to wait a while for a cart that wasn't already full. When we got to the beach, there wasn't a chair to be had (at 9:30am). BUT, the beach staff carried chairs down to the beach to accomodate us. The resort was clearly overwhelmed this holiday week and the staff was doing the absolute best they could. *Get to the beach early to get a chair, towels, and cushions or befriend a beach staffer and give him a tip to set you up early in the am. Room service took a very long time two days in a row, so plan accordingly. *The Deli on the property (where everyone tells you to go for everything) is good for gourmet coffee drinks and suntan lotion and that's about it. We went out in Playa del Carmen most nights for dinner and took a cab. *I would recommend John Gray's Place, La Casa De Aqua, and The Glass Bar as they all had outstanding food and service. *If you go to Tulum to see the ruins and don't want to take a bus tour, rent a car and get there by 8:30am and you won't have to stand in line and wait. One day we got there at 11am and the line was over 2 hours long and you cannot pre-order tix unless you're with a bus tour. *If you rent a car from the company that's at the resort, the guy usually doesn't show up (if he does show up) until 9-10am so plan accordingly. We were there over New Year's Eve and the show was amazing and very memorable. They had 4+ Mexican/Cuban bands that were out of this world. *We paid a preminum and were told that no children would be at this event. We also had to buy our own bottle of premium liquor (Grey Goose and Captain Morgan) if we wanted to drink it at the evening event.

I think next time when we go back, it won't be during a peak time and we'll give them a little while to get settled and trained and wait until the other resorts at Mayakoba are open so you can take the boats over to each one and have more dining options on the property. *Our car to the airport was 50 minutes late (b/c noone showed up for work after New Year's Eve), luckily we planned appropriately and made it to the airport in plenty of time. *We left 2 hours before our flight and were just fine.", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fairmont Mayakoba", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d574376-Reviews-Fairmont_Mayakoba-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$187 - $445*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carretera Federal Cancun</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "574376", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4b/23/90/fairmont-mayakoba.jpg"}}
