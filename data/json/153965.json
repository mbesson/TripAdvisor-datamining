With hesitation I booked this hotel as it was quoted as 3 \u00bd stars and with recent events in Mexico. A week prior to our arrival, I emailed Erika Padilla (agerenciaoap@mx.occidentalhotels.com) with a request for a king size room, as close to the pool as possible on the ground floor. She responded immediately and said that she would do her best to accommodate us. Arrived at Cancun airport, very organized, quickly got our luggage and then proceeded to go to our bus transferred. We were immediately spoken to by a man whom we thought was with Air Transat bus, only to realize he was trying to sell his sightseeing tours. So be aware of anyone approaching you inside the airport because they are trying to sell you tours or timeshares. The actual bus ride from the airport took over 1 hour as we had to drop off other people at other hotels but we didn\u2019t mind because we were busy trying to see the sights around us. The bus driver was fantastic, he was quite funny so it really got us in the \u201cMexican\u201d mood with his quickie Spanish lesson. Location: Building 54. We arrived at the hotel around 1pm, quick check-in, but we had to wait for our room as it was not ready until 3pm which was fine because it gave us time to check out the hotel, have lunch. I was immediately surprised at how beautiful everything was from the lobby, to the grounds which were immaculate to the pools and the gorgeous ocean view. Absolutely breathtaking! I like to be at the pool in my lounge chair, sipping my drink rather than on the beach but I we walked every day along the miles and miles of beach, beautiful. The resort is a 5 min. cab ride (70 pesos) into Playa Del Carmen, a beautiful picturesque quaint town. 5th Avenue is where it\u2019s at, from night clubs to pubs, to restaurants, it has it all the nightlife you want. Very safe to be in. The hotel had cabs lined up outside, but they got to know our names and as soon as we walked outside the front entrance of the hotel, they were ready with the cabs. Room: We went into our room and it was beautiful, king size bed, bottom floor, across the relaxing pool! Who could ask for more, with an added bonus of a bottle of champagne from Erika. She went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect, one night, we found a plate of fruit, one night we found chocolate covered strawberries! I cannot thank her enough. She is the sweetest, cutest women, so warm and friendly! Thank you Erika for making our trip filled with wonderful memories. Thank you to Yvonne as well. All the 5800 rooms are all close to the pool/ocean area. Food: Fabulous. The Italian restaurant was great! I\u2019m Italian and the marinara sauce was fantastic! The Mexican was very good as well. The buffets at lunch were great, pizza was good although sometimes I think they could have cooked it a bit more, I like my pizza crispy but it was still very good. The dinner buffets were always different, the breakfasts were fantastic! A lot of variety with their menus. STAFF: One word: wonderful friendly staff! I want to thank Neri for his terrific cappuccinos. I still miss my 11am cappuccino. He was always very friendly and courteous, very nice man! Erika, goes without saying how wonderful she was. I can\u2019t remember everyone at the front desk but they always had a smile and a thank you or how are you today! Allegro should be honoured to have these hard working, talented people working there. ENTERTAINMENT: All the staff were good. Not much entertainment at night. We went to the disco one night, but it was small. We didn\u2019t mind it, we usually went to Playa Del Carmen on 5th Avenue every night, Erika had given us names of places to go, they were wonderful little \u201cMexican\u201d places with live music and that is what we like. Overall, our experience in Mexico was wonderful, weather was hot, hot, hot. If you want a great, clean, friendly hotel with good food and amazing staff, Allegro Occidental Playacar is the place to go. This hotel deserves at the very least a 4 star rating. We will definitely be coming back.

We stayed in a top floor room - wich is much more spacious and \"authentic mexican\" than the ground floor rooms because of the palm leaf roof. And we did not have any problems with insects or birds getting in or any other problems with the rooms - as many others have described in their reviews. If you want to go early to bed some nights, try to get a room as far away from the show stage as possible - they make a lof noise during the show wich starts at 21 h. By the way, do NOT expect professional actors at the show - but if you combine it with a good bottle of wine or some drinks it can actually be funny to observe! The outdoor area at the hotel is really nice! The buffet food is okay but again do not expect to much. The Italian Restaurant is really good - try the carpacio as starter! Trips we can recommend: Day trip to Maroma beach. Coba, Mayan Village and Cave trip (one trip) - you can book it at the hotel, with the guy in the corner with the blue shirt.

Just came back from our 2 weeks holiday getaway and had a great time. As time share owners we had an ocean-view room upstairs on building 45, it was close to the pool and the beach. Our friends that traveled from Argentina stayed in building 54, both had a balcony with hammocks. Allegro is a small resort (we like small resorts only) very well located in the exclusive neighborhood of Playacar amongst incredible hotels and houses definitely worth visiting. It is only a few minutes from town and only a 70 pesos cab ride. The resort is very simple, the lobby is very welcoming with great couches and tables but no bar, the grounds are beautifully maintained, there is 2 pools, we used the one by the bar with a perfect view of the amazing beach. The bathrooms by the pools need TLC and the stalls are really small. The Mexican restaurant and the lunch buffet are very conveniently located by the pools. No need to worry about dressing up for lunch here! The food in general was good, the menu changed everyday so there was a good variety to satisfy everyone's taste. We loved the \"Chef's choice\" night and the breakfast station were you can get eggs made to your taste, I recommend the omelets, they were excellent.The ambiance at the Italian restaurant is pleasant but definitely needs improvement, the menu is very, very small and the foods are better at the buffet, however, the waiters are very curtious. The staff, particularly, the morning and lunch staff at the buffet were fabulous!!!! they treated us fantastic, always had a smile or a joke, we looked forward to seeing them every day, definitely they made this holiday a memorable one. Our hats go off to Luis, Jacobo, Alfredo and Humberto for their cheerfulness, unbelievable talent and friendship during our stay, we miss you! Ditto for Fernanda for keeping the boys in line Ha,Ha! (she is very blessed to have such great guys in her team), also Neri for his expertise at the espresso bar and our lovely maid Lucy for her kindness and attention to detail. Thank you for a job well done, Allegro should be proud of these outstanding staff members!!!!! We will remember you always!!!!!!!!!! As far as the nightly shows don't expect much, in the past we never missed one, there was a variety of talent, but now they are really not worth going to unless you want to be on stage for some kind of a silly game. The exception is the Mexican show. We know you are capable of better Allegro, we've seen it in the past! Visit the \"Tulum\" ruins if you can, it is beautiful (aprox. $40) and \"X-caret\" an eco- friendly park were you can swim with dolphins, see the turtles hatchery, the zoo, the aquarium, swim in the underground cenotes have lunch at one of the restaurants by the beach and much more. This park will take your breath away (aprox. $140). Overall all four of us enjoyed our vacation and we will be back, hopefully by then some of the little kinks will be fixed and the extraordinary waiters are still there then!!", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201csimply lovely\u201d", "Author": "Annie2786", "ReviewID": "UR125730876", "Content": "we just got back from a 4 day stay at allegro playacar and we did not want to leave! we had such a wonderful time and this hotel definitely made leaving tough. we had read some mixed reviews before coming but i can't imagine what people have to complain about! we arrived 5 hours before check-in, but this was no problem - we were able to store our bags in a locked storage room until our rooms were available. we were welcomed with a delicious cocktail and went right to the pool. the pool and the view are amazing. there are 2 pools, one is the relaxation pool and the other is the activity pool where we always sat (this pool has the direct ocean view). once we checked in to our rooms, we were very impressed! the rooms are very simple and slightly outdated, but not in a bad way - they were very nice! we had a second floor room so we very much enjoyed our balcony with a hammock. the resort grounds are very charming with the different huts. the staff were all very nice and helpful! the food was VERY good, the lunch buffet was near the pool which we very much enjoyed. breakfast and dinner were also very good - we loved the buffet. no one in our party (4 people) got sick from the food, drinks or water - major plus! the drinks were pretty good, the mojitos are very good. some of the drinks were pre-made so they were a little too sugary but there were plenty of other options. we were treated very well at this resort and would definitely come back again. the activities team was great and kept everyone involved! Adan (the leader of the activities team) was absolutely hilarious - he does a great job and so does the rest of the team. only negatives (and these are minor): sometimes the music near the activity pool was a little too loud, a lot of people walking around trying to sell you things and the birds are very loud in the morning and it is often hard to sleep past 7AM without earplugs! but who wants to sleep in when you are somewhere so beautiful? people would feed the birds near the pool which resulted in a large number of birds, but this is no fault of the resort. overall: if you want a great vacation at a great resort in a great location - you should stay at this resort. the beach location and proximity to town make it a perfect option. the charming grounds, fabulous pools and great food make this a perfect getaway!", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA piece of paradise\u201d", "Author": "MyPhilosophy", "ReviewID": "UR125644202", "Content": "This hotel is very simple, so I do warren you if you aren't looking for the minimal basics, then I suggest you look else where before making the lives of staff members miserable with an over abundance of complaints.

I am so bad with names, but the guy that works the beach bar until close, is absolutely wonderful. He will for sure take care of you. The grounds were kept absolutely pristine, and the beach, WOW. Simply beautiful. The nice thing about this resort is, since it is a smaller resort the beach doesn't fill really early. One thing that I did not read in reviews was that there is no lobby bar. I have been away several times, and this is the first I have ever experienced that. For me, it was a bit of a problem, as I do like to meet people at the lobby. Otherwise, great vacation.

These employees go over and above, friendly, helpful, cheery and warm wonderful servers. Anibal room attendant, another great employee. The breakfasts are great...lots of good mexican fare to choose from, eggs many, many different ways and sometimes fresh donuts as well. My fiance really likes the bacon, my favourite was salsa, eggs, gaucamole & refried beans. Lunch by the pool was always good too...lots of choices, plus fresh fajitas, pasta and always grilling up chicken, salmon, chicken & regular burgers. The pizza was good, thin crust, lots of different toppings and fresh. Dinner was okay, nothing really over the top except for the \"Chef's Regional Night\"; whole chickens, oven roasted turkey, lamb, pork, salmon, seafood mix, ribs, roast beef. Very good. The Mexican was very good as well but for meat choices would have to be the \"Chef's Regional\" We booked into the Italian al la carte-fantastic; nice setup in the middle of the room with different types of appetizers, plus what you could pick off of the menu. A few suggestions, resort should offer specialty coffees, such as cappucinos, espressos, Spanish in the al la carte without EXTRA COST. (their is the 'gourmet coffee' hut just beside the pizza booth, but for the speciality coffees you need to pay extra. House wine, red-tasted more like vinegar, as though the grapes never really matured on the vine and processed anyway. When the resort didn't have the regular house wine but were offering the Frontera from Chile way, way better. This same wine can be purchased in Ontario (i have tried it), way better choice and HAS BODY!!!! The resort only offers Corona as the beer of choice, we picked up some of the brand we prefer, better tasting. The mini bars are stocked only with water, where again being use to a larger resort where these places put in beer, pop and sometimes small snacks. if you arrive late, after 10:00pm there is no food available and only the disco is open for drinks. But since 2008 which was the last maya trip for my fiance & I, the resorts have all done an AMAZING job reclaiming the beach area. There is plenty of beautiful sandy beach, loads of chairs and you are not feeling too close to the next group of sun worshipers. The resort keeps you busy if you want to be with many activities, night parties and fun things! Allegro is so close to Playa del Carmen, that we walked in either during the day or our most favourite time was right after an early dinner strolling around and exploring! This area is extremely safe and never once felt uncomfortable or concerned. I would walk (by myself) first thing in the morning...if doing so be sure to bring water, a hat and not like me remember to hydrate when returing. We had the best ever room, 5804...waking up having a coffee with only 5 steps to the pool and only a few more down the stairs @ being on the beach! Walking the beach into Playa, you can admire other resorts as well as the many homes for rent/sale, ending up by Senor Frogs. one small note is we took a taxi (my fiance worked out a great deal with one of the reputable services just outside where the bus would p/u to take to resort) because we got to the resort, signed in & bracelets on about 3-4 hours ahead of the buses.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Canucklife", "ReviewID": "UR125318934", "Content": "Location!!

On your way there you even get to see some Mayan ruins if you walk by the street , if you want romantic Playa Del Carmen is accessible by the beach.Also instead of turning right for playa Del Carmen you go left you have about 3 minutes from the hotel you have the Playacar market a small shopping area that sell souvenirs, beer and you have a drugstore.You can also find a Starbucks with FREE INTERNET. Now for the hotel this is a 3,5 star hotel and it is a little outdated it must of been great to look at 15 years ago but who cares you are not there for the room we spent all of our time outside anyway all you need is a place to sleep.The beds were comfortable, room clean,fresh linen everyday.As for the leaky roof we can't say it did not rain.The resort itself is a nice size ,all short walks to get to the pools the quiet and action pool.The beach is awesome great white sand, beautiful ocean.The food was excellent we went to the buffet and had a good selection.The a la Carte is a bust it was always booked full the buffet was sufficient. The staff are very polite and helpful ,they were just awesome!! Now for the Bad... The concierge are a pain in the .... they harass you continuously to attend one of occidental information session and promise you an upgrade to their 5 star hotel further down.We did it the Canadian way we were polite and said no on the first day and on the second but on the third we had to be a bit more firm then they left us alone.The beach lounge chairs definitely need to be replaced.

I have never placed any reviews for hotels; however, I would like to share my vacation experiences at the Allegro Playacar so you can make a better informed decision before you book your trip. Upon arrival Feb 17, 2012 we were checked into room 3115. The room is on the second floor of one of the the \"villas\". The roof is made from dried grass and ours had three holes in it and smelled very moldy. Our shower did not have ANY pressure and the A/C did not work. After complaining several times, we were finally moved to room 4204 - a first floor room on the other side of the resort. This room did have a working shower; however, the A/C, phone, TV and ceiling fan all did not work. After making complaints, the maintenance person came to fix the ceiling fan, but that was all that was fixed (we were told the A/C was being fixed the following day, but this never happened). This room was musty and humid, and all of our clothes ended up damp and smelling musty the whole week. our hammock was infested with bugs and we both received numerous bites. There are no alarm clocks in this hotel, so bring your own. When I went to the front desk to ask for one, they said that because it is a three star hotel they do not have alarm clocks. The a-la-carts were nothing special, the menu was limited and the food seemed to be pre-cooked as the pasta was dry and the vegetables were soggy. The buffet was not bad; there was a decent sized selection of apps, mains, salads, fruit/veggies and desserts. Unfortunately, most of the fruit being served was canned or flavorless. The only thing that saved eating at the hotel was the service provided by the staff - they all do what they can to make your eating experience enjoyable and entertaining. If you are looking for nightlife or any sort of evening entertainment this hotel is not for you. There is a huge stage in the courtyard, unfortunately it was only used to find Mr. Allegro one night, Mrs. Allegro the next night, and singing karaoke on the third night, then the events repeat themselves. It was funny that during the karaoke night at around 11pm the staff shut down the \"party\" as one room complained about the noise and sent around 50 people out of the area and suggested they visit the \"disco\" - a room that was 20 feet wide by 20 feet long and barely qualified as a lounge. The beach is great and you will have great service from the staff if you tip well - that goes the same for the pool areas. Lunches by the pool are good and have plenty of selection. Aside from the pool, the only redeeming feature of this hotel is its location. It is only a five minute cab ride to 5th ave in Playa Del Carmen, which is the shopping/restaurant/entertainment district. We ended up going there almost every evening as there was NOTHING to do at the hotel. Beware of Pablo the \"Lomas Travel\" representative. He is a salesman and will make you great \"deals\". Two of our three excursions were great (Xel-ha and Tulum/Coba) but the third (para-sailing) was a disaster. The day did not happen as it was \"promised\". Our private car, direct trip, turned into a tour bus carrying over 30 people and making 5 stops. The two hour activity took almost 5 hours, and did not include everything we were promised. Be careful, as Pablo tells you what you want to hear so he can get your business. We had requested late check out as our return flight was at 11pm. When we first made this request, we were told it would cost $40usd; however, when our check-out day arrived, they attempted to charge us $60usd instead. They did eventually give us a 6pm check out for $40usd, but for some reason when I went to pay upon check out the girl requested my passport so she could make a photocopy of it as I was paying cash and \"it is the law\". I payed with MC as they did not require to verify or copy your ID for that method of payment.??? We were a group of twelve on vacation that booked 6 rooms. For the most part our experiences were the same. This was not a comfortable \"resort\", the food was average, no nightlife, bugs, no AC, and an overall moldy smell. If you get a good price and can get through some of these things in the 35 degree heat then I suggest go for it. If you are looking for a fun, comfortable, relaxing resort then this place is probably not for you. I will state again that the servers were great.

You can walk on the beach to 5th avenue or through town. The area offers easy access to most excursions since they are south of the area. Rooms: There are close to 40 bungalows each housing 8 rooms. This hotel is older than surrounding hotels. The rooms provide a neat atmosphere with a straw ceiling and a king size bed. Some people complained during rainfalls since it may get through the ceiling if you're on the 2nd floor. We could hear everything the neighbors were saying since the cement walls are not very sound proof but we had read this in the reviews and brought ear plugs to help us sleep (this was not the case for everyone we talked to, maybe only on 2nd floors?). We ran out of water a few times and the toilet didn't flush half the time. Pools: 2 very nice pools, not too busy since this is a small resort. Beach: Very nice beach and very large, maybe 75 yards wide give or take. There are lots of seashells in the sand so you should watch where you walk. Nice water, green flag everyday. Food: Food was o.k., always something to eat even for picky eaters. Lots of drinks available and they provide nice drink catalogs to make it easier to choose. Never any lineups at the bars of which there are 2 during the day plus the disco in the evening. Staff: Very nice and polite staff, lots of smiles. Shows: There is a show every night for the guests, these are the same everywhere and we hate them all and avoid them as much as possible. Beach activities: The staff do a good job with daily activities. There is a free 4 hour intro to scuba course in the pool for those interested. There are organized ping pong tournaments and you can play basketball on a very nice court and tennis and beach volleyball. For the price, this is a great resort. We would never go back to the same location twice but we both recommend this resort. It is small, not a party resort for people who just want to relax. Day Trip #1: Tulum ruins, Tulum beach, Coba ruins, Cenote swim and mayan village. It was great but could be a brutal walk for older folks. Day Trip #2: Catamaran in Cancun on Isla Mujeres. It was great, lots of booze, not for old people or kids. We also took the ferry to Cozumel island and spend a few hours there. It's very nice and lots of restaurants/shops. Side note: The most annoying part of the vacation were babies on the flights. I can't understand why anyone would bring a baby on one of these trips, everyone on the flight was annoyed. It's also a form of child abuse to bring these babies in the hot sun for a week, we saw so many sunburned babies.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vernon, Canada", "Title": "\u201caverage resort\u201d", "Author": "maxspirit1965", "ReviewID": "UR124486257", "Content": "this was our second time at the Allegro.

No worries, as we were directed to the pools, buffet and beach until the room was ready in the afternoon. After checking in, we met with Yairi in Guest Services to book our a la carte reservations, and we were advised that they were overbooked and that they would be happy to move us to the Xcaret at their expense. I knew where this resort was located (farther south from PDC) and that it wasn't ideal for us, and Yairi was excellent - she made some calls and set us up at the nearby Sandos Playacar Riviera until Jan 24th. This resort was amazing and we took full advantage of its amenities. When our stay was over, we returned to the Allegro and met again with Yairi and then Miguel (or Edgar?) who graciously attended to us and provided us with a ground floor room next to the beach, in 5702 (not beachview, but very nice location and everything worked well in the room -- basic but comfortable). A big thank you goes out to Yairi, Miguel/Edgar, Ivonne and the rest of the friendly front desk staff. Overall, while the resort is admittedly one of the more dated ones in Playacar, we were very impressed with the quaintness of the resort, the quality of the staff and the grounds - immaculate! A pleasant, short walk from front lobby to beach and back. Its location within Playacar (a gated, secure subdivision of resorts and condos), its proximity to PDC and the quality of the beach are ideal. Food wise, the Italian restaurant was very good and the buffet (lunch and dinner) was varied and satisfactory for our needs and tastes. We did not take part in the Mexican a la carte near the pool so I cannot rate this. The poolside snack shack and pizzeria were very good for quick food fixes during the day. All of the staff were very attentive and always smiling and quick to give a friendly \"Hola!\". The upstairs bar was cool and often a happening spot in the early evening. The pools were clean and cool but refreshing in 26+ C humid temps and the beach was spectacular -- not crowded at all. The beach loungers on the south side of the resort seemed newer and in better condition, but plenty to choose from. You can walk for miles with nothing but white sand and turquoise water. I spent plenty of time reading mixed reviews of this resort before travelling and was worried to say the least, but after experiencing it first hand I would have to say the Allegro Playacar exceeded my expectations and will give it a two thumbs up for value and overall experience.

At 23 years of age, the Allegro is one of the original hotels in Playacar. It\u2019s smaller than most of the newer resorts \u2013 nowhere on the property is more than a two-minute walk from anywhere else, compared to as much as ten minutes at other resorts \u2013 and it\u2019s a lot more tranquil. You\u2019ll hear music around the main pool when activities like aquasize are underway, but even then the volume is pretty low. No booming club music like at the nearby Iberostar where a young couple who shared our airport shuttle told us there was nowhere out of earshot of non-stop thumping music. Allegro Playacar\u2019s grounds are attractively landscaped and well maintained, and home to a number of animals we enjoyed watching \u2013 a coati family (mom and three young), several agoutis (like a monster squirrel crossed with a monster guinea pig) and an iguana who liked to sun himself on a path. While not tame, these creatures are clearly accustomed to people, so you can get quite close to take photographs. The hotel is situated on a very nice stretch of beach, though it has a bit of an incline and, in some places, a ledge, making it a little tricky to walk along the water\u2019s edge without getting wet if there are waves. If you turn to the right, i.e., south, and walk for 15 minutes or so, you\u2019re into an undeveloped area. Walk left/north from the hotel beach for about 15 minutes and you\u2019ll reach Playa del Carmen and the pier for the Cozumel ferry. You can also walk to PdC by turning right on the road in front of the hotel lobby. We found PdC a little tacky so didn\u2019t go back, but there\u2019s no shortage of shops, restaurants and clubs, if you\u2019re so inclined. The ADO bus station is also located there, along with two collectivo terminals, one for travel north and the other for travel south. Here are some specifics that may help you decide if Allegro Playacar is for you. ACCOMMODATION The two pools occupy the central part of the property, with rooms located either side in eightplex palapas. Each palapa has four rooms on the ground floor \u2013 two on one side of the building and two on the other \u2013 and four rooms on an upper level accessed by exterior stairs. We were originally given an upper-floor room, but it had been pouring the day we arrived and the thatched roof had leaked, wetting the bed, so we were moved to the ground floor. The upper rooms are a little more private, but I found the air downstairs fresher; upstairs seemed musty, maybe because the thatch was wet. Rooms are fairly basic but clean and comfortable, and we had everything we needed \u2013 always plenty of hot water; fresh towels, some sculpted into an ever-changing parade of amusing and fanciful creatures; toiletries topped up as needed; and a 1\u00bd-litre bottle of water left in the room each day. Every room has a patio or balcony with a table, two chairs and a hammock. Our room was close to the beach and opposite the hedge separating Allegro Playacar from a Viva Wyndham property. Not the most scenic spot, perhaps, but it was quiet. Rooms close to the theatre (lobby end of the property) are probably rather noisy when the evening shows take place. FOOD AND DRINKS Breakfast and dinner are served in the main restaurant, above the lobby, lunch at the small restaurant between the two pools (it doubles in the evening as the Mexican \u00e0 la carte). We were impressed by the variety at all the buffets. We\u2019re not picky eaters, but we do eat gluten-free, which can sometimes be a challenge in restaurants. However, we had no difficulty finding things we could eat \u2013 lots of fish, chicken, pork and beef dishes, vegetables, salads, cheeses, egg dishes, fresh fruit and delicious yogurts. You can have things like omelets made to order, but we always found so much selection at the buffet that we never bothered. There\u2019s a different theme every evening \u2013 Caribbean, Mexican, Asian, etc. \u2013 so you shouldn\u2019t get bored. And the two \u00e0 la cartes (Mexican and Italian) were both enjoyable. Best to make reservations when you arrive, as they seem to book up quickly. Our only criticism of the restaurants was the house red wine, which was truly dreadful. The white was okay, but the red had an unpleasant smell of nail polish remover and tasted like vinegar. Why Occidental would choose such a poor quality of wine is beyond me. I believe it\u2019s a Spanish chain, and we were told the wine is Spanish, so perhaps there\u2019s some corporate loyalty to the homeland, but personally, I find it misplaced. All other drinks were good, if a bit syrupy. We finally settled on mojitos, which were less sweet than most others. SPORTS The hotel has two tennis courts, both in excellent condition and night-lit. Most days we played early morning and late afternoon, though with the breeze coming off the ocean, it was actually comfortable enough to play at other times. We took our own racquets and balls. Not sure if you can borrow or rent equipment at the hotel, but you can certainly arrange lessons with the pro (US $30/hr, I think). Had there been more green-flag days on the beach (we had only one), we would have looked into water sports. Our vacation package included boogie boards, windsurfing, kayaking and catamaran, though we never saw any equipment at the activities desk or on the beach. Perhaps it\u2019s available at some other location. POOLS As mentioned, there are two. The activities pool also has a swim-up bar so is probably a little more social. The relaxation pool, shaped like a figure eight with a little bridge over the centre, is perfect is you\u2019d just like to lie back and read. Both have plenty of chaises longues, and waiters will bring you drinks. STAFF Everyone we dealt with, from bar and restaurant waiters to front desk staff, housekeeping and guest services, was friendly and attentive and spoke excellent English. There seems to be a pretty high ratio between staff and guests. We never had to wait for any service, and there always seemed to be someone on hand, at restaurants or poolside, to sweep up any crumb as soon as it got dropped. ENTERTAINMENT There\u2019s some type of show every evening. We enjoyed three lively and colourful performances by a professional dance company. Each show had a different theme \u2013 Latin, Mexican folkloric and variety \u2013 with multiple costume changes. These performances alternated with entertainment provided by the hotel activities staff, including a beach party, comedy night and karaoke contest. Can\u2019t comment on any of these shows as we didn\u2019t attend. EXCURSIONS We had visited the Mayan ruins at Tulum and Coba on a previous vacation and wanted to try something different. Ruling out Chichen Itza because it seemed too far, we opted for Ek Balam, about 2\u00bd hours from Playacar. Unlike Tulum and Coba, this site is a bit off the beaten track and doesn\u2019t seem to be reachable by collectivo and/or ADO bus, so we booked an Alltournative tour through our Nolitours rep at the hotel. Ek Balam isn\u2019t as well known as other Mayan sites, consequently has far fewer visitors, and our group had the place almost to ourselves. Visitors are allowed to enter any building and climb the pyramid, not as high as the one at Coba but in better condition and containing the tomb of an ancient ruler. The tomb is surrounded by an astonishingly well-preserved stucco wall replete with statues and carvings. Next stop was a cenote that we rappelled into \u2013 initially a little scary, but then fun, and the water wasn\u2019t nearly as cold as anticipated. We also ziplined inside the cenote (into the water \u2013 you have no choice), then had a bland but adequate lunch at the cenote park. While I support Alltournative\u2019s mission to involve the Mayan community so they get some benefit from tourism, I suspect we might have got better value with another tour operator. After returning home, I learned that Ek Balam is only about 20 minutes from the colonial town of Valladolid, worth a visit in itself, and from there it\u2019s not far to Chichen Itza. Had we booked with Mayans\u2019 Explorers, for instance, we could have visited Valladolid and Chichen Itza as well as Ek Balam and a cenote, all for the same price (US $129 pp) or less, and with fewer people in the group. Check Tripadvisor reviews for both Alltournatives and Mayans\u2019 Explorers and see what you think. A TIMESHARE BY ANY OTHER NAME.... Other than the red wine, the only thing we didn\u2019t care for at Allegro Playacar was the sales pitch that kind of snuck up from behind. We were told that Allegro was overbooked so we\u2019d be offered the opportunity to move to another hotel in the chain, the Grand Xcaret, which has four stars as opposed to the Allegro\u2019s three. Not wishing to consider such a move sight unseen, we arranged to visit the Grand Xcaret, about ten minutes south of Playacar, to check it out. This, in fact, turns out to be a pitch to have you buy into Occidental\u2019s \u201cvacation club,\u201d a timeshare in everything but name. It\u2019s one thing to be hit on by timeshare salespeople in town, but I find it poor business practice for a hotel to victimize its own guests. And by the way, we preferred Allegro Playacar even if it had one less star than the Grand Xcaret, so we decided to stay put.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flin Flon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing time!\u201d", "Author": "Cailiejan", "ReviewID": "UR123982158", "Content": "We had an amazing time here!

You also can show up for the flight slightly later than those travels who do not already have their seats booked. The Allegro all inclusive resort in Playacar was great! It is only rated a 3.5 to 4 star, but the service is 5 star for sure. The grounds of the resort are great. The rooms are a little rustic, but gives you the feeling you are in Mexico. I enjoyed the rustic atmosphere of the room. I recommend the upper floor of the 8 suite buildings (4 suites on ground floor...4 suites on upper floor) in order to get the vaulted ceiling and the view of the grass roof from the inside. I believe most of the upper floor rooms have king size beds while most of the lower floor rooms have 2 double beds. I also recommend a building location close to the pool and ocean. All rooms have a patio (lower floor) or deck (upper floor) with a hammock that works great. NOTE: Due to the grass roofs, some upper floor rooms could drip a few drops of water during a heavy rain. This happened in our room, but we enjoyed that too. All you have to do is wipe up the small pool of water on the tile floor with a towel and it is dry again. I ask you...where else can you stay where your room will have a grass roof? This is a memory I will NEVER forget! The staff in all areas of the resort are well trained so I tipped a lot to acknowledge that fact. The entertainment/activities staff work very hard offering activities during the day around the pool and at night hosting shows in the theatre (and beach parties if that is on the agenda). The restaurant, bar and domestic staff work with a smile ALL THE TIME so I tipped, tipped, tipped (just $1 USD) everytime they did something for me. The professional dancers that perform in the theatre (about every second night) are very well trained and put on unique shows. During one show I lost count after 10 costume changes. NOTE: There is only a few seconds of delay before the next number would start. HOW DO THEY CHANGE SO QUICKLY? This was very impressive as was their talent, energy, fitness level, muscle tone, make-up and looks. I enjoyed the food in the Italian a la carte and at the buffets. The food was excellent at this resort...always something good to eat because of the wide selection. Sorry I did not try the Mexican a la carte, but I saw lots of people using it. Check out the \"snack shack\" near the lunch buffet. They seem to BBQ something different everyday along with the expected beef burgers. The feeling of safety in the Playacar area and on this resort are second to none. Playacar is a gated area of Play del Carmen and no unauthorized vehilces enter this area. The fact that the shopping district of Play del Carmen's 5th Avenue is a $7 taxi ride or a 20 - 30 minute walk away (walk on the beach or on the street) makes this resort's location the best I ever experienced in Mexico. The beach was very nice and safe. The water colour is amazing! You can walk a long way down the beach in both directions and view the other resorts in the area. I believe you can book parasailing, subba diving and snorkling excursions, etc. right on the beach (just a short walk 5 min walk from the Allegro resort). The beach walks and activities are a definite plus. I did not experience one \"time share\" sales pitch while staying in this area. I would go back to Allegro in Playacar in a minute for all the reasons mentioned above.\"", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ridgeway, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great time !!\u201d", "Author": "ddetlor", "ReviewID": "UR123381761", "Content": "The beach, the staff and area are all just great !!

The resort is a good 3.5....if they would update the rooms a bit it would be a good 4..... we had a great time with NO complaints at all........if we wanted a 5 star we would have gone to one. We would go back and we were with our girls 15 and 10 who also had a great time !!! The only problem I had was NO STRAWS if you like a straw bring some. The walk to town is about 15min. and very safe.We got some really great deals. You just must know how to handle the pushy people and bargan with them. Drop them alot and walk away if you must. My husband got a little tired of the draft but drinks were good and so was the selection. The mexician food was very good. Entertainment was ok better on some nights. I was selected one night and had a blast ! Only wish I had a video of it. So as long as your not a snob and are looking for a 5 star. This hotel is well worth it. We stayed Jan. 10 - 18th.

The shuttle from the airport took about an hour and half. It takes a while for them to load up with enough people then they make stops along the way. We got a great deal so for the price it was AWESOME! LOCATION: The resort is right on a beautiful beach in a row of other resorts. It's about a 25 min. walk down the beach or by street to get to Playa Del Carmen. About 5 mins away in the other direction is a small plaza of shops. This is where the tours picked us up. HOTEL ROOM: The resort is nice for a 3 star. It's one of the only Mexican style resorts left in the area. There are over twenty bungalow style places each with about 8 rooms. The ones on the top have a thatched roof. Not good in the rain, luckily we were at the bottom. Also people on the top floor said you could hear everything in the rooms beside them since they shared one roof. The bathroom had been updated but not totally redone. The beds are on hard cement but I talked to many people in other resorts and theres was the same. WEATHER: It does rain this time of year. So one evening it rained several inches in about 40 mins, two night it rained continuously but was gone shortly after midmorning. There was one day it rained about 10 hours equaling about a foot of rain. The resort has no activities should this occur. All activities are outdoor ones and there are not many spots to go that do not have the thatched roof, which leaks. FOOD/Drink: The drinks were great. There are only 3 bars, one by the buffet with limited seating, one at the pool and one in the disco which is only open in the evenings. The buffet is open for breakfast and dinner. The food trays are put on metal plates that are supposed to keep it hot, but most food was cold. The buffets were 70% the same each night. Each night had a theme with a little decor. Breakfast got boring quick. There was at least one station that would make hot food on demand but only one item (ex. breakfast, eggs or omelettes and at dinner one meat would be served there) so it would be hot. Lunch is served by the pool & mexican ala cart. Lunch is the steam food trays over hot water so it was hot and always good. The ala carts are okay at least the food is hot. SERVICE: The staff are great! Some have very limited or no English but all are happy, personable and very helpful. The entertainment staff (Hector & Victor especially) were fantastic. The waiters are always singing and in a good mood. We especially liked Jacobo. Our rooms were cleaned daily, fresh towels and each day a new character made of towels was on my bed when I got back to the room. EXCURSIONS: We took the ferry to Cozamel. Tip there are two companies working in tandum and if you buy a return ticket you can only return on their ferry which does not always have great return times, so buy a one way ticket then on the way back you can get a one way for the next returning ferry no matter what company it is. It's about $13 USD one way. We did a tour to Tulum for $43 US, it's a fairly small ruin but has a great beach. It's only a half hour away. We also went to Snorkle with the turtles in Akumal it was $79ish. They picked you up, brought you to the jungle to swim in a natural cenote for about 1/2 hour then bring you to the ocean in Akumal to snorkle with the turtles for about 40 mins. Note: you could take the public bus for $3 US and either use your own snorkle equipment or rent theirs. The only good thing about the tour is someone with an underwater camera swims with you and takes photos. This CD is $25 US. It would have been nice to be there longer as the beaches are beautiful. I would definately go again.

The resort is definitely dated, but kept very clean and tidy. The grounds and gardens are really beautiful with mature plants and trees. The transfer to the hotel was good, bus was new and clean. The attendant, Joel, was funny and helpful with information about Mexico, and the area. Check in was average, not too slow, as AI resorts often are. Staff seemed like they were always a bit overwhelmed, tense and not overly friendly. It seemed like they had a lots to deal with, the hotel was completely full. Our room was fine, basic, which we were expecting. Very clean, had a fridge, coffee maker, in room safe etc. We asked the house keeper(with a small tip) to leave 2 or 3 bottles of water in our room, as they only leave one. We did have some trouble with our safe, but that was figured out. Although, I wouldn't necessarily use the safe next time, as it seemed like anyone working on the grounds could reset the password... The beach is lovely! Such soft, creamy coloured, \"flour-like\" sand. What was nice, and what really convinced us to book this hotel, is that it is right on the beach. Some of the other resorts are on a huge piece of property, and you have to walk 20 minutes just to get to the beach from your room. The beach is also cleaned every day or so of seaweed and garbage, so it is very pristine. The pools were clean and nice. Lots of activities went on in and around the pool right in front of the beach; stretching, yoga, aqua aerobics, jenga, ping pong tournaments etc. I personally don't like to do that stuff in front of the whole resort, so I didn't really get involved. Safe was really on it, cleaning up glasses and garbage and kept the place tidy. The food was really decent actually, quite a bit of variety. I found breakfast to be the best, chilquillies, beans, omelet station, tons of fruit, fresh juice, french toast, waffles, cereal, pastries... Lunch got pretty boring fast because the buffet moves down to the restaurant by the pool, and the variety is pretty lacking. I did however love that there was always fresh salad stuff; beets, carrots, lettuce, radish and bean sprouts. I don't eat wheat or dairy, and there was quite a lot of stuff I could eat. You can always just asked for corn tortillas and make tacos with whatever ingredients you find, I did this a lot. There is also a BBQ which had burgers, hot dogs, fries etc. This seemed to be pretty popular with some of the big eaters. If you don't do dairy, then I might suggest bringing those little tetra packs of soy milk for your coffee etc. I just drank my coffee black. We made a few trips into Playa del Carmen and the little shopping area in Playacar. Both are major tourist traps, annoying men harassing you to buy their stuff and when you don't being totally rude to you. I actually wanted to buy some silver from this shop in Playacar, and the shop keeper was such a jerk, I had to leave, and it totally threw me off of shopping for the rest of the trip. Everything is way over priced at the markets, and on the streets, do not expect to get a good deal in this area. So a few things on the bad list.... - We had to switch rooms as we were in the unit right by the genorator, which was so loud, even with ear plugs, the vibration kept me up for 2 nights. This unit is building 25, so any rooms with 25 first. The hotel was full so it took 2 days to switch rooms, until someone checked out. - The second room we moved to completely flooded when it rained, there was about an inch of water on the floor, and water was literally POURING onto our bed. I can't describe how frustrating this was after we had just switched rooms and unpacked our stuff. The staff at the front desk were overwhelmed with all the people in the same situation as we were.. I think there must have been about 8-10 rooms that were leaking from the rain. We were in Unit 14 on the top floor. So we were moved to the other Occidental resort, Excaret. We got a basic room, which was quite a bit more updated than our room at the Allegro, so it was a nice change I guess. We tried to look on the bright side, change of scenery. There was a bottle of sparkling wine in our new room(Unit 22, and it didn't leak the next time it rained) with a letter of apology for the inconvenience. - We refused to pay for the room safe at the end of our stay, but it would have been $2US per night. - Beach chairs are really uncomfortable, they are probably 20+ years old. But there was always enough of them for everyone. - Internet access is only in the front lobby, and it costs a lot, I can't exactly remember, but I think it was $30US for a hour...? - Drinks are overly sweet, I asked for \"NO Sweet\" and they were much better. And if you drink beer, you might be disappointed, as there is ONLY Corona on tap, and it's bad. Bar staff was always helpful, and wanted to make you happy! - Be warned of the Occidental staff that is right outside the lobby, as they are trying to get you to view a time share in their other resort, the Excaret. Unless of course you want to spend $50,000US on 25 years of time shares! They are very persistent and pushy, and do not let on what their real intentions are. \"Just come and view the property, take a few photos, and show your friends back home how nice it is, so then maybe they will want to come there in the future\" is what the man told us. We were told we would get a free bottle of tequila 100% agave, t shirts and a beach bag. We were not told it was a time share, vacation club, or that it was high pressure sales, would take over 3 hours out of our day, and make us so frustrated. Be aware, those friendly guys are working on commission to get you over to that over resort so they can try to pressure you into a 25 year commitment!! Anyways, enough bad. We really did have a fun trip, the food was better than expected, the bar staff and restaurant staff are great and friendly, the beach is amazing, the hotel grounds are beautifully kept, there is lots to do as far as sports and activities. We went to one show at the theatre, and it was a dance show. It was good, talented dancers, pretty girls and lively music. It seemed like every night there was lots of applause and cheering coming from the theatre and mini disco. This resort is definitely 2-3 stars, so if you are expecting that, then it's a great place.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cIts a 3.5 star, so expect a 3.5 star!\u201d", "Author": "Frenzy_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR123182390", "Content": "We stayed in the Occidental Allegro Playacar from Jan 9-16, 2012.

This is our third time to Mexico (we normally spend 10 days), we always stay at the Occidental Grand Xcaret in the Royal Club but we really wanted to check out the Allegro Playacar as we have heard great things about this smaller resort in the Occidental family. Since we are \u2018regulars\u2019 now at the Xcaret, they drove us over to the Allegro and we spent the entire day there, and we were thrilled. The Allegro Playacar is in an area the we would term as a \u2018gated community\u2019, it is a nice little area with many residential homes, a Starbucks ! (made my day, a short walk from the resort) and some other little stores. The whole Playacar area is just very nice, comfortable and safe since you cannot get into the community unless you live there or work there (or obviously are staying at one of the resorts in the area). The grounds of the Allegro are absolutely gorgeous, they are clean, beautifully manicured and well, what else can I say\u2026. you will see grounds keepers constantly maintaining them. Lots of pride goes into their work. Accommodations: The rooms are located in villa type buildings, two-story with an average of four rooms per building. The rooms are an adequate size for one or two people, large bed, armoire with a flat screen TV, safe, ceiling fan, A/C, closet, clean and bright washroom, and separate sink area (euro design, the bathrooms have certainly been updated). If you are travelling with more than two people they open up the adjoining door (which normally locks on both sides) and essentially give you two rooms (therefore 2 bathrooms for a family of four- this works well!) They also have Vacation Club rooms \u2013 which are suite type rooms (more like what we are used to in the Royal Club at the Xcaret). Everything is clean, bright and the curtains, bedding, towels, etc. are clean, not worn and are well maintained. Sure you might find a little gecko living in your room, but if that is something that will ruin your trip then just stay home, you\u2019re in a tropical country and lizards and other giant bugs are the norm here. I had seen some comments on this site in the past about it being unclean, and things needing to be fixed. But apart from our room, we were shown many rooms in other buildings and their views and clearly everything has been updated since the new manager took over around December 2010. We did not see anything that was in need of repair or anything that was unclean. Food: Food is fabulous, even lots of food for my picky children! The Beach/pool restaurant serves anything from Hamburgers to pasta to seafood and salads, lots to choose from. They have a separate area where you can get pizza, and even a little BBQ area where you will find the burgers and hot dogs. You can eat inside the restaurant or outside at the many tables available. They also have the buffet at the main building and another restaurant which is escaping me right now, only because we didn\u2019t eat in there (but saw it and the d\u00e9cor was beautiful) \u2013 I think it was an Italian Restaurant. Much to the Occidental experience we have at the Xcaret- the food at the Allegro Playacar is also great! If you need something just ask. At breakfast you will have make your own omelets, and all of the other traditional North American breakfast items in addition to some traditional Mexican favourites, so there is always LOTS to choose from. I will throw this in here only because I have been asked so many times, and in hindsight when travelling with the kids it was a question I had too. MILK: Coming from a family where we drink tons of milk (normally skim milk here in Canada) the milk available at the resort tastes just like good old Canadian milk- however I would compare it more to a 1 % or 2 %. The kids drank it daily without EVER making a comment that it was \u2018different\u2019 or \u2018tasted funny\u2019, and they even offer chocolate milk, which makes life easy too. I was relieved that they would still drink the milk, as I did not want the kids having pop every day just because we are on vacation. The fruit juices were also very nice and pure. Service and Tipping: The service at the Allegro is top-notch just like what we are used to at the Xcaret (which keeps us coming back), and because of this we will be back to the Allegro Playacar as well. Do not be surprised when they walk by with a smile and \u2018hola\u2019 and ask if you need anything. You will encounter this all the time, from many different staff members, I think because they are a smaller resort they have the ability to be even more personable and this is a very large asset for them. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to see people not tipping just because they are eating at a buffet or thinking somehow that \u2018all inclusive\u2019 means that your tips are somehow included. These people work very hard. For the most part they work 12 hour days, more hours at peak time and still only make about $ 12.00 USD a DAY ! Yes, I said A DAY ( this is just the country\u2019s norm) For those of us who make much more than that an hour, it shouldn\u2019t kill you to tip for service that you appreciate. Please don\u2019t be a spoiled tourist, we are all humans and should treat others with respect. Ok, I just had to vent, I have just seen so much ignorance over the years. Much of their income depends on tips; it is part of their culture and it is appreciated more than you know. Normally we tip the maids, restaurant servers, our excursion tour guides and the bar staff. But don\u2019t forget about the groundskeepers, and so many others that work just as hard but are not necessarily front line with the customers. When I see the same groundskeeper for a few days, I tip him. Beach and pools: The 2 pools are beautiful and clean, lots of pool side chairs available and towels whenever you need them. The beach is clean, and the water is a beautiful shade of blue. Even the day we were there, it was very windy, the red flags went up advising people not to go into the water (the waves just get so big) but still a beautiful sight (see my pictures). The sand is clean and clearly regularly groomed for litter and seaweed. The Allegro is smaller that what we are used to at the Xcaret, but we really liked the ambiance. I would say it is \u2018quaint\u2019 and very friendly. We just spent the day there and still made many new friends. It is child friendly, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot have a good party time there. If you want more of a party time, as for a villa near the pool/bar/restaurant area. If you are travelling with children and want some early nights in bed this is easy too as there are villas away from the music and night life. There IS something here for everyone! Like I said though- if there is something you need, just ask as they are VERY accommodating and eager to please, but they don\u2019t read minds. So before you complain ask for what you need! This train of thought goes for anywhere you may visit. Clearly great pride is taken by the management and staff at the Allegro ~ thank you for a wonderful day and this coming August we will be spending five days at the Allegro and five days at the Xcaret !

I think for myself the biggest problem was I had the luxury of staying two weeks at the Grand Palladium White Sands Resort & Spa last year and set the bar way to high. The Allegro is an older resort and during our stay there it seemed it was always being repaired by workers at the resort (wood twig railings going to the second level suites). They would also clean the pool while we were in it (scubbing tiles with cleaners) Transportation: After arriving in Cancun and boarded the bus, it took a very long time to get to the resort as a result of dropping people off at two other hotels. What compounded the delays was the amount of time we got stuck behind vehicles and golf carts left in front of the resorts and for some reason the drivers couldn't be found. It took us an additional hour to finally get to the Allegro. Check-in: Checking into the Allegro seem to go without a hitch and the staff was quick to get us to our suites. The one thing I did realize was that there were not a lot of people around and the resort almost seemed empty. Room: Arriving in the room it was easy to see that this is an older resort when looking at the rough plaster patchwork done on the ceiling of the bathroom and chipped tiles on the floor throughout the room. The curtains had also seen better days. The overall appearance of the room is not an overly big deal as we spend very little time in it. More importantly, the king size bed provided me with the comfort and sleep I needed. Pools/Beach The pools were somewhat small with the one pool (with bridge across it) being the main area for all the children at the resort and given the time of year was a tad bit on the cold side. The pool with the volleyball net and swim up bar was almost never used and I don't recall a single moment ever seeing anyone sitting at the swim-up bar which may have been a result of how cold the water was. On two of the days, the water level of the main pool was so low that it made it difficult to even swim in it. The beach was great and was where we spent the majority of our time because there were so few people staying at the resort. The beach here was was far better than the Grand Palladium with almost no coral on the beach or in the water. Food/Restaurants: The food and restaurants were probably the most disappointing aspect of the Allegro and especially the buffet upstairs. In saying this, I am not sure if it is because of what I had experienced at the Grand Palladium or I was just expecting too much. The selection of food served at the Allegro buffet was somewhat limited and worse of all it was more often cold than even warm. Breakfast (bacon, eggs, sausages) were almost always luke warm to cold and on several days was in short supply with many people waiting for the staff to bring out more. On one occasion, a fresh new tray of bacon came out and it was cold as if it had been sitting in the back for a time. The Italian restaurant was not too bad and was almost empty on any given night and the Mexican restaurant never did open during our stay and not sure why. Overall, I would say that the food aspect was the most disappointing part of our stay other than the buffet between the pools seemed to be busy throughout the day once it opened and especially the hamburger hut of to the left of it. Beverages/Alcohol: The one thing I can say is that this resort did not hold back on serving alcohol and in abundance. If you ordered a rum & coke, you could almost guarantee you would get a triple or quadruple as a drink serving. No point waiting to be served because few if any staff came by the beach or your chair to serve you. This was definitely a self-serve resort for alcohol. Internet/other services: The real negative about the Allegro was that there was no free internet as offered by other resorts. The cost was US$50/week for access and most if not all people just walked the block down to the Starbucks coffee shop to access the Internet. The other issue was that you had to pay $2 a day to use the in room safe which i found to be a bit cheap for even this resort.

Small resort that although was very close to amenties it had a private, relaxed and secure feeling. Rooms, spacious and clean.

The first set of rooms up by the lobby were in desperate need of a paint job and bathroom reno's but the second set of rooms were updated and nice. Staff: Fantastic... very helpful and friendly. Limburg stands out as a favourite as well as the Manager Miguel who was very helpful and personable. Food... Excellent.. lots of variety and different theme nights during our week stay so even though there are not a lot of restuarant options, you had a good variety and didnt have to eat the same thing everyday. we only did a la carte once at the Italian and it was amazing!!! Kids club, not the best I have seen but not the worst. This is actually the only time we have brought our small children and they were leary about going to kids club but once they gave it a try they were eager to go back, lots of activities and the staff there was great. Grounds. Well maintained and clean, the beach is beautiful and clean. Overall: we have a great vacation. New years eve dinner and entertainment were excellent. Great place for a young family to go without the fear of children being lost in a large resort. Staff is approachable and accomodating... Enjoy your time there..

Loved this place, it was so clean and tidy. Room: was spotless and it was near the beach, I loved it's location. Fresh towels everyday which I love. Food: was good, something to suit everyone, even for the fusiest eater. Though sometimes the food was only lukewarm. I prefer my food to be hot, so that it can cool down as I'm eating, but that's just me. What can I say about the cocktails, I loved them, they make part of my holiday. Staff: were awesome. All the staff were charming, polite and curteous. Alexis in Reception was so professional and such a gentleman. The waiting and bar staff were just the best - Carlos (who kissed my hand every evening I went for dinner), Fausto, Candido, Enrique, Victor, Jacabo (who sung to me every morning I went for breakfast), not to mention Ivan and Miguel who made the best cocktails and were so entertaining. Thank you all for looking after me so much, you made this one the best times for me. And last but not least, thanks to Neri for all the cuppuccino's you made me, you are fantastic! Beach: very clean and no problem in getting a sunlounger. I found my own wee quiet spot and it was great. Entertainment staff: these guys and girls work very hard and thanks to Adan (so professional, helpful and such a gentleman), Sergio, Victor and Lester (who I know has now left). You guys got me involved in some of the activities and I even won a t-shirt. As for the entertainment in the evenings, I feel this could be improved on. There was a lot of shows put on by dancers, don't get me wrong, they were very enjoyable but some live music, ie band or singer, would've been good for a change. If you didn't want to leave the resort after the entertainment there was nowhere really to sit and have a drink. There is a disco which is very good but I feel that putting some wicker tables/chairs/sofas around the courtyard area near the stage area and just outside the disco would be good as if you want a drink but don't want to stay in the disco you can still sit outside and enjoy the great atmosphere of this place. This is just a personal opinion, as a solo traveller I find it easier to meet people this way rather than in a noisy bar/disco. The New Year's Eve party, well what can I say, this place just excelled, one of THE best nights I've had. You had to be there to appreciate it. All in all, this holiday has to be in one of my top 5 and I am planning returning Christmas/New Year 2012. Oh and can I please have a table and chair outside the disco bar if I do ... thanks!", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cAllegro Playacar over New Year's\u201d", "Author": "Matildah", "ReviewID": "UR122713892", "Content": "We just returned from a week at this resort, and loved it. The staff are very friendly. The food was great - even though the main restaurant is a buffet, the type of food was always changing, fresh and plentiful. The hours for all meals span a 4 hour period (bkfast= 7-11, lunch=12-4 poolside, and din= 6-10). There was never a line up for food like some other larger resorts. The resort was at capacity while we were there, but you would not have known it. The beach area is huge -- and best bonus ever: no lounger hogging! (ie you don't have to wake up at dawn to get a lounger). The beach is lovely and since the resort is smaller than neighbouring ones, there is lots of room on the beach. There is beach volleyball, pool volleyball, tennis and basketball. Other activities are going all day long if you choose to participate. The rooms are located in little bungalow thatched roof buildings that house 8 rooms. The upper level rooms have a great high ceiling and a balcony. The lower level rooms have a terrace - both are quite nice. Be aware however, the birds love to sit at the peak of the roof and sing their hearts out at sunrise! The area of the resort is the gated community of Playacar. It is quite nice filled with modern homes and cobblestone roads. We ran around the area and felt as safe as we do at home. The walk to town was a leisurely 20 minutes and quite enjoyable. There is also a plaza close by (3 mins) that has souvenir shops and a Starbucks. That made for a nice excursion. They did a great job over the holidays providing a lovely New Year's Eve gala and also a special poolside dinner with a fire show and dancing on the beach.

The rooms are still rather dated, but who spends a lot of time in their room. In our suite, the old soapstone tub had been fitted with a new fiberglass tub insert. No matter how much you clean soapstone, it always looks dirty, so this was a nice change. The bottom line is that for the money, it is a great resort.

The staff is fantastic, especially the entertainment crew and the bartenders/waiters. They really go out of their way to make you feel welcomed and take care of your every need. The only complaint I have is that I didn't see many tourists tipping?! Mind you, it seemed like there were many Europeans in the Mayan and they are not use to tipping so...?! Remember, the local wages are pathetically low and the staff relies on tips to support their families, so be kind and generous:)) The location is perfect, walking to Playa Del Carmen is maybe 20 min and then you can walk about 30 min in the other direction to a beautiful raw beach landscape of sand, rock and palm trees, great exercise in the sand:) And the beach is to die for, seriously...heaven on earth!! I travelled with a girl friend (we are late 40's) and 3 kids (ages 17-21) and we had a blast. We are pretty active people and the kids played beach volleyball everyday and engaged in many of the activities around the resort. There are so many things to do off the resort. It really depends on the type of person you are. We snorkeled in some cenotes, spent a half day in Akumel snorkeling with turtles etc and went to Tulum to see the ruins. Next time, I will get over to Cozumel and Isla de Mujeres:) I guess the fact that we didn't do all the things we wanted to is a testament to the resort, we were just having so much fun that we didn't want to leave most days!! I was worried about the food, but we were all really impressed, tons of variety yum! Actually I am really missing it right about now lol. My girl friend is allergic to gluten and she could eat most things, and the chefs made her special dinners if needed which was awesome! So in summary, I think this resort is an amazing choice for the price. It is not 5 star people so don't go there if that is what you are wanting. This resort is small and quaint, literally 2 min walk from any room to the beach or buffet. Some of the larger resorts are 15 min walks from rooms to beach, so just keep that in mind when booking:) If I were to go back to the Mayan then I would stay here. Enjoy your trip!

We think it all depends upon what you want and your expectations. It's a beautiful property, in an ideal location on the beach. It's relatively small, quiet and peaceful. We were fortunate to be placed in the \"First Club\" section and in a beautiful suite.... so our viewpoint is a bit jaded. The rooms (thatched room units) are clean and simple. Because the property is small, you are always a short walk to the beach, pool or one of the restaurants. The buffets are fine - good choice of styles of food and quality is good. The Italian restaurant (need reservations) was excellent ! The Mexican restaurant (need reservations) was fine.... but there was so much Mexican food anyway.... wasn't really necessary. Buffet dinner changes themes each night. This is NOT a big fancy mega resort. There are many of these in Playacar and Riviera Maya. If you are looking for marble, fancy dining, big pools, beach chairs that require you getting up at 6am to place your stuff on.... then this isn't for you. If you like hammocks, feet in the sand and wading/swimming in the water --- this is your place. The entertainment at Allegro is pathetic...... yet in a funny way. Worth stopping in --- but if you are looking for a resort with nighttime activities you will be disappointed. This is a laid back place. Take a day trip and go to Akumal to snorkel with the turtles and to the cenotes (caves).

This resort could not have a nicer beach with white sand and clear blue water. It was truly beautiful. The buffet food was good and always changing. One night would be a Mexican dinner, the next Italian to All American and so on. The staff members were exceptionally friendly and continuously made efforts to play games, join activities, spend time getting to know you, answered any questions that we could think of and since we were there close to christmas, many offered to tell us about their Mexican traditions. The rooms were very simple, nothing extravagent. If you are looking to spend most of your vacation time inside your hotel room, do not book with Allegro. However, if you are looking to spend most of your time out on the fantastic beach, playing with your children or sipping cocktails in the sand, playing many fun beach activities, are determined to play games, interact with the staff members, enjoy nightly entertainment, and are looking forward to experiencing different food and such . . . book with Allegro! :) If you are an open minded person, easy going and loves a nice beach, Allegro is the place for you!

We have stayed at 5 star resorts just a few minutes up the beach and at the end of the day it was the same beach here as a few resorts up. We spend enough time in our room to sleep so the fact that they are a little tired doesn't concern us. We don't go on vacation to sit in our room. The rooms are very clean and well taken care of by the housekeeping staff. Every day we came back from the beach to a clean, organized room with a cute animal creation on our beds. Yes the beds are firm, but other than the obnoxious neighbors in the room behind us that had no concern for anyone else but themselves we slept great! The neighbours activities only interrupted our slumber for a few minutes anyway and this was largely due to the fact that our particular room could be an adjoining room if necessary so the seal around the doors was not that efficient. The resort has lovely, well manicured grounds. There is a lack of outdoor seating in the upper area of the resort near the lobby and evening buffet. It would have been nice to be able to sit outside following our meal for a little while. Since we arrived the week following Tropical Storm Rina, its possible it had just been stored for the period of bad weather, if not the resort should invest in some. There are lots of new beach chairs and ample beach to enjoy. We prefer the beach to the pool but the pool was clean and maintained daily. There is a new gourmet coffee bar, and Neri will make you an excellent cappucino with a smile. In my opinion the food had improved over last year. There were several dishes to choose from so everyone can find something they like. There were several excellent fresh fish dishes this year and overall all food was fresh and well prepared. We only had one night that the heating trays did not work as efficiently and some of the dishes were a little cold. The staff are friendly and courteous. The resort is working on some updating and some of the rooms have been closed for complete overhauls. Several balconies were being repaired while we were there. So again, if you are looking for excellent value for your money you cannot go wrong here. The resort is a little tired, but clean, the staff are friendly and efficient and the beach is the same from one resort to the next!

You should know some things about Mexico before you go. Mexican time is slow- don't go expecting anything to be on time. In fact don't go with any expectations and you will enjoy your holiday so much more. Also, it's a 3rd world country and there is rubble, cockroaches, and poverty. Read up about your location before you go. Do not drink the water or even brush your teeth with it. Take note not to open your mouth in the shower like I do in the morning! Leave the tap off when brushing your teeth to avoid the habit of running the water over your toothbrush. \u00a0Otherwise, this resort is good water-wise as they do wash the produce in chlorinated water. Take immodium in case your tummy rejects the foods and be moderate with your intake!! \u00a0The food \u00a0was very good. The meals had something for everyone every night, and you'll see some of the same stuff each day - but it is good and fresh. \u00a0Go see Neri for gourmet coffee by the pool. This guy is so nice and makes excellent cappuccino with a genuine smile. The staff here are truly incredible. I've been to a lot of resorts from 2-5 star and this place makes the cut of excellence. They will do everything possible to make you happy. If you're a rude and arrogant person you may find otherwise- but that's life. Everyone there works really hard so be appreciative to get the best service. The pool guys are the fitness staff and the evening show staff. Shows were nothing great but fun participationary shows. But they are very fun people. My room was cleaned every day- the sheets so white and clean pulled fresh over the extra firm bed - ( all beds here are quite hard- even the club beds are hard) so be prepared for that. This place is a bit tired and out-dated. If your looking for luxury look somewhere else. If you're looking or best value service on an economy budget this place is your best. They do try to sell you a time share but once you firmly state you will absolutely not be interested, they do not hassle you as I've read in previous reviews. \u00a0The rooms are far from soundproof so expect to hear others in adjoining rooms. Most people realize this immediately and share the courtesy of remaining peaceable while in their rooms. We went with three other couples and one couple experienced a very rude encounter every night. Some people are just rude and think they need to put on a show. If it were us beside these inconsiderate folks, we would have not been too shy to tell them off after the first night. Ear plugs are are great addition to your suitcase- even for the plane ride -they are a plus. There are beautiful animals around the resort. A little 'runny' is like a large hare with porcupine-like hair , no tail and are very tame and harmless. Iguana are here too and little wee croaking lizards- as well as pretty Mexican raccoons that are super friendly. The hotel photographer brings down exotic animals each day to the beach to get pictures with. The surf is strong here. The water and beach are excellent but you need to go elsewhere for calm serene beaches. Or there is a nice pool! We took a day trip to Maroma beach. The travel guy at the hotel lined us up for $25/ person to go there. We got transportation to and from, entrance fee, Jetskiis for 30 mins each, and pop and chips all included. When we arrived we paid 2$ each for a conservation fee and went into the most beautiful & isolated beach ever. It was calm enough to snorkel right there and I saw barracuda, angel fish and little white fish and a small group of unknown fish! The waiter walks a 1/4 mile to serve u what u want. If u decide eat there DO! Yum! Have the garlic octopus or the fish tacos!!!! 20$ for two people. That is a super deal and you can go early and spend the whole day there- horsebackridimg and atvs are also available. They have showers there too so bring dry clothes and a towel. This is my fifth time in Mexico so please email me if you like. Oh there is a 30$ snorkel tour -1 hour snorkel about 15 min boatride away. A very profficient guy named Oliver will be your guide.

At the time, it was one of the cheapest all-inclusives in the Riviera Maya. When we arrived, we weren't sure if we were in the right place. The lobby and entrance was small, looked run-down and nobody greeted us. We went to the main desk, and dealt with a pretty miserable man that seemed to only grudgingly help us. When we arrived in our room, we were even more shocked. It was totally dilapidated. Tiles were cracked, old furniture, a bath tub that resembled a trough, chipped paint everywhere. While it seemed clean enough, it was run down. We went down to the beach as soon as we changed, and immediately got a smile on our face. The beach is beautiful. Nice white sand, and it's fairly shallow and goes out a while before getting deeper. The beach saved this place. Service by everyone after our initial bad impressions was very good. Barmen were friendly and attentive, same with waiters. Give these hard working people a tip every once in a while! The food was good, not amazing. A few nights at the buffet had especially good food. The A La Cartes were mostly good, aside from a dish here and there that was mediocre. Another nice aspect is that it's very close to play del carmen. It's within walking distance (about 15 - 20 minute walk, one-way) and you just follow a single street to get there. Entertainment at night was absolutely horrible though. Management needs to take a hard look at that, and rework everything. The shows are absolutely pathetic and need to be thrown out. It was actually offensive at how terrible it was. If they couldn't take some time to plan some shows, why have any at all? Seriously, it made everyone cringe in embarrassment for the staff that had to participate. The onsite \"club\" was gross. It smelled very strongly of mildew and ammonia (I saw them behind the bar washing things using ammonia). And there are resort staff crawling through there trying to take everyone away to CoCo Bongo. It's setup as a trap to sell people on that. It seems they intentionally allow the onsite \"club\" to be so gross that you wouldn't want to stay and dance. Unfortunately for them, the recruitment staff was so annoying and pushy we had no desire to go with them anywhere. Another annoyance was the entertainment during the day. By the pool/beach there is constant, unrelenting rave type music playing only interrupted by a staff member's annoying voice shouting for the relaxing crowd to do various activities with him. It made us and everyone we saw cringe. You literally had to walk down the beach a ways so this annoyance would fade into the background. We were also creeped out by the guy who did the water aerobics. His routine involved getting all the woman to hold hands, and then snakes themselves around until they converged on him. He seemed to really love all the woman pressed up against him. He then instructed the group to bounce up and down in the water. We saw him do this almost every day with these half-intoxicated women. Super creepy. This same guy also liked to invite himself into beach volleyball games that vacationers were playing. He would then begin to hassle everyone around him, telling them they don't know how to play properly and basically just being a jerk. His arrival usually signalled the breakdown of any enjoyable volleyball game. What doesn't make sense is that during the day, they try and turn the place into a rave. At night, it turns into a bizarre episode of telletubbies on the entertainment stage, with nothing for the adults to do. Management really needs to look at this as it's very backwards and can lead to boring nights and frustrating days. Some tweaks to the entertainment staff and how they \"entertain\" would go a long way. Overall, we had fun and really enjoyed the beach. But I would only try this place if it was really cheap and you're OK with having nothing to do at night and like to go to sleep early or trek out to the offsite clubs.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cHeaded downhill\u201d", "Author": "lynWisconsin", "ReviewID": "UR119973636", "Content": "We stayed at the Playacar from Oct. 22-26 when we were moved to their sister resort Xcaret for safety reasons due to hurricane warning.

We stayed here 9 years ago and my has it gone downhill. The rooms are really shabby. Our air condioning did work fine though and it was clean with no bugs. We were on a second floor. The rooms are noisey due to the thatched roofs. Sheets are super thin and they use the plastic mattress protectors which are super hot. We removed and wrote a note until they left them off.

We are not picky but it was not easy finding something you could actually figure out what it was. Breakfast was good with fresh omelets made to order. The pool and beach area is still beautiful but the activity people are basically nonexistant. The nightly entertainment consisted of audience particiapation not any real shows. One of the shows was definately not family orientated as it was rather naughty. They do have a wonderful pair of photographers who do awesome work taking pictures for no fee and they do not pressure you to take them. I was really impressed with the young couple and our daughter decided to have her senior pictures taken there. We got 82 pictures on a CD for a very reasonable price. Had we wanted for a small fee they would have printed actual pics for us. The drinks were very weak and I do not drink much. They also acted at least, as if they didnt know how to make very many different ones. there were no beach waiters and usually a line for drinks with only one bartender on duty. A few times there were two. The location is great as you can walk into town and on the beach forever if you want. I did feel safe and the maids were wonderful.

Food: We were completely surprised by the reviews that complained -- the food was very good, esp the Italian and Mexican restaurants. Reviews that said, \"hot dogs at every meal\" must be eating every meal at the snack bar or something. The bar drinks were great, some of the best we have had in our 8 stays in Cancun (they still use real fruit in their drinks, unlike a lot of big name resorts). Location: Excellent beach location - since they are a small resort, they have a lot more beach per person than other, larger resorts do. We could always find a chair and the beach wasn't packed like the other places. Beautiful beach and ocean. Rooms: This is THE only real problem with this resort - the rooms are very old and in dire need of renovation. We looked at several rooms and finally sprung for the ocean front for an extra $20 a night. The AC barely works, tile missing / cracked in the bathroom, needs paint, etc. If the rooms were renovated, this place would be an incredible deal.

The resort was clean and it was very private unlike some of the busy bigger resort. We are from Canada and maybe our expectations are lower than they should be however we enjoyed ourselves.

Not everyone listens to techno, and when there's no one dancig after 2 hours of listening to the awful stuff and then it gets asked to be changed to ANYTHING else and they STILL won't change the music.

The Hotel was at 100%, and I guess doing something right because they were sending over booked people to their sister resort (Xcaret). After reading all the negative comments I was wondering if the resort that we have been to so many times and loved, had deteriorated so much? What I found was the contrary. The place is as beautiful as always and had the time of our lives. Sure there are some problems mainly with some rooms A.C., but can easily be solved by requesting a room with proper air conditioning. This Resort is rated as a 3.5 stars and for the money (which is about 1/2 of what you'll spend at a 5 star) is well worth it. We have been to other resorts that are larger, better rooms, better food than this one, but not as \"Quaint\" and friendly. The BEACH is probably one of the best in Playa del Carmen. With it's white sandy beach and turcoise waters you can't go wrong. The ROOMS are \"Bungaloo\" 2 story buildings with thatched roofs of 8 units per building, surrounded by beautiful vegetation and palm trees. Each room has a hammock out on your balcony when you want peace and quiet. The main walkway from your room to eigther the restaurant, pools, or beach is a short distance and enjoyable. The GROUNDS are well kept and full of tropical plants. The POOLS (2) one quiet and one with music and activities are great. The ACTIVITY STAFF is always full of fun and surprises and keep people entertained. 3 RESTAURANTS - the main one for breakfast and dinner buffet style(with different theme foods every night). The Italian & the Mexican that you need reservations for (included in your all inclusive, one visit each per stay) are excellent when you feel like getting served off the menu. The restaurant by the pool is for lunch only and is buffett style, good variety. The SHOWS at night (9:30pm kids show, 10pm Adult) are pretty good with different kind of dancers every night (Mexican, Carribean, Las Vegas, etc..). The DISCO/BAR that opens at 9pm every night till 2am is great for a night cap. What we love about this resort is that it's relatively smaller than most at Playacar and get to know people from all over the world. My teenage kids met so many other teens from Spain, Italy, Holland, France, U.S, and Mexico. This is the first time in 12 years of visiting Mexico that we saw so little Americans. I guess the bad press about safety and security are keeping some away. But believe me, they take care of the tourists. They understand where their livelyhood comes from.

I have to admit it was pretty awesome being able to take a casual 10-15 minute walk into Playa Del Carmen instead of having to take a cab. Took a bit longer than that walking on the beach, but the view was nicer than taking the street side. Since it's a gated community, I felt super safe the entire time. My husband and I both did miss the sweet lagoon at the Xcaret hotel, we were only able to get into the water one day out of the 7 due to high winds, so there was no beachfront snorkeling this time, but we made up for that by taking a day trip to Xel Ha. Gorgeous place & we highly recommend it, food & drinks being included in your day pass is fantastic! We also booked another day trip at the hotel, (thank you Juan Pablo Cisneros with Lomas travel!) to Ria Lagartos & Ek Balam. Ria Lagartos is amazing! Our boat guides were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, describing the plants, birds & crocodiles, taking the time to slow down for photo ops. Ek Balam is a treasure! I can now cross off another pyramid that I've climbed! Indescribable architecture. Our tour stopped for dinner in Valladolid...I would love to spend more time in this city! We also took advantage of the bus to Lapis Factory and managed to spend more than we needed to on silver jewelry, again! Playa Del Carmen is definitely fast moving into the tourist zone, I noticed prices were quite a bit higher than even 2 years ago at the restaurants & bars on Fifth Street, so we veered off the beaten path a little to find better prices. As for the hotel itself, it could use some changes. There was ample food at the buffet, though there seemed to be a lack of bacon. Go figure it was the men who noticed this! Otherwise while there was always plenty to choose from, they definitely are attempting to cater to a European clientele instead of maybe sticking to a local diet. I find that unfortunate as when I'm travelling I prefer to eat what the locals do. But that's just me! None of us starved and we also went into town and ate a few times as well. The rooms were cleaned daily, and we always left a tip for the housekeeping. Getting water seemed to be a bit difficult sometimes, but one night my husband was suffering from a bit of sunstroke and when I called the desk they had no trouble getting us extra within moments, so I assumed they were just being frugal with people wasting the bottled water, which makes sense. Fair warning on ground floor rooms though, don't leave food or drinks out, there's little ants that LOVE it! Beds were...hard...'nuff said!

There are numerous all-inclusive hotels lined up inside Playcar along with private homes and at least one golf course.

The meals are very good if repetitive. There is a Mexican and an Italian restaurant that are reservations only that are also good. The reception staff are friendly and helpful.

Very cool and rustic rooms that we loved. One warning- the A/C cannot compete with the heat and moisture at least in July. I had trouble sleeping while sweating so much(No, I'm not overweight, Ok maybe 5 lbs!). The fan helped some but not much.

Our room was ready as soon as we got there so we threw our suitcases in the door of the room and went for dinner. We were pleased with the selection of food on this first night and had no complaints. The beach was amazing the entire time. Now begins my list of issues... 1. Our second night at around 10pm my boyfriend yelled from our washroom to look for some toilet paper, because there was none left in there. Luckily I had some tissues. I called the front desk right away to ask for a maid to bring some to the room. She said their would be there within 15 minutes. We headed to the beach for about an hour, and when we returned there was no toilet paper still. We really wanted to go to bed so I headed to the front desk in person and requested some again. The girl said the maid would be there as soon as possible. Well we had already waited that long, and I asked her if she could just give me a roll, its not gold or anything! She said I either had to grab some from the public washrooms in the lobby for the night or wait. I went into the public washrooms expecting small rolls in there, but no they were huge industrial sized tp rolls. I had it at this point and just walked back to the room, and finally we got a roll at 12:30am. 2. Breakfast was the same soggy pancakes and waffles as well as left overs from lunch/dinner the day before that had been transformed into some weird stuff that did not look good at all. My boyfriend said the omlettes were okay. 3. Lunch lacked creativity. Hamburgers, Hotdogs, Fish and Fries every day. 4. The third day there was a tropical storm so we jumped in the pool to swim in the rain. The lack of the cleaning by the overworked bartender caused all of the cigarette butts on the swim up bar to be washed into the pool! YUCK! 5. I couldn't finish one drink the whole time because each sip was like taking a shot. I requested light alcohol but my requests were ignored. 6. We never tried the restaurants because our friends told us they were a huge dissapointment and they ended up leaving after the second course. 7. We never had a sandwich or fresh guacamole all week. (Website is misleading) 8. We stayed in 2115 by the tennis court and we stayed on the top floor. Our roof had a hole in it so two nights before we left a screaming lizard came in at 4 am, along with an ant infestation. I asked the front desk to do something about it, and they said they would spray the ants.... Never happened though. 9. The pools and beach close at 10pm. So if your going to be up past 10pm, don't bother coming here! We did not expect a great place because of the price we paid, but I expected more than this. I was sick the whole time due to the food, and lack of eating. I actually lost 5 pounds because I was not willing to eat much more than the fruit.

The time spent during the same week in the exact same room was not equivalent. There was a SIGNIFICANT decline in this resort in 1 year. Enough decline in quality that I can say without a doubt that I will not return to this resort of any Occidental property. We arrived early due to our flight and the room was not ready but we did not expect it to be having read Trip Advisor before our review. However, since the hotel arranged our transportation to and from the airport...one would have thought they would be aware we were arriving early!! As guest of a member we were entitled to limited use of the First Club. Due to a mistake of the resort, we were listed as a referral member and therefore forced to go on the 90-minute tour. When I say forced, I mean we received a letter that if we did not go we would be downgraded to a diffferent room and charged more. This wea after a different staff member dismissed us from the tour for the mix up!!! They also called and told us to be sure to bring our ID's and credit cards to the tour.! So we went to the tour and the staff members followed us around for the rest of the week. I.e. - siting by you at lunch, walking outside your room, etc. I did not appreciate that. Had I been close to home, at this point I would have packed up my bags and come home. The food was horrible, very little protein available, and the protein (meat) entrees that were available were cheap cuts (i.e. chicken thighs and wings). During our 2010 visit, the conculsion of the week on Friday night the resort put on an awesome outdoor Mexican fiesta for dinner when asked why that wasn't done this year we were told because they didn't have enough employees. When we questioned the quality of the food, we were told that it was \"off\" season. Folks, the food I feed my dogs is better than the American cheese they had out! During our 2010 visit, every day for lunch the resort grilled hot dogs, hamburgers, fish, pork chops, etc. When asked about the grilling this year we were always told \"maybe tommorow\". Tommorow, never came and after one bite of the hamburgers that were out...I never touched another burger all week. Guacamole is made from a powered avocado it appears...it is not fresh. The room was large with 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms and adequate in space but damp due to the climate. The rooms are in desparate need of renvoation which I understand that the resort is slated to begin soon. The sfaff at this resort is among the hardest working people I have ever encountered in the dining and housekeeping departments. A $5 tip will get you outstanding service all week long! The resort has a fantastic location its ashame they are letting hotel operations ruin the resort. The sand is beautiful (full of red ants though!) and the water is sparkling, crystal blue. The neighborhood (Playacar) is quiet and has security controlled entrances. I never felt unsafe. If you need internet access, go to the Starbucks across the street from the resort and buy a drink for unlimited free internet with A/C!! We took a trip to Cozmuel one day ($13 pp per way) and had a great time renting a Jeep and visiting Coconuts on the back side of the island. Cocounits has the best margaritas (really!!!) and Sangria. The view at Cocounts is amazzing as it sits on top of a cliff overlooking the Carribean sea! Overall a good value but the Wyndham next door is the same price and the facilites are much nicer.

We have been to their Royal Hideaway a year ago. Yes, they are different, but the price is also quite different. Occidental Playacar is on a beautiful beach. Wide beach with plenty of room and turquoise water. There was even a lifeguard on duty on a high platform daily. The people working there are just super nice. They are all polite and no one ignores you. The drinks are fine. If you feel they are too weak, just ask the bartender and they will spike it up for you. Also, try tipping once in a while. They are really amazing people. After the first day, so many were calling me by my first name that I had a hard time believing how they remembered or even found out. Some even knew what you wanted. We are members of the First Club, so we also access to a top of the line selection of drinks. But we did not drink there exclusively. Now, the one complaint that we had was their house wine. It was very so-so. In the Italian restaurant you are able to purchase a bottle of wine from a reasonable selection. No, not hundreds to choose from but I would guess somewhere about 25 or 30. Priced about $20 to $40, it was a reasonable option. You know that you cannot get that cheaper at home. Can you really expect to get a good bottle of wine for $5? If that is your main criterion then you should buy a bottle every night from the Italian restaurant or be at a place that will give you a great bottle daily for free. The food WAS average but, again, consider how much you are paying for everything. It was in no way bad food, just average. Like the price that you paid for the beautiful surroundings, the pleasant and happy atmosphere, the two nice pools, two hammocks (one by each door) that you can swing on, some evening entertainment, and quite a lot of amenities in the resort. I just cannot understand the crab-a__es who complain about things like a lock on the safe that was not working. They probably punched in the wrong combination and the safe would not open. BIG DEAL!! I am just sure that it completely ruined their whole stay. My thought is this. You came to a very nice resort that is located on a gorgeous beach, has a couple of large and very nice pools (one with a swim-up bar), has a couple of specialty restaurants, has wonderful people who service you with a smile, has a massage hut located close to the beach and pool, nice warm water in the sea and pools, etc., etc.,etc. What on earth more do you want? If you want to pay for ONE DAY what you paid for a whole week, and without food or drink yet, and you simply MUST have American food, then stay at home or go to Florida. You will pay maybe ten times more and I wonder what you will find wrong with the set up there. This is not Four Seasons. The price is very affordable. We saw that practically all of the people were enjoying themselves and had a great time. So, loosen up folks, stop looking for the perfection of heaven. We have been at the Occidental Group resorts 4 times already and we will keep going. We really like it. We are from a suburb of Chicago and our vacations are not limited to our home area or only the USA but also a number of countries in Europe, Canada, Islands. So we did not just crawl out from under the rock and were impressed here. All you need to do is to be realistic in your expectations, come with an open mind set to be relaxed and have fun, and leave that \"critics' list\" at home. The bartenders and maids were all so nice.

Most of what was said, good and bad, was true. After arriving at the Cancun airport, we found our shuttle and were off to the hotel in no time. When we arrived at our destination around 1130am, we were told our room would not be ready until 3:00, which we already knew from reading the reviews :) Thankfully, we packed our bathing suits and things in our carry-ons and were ready to go to the beach. The beach was amazing! Gorgeous, clear water and plenty of sunchairs. Water was quite wavy, which was fun and refreshing. Not so safe for those who aren't strong swimmers though. Overall, the beach was wonderful and we spent the majority of our time here. Only complaint: the sand had lots of tiny shells which hurt if you have sensitive feet and walk barefoot. No biggie, just wear your flip flops if that's the case. After spending a bit at the beach, we headed to the snack bar for lunch. The food....also not so great. However, if you are used to all-inclusive resorts that are on the cheaper side, it's nothing you haven't seen before. Nachos, hot dogs, burgers, salads, etc. Not so bad. And the beer and drinks were great! We finally arrived at our room around 330. The room was nothing special. At all. Actually, quite dissapointing. The bed was hard as a rock and the linens were damp from the air conditioning (that didn't seem to work at all.) Small, smelly bathroom, and a broken safe. Not a great first impression. We stuck with it for the first day though, because how much time do you really spend in your room? We did ask to be moved to a new room the following day, which the hotel accomadated no problem. The second room wasn't much of an improvement, but it was better than the first being on the second floor and having a nicer view. Best part of the rooms: the hammocks :) awesome for an afternoon nap, or for reading on the deck, whatever you like. It was fantastic. The food at all of the restaurants was mediocre...not great but not the worst I've had! I could always find something to eat. I would definitely reccommend going into Playa del Carmen and walking along the streets, there are tons of restaurants to choose from with amazing food! Definitely worth the 5 dollar cab ride. Nightlife at the hotel was pretty lame, but there were plenty of bars in town. Overall, we had a great trip, very relaxing and much-needed.

Located about an hour drive from the Cancun airport. The drivers there are terrible but we DID get there quick! We arrived around 11:30am and as expected the room wasnt ready until 3. Check in was fast and easy,our bags were left with an attendant (we carried around a smaller bag with valuables) while we explored the beach/pool and had some lunch. Asked for the status of our room at 1:30pm and we got room 3415, perfect location. The higher the room number the closer you are to the beach. We had a top floor room with a king size bed and a thatched roof. We could hear EVERYTHING from our neighbours. The birds also give you an early wake up call, but overall it was a nice change from the standard hotel chain room. Turned the A/C on the first day and it didnt feel cold until our 5th day, i assume because of the roof. The room needed a major cosmetic repair because although it may be cleaned it still looks dirty. Beds are very hard (concrete boxsprings with one of those egg carton-foam topper things). This was concerning because since the room wasnt cold - I can only imagine the sweat saturated into it! Food wasnt the best. We enjoyed the Mexican restaurant, the beef chimichanga was the only thing I ate all week that had flavour. The coffee was good, wine was terrible. You need to ask the omelette lady for bacon during breakfast as its not left out. We had to flag down servers for water/coffee most of the time...sometimes i served myself at their station. Everything had hotdogs on it (hot dog pizza, hot dog soup, etc) The beach is beautiful, we loved the rough water but be careful of sharp shells. The water was not suitable for small kids/poor swimmers. Take advantage of the 10 min free massage. I think they have less staff on sundays. They closed the swim up bar and shut down the burger/hot dog hut. Not a huge deal - we never waited more than 2 mins for a drink at the pool bar. Drinks were good. We tipped at the end of the week to those who gave us good service. Jacobo was the only server who offered to bring us drinks by the pool. The nightly entertainment was cheesy but the kids show was fun to watch. After the show ends there is nothing to do, nobody uses their disco. Go into town to party, coco bongo is a show you need to see at least once. Take a $7 cab into town and you can catch the game on TV, go to bars, shop..you can also walk the beach but its at least 30 mins and it was too hot for us. There is also a small plaza 5 mins away if you walk left from the resort. I heard the excursions are cheaper there. We booked with Juan at the resort and would recommend him (Jungle Maya Tour was AWESOME if you like a physical adventure). Bring an alarm clock for the room and cheap watches for the beach. We didnt bring any and had a hard time keeping track of the time for restaurant reservations/excursions. The wake up call didnt make any sound just a blinking light on the phone. We were disappointed there wasnt a gym on site, get creative for exercise. The pool activities were never as scheduled Overall - its a small, clean, quiet resort.

Although Allegro is a 3 star resort, it was very satisfactory. Allegro is a smaller resort with beautiful grounds, which makes you feel like you are living in a beautiful, lush garden. The thatched guesthouses have 4 units down and 4 units up, and each unit has a small patio with a hammock. I often saw other guests relaxing on their patio having evening drinks or enjoying a stretch on the hammock escaping the midday heat. It was relaxing to lie in the hammock reading, watching the birds and other small animals or the hotel staff grooming the grounds. The pools were always clean and gave a beautiful view over the beach. Although a number of people reserved their chairs with towels, it was not a problem to get a beach chair, or to find a place to sit to have lunch from the bar, which is in the pool area. Staff was really terrific at the Allegro. Front desk staff was cheerful and very helpful with questions and with advising about tours and any other needs. The cafeteria was a treat in the morning, as singing waiters moved efficiently and so cheerfully from table to table offering coffee and other needs. Humberto and Luis!!! Their cheerful singing and buoyant moods were infectious! The other restaurants, Italian and Mexican required pre-booking, which is best done on the day you arrive, as they are very popular. The Italian is very elegant, exquisite food and wonderful service. The Mexican is also a treat, with fine service and a good atmosphere. Tours arranged by the guest services staff were good. We booked for a \u00bd day snorkeling trip and had the luck to have a tour guide called Issey, short for Isreal. A wonderful, helpful, knowledgeable man who brought us on a Mayan adventure snorkeling tour in 3 spots: Yal-Ku Lagoon \u2013 a very enjoyable swim up to a fish filled reef; a cenote \u2013 an underground lagoon with crystal clear water, stalagmites and stalactites; and a lagoon where we enjoyed racing along a zip line and dropping into the water, and jumping off a high edge into the clear pool of water. We also enjoyed a scuba diving trip arranged at a poolside kiosk at the hotel. This was convenient, as our competence was thoroughly checked out by a PADA certified diver in the Allegro swimming pool, and we later left for the diving trip from their headquarters, the PADA diving centre, about 5 minutes walk down the beach. It was a wonderful outing with 4 or less divers per dive instructor. We had one dive instructor for my daughter and me, and we were treated to swimming amongst hundreds of beautiful fish on a very interesting reef. A great dive, and well worth it. Along with my many very wonderful memories of a great trip, is my appreciation for what I think of is helpfulness beyond what I expected. On arriving home from my trip I found that I had left behind in my hotel room a beautiful, new leather jacket. I contacted the front desk at Allegro. Yvonne persisted in locating it from security, and Myra, who works for guest services, then took on the responsibility of arranging to identify it for me and arrange to have it sent home to me. Myra sent me photographs to ensure she had found the right jacket, she arranged Fedex to send the jacket, and she e-mailed me many times to see that I knew how things were progressing. I was so grateful that Allegro staff had gone to the trouble to help me even though I was no longer their guest! I insisted on sending a reward for their trouble and for my gratefulness, but Myra would not hear of it! All I can say is: \u201cThank you for a wonderful week in Mexico, with only wonderful, positive memories!

The rooms were very clean, there was a lot to choose from for the meals that were offered. The main buffet area was kept clean, it was sometimes full and they would open up a separate area so there would be more tables. They would run out of glasses and plates periodically, but they were quick in getting more out on the floor. The location on the beach was ideal, there was a lot of sea shells in the sand that people complained about, but we were on a beach. Our room was very clean, but it did need some updating, and the bed was a mattress on a slab of concrete, something that you get used to after a couple of nights. Entertainment needs more work, they tried their best, but it did lack a few things. The pool area was great and the lunch buffet always had something to satisfy us. The bbq buffet was next to the pool and it provided burgers, hotdogs, fries and fish from the grill. The employees of the resort were very friendly and daytime entertainment provided a little fun for everyone. Being so close to town was great, a 30 minute walk up the beach and you were there if you wanted to do any shopping. In the nightime, we would walk to the square which took less than 5 minutes. Starbucks gave us free access to the internet with a purchase and shoppng was ok in the square. Our location on the resort was right next to the pool area, which was also just a few steps to the beach, which we were pleased with. Quite beautiful site looking onto the beach but it was always windy, but it was pleasant where it was so hot. For people who like the ease of getting around, this is a small resort, I believe about 260 rooms, so it didn't take long to get around.

I was pleasantly suprised. The ride from Cancun can be about an hour. Relax and look at the country as you head to your destination. Alto obviously does not mean sto to the drivers...it was great!! Riveria Maya is being built up so it looks a bit rougher at first but just hold on!! It does not appear to be as big of a party town as Cancun and I really liked that plus it was the start of off season. The reviews about the room are correct. The hotel is in need of repair and the air conditioner in our room wasnt the greratest. The sewer smell was easily fixed by wetting a smaller towel and placing over both drain holes in the bathroom and by the sink. If you keep the door closed it reduses the smell and keeps he room cooler. I also brought bathroom spray. You are supposed to put toilet paper in the trash, the entire country is like this....dont complain, be careful if you do flush it and call maintance if you screw it up...your not in a rich country so they have som old technology that they are working with. The towels are large and always enough. The wateris not hot like you might be use to. Look on the roof, the black barrel catches the water and the sun heats it up, they have no hotwater heaters, the showers were great and you dont need the hot water anyways. The bed is on a slab of concrete and the mattress is firm but comfortable and did not cause me a problem. I mean really, my objectie was only to sleep here for maybe 7 hours and clean off then head out so the room was not amazing but i HAVE HAD WORSE AT A COMFORT IN Or Econolodge. The maid did a great job everyday. The bufets were average but always enough food and it was dishes I have not seen but the names are above the station. The bar was nice and the drinks were fine. The beach is amazing and great location. The sand is not powder and you have to be careful of the shells, but I loved that part. I picked up so many shells and had a wonderful time, wear swim shoes if you have sensitive feet but this is a real beach!!! The flags were yellow and red but it is the SEA and undertows can be expected but I was in the water everyday!!! The staff is amazing and wonderful. They get to know you personally and give good advice when you venture out of the resort!! Time share tour took 5 hours....dont go unless you really want to buy!! The animal that looks like a rodent is cute to watch and the geckos and iguanas are everywhere!! I worshiped the sun so by nightlife I was asleep. I did make 2 shows, they are like little theatre productions so dont expect the Lion King play, but the staff works hard and it shows. Shopping on 5th ave. is great it was 70 pesos to get there but we were able to barter to 50 pesos to get back. BE minful of when the cruise lines come into the shopping area as the prices go up. The prices are also cheaper after 1pm. Remember, these people are trying to make a living, you are trying to make a great deal, they will come down on prices and may push you for a price, there are many streets with the same product so move on. Beware, there is a very cute little girl with a gecko on a string..she likes to throw it on you and smile. She also wants to play with you. She is darling!!! WE drank the filtered water at the resort the entire time with no problems. I had an amazing trip that was within my small budget. I could not have had this vacation had I not been at the Allegro, its not fancy and dosnt have all the thrills but it was affordable and comfy. The free watrs sports are only for one hour a day and you have to have a $20 deposit, they give back to you if you return it in an hour. There are people that sell stuff on the beach, just like the market name your price. They are few that come, nothing like in Cancun. There is a lady that brids hair, I did it and had no worries about my hair until the last day and then had my friend take them out. Beware, having the braided hair makes you a target for people to try and sell you stulff! Lamos did our excersion and it was painless. Have a great time and really...I would return to this place in the future as I said before, I am there to be comfortable, I do not need to be waited on hand and foot and have all the ammenities, I went for the beach and surf!!!!", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFor the price we paid, the Allegro was great!\u201d", "Author": "DBcooks", "ReviewID": "UR106900701", "Content": "My friend and I just returned from our wonderful trip and found the Allegro a lovely resort.

We have found that most resorts close their pools down when it gets dark outside. The room was pretty funky looking with a thatched roof and we even had a couple of doves nesting above our patio. Lovely bird sounds to wake up to. The only downside is some of the room locations. Ours happened to be right near the nightly entertainment so whether you wanted to watch it or not you heard it. We dealt with it fine as we stayed up later but it would be a tough location especially for those with young children.

I find these trip reviews from fellow travellers very helpful , especially ones that contain tips on things to bring , and sites to see. Even the nay-sayers have helped, This was our 4th trip to Mexico , but 1st with our teenage daughters , along with 6 other extended family members.. Bus ride from the airport took much longer than what we were told ..i.e. approx 1 hr . We were on the bus for 45 min before it even left the airport! The ride in was uneventful and dead SLOW ! Speed limit 100 kph ...the driver never went above 70 the whole way. I'm no speed demon, but we had just spent 6 hrs on a flight and wanted to get to the resort ASAP. We had to make two stops along the way to drop off passengers at other resorts. In total it was +3 hrs from luggage pick up to our drop off at the resort --- the airport transfer is included , but I RECOMMEND you skip the bus , and take a taxi ...you'll get to the resort in 45 mins tops! Check in was painless. Staff were efficient and friendly . Rooms were ready. Only questionable transaction was the room safe rental rate of $2 USD/day .When we got to the room, the safe just req'd to be coded with your access code and you had a safe place to store your passports and valuables. I'm thinking we would have had use of this safe even if we didn't pay . $14 not a big to do , but its the principle of the thing - why charge us if we really never had to pay. Our daughters had a safe in their room - which we didn't rent, b/c we didn't need 2 - but just to see if it would work ..we set up theirs as well and could have used it ...@ no charge . Go figure ! Special requests ...A few days prior to leaving home, I tracked down the Allegro reservations line and called the resort to request adjoining rooms for ourselves and our daughters, pleasantly surprised that we got them upon arrival. We were on the ground floor of Bldg 55 , excellent location close to the main pool and beach . The rest of our group were next door . from previous posters I came prepared for the rooms' shortcomings ... I brought along extra hangers, a box of tissues, some rolls of TP, air fresheners, our own beach towels, facecloths, alarm clock, and an extension cord. .Bathroom has an outlet for the hairdryer, and there's another one in the shelf in the closet. Beds were hard ...took some getting used to , even with the foam toppers . Our bathroom was fine, great water pressure, lots of hot water, but they recommend you put the TP in the garbage bin. Not what most of us are used to doing at home.. if you don't ..it gets easily clogged ...just letting you know:-) A/C worked fine, and the ceiling fan kept the room nice and cool at night. No issues with noise ..place pretty much died in that area of the resort once the bar closed. Rooms were cleaned by cleaning-OC maids ... they really took their time and did an excellent job,. We left a tip every day . Our girls looked fwd to the seeing what towel art was left on our beds each day. Mini bar was always restocked with bottled water, the resort info you're given at check-in said there's supposed to be choc bars and chips in there as well ...purely a myth .. only treats in our fridge were the ones we brought from home. As mentioned in just about every other review ..this place could use some TLC ... it's showing its 27 yr old age ... missing railing on the ramp up to the buffet restaurant. Chipped concrete on some 2nd storey balconies ..floor tiles in the rooms were laid by the mayans . But overall, we knew we weren't going to a five star ... short staffed bar , lack of resort amenities , the much needed repairs , chipped/peeling paint on the bldgs .. it is a 2.5- 3 * .... at best. Food was okay - booked both a la cartes as soon as we checked in . Recommend that you get that done as soon as you can. The Mexican was great - best main course was the shrimp . We booked the Italian , but unfortunately never made it back from an excursion on time ..and lost of reservation :-( The breakfast was the best meal of the day at the buffet. Great omelette station , bacon was a rare find ..and not that great. Replenishment of condiments (pancake syrup, honey etc) was slow. Lots of mornings we had to wait on juice glasses . Waiters/ Servers worked hard, but just weren't enough of them . Plenty of fresh fruits , yogourt, and asst'd breads/rolls/pastries. Cold or hot cereal / choc milk /cold cuts / cheeses . Pretty much anything to please even the pickiest of eaters. Dinner at the buffet was somewhat of a hit or a miss. One night I walked around the various stations and nothing appealed to me, I just gave up and had ice cream . The pasta station could use better heating elements .. it was always cold and the sauces were room temp at best . Unidentifiable dishes were everywhere , surmised that these were most likely leftovers from prior meals ..I've never seen so many dishes made with leftover / half cooked potatoes ! Dessert selection reminded me of the dining hall when I was at university . Bland , mass produced gelatin like impersonators of what should have been cheesecake and fudge brownies . The best part ..like other reviewers ...we loved the grounds and the beach.. Throw your towel on a chair early to reserve an umbrella ..they go fast. Mixed drinks were weak ..wine was vinegar-like , the only true tasting beverage was the Coroner on tap. BUT if you tipped ..you got Bacardi and not some Mexican watered down version. Bar staff ,,busy / hard working / friendly folks, but they needed extra help behind the bar during the peak afternoon hours. Always a line for drinks, or waiting on glasses by the pepsi dispenser. Swim up bar .. never got close to it as it was constantly under seige by a group of loud ,obnoxious, rude , drunk and disorderly , ashamed to same, fellow countrymen. I'm all for someone having a good time ..but when you get so drunk that you run the risk of hitting your head as you somersault into the shallow end ...security really should have been keeping a better eye on these guys. At one point one of them verbally attacked an older lady. The vulgarity and obscenties he hurled were grounds for removing him from the resort . Families with small children witnessed this . It was not very pleasant. Security really needs to do a better job to deal with unacceptable behavior and unsafe situations ...people too drunk to walk should not be allowed in the pool. Nolitours rep ...not very helpful ...prime objective was to sell tours (which more more expensive than the competition) and make higher commission . We expected info on the resorts facilties .We booked a Coba Tour with a rep at the Playa Plaza (long story ...I do not recommend using them ..they were called Adventour ..a guy named Leonardo sold it to us . ) We did all the things they promised, and then some .... trust me book elsewhere. We booked our 2nd with Barrakuda (on the resort site - next to where you get the towels) . All day Catamaran trip , with snorkelling and parasailing. A nice day with no surprises . Short walk to the Playa Plaza (5 mins to the left of the resort front lobby) will get Starbucks and free WiFi . the girls took the iPods and got online no problem to get in touch with their friends back home. Buy a phone card at the Plaza USD $10 for 30 mins . Phone calls from your room, even using a calling card will be outrageously expensive ! Overall the trip was fine ... we've been on better resorts, for the same price as we paid for this one . Love the Mayan Riviera area ... will go back again , but next time will do my research .

Had to turn it off at night to try and sleep. Beds are a thin single mattress over a slab of concrete. Beds are made of concrete. When we checked in, only had one room in the light that worked. The rest were taped together with black electrical tape. The safe I rented in the room broke twice and each time had to wait an hour each time for the security guard to come and reset it. Our villa room door had to be finally repaired. Before that, we had to have our key cards replaced three times. Had flying cockroaches in our room that were bigger than the gekkos that were crawling over the walls. We also had tiny bugs that crawled over the bedding. I was assured by Guest Services that they would not bite. Like that would comfort me! We finally got moved to another room near the beach. This was one only had the small bugs. But the bathroom smelled like sewer and vomit mixed together. I was told to go to Guest Services and tell them all of our complaints and maybe I would be compensated but I didnt get anything. The food was so-so. My child ended up in hospital with a stomach infection due to the food and was severly dehydrated. Oh, and if you happen to have to go to the hospital, if they say, they may need to move you from ER to upstairs and that the cost will not change, they are lying. Insist you stay there and if not, check yourself out. They will keep you and run tests that are probably not necessary also prescribe alot of medications that are also not really necessary. The hospital care was excellent, don't get me wrong. Getting back to the Resort, the service at the Buffett, could be better. There were days, that you order a drink, and you would never get it or you'd have to run around and find a mug, cutlery to set a placement yourself. They dont have enough people working there to accomodate the number of guests. I think there were 4 people altogether. The plaza with Starbucks that has free internet service is only a 4 min walk away. We always felt safe, no question about that. You can walk to Playa del Carmen in 30 minutes or take a cab. Good shopping there as well. The night life on the resort is non existent. They had a very small disco bar, that was empty most nights. Some nights it was closed. Their shows they put on for the guests were okay. Nothing spectacular. I would go back to Playa del Carmen yes, but not to this resort. Finally, I heard the beach was beautiful here, but I have to disagree on this too. The beach was full of sharp bits of coral everywhere.. you needed your shoes on to walk on the beach. We only went out on the beach once. Ive seen better beaches in Cuba and Florida. And the water was always rough. If the red flag wasnt up then it was the yellow. Always very windy. Take a sun block that is 60 or more and get a prescription to avoid \"traveller's trots\" from your doctor before you go. Ive been home two days now and myself and my child are still suffering. Guaranteed you will get them unless you have a great tolerance to the food there. And dont drink too many drinks with salt or lemon and lime. It can react with the sun and give your mouth and other parts of your face and neck, some pretty mean blisters- which I got. The only good thing I could say about this resort, was the grounds are beautiful, plenty of pool chairs around, and the pool bar was good as well as the snack bars burgers.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, California", "Title": "\u201cSun Worshipers Paradise\u201d", "Author": "bavaldez6", "ReviewID": "UR105509007", "Content": "WOW!!!! We just returned from a FABOLOUS vacation! If you are considering a trip to Playa Del Carmen anytime soon, I hope you take the time to read my review...Please note, we did our homework before booking our trip with this hotel and knew exactly what we were expecting to get... Upon arrival, we were informed that our hotel was over-booked and that they would be up-grading us for the night to their 5-Star sister hotel \"Xcaret Occidental\". This hotel was very beautiful but extemely large. It accomodates a very large number of people -The place is so big, you have to take a tram down to their so-called beach, which was actually a man-made cove. There was also no view of the beautiful ocean that Playa Del Carmen is known for. The following morning we returned back to the Allegro Playacar and met with the Property Manager \"Miguel\", who quickly got us checked in to our hotel and took EXCELLENT care of us throughout our entire stay. Although our rooms were not quite ready, our luggage was kept safely in the lobby while we were able to go play at the beach and pool and officially start our vacation. The beach is absolutely beautiful, one of the finest beaches we've seen yet!! We also enjoyed relaxing at the pool while enjoying the view of the ocean. Later on that afternoon, we went to check out our rooms which were a little smaller then what we are used to -but very CLEAN, close to the ocean and pools which made it more enjoyable and most importantly -we knew we had chosen the right place!!! By nights end, the resort staff had made a point to get to know each of us by name, which made it a very personable experience. The Entertainment Staff is AWESOME and is continously providing all sorts of entertainment to all guests and plays great music by the pool. I just can't say enough about the Servers (Alex, Jacob and Manuel) whom we met down by the pool area and disovered worked the morning buffett as well. These guys are very hard workers, always referred to us by name, very eager to please and they ALWAYS, ALWAYS have a smile on their face.They provided us with plenty of laughs and our drinks never went dry! The food in the Buffet was good -a little something for everyone! The (2) restaurants were great I especially liked The Italian and the staff was AWESOME!!! We went to the nightly entertainment shows and appreciated all the hard work it takes to put such a production on. Great dancers, great music, great entertainment. The grounds are very CLEAN and kept up nicely.

The negative reviews were very inflated and completely inaccurate. We arrived very late at night and were greeted by very enthusiastic clerks at the front desk. Check in was quick and we headed to our room. We were on the top floor of a small hut like cabin. It was very private with a hammock and table. The rooms were really small and older but we didn't expect it to be a 5*, because we paid for a 3.5*. There were no bugs in the room and the rooms were clean. The maids did a fabulous job at ensuring the rooms were clean daily. You are not there to spend your time in the rooms so the 20 or so channels are fine and many are in English. The beds were hard but definitely comfortable! I haven't slept better in my life. Quiet and comfy. The staff greeted us daily with smiles and were always pleasant to deal with. We met Eduardo, the conceirge for the Spa, and he remembered my name even after a quick discussion on the first day. The entertainment at the pool was great. Antonio was very funny and always had a smile on his face. We enjoyed watching him doing daily aerobics in the pool with the ladies. The pool bar needed upgrading as it appeared dirty with missing tiles. It wasn't always equipted with a bartender which meant you needed to leave the pool to get a drink. In the afternoons, there was only one bartender at the bar, which did meant longer line ups. Because it was a small resort, lines were relatively small. Don't expect to be delivered drinks on the beach as this doesn't seem to be a speciality for them. The night time entertainment was fine. If you are looking for a night club atmosphere, you may be disappointed. Very few people stayed around after the show to use the night club. The shows were fine, but to be honest, I went to bed early most evenings. The service was great. We especially liked Jacobo. He was so accommodating and very personable. He worked at the breakfast buffet and later at the pool as a waiter. He was so good. You will enjoy him! The food was awesome. Something for everyone. We decided to got the Italian restaurant for both of our a la carte dinners and were not disappointed. The service, and food, were unbelievable! The pasta was wonderful, and the wine was delicious. We went to 5th Ave 3 evenings. We liked going at night because it was cooler. They served tequilla in alot of the shops and you could buy/ drink beer while you shopped. You could buy local beer anywhere from $1 to $5. Be careful not to get sucked into prices as they start really high. You can buy hammocks for $20 (they start at $60 at most places) and some cheap jewellery. It is about a 15 minute walk from the beach or 70 pesos by taxi. I went parasailing with my husband and enjoyed it. The Nolitours rep suggested we book through them as it would be higher standards but the one on the beach looked just as safe. We also went to Rio Secreto. It was fun but certainly not for anyone with back or leg problems. My brother in law and I had massages on the beach. It was amazing to be in the heat with a cool breeze. It was an experience I will not forget! The beach was awesome. The waves were big, the water was warm and the water was clear as could be. I am so glad we were at a resort on the beach. Internet was horrible. It was broken 2 or 3 days that we were there. They only had 1 computer, which was slow most of the days. It cost 20 pesos for 10 minutes.

We like it that way as you get to know other guests and the staff. We where ready for the older resort ,we found so was not disappointed. We arrived at 11:45 a.m to the hotel. Told right away ,rooms not ready until 3.pm. We had packed a bathing-suit in our carry ons and a few other articles as we realised we would not get room right away. We changed in washroom. They put our suitcases in a locked room. If we had not inquired where to put luggage it would have sat outside front door as I noticed another guests did. No attempt to help with luggage. We did go back a few times and asked if room was ready yet but told no. Yes desk clerks where not the friendlest. Our first room smelt damp and stinky. It was near the stage. I complained and they said could not change until next day and yet I saw other guests arriving who did not have a room yet and got one. We where comfortable that night,slept well and decided oh well we`ll stay as we are not in room much. We went for breakfast,came back there was a large puddle in middle of bed plus on the head of bed. It rained that a.m very hard after we got up. I went over to desk and complained. They had another room.,strange as it was all made up in the a.m .Where was that room the evening before. . While we gathered our belongings up. A young housekeeper came in ,stripped the bed. He put clean linen right over the wet mattress. Guess that`s why the room smelt damp. Now for some possitive. We got a nice room closer to beach...loved it! even if we had to be quiet as we where on top floor. Pool was lovely and you could sit there and see the beach. Close to the great beach buffet.It was there fr. 11 to approx 4p.m Bar drinks where good. We had our own cooler bottles so kept drinks cold and got a larger drink. We walked into town on the street ,lovely homes and then back on the beach. We enjoyed the beach but,water was much too ruff to snorkel out from shore. We went on two excursions. One to Tulum..very interesting but Guide talked way too much on bus going and there. Guess we could have looked around by ourselves. They took us to this huge Jewllery place. They must have had 75 or more employees trying to sell you something. I was not impressed even if they where wanting to make a living. We went snorkling with the sea turtles , that was good. My favourite was snorkling in the fresh water underground river the Cenote. Ruff jeep ride in and out of there but worth it. Back at resort their entertainment staff was great. Always had something going on. Entertainment was very good at night. We ate mostly at buffet. Not the greatest desserts but guess who needs them . We went to the Italian,food wonderful and great service as usual. Staff wonderful,happy and obliging at this resort. We didn`t go to the Mexican. If you want to go to the alecart restaurants you have to reserve at the desk a day or so ahead. Night life is quiet but by that time we are ready for day to end. Quiet drink at pool bar until 10 p.m or upstairs at main bulding until late. The younger people go into town in evening to the different bars. Seemed to have a great time ,we where told.

Nice hammocks for each room. Great staff everywhere except for front desk and management. Now the bad. The walls are paper thin. If you have nice quiet family types and couples next door (most of the people in the resort), this is no problem. If you have, as we did, drunken morons who fight at 2 am before having noisy sex....you will get no sleep. If you read that they have 3 restaruants and think you are going to have some variety...think again. The reservations for the sit down restaurants appear to be non-existant though the restaurants are empty. Be prepared for buffet. The big problem with this resort, though, is management. As noted in other reviews, this group overbooks this hotel to the extreme. We had 2 rooms...one for our family which was arriving after 2 of us spent the first 2 days there. We showe up at 2:30 to get the room and were told we couldn't check in until 3 pm. O.k. rules are rules. At 3, we waited in line to get our room. At 3:30 we were told the hotel was overbooked and they would move us to the RIU Yucatan but it would be awhile before they could take care of it. The other hotel, while a higher * hotel is nothing like what we were wanting...big, noisy, package tourist hotel to the extreme. We wasted the afternoon moving. This practice of overbooking the hotel is apprently an epidemic with this outfit if you read the other reviews. This type of practice is clearly illegal and should be stopped. After telling you that they don't have a room for you, they give you a release to sign releasing them from legal responsibility for providing you an alternative.

Our air-conditioning was extremely loud with weird pop-corn popping sounds, but we just turned it off at night and put on the ceiling fan. The temperature was fine. The beds are a bit firm like most in Mexico, but these were pretty good. The food was good - not awesome - but good and there was always something for everyone (even our picky youngest 6 year old). There seemed to be a bit of a shortage of tables. We had to get our drinks, go find a table, then \"claim it\" with our drinks, or we'd have no place to sit. Not many spoons to be found either.... Someone else said they weren't warned about expensive phone calls by the Nolitours reps - be we were. Perhaps they misunderstood, but we've been to Mexico before and have been surprised by the huge bills before. The kids club was really nice - made our 6 year olds visit. She loved it there and didn't even WANT to be with us. They did lots of crafts, nice play ground, went to the beach, played games, watched some TV (in Spanish mostly, but some English), etc. etc. - Janette there was wonderful. The activities people were really enthusiastic and did some exercising and games. There is no gym at this hotel, which we missed. There is no dive shop at this hotel, but 1 hotel away is the Barrakuda (that's how they spell it) dive shop. They were top notch. We had Hugo as our dive master for 4 dives. He taught our boys the resort course and took them for their first 30 foot dive. They pick you up right in front of the hotel, so you don't need to take a taxi anywhere. They had lots of gear to use and reasonable prices. We highly recommend them. The photos offered at the end are not the best qualtiy for 50$ for a dvd, but we got them as it was our boys' first dives. It was mostly around 30 C while we stayed, but there was always a steady breeze, so we always felt comfortable. There seemed to be enough chairs for us - not lots, but enough. The hotel never ran out of towels either which is nice. Feel free to trust the Lomas travel rep located at the hotel.

The best motto is, \"you get what you put in\". We initially decided to stay at this resort because it was a bit cheaper (appx 1000.00 CAD) so that we would be able to have some extra money for excursions, shopping, etc. Overall, we stayed here for the price and the location. The location was perfect for walking into Playa del Carmen, and for its close proximity to tourist sites such as Tulum etc. The beach front was amazing as well (you can walk on the beach into Playa del Carmen). Now, the negatives. The food at this hotel was terrible. Breakfast was the best! If you are a wine connoisseur, bring your own. The \"house\" was also horrible. There are only two a la carte restaurants. The Italian was okay. We did not attempt the Mexican one. Other drinks - general slushy drinks and corona. Tip well and you will get Bacardi instead of local rum. The resort was generally clean and the house keeping employees were very approachable and nice. We left a few dollars every day for a tip which was well received. Rooms - try to get a room on the first floor. If you have a room on the second floor you will be able to hear everything your neighours are doing - especially when they get down and dirty. Try to get rooms close to the beach (they are better and you get nicer towls!). Beds are relatively comfortable and you are able to sleep. Don't expect anything spectacular. The rooms are plain. Service - service at the front desk was slow (as expected) but don't think you will get and answer from various front desk employees if you want them. If you want a room change it will take you three days and no one ever knows. We actually had an experience where some at the front desk gave our room keys to a couple that had just arrived at the resort. They accidently entered our room at 1:00am while we were sleeping. When I called the front desk to discuss the mishap, the man spoke to me in a very rood manner and then hung up. We made a formal complain to the director of the hotel. Don't run into that guy - he's rude and need a crash course from McDonalds in customer service. Entrainment crew was excellent. You have to watch the classic musician show. Hilarious. Juan was also great. He will show you around downtown if you want to party and is very approachable. He will also teach you salsa. The afternoon games were also quite fun.

Second time in an Occidental Hotel and resort and once again, we weren't disappointed!! Don't expect a 4 and a half or 5 stars; it's a good 3 and a half, 4 at my point of vue! PERFECT for a good vacation at an accessible price! The hotel and resort is VERY clean, nice gardens, well maintained, it's a beautiful site! The buffet restaurant is at the second floor of the lobby, as so is the Italian \"\u00e0 la carte\" restaurant; everything is central. 2 pools: one to relax and one with activities; just big enough to cool down and have fun! Between them, the buffet for lunch, the pool bar, the Mexican \"\u00e0 la carte restaurant\", the pizza restaurant and the gourmet cafe! Very nice resort!!!! The beach: WOW!!! Thought Varadero (Cuba) and Punta Cana were gorgeous, but this beach is very, very beautiful: Carribean Sea, white sand, you can walk on both sides for hours!!!! Also, by the beach, you can easily reach Playa Del Carmen in about a 20 minutes walk... that's pretty cool! The only thing I kinda disliked about the beach is that people put their cigarettes in the sand (a bit disgusting) and there's lots of seashells, so wath where you step!!! More palm trees or palapas to hide from the burning sun would also be a point to upgrade! But for us, that's a detail!

The rooms: big enough, but VERY humid... even with the air conditioned on!

I did my research before I got there so I knew what to expect. It was everything I expected but it was so much more. Yes our room was rustic and small, but everything worked and it was very clean. The maid service was great. A new towel animal on our bed everyday. The staff were amazing and very helpful never a rude moment from any of them. The beach, well it has to be one of the best in the world. The staff would make sure the deck chairs were in place and the sand raked for the morning rush of beach goers. The grounds are keep very neat and tidy and the grounds staff were always keeping busy with trimming bushes and cutting the grass. There are some funny animals who live there like the half rabbit and rat, the long tailed looking raccoon and yes the lizard family. There are three cats, my favorite was the little orange one he has a funny face but so friendly. The buffet was good lots of variety, we enjoyed it. Never got to go to the al la carte kept forgetting to reserve. You can also purchase a romantic dinner on the beach. The massages are really good, best ones I have ever had, yes they cost a little extra as well, but well worth it. The bartenders are friendly and they will even come to the beach to take your order. The pools were a bit cool, not to many people ventured in there but the deck chairs around the pools were always full. Lots of deck chairs at the beach but best to get them early for a good spot under a palapa or the yellow canvass shelters. If you go there expecting a 5 star, please stay away, but if you expect a 3.5 star then that is where you want to be. Allegro is so close to everything. Remember it is one of the first resorts in Playacar. It is about 27 years old. I hear they are going to renovate this fall. I would go back here a gain, it was a great place to stay. The entertainment was not that classy, we have seen better before at other resorts but they try. Say hi to Jorge in the little shop on the way to the beach, my husband and him became good friends.

I can honestly say while my experience with vacationing at all inclusive resorts is limited, I have traveled and stayed at places on both a higher ended budget as well as a low end budget and felt this resort hit the mark when came to an overall value for your dollar. It seems as though the whole 3, 4 and 5 star ratings are pretty varied in Mexico and while you would not put this in a 5 star category I would definitely consider this to be very close to a 4 star resort as far as quality goes. The food for the most part was pretty typical as far as buffet goes...fruit was always nice and fresh and plentiful as well as the salads. Each evening there is a different theme at the buffet and the fish entrees consistently seemed to be the best tasting dish. Sure it gets a little boring after 5 days of being there but there were plenty of options to mix it up everyday. My only complaint was that there were only the two a la carte restaurants to dine at, and if you don't make reservations the first night you get there good luck trying to get a dinner reservation the rest of the week. We only ate at the Mexican al a carte the one night and the food and service was excellent! The bar staff were friendly and always very appreciative of any gratuities you would throw their way. $1 for a round of drinks goes a long way, and for those who complain that the drinks were weak all you have to do is ask for a little more alcohol in your drink and they will gladly top you up! Rooms were kept very clean and the housekeeping staff was excellent and very friendly. Beds are a little firm but I believe that is the norm there. Air conditioning and fan worked great we slept no problem. We personally loved the bamboo thatched units, and the fact the each room had its own little patio with table, chairs and a hammock. The size of the resort was a nice advantage for us as we had a fairly large group and it was always a short walk to the pool and restaurant area or beach. The grounds were gorgeous and well kept, and the fact that you could walk into Playa del Carmen in 20mins made the location that much more convenient. Lastly if you are considering this resort for your wedding I highly recommend it- Gloria (the Guest Services/Wedding Coordinator) does a fantastic job of organizing everything and putting on a fantastic event. We couldn't have asked for things to have gone better, and the resort photographers Matius and Augustus are phenomenal- they did an amazing job on our wedding photos and were around everyday taking photos of everyone at the resort. I highly recommend this resort for anyone looking to get away for an relaxing week in the sun who doesn't need all the comforts of a fancy resort. The staff and atmosphere definitely make it a great value for your $$ indeed!", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "prince albert, sk", "Title": "\u201cgreat location..needs refurbishing\u201d", "Author": "kcir", "ReviewID": "UR97855457", "Content": "there is no better location in Playacar and the beach is as good as it gets.....the resort is very dated but well maintained...outside of the breakfast buffet the only place to eat or drink is down by the beach until the evening when the other bar opens plus the small disco, and we certainly did not care for this...the rooms are ok in size, nice balcony, but the shower is really quite in need of an upgrade, but at least the water was hot....we had an opportunity to move and took advantage of it and lucked out with another resort in Playacar 5 minutes away.....with the appropriate renovations this resort could be out of this world as it is the right size, and the location is perfect......a 20 minute walk on the sidewalk or beach gets you to town, and a little plaza 2 minutes away with a Starbucks and free internet just buy a coffee....this is a 3 star resort at best but a 5 star location....", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ladysmith, BC", "Title": "\u201cPicture Perfect Location!\u201d", "Author": "WendyRLadysmith_BC", "ReviewID": "UR97383814", "Content": "This was our 1st trip to the Mayan ...it was fantastic!

Although this didn't happen to us, we had spoken to a few that were approached and were able to advise them on our findings. Just say no and don't fall for the pitch. Remember nothing is for free! As stated, rooms were not ready until 3pm, even though we arrived at 11am. We enjoyed full use of the facilities while the bellman at the front watched our luggage. We were asked our preference of rooms and didn't get a single request BUT we voiced our opinions and moved into a room that we knew was coming free. Front desk help was always extremely helpful. We were first put in 2111, top level beside tennis courts. Although extremely private, we had trouble sleeping as it's a top level and those birds are up cooing and chirping and pecking etc on the thatch roof before the crack of dawn. We did see some small holes in the roof and could see the light of day through them so we were concerned if it rained. The upper level rooms 'seem' larger, but it could be because of the open space. The bathrooms are bare minimum, but what more do you want other than a place to shower/bath and use facilities. I have long hair and never had a problem with water pressure or rinsing my hair out. The rooms were always cleaned and towels replaced. A little skimpy on the soap, but they provide bath gel and shampoo in dispensers on the wall in tub. Beds were a little hard, but we expected this. The pillows were comfy and it just made us appreciate our own bed all the more :) We were moved to room 2703 and it was great. Although not as private, it was on a main walkway and on a corner, we were close to the pools and close to the main building. A good mid point. This had the king sized bed we requested and had a little bit of greenery outside of terrace for a bit of privacy. We didn't use the hammocks, but the terrace had plenty of room for sitting and enjoying the beautiful weather. We sat there and watched the heavy downpour as well and were quite comfortable. There are no dressers but there are shelves and both rooms had a lot of hangers, so we were fine for the week. The food was a bit repetitive but we didn't starve. The lunch buffet at the pool bar was excellent and they had a grill that served hot dogs/hamburgers, nachos etc... There was also a Pizza Bar that filled the void. Nestor at the pool bar gets high marks from both of us as he was always smiling and really made our stay enjoyable. Take a moment or two to talk to the wait staff and get to know a bit about their lives. The entertainment staff really tried hard and seemed to have willing participants for the games around the pool and during evening shows. We enjoyed the Disco and Las Vegas nights, they were quite humorous. The beach and location would have to be the best part of it all. The beach was always busy as it was a major walk by with tourists heading to Playa del Carmen. About a 20 minute walk along the beach. Excellent stroll! Lots of loungers to be had and the vendors were there but they weren't pushy or annoying. Wait staff were willing to serve you on beach as well. As said in previous reviews, bring your own bubbas or big cups. We had no complaints as to the alcohol content. My boyfriend asked for bacardi and got it. They were very generous with their portions of alcohol in drinks :) Only Corona on tap though. We booked our Xel Ha excursion through Juan. He has a booth set up just outside lobby by the ramp to upper level in main building. He was a bit cheaper but the service was the same. All in all we had an excellent vacation. It was very relaxing and stress free. No worries about walking around in your bathing suit all day. We felt safe and secure. There was a good range of guests ages. The disco can't even really be called a disco, it is small but has a pool table and a big screen t.v. for sports fans. We were usually so beat from our long days in the sun that when the bars closed at 11, we were good to go back to room and crash. If you're hoping to sit in room and watch t.v. all day, this might not be the place to go... unless you understand spanish :) We did get 2 channels that were english and they played movies for the most part. We also got CNN so we were up to date on world events. A week without t.v. isn't necessarily a bad thing. The grounds were very well kept and all in all a clean well run resort.

One of the best words of wisdom I read on this site before going was \"If you go expecting a 3-star resort you will not be disappointed\". This description holds true. It is not a 5-start resort but even though the rooms are very basic and could use painting and some minor repairs they were always very clean and I never felt uncomfortable going to sleep at night. The buffets were a bit repetitive but we could always find something good to eat....great burgers and pizzas around the pool. If you want a really nice meal be sure to book early and go to the Italian restaurant. If you are a wine lover bring your own....the house wine is awfull!!! The resort is a nice size and not too spread out so getting around is easy. The beach is one of the nicest I have ever been to. The resort grounds are always very well maintained, and the pools were very clean, and the staff were always friendly and pleased to help out. I am not sure where the comments about being hassled by timeshare people are coming from as we were never bothered once the whole week. One concern that I will agree with however is that this resort is notorious for getting overbooked and then sending guests off to other resorts. While we were there they were asking for volunteers to go to the \"5-star\" Occidental Grand in Cozumel with all the travel covered and extra resort vouchers while there so we decided to take them up on the offer and go for 2 nights. They delivered on everything promissed, however, although the resort had much nicer rooms, and better food, we actually were glad to get back to the Allegro.

If you want an American type of 5 star high rise resort, then book that. All the Canadians we partyed with had an awesome time, some have returned several times -yes there are a lot of non-speaking english people but it looked like they had fun. You get a resort on a 5 star beach walking distance to Playa del Carmen. You get a good selection of food all day. You get premium liquor if you ask. I always asked for Barcardi and got it. Our family enjoyed the variety of drinks = blended or mixed. The Corona beer was cold. The bartenders would fill up any size of cup you had or just use their cups. Ask for a GO cup if you want to walk or go out of the resort. Some days we tipped other days we didn't. The service was awesome no matter what. You get 2 pools - quiet or fun with music.

My wife & I spent 2 weeks all-inclusive at the resort 24 Dec., 2010 - 8 Jan., 2011. Most of the time we were there had breakfast and dinner at the resort except for the times we were in Play del Carmen (PDC) or out exploring the country side or scuba diving. We did spend a few days at the pool and the beach in front of the resort, just hanging out and taking in the sun. By far the Allegro beach is the least crowded and most convenient for those long walks to PDC (45-60 min) or to go snorkeling at the far south west end of the beach about 3/4 hour in the opposite direction of PDC. The Allegro is a 3 star Mexicana style complex. If you want high end go somewhere else and pay the $$$$+ We enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel from the immaculately kept grounds to the very friendly staff. We had a second story suite (3615) away from the beach and that was perfect. Very little noise for morning coffee on the deck and evening drinks before dinner. The all-inclusive buffet selections were good. Remember, this is Mexico and the food is Mexicana style, so North American food is not on the buffet menu. There are several things to be aware of when staying at the resort. Firstly, I love red wine and the red wine at the Allegro is terrible. My wife said the white wine is tolerable. I ended up going to Wal-Mart in PDC and buying some L.A. Cieto Cab. Sav. at 110 pesos per bottle. A reasonable red and worth bringing it back to the room. In the complex, the units are built to Mexican standards and complaints about smells are occasionally valid. The toilets, bathtub/shower and sink drainage are all connected to the sewer system w/o outside venting. Thus, you sometimes get sewage \"smell\" backup. I went out and bought some room deodorizer spray and we survived quite nicely. It was no big deal. If you like to sit out on your balcony in the evening and/or at night, take some Off insect repellent with you as the no-seems and mosquitoes come out. Our suite was up in the palm trees. The bats also put on a good display feeding on those insects. The rooms are comfortable, beds are solid, however, the walls between the rooms paper thin. Again, Mexicana style. Most annoying were the drunks at 3AM arguing next door or hollering nearby outside. If you take your laptop, do not purchase the Allegro WiFi packages. They are expensive $20 for 2 hours and generally do not work because of a poor Internet service provider, not the Allegro's fault. Go to the Playa Plaza down the street, buy a Starbucks coffee and get your connection for the price of the coffee. Oh, take your own large mugs from home for mucho grande coffee and cerveza when at the resort. Cab fare to PDC el centro is 50 pesos, but further into town 70 pesos. The walk to PDC via the sidewalk is about 1/2 hr. Finally, remember that tipping is part of the service culture in Mexico. We always ensured that we had 20 peso notes <$2.00 to tip (la propina) at each meal for the waiter, the maid who cleaned the room every day, bar tenders at the pool bar, dining room etc. Also, try to pick up and/or learn some Spanish words as that will serve you well with the locals.

I recommend just taking small denominations of American money as that is what all their prices are compared to, and even though the Canadian dollar is par, our dollar is still lower?? It might be easy to get money as there are thousands of ATM machines but the charge is terrible so save yourself the trouble and just take the money with you. You need to experience \"fifth avenue\" in Playa Del Carmen once but after that just go to the Plaza closest to the hotel - their prices are the same and you can deal just as well. The beach is great - not enough chairs though. The hotel in general needs an overhaul but that does not have anything to do with the staff - they sure try hard!! Thumbs up to the chefs at the beach buffet!! and Nester and the boys at the beach bar!! They work for their money!! All in all, we had a great holiday and tried to spend minimal time in the room. The main buffet had a good selection of food (not great) but they sure try hard! Recommend the mexican restaurant - awesome food!! Did not go to the Italian - too busy but it also got good reviews. A little tidbit: The higher the room number, the closer you are to the beach and the pools....we were in the 5600 blocks which was one building away from the beach.....we loved it! The winds from the ocean are a little cool at night and on a cloudy days so make sure to bring a light to medium weight coat. It is their winter too.

It was a nice place as far as location at the resort , (next to the pool ) , food was O.K. , (one week of that was enough--Missed U.S. food ). Now the problem........When you get a safe, make sure it works 24-7. Ours worked the first two days.Next morning it didn't. Went to the front desk and reported it at 7:30am. They said they would send someone right down. Told him we had to leave at 8:00 for a tour. No show, We left assuming that they would come down and fix the problem , Yea right.. Didn't think to check it when we got back late that nite. When the wife looked in there the next am.,her extra watch was missing along with 2 diamond necklaces which were all in a baggie. They left the FAKE jewelry and some loose change in there. I went to the lobby and when asked if I could be helped , I said yes , someone stole jewelry from my room ,he was on his radio and the phone at the same time, Other visitors were watching this and there people had me in there office in less than 3 minutes !!!!!! Imagine that. They put on a good show down at our room,the five investigators they had. I had to fill out a report, tore our room apart , checked everything. Found nothing--NO KIDDING---Talked to the assistant manager everday--said they were checking outside videos,,our card lock on the door, said that us and the maid were the only ones in the room. talked to the maid, and she said she didn't take it. I laughed and told him--What did you think she was going to say ? Would I waste parts of my vacation just to come up here and deal with this ? (4 days) He was gone on Friday which I figured would happen as we were leaving the next am. He was there and we went the rounds 1 more time before we left. He told me he had to believe the maid,,Told me she had been there 15 years--earlier in the week he said 8 years .He told me that everything was recorded and sent to CORPORATE IN MIAMI from his computer and for me to check with my travel agent and she could check on this for me when we got home for some possible reimbursement. Called her this am , and she done everything but laugh in my face. Has nothing to do with any of that and he was just trying to get me out of there.I agreed. The dollar value does not bother me as much as the sentimental value. After the maid was brought to the stand , we never recieved bottled water , kleenex's, or cute little towel animals on our bed.

We were... no kidding, counting the days to come home. Reading the reviews prior to going, we kept an open mind. However, the trip was so negative, we HAD to write this so that hopefully nobody has to go through what we did. The good: Location on the beach. Pool/Bar staff. The Italian Theme dinner night. The Bad: There is almost too much to list. Almost everything eles. The resort was labelled a 4*. This is definately NOT true. Maybe a 2*. MAYBE! Resort looks good until you get to your room. Old. Smells like mildew and sewer. You can hear the conversation word for word of people in next room. The bed, no kidding, is concrete on the bottom with a old mattress on top. The mattress is covered with an old egg crate foam. On top of that is a plastic bed cover. HARD AS A ROCK! We were told there were soft drinks and snacks supplied. Not true. You get water in your room if you are lucky. After 2 days of no water and going up to the front desk 4 times, we were finally given 3 small bottles. My husband unfortunately got sick down there due to a pre-existing condition. I am a nurse, and due to the medical insurance runaround, we were not able to get the hospital. Think I got any help from the Resort????? Nope... Instead, I got yelled at from the Nolitours Representative in the middle of the lobby because I wouldn't pay $150 to see their resort doctor. When I explained all he needed was an IV, I was told I could buy one at any Pharmacy and just needed to talk to their doctor on the phone. The doctor proceeded to tell me I had to go the the hospital to get one and I was charged to speak to him regardless. Needless to say, he never got one because it was the weekend, and our Insurance Office wasn't open and the Mexico Hospital charges you $3000 cash upfront to be seen. When we finally did make it home to Canada, my husband went straight to the Hospital Emergency Room and spent 3 days there in Acute Care. Another thing to watch out for, collect calls. They don't inform you that there is a \"service charge\" for making a collect call. Works out to $4 each. Regardless of if you get through or not. We were also warned about time share cons. We fell for it. The resort invites you to receive a free welcome gift. IT IS NOT!!!!! We were told the resort was full, and they were trying to upgrade people to their sister resort to empty some more rooms out. We asked flat out if it was a time share and were told no. Under no circumstance!!!! So we figured fine. No problem. Ya, right. It will only take 90 minutes to show us the other place and if we like it we can move there. 4 hours later, it was a gimmick to show us a HUGE resort that I admit was nice, but most definitely a time share. Or as they worded it, \"A promotion within our hotel\". We are both in our thirties. We thought it would be a nice relaxing vacation. Not so. During the 5 days my husband was sick, the chambermaids actually got mad at me because I wouldn't let them clean our room. I don't know if they get paid by the room, but holy crap! !!! I got clean sheets and towels and did everything myself.

The resort was very different and unique. The 4 unit rooms are thatch covered and mexican style colored walls with ceramic tile. The top units are the same as the bottom other than they have balconies and although the bed was rock hard, I still had a good sleep every night. The maid service was exceptional and very thorough. The first night we arrived, we were put in a room with a wobbly ceiling fan and the air conditioner did not work well, but when I went to the front desk and asked to be moved, they accomodated our request the next morning and were put in an upper unit closer to the pool. The food was excellent every day and the staff were very friendly. If you visit this resort, ask about their 4 course lobster dinner served on the beach in the evening, excellent and the waiter was so good to us, very nice and reasonable. The community of Playa Del Carmen was beautiful, the architecture of the homes and condos was breathtaking. We walked down to 5th avenue(about a 20 minute walk from the hotel, 5 minutes or 50 pesos by taxi) that went for blocks with many many little stores and very lively and entertaining, we enjoyed ourselves at night down this street and went back a few times, very safe and friendly. The only disappointment for us was that the sun did not come out much the week we were there but it was still very warm. The ferry to Cozumel is a must and we saw huge cruise ships docked at the port and this little island, about a 20 minute ferry ride, was very nice. For the value, this little resort was well worth it and I would definitely go back. Do not visit the bird sanctuary on the way to 5th avenue, not worth the 22 american dollars they charge per person, we saw maybe 5 different types of tropical birds and really not worth it.

We got a good deal on an all inclusive trip, and it was worth every penny we paid. I don't know if I would pay full price for the resort though. The rooms were nice, they had air conditioning and a ceiling fan, we were in an upper room, so we had a thatched roof, which was really neat. The downside to the thatched roof was that the last night we were there it was pouring rain and there were a couple of leaks in the roof. The beds are a bit on the hard side, but they have to be because of the humidity. I didn't mind them though and slept well every night. Each room had their own hammock as well which was great for relaxing, they also had a safe for our valuables. We could also hear our neighbors through the walls, but I think that the roof had a lot to do with that. There are also family rooms which are right down by the ocean and looked like they'd be really nice. The resort has two pools, one of them has a swim up bar, and a great beach. The food was great. They have two a la carte restaurants, a Mexican and an Italian one, I'd say that the Mexican was better. They also had a breakfast and supper buffet, yes they did have hot dogs in the buffet, but they also had a lot of other different foods, and every night the supper buffet was a different theme. During they day they have a pizzeria and a lunch buffet as well as a grill cooking lunch right down by the pools. At night they have different live shows performed by some of the workers in the resort, some shows were better than others. The resort itself is in a great location, it's about a five minute walk from a little market (with a Starbucks), and about a 15-20 minute walk from 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen (faster if you take a taxi).

Want to go back NOW\u201d", "Author": "lalita74", "ReviewID": "UR91867916", "Content": "As I write this review, I start to get nostalgic in just thinking how wonderful this vacation was. I stayed at the Allegro Dec 21-28, 2010. We were 3 families, 7 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 children for a total of 11 of us. This was our second time staying at the Allegro but first for the other 2 families. We stayed in rooms 4101, 4112, and 2105- good location and comfortable rooms. The rooms were fine, nothing fancy. YES, the beds are hard because they don\u2019t have box springs, they have them made out of cement so there is no bounce in the mattress. What they add is bed padding and it does the job. The mini fridge was always stocked- no complaints. The maid service was great, with the kids brining in so much sand and water into the room, I was grateful someone else was doing the cleaning and not me. We had wonderful service throughout the resort. Everyone in the front desk, pool, beach, restaurants, and activity areas were always pleasant and greeted you always with a smile. I also have to compliment all the Canadians that stayed in the resort. You guys ruled and were very nice people! I have to say, most guests in this resort were from Canada and not too many Europeans or Americans. There were a few Mexicans (ME) but they were also living abroad like my family. The resort grounds were absolutely immaculate. They really take care of their garden and make sure all plants and grass look green all the time. The pools cleaned every morning from the leaves that may fall into the water. Every morning you wake up to a well maintained resort even though you know very well that the night before the guests made a mess of it all. The staff work very late hours and make sure everything is left the same for the next day. There is no need to reserve a chair on the beach or pool. Although the resort was fully booked, 700 guests, you never even noticed it was full. Many people went on excursions or left the resort to go shopping or walk around. The location of Allegro is ideal for walks and for tours. Everything is so accessible and near. The pool temperature was a bit chilly, but nothing stopped us form going in! The temperature of the ocean water was just right. It\u2019s not your normal 90-100F water temperature, it was about 75-80F which was perfect. The beach is definitely the most attractive part of the resort. It is enormous! The change from the first visit to this second one is radical. If you like to collect seashells and even if you don\u2019t, you will certainly find them and bring some back home to decorate your home or just simply stare at remember where you were not too long ago. Like I mentioned before, the resort was packed and they offered guest a deal. I thought it was but did not take the offer. The offer was to go to Allegro in Cozumel. You would leave Dec 25-and return Dec 26 or 27. The resort would pay for cab and ferry fees both ways. There would be no difference in hotel fees. They would have loved it if we had said yes, but it involved packing again and unpacking, that is why we said no. Otherwise, it would have been a good excursion on the resorts expense. The food was OK. It was not the best or worst, they had their good days and their BLAH days. They certainly out did themselves 3 times out of the 7 we stayed. Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Dec 27th. They closed down the restaurants and served buffet style out in the open for all the guests. They had every dish you can imagine and it was never ending food from 6pm-10pm. We were amazed on how good everything was. The drinks were great! I don\u2019t know why some people complain about the drinks being too weak. I saw enough drunk people at this resort that I am sure will agree with me in saying that the MOJITOS were awesome! Since this is my 4th visit to PDC, I feel comfortable and travel using the ADO bus. We went to Tulum (again) and Cancun. For those of you thinking about or not sure, DOIT. Traveling by public transportation is safe, cheap and comfortable! The ride to Tulum was $56 pesos one way and the entrance to the ruins was $51 pesos. The trip was under $15 usd per person. At the resort they were charging $40 usd per person, what a difference if you do it on your own. The ride to Cancun is even cheaper, $42 pesos one way. We went to the public beach, \u201cEl mirador\u201d. As soon as you get off the ADO bus in Cancun, cross the street or ask where the R-1 bus stop is, it\u2019s just across the street on the corner. Anyway, hop on the R-1 bus, pay $8 pesos (under$1 usd) and ask the driver to let you know when to get off. Enjoy the ride, the scenery and take in the culture! Once you get off at the beach stop, you will be glad you did it all, the view of the ocean blue is like no other. The beach is clean and has been upgraded. They have restrooms and some umbrella stands. The beach is free, this is where the locals and some tourist hang out. Go, I guarantee you will love it! As for the resort, I give it a 10+. My entire family and I would go back in a heartbeat. You can\u2019t beat the location and staff. The rooms could use an update, and they will. I spoke to a few people that run the resort and they are aware that the rooms need an upgrade and that is exactly what will happen this year. The first thing they renovated was the BEACH, and boy did they do a good job. The grounds are fine so no worries in that dept. As for the view, just remember, no matter what resort you stay in, they all share the same beautiful beach. So if you don\u2019t mind paying 5 star prices go for it, otherwise stay at the Allegro that is rated 3 stars and splurge a little more on the shopping and tours. In my eyes, the Allegro is not given the credit it deserves. BUT I can tell you that there are a lot of returned guests at this resort and that means a lot, more than any star rating in my opinion. I\u2019m one of them!

Definitely book your \u00e0 la cartes right when you check-in because one of the restaurants isn\u2019t open every day! They do have 2 domestic beers (canned Budweiser was one of them). For people who drink wine forget having anything decent. The wine at the resort is (or must be) made locally from wine kits. It\u2019s full of yeast and tastes horrible! I recommend going to Playa del Carmen which is 20 minutes away walking from the hotel to purchase a decent bottle of wine for 110 pesos. Evening entertainment isn\u2019t too exciting, you are better off going to Playa del Carmen. I highly recommend the Coba Mayan Adventure Tour which is an all day tour. The women in charge of booking these tours are very knowledgeable but ask questions about the tours (what to wear, what to bring) because they are always busy and they do not always remember what to tell you.

I was a bit nervous after reading all the reviews, but was pleasantly surprised at the location, the beach and even the hotel. The hotel is made up of about 25 small cabanas with 8 units each, 4 up and 4 down. My only complaint with the rooms is that there is no privacy as the walls are made of cinderblock and hollow and noise travels very easily between rooms and floors. Another couple we spoke to at the resort was in an upstairs room and said that the walls didnt go completely up to the roof, so that made it even more noisy. The room itself wasnt fancy, but it was clean and functionned well (except for the low water pressure and a grumpy toilet that didnt always want to flush :/ Our room had a kingsize bed ( a bit hard but ok), plus an old tv with one english channel and lousy reception, plus a bathroom and closet with a safe, two chairs and a coffee maker. The maid cleaned our room daily (mostly around 3pm ) and left 2 bottles of water each day. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is a 25 minute walk to Playa Del Carmen, which is a major shopping location that runs along 5th street for 28 blocks. There are shops full of tourist souveniers, cigar shops, diamond stores, silver jewellery, and a scattering of large and small cafes. There are even 2 mcdonalds and 2 subway restaurants and a wallmart store located up the road on 8th avenue. Playa Del Carmen is a gaited community and very safe. We had no problems walking either along the beach or on the sidewalks in the evenings though we were told not to walk to beach at night. Our hotel staff was great. The waiters in the breakfast buffet sang and joked with the guests, and always had a smile on their faces. The front desk staff were polite and a bit reserved, but if you engaged them in conversation they were happy to chat. There are two computers located in the little shop in the main lobby, surfing the net is 2 bucks for 9 minutes but beware the internet is slower than a turtle.... 9 minutes gave me time to check my email and say hola on facebook before it was done... My only complaint at this hotel would be the food quality and quantity. Having stayed at the RIU in Montego Bay last Christmas, there was no comparison. The food at the Allegro was boring, bland and the same every day. For breakfast there was a reasonably good spread of eggs, toast, fruit, some hot items like pancakes and french toast, and after a hint from another guest about the bacon, we asked for it only to have it produced from a back room... apparently the is a big secret.. so if you want bacon you have to ask for it LOL. Lunch was at the pool area.There was a pizza bar that made OK pizza, and a grill that made hamburgers, hotdogs, nachos and a variety of grilled fish and chicken. The Lunch buffet was located by the pool bar and served the same thing every day - a collection of cold pastas, a few salad items, and the spaghetti bar at one end where you could get spaghetti made with tomatoe sauce or alfredo sauce. We had spaghetti most days for lunch. Our last night at the Allegro was New Years Eve. The staff spent most of the day setting up a gala dinner on the beach despite the high north winds that plagued us for the last few days of our stay in Mexico. The spread of food that was put on was great. Shrimp at least 5 inches long, shishkabobs, grilled chicken, grilled pork, a huge variety of potatoes, noodles, salads, bread and of course all the drinks you could manage served to your table by the waiters and waitresses assigned to each section. There was even a show put on, but since we had to get up at 3 am to get ready for our return flight, we didnt see much of it before retiring to our room to pack and organize for our departure. Would I stay here again? probably not. Why? because of the food and the noise of the rooms. Was it good value for the money? yes I think so as this was an inclusive hotel so taking into consideration the flight to and from, the meals and the drinks, it was decent value for money. I would try to get a last minute deal and save as much as possible so you have some leftover money to travel to Playa Del Carmen to take in some of the excellent restaurants and save yourself the monotony of the food at the hotel. Lastly, the two theme restaurants at the hotel, the Mexican and the Italian were a huge disappointment.

Just a note to single travellers, this resort had several and I wouldn't hesitate going to this resort on my own. The resort is somewhat dated but we all loved the fact it was a smaller resort; the staff was fabulous; the activities staff, Jaun, Angel & Moses couldn't have been more entertaining. Although I went to sit on my lounge chair for the entire week, they made you want to take part. Our maid Rebeca was fantastic as well, fresh sheets, always lots of supplies and extremely friendly. Staff always had a smile and a friend \"Hola\", bar staff was fantastic as well-my favorite drink for the week was a Cabana with no banana-fantastic! Each room has a hammock on their balcony/porch which is fantastic. I would highly recommend if possible getting a room right near the pool/Mexican restaurant-ours was 5403 with was a perfect location. Food was good as well, the buffets were somewhat bland the odd night, but the pasta bar was fantastic. We ate at both the Mexican and Italian which were exceptional. The pizza stand and burger/fries and nacho spot were great, always tons of food. Wine-you decide, I wasn't crazy about it. The grounds and beach were extremely well maintained. I walked to Playa del Carmen almost every morning along the beach, gorgeous walk and only 10-15 minutes. I would highly recommend a full body massage from Elizabeth at poolside and stop in and say Hola to Jorge along the walkway up to the dinner buffet. If I was the type of person to go back to the same resort, I wouldn't hesitate to visit the Allegro again-but my theory has alway been if you are lucky enough to get away, never go to the same place twice.

One single lady we met had been before. She booked 10 months ago for a 4 week stay and was very upset and in tears at having to move for the first week. The Allegro had very disappointing accommodation. They looked lovely from the outside(small units with thatched roofs) but the interiors were VERY basic and in need of a refurb. The first room was near the pool and quite noisy with people walking by. The bathroom had nasty stained wall tiles, a broken washing line and an erratic shower. The second one was an improvement with a bathroom in better condition. Both rooms had faulty lights, which were quickly repaired. One small but annoying point was a shortage of power points so you could not have the TV, fridge and coffee maker all on at the same time. There were holes in the thatch which were easy for the mosquitoes to gain entrance, so make sure you take a plug-in. I could easily hear the neighbours through the walls especially one who had a 6.30am call every morning. Despite the stains, the rooms were immaculate and the hammock on the patio great fun. There was a large selection of food at the buffet, but after a week it all seemed much the same. I would not have liked to have eaten there for 2 weeks. There was only one restaurant to eat at for lunch. It became very crowded and the food not very inviting. What is it with this hotel--you could never get a spoon- they were like gold dust! On a positive note, the grounds were beautiful and very well maintained. The location was good. We walked into PDC twice (25 mins) once along the beach and once along the streets passing the aviary (22USD!) and some Mayan ruins. The town is bustling and has many tourist shops.

The grounds were beautiful and for the most part the staff were good. Things were just not in the butffet restaurant.

The location is perfect - along the ocean within Playacar, a gated community right in Playa Del Carmen. The beach is beautiful with no rocks or weeds in the water. During the day you can walk on the beach all the way to 5th Avenue. A ten minute 5 dollar taxi ride from the resort takes you into town. We have been travelling to Playa for more than 10 years, stayed in hotels, condos and apartments and other all inclusive hotels. We found the cost of a week's all inclusive stay including flight at the Allegro to be a very good deal and are happy we picked this resort. We booked through Nolitours and the total cost for the week was less than we have paid for just airfare in the past. When we have stayed in Playa for months at a time, it has been more economical to rent an apartment. For a week or two family vacation, especially with children and teenagers, this resort is ideal. It is not a large resort and to us it is an ideal size to walk to the resort beach or to the restaurant with children or an older family member. There are connecting rooms for families who require them. There were a mixture of young couples, singles, teenagers, families and retirees at the resort when we were there. The young couples and single people tended to gather wherever the activities were during the day and appeared to be having a great time. Guests were from all over North America, Europe and South America. We were pleasantly surprised at how beautiful and well kept the grounds are and how nice we were treated by all the staff. The activities staff were friendly, professional and made sure everyone had a good time. Activities are offered all day, but there is no pressure to participate. Most daily activities were offered by the pool. People who did not wish to participate in the activities were happy sitting on the lounge chairs with a drink and snack socializing with other guests. Families with small children tended to use the large pool on the other side of the snack bar. The beach is beautiful and right next door to the 5 diamond Royal Hideaway Resort. The rooms are not luxurious, but are what the average 3 star hotel in Canada would be. Our housekeeper Lucy kept the room spotless and we have no complaints at all about the room. We loved the balcony with the hammock and table and chairs when we wanted to relax. The TV is outdated, but has the standard area Hotel Cable TV package. We spent very little time in our room, so that wasn't a problem for us. The evening entertainment was good and the theatre was full every evening. There was a half-hour mini-disco each evening at 9 in which children from the kids club were given an opportunity to perform on stage. Children we saw with the Kids Club staff were having a great time during the day and they were very excited when we heard them telling their parents what they did during the day. Breakfast consisted of pancakes, waffles, fresh omlettes, eggs, fresh fruit, fresh breads and pastries, toast and a hot breakfast buffet. Lunch at the Snack Bar consisted of a hot lunch buffet, soup, fresh pasta, hamburgers, hot dogs and fries in addition to the salad bar, a variety of different breads and pastries and desserts. Pizza was also served from noon until 6 was made fresh all afternoon. Evening buffets were good and there was a section where pork chops, chicken or fish was freshly grilled. There was a fresh pasta station, numerous hot dishes in the buffet section, desserts and serve yourself ice cream. There are two restaurants at the resort where you can order off the menu - the Mexican Restaurant and the Italian Restaurant. If you want to try an excellent authentic Mexican meal, take a 5 dollar taxi drive to El Fogon by Wallmart in the evening. There are always taxi's waiting at the bottom of the escalators in Wallmart to take you back to the resort. Or, take a walk down 5th Avenue and catch a taxi by the Bus Station. At the bar in Allegro, order a \"Banana Momma\" drink and take it back to your balcony for a relaxing afternoon drink. If you want a high end resort with excellent al la carte meals and are prepared to pay a much higher price, we recommend The Royal Hideaway next door where we have had great food and excellent service. If you want a night life after the evening entertainment, take a 5 dollar taxi ride and head to 5th Avenue where all the action is - many night clubs, bars, etc. Taxis are always waiting outside the front door at the resort. We recommend the Allegro Playacar resort for its location, its beach, the beautiful clean grounds and the wonderful staff.

The rooms were better than I expected after reading reviews. The style was very charming and we loved the thatched vaulted roof. There was rain one day and it did not leak at all.

(we tipped them very well. they deserved it) The bartenders at the pool bar were slightly less friendly but they spoke less English and were very busy most of the time. The beach was fantastic and swimming in the ocean was awesome. The pool was fun but the constant techno music was very tiresome (catering to the Europeans, I assume).

Having stayed here in 2007 & had great time, we returned. I checked recent reviews & was a little apprehensive, but, once again, we had great time...so thought I'd give a good review!!! Best part is the location. Some of these resorts can be isolated. I love the fact that town's just a 20 min walk along beach or a $5 taxi (set rate). Someone has said they didn't go because they thought it might be dangerous. Don't worry! 5th Avenue is main drag with all shops bars & restaurants. More on side streets & beach. Well worth a visit (or 2). Some will try to get you in there shop, but they aren't persistent, & can be quite amusing (\"come & let me sell you some rubbish\"). In 2007 the beach had been washed away by hurricane. That has been replaced & it's back to it's former self. The grounds are also very well kept. I thought the variety of the food was pretty good. Lunch buffet by pool area - always the fresh pasta option, bbq area where there are always freshly cooked burgers/hot dogs & daily specials, salads & enough choice surely!!! And there's the fall back option of the pizza bar from 10 - 6 daily. Evening buffet theme varied, again always the pasta on offer & something being cooked fresh as well as the rest of the buffet. Agreed - the wine isn't great. We caught the evening show a couple of times, which was quite fun. But there wasn't alot going on at night, just people sitting around by various bars having a few drinks. It's a quiet time of year, but then if you want something livelier - town's a 5 min taxi with plenty going on. I found the staff very helpful & friendly, from the ground staff, cleaners, maids to the bar staff, waiters & entertainment. Most spoke English - or enough for whatever their job was! I was told by the staff that the hotel is being refurbed next year. Probably about time. The rooms are starting to look a little tired. The TV is poor quality - but I don't go on holiday to sit & watch tv so not a huge issue. The shower always had hot water & the air con worked. Some of the trips they push can be done alot cheaper if you do them yourself. We took a 60 peso collectivo (taxi) to Akumal, & paid 15$ each to hire boat with our own guide & hire snorkelling equipment to see reef & see turtles & stingrays. I think they wanted about 50$ each at hotel to do it (with atvs included). Tulum can also be easily reached by collectivo & a 5$ entry instead of Hotels charges. But we did a couple of good trips through the hotel as well - Xplor was a good fun day. Someone from States complained about the Europeans behaviour on here which made me chuckle. There was a broad range represented from USA, Canada, Mexico & most of Europe. I'm not going to go into stereotyping, but people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones (don't know how that English saying translates to anyone else!). Everyone I saw got on together. And Europe covers alot of different cultures. Don't lump us all in together! It's not a 5*luxury hotel, but it is very good for a relaxing break in a great location at a reasonable price.

But, I went with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. I went with a couple of girlfriends for a relaxing getaway. We wanted to stay at a villa-like resort, not a big hotel and were willing to give up a few conveniences for some character and culture. Maybe the time of year people go makes a big difference, I would definitely recommend traveling in October as there was little crowd and the weather was wonderful with the exception of a few short rainstorms. The beach was amazing, perfect white sand and turquoise water. Some of the chairs were a bit weathered, but it wasn't a big deal. The pools could use some updating, there were a few missing tiles and chipped/peeling paint on the ledge, but it wasn't dirty. We were approached a few times by the entertainment staff to particpate in activities or take a tour, but it wasn't excessive and they just took 'no thanks' for an answer and moved along. The room was small and a little outdated, but very clean and fine for what we were looking for. The air conditioning worked fine, though the first night it was a little stuffy and I can imagine a summer stay might put a strain on the system. We were upgraded to an ocean front room, and it was just great...5703...right on the beach, close to the pool, but private. It was on the first floor, I don't know what the second floor rooms are like. The food was pretty good. Mostly the same things on the buffet every day, no matter what the theme for the meal was. The egg station was very good, and the pasta bar was always an option. The restaurants were ok, but the service was average and there were a lot more choices at the buffet. We weren't going for a gourmet food experience, and survived just fine on tacos, chips and guacamole. Not many options for vegetarians, but rice and beans were always available. As with most all-inclusive resorts, the drinks were weak and the bartenders were busy. Lots of fruity frozen stuff with plenty of calories and not much liquor, even when we tipped. Corona was on tap. The wine was really inconsistant. A few times the house red was really good, other nights it was just drinkable. I'm no wine snob, but it was fine by me. The alcohol situation would probably be my biggest complaint. Not that we were planning a Spring Break-like drunken vacation, but we did think we would be able to get a little tipsy. The service was good, everyone was friendly. Most people spoke some English and my Spanglish kept us going. There were very few American guests. Lots of Canadians and Italians. It didn't bother me, after all we were trying to get away from it all! But, the speedos, topless sunbathers and smoking were a bit distracting. The indoor places were non-smoking, but it was hard to avoid it outdoors. At least the staff kept the ashtrays clean for the most part. We were on a budget and didn't go on any excursions. But, we did splurge on a massage. It was fine, $70 US for 65 minutes...not a deal but better than the price at home. If I had it to do over I probably would've spent the money on zip-lining since I had plenty of time to relax the rest of the trip and could've used some more adventure. We weren't big on nightlife either. We went to the show in the theater after dinner each night and found it entertaining. There were groups going into town to the big clubs each night for $15 you would get transportation, cover charge and drinks. Seemed like a good deal if you were looking for that kind of thing. The disco at the resort was basically empty...but the whole place was pretty quiet while we were there...mostly couples (young and older) and a few small groups. The only other thing I remembered from the other reviews was the complaint about town being so far away. We decided not to go into town because our family and friends were worried about crime and we really didn't want to spend extra money. But, there was a mini shopping area just across the street from the resort that had plenty of carts and little stores with the souveniers you would expect. So, I have no idea how long of a walk it is. The ride from the airport was longer than we expected. About 1.5 hours with construction and traffic. I think the hotel website said 40 minutes... Last but not least...we made the vacation plans through Apple Vacations and were happy with all of the arrangements. Their representative was nice and not too pushy about adding extras. Everything went smoothly and we were happy with the service. I know this is a long review, but I think some of the negative comments from others are a little unfair and picky. Like I said, maybe the peak season is different. If you want a luxury vacation this isn't it, but it was definitley not a dive or the 'worst vacation ever'.

There is a show at 9:30 every night but, really not much to do between dinner and then. The bar at the pool doesn't have any music and rarely had anyone at it. And the bar located in the dining area had the rudest bartenders and servers that surrounded it that you just felt like they didn't want you there. The resort claims to have a \"disco\" or something. This is a room the size of a decent sized family room that has a rancid odor...the best description I can think of is the outhouse at my grandparent's cottage with a hint of dead animal. It is a very unwelcoming place to be. So that being said, if you're interested in a resort that is relaxing and quiet after the sun goes down, this is the place. The beach is AWESOME. White sand and great swimming area. Downside - old european men in banana thongs. Yeah, I know you're all so free with your bodies but, some things are not pleasant to look at when trying to enjoy beautiful scenery. One of the things that stuck out in almost every situation we had was the rudeness of many of the staff. After an hour and a half shuttle from the airport (we were told it would be 45 minutes when we booked) and traveling since 4:30am, we tried checking in to our room. It wasn't ready yet. It would be about an hour wait. We headed to the buffet, it was closed. We sat in the lobby for an hour and approached the front desk again...another 20 minutes. Just then another traveller tries checking in and he's told his room will be ready in 2 hours. Check-in is supposed to be 3pm, by now it's going on 5. All the while the two women at the front desk are put off by us and the other traveler upset we couldn't get into our rooms. HOWEVER...there was one front desk employee who was very sweet and nothing like the hyenas when we checked in. Also, most of the staff act put out if they have to speak english. In fact, we had staff who would continue speaking spanish even when we told them we didn't understand what they were saying. At the bar in the dining area, my boyfriend endured two bartenders and serving staff speaking spanish and laughing at him after they gave hima shot of tequila. Finally he asked them if they were making fun of him and one of them told him yes because he was a gringo. Nice, huh? I also had a member of the staff tell me that I should learn the language when I visit their country again. I guess the $2K we spent vacationing in their country wasn't good enough. Lastly (and then I'm done with my rant), if you aren't a fan of Europeans DO NOT GO TO THIS RESORT. The ratio had to be 10 Europeans to every American. They will walk directly into you if you don't move to the side, they reach in front of you to get whatever they are interested in, they stand close enough to you to feel the hairs on your arms, and they stare like it's their job. On one occasion I stood to the side for a gentleman to walk past me so we didn't collide and he looked at me like I was a lunatic. Hey Europeans - a nice \"excuse me\" goes a long way when you absolutely have to be the first one to get a croissant! That's it, rant over. I am recommending this place though (after all that). Reason being, it is a beautiful 20 minute walk on the beach to Playa del Carmen, it's relaxing and quiet, good food, and very affordable. Just ignore the occasional blasting techno the europeans find so soothing while they relax and the rude staff and you are good.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longview, Washington", "Title": "\u201cAn under-appreciated gem.\u201d", "Author": "melindamccrady", "ReviewID": "UR83520439", "Content": "My husband and I just returned this morning from two weeks in Playa del Carmen with another couple. We stayed at the Allegro Playacar in spite of the very mixed reviews on TripAdvisor and other sites. Naturally, we were a little skeptical but we scored a great deal and went for it. Well, we are certainly glad we did! Yes, the hotel rooms need some updating. Ours was upstairs with a king-size bed and a fantastic view of the beach, the pool, and the gorgeous blue sea. The bed was a bit hard, the tv only had a few channels, and the sink dripped. The bathroom tile would have benefitted from a good mason. OK. But it was clean, airy, and the housekeeper was terrific. Our air conditioner and fan worked perfectly, despite all the negative comments we heard. The grounds and the beach are beautiful. Simply gorgeous. The staff was fun, attentive, and professional. Starting with the check-in, our experience was great with the whole staff. I really don't understand what people have been complaining about, frankly. The food at the buffet was pretty good, overall, although I did get a bit bored with it after awhile. But the Mexican and Italian restaurants are simply fabulous, the Mexican fiestas on Friday night were delicious, and the snack bar and pizzaria were great. There is no shortage of food at any time, that's for sure. The drinks were plentiful and available pretty much all the time. The pool area was being worked on while we were there, and it looks great. The landscaping is wonderful, the beach is clean and wide and there were activities going on all the time for those interested. On the other hand, there is a quiet pool for those of us who want to lay in the sun and read a book. Overall, we thought the Allegro was a great find. It may not actually be a five-star resort, but it is comfortable, clean, friendly, and reasonably-priced. We made good friends there and will return. One addition: the last two days of our trip were seriously threatened by Hurricane Paula. We escaped being hit directly, but I cannot say enough about the way the staff helped prepare, just in case. We were offered (and accepted) a room further from the beach for our safety. Everything that could possibly be blown around was picked up and tied down. Trees were trimmed and coconuts removed. Again, all this was done without alarming or over-sensationalizing the situation.

On arrival we checked in without any problems, we did however request a second floor room . However after reading some of the reviews about the thatched roofs leaking we didnt bother to complain when we were allocated a room on the ground floor. We arrived when it was dark and my initial thought when we first enetered the room was oh my goodness i`m not going to like staying here. The room was quite small, dated and quite depressing. We decided to give it a couple of days before moving hotels. The hotel grounds are very well kept, its in a perfect location near the beach, two nice size swimming pools with plenty of sun beds. The swim up bar was in the pool where most of the activities took place, we preferred the quieter pool, we never had a problem finding a sun bed. The staff were always friendly, the food was fine plenty of choice, pizzeria open from 11am till 6pm each day, burgers, french fries, pasta , salad etc. The hotel also catered for mexican food which is fine as there were lots of mexicans staying there and we were in mexico! We did tend to warm to this hotel even though we hated the room, its in desperate need of a makeover. We had connecting doors through to the next room which is great if you need them but we found we could hear the poeple in the next room talking as clear as if they were in the same room! The tv was old and the picture very poor not that I was that bothered as I dont go on holiday to watch tv. From the outside they looked so nice with the thatched roofs, and i liked the hammocks that each room had on the terrace/balcony.

I am writing a review about our stay at Allegro playacar because I believe people should have a CLEAR idea what they are getting themselves into before booking. Overall my stay was ok, the beach made up for all the encounters and upsetting moments I endured during my stay. For starters, The hotel is NOT, I repeat IS NOT within a 5 minute walk to the main avenue ( Quinta avenida (5th and 2cd) Its more like a 25 minute walk. The cab gets there in less then 5 minutes and charges you 50 pesos. These last week the weather was EXTREMELY Hot and very very HUMID, I live in Canada, and have travel to several different countries and have stayed in tropical resorts too. All the resorts or hotels that I have been in and were a 4 star hotel had the basics of AIR CONDITIONING in the main lobby and where the breakfast/lunch and dinner are served. This hotel does not meet a 4 star rating, by far!!! The food was plain, repetative and super hot. (since there was no air conditioning) one was hot, humid, sweaty and trying to eat food was a total turn off. Most of the time the staff seemed agitated or upset, I assumed it was because of the heat. Most of the servers we would have to flag down to get a simple glass of water. Our best server was Manuel, ( he was only around for dinner time) We had 2 choices of a la carte and I was so SHOCKED!!! In the Italian a la carte we decided to have a ceaser salad as a starter. Low and behold we were served 2 lettuce leafs ( yes, whole lettuce leafs) with some creamy sauce and a slice of panini bread that had been toasted ( I guess this was their version of croutons??) and to top it off there was an achovy in the centre of the bread. I was DISGUSTED. (no offense to the people out there that may have liked this) Took over 30 minutes to get someone to help us open our safety box. I called twice once I was put on hold for over 5 minutes and then they hung up on me. I called back and again they put me on hold ( another rep) I got tiered of waiting and then I hang up. We had no water in our lil fridge and 1 day noone came to clean our room ( not good) The only place one can escape from the HUMIDITY and heat is to run to your room and cool of there with your air conditioning. It would def be nice to have another place aside from your bedroom to go sit in and feel so kind of heat relief. The snack bar was just burgers and fries ( although I heard there were fries I never did manage to eat any cause there was never enough!!!!!) The pizza was tasty. It would have been tastier if the food wasnt boiling hot (since it was just sitting outside). I decieded to have strawberry daquiris to cool off. I noticed there was either too much ICE and it didnt taste right or it was too sweet and didnt taste anything like the drink. my partner order a long Island Ice tea and it was just PURE alcohol. Just gross. There were NO straws with any drinks they either said they had ran out, then I heard that it was an ECO hotel and so and so. Surprisingly enough when they tried to sell us a \"vacation VIP\" pacakage they gave me a coke with a straw. So I guess all the straws go to the VIP guests! ( SUCKS) BEWARE of eating the food outside on Mexican Night, My partner and I ( and other guest) encounter food poisioning!!!! I guess it was exposed to heat for too long. In the bedroom there were a bunch of tiny tiny lil ants. Be careful to leave open suitcases or any snacks around. The hotel def needs a FACELIFT if it wants to come close to a 4 star. maybe tell their workers to be a little nicer and offer them some AC so they arent so misarble when serrving guest. Overall our stay was just ok. Like I said previouslly the only thing good was the beach. who go. Remember NO Air Conditioning anywhere but the 1 a la carte restaurant and YOUR bedroom!!! Lastly the night life SUCKED!!!! nothing to do. The show ends around 10pm. their \"disco\" is about the size of my living room with a pool table. the hotel offers to take you to town to some discos in town for 50 US dollars per person!!! Coco bongo... mmmm.... $50 dollars each??? I felt it was TOO steep!!

The buffet lacked imagination and flavor. It was very difficult for our vegetarian to find even rice dishes that did not have meat in them. Staff really does not care about your well being. Most requests were met with attitude and rarely a smile. They had my sons name down incorrectly and even when I told them it was wrong, he continued to get notes addressed to Carmen. We reserved one room with two beds for our sons and they were given a room with one king bed. The staff acted quite put out that two teenagers would not want to sleep in the same bed. They finally brought a twin bed up to their room for the night and did switch them the next day. We chose this resort because they were supposed to have an onsite dive operation - 4 boats leaving at various times during the day. I am SO glad we did not book our trip inclusive of the diving because this resort DOES NOT HAVE A DIVE SHOP. Or so we were told by the front desk staff. We were told to contact the Tour Desk. We did and we booked a dive through an \"in town\" dive shop. The Tour Desk charged us $70 per person inclusive of a $5 taxi ride each way. At the dive shop, the trip was listed as costing $55. DO NOT USE THE TOUR DESK for diving. Later, we discovered that there is actually an onsite dive concession - Barracuda. However, they do not actually have a boat at the resort and you would need to get to their dive shop elsewhere - also the boats do not leave 4 times a day. You can only get on a 2 tank boat in the morning. Our first room did not have working air conditioning. Our second room had air but it was loud and rattled. In fact, besides your room, the only air conditioned area is \"The Italian\", one of the reservation only restaurants. This resort REALLY needs a place where guests can gather that has air conditioning. We ended up congregating in each other's rooms because it was the only place to escape the heat. Most of our party of 16 got some form of \"Montezuma's Revenge\" leading us to conclude not all the water is filtered. The resort does provide bottled water in the room each day. You are not supposed to put paper in the toilets and some reviewers have commented on this - rest assured this is common practice almost everywhere else we visited including Xel-Ha, every public bathroom, dive shops and restaurants in both Playa del Carmen and Cozumel. The sanitation systems in this area do not handle paper of any kind. The beds were hard as the concrete platforms that the mattresses are on. They did put a layer of egg crate foam on top of the mattress but it did not really help. The maid washed out our glasses and coffee cups each day and put them back in the room. I watched her clean the room one day and she did not bring any cleaning solutions into the room so I am not sure how she actually \"cleaned\" the glasses and cups. The upper floors all have the thatch roof and are vaulted. There are NO DRAWERS in the room, only some shelves - see photo. For me, one of the benefits of staying at the same resort for an entire week is the ability to unpack and stay awhile. We had to live out of our suitcase the entire time. The grounds are beautiful.

Beach - 4 stars this resort is right next door to the Royal Hideaway which is $600 per night We declined their VIP member pitch So on the last night they upgraded us to the Occidental Grand Flamenco Xcarte which was much newer and nicer than this hotel but overwhelming.

But we like the Allegro better it had a better beach and was a lot more quaint , romantic, and chill. We booked our room for $123 a night so at that Price I would stay at either Allegro anytime at the drop of a hat. Now I wouldn't pay over $200 a night I don't think it's worth that much. We also went Scuba diving at Chankanaab its great for beginners, if you go, go to the second hut (second of 4)and ask for Eduardo he's a master diver and give a great beginners lesson. It was my wife's first time and she loved it she was scared at first but thoroughly enjoyed it.

One of our group had a bat come in and fall in her pillow early in the morning - needless to say she changed rooms to a bottom floor, then had enough and left the hotel completely. The top floor rooms all had a musty smell. This disco also had a thatch roof was an extremely musty smell - so bad I only stayed in there about 10 minutes. Truly the thatch roofs should be for appearance only - they don't keep the rain out and they are a health hazard with respects to mold!

There were 2 leaks in the bathroom area right above the sink and after calling the front desk a few times, they sent someone down to fix it. I am not a handy-man by any means, but even a 5 year old child could tell that the guy had no clue what he was doing... needless to say it kept dripping. somehow though, on the 4th of the trip, the drip was fixed. I guess they finally got the hint when we kept using their clean bath towels to wipe the floor with our muddy shoes. The tub also drained poorly, but that too was fixed the same day as our leaky ceiling. Beware - even though our bed was a king, it was pretty much designed for people under 5'10\". I am 6'1\" and had my feet hanging off the edge. Regardless... we took in stride, since all we did was use the room to sleep and shower. It could have been worse. Food/Drink - Read all kinds of horror stories about the food, but we found the buffet and both the Italian and Mexican restaurants to be pretty decent. The buffet food was pretty good with a good mix of food every night. The theme restaurants were also fairly good. Alcohol was watered down, but since it was included, it's quite easy to get drunk if that's your goal. Staff - Front desk people were Ok, but definitely in no rush to help you out. Maids, waiters, bartenders on the other hand would bend over backwards to help you in any way they could. Time-share people got a hold of us on our first day, but after saying no once was enough for them... we weren't bothered again. Ammenities/Activities - We didn't really take part in any group activities at the resort, but it seemed like the staff would always have something planned by the pools every hour. We did get an hour long massage for about $70/person which was not bad. Sorry, but don't have much else to share for this. Guests - Seemed like the majority of the other guests were European or Canadian, and very few Americans. I am an American, and I hate to say it, but the lack of Americans was actually a nice change. Didn't have to deal with too many obnoxious and loud folks acting like they own the place, or complaining and whining about every little thing. Met a few real nice couples who were there to just relax and unwind. Playa del Carmen - The town is very close to the resort (a very short 10-15 minute walk or you can take a taxi for about $4). 5th Avenue, which is the main drag, was nice and pretty much lined with restaurants and shops. Plenty of Souvenir shops around, so take a look around before you buy something... chances are that you will pay less money if you walk a few stores down. The Ferry to Cozumel is nice (approx $11 one way), but it does get packed, so be sure to get there at least 30 minutes before your departure time. Cab drivers were pleasant and fluent in English. We wanted to immerse ourselves in the culture and found the people to be very helpful. There are a lot of small \"hole in the wall\" restaurants that I would recommend over any of the more popular restaurants on the 5th ave strip. Do yourself a favor and take the time to walk around town... The Mexico you read and hear about in the media, does not exist where we were... not saying there aren't some sketchy places, but we never felt out of place or threatened. Surrounding Area - Tulum and Chichen Itza are definite must do's. We have traveled the world and taken in some really cool places, but this definitely blew my mind. If you plan on going, check out InfoCenter tours (they have a store front on 5th avenue). We paid $49/person that included transportation (they picked us up at our hotel), tickets/guided tour of Chichen, lunch, a stop at the Ik Kil Cenote, and a stop over at an old Catholic church (circa 15th century)... pretty cool. This is an entire day activity, so don't plan anything else on the day you go. Lots of other stuff to do around the area, all within a 15-20 minute drive from the resort. All in all, our trip was great, minus the few negatives at the resort. Go with an open mind, read the reviews, but formulate your opinions. If you want a 5 star resort, this is definitely not your place. If you have an open mind and can look past a few minor nuisances, then you will enjoy yourself. There are a lot of other great resorts surrounding in the area... some around the same price and quality and some that will blow Allegro out of the water. Do yourself a favor though.... go explore the area and don't spend all your time in the resort...where ever you end up staying. This place and the people are amazing!

FYI: We are a pretty well traveled couple in our mid 50\u2019s who have been to numerous resorts in Mexico. We have also been to the Allegro Playacar 8 years ago. Believe what the most recent reviewers have to say. Your money will be best spent elsewhere. First off this \u201cresort\u201d is over 40 years old and shows signs of its age. The grounds are very nice, but the condition of the buildings and their infrastructure is dreadful. We had to change rooms 3 times before we got one that had a properly functioning air conditioner. After 2 days of nothing but excuses we told the front desk staff (pleasantly but firmly) to either find us a room that had a working a/c or send us to a hotel that did. Amazingly, they immediately came up with two keys and had two rooms to show us that actually had working air conditioning. After speaking with numerous other guests, it seems that the hotel staff plays a form of musical chairs with the rooms that have working air conditioning. The people that complain the most get the rooms that are cool. This isn\u2019t my idea of a relaxing vacation. The staff is great (especially considering what they have to work with) but the food is below average and repetitious. The ala carte restaurants have a very limited menu and they use the same one everyday. The house wine is hideous. Hey\u2026 but guess what\u2026 they\u2019ll sell you some drinkable wine for an extra charge. Go to the Mega or Chadraui stores and bring in your own. The alcohol is watered down. The beer being served is Corona on tap and it\u2019s weaker than the 3.2 beer I drank when I lived in Kansas. The food and drinks are mediocre at best. Unless you get a screaming, incredible, I can\u2019t believe how cheap it was deal to stay at the Allegro Playacar, your money will be best spent elsewhere. And that\u2019s the sad truth. P.S.

This hotel is very small do not be fooled by the pictures. Not a lot to do with kids. 13. The TV is very old and small. (looks like the 60.s) There were just about 2 cable channels. 14. I had bad fish at the Mexican restaurant. 15. Bed and pillows very uncomfortable. weather It rained for fours days due to tropical storm Alex so we were stuck in the small smelly room.

When we got to our room we immediately asked for a transfer as we had a problem with the beds. We were moved the following afternoon. In the second room they had to remove the safe twice as we had problems with this, had problems with the key card, and the air conditioning, although working, was very poor. We put up with this until it rained, and the thatched roof leaked all over the bed. We reported this, and although they said it would be fixed nothing was done, and we slept with our bins on the bed to catch the rain water. Then came the tropical storms, and after another 3 days we had run out of bins the bed was soaked, and it wasn't until we stood in the lobby and refused to move until we were moved we were transferred to another room. Again we packed and unpacked wasting more time, and the following day, as it was still raining, decided to catch up on some shopping. We got back from the shops looking forward to a shower to freshen up, only to find that whilst we were away from our room, our shower had been used, all of our towels were on the floor, wet and in a pool of water, and whoever had used our shower also helped themselves to our toiletries. According to the manager, they had not given the key to anyone to use as a courtesy room, and just 'couldn't understand how anyone could have got in there'?? We certainly could given the attitudes and service (or lack of) from the staff. The rooms were dated, and in need of upgrading. We managed to get into the air-conditioned part of the restaurant on most evenings, but this was more like a canteen than a restaurant. The food was never hot, occasionally warm, but mostly cold, and often the trays were empty, as were not replenished regularly. The service in the restaurants was appauling, in fact you only got any kind of service if you shouted loud enough. I was only offered coffee twice at breakfast during a 2 week stay. The pool restaurant was small, and if you wanted lunch before 1.30pm had to fight for a table. Many times we had to eat our lunch at our sunbed on the beach. There were never any glasses available at the soft drinks machine, and often had to wait for the waiter to collect glasses to get a drink. There was only 1 barman at the pool bar, so you always had to queue for your drinks, unless you were female and under 25. The pool bar and restaurant bar closed at 10pm, so after this, the only place you could get a drink was in the nightclub, which had 3 tables, a pool table and a 12ft x 12ft dance floor. Most of the staff had bad attitudes, and offered no kind of service whatsoever. I think they ought to be reminded that we actually paid to stay here, and therefore should be treated accordingly. We are typical Brit's who tend to take things as they come without complaining. However, there were so may things wrong with this place that we felt that we had to share our experience with you, and maybe save you from experiencing the holiday from hell. In case you have already booked this place the good points: Nice Pools, nice gardens and close to the shops. Beach towels are provided, using a card provided by the hotel, but be aware that if you loose your card you will be charged 50USD.

This was our first time staying at an all inclusive resort and we thought it was rather pleasant. All we really did was sit by the beach and drink Corona. If that's all you really want to do then you'd probably like it. Entertainment was silly and seemed like an after thought. The disco was kind of a joke, but that was okay, we were there for the beach. I also wanted to say that I read many reviews complaining about the plastic cups, but I wanted to say that I have worked at a resort before and to ensure the safety of the guests plastic cups are used so that our drunk butts break them leaving it there for someone to step on. I also found that the beer stayed colder in the plastic cups vs. the glasses. The Rooms are kind of designed poorly... I don't need a huge closet space on vacation. Televisions were old, but didn't really care about that since we watched for like 2 hours max. Bed linens a bit rough and old, but it wouldn't keep me from returning. If they would update things a bit such as the entertainment I think the resort would keep people coming back. For example.... * Keep a DJ around by the pool so people can request songs. They have wireless internet so get a laptop set up the sound system and you can download any song people want to hear. * at the stage area forgo the chairs and put in a live band for people to dance to. That seems much more entertaining than watching people impersonate celebrities and then lipsync their songs. *IMPORTANT* I feel very naive for not having researched before leaving about tipping at these resorts. Sure it says tips included, but they are paid like 4 dollars a day! These resorts make millions... Tip your bar staff, servers, and maids. I wish I knew this before we went so that we could have tipped everyday instead of doing it on the last day after seeing people tip that day. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ All in all, No I probably wouldn't recommend this resort as is.

Even though it is an older resort it was clean and very friendly. Stayed over Easter week in villa #35 top floor which are not to sound proof but has a much nicer ambiance.This villa is directly behind the gift shop which was centrally located on the resort. A small resort but still offered all we wanted and needed. Never had an issue finding a lounge chair either by the pool or on the newly rebuilt beach. Drink service was always available and never had to look to far for food or pizza snacks from the buffet breakfast, the pool side lunch buffet which usually was bbqing some seafood to the excellent dinner buffet. Tried the a la carte but prefered the buffet. For dinner they would open the a/c dining lounge and if Encarnatio is your waiter treat him right and you will have a great dining experience. Found the resorts evening entertainment first rate with a small group of very talented dancers.

We stayed for 1 week. I was unsure of what to expect because of the mixed reviews on this site, but also VERY prepared for the negatives. Other than the confusion at the airport everything went smooth - we were immediately approached by multiple people with white shirts and tan pants after we went thru customs. ADVICE: If you already have transportation arranged then walk past them and go directly outside and find your driver. Our transportation service was right outside (Olympus Tours - orange T-shirts) and we were on our way. I can't imagine driving there - very congested and no clear lanes - very glad we arranged for transportation to Playa del Carmen with travel agent! Our room was Ok....not great but it was clean. Took awhile to get used to throwing toilet paper in the trash but wasn\u2019t a big deal \u2013 better than flooding the bathroom! We later figured out it our room was in the perfect location on the resort (Building 25). It was close to both the beach and the lobby - where the breakfast and dinner buffets were located. It was also far enough from the disco and the nightly shows to just barely hear the music but not be a disruption. The walls are thin so we could hear our neighbors if they were talking loud and we tried to keep our voices and TV low when in the room so that we were not bothering others. Also...we were sad that we were on the lower level, BUT it was pouring rain the night we arrived and I had heard those on 2nd floor had leaks in the roofs so it turned out to be a good thing that we were on lower level. Our AC worked wonderfully and we speculated that those on top floor probably had a harder time keeping things cool with those high ceilings so it worked out for us. We walked to where the resorts end one evening and are happy to report that our little stretch of beach was just perfect in comparison. Some resorts allowed people to drag the chairs right up to the water and were way overcrowded. Allegro didn't allow you to pull chairs past a certain point so when we were swimming in the ocean, we didn't have a whole crowd of spectators. Also, Allegro's activity pool appeared to be the only one so close to the beach so you could look right out to the ocean from the pool as well. After checking out the other resorts from the beach, I would have to say that the beach proximity at this resort was the best and we were glad because the beach and the water were what we came for! The staff was exceptional! You would see the same faces from dawn to dusk performing different jobs so these people work really hard. We tipped everyone who served us and that helped.....they would recognize us whether on the beach or at the buffet and service was wonderful. Everyone smiled and said \"Hola\" and we know very little Spanish but tried to order drinks in Spanish and always say \u201cGracias\u201d. Tip: if you don't specify liquor brand, you will get the cheap rot gut stuff, however after tipping staff on the beach, shots of Cuervo and Cervezas would be delivered before asking for more - needless to say our first day we were a little tipsy and enjoyed a full day of sun, beach and swimming in the BEAUTIFUL ocean. FOOD: Not gourmet but a wonderful selection for everyone and wonderful fresh fruits and breads every meal. Personally, I was a little bored with breakfast and am not used to eating 3 meals a day so several days we skipped breakfast, walked down to the Starbuck's at Playa Plaza and were fine until lunch at the pool was served. We ate Pizza and fresh fruit almost every day for lunch except for the two days we went on excursions. The last day, we skipped the pizza and had Mexican and it was very good. Only ate at the Mexican restaurant one night and it was tasty. We ended up cancelling our Italian dinner because there was so much variety at the buffet and we wanted to go to dinner when we felt like it instead of the scheduled times for the 2 restaurants. You did see some leftovers, but there was so much to choose from, I can\u2019t imagine not finding anything you can eat unless you are extremely picky. Fresh fruit at every meal was awesome and I already miss it. Friday night was the outside Mexican Buffet and it was really good. Most days I wished I could try more of the dishes but I just couldn\u2019t eat that much! I enjoyed Oriental and Caribbean buffet nights the most! We took a cab down to 5th Avenue one day and that was an adventure. Two American blond females so we were bombarded by the vendors on the street \u2013 kind of annoying but we had been warned. I would suggest starting farther down 5th Avenue instead of right at the end near the Ferry Dock\u2026they were the worse there and it was hard to take 5 steps without being bothered by vendors or tour guides. We had lunch at 100% Natural and both agree that it was the best meal we had while there. It was a little garden oasis in the middle of 5th Avenue \u2013 we sat upstairs so we could enjoy the garden and the people walking by. We decided to walk back to Playacar, but took a wrong turn and ended up walking thru all the privately owned homes, but also got to see the Mayan ruins scattered throughout so it turned out to be a nice adventure, although it was very hot and we finally found a public beach access to get back to the Allegro. Note to other Newbies\u2026\u2026Playacar is a gated area where the resorts are located so you feel very safe walking the streets and going down to the Plaza where there is a Starbucks for coffee lovers and a little mart for various items\u2026we went down there 3 or 4 times. If you buy with American money, your change is in Pesos so be prepared. My sister was ill one entire day but I never got ill once. She had ordered different food at the Mexican restaurant on the resort but other than that night, we ate the same things. Also\u2026she forgot one day and rinsed her toothbrush in the tap water \u2013 I brushed and rinsed my toothbrush in bottled water and never felt ill so be safe and brush/rinse with bottled water only. We left tips and gifts for housekeeping each day with a note that said \u201cMas agua por favor \u2013 Gracias\u201d (More water please, thank you!) and received 5 new bottles of cold water in our little fridge everyday. You could also find water dispensers to fill up your bottles at the pool bar and in the morning where they had a little continental breakfast station down by the pizza bar each morning. Thanks to the tips on this site, we brought extra hangers, our own beach towels, hats and plenty of sunscreen. Our faces got a little burnt one day on the F1 Offshore Explorer excursion, but we think that was mainly due to being sprayed in the face with salt water. Even though signs say not to reserve beach umbrellas \u2013 everyone did anyway so if you plan on spending the day at the beach, go out early and put towels on the chairs with umbrellas. Not sure I could have spent all day on the beach without the shade of those umbrellas. WARNINGS: the beds are very hard \u2013 which was the worse part for me. I spent a lot of time when at our room laying in the hammock outside instead! Also\u2026.massage people on the beach are annoying and we found the prices they were offering to be way too high for Mexico so we even turned down the free 10 minute massages they were offering. I was going to get a massage, but it was set up right next to the activity pool and didn\u2019t feel like having a hoard of people watching or listening to techno music or the activity announcers while getting a massage \u2013 didn\u2019t seem very relaxing. Also, I got eaten alive by mosquitoes on the very last night we were there \u2013 bites started appearing AFTER I got home yesterday and were very small but itchy. Took a shower, applied tons of Aloe Vera gel and today they are much better. Glad it was our last day or I would have been miserable so take some bug wipes or spray with you just in case! Timeshare people were nice but didn\u2019t bother us too much because we were 2 women \u2013 couples and families seemed to get bothered more. If you love the beach and water \u2013 this is the place for you. Spent many hours on the beach or at the quieter pool and it was just lovely and relaxing. Hard to go from the go-go-go lifestyle to so much free time but we got into it more towards the end of the trip and it was worth the price we paid for sure!!!! We planned excursions online before going\u2026should have waited and price shopped so if you want to go to excursions, you might want to shop online for idea of prices and then see what they offer when you get there. Prices were all different. Oh\u2026one more thing! Our safe had an issue the day before we left \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t open. Staff was there in 5 minutes and after not being able to fix it, they removed it, opened it from the back (with much trouble \u2013 which was good to know) let us retrieve our items and installed a new safe. All very quickly and politely. Say \u201cHola\u201d to Santiago at the front desk and Jacabo ('Okey Dokey' waiter). So many others we just loved but Santiago and Jacabo stood out! Bottom line: not a 4 or 5 star but VERY beautiful and charming and you really felt like you were in Mexico instead of some huge commercialized resort. The staff and the beautiful beach/water was what made this trip fabulous! Besides Americans and Mexicans, there were lots of Europeans and Canadians so that made it even more fun and interesting.

We were a little apprehensive as there were some pretty bad reviews about this place. But, we knew it was a 3 star going in and we aren't that particular. I would rate the food and service we received as good. The grounds and pool were well maintained., the rooms clean. The Italian place was our best meal, it was spectacular. Great food, great wine, nice atmosphere and cool. While on the subject of cool, the rooms were not. They did have A/C but the humidity was such that the rooms never were comfortable. We kept the windows and doors open much of the time. Still, we were okay....had a great time during our stay. They did approach us on the first day about a complimentary breakfast, when we asked what they would be going over, they would not tell us. \"Just bring a credit card\".....not thanks. They did call our room several times the next day. The bummer of the trip was on the last day. We were told a shuttle would pick us up at 3:00 AM from the resort to take us to Cancun Airport. We were up at 2 and my husband had a bug or food poisoning or something and was still feeling bad along with being sleepy while we packed. On the way to the airport, he discovered he'd left his rings on the ledge above the bed. We immediately called the hotel from the shuttle and they said they could not find them. We've been on the phone with them for two days and still have not gotten a straight answer. Had he seen his rings, he would have immediately put them on. We have been hung up on repeatedly and avoided. They even blocked our number as one of the numbers we were given was a cell phone, I was told this by an International operator. We realize this is not their fault,but they come accross as very dishonest and uncaring. I have called Occidental's Customer Care line and just got a recording.

Well this hotel was allot more then a 3.5 star hotel. The Staff - 5 star and nothing less. The staff on the resort in days knew us all by name and anything we needed they went out of their way to keep us happy. The kids club was great and our girls begged everyday to go. The resort had their own vendors that were polite and were never pushy or pressured you into buying anything. Stop by and say hi to Louise. He went out of his way to let our girls paint their own pottery and fired them for us. Also George in his jewelry shop, what a great guy and will find you anything you need. Tell them both your Canadian friends say Hi. The Food - We are at a 3.5 star guys. No there is no 3 buffets or 5 restaurants to choose from, but the quality was - EXCELLENT. Also all the staff in the kitchen went out of their way to keep our girls happy. Every night was a different theme and we never got bored or ever found that we left hungry. Lunch at the pool was wonderful - GREAT Pizza and ladies in the kitchen were wonderful. Poolside bartenders served wonderful drinks and great guys to sit and joke with. The Resort - Grounds are beautiful. Very quite and well kept. At any time there is plenty of beach chairs or pool chairs and shades to choose from. The resort you can walk from one side to the other in a few minutes. Lots of room to still have your privacy if that is what your looking for. The rooms were great. Clean Clean and let me say it again CLEAN. Yes the resort is a bit older and is working on upgrading but come on people what do you expect for few hundred dollars for a week stay. The cleaning staff was great and everyday had a new towel creature to keep the girls dreaming of what was going to be next. The room walls are bit thin but if this is a problem for you ask for a second story room as they are allot quieter. Loved the hammock and spent some great nights in it. Location - Close enough to walk to Playa but far enough to keep the rif raf away. HAHA Took us about 15 mins to walk to town and would catch a taxi home for 50 peso's. We were in town almost ever night. Shows at hotel were great but love to people watch and what a better place then Playa to do this. I would recommend this place to families and couples.

This is an average mx. three star resort. The people are overall very freindly, very helpfull. Their vacation club people are everpresent but will not bother you if you just explain that it is the worst waste of cash you ever heard of to buy into that sort of stuff. They write you off as a lost cause. The shows are pretty entertaining if you like to watch dancing shows. They are very talented.

Oh and the one common thing I have found in these places ....the bed is as hard as a rock. We asked for a pad. and they brought one very quickly. The aircon. was pretty weak but the fan made it great. We went to tulum 38 usd guided tour awesome place. we also went snorkeling from barracuda co. the reef is dead there but there were lots of fish. I lived in HI. for three years and judge it by what the north shore snorkeling was like. Overall we had a good time. My mother and step father went with us 72 and 69. Their northern maine taste for food is on the bland side so even the most non-spicey stuff they thought was \"wicked spicey\" I thought they tend to be on the bland side just for \"gringos\" I like the spicey mex foods and thought they should have had more of the original stuff. They did have a good variety and we all found some thing to eat every meal. Two meals that week were an outside bbq. Lots of extra work and they seem to take it in stride. The place by the pools had really good burgers and fries and lots of other options. The three month old beach was very impressive. we were there when there was no beach last year (sandos).

They had the beach towels in there. The safe needed to be reset you dial 0 on the phone. Some guy comes and he resets it. You press your code and close it and then you use the same code to open it. Use the shelves and/or suit case folding shelf because the one night i didnt i had little bugs crawling all over it. Which I sprayed with my Deet outdoor bug spray. Luckily, I didnt actually \"pay\" for the chameleon package and was upgraded when we booked. because I really do not know what it gets you? Seriously. Finally on the second day we were able to move to an upper suite. All the rooms have the same bright beautiful colors. but I wanted an upper suite so that I can experience the thatch roofs. You can hear the birds better from the upper suite thats because they are nesting in the roof. But I like that kinda thing. The beach has shells on it and someone playing beach volleyball cut his foot on one of them. it was weird - other resort didn\u2019t have shells. its a long beach, but the half by the water is public so you cant take the yellow covered chairs too close to the water. They need to stay on the resort grounds. You have to go to the neighbouring resort if you want to boogie board, catamaran etc. The bathrooms were always clean. Just a heads up you cant flush toilet paper not even after #2 everything goes into the garbage. Thank goodness they clean your room every day. You are suppose to get goodies in your fridge (chocolate bars etc with two bottles of water) but i think because we didn\u2019t tip enough we only got our water bottles. The concierge desk is perfect for explaining the area and giving you a map. Paula is amazing. They do try to sell you something that\u2019s \"not a time share\"..hah yah right... but i told them i wasn\u2019t interested in even hearing what they had to offer. I didn\u2019t care about a suite by the ocean or a free trip to Cozumel for hearing their deal. Serj was our nolitour tour rep he is French Canadian and was helpful. Although didnt have the cheapest rates but had good rates. for example. you can catch an ADO to Tulum for cheaper than an arrange tour. Its air conditioned and safe. The drink menu at the hotel was excellent and they will make changes for you (cran/soda/vodka). They have Heineken. The food is good. The Mexican al a carte was three FULL courses. Don\u2019t go after a day of drinking. You get a shot of tequila when you enter. And you can put on the hats to take pics if you wish. The Italian al a carte was delicious and they know their fine table manners-which was a nice surprise. The food was excellent. It may have been leftovers from the buffet re-sliced and diced but it tasted excellent and its nice to see the food not wasted. At night you can hear the other resorts PUMPING but our hotels night life died early.. the disco is small, one pool table. One maybe two bartenders...The party people have to leave the grounds by 11pm but you can go with them. The grounds were lovely. Two pools. You put your dirty dishes outside in these neat little carts. There are stray cats, geckos and iguanas. There is a store, you can have interenet. You go into the hotel store and its $1 for 6 mins. Good luck you will need $2 to send one email if you completely hurry. Not much to play as for sports the tennis courts were nice. Beach volleyball tournaments (watch the shells), ping pong, there is water aerobics and soccer. There is a massage booth set up by the pool restaurant but it wasnt for me. Location: The cabs were always outside. If you want peddle bikes you can barder with Hotel Tequilla and see if they will lend you some (for free) but.... if they are full they wont. 450 pesos to XCaret. taxi with other pple. $5 to town $5 to walmart (buy your booze there) 20 minute walk to 5th avenue. In summary, we never got our treats in the fridge that we heard others did (cookies, pop and chocolate bars) which would have been nice on our day trips. We did tip and brought a nice spa package gift set. The place was clean, the staff were nice (one guy in the buffet meowed at me-kind of annoying). Its a great place to relax.

I read through the reviews trying really hard to find the positives but felt very uneasy about this place. We were traveling with 2 other couples who also booked here. When we arrived we were told they were sold out and they were moving us to another hotel for 3 nights. First off, how can this happen to 3 separate bookings not to mention the others we ran into at the other hotel who were also shuffled there because of overbooking. This is a major inconvenience to live out of our suitcases for 3 days knowing we needed to pack up and move again, not to mention the wasted move day checking out and into another hotel so we could not plan any activities. Prior to checking out of the hotel we CONFIRMED with Allegro that our Premium Rooms were indeed available. There is nothing to say except that the manager finally admitted that we were not given Superior rooms and he offered us a robe. Really, a robe to go with the filthy rooms. There were bugs crawling all over the sink and walls and on the pillow of the rock hard bed with the soiled bedspread. Loved the bug with the pinchers. The lizard on the wall was apparently not doing his bug-eating job or perhaps he was just too full. The walls are so thin you can hear your neighbors as if they are in another room in your house. There was only one bottle of water in the mini fridge--that's it, now that is what I call all-inclusive <NOT>! The TV was a small tube TV with poor reception and limitied channels. Another review I read mentioned they had been in better Motel 6 rooms and we have to agree. Now to the food. We went to the buffet and were so grossed out that we ended up picking things we thought might be safe to eat, like bread and a hot dog. The ketcup looked like corn syrup was added to make it go further. The drinks (you need to get them yourself as there was no service that we could find) are served in plastic cups like you would find at a cheap diner and they had no straws. Mine had some left over lipstick on the rim, nice huh. As we sat there arms sticking to the dirty table we tried to keep an open mind and consider the low room rate thinking we should not expect much for the $$ we paid. Problem is that people are mislead by the supposed discount, truly the rate of $227 is the normal rate and could even be lower for this 1 to 2-star hotel. I'm not sure how anyone would like or recommend this place but perhaps they were drunk the entire time or live in worse conditions at home. Thankfully, we checked out of this dump and found another hotel for the remainder of our stay that far exceeded our expectations. Paying only $100 more a night got us a 5-star all-inclusive resort with a 5 diamond award in Playa. Check out The Royal, it's incredible.

The staff were nothing short of amazing. - Conceirge staff Alex and Paula were wonderful and had a knack for knowing who could benefit from the upsell time share and who were not. They realized that we were not a candidate and never gave us the spiel - other conceirge staff were not as intuitive. - Waiters and hostesses and the housekeeping staff go way beyond the call. We were told by Serge (Nolitour Service Rep) that the average person working at the resort makes about 50.00 pesos a day (less than $5.00 Canadian or US). Tipping is very appreciated - take a stack of US $1.00 bills. - The 10 minutes free massage left me wanting more. I should have booked the one hour massage and regret not doing it. Not sure how he spelled his name - but Jose had magic fingers. - The activities staff had endless energy. It was not uncommon to see the staff working as activity staff by day and hostessing at night. They were not pushy and did a great job. The pools and beach were spectacular. - Beware of the other guests running out and throwing towels down to mark their spot and eliminating your chance to sit under one of the umbrellas. We found it frustrating but did not do the same. Be patient and you can find a seat. - The pools were clean and regularly tested - I witnessed this myself. - The beach was immaculate and endless and the water was crystal clear, warm and the most brilliant hue of blue I have ever seen. We swam in the ocean everyday. The rooms were not amazing. - They were in need of a reno but they were exceptionally clean. The mattress was cruel and the thatched roof, while quaint, made it impossible to sleep after 6:00 AM because it sounded like the local birds were inside your room. Set your air conditioner to setting 3 and use the ceiling fan because it will make it less loud and easier to sleep. The housekeeping staff are very creative with the towels and made amazing looking animals and left them on the bed. The food was not amazing. -The food was less than stellar - and if you plan to go to the ala carte restaurants pack some long pants and dress shoes for your husband - because without them you will see the same foods day in and day out at the buffet. - Red wine lovers - do not drink the house wine. I am not sure what it is, but it was not wine. Wal-Mart is not too far to walk to pick up a decent bottle - take a corkscrew with you because you will not find one except if Wal-Mart is not sold out of their 90.00 peso model. - Beer lovers - Corona on tap may have been refreshing because it was cold but not because it tasted great. For beer in a can you are looking at paying - so go to the local Oxxo or Wal-Mart and pay a lot less. Overall you need to remember that if you are paying budget dollars you get what you pay for. If food and beverage and a comfortable mattress are high on your priority list - then don't stay at the Allegro - you will need to pay more to get what you need. I believe that in terms of the hotel room and food - we got what we paid for. In terms of the staff - we got far more than we paid for. I personally would not stay again because I love food and wine and a comfortable mattress.

On our return to the Occidental we were put in a disgusting room in the middle of the complex and not the oceanview superior deluxe room we had paid for. The room was dirty, had a broken mirror, badly discoloured and chipped paintwork, ceiling panels loose and dislodged over the basin area, faulty light switch that had to be hit 6 or 7 times to make it stay on and a bath that you would have been dirtier after bathing if you had used it. The mini bar was supposedly fully stocked but had only 2 x 500 mm bottles of water. The concierge who was showing us around the room sneaked off when the bell boy arrived with our suitcases.

We have both been to Mexico numerous times and this place was absolutely terrific. It was immaculately maintained and extremely clean, the service was always friendly, the beach was lovely and the entertainment was terrific. There was a eclectic mix of nationalities staying at the hotel which made it more interesting. The hotel was casual and fun and although not luxurious, was everything we wanted for a fun and relaxing vacation. Remember, this is Mexico, not Canada or the USA and things are not the same as they are at home, so don't expect them to be the same. The rooms are palapa huts with 8 hotel rooms per hut. If you have a room on the top floor, you get an extremely high ceiling. There is a fan and air con, but we often just left the windows open at night and used the fan. The room was always cleaned and re-stocked and although not huge, had everything we needed. Sure the beds are a bit hard, but this tends to be typical for Mexico. On each balcony or patio is a hammock for you to relax in. We could hear the waves from the beach some nights. We tipped the maid at the end of the stay, but also 1/2 way through our stay. The property is not one of those huge properties where you need a golf cart to get from one end to the other. It is the perfect size. There are two pools, one close to the beach which is where all the entertainment is and one a bit further away which tends to be quieter. The entertainment staff worked extremely hard and long hours and were tons of fun and had so much energy. Each night they put on a great show. Sometimes there were dancers and singers and sometimes they had a variety kind of show. One night I went back to my room and realized that my stomach hurt from laughing so much at the show. There was always a lot to choose from at the buffets---breakfast is the best, but try the Italian restaurant, just make reservations the night before. We found the waiters at the resort were incredibly friendly and kind but were dismayed to notice how many other guests basically ignored the service staff and definitely didn't leave any tips. We enjoy chatting with the staff and always go out of our way to be friendly and low maintenance and we always got great service in return. I might suggest you bring your own mug or thermal cup with you and use it during the day when you are lounging around the pool. We would just go up and re-fill our mugs with pop and the pop dispenser and didn't have to bother a waiter or bartender and we also didn't have to go and get a new glass each time. The barbeque at lunch was really great---and smelled so yummy. We walked intp Playa del Carmen a few times---you go to the end of the hotel driveway and turn left and keep on walking for about 20 to 25 minutes---mostly through a residential neighbourhood and you end up in the town of Playa del Carmen. It is worth going to at least once. Btw, it is better to exchange your money here than at the hotel which tends to have a slightly lower exchange rate. We would definitely go back to the Allegro Playacar and would recommend it for others who want a relaxing and fun vacation and who don't need the height of luxury when they travel.

Our rooms were fine, nothing fancy but we didn't spend alot of time in the room. On the reviews you heard alot of complaining about the noise, honestly we didn't have any problem with noise. There are two pools, one considered the quiet one where families hangout and the other one where you see more teenagers playing water pole etc. We were there for a relaxing vacation and hungout at the quiet pool and found it very enjoyable. The 17 year olds hungout at the busy pool and had a blast, they loved the pizza and hamburgers served by the pool. The entertainment in the evening....this is something my wife didn't enjoy. She complained that the resort was family oriented and felt that the girls costumes were a little to revealing. They were strutting their g-strings under their costumes for everyone to see. I myself really enjoyed watching them so much so that I left my wife in the room to go watch them. The timeshare people that everyone keeps talking about did ask us if we were interested in attending a breakfast and we said no and they never bothered us again during our stay.

Two of us arrived on Saturday; the other 7 arrived on Monday. Before the trip, we had called to request that we all be housed in close proximity and repeated this request when 2 of us checked in on Saturday. On Monday, we were told that they had over-booked the hotel and despite the fact that we had confirmed and paid for our vacation 3 months in advance, 7 of our group were being moved to another hotel. When I stated that they couldn\u2019t just break up our group, they offered to move all of us to the same hotel (I was later told that this meant I voluntarily requested to move...not exactly what I would call it). So we re-packed up our suitcases and went to the Iberostar (which in all fairness was a wonderful 5 star resort). When we arrived at the Iberostar, they did not have rooms ready for us. We waited for another 2 hours for our rooms to be ready and then unpacked again. The problem with the situation was that we were only allowed to stay at the Iberostar for 3 days. We talked to the manager at the Allegro (Miguel) to request he just leave us at the Iberostar for the remainder of our trip to avoid another interruption to our vacation. We had already lost several hours of prime daylight hours on Monday and did not want to lose several more hours again on Thursday. I have to say that Miguel was very unsympathetic to our situation and we felt that he was very rude, but he did offer us travel vouchers for a future stay at the hotel. We responded that we really just did not want to lose any more of our vacation time to repack, move, and unpack AGAIN. He said that this was against their policy since the Allegro was not overbooked on Thursday. We asked to speak to his boss and Miguel told us that his boss was a very busy man and did not have time to speak to us. He took my cell phone number and said he would have his boss call me. We asked to be upgraded to oceanfront rooms upon our return; Miguel said they would do everything in their power to ensure a pleasant stay and they would place us in upgraded rooms if they were available. Miguel assured us they would make sure all of our rooms were cleaned first and would be ready for us to move into by 11:30 when we returned. Every single one of Miguel\u2019s promises turned out to be a lie. On Thursday, we packed up again and moved back to the Allegro. Of course, we had to check out of the Iberostar at noon (the Allegro refused to pay for a late checkout), but the rooms at the Allegro were not ready when we arrived and they did not have upgraded or oceanfront rooms available. Of course, this was Miguel\u2019s day off. We then asked for our travel vouchers and were told that we had already been compensated because they put us at a 5 star hotel (Miguel seemed to forget that he had offered the vouchers after we were already at the Iberostar).

The hotel staff is quite possibly the most rude and unhelpful staff I have ever seen. For instance when I lost my key to my room, I went up to the front desk to ask if they could give me another one. The front desk attendant then proceeded to lie to me saying, \"the machine is broken sorry can you come back in an hour.\" Keep in mind there was not a single person there waiting for help but me. I then told her that it was 12 AM and I need a key to my room. A few seconds later she made me the key. The purpose of a hotel staff is to help the patrons not LIE to them. This happened countless times either from the front desk lying to me saying they would fix my door that broke only a day after being there or my favorite the maintenance guy that stole my money when he was fixing my door because it took 2 hours for them to find a new door lock. This was one of the most miserable experiences of my life . My suggestion to you spend the extra $200 and get a better place then this place. DO NOT GO. Oh and buy the way there internet is a hoax.

We did eat at the Mexican restaurant and did not find it to be all that great, so mostly ate at the buffet. The food at the buffet was good but was nothing spectacular. We actually ate in Playa del Carmen 4 times in order to get some good Mexican food. From the hotel, 5th Avenue was only a 20 minute walk, so we went to town every other day. Lots of action there, so the hotel location was great! Our only complaint would be with the room. We found the closet to be very small and the bathroom was not big enough for two people to be in at the same time unless one was in the shower. The bathroom also lacked any shelves, so there was no place to put your stuff. Other than that, the room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. We decided that the Allegro Playacar was a great value for the money. We have stayed at 6 different resorts in the Playa del Carmen area and this was by far the least expensive.

The reception staff were friendly and helpful. There was a bit of a mix up with our reservations but the problem was resolved quickly. We found the reception staff always smiling and willing to help. The rooms are a little run down but they were passable. The grounds, restraunts, bars and pools were all in good shape. The tv choices were slim. That's not normally a problem but while we were there the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 took place. Oh well always next year. I would suggest a 2'nd floor room as the balconies are a little bigger and more private. The beach was beautiful but for our first week there were no chairs allowed on the beach as they were still putting the finishing touches on it. By the end of our 2 weeks there were palm trees planted, palapas installed, a volleyball net put up and lots of chairs on the beach. They put brand new lounge chairs @ the pool. There was definetly no shortage of chairs. The resort was a short walk from Playa del carmen ( about 20 min ) and well worth it. We ate at Los Comales on 5'th Ave one night. we had the surf and turf for 2. You got 2 8oz filet mignon, 5 lobster tails, 4 large prawns, baked potatoes, veggies, rice and your choice of 2 large margaritas or a bottle of wine for $54 US. We did the Coba ruins tour it was very good. We booked through our Nolitours rep. It cost $110 US each. I would advise to book through Juan Pablo at Lomas tours located at the bottom of the ramp for the buffet restraunt as he was only $69 US. we also did the Corona rally which consisted of 12 ziplines 25 min on dunebuggies and then about a 1/2 hour at the cenote before a lunch of fajitas and coronas. This tour we booked through Juan Pablo for $120 US each. The hotel was offering two 1 hour full body massages for $99. You could have this either out by the beach or at the spa. We opted for an early morning beachside massage. They did an excellent job. I would recommend this to everyone as the beds in the rooms are quite hard and the massage helped loosen things up. All in all it was a good time for the money we paid. The weather was warm but it did rain a couple of days. Most of the guests were respectful but as always there were a few bad apples in the bunch. If you've travelled down south at all you know that there are usually some Canadians who don't speak English that can be quite rude and obnoxious. They certainly tried to ruin our vacation a couple of days. I would recommend this resort as long as your expectations aren't to high. It is well worth the money. What the place lacks in grandeur it makes up for in their employees. If you want to bring home Tequila buy it at the airport. They have a large selection and great prices. people will tell you to buy it at Wal-mart or Mega store but the airport is better.

Request the top floor (they are two-storey, eight suite palapa-style buildings) - if you want to have a better view and more privacy. Negative - your neighbors will hear you well through the paper thin walls. If you are prone to flatulation (loud gas-passing) - you've been forwarned. Also, you won't get away with late-night partying, either in your room or on the balcony. The food was getting repetitious after a few days. Next time, we would change resorts after one week.

So, get up and go for a sunrise walk on the beach - just heavenly. Weather was wonderful, windy at times; beach reclamation was coming along well all along the beach. The taxi to 5th Avenue was $5 and if you walk, about 15 minutes. Don't bother going to Wal-Mart in Playa Del Carmen - it's not what we are used to in Canada, and definitely no deals. Rather go to Soriana's in PDC, its tidy and better prices too. The Nolitours rep was very helpful and available in the lobby for any questions and concerns we had. In fact, the best rep service we have had in all our trips to Mexico. As we like to go to a different resort each time, we would not go back to here again. But, if you get a good deal, try it. It's not a five-star but then we didn't pay for one either. Oh, and don't forget a clock for your bedside, as there wasn't one in the room.

The Occidental Grand Flamenco next to Xcaret has a shuttle service from the beach to your rooms and is a massive property. No thanks! Pool area was always well kept and had plenty of chairs so no need to put towels out at 7:00 am to get a spot. There was a very tiny beach but the hotel said by next year it should be built back up. Nightly entertainment was surprisingly good. The majority of guests are European 25% from Italy, 25% from Germany 25% from the UK and 25% from Canada/US. This property was advertised as a 4 Star and is definately not, but is a solid 3 Star even a 3 plus. There is nothing bad I can say about this property or staff. Just be prepared for a 3 star vacation spot. We got great value for what we paid and defintely consider returning to this property.

Not sure if it was good value but I would probably recommend airport transfer service so you don't have to worry about transportation to/from airport.

Sure. It is old, the rooms could use a refurbishment, the pool bar is a bit understaffed, and the food, while of very good quality, could stand a bit more variety as you are seeing the same things over and over by the end of the week (this didn't stop me from getting the same breakfast every day of the trip). The beach is small and loaded with sandbags to prevent further erosion. If you flush toilet paper, you will clog the toilet eventually. So that having been said, This is not a 4 or 5 star resort, and doesn't pretend to be. The grounds are beautiful. The people who have complained about the \"steep hill\" from the beach to the dining room must be incredibly out of shape, it gains 8 feet in 70 yards, one flight of stairs is much harder work. The TV in the room (gasp) is not a flatscreen hi-def! Dear God! How will we survive? Perhaps by going outside and enjoying the weather! The location is great - a short walk to Playa Del Carmen and all the cool stuff there. The food was very well made and there was a huge selection every day. If you couldn't find something to eat, you must have been blind or so picky that the only acceptable food is a happy meal. You are in Mexico. I think you ought to consider eating some of the mexican options placed before you instead of waiting for the steak and fries. People have complained that the staff wouldn't bring them a drink on the beach or by the pool. carrying a couple of USD singles or a few pesos in your pocket To Insure Prompt Service has an effect similar to placing your right hand directly on the bar all the way from the beach. The most I ever tipped the beach/pool waiters was $3.00 a day, and they were bringing me drinks I never even ordered. Remember folks, just because it says on the website that gratuity is included in your trip doesn't mean that the people who tip $5 a day in the right hands aren't going to get all the service while you sit stewing and waiting for a margarita that will never come. Speaking of service, if you want your teenagers not to drink while you are in Mexico, good luck. Maybe get a henna tattoo on their forehead that says, \"NO ALCOHOL\" If you leave them at home, they'll drink while you are gone anyway. If your kid is 17 and you don't want them drinking, an all-in resort is not the place for them. Good luck at Disneyland. You get what you pay for at this resort. Are there better resorts? Of course there are! That is the nature of a 3 star resort. This resort is a very good 3 star resort. If you want modern rooms, american-style food, 300 channels of cable and a huge beach artificially rebuilt after the hurricane, pay the extra 300 bucks per person per week and go to one of those resorts.

There are two clean warm pools adjacent to the beach; one with volleyball and water aerobics and a larger one which was never too crowded to swim. There was stretching, step aerobics and dance lessons by the pool, pretty lame but still something to do. The food and drinks were good and plentiful. We ate in the Italian restaurant one night and although the presentation was elegant the food wasn't nearly as good as the buffets; if you do use the restaurant we found the only excellent thing on the menu was the shrimp entree. The buffet had a wide selection and the meals hours were long enough that it never felt crowded.The nightly shows were a lot of fun. Our room was near the stage and we were worried but the shows end promptly at or before 11 pm and we never heard noise after that and slept soundly. The crowd was very mixed, from families with young children through singles, couples and up to seniors like ourselves. There was a separate early show for the kids. The grounds were beautifully maintained and there was plenty of lounges available. However the resort was not full so we don't know if gets more crowded in the high season. The room was adequate but the bathroom was pretty beat up and the air conditioning was barely enough but not as cool as we're used to and you need the ceiling fan in addition to the AC to keep it somewhat comfortable.

We always read the trip reports from past guests for the location that we are considering. We feel that this is the best way to prepare for what the place has to offer. Weather it is good, bad, or indifferent. Having said that, let me say that just about all of the reports given for the Occidental Playacar are accurate. There are good things as well as not so good things about this resort. I'll begin with check in. Friendly staff, with moderate English skills. After check in, you will be greeted by a resort employee that will give you a brief tour of the resort. Keep in mind that this person will attemp to enroll you in a Occidental Vacation Club presentation. A \"gift\" will be offered if you participate in the 90 minute sales pitch. This is similar to time share, but with a different concept. My wife and I decided to go along with the offer to hear the presentation. For our time, we were given round trip Cozumel ferry tickets as well as a return shuttle to the airport (value $95 US). Although the Vacation Club offer would be appealing to some travelers, we just said that it wasn't for us. The sales representative simply said OK and sent us on our way. As for the grounds, very beautiful and well maintained. The beach is non existent in front of the resort. However, we took a couple of opportunities to stroll the beach to either side. About 1 mi south of the resort, will be the end of the hotel zone and empty sandy white beach. As for the room, it was a bit dated but clean. This IS Mexico, and there is a musty smell. However, after a while it's not noticable. We had an issue with our shower head on the first day and called the front desk the following morning, and by late afternoon it had not been fixed. I simply took the shower head off, took it to the front desk and said \"I need one of these\". About 30 minutes later, a maintenance guy showed up with a new shower head. The last day of our stay, we noticed that the air conditioner was not blowing cold air. Again, we notified the front desk of the issue around 6 PM. We returned to our room around midnight to discover that the repairs had not been made. I called the front desk again, and a maintenance guy showed up about 10 minutes later. By this time, it was too late to do anything to fix it. We simply opened the windows to the cool sea breeze and slept well. The food is typical all inclusive food. A good all around breakfast, tasty hamburgers and pizza by the pool at lunch, and a variety of dinner buffet options. Reservations are required at the specialty restaraunts a least one day in advance. We chose this resort simply because of a travel agency's incredibly cheap deal, and spent a large amont of our time away from the resort because there are soooo many other things that we enjoy doing around the Rivera Maya. The entertainment staff works hard to keep everyone entertained and we did catch their \"Las Vegas Show\" night and had a great time. Lots of lip syncing and dancing, with some laughs in between. One just has to understand that this is an \"affordable\" type of accomodation. If enter into, not expecting 5 star accomodations, this is a good place to stay.

It was a pleasure to speak with them in our broken Espanol and they always responded in good cheer, with humorous attitudes and instructional assistance. The food was almost always top-notch. Can't say that they know how to do Italian in the restaurant, but that is a minor complaint. We enjoyed fantastic breakfasts every day and terrific dinners every evening. The rooms aren't near Westin quality, but we found ourselves pleasantly oriented by the basic approach of the Allegro. Showers were hot, toilets flushed, towels were renewed, etc. We slept very soundly in our room, which was midway between the lobby and the beach. No noise from the late-night disco. Watch out for that, when booking your room. One major complaint: We were harassed by the Tour Guide Operators, at first. They insisted on drawing us into booking excursions (Xcaret, Xel-HA, etc.) claiming that they had the best prices. Fact is, you pay far less at the entrances of these attractions. A basic entrance to Xcaret, for example, was $79. The people at the hotel want you to pay $99 for the exact same admission. Don't ever book through the tour guides at the hotel. They are there to rip you off. They called us and woke us up at 8am for the first several days of our stay, until we had to tell them to \"back off.\" Very unpleasant. Despite the lack of a deep sandy beach, we very much enjoyed the warm Caribbean waters in front of the Allegro. They have \"Geotubes\" in place, to abate the erosion. One or two of the shows were a bit hokey, but mostly they were very sincere efforts (some of the staff appear in the shows) Often, the entertainers were quite excellent. Kind of a Mexican vaudeville of sorts. Unfortunately on our last evening, we experienced some plumbing difficulties, and were moved to another room. Their infrastructure and systems are a bit aged, but mostly functioned well. There are a few agoutis and iguanas on the property, little creatures which are quite delightful. Lots of mynah birds as well. In all, a terrific vacation and a very good value for the money.

We climbed Ek Balam, swam in the cenote at Dzitnup and had Chichen Itza practically to ourselves at closing. The next day we rode bikes at Coba, swam at Tulum and hit one more cenote. We also booked the Rio Secreto underground river/cave tour from the hotel. We enjoyed the buffets and both of the a la carte restaurants at the hotel. Staff were great. Evening entertainment was fun. We participated in a few poolside activities and enjoyed walking the beach and swimming. If you walk south you can have a gorgeous beach to yourselves with no sandbags. There are ruins to explore on the walk to Playa del Carmen and the taxi ride back is cheap. The only negative comments I have are that the rooms are pretty basic and have some maintenance issues and, what they refer to as the disco is a musty smelling bar with a pool table.

For the price with air, this was a great value. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the grounds are immaculate. We had a top floor unit that was a perfect distance from the beach and pool area - room 3214. It only rained one day for about 20 minutes in the late afternoon, and so we never experienced leaks from the palapa roof as mentioned in another review. Our King size bed was extremely comfortable compared to many other beds in hotels we have stayed at in Mexico. The shower / bath area was fine with an adjustable shower head and plenty of hot water. The towels are large and are fine. It was great to have the balcony with the little table and chairs and hammock to sit and chill with cocktails and watch the sun set, and to hang our suits out to dry each evening. We unplugged our unit telephone immediately upon our arrival, and did not get hassled even once about time shares or anything else. Our last night we requested a wake up call, so plugged the phone back in and were awakened by a cheerful voice at exactly the time we asked. The beach is rather small, but we met a geologist who was doing gps measurements of the area and learned from him that the state will be expanding the entire beach another 30 to 50 meters at the end of 2009. If the beach were larger for our stay, it would have been a nearly perfect experience. The noise from the near by \"activity\" pool could be a bummer at times while laying on the beach, but fortunately the crashing of the waves drowned most of it out or just made it a faint background sound. The food isn't fabulous. Breakfasts were our favorite meal as far as options and quality. We always found something to eat though, and never went hungry. I do not eat beef or pork and was able to make do with other options as there was always chicken and fish or vegetarian pizza, fruit, etc. We ate at the Italian restaurant twice, and enjoyed those dinners the best. The baked goods were very, very good. The ice cream is also quite delicious. 2 of our days we took a taxi to Akumal to snorkel - it cost 600 pesos round trip, so around $50, which we felt was well worth it. The driver will wait for you as long as necessary. Depending on where you go in Akumal, there may be an additional parking lot fee - no big deal. We love snorkeling and so we spent one day with giant green sea turtles that feed and nest in the water and beach area behind the dive shop, which was amazing. The other day we went to a snorkeling lagoon area / park in Akumal called Yal Kuu which was also amazing and cost an additional 110 pesos per person if you are not staying directly in Akumal or are a resident. Again, well worth it. If you are going here you should bring eco friendly sun block, as Akumal is like a snorkeling nature preserve, and they don't allow toxic sun block. We had a wonderful time and met very nice people from all over the world. We did avoid the nightly \"shows\" - not our style - although it looked like they always had a good crowd attending.

We arrived at 2:00 am due to a problem with our flight, so the check in was quiet and fast. No share time sharks that day. In the morning they tried to talk to us but since I had read about them I just firmly told them I would not discuss that. Thanks. I think that was enough since they never tried again with us, but again I didn't use my polite face, sorry. When we got there it was raining, so going to our room was dangerous: we were about to fall for at least 2 times, but we didn't think this through that night. The first room we were given was right in front of the pool in the ground floor (5602) it was fine (with 2 beds, not one how I reserved but ok, no fuss) but being in front of the pool meant a lot of noise and people, it also meant we wouldn't be able to open the curtains during the day... we asked for another room and was given the 3814, not so near the beach but quiet and on the upper floor. This was good until it started to rain (from 8 days, we had 6 days of rain :( ) it seems that the roof can't take heavy rain, you get leaks right away, good thing is that the leaks did not touch our bed (unlike the next room, the Canadian couple there had the leaking right in the bed! they were sent breakfast at their (wet) bed for the inconvenience) but it made the floor wet and dangerous. Almost starting our 4th day there, still with the rain, my companion fell down the stairs because everything gets SO incredibly (really unbelievably) slippery with rain. We had to ask for an ambulance, go to the hospital, spend the night there, etc. I called the hotel from the hospital, asking if they had insurance: the answer was NO !! how can they have no insurance?? outrageous! Anyway, apart from the stress, pain, extra expenses, rib contusions, tour cancellation... that it caused us, when we talk about it with one of the managers (or so) he said the hotel can not bear responsibility for the fall, since they have signs which say it is slippery: well yes, I can read, but reading didn't help my companion not to fall (walking cautiously since everything was so wet from rain). For their bad luck, I'm an architect and know the minimal things they could do to solve this problems at least in stairs. I told the manager this, along with asking them to do something about it, because people staying here are in danger!! (I saw many older people and I'm sure some would not be as lucky with such a fall) I asked for the refund of at least the night we had to spend at the hospital but they said it was not possible. They offered a dinner. A DINNER, it's a joke right? a dinner and we would have to sign something taking away our right to make future complains (like legal ones, I assume).. no way. So the rest of our 4 days we had to stay indoors (of course, I had to ask for yet another room, near the reception and on the ground floor again: funny smell, electricity circuit failing and barely hot shower No.1604) since he was in pain, could not really move much, we missed our tour to Tulum.... sigh... Food was average, they like their salt. After 3-4 days you are tired of it. For lunch I had to go for pizza everyday (which was good enough) and my companion took the hamburgers... not really other good options at that time of the day. Breakfast is good, you can always have an omelet. Espresso is good. Dinner is not so good, but well, you will not starve to death. Of course we took most of our dinners out in Playa del Carmen.. much better. Humberto, a waiter in the breakfast buffet and at lunch near the pools is really a nice guy, he was always really nice to us. The grounds are kept perfectly nice and clean. That's about it. Please if you have other options consider them well. I can't recommend this place, at least until they do something about their stairs and floors, which are not adapted for rain. Sorry.

I was a bit concerned about the negative comments and reviews I read here. I found most of them invalid based on my two weeks holiday at this hotel. We stayed there with my wife my 5 years old daughter and 4 friends. HOTEL,LOCATION: 1,5 km (20 min walk, or take a taxi for a fixed 5 USD / 50 Peso one way) from the very centre of Playa del Carmen. Hotel is located in a cozy villa/rest area with nice environment, nice tropiocal plants etc. Hotel has beautiful and well maintained tropical garden with lots of plants too. CHILDREN: I must say we were very happy with the services of kid's club, Ana took good care of our doughter they made together lots of beautiful handcrafts. Pools are great also for children, they have a swalow part wher our child could play in the water the whole day throug when she was not at the kids club. ROOMS: This hotel is different from other hotels on the hotel line in Playacar. This was the only one which had bungalow like buildings ( 8 rooms in one building, 4 upstairs, two each side, and four downstairs. ). The interior of rooms is simple, but it had all amenities we need on holiday ( clean bathroom, TV with some English channels- but we did not really have time to watch TV, I think we did it only onec during 14 days-, fridge with complimentary mineral waters, safe, aircon, fan, coffe/tea maker,closet.)Daily cleaning, daily change of towels, what we did not really needed.The least time actually a man spends while on holiday in an all inclusive hotel is the hotel room, when we were there only with our eyes closed ( sleeping). We liked the rooms anyway. All rooms has a terrace where you have nice hanging beds to chill out in the afternoon after lunch. Some rooms might not have a view or might be at a location not too good within the hotel, do not worry, for a small tip and smile, front desk will be assisting you with changing to a nicer room as soon as they have one available. FOOD: really excellent, despite of some previous review none of us from the party of 7 had any stomack problems, we all loved the food ( variety, taste and quality ). It is said that tap water is not drinkable, not even for washing your teeth, but I did so and did not have any problem at all. Food is very aboundant, if you want you can eat and drink nearly all day long :) . Amazing service at the poolbar, with kind staff, you can order you all inclusive coctails straight from the pool. Coctails are great!Lunch buffet is served by the pool. Dinner is at the main restaurant also great. There are two a la carte restaurants where booking is necesarry, the regular one was so good, so that we did not hassle with the booking. ACTIVITIES:Amazing! Animation team consist of funny guys doing their best to entertain you almost the whole day. Aerobics,aquagym, salsa lessons, Spanish lessons, water volleyball, crazy game in the pool each afternoon, realy really awsome shows every ninght after dinner at the theatre ( dance shows, magician show, mini disco for kids beforehand ). We really appreciated the free sea kayaks and small sailig catamaran we could rent for free on the beach, we spent very enjoyable hours on the beautiful incredibly green sea. SPORTS: I missed the fitness room, but did not really let it spoil my vacation, since on my everyday morning jogging I run 3 kms to a near by gym where local people do the training it was only like 2 EUR. Aerobics and aqagym is held by animation team members. Hotel has tennis court , basketball ground also. We played beach volleyball every afternoon at the neighbouring hotel's baeach. BEACH: Sea is clean and green, sand is increadibly white.Allegro Occidental does not really have a big beach as sea has flushed away due to hurricans. It has a small beach, but if you walk 40 meters you can find a big one. To get rid of \"geotubes\" (big black whale looking sandbags put along the beach in order to avoid fluishing sand away) you must walk on the beach ( or kayaking - FREE ) 1,5 kms ( towards Tulum ) to the end of the hotels line, there you can really enjoy quiet deserted paradise like private beach with crystal clear water , white sand, and very few people. INTERNET ACCESS: wifi is available in rooms and hotel lobby, even computers are provided in the lobby, but fee is very high in my opinion so we rather went to the nearby (2 min walk) Starbucks where we could have free wifi access in return for buying a hot chocolate, cake or coffee. ( After the first buy you get an access code on your bill, which you can use later too from outside the restaurant , so you don not need buy further coffees the next days, the first code is valid it seems forever :) SPECIAL THANKS TO STAFF MEMBERS WHO MADE US HAVE A LOT OF FUN: Ana from Kid's Club, Stefano,Giovanni,Adan and Ariel from animation team Jorge from front desk Erica and Antonio from restaurant.

We simply said no thanks, not interested and apart from them continually saying hi it was never an issue for us. Check -in took 2 mins and we had a room down near the pools with a sea view which was fab. Sure the room smells musty but in that humidity and with thatched roof what else could you expect?

Beds were harsh but the plentiful alcohol eased that issue. 19hrs a day food and drink available so i cant believe people complain about lack of room service!

Upon arriving at Cancun the rep from Thomas Cook was nowhere to be seen and I had to find her by asking at a desk I was then directed outside to where I eventually found her. I am used to travelling on my own and finding where everything is but if I were not so independent it would be quite daunting to arrive in another country with absolutely no directions as to where to go to pick up my coach for my resort. Once on the coach no check was made to make sure everyone was on board that should be. We were all handed out a Welcome Pack which had nothing in it except information about who she was and what time the Welcome Meeting was \u2013 there is no way you could describe this as a Welcome Pack in a million years. Arriving at the Hotel if you can describe it as such it\u2019s really more of a timeshare complex than a Hotel. I was checked in (the rep Rosa didn\u2019t even come into the hotel with us). I was given a room and told the Bellboy! (Timeshare salesman) would show me to my room. Told me he had a welcome gift for me and would I meet him tomorrow so I said yes. (Don't bother going its a con) I started to unpack and found that the room was swarming with ants they were on the bed, everywhere, the floor was filthy, the covers on the chairs were stained, there was fungus and mould everywhere. I went back to reception and asked to be moved they gave me a choice of 3 rooms and I picked another one out that at least wasn\u2019t as dirty although it had no bath and the shower that was fitted on the wall was for a person no taller that 4ft you needed to sit on the floor to have a shower without having to hold the shower in your hand (not 4*) At least it was cleaner although there was still mould and mildew in the shower and bathroom area \u2013 which is really harmful when you breathe in the spores. Bites are a whole new subject - my bed was crawling with I don\u2019t know what, because I couldn\u2019t actually see what was biting me every morning I woke up with bites around my ankles how do you get bitten when you are covered with bed clothes and you have a mosquito plug in the room, anyway they weren\u2019t mosquito bites more like flees or bed bugs. It may even have been from sitting in the restaurant. Who knows? Although the maids came in every day and changed the sheets I think they just turned them upside down. After spending the first 3 hours of my arrival running around I found the restaurant where I sorted myself out and figured out what the process was regarding meals. I had calamari and salad for dinner. Within an hour I found myself sitting on the toilet feeling extremely unwell thank god for all the medicines I had brought with me. I unpacked yet again and went to sleep. Next morning I felt fine but decided not to eat the fish anymore and stick to food that I could see exactly what I was eating. Breakfast was good until I saw the cats walking around the restaurant, and insects walking along the glass shelves above the food after seeing this I always had an omelette which was made fresh in front of you and fruit or yogurts. I waited 15 mins for a waiter to offer me tea or coffee and when it arrived I wished I hadn\u2019t bothered the hot water was tepid and then had to ask for a teaspoon to add sugar which I always had to do as well as always asking for a spoon to eat my yoghurt these utensils should be laid on the table if it were a 4* that is. This complex is just not a 4* hotel and never will be. The waiters are scruffy and dirty looking and expect tips every day if you don\u2019t give them a tip they ignore you - just wouldn\u2019t happen in a 4* hotel and anyway I already paid for my holiday! Went to meet the friendly bell boy who turned out to be a Timeshare Salesman. The Timeshare salesmen and women were situated just outside the reception area behind a rectangular desk where they sat or stood, you could not walk through reception or go to breakfast or dinner without passing these people who made out you were their best friend in the world and who would not leave you alone for love nor money. It made my stay (and many many others) very uncomfortable. I go on holiday to relax and at this particular time I really needed a holiday. Beach what beach there isn\u2019t a beach it was washed away in 2005 when they were hit by a hurricane. This has happened all along the Playacar Beach and it is still being eroded by the sea despite the massive sandbags that have been put on the beach. Lunch was only served in the Polynesian style hut on by the pool, cooked in a kitchen next door to the toilets which stunk and had no locks on the door. Food should have been available from 12-4pm but the snack bar always seemed to run out of the freshly cooked food by 3pm \u2013 mmm I wonder why! One plus - the pizzeria \u2013 fresh pizzas available from 12-6pm \u2013 this became my dinner they were lovely and edible. I don\u2019t know how they have the gall to say there are 4 bars the only bar open during the day is the pool bar and there aren\u2019t 4 bars only 3 and the Crystal bar is only open from 6-10pm (although this isn\u2019t open when dinner is served al fresco) There is only one other bar and that is open from 6pm \u2013 1pm, where at 11pm snacks are available. The food is brought out in what I can only describe as giant BBQ kettles \u2013 the food whenever I tried some was always cold as was a lot of the food at lunch time. What I did notice was that it looked like they were using leftovers from the night before both for breakfast and lunch dishes of course I can't prove this. Relaxing time sitting by the pool not a chance in hell - \u201cyou want a massage lady free 10 minutes\u201d every day maybe 2 3 times a day. If I want a massage I\u2019ll book one. Although I wouldn\u2019t bother here as the Spa is a room about 12ft square. No way could you describe this as a Spa. The pool, dirty, scum floating around on the top and all round the edges full of dead insects- broken cracked tiles everywhere, dead bird floating around in one of the outlets of the pool for 3 days before the General Manager finally did something about it and that was only because an American who owned a timeshare complained so much.

This resort is definately not a 5 star but has enough strong points to make it a great vacation, especially for the awesome deal we got!! We arrived early before it was check in time and our room was already ready for us and we were able to start using the resort right away. We had originally booked a single king bed but got two double beds. I called the front desk and they said that they were booked for the night but would have a new room for us in the AM. After exploring the grounds a little, we realized that we actually had a great location (room 5702) right near the two pools, the beach, and the pool bar so we decided to drop the issue and kept the room given to us. The room was cozy but the shower could have used a little help. A couple dollars left for the the cleaning people goes a long way....everyday our room was cleaned spotless, fridge refilled with water, and beautiful towel animals on the bed. The only downfall was the pretty steep hill that we must have walked up a million times to get to dinner, lobby, other bars, and the show. We just considered it good exercise to work off all the food and alcohol we consumed! Plumbing was an issue....it sucks! There is a sign on the bathroom wall telling you not to throw \"paper\" down the toilet. Yes, this means toilet paper everyone! I know this from personal experience. After a day of flushing toilet paper down there, our toilet became clogged. I called maintenece and they were there very quicky, within 5 minutes. Plunging didnt work and they asked us to leave the room so they could replace the whole toilet! Food was pretty good. Lots to choose from at any time of the day. Breakfast and dinner are served in the buffet upstairs from the lobby and lunch is served by the pool. They even have a midnight snack from 11-1am. There are also two restaurants that require reservations....good luck! We had a reservation for each and were only a half hour late for the Italian restaurant and they wouldnt let us in and said they were booked for the rest of our trip. The next night we made our reservaton at the Mexican restaurant and it was great! They greated us at the door with a shot of sweetened tequila and the meal was excellent! The beach has definately been shortened by the weather which is very sad because what is left of it is beautiful. White sand and crystal clear water! The sandbags kinda sucked and got in the way a little, but I understand why they are there. The staff were great! Not one complaint in this department. Everyone is super friendly and always says hello to you as you walk past them. Meet them once and they remember you for the rest of your trip. Just to mention a coulple are Jorge from the little shop on the walk way. He isnt like the rest of the guys working the shops in Playa....he doesnt try to just get money from you. Luiz from the front desk area was a big help with some of our questions and always pointed us in the right direction. Manuel at the pool bar was a character and always remembered who we were, where we were from, and what we were drinking(again, a couple dollars goes a long way). The fun club staff were pretty good too. They organized some pretty cool activities during the day and were part of the show at night. Overall it was a pretty good place to spend 5 days. The grounds were beautifully kept and everyone always tried their best to keep you happy while you stayed there. If your not looking for anything too spectacular and you are able to get a good deal at this place, its a pretty decent place to stay.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london uk", "Title": "\u201cstay someone else\u201d", "Author": "jsenx", "ReviewID": "UR40454159", "Content": "went to the Allegro wth my wife and 3 chldren 17, 13 and 8years of age. The reception on entry was extremley dissapointing since weve stayed at other hotels in mexico before and they have all had the whow factor. After arguing the point that I do not wish to stay at the hotel when allocated a room furthest away from the beach they gave me the coral suite. The view of this room was amazing and it was the best room in the hotel room 5711. We had the whole top rooms but were disappointed that if this were the best rooms at the hotel then I would definately hated the other rooms.We went in low season but as the other reviews state the sun loungers were gone and did go early. One would have no chance in high season. The rooms at times have little ant like insects everywhere especially on the beds urghhh , aircon isnt the best, the fridge is dated and had only 2 bottles of water one would expect some cold beers and some soft drinks but no chance. The food is very average same every night just postioned differently.Cheap house wine is served but if you ask for something better they expect you to pay for it so much for all inclusive. The hotel is understaffed and the drinks seem water downed or replicated with cheap plonk, The staff really need some attention to staff development. We went into the Riu Palace two doors down just to look around and the staff were very attentive and helpful. The actvities staff were by far the most helpful at the Allegro. There isnt much for children the kids club really didnt do much for my 8year old and the other two were quite bored. Some of the watersports you have to pay for which are free at other hotels. Health and safety where do I start. If your old, disabled or have a walking disorder beware, There is steep walk from the swimming pool area towards the buffet reatuarant and walking down the slope is so dangerous that we witnessed a number of people slip.The walkway from the reception to buffet has another slope which is extremley steep and dangerous which I mentioned to management on several occasions which I felt needed addressing, I,m no slouch or unfit i,m actually extremley fit and energetic but felt sorry for those that were not so. The whole complex needs a revamp and attention. Those people who have reviewed and stated that this place was awesome have never stayed at a decent place and nothing to compare against. This is my 4th trip to mexico with my family and the Allegro is the worst hotel ive stayed at it is no way a 4star it is a 2/3 star at best. The niteclub its a run down bar which no one attends with a few flashing lights and a pool/ billard table with torn cloth and you cant play pool on the table with your kids because the bar doesnt open till late and then kids are not allowed in. OH by the way theres NO room service!!!! The good points fantastic views from the pool and our room. Only go here if you get a cheap deal and want a quick getaway with no frills.

It was a perfect time to go! Low season made our stay enjoyable with little crowds and hot hot sun! My critiques are coming from a 22 year old Canadian traveling with my Mom, just looking for some good relaxing time before the cold winter sets in. Let me warn you so you dont have what happend to us. Everything went very smooth and quickly at the airport, but once you get your bags and go through customs, a welcome host takes you over to what looks like a tour rep. They tell you some information like when and where you get your hotel shuttle, but then they try to sell you good deals on Excursions only if you go to a hotel for an hour and listen to them. DONT BUY INTO IT!!! Its a timeshare, and what we heard even if you do go sometimes they wont give you the deal they promised and you leave just wasting your time. They also do the same thing at the Hotel, which is such a shame because you go to enjoy yourself, not to be bothered everytime you pass by the consierg. But other than that our trip was great!! There were alot of Europeans at this restort. We were told that Playa De Carmen attracts 80% Europeans and 20% North Americans, while Cancun is opposite with 80% Canadian/American and 20% European. Because of this, we found a huge language barrier with other travelers, but its cool to see people from all over the world all sharing a common interest! Our room was halfway between the dinner buffet and the pool/beach. It was a good location. It would have been nice to be closer to the beach but those rooms are usually reserved for VIP (timeshare members) If you have kids, you might want to be far from the theatre because they are pretty loud. The rooms are nice, there is a bit of smell of mildew but we just accounted it for the humidity. The beds are a bit on the hard side, but by the end of the day we were so exhausted it was easy to fall asleep. Theres not much of a sound barrier between the walls and you can hear the blow dryer, TV and phone next door. The food was good but not great. Theres always something to find to fill the belly. I always looked forward to the pizzaria at lunchtime! Lunch is served at the pool, Breakfast and Dinner at the buffet. We did the Mexican ala cart, which was good but they serve SO MUCH FOOD!! Go with an empty belly, we were full by the second coarse!! They offer hair braiding and massage but if you go into Playa Del Carmen you can find a way better price than on the resort. The staff are friendly and helpful. We found the pool bar made the best drinks. The beach is nice, the sandbags are there to keep the rest of the beach from washing away.. they are slippery I'm not sure why people stand on them because I saw many people slip and fall off of them! The water is awesome, no rocks or coral and pure white sand. Theres very few places with shade, so I ended up going down early in the morning to reserve a shaddy spot, and the resort wasnt even full! We enjoyed our stay, it was a cheap last minute deal full of sunshine and tequila!

When I arrived no one bothered with me and I wasn't allowed check in as it was earlier than advertised (even though I had emailed the hotel prior to arrival and was told it would be fine).Other people were being showered wih attention, given drinks and tours.I later realised that these people were being given the vip treatment asthey had purchased someone else's timeshare time and the hotel was eager to sell them a timeshare.This was the downside to the hotel.Everyone kept asking \"Do you want a tour?\"The tour turned into half a day and it is impossible to get away from them without buying.They are so persuasive and 97% of what you are told is crap so stay away from the timeshare guys!

Like most people, we had a terrific holiday. I was concerned when I went through the reviews and saw many really bad reviews along with the mostly favorable ones, so I thought I would post something to address the issues in the bad reviews. 1. the rooms: I have posted the layout of the resort. the rooms are in 58 2-story 8-room huts over a large area. The all-day buffet, the open bar and all the activities are located around the the beachside swimming pool. We ended up in the 2nd level of hut '53' facing away from the sun. This was a perfect location! Our balcony was shaded and the room was cool, but we still had an ocean view from the side and we were close to everything. If you had your mind set on a beach side resort and you ended up in one of the huts several hundred yards from the beach, you won't be happy. I was prepared to pay the $40/day differential (plus if necessary a 'cash donation' to the front desk clerk) to get a beach side room but luckily this wasnt necessary. 2. The beach Although the black 'geotube' sandbags spoil the fantasy of endless white sand, I have posted a picture of the beachfront (the rail is around the pool) . there are breaks in the geotubes where you can swim/play in the waves and bottom is soft sand with no sharp rocks. In the background you can see a guy walking along the retaining wall of hotel on waters edge. On the other side of this hotel is a very long stretch of beach. one morning i walked for an entire hour one-way and could have gone further - very nice and still very beautiful. 3. poolside/ loungers. My wife and I are very fair skinned and despite spf 50 sunblock we burnt to a crisp the first day. The 40 or so palm leave sun umbrellas ('La Palapas') are small and only offer shade to about 60 guests ( who have to 'reserve' them by putting their towel over lounger before 6:30 am and are prepared to fight off poachers all day long) This is not nearly enough shade for a resort that can accommodate 1000 guests. We were lucky in that our shaded balcony was just perfect with its ocean view and ocean breeze. If we didnt have this, I would have gladly spent the 50 peso (about $4.50 US) cab fair to Walmart and bought a cheap beach umbrella. the $40 or so cost would be nothing compared to the cost of the trip and there was always lots of 'full sun' loungers on the resorts beachfront that you could use with your own umbrella without getting into a territorial fight with another sunburnt guest. 4. The Food The main buffet had at least 40 different items. We found the food to be absolutely delicious- if you avoided the 3-4 items that had succumbed to the +100 degree heat. We always found something we liked this wasnt an issue for us. 5. The Bathrooms. Like many places in Mexico, the plumbing system cannot handle toilet paper. You have to put your used toilet paper in the wastebasket beside the toilet. We were used to this and didnt find any noticeable odour. Our room had a 'Lo-flow' toilet that even without toilet paper didnt have the horsepower to properly flush. I discovered if I removed the plastic bag liner from the plastic wastebasket, and filled it with water from the tub, then dumped it in the toilet, it gave a proper flush. If you do this at the first sign of trouble, you will avoid a totally plugged toilet- something you do not want if you have been overeating rich food all week! 6. The TV. our TV was set to pick up 25 satellite channels- all in spanish with occasional in english movie with spanish subtitles. I brought a portable dvd player (actually my laptop) with some movies and TV series on dvd. Our party all-night days are over so we enjoyed this and would recommend it.

Our hostess at the restaurant was named Eva, she was absolutely wonderful, always had a smile for us, spoke and understood english well.

Unfortunately our last night there was also hers.Allegro lost a good asset and wonderful person.If any other hotels reads this they should really think about hiring her.... she's very good. We found the food to be pretty good there was plenty to eat. No need to go hungry here. We thought that Mexican night was the best night for food.mmmmm it was good. But i must say we were satisfied with the food everyday. Our main Complaint about the food was that the food that should of been cold salads/drinks/fruits,were not close to being cold. was little better than lukewarm. maybe its an American thing.

I slept on the couch 5 nights out of 7. had 2 tvs but only 1 worked and not the one in the living room.

There are a lot of sandbags on the beach which doesnt make it look attractive. They have a contract approved to start wrk on the beach next mnth and will take a year to look like it did before the hurrican hit. The rooms need a good refurbishment - there were a lot of scuff marks here and there and just need remodernising but they do have the biggest beds!! There is not a lot of space for your clothes - I brought my own hangers and glad I did as needed them. The rooms all have balconys with a hammock and 2 chairs and a table. And rooms come with a fridge that the maid stocks daily with water and in the room there is tea and coffee making facilities. The maid makes different animals with the towels daily but i dont think they do that great a job at cleaning rooms. There are 2 pools here. One is a lot warmer - and quiet and the other is where the bars are and where the activites during the day take place. There are huts where you get your towels from daily - you can change these halfway through the day too for clean ones. opens about 0830 till about 1800. Near this hut is another hut where you can book excursions and good value for money if you dont want to go through your tour operator. You can also haggle with the price. The pools could do with sprucing up - there are tiles missing and just doesnt seem clean. The tables near the sunbeds are never wiped down and sunloungers could do with a clean from time to time. The entertainment team are good during day - they do origami, spanish lessons, yoga, aqua aerobics, volley ball, water polo,drinking competitons etc etc. Stephano and Victor are great! The shows they do at night are not that great but are ok to pass an hour from 2100-2200. They have a disco room that is open after the shows and the outdoor bars are open till late. The main buffet restaurant for breakfast is brilliant - lots of choice and they make up fresh eggs for you - i never had one but were told they were nice. Lots of fresh fruit and yogurts, croissaints, breads, cereals etc etc aswell as a cooked breakfast or last nights dinner if you fancied it. Lunch is served by the activity pool - they do a bbq daily of burgers chips, hot dogs, bbq'd fresh fish and meat and they also do selection of hot food and cold pasta and salads inside near the bar. There is a themed night every night for dinner, its not great but theres always something for everyone and also plain meat and salads and a pasta station to make up ur own dish. There are 2 a la carte restaurants - the mexican and italian. I never tried the mexican as was told it wasnt great but I'm half italian and loved it there. Very small portions but worth it. You have to make reservation day before you want to go. The gardens in the grounds are lovely and you always see wrkers wrking in them. There is a local shop within the hotel which is reasonably priced and out of hotel and turn left onto main road you will find more shops and little market stands 5 min walk up the road. Theres a pharmacy here and also a bank tochange up money - good rates here 0 dotn change up money at hotel - bad exchange rate. There is a pay phone and cards at reception. Look out for the time share people near reception! we just told them we werent interested but they still didnt leave us alone!! It is very safe to go walking around at night - 5 min taxi ride into play del carmen or 25-30 min walk. Go to Senior fFogs and have a burito they are lush - try not to get stung with a \u00a310 cocktail though. Also Coco bongos in playa is a must also. Smaller than the one in Cancun but amazing all the same. There are people offering free 10 minute massages round the pool - have one they are well worth it and they dont make you buy one if you dont want to.

Room is small with a lack of closet space, but has the basics, bath was there but no plug to use it as a bath. Plenty of hot water for showering, fridge to put drinks or snacks in, doesn't get too cold in there though and is small. Room maids came everyday, change of towels, and they did clean and mop. Food was repetative, but then again, there was not enough of us to make the usual efforts to provide variety. Average food, plenty of selection, probably enjoyed the breakfast the most. Lunch was at the pool bar only, unlike when it is running normally, and the buffet restaurant is also available. They did a barbacue everyday which was enjoyable. Sport facilities were ok, watersports which we didn't do, two tennis courts, basketball, two pool tables-one was unusable due to a big rip in the cloth. Activities on offer during the day, 4 nice people did this, genuinely nice staff. It's up to the individual as to how much they want to get involved with this. They would put a bit of pressure on you to do things, to make up the numbers. Some people would have there arms twisted which is no bad thing, to get some exercise, but if you said 'no' they would not badger you or anything. Depends what kind of a holiday you want, like the shows in the evening, you can participate if you want, or if you find it a bit cheesy or embarrasing do you own thing. Some people don't leave the hotel complex, and chose to join in everything on offer. Right on the beach if that's you thing, as others have said here the beach has lost a lot of sand because of two recent hurricanes. Apparently the sand used to go out a long way, but now not. This just means that you have to walk 50 yards along to get some width in the sand. They have these big sand bank things they call on the sign 'eco tubes' , but no big deal unless it worries you that it is not quite the fantasy beach, water is clear though, beautiful colour as you think of in the Caribbean. Sun is very strong, as I know you would expect in the tropics, but just to remind you. I got caught out on the first day, it was very overcast but still does damage. Watch out until your body gets adjusted to the heat and sun, a few days in I developed prickly heat. Unbearable itching and burning. Rather than going to the doctor that the hotel will phone up for, I went to the 'Red Cross' in Playa del Carman. The on site doctor would have been $110 just to see him and then a lot more for any treatment/medication. Whereas the Red Cross was the same price as the locals pay, say $5! If you have travel iinsurance you could get it back, but why take the risk, the treatment was fine from the Mexican doctor. Admittedly, if it was anything serious you would want the perfect english speaking doctor. Just to warn you, watch out for the timeshare selling, they call it \"vacation club\", less conotations in that term! The sellers make you think they are part of the staff, with the way they dress and by speaking politely- asking how you holiday is going etc. They are employees of the hotel, but timeshare reps, so have other motives. Just be aware of that. They will eventually try to get you to look at a sister hotel down the road and offer a free meal if you listen to the presentation etc. You know the drill! Go if you want to see! Hotel is right next to Playa del Carmen, which is a fun beach/holiday town, a lot of activity along fifth avenue but go down a side street to see the locals and their part of town. Hotel is actually in a gated community, no one had mentioned this on here. Playacar is the name of this, there are maybe 20 big hotels and a few hundred private villas. I guess this makes it safer, although in this part of Mexico, I generally found it safe and relaxed out and about. This strip of coast is very different to other parts of Mexico which I have been to myself. They call this Yucatan area \"Little Miami\" and it is very comfortable and well maintained, like being in the States or Europe in some areas. For day excersions, don't go to Cancun- nothing to see. I was expecting a big holiday place, with a big beach where everyone goes to, a prom with tourist shops and restaurants, people selling things etc. But there was none of this. Two distinct areas of Cancun- hotel zone: full of obviously hotels and there own private beaches and facilities all on one road. On the other side of the road are smart boutique shops, so nothing you haven't seen in the States. The other distinct area is Cancun itself, the town. This is a place for the natives, the Mexicans, and there is nothing in the centre to note, no civic centre or historic sights. Quite a good place for a visit was South from Playa de Carmen, 20 miles down called 'Puerto Adventuras'. This was very upmarket and posh - affluent, gated community, expensive boats and pleasant shops. The highlight was being able to get close to dolphins without paying a penny! They are contained in individual pools, where you can swim with them for a price, but pay nothing to still get quite close. A lot of people go on fishing boats from here, and they are hired for a fee per hour. Quite a good tip if you are into this, is that the money you pay for the boat you can make some or all back if you sell your catch to the restaurants. Makes sense, everyone's a winner! In conclusion, Occidental Allegro is a safe bet, nothing special, nothing terrible. By the way they are renovoating later this year and improving, so see it then! Gardens are spectacular already, look out for the long back iguanas lazing in the sun, they blend into the rocks!", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cNice resort, but nothing fancy\u201d", "Author": "kdub2384", "ReviewID": "UR32577582", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just returned from a 7 day stay at the Allegro. It was my first time in Mexico, his second. We both left with very mixed feelings about the resort. (If I could give a 3 1/2 rating I would have...it was above average, but 4 stars is a little generous). My boyfriend was in the Playa del Carmen area over Christmas/New Years at a different resort, and a common theme of the week was him saying \"at the other resort...\" If you're looking for luxury, book a different resort. Everything here was just kind of simple, which wasn't bad, but in comparison to other resorts we saw walking along the beach, ours was just average. We got an amazing deal though. We found out towards the end of the week that the resort had actually been closed up until a few days before we arrived. With all the flu scare and the low tourist season this seemed to be a common occurrence at other resorts as well. I have a strong feeling this attributed to many of the issues we had with the resort... it just seemed like they were a little out of practice or something. The grounds themselves were great. The rooms are in free standing \"huts\" of 8 rooms each, and every room has a private balcony with a hammock. The resort is set on a slight hill, and has an amazing view of the ocean. If it weren't for the slightly taller resorts on each side, you would feel like you were at a cozy resort in the jungle. The rooms on the other hand could use some updating. Everything was very clean, but the beds and curtains looked a little out of the 70s, and the pillows are not very comfortable at all. Luckily we weren't in the room all that much, and we had a great view of the larger \"bridge pool\", so that made up for it. We found the food service to be just average. The staff at the buffet was unorganized and not all that quick. The food itself was decently good, but don't wait too late to eat or pickings will be slim. One day we waited until 10am to get breakfast (which is from 7-11am). Everything was extremely picked over, and nothing was being refilled. There are two sit down restaurants, the Mexican and the Italian, which require reservations. Both were good and had great staff, but the Italian was by far the best food we ate the entire trip. We had planned to eat their a second night, but unfortunately I had one too many shots of \"pool water\" at the swim up bar and wasn't feeling up to dinner (watch out of that stuff!) On that note, the bar staff is AWESOME! They are not skimpy with the alcohol and are super fast. Margaritas and (good) tequila shorts are in plenty, and they have a well stocked bar of name brand liquors. Just beware of those pool water shots! A few other random notes... the beach isn't huge, but unlike other resorts in the area it's not very rocky, which was nice. They were doing free welcome massages, and the message staff was super nice. I seriously regret not making the time to get a full one. There is little to no night life at the resort. We were exhausted every night and went to bed on the early side, so we didn't care much, but if you want a crazy nightlife, this isn't your place. It's not a very big resort, and was at less than half capacity while we were there. This seemed like the perfect amount of people. What they do when they are full is beyond me, because they hardly seemed set up to handle double the occupancy. We had a great relaxing week, and for a first time trip to Mexico it was great, but in the future I will be looking for a resort with a bit more to offer. However, for the deal we got I can't complain too much. Based on other people's reviews I think they are usually more on top of things, but we must have just been there on an off week.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Relaxing Break\u201d", "Author": "sunbathinsisters", "ReviewID": "UR30363742", "Content": "me and my sister had a fantastic holiday here..gorgeous sunshine everyday we sunbathed from 7.30 am till 6pm..if it rains its brief and welcomed!!

I am not sure what people are expecting but this place had everything anyone would want. The food you could always find something good to eat and lots of it. I never ate at the two other resturants because I was always to full, maybe next time. Very close to Playa walked every night to town good way to exercise the booze off!! The staff were excellent!!! I guess the only complaint which isn't much would be yes the rooms do need upgrading but they were so very clean and you only are in your rooms for a short time sleep change maybe a nap. I also read about all the bad time share people I never once had anyone at the resort talk to me about timeshare, the only place was in town so I don't know what all those people were talking about???

I did and was anxious to see what I paid for in a negative way and I was quite suprised. This is my husband and I's third time to Playa/Cancun area and we have stayed at the mega resorts and paid almost triple what we paid here and we thoughourly enjoyed this resort better for several reasons: 1. Its smaller and more quaint. I like the bungalow style vs. the marble-mall like styles. You get to know the staff very well and they were GREAT!! Very friendly! The VIP personalle was excellent (Hi- Jorge, Israel, and Yolanda!) , 2. The room is a little smaller than the mega with just a room with a bed, TV , and bathroom area with closet area. This is the standard room but they're are bigger rooms available such as studios. But like the others say, how long are you in the room? It was just perfect for what we needed. I loved the hammocks on the deck....nice to relax in at the end of a long day in the sun. I liked them..more authentic in my opinion. 3. The pools- one quite and one activity pool with the pool bar. Both were great! We enjoyed the activity pool more. 4. The Beach- first of all, any beach that you go to in this area is erroted from the hurricanes. There is no perfect beach but it is still beautiful. The other resorts we stayed at had no beach what so ever. This resort had beach and you could get in the ocean, no problem, It is gorgeous. If you walk down the beach each way there are a little better beaches if you prefer. I was in the ocean everyday. 5. The diving..beautfiul..Barracuda and Tortagus (sp?) were awesome. Best diving ever even have dove in Cozumel. There are new reefs in the Playa Del Carmen area so they are much nicer than Cozumel,in my opinion, as everyone goes there. I saw turtles, sting rays, eels, barracuda's, and very colorful fish and coral. Dive with the Barrakuda staff on site at the Allegro (with Wilie or Hugo) as they are very safe and great dive masters. You go on the boat right off shore. Convienent. 6. Food- All inclusive..what else can I say. Not great but does the trick for me. I can get great stuff in the US and I prefer drinks more ..LOL! 7. Overall, great small resort for both families, singles, couples, and everyone we met (which we met ALOT of great people) loved the resort! I will definetly go back! Enjoy!

This resort is very good if you get a very good deal like we did. Do not expect 5 star and do not pay what you would pay for a big fancy resort. If you follow this, you will really enjoy this resort and be very happy with your stay. If you want to be able to explore Playa del Carmen and the rest of the area without feeling guilty about leaving a resort you spent a lot of money on, then I would again recommend this resort. We were off the resort quite a bit and we didn\u2019t feel bad about it because we still only spent about as much as we would have if we had just booked, for example, the Bahia Principe (for a week at the price we saw it going for consistently) and had not done anything but stay on the resort. Details: Rooms Our first room smelled very bad. I forget the number (maybe 50something) but it was right beside the bigger pool with the bridge over it. It was bad enough that we went to the desk and told them before we had even set our stuff up in the room. However, we were moved right away to a new room. We ended up in room 1111. We were happier in this room because it had a king size bed, which we had requested, while the other room had two separate beds. The good things about this room were that we were the first building so we were closest to the reception, buffet, and outside bar, and we could watch the show from our balcony. It was a definite plus that there was a hammock on our balcony to do this from as well. The one complaint I have about the room is the noise at night. We first thought it was the disco on our resort, but we later realized that, while we could hear the bass of the disco from our room, the worst of the noise was coming from the show of the resort next to us. Their show went later than ours and they seemed to have a loud outside party afterwards. The shower in our second room was also not working but a maintenance man came within 15 minutes of our complaint to fix it quickly. Location We just loved the location. The resort is in Playacar which is a residential area very close to the town of Playa del Carmen. It is full of both resorts and very nice houses. There is also a little strip mall sort of thing in Playacar which includes a bank. The prices are higher than those in Playa del Carmen but it is convenient. There is also a bird sanctuary in Playacar which we wanted to go to but we ran out of time. We went into Playa del Carmen 3 times. We walked in because it is only a 15-20 minute walk and the walk is very nice. We then took a cab ride home because we would be tired and that cost 50 pesos. Do not pay in USD because the driver will charge you 5USD and 10 to 1 is not the correct exchange rate. It was posted at 12.5 pesos to 1 USD at the trading booths when we were in town. Another tip is that the cabs do not have meters and you must ask the cost before you get in. Playa del Carmen is just GORGEOUS and I could see myself staying right in town without doing an all inclusive because we felt so safe and there is so much to see and do. You must go in to town if you go to this resort! Beach When we first arrived, there was only one section of beach on one side of the pool. Sometime near the end of the week, they put some more sand in so there was a beach all around the activity pool. So, they have very recently increased the size of the beach. However, it is still a very small beach. This wasn\u2019t too much of a problem for us because when we wanted to lounge we chose to lounge by the pool, and when we wanted to swim in the ocean, we simply walked to the resort next door. You can go to all of the beaches of all the resorts in a row and no one will stop you. There is also an amazing beach in Playa del Carmen so you can use that if you go in to town. However, if it is important to you that you have a nice beach right on your resort with plenty of space for lounge chairs, do not book this resort. Pools There is a bigger quiet pool, and a smaller activity pool. Both pools were very nice and there are three different places to get food between them as well as one bar (with a walk-up side and a swim-up side). The little restaurant is buffet, there is a BBQ area with burgers and hotdogs and such, and then there is a little pizza stand. It was totally unnecessary to go all the way to the buffet for lunch if you were having a lazy tanning day. The activity pool is right beside the ocean and the view is wonderful. Activities Lots of activities happened around the pool. We were only there for the whole day a couple times and we didn\u2019t do too many of the activities but there seemed to be a lot of fun things to do. If you wanted to stay on the resort all day every day you would probably still have things to do all day. There isn't much nightlife at this resort. After the show ends at 10pm, everyone who stays awake hangs out at the outside lounge and sits around and chats. This is a very nice atmosphere but that's really all there is. There is a disco on this resort but the music was far to loud and we never saw more than 4 people in there (probably due to the volume of the music.) Maybe if they would turn it down it would be a nice place to hang out as well. Food There are lots of places to get food all over this resort. All the places by the pool I mentioned are open until about supper time I believe. Sorry I don\u2019t know the exact time. The main buffet is open 7am-10pm. A little snack station is open at the outside lounge from 11pm-1am. I personally found the food to be good in the buffet, and very good in the a la cartes. The Italian a la carte had a very nice atmosphere. The buffet had a different theme every night so if you know you don\u2019t like a certain kind of food, then you should look at the sheet they give you the first day outlining the schedule and book one of the a la cartes for that night. If I was disappointed with anything it would be the eggs. I don\u2019t eat meat so I pretty much relied on these for my breakfast protein every day and they were really watery. It wasn\u2019t that nice. Everything else I can remember was good and there was a ton of variety. My boyfriend had various chicken dishes, and the meat lasagna on Italian night and he seemed to enjoy it all. He doesn\u2019t really do seafood though so we don\u2019t have an opinion on it all. They had an 8 person mariachi band in the buffet on Mexican night and that was a wonderful surprise! Service As I said before, the front end staff responded to our room complaints immediately and they were resolved right away. All the other staff was very friendly and seemed to be happy overall. Poor Felix at the pool bar always had a great attitude even when he was left working it alone and there was a big line. They could use some more pool bar staff more consistently. The guys at the outside lounge bar beside the lobby were great. The woman who is hostess at the buffet was very welcoming and bubbly all the time although she seemed to work 13 hours a day every day we were there. The man who cleaned our room was very understanding when we slept in one day and I had to ask him to wait because I wasn\u2019t finished getting ready. Our room seemed to be cleaned well from what we noticed and he even lined up our shoes in nice little rows and nice little touches like that aside from the towel art. One day we were in a rush and didn\u2019t remove a suitcase from our bed. I felt kind of bad about it but figured maybe he just wouldn\u2019t do the bed but we came back and it was lifted off and placed neatly over a chair and everything was all done. We tipped $2 a day for the maid and $1 a day in the fridge and, on the last day, our fridge was crammed with 3 waters, 3 pops, and a whole ton of bags of chips and peanuts. (A normal day was 2 waters, 2 pops, 2 bags of chips, 1 of peanuts, sometimes a chocolate bar if we actually used what was in there.) The internet was fast and it cost 2 pesos a minute. We thought this was reasonable as it was right in the lobby and we conveniently checked out email every day. My boyfriend was disappointed by the lack of a gym on site. Excursions We signed up for the following excursions through our Nolitours representative in the lobby. Xel-Ha Full Day $119USD \u2013 This place is amazing. It is a very expensive price but we didn\u2019t want to have to worry about transportation and we just had to visit this park. One day is not even enough. It is a very nice place to snorkel if you are completely inexperienced like me. I felt safe the whole time and the everything was gorgeous. We also paid extra to do the Sea Trek ($45 USD) and it was definitely worth it in our opinion. You walk along the ocean floor with the help of divers and you are surrounded by fish and rays. I don\u2019t think there is any experience like it. You only have to wear the helmet and the rest of your body is completely free in just your bathing suit. Mayan Encounter $120USD \u2013 I will not give you the details of the excursion because you can read them right here. http://www.alltournative.com/tours-products/maya-encounter First of all, I should say the ruins are closed right now as a precaution against the spread of the flu. So, the visit to Coba was excluded from our tour and they gave us a refund of 20USD (in pesos). The excursion overall was a pretty good experience. I\u2019m not sure if it was worth the price, but it was definitely enjoyable and interesting. I would like to say that the zip lining portion only includes one zip line about 10 seconds long in case you are expecting more. What made it most worth going was probably the huge cenote we rappelled into. My boyfriend jumped into it instead and he said that alone was an experience of a lifetime. It was also interesting to see the small Mayan ruins in the jungle, see monkeys in their natural habitat, and eat a very delicious lunch prepared by Mayan women in a Mayan village. We signed up for the club hopping tour but it was canceled due to flu precautions. In conclusion again, this resort is a good deal if you get a good deal. It is nice and the location is great. However, if you need a very nice beach right on your resort and using the beaches at the neighbouring resorts won't do, do not book this resort. Also do not book this resort if you want something 5 star or very fancy.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cgreat value at this location\u201d", "Author": "tklauke2000", "ReviewID": "UR29258705", "Content": "we just returned may 02 from a week at this resort and have nothing but positives despite the beginning of press on the h1n1 outbreak.

Since the entire trip was really inexpensive, my expectations were quite open. We were delighted to have the very best vacation imaginable \u2013 especially at such a low cost. The hotel itself is rather small, but the bonus with that is that you will meet almost every guest at the resort. Also, Playa del Carmen is a pleasant 20-minute walk (or 5-minute cab ride) from this hotel. These were the reasons that made this hotel our vacation-spot of choice. Our room was in the middle of the resort, which I was happy with, as it was not far from anything. The rooms are a little old, and if your room is on the 2nd floor, you will have a thatched roof. (see pictures) Not very efficient, I think, for the air conditioner. The drain in the sink was slow, and a call to the front desk had the problem rectified in short order. The toilet and shower are a separate room from the sink, and the closet area is separate again. (see pictures) The room could use a dresser. Our king size bed had 6 pillows, the mattress was rather firm. A small television is over a bar-size fridge which houses 2 water bottles, snacks of chips, peanuts, and a chocolate bar. The fridge is restocked every day as necessary. The maid will create a towel animal on the bed. Towels are replenished daily, with 2 bath towels, 2 had towels and 2 face clothes. There is a blow dryer for your convenience. There are 2 chairs and a table as well as a hammock on the balcony outside of your room. Our pool towels were delivered to our room, and we exchanged them every day. At the end of the week, we simply left them in the room, no need to turn in a towel card. Our room was non-smoking, as indicated with a sign on the door. The grounds are impeccably maintained, gardeners are working every day. There are 2 pools, with a restaurant/bar in between. The animation team does a great job of getting the guests involved in some extremely fun activities \u2013 stretching and step exercises, water exercise, water polo, water volleyball, learn to make towel animals, bartending class, etc. The most fun was the water-balloon fight in the pool. (see pictures) You can also have your picture taken with a monkey, snake, iguana, birds... the photographer, the exotic animal and an animal handler appear around the pool about 11ish. The beach has been terribly eroded by hurricanes, and I hear it is up to the government to rectify. Sand bags are evident in front of this hotel as well as others along this shoreline (see pictures). The sandbags did not keep vacationers from swimming in the sea. The buffet restaurant is perfect for every meal\u2014with ample selections to satisfy anyone\u2019s appetite. Breakfasts consisted of all kinds of fruits and breads, waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage or turkey sausage, cheese and cold cuts, cereals. You could also have scrambled eggs, an omelet or fried eggs. Dinner had a great display of beef, chicken, pork, fish, seafood dishes, potatoes, rice, veggies (cooked or fresh), fresh breads, 2 different soups each day, typical Mexican dishes as well, more fruit, and scrumptious desserts! Other guests were happy with both a la carte restaurants, \u201cThe Mexican\u201d and \u201cThe Italian\u201d, although we chose not to indulge in the a la cartes. There were 2 nights that the evening meal was outside and the show would start right after dinner \u2013it was lovely. The bartenders made pretty good cocktails \u2013 Pina Colada, Miami Vice, Daiquiris, Cabana, Mojito, Margarita, etc --- all made with a blender. There are very few \u2013 if any \u2013 straws. Take your own. The bartenders were happy to fill your insulated mug. Because the hotel is not overly large, we were able to meet many, many people \u2013 Chris and Bob, Marie and Ronnie, Rachel and Greg, Brian and Kelly, Tony and Grace, Shellee and Sean, Pam and Marty, Diana and Bruno, Tom and Michelle\u2026. I know I\u2019ve missed some names, forgive me. It sure makes for a fun vacation!! Taking everything into consideration, I was quite satisfied with this hotel, and would certainly consider it for our next vacation.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cWISH I WAS BACK THERE...\u201d", "Author": "schatze23", "ReviewID": "UR28697629", "Content": "Just came back and we had a great time.

The grounds are beautiful and the food is pretty good, and I will go as far to say, very good, in the 2 ala carte restaurants, but that is as far as it goes. We were greeted with a welcome \"cocktail\" of juice. I thought a cocktail would have some sort of alcohol in it, but, at least we were given a refreshment. The man who greeted us at the desk then proceded to explain to us that the use of the phone for non-local calls was very expensive. He was adament about this. Is that what we needed to hear on our welcome? He then told us that if we didn't return our towel card, we would be charged $50, and if we lost our room key, it would be $15. I understand that hotels need to keep their guests informed of their expenses, but it was said in such a way at our arrival that we felt like we had already done something wrong! We were then shown to our room by another employee, who was quite pleasant, pointing out the amenities of the property. Our first room had mold on the inside of the drapes and smelled of cigarettes. We said we had requested a non-smoking room, and he said that all the rooms were smoking rooms. He did agree to move us, finally, to another room on the top floor. This room did not have ashtrays, as the last room had, but it still had a bit of a musty, moldy, odor. We left a decent tip for the maid the first night, only to return to a room that had not been cleaned well at all. There was still some toothpaste in the sink and nothing had been wiped down on the vanity or in the bathroom. Also,the used towels that were hanging on the hook in the bathroom were not replaced. Another time we had requested water (4 bottles) and only 2 were left, on the window ledge outside of our room! The beach was COMPLETELY UNSWIMMABLE, due to the sandbags that were used to prevent more erosion. The hotels next door had sandbags, too, but not nearly as many as ours, so each day we walked to the other hotel beaches to swim. The pictures of the beach on the Allegro Playacar website do not reflect the damage to the beach at all. Even though the neighboring hotels had to use sandbags, too, there was much more beach at those hotels and it was easily swimmable. We were lucky that the beaches in Mexico are federal property. There was also a bad smell in one of dining areas (the one off the main buffet dining area...it is a separate enclosed room). It was a musty smell, and we had to stay there for a meal, since there was no other table available. The musty smell made for a most disagreeable meal. The smell was there the entire time we were at the resort, and if we were seated near that area, we made sure that we were not right near the door, where the smell permeated into the main buffet dining room. The other areas of the buffet didn't smell. Don't stop reading yet...I am saving the best for last! There was a PRE-PLANNED POWER OUTAGE that the hotel arranged so they could fix some electrical problems. They didn't inform guests that this was going to happen, but we had heard it second hand through people talking at the pool the day before. On April 9, during breakfast (the one time we had to sit in the musty dining area), the power went out. It was out for 14 hours...and the hotel KNEW this was going to happen. Did they plan in advance for this? NO! They had some paper bags with sand and candles (illuminatee) only halfway up the path at night. We had asked for a flashlight, but they said they only had candles and we had to get them ourselves in the DARK, going down steep stairs from our second floor room. They said they were short-staffed, and could not bring candles to the rooms. They gave us PAPER CUPCAKE HOLDERS to use to put the candles in...PAPER!!! It was extremely dangerous- a fire waiting to happen. The lights (and AC, fan) came on after 11pm. At lunch, they had the restaurant area by the pool open, as there was a generator there. That was planned in advance. Why didn't they plan to make the outage known to the guests in advance and provide safe lighting for us? The show that night was also cancelled, because of the power outage. When I went to ask for some compensation because of the dangerous conditions, a man at the desk said...What? The darkness was dangerous? We also had problems getting to sleep at night. There was loud music coming from the main building until 2 am. In addition, this is the first hotel that would not call and confirm our return airline flight for us. We were told that there would be a $7 a minute fee to use the phone, since Cancun is not a local call. My friend's cell would not dial the 800 number that we had. We crossed our fingers and hoped that our flight back was on time. This hotel did not offer decent service to its clients. I have been to Mexico several times, and was really impressed with the hospitality. In my other visits, hotel staff knew our names, they offered gracious service, there was no problem confirming our flight, the beach was beautiful, and it was a pleasure to stay at a welcoming hotel. Allegro Playacar did just the opposite. There were some staff who did make a good impression, especially the staff in the Mexican and Italian restaurants, and 2 women who worked at the front desk who tried to help us. Perhaps the problems arise from the fact that this hotel is understaffed and the employees are not adequately trained and they are overworked. This was confided to us by an employee who was in the process of relocating to another hotel.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "WCNC", "Title": "\u201cStaff wonderful, hotel needs a little help\u201d", "Author": "Phoebeonthelake", "ReviewID": "UR28441212", "Content": "The staff was friendly and helpfull, they went out of their way to make you feel welcome.

We decided to take the kids (3 & 6) since it boasts a kids club and it was a kid freindly resort. We were greeted fine upon arrival and we were pleased with the location of our building #55(one building away from the water). The beach is prettty much non existent so if you like the beach- do not stay here. The beach is covered by slimy sand bags and it was hard to take my 3 year old in for a dip. The pools were nice but if you wanted a chair you better get up at 5 a.m. to stake your claim with a towel or book because they were all taken by 7:30 regardless of the sign that says- please do not reserve chairs! The lines at the pool bar were long but had your customary drinks. The staff was not overly friendly as we had experienced in the past at other resorts. Be sure to make your reservations immediately if you want to dine at the Italian or Mexican places- if not you are left dining in the dimly lit buffet area where you will see a repeat of foods-just in different forms. The grounds were well kept and the activities staff really got people involved. Now onto the rooms...the beds are absolutely horrible with a mattress on top of a concrete slab. The rooms say they were recently \"renovated\" when I am pretty sure that means a lot of paint and a bad caulking job! I have stayed at nicer motels! The bathroom reaked of sewage more than once and if you were sitting on your veranda you could hear every time your neighbor flushed their toilet- yeah! Our shower curtain was too short to even cover the openings on both sides of the shower so we had constant water all over the floor after showering. You do have a refrigerator in your room with 2 bottles of semi cool water in them as I think our refrigerator had just been turned on upon our arrival. We did miss our initial meeting with the Apple representative due to having 2 small children who could focus on nothing more than swimming after travelling for 4 hours in a plane and an hour on a bus. My husband made 3 more attempts to find an \"apple representative\" who was never found. He had to have the front desk reception call to be sure of our departure arrangements. On our first night there I called to request more pillows- yes I like a lot of pillows and considering there was one per person, I didn't think my request for 4 more pillows, one each for my husband and I and the two other so my 3 year old didn't fall onto terracotta tiles at 3 a.m. was unreasonable....when I asked for the pillows the man on the phone said \"4PILLOWS? What do you need 4 pillows for?\" I'm sorry but I don't even have to explain myself at work let alone explain my self on vacation- I didn't think it was a very extreme request- after 45 minutes a lovely girl showed up with 3 pillows. Guess he told me! The night we made it to the show when both kids could actually stay up that late, it was the special \"surprise Show\" which was basically composed of embarrasing the hell out of 4 very willing participants for the entire show making them do ridiculous activities to gain the crown of \"Miss Allegro\". Although my 6 year old son enjoyed the conga line at the end, I was disppointed because I had heard that the shows were pretty decent. We may have just caught a bad night but it was a Saturday night! After the show, there was a small snack area set up outside the swing bar and our kids wanted a snack so we made them a cheesburger to share. Upon getting back to the room and cutting it in half, it was practically raw inside! Gross! Needless to say, if you want to stay at an occidental resort, this one I would not recommend- I would receommend the Xcaret more as we stayed there June 2008 and this was lovely with good shows, beach and adults only salt water pool. I was also disappointed that there was no where to eat dinner and look at the sea which is always a highlight of any trip I have taken to Mexico.

It was only a short walk (25 mins) or even shorter cab ride (5 mins) to playa del carmen. We went into town twice and felt safe and enjoyed looking at the shops. We absolutely loved this place and had a great experience. The villa that we stayed in was also great. The only complaint would be that the water pressure sucked ... it copped out a few times, but it would come back. Also, you had to pay for internet use which was a bummer. It was about 20 cents a minute though so it\u2019s affordable! The maids were good and our room was always clean. The staff was amazing as they always seemed interested and were quick to serve you drinks. The beach and pools were very nice. The beach was basically non-existent since the sandbags were everywhere. But there were still places to lay in the sun. It just wasn't the prettiest sight, but the water was still wonderful. As well, there was really great entertainment at night. We watched a bunch of different shows - boogie dreams, the magician and others I can't recall now. All were worth the watch. Oh and I'd recommend bringing <b>ear plugs</b>. There were crazy obnoxious birds living outside our room that would wake us up EARLY every day! I brought plugs so I was fine... I know the birds are situational and you have to expect it when you're living in your own little villa, but if you want a little sleep bring them. What was the most important though was that we felt safe and didn't get sick from the food! My boyfriend ventured into the seafood one night though and he did get a tad sickly ... but it didn't last very long. To be careful just stick to what you know. They had a great buffet and seeing as I'm a picky eater I was a bit worried about the selection, but there was something for everyone! Variety of juices, bottled water and food. I was a bit disappointed they only had coconut ice cream. That's just a personal concern though.... haha. We did two tours. We went to Xcaret park and had a great day. It was basically like a zoo, but we also swam in an underground river, which was amazing. When I heard they wanted another $150 to swim with the dolphins I almost choked! I was upset about that considering the admission to the park was $175 cdn. For our other tour we went to see the Coba ruins, a mayan village, zip lined, swam in a cenote, and kayaked. I really enjoyed that excursion except our tour guide, Miguel was a mad man. His driving skills (?) were terrifying. I couldn't really enjoy the scenery because I was scared for my life. We were driving 140km/hr down a winding dirt road with tall jungle on either side of us. A bird ended up smoking the windshield. We also saw goats crossing the road up ahead but he didn't even use caution when we passed them.

You can try your calling card and will be told that the calling card has been denied but they will put the call through with your credit card. DON\"T DO IT! Likewise don't use the pay phones in the lobby. Most major phone companies will have a local phone number you can call which will accept your calling card at resoanable rates. So far I'm on the hook for about $1300 for roughly 16 phone calls, only three of which actually got through and roaming charges on my cell. I was also double billed for the same calls by both the third party provider and the hotel when checking out. You will likely be encouraged by the staff to attend a time share presentation as well. The information the enticement is low key and the staff entice you by suggesting they you will be provided with a tour of the facility and local information and orientation.

Finding a two mile slick of toilet paper and garbage floating by with the current did not make me much feel like swimming in the ocean Food was ok, nothing special and the wine was atrocious. I also found it amazing that that I could consume two or three drinks over the course of an evening or over dinner and not get even a small buzz when the same amount at home would leave me dizzy.

The eco excursions were fantastic and we had a wonderful time when we got out of the resort. Take the ferry to Cozumel and rent a scooter . This is an incredible country for snorkeling some great reef areas and lagoons. Try caving and scuba diving some well layed out underground rivers and cenotes.

We were among the 70 + wedding group. After reading reviews about this resort, we didn't know what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised. It is our first time to Mexico, so we don't have anything to compare the resort to, but we liked the quaintness of the the Allegro. You have the ocean right there as well as the pools. What more could you ask for. Yes the sandbags aren't pretty, but what can you do, Mother Nature is taking its toll on the beach and they are doing their best to save it . It doesn't stop you from taking a dip in the ocean whenever you want! I never heard any complaints about not being able to get a beach chair (but you have to be up early to pick your spot!). The food was great and plentiful, and the food service staff was always cheerful and extremely accomodating. Thanks to Vincente, and Umberto and all the staff. (Those are the names that stand out in my mind, but they were ALL great!) As a matter of fact, you didn't pass any employee anywhere on the property that didn't say \"Ola\" to you. The Allegro is close to a lot of things. Just to name a few, Playa del Carmen was just a short $5.00 cab ride away or a 20 minute walk. The ferry to Cozumel leaves from Playa del Carmen and is only about a half hour ferry ride. The recreation staff at the pool was exceptional and again like the other staff very accomodating. Thank you for the laughs and the volleyball games and other activities, Luis and Ariel! A few suggestions I would have to the hotel would be that they update the furniture in the rooms, put more bartenders on at the pool bar and maybe keep the pool bar open later, and maybe put their menu on a two week rotation. We were there two weeks and noticed that the food was on a weekly rotation and thought that if they put it on a two week rotation, people like us would not have reptition. Not that I am complaining, because like I said before the food was great and plentiful. The wedding was lovely ,but we thought the bar should have stayed open later as it closed down at 10:00 p.m. There were other bars open at the resort, but there were enough people at the wedding to warrant keeping the bar near the reception open.

The food was excellent and plentiful although the drinks seemed watered down (something I'm sure is common with the all inclusives). For the most part, we were very impressed with how hard the staff worked to make things pleasurable for the guests. A small gift for the maid and some cigars for the good waiters guarenteed great service. We always had extra bottles of water in the room and extra Tequila shots at dinner time. Overall, we found it difficult to find much to complain about. Most staff were friendly and helpful. Some very minor issues were being constantly bugged to attend the time share talks and a seemingly difficult time making local calls from the hotel. Often when we asked for information, staff would give us different stories and often didn't really seem to know the answers although they tried hard to assist (seems like the Mexican way).

We were somewhat apprehensive about staying at a resort that was less than 4 1/2 Stars as we had always been warned to avoid these. This was our 4th trip to the Mayan Riviera & we booked 1 week at the Allegro Playacar & 1 week at the Barcelo Maya Colonial. We were quite amazed at the quality of the food, the best we have had at any resort we have ever stayed at. Cudos to the head chef! We only ate at the Buffet however as never had a chance to make it to the a la cartes. (Note: To book the a la cartes you MUST book 1 day in advance). We were not disappointed at all as we were so impressed with the Buffet restaurant. Such variety! Great presentation! The rooms are very basic but we found them to be adequate. TV's are rather antiquated. Though no one goes on a trip like this to sit in your room and watch TV, it would still be nice to be able to get the weather channel. Don't count on it at this resort! Poor reception, bad picture quality and very little channel selection. A dresser would be nice and a FULL shower curtain or shower door would improve matters as well. Yes, the pool water was cold but when we were there they had just had a stretch of cooler weather. As always, it was great once you were in! The pool activities were great and the activities co-ordinators were AWESOME!!! The Beach area is very small but you can walk a long way down passing resort after resort & will eventually come upon open beach. We particularly enjoy walking on the beach and were not disappointed here. We walked 45 minutes in one direction before turning back to head \"home\" and could have gone further. The grounds are beautiful and extremely well maintained. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. More bar service during the daytime would be a good thing. We quite enjoyed the location. It is a 20 min walk to Playa del Carmen in 1 direction & approx a 3 min walk to a fair sized Plaza in the other. This is a very small resort & we found it had a lot more charm than some of the larger resorts we have stayed at.. In summation, would we recommend this resort to others; we already have.

Our expectations were not very high after reading the reviews here, but since my father has timeshare with the Allegro, and he loves it, we decided to give it a try. CHECK IN- smooth for us, but somewhat inconvenient for all of our guests as they had to change rooms after one night. The Hotel was overbooked throughout our stay. At one point we were given the option to transfer to Xcaret 5 Star hotel, all inclusive as well, with free passes to the Xcaret part. WE decided to stay with Allegro after all. STAFF- very friendlly and always smiling, very helpfull and pleasant to deal with all around. GROUNDS- Meticulously maintained and beautifull. ROOMS- Our 2 BR/2BA sweet was fantastic, with a little bar which was refilled promptly and daily with bottled water, and every third day with soda and beer. The other guests of ours stayed at regular rooms and studios (room with a living-room) and they reported the rooms were adequate and comfortable. Overall the hotel needs a facelift as compared to the surrounding ones. But all of our guests enjoyed the homey huts. BATHROOMS- somewhat of a joke with that 1/3 glass cover that is not adjustable, allowing water to run free everywhere. We layed a ton of towels to prevent it from flooding the rest of the bathroom and delt with it. The bathroom itself was very clean with complimentary toileting items, a sawing kit and many others. BEACH- day by day a bit more is eatten up by the sea. At this time there is a strip left enough to enjoy the sun, but you may want to get your spot earlier during the day. And yes, more sand bags are being added to save the little beach that is left. Further down the beach, approx 15 min walk towards the South, there is a fantastic beach, wide and not crowded at all. There is a reef with colorfull fish and crabs, large snails and many more shells to pick from. It is almost secluded. FOOD- Excellent buffet with many different things to chose from ffor each meal. Each day had a theme, ranging from French to International. We also enjoyed twice during our stay outside fiesta, wery well organized with great food veriety. The only complaint I have is the temperature of the food. Although buffet may not be served as hot, I found both restaurants, the Mexican and Italian to be serving room temperature meals. Honestly, the wuality of Italian and Mexican restaurants were surpassed by the buffet. WEDDING- the decorations and set up- by the 7 poles next to the beach, were very beautifull. The reception was fantastic, and the DJ played what we wanted, including our own music we brought in. The food we ordered was Italian, and it was OK, once again rather cool in temp. Wedding cake- excellent. Service- Excellent. Many thanks to the Wedding coordinator. The original wedding coordinator was difficult to keep in touch with and finaly resigned. The new one should get a star for making all the arrnagements in such a short time (2 weeks) and doing such a great job. Thanks to Daisy M. Romantic dinner for the newlyweds- excellent, very good and much higher quality than regular food served at the restaurants! also food presentation was very professional and splendid. We enjoyed it very much. SUPPRISE GIFTS- Appreciated :), the flowes were just amazing! The only small complaint would be just one jaccuzzi for the whole complex which was not working anyway.

I do not spend alot of time in my room when on holiday but when I return to it I would like to be comfortable. No beach to speak of. We had two chairs in the room, both were broken, we had no dresser, all clothes were placed on two shelves, we had a thatched roof that leaked when it rained, there was a hole around the faucet that you could look into, there was a drain hole in the bathroom floor that reeked like sewer, the caulking in the shower was all off. This place needs to renovate before it can call itself a Fourstar Hotel, although in all the brouchures it says it has! If you request a different room you must sit through a 90 minute or more Timeshare speil, and believe me these people are relentless. They jump on you as soon as you walk trough the door.

Gives you preferred rooms, a gift, special seating for some meals. Don't count on it, it was no different than what everyone else gets. The Rooms: older rooms,a little worn but clean and satisfactory. Although if you get an adjoining room, hope it is someone you know-you can hear everything from your neighbours.They might as well be in the same room with you-this really sucked. The thatched roofs are quaint-especially if you have the second floor. The table and chairs as well as the hammocks on every patio or balcony is a nice touch. The Beach: very,very small. Not for beach lovers. No fault of anyone's but the weather, and the hotel is built too close to the ocean. You can't walk out too far and the ocean gets deep fast with a good current. Not good for snorkelling-absolutely nothing to see. The Grounds: lovely, the resort itself is very nice and kept clean. Small, which is nice, nothing is very far away. The Pools: one a swim up bar where all the games were being played and great service at the bar. Fun! the other- no games, a little quieter, but this is also where the young children played. The Food: Italian- small portions for some items and they do seem to love their salt! The mexican-again, small portions but overall very good food. The buffet-you could always find something to eat, but one week of it was long enough. Breakfasts-great!! And the buffet lunches by the pool bar were great. The Staff: we found everyone very friendly, especially the entertainment staff and the waiters and bartenders. Tours: instead of going with our Nolitour rep we were recommended by other vacationers to go with the tour company set up right beside the hotel lobby. Cheaper prices! Great service, great guides! We did a tour to the ruins in Coba, our guide was Sergio, ask for him, so informative! We had our own bus with 10 of us. They catered the trip to our wants. Climbing the ruins in Coba was amazing and so interesting. Also went to a cenote and had a swim-so beautiful, a must see!! Booked an ATV ride and all drove our own. Saw some ruins and swam in a cenote. Fun, fun! We had some scuba divers go on a 2 tank dive to the cenotes. Not your usual dive in the ocean, but the dive master was excelllent and the experience was well worth the intial concerns of diving in an underground body of water in some very dark and cramped spaces. A great experience and the divers were glad they did it. Shopping: went to 5th avenue, lots of stores just like a big city. Small mall a short walk from hotel, lots to choose from. Some will barter, look around first and get some prices to work with. All and all a good holiday. We always enjoy Mexico and have never had trouble with illness.

You have your own patio with table and chairs and a hammock!!! It is clean and the staff are great. I left small tips $2/day... each day and they give you ten star treatment.There was one night where a man was way too drunk; he fell and his head was bleeding, the staff came quickly and took care of him with dignity and respect. The food was awesome with lots of variety. It's hot and very tastey for some who are watching there calorie intake and for someone who isn't!!! I felt very safe.We brought four children with us and I let them do what they wanted because I felt so safe. I would stay there in a heart beat again and again. You are close to a little market; one block to the left, the bank and starbucks. Also you can go to Playa de Carmen (5 minutes away) and to Cozumel; a 30 minute ferrry ride from playa de carmen (great place to shop and snorkel!!!). Do the Mayan Village/ cenote /Chichen Itza tour with George and Noltours; a five star tour.You can stilll climb this pyramid, one of the last few. Bring little gifts (from your culture) for the Mayan children it will be the best tour/reward of your life. The hotel has lots to do (Spanish lessons, dance classes, yoga, water volleyball, water/land aerobics, water sports etc... and the beach is great. The sand is like no other your feet will touch and the water many shades of blue.. There are still a few shells to find. A few sand bags in front of the beach but you can still enjoy it. If you like buying stuff on the beach there is enough of that but they don't hound you if it's not your thing. Parasailing is fun, safe and not expesive at $50 and you can go as many as three at one time. It is the best hotel I have stayed in and I have spent half my life in Mexico. Don't listen to the negativity (nothing can make those people happy) just go and enjoy!!!!

Jose Luis one of the activity personnel has what it takes to get people up out of their lounge chairs and play volleyball, take dancing lessons and/or play games. He obviously loves his job along with Luigi, Elisa and Hilda who are other activity personnel. Jose Luis can be found around the pool or being the emcee at night for the nightly show. My dad was called up on stage New Years night to perform in a skit and Jose Luis made him feel very comfortable and made the audience laugh. Hilda and Elisa were very helpful with my niece age 4 and my nephews ages 8 and 10. This hotel is a great place to take children.

We had friendly staff at the front desk and in the restaurant, food was average, but nothing to rave about, but tolerable. But I had some major issues with the rooms and the timeshare agents constantly hounding you to sit in on their presentation for a vinyl bag and some very cheap tequilla. I was shocked and disappointed at the room size, the cheap decor, the rusty mirrors and hangers, damp smell in the rooms, the awful shape of the terra cotta tile, the dirty grout in the bathroom, the 1/4 shower door, mold and dirty grout in shower stall, the very hard and very gray towels which looked dirty, the cheap bedspreads and linens and I could go on and on, but you get the picture. I wasn't expecting Trump Towers, but when I pay good money for a room I expect it to be clean and presentable. If I'm paying $50.00 a night for a motel room in Wildwood NJ( no offense NJ) I expect it to look like a standard beach motel room, but I don't expect to get that from an Occidental properties at $150-200 a night. It's almost like they put all their remodeling budget into the Vacation Club rooms and said to heck with the average vacationer. The vacation club members pay $12,000 + to be a part of the \" vacation club\" or let's call it what it really is and that's a timeshare, but they seem to get the rooms that are clean with the up to date furniture, comfortable beds and top shelf liquor in the drinks. I think that's why the timeshare reps are located right smack dab in the middle of the hotel lobby, as you exit and head towards your \"room\". If you complain enough, the timeshare rep will come and offer you to get you an upgraded room if you listen to the presentation. Everything about this property was dissappointing and if I didn't have 7 people in my party, I would have cancelled the reservations and found rooms elsewhere. I was ready to come home the minute I walked into that room. I avoided going to the room at all costs, which is too bad because some times you just want to relax and have a romantic evening with our partner or spouse and that didn't happen for me on this trip, as I was so angry from day one of the trip, that it took everything I had get through the 5 days in Playa with a smile on my face, so I wouldn't ruin the vacation for my myself or my loved ones. Based on rooms alone, I would NOT recommend this property to friends or family. I think the lack of care given to keeping the rooms updated and focusing on little details with the painting, tiling, repairs etc.that has been overlooked in all of these rooms make the rooms look very cheap and dirtly. No matter how great a job housekeeping does, the rooms will still feel, smell and look dirty based on the fact that these details have been missed. I know people aren't supposed to spend all their time in the rooms while on vacation, but you still want to shower, change and spend time in a room that is warm and inviting and you won't find that at this property.", "Date": "December 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "gintare", "Title": "\u201cGreat mexico!\u201d", "Author": "gintare29", "ReviewID": "UR21677689", "Content": "Great animacion team, but specially STEFANO!!!!!!!

We went in Dec 2007 with a group of 16 people and had a great time even though it was a little cooler than we expected and the pool water was cold, but not so cold we didn't go in it. We had so much fun that our group wanted to return when it was warmer so we went back in May with a group of 17. We stayed in the First Club section and everyone had lots of fun. No complaints. Our rooms were kept nice and clean and mini bar stocked. The service we had from Sergio in First Club - Outstanding, Abel at the Swim up Bar - Outstanding, the restaurants and the Acitivies Group were all great. It is much more fun if you join in and participate in the activity events. They had everything, water balloon fights, dance lessons, step areobics, arm wrestling, tequilla volleyball, tequilla darts. Everyone is nice, friendly and always smiling. They made sure we were taken care of and had lots of fun. A little tipping goes a long way. We had 2 kids with us, age 7 & 10 and they had a great time too. They went to the Kids Club 1 day, played on the beach, played in the pool, chased lizards and even were allowed to play pool on the pool tables in the dance club on the off hours. The dance club is small but good music and we had lots of fun dancing in there a couple of nights. The shows at the resort were good too. A little variety of everything from comedy to dance to magic. While we were there they had a Mexican Buffet outside with a show and on another night it was Carribean Night. The food for both of those events was great. I have seen some of the other reviews where people complain about the food, but none of our group went hungry. There is always something to choose from. Even the kids were happy, they lived on Tacos, Pizza, burgers and nachos and plenty of desserts. They were good with that. We went into Playa Del Carmen which is a 5 minute, $5.00 taxi ride or about a 10 - 15 minute walk. We found a little taco stand that had the best tacos and margaritas in town. It was so good we went there in December and May and the guy remembered us, of course how could you forget our loud group. We went on an excursion to Coba and swam in a cenote and zip lined in the jungle. That was an experience. If you visit Coba, be sure to hike to the top of the ruin. The view is gorgeous. On another day we visited Maroma Beach which was about 25 minutes from our resort. This is a beautiful beach with a small restaurant - good food and cold beer. We swam there and we went horseback riding. They let us take the horses into the water and swim in the waves. Another day a few of us did the Swim with the Dolphins. What an experience that was. We also visited Xcaret - the eco park. We had fun there too, but a little crowded, that was the only negative to that trip. Lots of people that day. We had lunch at one of the Park's restaurants that overlooked one of the coves. We went snorkeling in the underground river. Everyone liked that. Lots of fish and caves to be seen. The Mayan dinner show is not to be missed. Very entertaining. So much to do and so little time.

My wife and I would like to interject right now; What is all the whining about! If you are lucky enough to be in Mexico, you are lucky enough. No, the resort is not perfect but there are many great things about it too. First, the food is decent, but by the time you add the atmosphere, it makes it even better. Unless you are capable of only eating one thing, there is more than enough variety to pick from. The staff is super, overly accommodating, and extremely hard working. As a guest in their country, paying or not, don't be RUDE! Tipping is also a nice gesture, it is not expected, but is appreciated. The grounds are beautiful, and the ocean is stunning. To all of those crybabies who complain about the sandbags and the lack of beach, how much do you need? Sand is sand, whether there is 20 feet or 50 yards. There is ample room to stretch out and enjoy the sand, water and a cool drink. They are working hard to reclaim the beach. If you need more than that, go to the desert. This may sound a little harsh, but you are on vacation to relax, not nit-pick everything you see. The resort is a fifteen-minute stroll past some beautiful homes I wish I was fortunate enough to own. There is always something fun to do or see in town. Lots of good food, plenty to see and great shopping if you are willing to haggle. All-in-all, our family finds the Allegro a great little resort, moderately priced, beautiful to the eye, and quite comfortable. Don't believe all the negative reviews.

I knew the rooms were small for three people but they are super small. We req'd a rollaway and knew there was no way it would fit. Besides that the musty smell of the room was very strong and it just seemed damp and not cool enough. Third person traveling with us decided she wanted her own room so she was off to the front desk to see about pricing. We also asked her while she was there if she could see about getting us switched. After waiting and waiting my other friend and I went to the front to see what the hold up was. Apparently front desk manager told my third friend that she was not allowed to request a room change. And as for another room for herself they quoted her something very very expensive. So my friend decided to go online to find herself another hotel. My other friend and myself decided to see about a room change. They gave us another key and we went to look at the room. Same problem and friend just sneezed walking into the rooms.

The bathroom in our room the first night smelled quite bad, but we were able to upgrade to an ocean view at a fair price after the first night (and a dose of griping). Otherwise, the room was ok, the maid service proficient, but the air conditioning is simply inadequate to August in Mexico. Not intolerably so, but close. I've seen a lot of complaints in the reviews about the food. This is not del Monicos, but the food is quite good and varied. No complaints at all on that score, and the Italian and Mexian restaurants were especially good. The staff was uniformly very helpful, polite, and engaging, and just nice to be around. If you visit Chichin Itza, strongly recomment you talk with Erika to arrange the tour through Georg (sp). He's an ethnologist in the area whose knowledge and passion for the mayan culture is captivating. There are a lot of deals that can be worked, if you're willing to sit through a 90 minute presentation on timeshares. Be clear -- despite all the talk to the contrary, this is a hard sell exercise and the salesmen are well trained to get you to commit quickly to a financial obligation that probably should be done after extensive thought. Unless you've already decided you want the deal, just say no and keep on saying it. If you decide you like the deal, there will be another day/year. The beach was pretty minimal, so this isn't a beach vacation but an ocean vacation. One gripe is that they only have one kind of beer -- Corona, which is about the worst of Mexico's many fine offerings. A lot of Europeans come to this resort which is great for the variety of interactions, but if you detest smoking as I do, this is a problem. One final word of advice -- this is a cash based economy. Don't expect to get far with your credit cards even for a $300 trip to Xcaret. Fortunately, there is an ATM at a nice mall just 100 yards down the road.

I'm glad we didn't pay much more because it wouldn't have been worth it. Bottom Line: If you can book this resort for a decent price and have low/minimal expectations, you'll be fine. If your paying $175+/night, you should consider other options as there are many. The 3-star rating is appropriate but be careful and don't pay a 4-star price. The Wydham Azteca and the Iberostars are definitely a step above Allegro. This was our fifth trip to Mexico in the last three years. Prior to arriving, we had spent four nights at of our favorite remote outpost in Mexico. In our travels, we have stayed at AIs, local hotels, eaten at very small local restaurants, and eaten food from a variety of street vendors. We have never experienced a bout with Montezuma's revenge. Within 24 hours of our arrival, we were all paid a visit. Our experience was not unique during our stay as many other guests were visited. It's our belief that it came from the water we were served at our first lunch. The resort either does not filter or has issues with their water filtration system. This issue will be difficult for you to avoid as this water is in your pop, ice (and thus frozen drinks), and coffee. We switched to bottled water and limited our in take of resort liquids (except beer and wine). We took our bottled water to meals and made coffee in the room with it. Within a day or two of the switch everyone was fine again. The rooms are adequate, a bit dated, and starting to show signs of age. The air conditioning worked quite well and the ceiling fan ensured air movement. There are eight rooms in each building which gives the resort a nice appearance. Unfortunately, the walls are very thin and sound travels easily (conversations, tv, etc). Luckily we had few neighbors and quiet ones in our building - unfortuantely the same couldn't be said of my crew. Overall, the food is just barely average. The buffet is generally disappointing with a very minimal selection of items. The main 6 meal items (meat, starch/bean, vegetable) are repeated four times on the buffet - one wonders why they couldn't offer a bit more variety rather than having four of the same dish? For dinner, the themed restaurants are slightly better than the buffet and recommended versus the buffet. The themed dinner nights are also a savior from the dreaded buffet. We missed Caribbean night (as we ate in town) and found the food on Mexican night very good (avoid the al pastor station as it was simply terrible - the skirt steak off the grill was quite good a long with numerous side dishes including the salbutes). The grill by the pool for lunch is, again, a much needed rescue from the buffet offering burgers, chicken, fish, vegetables, and pork. Food here is good but did you really come to Mexico and pay $200+/night for hamburgers? The pizzeria is also decent and help to add some variety for lunch or nice late afternoon snack. They do a nice job on maintaing the grounds and the pools are ok. The \"party pool,\" nearest the ocean and bar, is where the normal AI activities take place. A larger quiet pool is directly behind this and offers some peace and serenity and a more appropriate play place for younger children. The outdoor bar area is typically understaffed so expect some lines and wait times for an adult beverage. The plastic bar glasses will also be in short supply on a daily basis so keep tabs on your non-alcholic cup and re-use it.

The bus driver did not give us a voucher when he dropped us off and we had a little trouble getting our room, but after threatening to call Apple vacations and my travel agent they said \"not necessary\". We received no orientation or follow up by any staff. We did not even know we had a mini frig in our room until my son discovered it in a cabinet. This was the first time I have taken my boys abroad and I specifically requested a \"family \" resort for this reason. The nudity on the beach was unexpected to say the least. No where in brochure did it say there was topless sunbathing. If I wanted to see that I would have stayed in Cancun. The brochure also showed beautiful sandy white beaches, not sand bags as far as you can see all up and down the beach. The room was so small. I didn't expect a suite but at least a door on the bathroom so I could change since sharing a room. Only the tiny shower/toilet had a door, there's no way to get dressed in there. My 9 year old did enjoy the kids club pool games and water balloon fights. Patti(kids club staff) did keep both of my boys busy in the pool. The ocean was a beautiful blue if you could just get past the sand bags. The porch light was hanging by a wire and the hammock was broken. I did bring this up, but nothing was done. Food was terrible the first 2 days. Buffet did get better as week went on. Pizzeria by the pool was what the kids liked and the snack bar. Drinks were very weak.

Upon arrival to the hotel at 330 the room wasn't ready - (note: check in is 3 PM). Because I was at noticeably boiling point, they gave us another room so my family didnt' have to wait.. But that was a nightmare in itself because they gave us a microscopic room that stunk and i can't even explain it. Room: Smells, No room for kids to play, old, mattresses are dirty old, and they put a foam cushion to make it more comfortable. Upside, the origami's the cleaning people do to make the rooms more pleasant, the extra towels the organization - is fantastic. they are the friendliest people you will encounter.. at least on the premises. Bathrooms - floors get wet, smells, but its a bathroom. and it has hot water. Premises - spectacular 5 star i give them. Buffet staff - hostess... I personally think its racial my husband thinks its money issue. We tipped her but nothing more than a $1. But I don't think she liked us and two other families we spoke to... if we asked for the air conditioned section she said it wasn't open yet.. (we woudl go eat about 6 PM to avoid over crowding) but if someone walked in a few minutes later with the same request she would sit them in the section we were just told was closed. We complained after 3 incidents and it never happened again.. although neither did her greeting us. She was just plain rude and very obnoxious. Food - eh not too good not too bad... in between. They had very few selections for breakfast and for dinner, for lunch we would eat by the pool area and that was 80% better. The waiters. There are a handful that are great. there are some that can see you dragging the high chairs or need help and won't assist you and then there are others that we look forward to talking to while we are at a meal. disco - Needs more TLC. Good music but you walk in to smelly place. old gringy. No decor nothing that will call your attention. Night shows. 1 to 10 i give 20+ they are awesome. I loved going to the shows. VERY ENTERTAINING. Especially Mexican Heritage night! I was touched. It was a spectacular show! the dancers are talented and are grand! Fun Club. With the exceptions of one or two incidents. (they woudl tell my son and his new found friend that the balls to the iping pong table was not available.. and two minutes later a couple would ask for it and they were given the ball and raquet.. I have to say they really do try to keep everyone entertained. Good looking folks.. the organizer the manager very nice pleasant people. The First Club - The one person who stood oout - I got sick in one of my trips and she really helped us.. Hilda really nice girl.. very friendly - outgoing and did her best to make our stay as comfortable as can be. I heard a rumor that they were going to close the premises for major repairs in the next months or so - i hope so because it would be ashame if because the chain in my opinion is a good chain and well worth the money you spend.

I have two girls (6yrs and 2yrs) my husband and I and we have absolutely no complaints! I know, some of you might think I'm lying but I'm not. I am a true tripadvisor fan and take the website serious when it comes to being objective and like to be honest when I do my reviews. We stayed in building 44, our room was 4402, close to the beach, the pool and towel area. We had two beds in the room, yes it was a bit tight but I expected that when I requested two beds. The room was always clean and it was kept clean all week thanks to the wonderful maintenance staff. I had a different towel animal each day and found the room spotless everyday-trust me, with my two girls the room was never fun to clean. The mini fridge was stocked as needed. The hammock is a nice touch to the room when you want to lay on it and just nap- did it twice. The beds are firm and have a mattress pad for all the complainers who want something softer. We all slept like babies and never woke up with any back problems. I never had a noise issue, my girls were a bit loud at night before going to bed but I never heard my neighbors, if they heard me, they never complained. The resort is spotless. I have never seen so many people dedicate the time to picking up leaves, yeah leaves! There is always someone cleaning the pool daily, washing the sand off the path, cutting the grass, sprinklers keep all the property nice and green, the place gets touch ups everywhere you see. It's not that big but I would not consider it small, it has 58 buildings, each building has two floors. There is something for everyone to eat at all times. I don't like the people that complain about the food or the closing of the buffet. I think there is always something for everyone and if they close the buffet it\u2019s because they have to prepare for dinner and dress the place up but they always open the another area for food. You can never go hungry in this place or thirsty! They have a daily grill lunch with your American goodies if you miss home (burgers and hotdogs) steaks, chicken, and ribs too. The dinners change daily and have a variety for everyone not get bored of the same thing. All the staff is wonderful, attentive, and very hard working! The beach is small. It was really hit bad last year with the hurricane. I need to be clear on this issue- all of PDC was affected by this hurricane. Therefore, all the resorts on the PDC strip have the same problem of erosion. They pump sand into the beach and block the current with large sand bags. So it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a 5 star hotel or a 2 star hotel, the beach is the same for all. You can\u2019t mess with Mother Nature and expect to reclaim it in a year. It took Cancun almost 4 years to recover and some resorts simply did not reopen. So please understand that Allegro Playa del Carmen is doing its best for the guests to enjoy the beach. Having said all that- there are plenty of beach chairs and canopies for shade but if you want to reserve some seats before breakfast, it doesn\u2019t hurt. I never had any problems getting four chairs. The pool area is always a favorite for me and my girls. They have two pools. One is more active than the other-only because they use it for fitness exercises so it can be a bit loud but nothing you need to worry. The other pool is more family style for kids to lay and jump in. please do not think you can not relax, yes you can. Drinks are great-try mojitos, caipirina, miami vice, strawberry dackaries, and don\u2019t forget the coronas. The location of Allegro is perfect! It is the third resort on the strip, $5USD to 5th Avenue (shopping area) or a 20-25 minute walk. The walk is pleasant and not dangerous. After two or three times of walking to 5th avenue you enjoy it so just take the cab on the way back if you are too tiered to walk or too tipsy to make it back. The Ferry to Cozumel is right on 5th avenue and its $24 round trip for all those who are wondering. The ferry is top of the line, take the yellow ferry, they have a live band. For those of you who have never been on a ferry, you might get sea sick. I recommend this resort for couples and families. It\u2019s not a place for singles to party like spring breakers. The food is good, service is fantastic, location is perfect, and the place is clean. It\u2019s up to each individual to make the best or the worst of a vacation.

Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst hotel I've ever stayed at, but it's not even close to the best either. My partner and I have travelled to Mexico several times this past year. She has TAN which is like a time share but you don't get to pick your hotel, just the location and a certain amount of weeks and then they tell you where you'll stay. We figured we'd use one of the weeks that she had and get away since the room was already paid for- we just had to pay for food and flight. We were told that this was a 30+ hotel and no kids. Wrong. Not like we don't like kids but when you don't expect them to be there it was a little bit of a surprise. Anyway, we were there I guess on a \"Promotion\" Basiclly that means they try to sell you into thier Occidental First Club, which is a vacation club. Mercedes (our rep) was... animated. If you have to sit through the presentation just be patient. This hotel is not a good representation for what they're trying to sell you. The other reviews are pretty spot on. The walls are really thin so if you have noisy neighbors it's a drag. There are good points to buying into the club if you travel often though. The friends stay for FREE was huge for me, just couldn't afford it. Anyway, because they wanted us to buy in we got a little bit of an upgraded room. It was OK that's it. They did have a mattress pad on the bed which was so helpful since the beds are usually rock hard in Mexico. So expect a hard bed. Food was ok, and so was the staff.

The lighting fixture were covered in what appeared to be calf skin, and they were wet, sticky, and smelly. The bathroom was filthy, and looked like a child did the construction work. Dont let your clothes in the bathroom they will get soaked because the shower has a small piece of glass that covered maybe 1/3 of the shower. We were what they refer to as \"First Club\" or VIP, and were given even the wrong TYPE of room. We were given an economy/standard room instead of our VIP suite (with a bar, kitchenette, larger TV, etc.). After we complained that evening about the room to get it switched, they couldn't move us until the morning. First thing in the morning we switched rooms, and were still given a Standard room, but atleast the A/C worked and it was habitable. The bed was still hard as a rock, but it was like that in all of the rooms.. The room was open to the outside at the ceiling and there were geckos in bugs in all of the rooms. Shorltly after we switched rooms, our passports were stolen out of our room. It was reported to the staff who simply said \"no, that doesn't happen\" They told us NOT to report them stolen at the police station, and gave us a run around for almost 2 days as what we should do. Finally I called the US consular in play del carmen, and she straightened everything out for us. The pools close at 8pm which i thought was strange, and there were barely any activities to do after that. On a Good Note the entertainment was awesome! The food was ok, but made me sick for 3 days while I was there. No, I didn't drink the water. Some of the employees at the front check in were helpful, and maybe one of the First Club employees. The other first club employees were useless at solving any minor problems. They tried to double charge for spa services and took almost 45 minutes to remove ONE massage from the bill. The setting was nice, but some of the quality of craftsmanship was very poor. Railings were hanging off of the stairs, some stair tread were loose and rotting, and the doors had about a 1/2\" gap the whole way around them. The rooms were barely soundproof and you could hear the people in surrounding rooms even when they were just walking around. Oh and we had to have our safe unlocked two times by security because it kept freezing up.. \"Satellite TV\" that they claim to have consisted of 24 channels that were so fuzzy i might as well had an antenna, and there was exposed wiring in our room. So basically -Customer Service was ok for most people -VIP customer service was horrible (odd right?) -Food was ok -Rooms were disgusting and cheaply built -Entertainment was AWESOME -Evening activities did not exist -Security is poor and were not willing to help when our passports were stolen -Amenities misrepresented", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "County Durham", "Title": "\u201cSuch a pity\u201d", "Author": "Disappointed23", "ReviewID": "UR17310669", "Content": "Let me tell you the plus side. The hotel is set in beautifully kept, well manicured grounds, which are home to a variety of harmless wildlife, including iguanas, lizards, birds and some little creatures whose name escapes my memory, but I believe are a cross between a hare and a squirrel. The hotel atmosphere is pleasant, the staff (without exception) are first class, the waiters are especially happy, efficient, eager to help, nothing is a trouble to them. Can't fault the food, either, there was something for everyone's taste and I am not a person who is easily pleased as far as food is concerned. Here is another bonus point, the cutlery and crockery were beautifully clean, which is something of a rarity, even in some of the higher rated hotels. The entertainment is first class, didn't do much during the day, but there was always something for those who wanted to. The evening entertainment was professional and polished, very talented dancers and superb costumes. The pool area could benefit from a bit of TLC. A nightly hose of the loungers and tables would help to spruce up their jaded appearance. Now to the downside, which I consider to be a major problem. Having read lots of reviews of this hotel, I feel that I must have stayed somewhere completely different. The 4* bedroom was definitely no better than a 2*, but in fairness the bed was kept spotlessly clean and I did get used to it. BUT, the bathroom was the worst I have ever had the misfortune to use. The decor was dowdy, patched up plastered walls, scruffy, marked. The bath was absolutely disgusting, it was possibly spray painted, old, tatty horrible. It was an insult to the standards of decent people. I honestly did not hear a favourable comment from one other person. Good news however. I understand from a reliable source that the rooms are to be refurbished. So fine for future guests, but that is no advantage to me. I would possibly return to this hotel though only if the bedrooms, but especially the bathrooms were brought up to date and would merit its 4* rating.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRum Punch & The Dog Cat Gang\u201d", "Author": "PJdogcat", "ReviewID": "UR17297086", "Content": "Just returned from 7 days at the Allegro playacar ' paradise ' !

However, it really was a great place to stay for honeymooners, families, or just with friends. We had notified the resort that we were going to be honeymooner's at the time of booking and the resort upgraded our room (closer to the beach!), gave us vouchers for free 10 minute massages at their spa, a breakfast meal brought to us one morning, and a fruit basket in the room at no additional cost! The resort was kept very clean. The grounds were beatiful! Our room was upstairs and for the most part was a great room. The A/C worked great. The maid service did an excellent job of keeping the rooms clean. The safe worked fine. The only small complaint is that the matress was a little harder than I'm used to. The buffet was average quality. It was not great but by no means was it horrible. On the Monday night that we were there they had a Mexican party and the food was really good. The snack bar down by the pool was good. The two reasturants, The Italian and The Mexican were excellent! You have to make reservations for those two but it is worth it. The hotel always had something to do if you wanted or you could just relax by the pool or beach! The entertainment at night is fun. The resort is close to 5th Avenue and the ferry to Cozumel. There are large sandbags on the resort's beach, but on the bright side it created a pool that people and children could play in without the crashing of waves.

It was our two year anniversary since we first met across the waters at Allegro Cozumel and we really wanted to go back there. However, the hotel was closed for renovations so Allegro Playacar was the next best thing. We arrived late on a Wednesday, enjoyed the buffet dining, got drunk and then went to sleep. We were awakened approximately 5:30 by the birds, as our room was on the top floor and must have been the home for a flock of black birds. My boyfriend was up and ready to go by 6, but me being lazy and on vacation opted to get a few more ZZZs. If you are used to running onto the beach from the shore, don't go to Playa! Poor Playa, all the beaches are inhibited by GEOTUBES to stop beach erosion. They are as large as school buses filled with sand, placed on the beach, right where the tide comes in. It has taken the beauty away from the beach. Well, my boyfriend ventured out to view the beautiful ocean on a geotube and, not knowing the danger involved in the geotubes, attempted to walk across one, ultimately landing on his shoulder and fracturing it! Ladies, if you know how men complain when they are hurt, you definitely have pity for the rest of my vacation. We were not able to kayak, wind sail, SWIM or do anything physical because he was obvsiously in such pain. At any rate, the food was great, especially Friday night's outdoor buffet. The drinks were great and the people were quite friendly. The room was freezing cold and clean, but noisy with birdies early in the morning. I slept better after I got used to the noises. The hammock on the porch was awesome and the anniversary was memorable! Shower water was hot if you hit it before 10 AM, but don't expect a hot, full pressured shower after 5 PM. There were plenty of beach and pool chairs to lay in. There were plenty of activities if that's your thing. We never left the resort, but it did appear there were excursions galore. Make sure you confirm your ride to the airport. We were never told of the time our transfer was going to pick us up so we came down to the lobby about three hours early to find they had just left the hotel without us.

The service is excellent. As always when you book a seaview cabin, they don\u00b4t have it on arrival. But in 2 days we could move into a seaview cabin. And that was really the best place to reside in this resort. The beach at date (april 2008) is still short. There were still sand bags looking like \"whales\" in the water. But it was not bothering. They are actually winning sand back at the moment so that is a good thing. There are plenty of activities to do, as well in the 2nd swimming pool as outside. There are for example shows in the night, but also the possibility to do some kayak or catamaran sailing. one hour free. Also other watersports can be done, but they cost money. In general you can say that tours that the hotel offers are some 20 USD more expensive than the tours you book in the centre of Playa del Carmen. Have to say that a taxi ride costs 50 pesos (or 5 USD one way). Walking is a possibility, but only when the sun is down (because of the heat and humidity). It\u00b4s a 15 minutes walk. What is so nice about the hotel is that it is not a typical hotel concrete block of a building. It\u00b4s like a tiny village with 8 rooms in every cabin (4 downstairs, 4 upstairs). The problem is that with one of the other rooms you compare an in between door (in case you book 2 rooms for one family) and because this is not wall, the noise comes through this door. But we had that problem only one night out of 7. Not all the rooms have this in between door. The hotel is all inclusive, and that includes all alcoholic beverages. After check out they do not cut your bracelet, so if your transfer back is later than 12.00 you are not obliged to pay for drinks or food.

It was a first trip to the Caribbean for both of us. We are both in our 40's. We couldn't get a flight out of Ottawa on the date we needed so we drove to Montreal and flew from there. It seemed we were the only English people on the plane. Our trip was with Nolitours and we flew on Air Transat. The flight was good except that the form we had to fill out for Mexican customs was in French and Spanish. A flight attendant helped fill it out but it was irritating not to have one in English. When we arrived in Cancun, we got to the bus and a person from Nolitours got on and gave a five minute speel in French. We thought that she would give it in English next but she jumped off the bus and disappeared before we could say anything. Surprisingly all the people on the bus only spoke French - not a bilingual person among the crowd, so we still don't know what she said. The people trying to get you to go for their timeshare sales pitch at the resort got to be a bit hard to take after a time. We would kid around with them and put them off nicely. They are stationed right next to the entrance to the buffet and lobby so it is hard to avoid them. It got to be a bit much when they would intercept you on the street in front of the resort and try to badger you into giving them \"90 minutes\" of your time. We spoke to people who did agree to it and 90 minutes became three hours. They would give you a t-shirt or discount coupons on tours or rental cars, but three hours is a lot of vacation to give up to listen to a high pressure sales speel. The resort is very nice. The buildings are open and airy with thatched roofs. We even saw some Iguanas on the grounds. There were some animals that I've never even heard of before - about the size of a cat but sort of looked like a cross between a pig, rat, and squirrel. Someone told me what they were called but I can't remember. There was even the odd gheko in the thatched roof in our room. They make a nice chirping sound at night. The landscaping at the resort was very nice. The beach is a little lacking from the hurricane damage but they are constantly working to restore it and made a lot of progress enlarging it while we were there. There was plenty of room for everyone and we even managed to find loungers on the few occasions when we forgot to reserve them early. I liked the sound of the birds in the morning - It was the first time I heard that particular birdsong. I still don't know what they are called but they look like a common grackle with a really long tail. There was a pair of doves nesting under the eve of the roof just outside our room and they were very entertaining to watch from the hammock. The waiters and bartenders were very friendly and efficient. During busier times at the buffet it was sometimes hard to get a drink or second drink but it was just because it was so busy. We really loved the staff - everyone was very friendly and always upbeat and very helpful. I literally fell in love with Pilar, the hostess at the Buffet. (Being the shy type I just admired her from afar though.) We had a room on the second floor with two double beds. The room was kept very clean except for the floor which always looked dirty. The room initially had a musty-mildew odour but it seemed to go away after the first day. There wasn't much of a shower curtain on the shower stall and it was hard to keep the water from spraying all over the place. There was always plenty of hot water and the pressure was good as well. The AC worked well too. There was a thatched roof on our room and it was nice except that it didn't do much to block noise from outside on the few occasions there was some. If I could make a suggestion to the resort it would be to put rubber wheels on the carts that the staff use early in the morning - people are on vacation and the noise from those plastic wheels going over the rough walkway at seven or eight in the morning isn't conducive to a nice sleep in. It sounds like a freight train going by. Some hydraulic door closers would go a long way to reducing the noise level as well - lots of slamming doors all the time. I don't know if people are just inconsiderate or if the wind would get behind the doors but it seemed there was a lot of slamming going on sometimes. The food was good with a lot of variety at the buffet, although it seemed to get a little repetitive toward the end. We really enjoyed the omelette bar at breakfast. We ate at \"the Mexican\" A-La-Carte one night and really enjoyed it. We never tried the Italian one as it seemed we could never remember to make a reservation during the hours when you could. The beer was very weak - I'm not much of a drinker but I drank at least 20 glasses on the first day and didn't even get a buzz. The mixed drinks weren't the best either - you could sometimes get bacardi and coke but more often they would pore a cheaper rum. If you like rye, forget it, there isn't any. The glasses didn't always seem to be the cleanest either and there were times when they would run out. Someone would make the rounds and gather them up and they seemed to wash them in a big hurry as a result. We went to Xel-Ha for a day and the beer and liqour were much better there - you could actually get a buzz from the beer and the mixed drinks were noticably better tasting. We met some very nice people during our stay but found there was a lot of younger people there especially during the first week. As always there were also a few noisy, rude people. We were awakened by screaming drunk teenagers on two nights but the noise didn't last long and I had no problem getting back to sleep. I am an early riser and I managed to get some really nice pictures of the sunrise from the beach. There was some coffee pots between the two pools and usually some fresh coffee after six o'clock. The coffee wasn't the best but was usually drinkable. Overall, it was a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation at the Allegro Playacar. I'm not sure that I would go back, not because of anything specific at the resort but because I plan on seeing other places.

I really enjoyed the beautiful, tropical grounds of the hotel! The website doesn't capture the beauty of the place. I especially liked that it was not a high rise hotel where you always wait for an elevator to get to your room. Our rooms were very accessible to the beach and pool area. Enjoyed the hammock on our balcony alot-- a nice touch. I had read reviews of how hard the beds were, but was very glad to find nice foam pads added to the beds. I slept great on them except for the fact that the rooms are not very sound proof at all. Our 1st night there we woke up at 3:30am to the people below us coming in from partying all night and they were rediculously loud! The rooms are not really very big but it was fine for us. Liked the thatch roof in the room! We didn't use our air conditioning much at all, but the few times we did, it did leak water out of the ceiling in the bath area. Absolutely loved the sound of all the tropical birds on the grounds that would be my alarm clock every morning. What a great way to wake up! Because I wasn't traveling with my husband we were not approached for time share once,YEA! I did miss that there was no fitness center and wished they offered more yoga or pilates classes earlier than 10 or 11am. I didn't think the entertainment was all that great most nights compared to some other all inclusives we've been to. The food was good. We ate 2 nights at the Italian restaurant- very good and nice to be served a sit down meal a few times. I highly recommend planning your own excursions- the hotel does charge way too much. Go into Playa del carmen and use the \"Servicio\" vans. They go up and down the hi-way and you can go anywhere you want on your own. very easy! and cheap! Also the \"Playa Express\" takes you to Cancun for cheap. Don't pay taxi's to go most places. We would stay at the Allegro again,liked the location to town also. If you have young kids take note there is some women topless sunbathing and the activities guys really like to make the girls \"pole dance\" by the pool and even at the show some nights. We got tired of that and they embarassed alot of girls and some women that were good sports to go along with it but not wanting to do it . That was the activities guys favorite saying \"DO IT! DO IT!\" Whatever! We found a great lagoon in Akumal called \"YAL-KU\" for a day of snorkeling. It was $7.50 to get in,$10.00 to rent equipment, beautiful and great fish to see! We took the vans down to Akumal, walked into the plaza area and payed a taxi $7.00 to take us to the lagoon. You could walk about 30-45min to get there too. A really cool looking restaurant along the way on the ocean but didn't have time to go there.

This is truly a 3 maybe 3 1/2 star resort and that is it, not a 4 or 5 star!! I'm really glad we stayed here as we had a wonderful time! We simply said no to the timeshare people who offered you free gifts. Never had any problems with them after that. Our biggest problem was calling home, our calling card we bought in US would'nt work. One of the timeshare sharks working there told us to walk 3 minutes down the street and use the internet cafe phone and had no problems after that. So all he asked when we got back was to go listen to the timeshare deal so we did. It took 1 1/2 hours then we said thats all the longer we would spend and we were off to the beach by 9 am! Other than that, the food at the resort was very good, little repetitive by the end of our stay but thats anywhere after 7 days! The buffet area was totally redone in 2006 and was very nice. The theature where they put on nightly shows is new as well and the shows were very good also! The grounds were emaculant and very well taken care of every day. At night it was lit up and looked very nice as well. The rooms were out of date and small but were clean and showers were always warm with great pressure. My biggest complaint would have to be the noise flowed right through the walls exterior as well as interior! We could here our neighbors conversation with out even trying, and the birds were crazy in the mornings, but that could happen other places as well! The pools were nice and the drinks were good so if you cant sleep you just need to drink more!! All in all we had a great time, the location is great as it took us only 15 mn. to walk into town and there is lots to see and do. My advise to you would be do not book day trips through the resort as you will get trapped into the time share, however if your looking for cheaper entrys, spending an hour and a half may be worth it.

The rooms are very dirty, and I am used to Mexican hotels and culture. They stated no spring breakers allowed, however it was nothing short of a huge party. My fourteen year old son was asked if he knew where to get some morphine, while I was standing next to him! The rooms are extremely loud. The worst though was when I bite into a meatball to find a metal knot, the kind used on the end of sausage casings. That was my last straw, and I immediately insisted management move us to another hotel or I would consider a suit. Management moved us to their sister property the Occidental Grand Flamenco Xcaret only after I signed all my rights to liability away. I was going to go next door to Royal Playacar, or another hotel and pay the extra cash, however everyone was full. I took the offer, and was overall satisfied there. The problem again at that hotel was that our rooms were right next to the theatre which was so loud we couldn't hear a T.V. until 11:00 p.m. each night, so once again I had to switch to another room. The other room was much better, but we could hear an endless stream of people walking over our heads each night. I'm not one to complain, but at neither hotel did we sleep. The Riviera Maya is my favorite destination, and we have traveled extensively and lived in Europe. We had a wonderful trip, however next time we will stay in no less than six stars.

Everything is taken care of, the food is great (if you only have to eat it a few days) and the entertainment is fun for a few days as well. The hammock on each patio is great for taking afternoon naps and both pools are well maintained.

I'll start with the negatives, because these are the reasons we would not stay at the Allegro again. The Hard Sell: Every single item or activity purchased at this hotel was far overpriced. DO NOT BUY any activities or tours from this hotel...you are better off shopping around Playa del Carmen for reasonable prices for tours to Tulum, Chichen Itza, Xelha, fishing, etc. Alex, the head hospitality guy whose job it was to ensure we had fun, seemed to be the biggest scammer, and indeed charged us $184 US for one day at Chichen Itza ($72 per person) while tour guides in town only charged $40. We already had purchased two free tours to any place we wanted with a competitor hotel for $40 and a \"presentation\" but Alex confiscated our receipt without permission, telling us it was a scam and that he would give us the best deals in town. When we complained about some of this employee's unsavoury practices (overcharging, not issuing receipts, confiscating receipts purchased from other businesses, etc.) the Front Desk manager assured us that this was an isolated incident from a rogue employee acting on his own. To compensate, the Manager agreed to return our $184 in cash, provided we sat through a 90 minute presentation on vacation packages, the next day. He also promised that the employee would be layed off for a week as punishment. The next day and for the rest of the week, we noticed that the employee was still there (hence he was doing his job exactly as instructed and condoned by management) and we had to undergo 2.5 hours of excruciatingly distasteful hard sells that, to get your money's worth, you would have to live 150 years, travel once a year for 100 years, and take 5 other people with you. We basically had to fight to get out of this nightmare, which used all the classic brainwashing techniques, that, quite frankly, insulted my intelligence. To add insult to injury, they then refunded my money in \"Allegro dollars\" meaning it was like Monopoly money that could only be spent at the hotel. After another 30 minutes of some choice words with management, I finally received my refund in US dollars. Buying a car is even less painful the this vacation package hard sell experience. The room: We had arranged for a non-smoking room but were given a smoking room. We were then forced to move our own luggage to a new non-smoking room that had a musty smell and two separate beds instead of one king size bed. We were promised that we would get the room we reserved properly by the next day, but that never happened. In addition, if you have noisy neighoburs, forget sleeping as the light and the noise carries over the ceiling. No prob if your neighbours are quiet though. The food: The a la carte Italian and Mexican were top notch. 2 thumbs up. The buffet was ok, if you just like luke warm food. However, you could get hot food if you waited for an omelet fresh from the grill. The outdoor restaurants by the pool were also impressive with good selection. The cleaning and cooking staff: Top notch and very friendly. The activities: Lots to do, but I suggest the Allegro start using proper hygiene when teaching scuba lessons. They DO NOT sterilize the mouthpiece in between users. Fortunately I only caught a bad cold as a result, instead of Hep A. We also went to Chichen Itza, Tulum and Xelha, and I recommend all three as a must! If you can do Xcaret, do so as well...we ran out of time, alas. The beach: Unimpressive and small, with large sandbags due to hurricane damage, but we walked a few kms down into the jungle and found some great swimming places. Two armed guards approached us one day and suggested this may be unwise, assuming we did not want to get robbed and murdered, so we vamoosed back to civilization after 3 hours of great swimming. The Allegro has a nice pool, but who the heck wants to fly for thousands of kms to swim in a pool that you can do at home? The warm ocean is a prime reason for coming here in the first place! Nightly entertainment was good. This type of hotel and location should only be visited by people who do not have difficulty saying no or ignoring annoying solicitors. In Canada, we keep these types away from the hotel grounds, but in the Mayan Riviera, it appears the hotels and particularly the Allegro, invite them in and employ them. A vacation, in my mind, should be to get away from this nonsense, not to see more. Except for the neighbours having unusually noisy sex every night, the grounds were quiet enough, with most of the drunks sticking to Cancun....this was also one of the reasons we picked Mayan Riviera, as Cancun seemed to be for drunks while Puerto Vallarta has cold ocean water. At least I think we picked the best of the three choices.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cIt was okay\u201d", "Author": "islandgirldreaming", "ReviewID": "UR14475833", "Content": "My husband and I recently spend a week at the Allegro Playacar.

We walked into Playa del Carmen a couple times, and it's only a five dollar cab ride if you're tired or wearing heels ;0). We caught public transit (the collectivo) to Tulum and totally recommend it. It only costs $3 one way and it's not much slower than a car ride. Don't let any try to convince you that you should take a tour with their cousin or whomever. You'll have more fun on your own, you can set your own schedule and save $$. The food was okay. The buffet was understaffed, so it was difficult to get more than one drink with your meal. The variety of the food didn't change much from night to night, but what they had was good enough. Sure, it wasn't piping hot, but it's a BUFFET. I didn't get sick, and it was pretty tastey. The snack bar by the pool was awesome. I ate sooo much guacamole. It was nice to just wander up from the beach, get a bite to eat, then hop back in the ocean without putting on pesky clothes. I really enjoyed the Italian restaurant, but I wasn't as taken by my meal at the Mexican restaurant. The entertainment was... entertaining, but for the wrong reasons. I found myself cringing in embarassment for the staff on more than one occassion. It was amatuer to say the least. They had special entertainers in one night, who totally blew the usual entertainment away. Our room was nice enough; it was clean and in good repair. We woke up to the birds everymorning at 6 a.m., but I can think of worse ways to be woken up. It was better than the sounds we got to hear from the couple next door at night (don't come here for a romantic getaway!) The grounds are beautiful, and the beach is...well, being reclaimed, but it serves it purpose. The daily activities were humourous. We took a dancing lesson and I've gotten better moves out of step class at my gym. As for the toilet paper thing, that is standard through out Mexico because the whole country has been plumbed with 3\" pipes and not the 4\" we have in N. America.

Compare it to a cruise, well \"no\" in areas of food and entertainment. However, unlike a cruise we were able to get a chair by the beach or by either pool each and every day - (before 7 A.M. which seems to be the norm on a cruise). We also did not get the \"bar bill\" at the end. Also we enjoyed the freedom of moving around easily and being able to visit Playa Del Carmen, Cancun and Cozumel very easily and safely. The area is nothing like Jamaica which can be scary... The breakfast was more that anyone would need - what do you normally eat everyday anyway??? Lunch fine. Dinner at the restaurants (at no additional charge) was very good. OK - buffet dinner was not that great, but not that bad. We only ate there twice in 6 days - we were busy moving around all the area has to offer. Anyway, we are not used to the best of the best...

My group became close with the activities staff and met a lot of other people there. After staying at large resorts I strongly prefer the closeness of the small resort.

They didn't try to take our money as someone before said, they actually got us better deals. We went to Cancun for 2 nights and spent less for the ride there and for open bar than the normal price just to enter. I highly recommend taking a trip with the activities staff to the club coco bongo, it was an awesome time. The staff are also great entertainers during the day, never a dull moment from kayak races to beer drinking contests to tequilla shots from losing at darts. The highlight was the water balloon fights where everyone around the pool got really into it, really a fun experience. The rooms were small but comfortable. Not many channels but enough to watch while getting ready for the night.

I knew what we were getting into and I know you get what you pay for, but this resort is not worth spending your money on. We had three rooms, and as requested, we all got lower floor rooms near each other. Out of the three rooms, only one room was in working order.

Felt very safe. Security was always around:-) Pool chairs.... I reserved ours each morning, but wasn't really necessary. Between the two pools & beach there seemed to be ample for everyone. Loved the \"friendliness\" of staff & most visitors:-) There were some that should have stayed at home as I don't think you could please them anywhere.

We arrived late afternoon and were one of two families to check in - very smooth. I happened to ask if they were busy and was told that they were actually overbooked for the coming days so I asked what they do about it and was told they move people to their sister hotel, the Xcaret. We were going there anyhow the next week and it was a 5* as opposed to 4* at Allegro so we volunteered to be \"upgraded\" to the Xcaret if they allowed us to spend a couple of days at the Allegro so we could do Playa Del Carmen and Cozumel before moving. They did allow us this plus gave us one extra day at Xcaret so we wouldn't have to move back to Allegro for just one day and then get back to Xcaret for our 2nd week. They also shuttled us there (we were going to have to pay for this on our own in the original plan) - this upgrade went very smoothly. They have large \"cabanas\" with 8 rooms each - 4 up and 4 down, each with a hammock on the deck. We had a morning dove who perched outside the door and were awakened each morning by the beautiful cooing. We saw a gecko in the room high in the ceiling (we were on the top floor) once, but never down in the actual room area. I think it quite normal to find geckos in your hotel room in Mexico - no matter the standard (we had a regular one in the 5* Xcaret as well). I thought the place was quite nice. If you have noisy neighbours though and are on the top floor I suspect that could be annoying, however in 3 nights we only heard our neighbours once. Beach as previously stated is being reclaimed but every hotel along the beach stretch is the same. Pool was nice and there was always lots of action in the water with parasailers, water scooters, boats and ships to watch. If you prefer a quiet beach - you might find it kind of \"busy\" Food seemed fine for the few days we were there, service seemed great. The one down side for us was the time share set up. And like others have said each hotel tries to get you on this. We were aware of this ahead of time and tried to avoid it (watch for them at the airport as well as in Playa Del Carmen on the strip - they may be a snorkel tour guide but he's probably also selling time shares at the same time!!). At the hotel they are also sneaky! It turned out a \"concierge\" was our first contact and he helped us find our room. I figured a concierge would not be someone selling time shares so after trying to dodge the people we thought were obviously sales people, we figured the concierge would be safe....wrong! He was the one who was first in the line of \"sales\" people. We made the mistake of going back down after settling in the room and he made mention of our \"welcome gift\" and that was the beginning! Next thing you know we had signed up for something the next morning (which then caused us to miss our orientation meeting for our tour group). No mention of time shares or the like was really ever mentioned so we really weren't sure what was going on until we saw something about taking up 90 mins. of our time, then we started to get suspicious. We should have walked away at that time, but we had been told they would show us some information on the Xcaret hotel where we were moving and that's what we were interested in so we continued on. We were to be taken for breakfast with another friendly \"sales\" guy (the breakfast was nothing special and in fact was just at the regular buffet). He takes you on a tour of the complex and then he passes you to the hard nosed sales guy who is the annoyingly cliched sales man! This totally turned us off! Once we transferred to Xcaret we were a little more aware of what to look for (at Xcaret the maids put an \"invitation\" and mention of free gift in your door to snag you in!). Note; the fellow in Allegro told us by Mexican law they can't bother you a second time. We finally told the guys in Xcaret we'd done the spiel in Allegro and they never asked us again so this must be true). Generally we enjoyed our short time there but can't really judge it too seriously as we only had 2 full days and nights at this hotel.

We arrived late wednesday evening, with no problems checking in, very speedy, and very friendly. The resort it self is very nice, well kept, and reletively clean. They have neat little villas you stay in, about 4 rooms to a villa, depending on if there is a suite above you or not. They are very small, and everything you can expect from a mexican 2-3 star hotel. Nothing special, with rock hard beds, and semi clean bathrooms. We didn't have any problems with our room, our party consisted of 12 people, and some of us had problems with air conditioning and what not, but were taken care of very quickly. They have one main buffet in the main building, with very repetive food selection, it was decent, but same thing every night. Another buffet was located at the pools, and open for lunch accompinied by a BBQ, with burgers and fries, which were decent. Two Al a carte restaurants, one italian, one mexican... They were also decent. The two pools were very nice, and clean, with plenty of room to accomodate everyone. Entertainers are friendly and always looking to have a good time. However, this is where I rate the hotel poorly... Trust only the entertainers to on site activities, when it comes to off site activities such as pub crawls, or nights out on the town, they CANNOT be trusted. All 5 of the entertainers took our group of 12 people out on our last night to a club. It was the worst experience I have ever had in Mexico. They took 20 dollars from each on of us (Group of 12 people) to get a ride to the club and back, entry cover, and one drink. The night consisted of almost getting in a fight with unionized cab drivers, almost getting run off the road by the same cab drivers, getting rejected from a local club, they managed to have us pay for ALL of their drinks, they made us tip more on a bill, that they clearly took for them selves, and to top it all off, they asked for more money from each on of us, to get back to our hotel at the end of the night... that was 10 dollars from each on of us, for a 5 dollar cab ride home. By this time all 12 of us had enough of it, and walked away from these scam artists, who were suppose to be our hotel entertainers, and dropped them for the rest of the night. Other than the horrible entertainment staff, the hotel was great, great service, friendly bartenders, restaurant staff, and great house keeping. If you are traveling to Playa Del Carmen for the beaches, do not waste your money. As mentioned in previous reviews and according to the pictures, the locals are trying to reclaim the beaches. Huge whale size sandbags are placed along the beach and about 15 from shore to break the waves before they reach the shore... They then pump sand section by section back on to the shore from the ocean floor trying to build up the beaches to what they once were. We made the best of it however by climbing on these sandbags, and jumping into the water, and making games out of it.", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cA delightful experience\u201d", "Author": "ConnecticutRoberto", "ReviewID": "UR13761109", "Content": "This is a copy of an e-mail that I sent to the manager of the Allegro/Playacar after returning from a 2 week stay there. =================================== My wife and I have recently returned home after a delightful two weeks stay at your Occidental Allegro resort in Playa del Carman. We arrived on February 6th and we departed on February 19th. The purpose of this letter is to thank you for the wonderful time that we enjoyed at the Allegro. My wife and I have had the good fortune of traveling all over the world, including Europe, China, Japan, and India. I am delighted to tell you that your Allegro was a most delightful experience. The setting, the facility, the accommodations and the food were outstanding. However our greatest delight was in your staff. The loving hospitality that they displayed was the high-light of our stay. Their care and affection toward us went far beyond what ever training they may have received. It may simply be a part of the Mexican and Mayan cultures. Whatever the source, they made us feel like family. Unfortunately I don't have the names of all the people who were so kind to us but here are three who were outstanding. Pilar, the hostess at the breakfast buffet Victor, a waiter at the breakfast buffet Dominique, at the Guest Services desk in the lobby Alberto, a photographer These people are a credit to your resort and to the full experience of restful peace and welcoming hospitality.

They served Corona as the domestic beer and they even had lots of limes. We had a ground floor room which was nice. The base of the bed is concrete but there is a thick mattress and a memory foam also on top and lots of pillows. It was very comfortable. We saw a fly once other then that no bugs. We did see an Iguana on the property an some baby gekos. The pools were excellent and there were always loungers. The beach was fine if you walked down the beach a little bit you could get into the ocean and swim out with no sandbags in your way. I would also like to say in some reviews they make it look like this is the only resort affected ,well it is not as it is like that all the way down the beaches in Playacar even the 5 star hotels have sandbags on the beach!!! There is plenty of sand and loungers. They are out there everyday working on the beach it is actually quite interesting on how they do it. You are 20 mins away from Playa del Carmen(walking) and it is a great shopping area. You can walk ( 20 mins,it is very safe there) or take a Taxi (5 mins) for $5. There is also a small strip mall you can walk to 5 mins away. A must day trip is to Coba it is well worth the money and has the only Ruin you can still climb, you visit a Mayan family and swim in a senosa.

When we got there we were immediately pounced upon by the resorts representatives trying to sell us holiday or timeshare; this we did not take kindly to as we had been travelling for 22 hrs. We agreed to see them the following morning just to get them off our backs! When the morning arrived and we had our breakfast we were told that we should attend the meeting as we were on their schedule, we walked passed and went on our way, much to their annoyance. We went down to the beach and found to our horror that there was no beach. The beach was blown away 2 years ago or so when a hurricane hit the area. They are currently trying to rebuild the beach by using 5-6 ton sand bags!. They are sucking sand from off shore into these bags on the beach and trying to build up squares so that the sand can rest inside the squares.Consequently on the beach there are huge hoses and petrol/electric driven engines sucking the sand from offshore. This is making just offshore very deep and forcing rip currents to speed up and down the whole beach area, as far as the eye can see in either direction, making it dangerous to swim in most conditions. There are even signs on the beach advising to watch out for underwater obstructions as these are dangerous. All the hotels as far as the eye can see on that piece of coast have this problem. We spent the whole holiday beside the pools that they have on site. If this was the type of holiday that we had wanted then we could have gone to anywhere in the Mediterranean and spent a whole lot less! We wanted a beach and warm sea for swimming and snorkelling and this resort seemed to offer the deal, but there was no lush green vegetation surrounding the site, no beach, and just other resorts hard up to the wire fence surrounding this site. If you view the Occidental Allegro Playacar website it shows nothing of this problem it just shows a beautiful beach, and the site surrounded by lush green vegetation. The beach in fact is the size of a tennis court with sea defence walls built to stop the sea pounding away the rooms that they have close to where the beach was!

He flew in from Porto Rico so they cannot deny knowledge of the situation there. We had not had a holiday in over 2 years and we were really looking forward to a complete chill out, walking on the beach type holiday but you cannot walk more that 30 yds in either direction.

Happily there wernt a lot of Americans there so it was relaxing for us not to have to babble or be babbled at! The food was pretty good, especially on theme nights. The Italian rest. was Fab! The Mexican rest. was not. We never went hungry.The weather was a bit unsettlted but good and hot and humid. Rain came in spurts and quickly went away. We did bring home some kind of sand fleas I suspect.( not bedbugs). When you return home wash ALL your clothes in HOT water and leave your suitcases outside while you do this. My huband put clean unused socks back into his drawer at home and got about 20 bites over his feet and ankles. At sunset on the beach we noticed little thing biting us.We were even treated to a complementary snorkelink trip aboard a catamaran that inluded lunch at an offsite rest. I know right!!The capain of the boat threw in the life preserver and hualed my 3 y.o. around with us in the water for 45 minutes!!! I've been to Mexico lots of time but the rest of my family had not. They all loved it and would go back in a second. I got a free massage by listening to the sales pitch and it was the best massage ever by Mike. In the Spa room not on the beach.There were some topless sunbathers but the kids didnt even notice nor did I.. until my Husband brought each one to my attention.

I travelled alone and found the hotel, resort and area of playacar extremely safe and even travelled up to cancun on the local bus with ease. Local taxis from the hotel to playa del carmen are fixed at 5 dollars or you can walk in 20 mins. Well worth a visit with great shops and restaurants. Try the blue parrot for lunch, overlooks the beach and lobster tail a steal at \u00a313! Local buses to cancun are about 360 pesos (\u00a31.80 each way) and takes about 1 hour and a quarter. The hotel is exceptionally clean is all areas and sits in lovely well kept gardens. The rooms are in blocks so nicely dotted accommodation around the grounds with pretty thatched roofs. Be warned though if you are upstairs in the thatched roof roooms as you will hear EVERYTHING from next door!!! Some have two double beds and others a supersize king bed or at least thats what it felt like. Rooms have a fridge, tv with lots of spanish or american channels, hairdryer which is functional and an iron an iron board if you need them. They supply fresh towels daily along with bottle of water - usually more than you need! Shampoo and shower gel as well in the bathroom although you need to provide your own conditioner. Restaurants were fine although would say that both my experiences to the Italian and the Mexican were great. The food was good and ala carte. The main restaurant serves buffet style and although every day it is a bit samey there is always lots to choose from. For the fussy eaters that just like to complain perhaps you should just stay at home or better still eat out and not book an all inc. I wonder what some of them eat at home! There are 2 pools, one is at the back of the pool/snack bar area and quite quiet and relaxing, the other is between the pool bar and the beach and thats where all the games/activities happen and you hear the activity team over the mike from10am to 5pm. Just a hint.....don't lie on the left if you don't like to get smoke from the barbeque all over you. Activity team are all friendly and organise several trips up to cancun nightclubs or local nightclubs in playacarmen. If they take you to \"Cocobongo\" you should have a great night...worth the bus trip (1 hour and a quarter) but if its \"The City\" unless you like techno pumping music give it a miss! Local club in playa called the Mambo Cafe was a fun night with mixed disco and also 10 piece live band. Salsa, mambo if you like to dance go along. The beach has been a bit hit by the last hurricane but they are working hard to improve and started to look great when I left. Just past the hideaway next door you can actually take a long walk along the beach so get past there and you're sorted. The only downside to this hotel is it was very quiet when I was there so after the show (which I didn't really watch much) everyone disappeared to the rooms or someone so the bars at night were almost empty! I had a great time and everyone of the staff were extremely friendly and couldn't do enough for you. Reception went out of their way to help, bar staff were always attentive and the housekeeping staff were very creative with the towels.

If you like to eat healthier - do no stay here. Don't get me wrong, I was on vacation and ate pretty bad, but after 5 days of it you start to feel sick with all the grease. We found that when my husband went up to get the drinks they would pour lesser shots then when I went up. The front desk staff were HORRIBLE and treated us like crap when we declined the timeshare (which we were pushed into attending, DEFINATLY not something I wanted to do on my first day in Mexico) The staff who are in charge of the attractions were amazing, very knowledgable and incrediably helpful. The massage I paid $130 bucks for was a joke. The worst part about the massage was that I was tricked into getting 2. The lady told me that since I was getting their deluxa massage, I got another one included in the price. After I had the second massage however she told me I had to pay $50 bucks for it. I was really upset and when I went to management about it, they made me feel even worse since they said the staff member who booked the appointment had to pay for it!!!!! So I paid anyways, even though I knew it was probably a con. Like most people said, the beach is gone but that's not the hotels fault so I will not really talk about that. They are making efforts to fix it =) My favorite part was the 10 min walk into Playa Del Carmen - very beautiful and there was tons of shopping and things to see. It's a very safe walk since there is people (tourists) everywhere. If you are spending more than $700 per person for a week to stay here, DON'T.

I had a great time! The accomodations, while not 5-star, were a supurb value for the money. My room was always clean and functional. The bed was firm, but I brought my own pillow and slept fine. I arrived to a fruit basket and got cool folded towels every day (swan, elephant, pig - weird and fun!). The beach is coming back, and there was plenty to hang out on, under huge thatch 'umbrellas' - the sun was intense some days. The sand is white, clean and the water a beautiful opaque Carabbean turquoise, at a constant refreshing 85 degrees. The food is as good as a buffet can be at an all-inclusive place like this - I've read reviiews from others and all I have to say is that they should chill - if food is your priority, try the buffet or the (excellent) pool-side food bars. If you don't like these, there are dozens of great restrauants $5 away by taxi. To expect fine dining at this price might be a little optomistic. I ate three nights at the hotel, and three nights in near-by Playa Del Carmen. The best part is that I did not contract any stomach problem my whole trip - a first for me in Mexico. Unlike the West Coast, Cancun has a steady breeze as well so I had zero problems with bugs - even while golfing. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE of my trip was the taxi service to and from the Airport. The 'Grey Line' monopoly apparently now charges whatever they want. I was told by the hotel beforehand that the fare is about $40 one way. I picked up a Frommers 2008 nook, which also quoted $40. At 9:30pm, when I arrived, I was told $82, period. That was their 'car / evening charge', since vans 'did not travel' at night. I was told to look for a car outside the terminal. After I paid (with a credit card) I went outside to fine only vans. I rode with another similaraily gouged person down the coast to my hotel. The hotel concieairge rolled his eyes when I told him this story, and told me that since I paid by Amex, I would be able to contest the charge. On the way back I purposely took $40 American with me for the trip, which is what the hotel told me to do. After we left the driver said $50 American, I told him I had only $40, so he drives me to an ATM!! I took out $100 pesos (about 8 bucks and change at the time), and said he could have my $40 American and the $100 pesos, or I'd walk back to the hotel. He grumbled and didn't say a word for the 45 minute drive. Having this one dark spot on an otherwise brilliant vacation was unfortunate - everyone at the hotel and surrounding areas were so nice. I snorkeled, ate and drank like a pig, went golfing, and hung out with abandon. I will definately go again and again.

We loved the location, but there was NO BEACH, due to the the Hurricanes. We have been to Cancun many times and this was the worst. I rate it like I would a Motel6. The rooms were noisy and none of the 5 roomes we had had proper screens for the many misquitos that will make into your room. The walls look roten and nicked up and nothing ever looks clean. When we went down to get in the water. It was full of wires and pumps, due to sand pumping. It ruined the beach experince and we couldn't really go swimming. The liquor is generic and mostly in walmart looking plastic bottles. Bottled water was hard to come by and if you wanted any at all, you had to chase down the housekeeping people and beg for it. They have NO ROOM SERVICE, BEACH SERVICE, OR POOL SERVICE. Basicly NO SERVICE. You have to get everything for yourself and everything tasted so bad, it was caffateria food gone wrong. We stayed with a group of 10 people. ALL OF US BECAME VERY SICK, including my six year old daugther. from the buffet style of food. At one point I was consiedring being hospitalized. They have 2 resturants that only serves buffet suprise every meal. All of the food is nasty. They try to cater to Americans, by not serving mexican food. We came to Mexico to eat great mexican food and got none. You are allowed to eat at the Italian resturant and mexican resturant only once during your stay. They were both ok. I would have been happy to eat at Mcdonalds instead of their very scary buffets. When I tried to ask for late check out the front desk person requested a personal tip and if I didn't they weren't going to give it to me. That was so tacky. The staff seems underpaid because, if you ask for anything as little as a straw, they tell you it will take them about 30 minutes and then they will ignore you for next time if you don't tip them everytime. It's awfull. At this resort you feel like a second class citizen, esspecially if you do not own a timeshare. They say no to most reasonable requests. Their internet was always down. Please for the saftey of your children don't bring them here, because they will get sick!

You are met with a welcome drink and walked to your room. Your luggage follows shortly after Rooms I would recommend asking for a ground floor room. The upper floors have thatched roofs and are apparently very musty and damp. The standard room is set up with a bed/seating area with a television and mini-bar, and then a seperate area in which there is a wardrobe and mirror. We thought the rooms were nicely decorated, but the bathrooms could perhaps do with a little updating. We liked the terrace area with tables/chairs and a hammock. We had no problems with air conditioning. The hotel provide an iron, ironing board and hairdryer, so you have no need to pack any of those items. There is a safe in the room which is free of charge too. We spent little time in the room, we would watch tv (The Warner channel!) while getting ready for the evening, it was adequate for our needs. GHD hair straighteners do not work, due to the voltage in Mexico - you are better off taking a cheaper pair & leaving them to heat up. Pool/Beach There is an activity pool, and a larger pool. There is always something going on at the activity pool e.g. volleyball, water polo, aquarobics. There is also a bar area within this pool, which is nice. The other pool is more for sunbathing/relaxation. It is generally not as busy. The beach is badly affected by recent storms, but the sandbags were fun to sit on and there are still enough loungers for people to enjoy the beach. Food & Drink Breakfast: Every type of pastry you can imagine, a toast machine is available, lots & lots fresh fruit, cereal, juices, smoothies, continantal style breakfast, eggs, sausages,. The coffee served at breakfast is delicious. Lunch: Lunch is sometimes served at the buffet, but mainly served at the snackbar near the pool. They have a barbeque going from about 11am - 3pm at which fish, beef, hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken, pork and even barbequed vegetables are served. There is also the snack bar for salads, natchos, pasta and various other meal options. Dinner: Served at the buffet or A la Carte restaurants (Italian & Mexican). We did not enjoy the Mexican so much but the Italian food was amazing. The Buffet also have theme nights, e.g. Oriental, mexican etc. There is a carvery with chicken and beef, pasta, various salads, lots of types of bread, chips, hotdogs for the kids, chicken and beef marinaded, potatoes..there seemed to be something for everyone. Pizzaria: There is a Pizzaria by the pool area open all day with many different pizza types, this was good for a snack or light lunch. Drink: The drinks were amazing. Named brands and a lovely cocktail menu. I recommend the Mai Tais. Self serve pepsi and fruit punch machine for non-alcoholoic refils during the day. The barstaff will also bring drinks to you while you sunbathe. I never had a problem with the bar queue Entertainment There are various types of entertainment during the day including xcooking competitions and water activities. We mainly relaxed during the day at the other pool so can't really comment on this, but the entetainment at night was fun - there is a large stage and seating area. We saw many shows (Mexican Hacienda, Carribean Show, Mr Allegro) and the costumes, lighting music and dancing are very professional. I enjoyed and thought that the staff worked very hard to make the shows entertaining. Disco/Bars The disco was a disappointment. the Disco plays bizarre music asuch as 'YMCA' and 'In The Navy'. It is also very small and not at all like a disco/nightclub. It does open until 2am though. Usually, we would go out for the meal, watch the Show, and then go to the Amber Bar (next to Reception) and then back to the room with drinks. If you are hoping for a resort with an exciting night-scene, this may not be the hotel for you. There is a nightclub tour to Cancun you can go on for $50 however. I think that runs once a week. Staff I found all the staff to be brilliant. We could not fault the maid service (and their towel origami!) and when we phoned for a repair, a repairman was at the apartment within ten minutes. The waiters and barstaff cannot do enough for you, and the gardners are constantly maintaining the land. The Animation Team are fun. They work at the pool all day and then at the night shows too. The only staff I have an issue with are the Reception staff. They are rude and often unwilling to help with problems. All in all we had a wonderful holiday and found it to be better than the 5* in Mexico (Bahia Principe, Tulum) we went to last year.

The front desk could care less about your complaints. We told them we were leaving and they didn't even bother to try to stop us. They tried to have me sign off on a form that said we left voluntarily \"not because of anything wrong with the hotel.\" I crossed out that line and wrote that the hotel itself was the reason.

It was a very pretty resort, the grounds are kept up very well. The staff for the most part was very friendly also. The taxi ride into town was $5.00, or it's a 20-30 min walk. There is no beach really because of the hurricane, they are working on fixing it though. There are 2 pools, 1 has a swim up bar that it seemed only 1 bartender was ever at. You had to get out of the pool and walk around to get served. The food was average. Nothing special, but if you ate in town somewhere it was very expensive.(even for a couple of tacos and beer). The Italian rest was very good though. They have shows nightly that were OK, it passed the time. The clubs in town didn't get busy until 10 or 11PM. I recommend the Fire show at the Blue Parrot. It says it starts at 10p but it never started earlier than 1130. Also they say they have a LADIES night but they had only 1 bartender for the girls and the line was so long it wasn't worth the wait. We changed rooms 3 times while we were there due to A/C problems, other people at the resort had the same issues and also had to keep changing rooms. We had to ask them several times to replace our shampoo and soap when we ran out. We did actually enjoy Playa, it was a very beautiful town so we stayed 2 days longer. They helped us change our reservations at the hotel but didn't ever tell us what time we were supposed to leave out(even after 6 or 7 attempts to get an answer) The day of our departure we almost missed our flight because they never told us what time to leave.

The room is not luxury but it is clean and plenty bigger than what you would get in NY City. Besides, we were hardly in our rooms. The activity staff is phenomenal! We loved that we could participate in the many activites (ping pong, balloon toss, bingo, dance lessons, aqua aerobics, etc.) at the \"party\" pool or relax more at the quieter pool. The staff was very nice and friendly. The grounds were pretty and immaculate. The beach was small but didnlt bother us. We prefer the pool anyway. 5th Avenue was fun and close for only a $5 cab fare. We felt safe staying out until 3 or 4 in the morning at the clubs and eating at a late night taco restaurant before heading back to the resort. There was always staff walking the grounds that late also. I would recommend the \"Fire Show\" at the Blue Parrot on 5th Avenue. It is at 11:30 pm and it is a cool show on the beach. You can have drinks while you wait. What is more perfect? Overall, we really liked the Allegro Playacar and would definitely go back. We have even recommended it to friends already!

Housekeeping staff do a great job of keeping the rooms clean. When you do get a drink. It's generally good quality a bit weak but overall good. Recreational Activities are SUPERB! The BEST cappuccino (in the main buffet room I ever had) I liked that in the main buffet room there is a different theme everyday for dinner. Ex: Mexican, French, Chinese, Etc. Dislikes: You will live out of your luggage. There are NO drawers to put your clothes. The room is not very big. If 4 people are staying in the double bedded room it will be a VERY tight fit. There is half a shower door. So water tends to spill on the floor. Staff do make you feel as if they should be tipped for serving you any little thing. (Even though my tipping fee was included in my package) I still spent over 200.00 US dollars in tipping the staff for the week. The Mexican and The Italian the two seperate restaurants which need a 24 hour reservation are not worth the reservation or the wait. The food is NOT great. Your Best bet is the buffet. The 90 minute tour is excruciating. My husband and I were there well over 2 hours and when you say NO a hundred times another person (the manager) comes and talks to you for another 15 minutes. The sales people aren't really pushy. They just don't take no for an answer. Geckos EVERYWHERE in your room, outside your room, all around the resort. Instead of who let the dogs out.. The slogan of Allegro should be who let the Geckos out. Do not under any circumstances do the parasailing (you have to purchase it next to the rec. stand by the pool) I paid over 300.00 US dollars supposedly for a 12 minute parasail. We were up there 5 minutes and brought back down. Supp. Because we were the last ones to go up and they were closing. Bring a cell phone that can call outside of Mexico. It will cost you a small fortune to call the US. I paid 4.00 US dollars just to connect the call and then a 1.00 US a minute. Do not buy an international phone card in the USA it doesn't work in Mexico. Bar service is very slow. Especially at the pool. I waited over 20 minutes for a drink.

However, the next day we were moved to a better room which fullfilled our requests. The rooms weren't incredibley large, but we were never in them during the day. The showers are not enclosed, so water typically spills onto the floor. The staff was very friendly and everyone spoke very good english, along with several other languages. My teenage daughters also found the male employees to be quite attractive. The food was good depending on the day. They served different food for every night of the week, some nights better than others. The pool side entertainment was great, along with the hotel's nightly shows. We were rather impressed by the various perfomances we saw each night. The hotel also has a kids club which hosted activities for kids all day nad all night in order to keep the younger guests entertained. One of the drawbacks to the hotel is their timeshare presentation which lasts three or more hours, despite the promised ninety minutes.

There's a reason the resort rates 3.5 stars rather than 4 or 5, and if you are willing to spend the extra you'll probably be glad you did. (As an aside, American Airlines was a nightmare in both directions. Think carefully before flying them to anywhere in Mexico). Here's what we liked: - The grounds were very pretty, well landscaped, gave a nice tropical feel - The pools were clean and spacious, great for frequent dips to cool off from the heat. - The ocean is absolutely beautiful with shades of green and blue, and it was shallow enough to walk out and swim by the beach. Also great to hang out at night under the stars. - We took the $33 USD snorkeling trip which leaves from the next hotel over - fun trip, just to swim around with a mask and see some colorful fish. - The bartenders make good pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris. - The breakfast buffet was usually quite good. We liked being able to have an omelet made to order, the authentic Mexican beans are very tasty, we liked the various sausages and meats, and were surprised that the instant decaf coffee tasted good - We liked some dinner buffets but not all. Be warned that the \"Intercontinental\" buffet night is code for leftovers, and that the chefs tried hard but couldn't make Asian dishes work. Also they didn't seem to grasp what Americans mean by salad. On the other hand, the ice cream was fun and plentiful. - One word: tiramasu. Fabulous, unbelievably good, better than what we've had at good Italian restaurants in the US. Imagine how excited we were that it showed up at the buffets the next day. - The air conditioning in the room was a life saver - we set it to a low temperature and kept it (and the ceiling fan) on nonstop the whole week. - The staff were helpful and friendly. American Airlines was terrible in both directions, including losing our luggage on the trip to Playa. The hotel staff helped us call and reach the slippery luggage staff at American to ensure our bags were delivered. They also helped us call the van company that took us to and from the airport to confirm our return trip. - The games at the main pool were cheesy but harmless. I played water polo with other guests most days - We liked walking to the shopping center a few minutes away. Disappointments included: - There is very little actual beach. We knew this from Trip Advisor reviews before coming, but it still surprises you in person. Especially since most of the nearby hotels have substantially more beach left than the Allegro. - The hotel does a terrible job of making sure guests can get chairs by the pool. There just aren't enough chairs period, and literally by 7:30 am people have saved all the good chairs with umbrellas by both pools and on the beach. This is despite the signs that say 'please don't save spots.' For much of the day the saved seats are empty, because the savers are elsewhere, but tough luck for everyone else. We resorted to sending one of us out to save seats in the morning when we first woke up - annoying and not what you should have to do on vacation. - The photographers were too persistent coming around with their iguana and parrot and lemur and pushing you to have photos taken. Several times they would not just take 'no' for an answer and we had to waste time fending them off. - In a similar vein, the onsite tour salespeople were pushy and irritating. Our first morning a woman named Marisol followed us into the gift shop to try to strike up a conversation. It took several minutes for her to bug off. The next day she chased us down again after breakfast, and tried to guilt us into talking by using a cheap sales ploy \"I'm getting the idea you don't want to talk to me.\" My fiancee had to put up with her for several minutes. When you're paying for a vacation you shouldn't have that kind of treatment. She finally got the message and left us alone. - The restaurant reservation requirement was just silly. We had to reserve several nights in advance, at an earlier time than we wanted. Then at both the Mexican and the Italian, we were one of 2-3 tables in an otherwise empty room. It appeared to be similar all week when we peered in. - The irony is that the restaurant food is mediocre after all that. Beautifully presented but little worth tasting. - The cable TV had only a few channels, mostly in Spanish. It would have been nice to have more when we were in for a siesta to escape the afternoon heat. - The room was adequate but nothing special.

The staff really goes out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and taken care of; they also tend to be extremely friendly and good-humored. The grounds are clean and well manicured, the rooms have all the necessities. The group I was with consisted of 8 singles (both guys and gals) who enjoy a loud, crazy time with booze flowing and new friends to be made. We met new people at the resort, but there did not to be another group like ours staying at the resort (which was a huge surprise to us). We enjoyed the all-inclusive situation, and took advantage of the free drinks during the day, but had to take a cab into Playa del Carmen to find the type of environment that we were looking for at night. We had a great time, but I think one of the other resorts would have been better suited for us. A few of the places we visited in town were the Blue Parrot, Coco Maya, Bali, Santanera and Senor Frogs. Blue Parrot and Coco Maya are right next door to each other and offer similar environments. Both are on the beach, have two dance floors, a separate VIP area upstairs and a good turnout of visitors from all over the planet. They both also offer quieter areas where you can relax and talk, and I recommend checking them out. The fire show at the Blue Parrot is also worth seeing. Bali is a big nightclub with loud music, lots of locals and a good looking crowd. Drinks are reasonably priced for the environment, and you can negotiate with the doorman to get around the cover charge (say you are going to go elsewhere if you have to pay cover, and be willing to do it). Santanera is right across the street from Bali and appeared to be almost entirely a local crowd; while most places in Playa close at 4am, both Bali and Santanera are open until 6. Senor Frogs was very disappointing and the barkeeps were very uninclined to provide change (I had to request change after giving $40 USD for a $28 tab). I was expecting an entirely different environment (with more excitement) and would not return. Sports betting is legal in Mexico, and Playa has a race and sports book called Caliente that wasn't bad. It is in the shopping center at the south end of 5th, caddy-corner from Carlos & Charlie's. I don't bet much on baseball or horses, so my visit was more to check things out in case I am back in the area during football and/or basketball season.

As far as the rooms, yes they are on the smaller side and the beds are a little hard, but still comfortable. The beach is small, but there is still plenty of room and lounge chairs were always available at the beach and at the pools. The kids shows each evening were great. The food was good and varied. The Mexican theme night was especially fun since the buffet was moved outside and there was entertainment throughout dinner. My only complaint was the lack of air conditioning in the buffet restaurant. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was the fact that they advertised an air conditioned dining room. The room was there, but it was never open. We inquired about this and were told that they only used the air conditioned dining room when the hotel was at 100% capacity, and this never happened during our stay.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent,United Kingdom.", "Title": "\u201cLoved Our Stay At The Allegro.\u201d", "Author": "Gravesy166", "ReviewID": "UR7835696", "Content": "Stayed for 7 nights early June and the Wife and I loved every minute of it.The hotel grounds are truly stunning and kept in immaculate condition.The gardeners are forever working to keep the place spotless.The rooms are very clean and the air conditioning was excellent.The beds are huge and all the complaints about the hard mattress are nonsense.It's firm but very comfortable.The towel arrangements are a nice touch.

We had great time there. The only thing I would say ruined our vacation was the rain. I rained every single day except for the last day we were there. We still enjoyed the pools (they have 2) and the activities despite the rain, we tried to make of it the best that we could. The food was really good and they give you aot of variety. I felt like everything was pretty fresh, the desserts were delicious! The rooms were were decent but after a few days I felt like they smelled of mildew. The cleaning ladies did a great job and they left us a mermaid made out of a towel which my daughter loved! It is close to the plaza and La Quinta avenida, about a 20 minute walk or a $5 cab ride. THere you can find markets, a mcdonalds, starbucks and other american stores like american apparel and diesel. The souvenier prices are very expensive so its best to buy from street vendors because you can negociate. Take the ferry to cozumel, its $20 dollars per person, round trip and it is very fun and a chance to do something else. One thing i didnt like was that the resort did not have a kiddie pool. our three year old wanted to spent her time in the water and it made it difficult because we had to stay there constantly with her. the beach is a bit non existant but not as bad as I thought. you can go to playa del carmen ($5 cab fare) and they have a beautiful beach. The staff is amazingly sweet and attentive. Israel is funny and always energetic even if its 8 in the morning. My favorite thing of the resort were the shows at night. They were fabolous! They have one every night at about 9:30 and they are incredibly well prepared, entertaining and the costumes are beautiful. They have a great time of dancers, my favorite one was Luz Maria from spain. They also have a kids show at 8:30, my daughter looked foward to participating every night. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Oh, the last thing, I would have liked their to have been more activities during the time it was raining. If anyone stayed at this hotel during may 27-june 1st we would love to hear from your experience at allegro.

Since we were honeymooners, we made sure our travel agent alerted the hotel as such so that we could take advantage of the complimentary honeymoon priveledges the hotel offers. It's not much, but the hotel gives you a priority checkin (which we think was the representative escorting us through the property to our room), fruit basket, spa services discount, and breakfast in bed one morning. It was all perfect. Once we checked in, we were escorted to our room to wait for our bags to arrive. Well, we were starving, so we just took off to the pool to find some snacks. On the way there, we passed by The Pizzaria which was great! The pizza was hot, fresh, and tasty! After our quick slice, we headed over to the Snack Bar. OK - where I come from, \"snacks\" are things like chips, fries, chicken nuggest - you know, small portions of finger foods. Nope! This place lays out a whole spread at the snack bar. It was great! Everyday we noticed that there was always a beef, chicken, pork, fish, and vegetarian entree choice plus a potato dish, pasta dish, and a steamed vegetable. There was a full salad bar to make your own fresh salads and a grill off to the side which served fresh burgers, hot dogs, and a chicken or pork dish plus french fries. Oh yeah, there was a mini nacho bar with chips, cheese sauce, fresh pico de gallo, fresh guacamole, and cevice. It was great! After our first \"snack\", we headed back to our room to unpack and change into our swimsuits. Once down at the pool, the real relaxation began. (We opted to hang out at the activities pool everyday. We may not necessarily be the type to participate in every activity offered, but we certainly enjoy watching everyone else participate. Music is played at the activity pool and there's a swim-up bar there as well.) We hung out at the pool for a while then went to the lobby to try to make dinner reservations. I don't particularly agree with the whole reservation scheme since you're only given a choice of 600pm, 730pm, or 900pm to dine. I've been to much larger all-inclusives in the past that have ala carte restaurants and they use a first-come first-served seating policy that works just fine. You go when you want to eat then decide if you feel like waiting for a table or not. I guess it didn't much matter with our stay at the Allegro since we were able to get a reservation at our preferred time (730pm) each time we tried. Of the two ala carte menus, I preferred the menu at The Mexican over the menu at The Italian, though the food at both places was outstanding. We ate at the main buffet for the Oriental night and we also ate at the Mexican Fiesta. All of the food was delicious. Neither me nor my husband had anything we didn't like. Don't get me wrong, we're not talking gourmet-quality here, but it was all good. So, regarding our room. It was large, clean, and beautiful. We decided to go for a garden-view room since we knew we'd be spending every day-light hour at the pool enjoying the view AND the fresh air! Plus, it looked like all of the ocean-view rooms were situated near the pool and you know how water carries sound! We were assigned in building 41 which was just perfect. Right about in the middle between the pool and the main buffet. I will have to agree with some other reviews that the beds are a little hard but it is NOT due to the cement platform. They are just FIRM mattresses on the beds. The cement platforms are to help with hurricane rebuilding, not the \"cheap Mexican shortcut\" that others have claimed it to be. The vanity seemed to be newly remodeled with a fashionable bowl-style sink and round-framed mirror. The closet area could use drawers instead of shelves, but we didn't have any problem finding space for all of our things (10-days worth!). The bathroom houses only the toilet and tub/shower. Its just the right size for what you need to do in there. We had a second-story room which meant we had amazing cathedral ceilings all the way to the top of the palapa roof. If I had to guess, I'd say those ceilings are at least 25-30 feet tall! Truly magnificent. On our front porch was a hammock (which came in handy for siesta time) and a small table with 2 chairs. The whole set-up was really cool. There are only 8 rooms to each building (4 on the bottom and 4 on the top) and that gives the whole hotel a village-like feel. The grounds of this property were absolutely immaculate. I've included pictures so you can see for yourself because I'm not really sure how to describe it without sounding redundant. I've also included pics of the lobby building which the hotel fails to show on their website. I don't know why cuz the lobby is beautiful. Also, this staff was one of the friendliest staffs we've ever had the pleasure of being served by. Anytime we passed a staff member walking about the grounds, we were greeted with eye contact, a smile, and the appropriate verbal greeting for the time of day. We also liked the staff uniforms. They were neatly pressed and professional looking but also carried a tropical vibe. It was our first stay at an Occidental property, but if this is how they maintain all of their resorts, we'll look for an Occidental the next time we take a vacation. We only had 3 small annoyances. They really are quite petty as none of them had ANY bearing on our ability to enjoy our vacation. Here they are: 1. THE TIME SHARE HASSLE: We were approached by a rep on our first morning to attend the \"VIP Breakfast\". We've traveled around enough to know that the hotel staff doesn't want to eat with their guests just for the heck of it, and we didn't suddenly become a \"VIP\" out of no where and for no reason. If you can't realize that, then I'm sorry for you. If you're not interested in hearing their pitch, politely tell the rep that you are there to spend time with your family, husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, friends, or whomever you're there with and you would prefer not to deviate from your plans. It worked for us and we didn't hurt anyone's feelings or act like those \"Ugly Americans\" everyone expects us to be. 2. THE PHOTOS WITH ANIIMALS: The hotel has a professional photographer on site that goes around and takes pics throughout the day. If you've ever been on a cruise, it's kind of like that, only each day they bring in some kind of exotic animal and push for you to have your picture taken with it. They don't want to seem to take \"no\" for an answer, so I found that telling them I was allergic seemed to steer them away successfully. You don't have to pay them to take the picture, only if you want a print out. 3. NOISE FROM THE ROOM NEXT DOOR: As I said before, we were on the second floor with those amazing cathedral ceilings. Well, on our second to last night, a family with a BABY was checked in to the room next to us. We quickly learned of the disadvantage of the palapa roof - no effective sound barrier. At times it sounded like that darn baby was laying in bed with us. Fortunately, the baby didn't cry too often or for too long so we were able to still enjoy ourselves. There were times that we could hear our neighbors conversations and TV clear as day, but that was only when we were in our room which was not very often. *NOTE: The beaches of Playacar (and much of the Caribbean coast of Mexico) were severely damaged at the hands of Hurricane Wilma in 2005. The government is doing the best they can to assist Mother Nature in rebuilding the beach. REMEMBER - THE LACK OF BEACH SAND IS NOT THE HOTEL'S FAULT! That said, there is still plenty of soft white sand and chaise lounge chairs to go around. Enjoy it and save your complaints for things that the hotel CAN control.", "Date": "June 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "rhode island", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, no beach \u201d", "Author": "bertal", "ReviewID": "UR7709585", "Content": "Food was fine for all nationalities, from spicy to mild choices at all meals.

It has 2 pools, 1 Italian restaurant, 1 Mexican and a buffet restauant at the main resort building plus a buffet each day at the swimming pool building. We just got back April 21, 2007. We traded through RCI which worked out for us this time. We were listed for a hotel room, but we got a mini suite with 2 rooms. This is part of the \"first club\" owners suites. I think we got the upgrade becasue they didn't have us registered at the resort for check in. But, always bring your confirmation letter that is your only proof from RCI. One room had a king size bed,television, closet, vanity sink and a bathroom. The other room had a sofa, television, sitting area, full bath, closet and a fully stocked wet (alcohol) bar. Yes, the bed frame is made out of concrete, but the mattress is fine. We stayed in another resort two years ago with the same bed design. Easy to rebuild after a hurricane. Our building was located on the 2nd row which made an easy one minute walk to the beach. This resort is so quaint most units are an easy walk down to the pool or beach. Unlike, the mega resorts where you have to take a shuttle to the restaurants or beach. All the food is good. If you get tired of the food on the property, you can walk downtown to Playa Del Carmen and try a variety of restaurants and bars. The walk is about 20 minutes away. It's a safe walk or a 5 dollar taxi ride. If you eat at the night time buffet, you have to ask for the waiter EDGAR CRUZ. He's great! We sat in his section every night. You can even ask for him on the nights they have the dinner shows. He's very professional, quick, remembers your drink orders every night, and he'll give you a spanish lesson during dinner. He made are dinners! The resort has worked very hard to maintain the beach. Heavy storms and erosion has taken much of the beach. Not just at this resort, but at all of the resorts up this stretch of Mexico. They have the most beach based on the number of rooms per each resort. In two weeks, they will start a beach rebuilding program. They will bring sand from the ocean to rebuild the sitting and walking part of their beach. Resort employees say they should gain 30 feet of new beach. I ask them to post pictures on their website for potential visitors. We laid out on the beach every day, only about 5 feet from the water. You can't beat that! Plenty of things to do, on and off the property. Just ask the front desk activities director. You don't need a car, taxi's right out front. Tip: When you arrive at the airport, just walk by all the baggage handlers that would like to carry your bags to a taxi.(For a Tip) Walk out front of the airport and grab a taxi yourself. A regular taxi car, not a van, should cost you $45.00 dollars to the resort. A van will cost you around $65.00 dollars for 2/4 people. I haven't had time to upload pictures into the computer. The other people who posted pictures did a great job of capturing the property. It's a beautiful property. If you want a fancy, posh and crowded resort, this is not for you.

We had a fabulous time at the resort everyone was so friendly I brought a welcome gift for the maid a set of Rosary beads and a sterling silver belt and she also got tips she was very happy her name was flora a sweetheart. I would definately go back the breakfasts were super anything you wanted was there. We tipped the girl making eggs too at the end Lita she was also very nice. I took 350 dollars in singles and they worked out great so remember to take dollar bills. We went over to town to the beach one day but the beach right there was just as good. The hotel packed a lunch and sodas or beers whatever you want for free 6 of each. I took cancun express from the airport it was 95 for two in a private van it was very very pleasant and they were very professional. Bought crocs(35 plus charms 3.50) sandals the hottest shoe in the UK now and bought a leather duffle at Playacar for 104, at the airport it was 300 dollars great deal at the golden duck in Playacar.

The beach was lovely so how you imagine the caribbean to be. The grounds were beautiful especially if you are a plant lover, they are very well kept. The beds are fine you are only sleeping there after all. The rooms are a wee bit musty but again its the humidity, you get used to it after a day or 2. They are clean and that is the main thing, The hammock on the balcony is great fun especially after a few drinks. Oh and the drinks are certainly not watered down,I found this out very quickly. No mini bar in the room though, so what you just bring your drinks up with you. The Barstaff get to know you and if you give them the odd tip soon get to know your drink and have it on the bar for you before you even ask for it, they are brill. We had planned to go on a few trips but never done it you really dont need to leave the resort. The entertaining staff work so hard day and night. We had the odd storm but do you know what so what.

We participated in stretching classes, water aerobics, water volleyball, water balloon fight, horseshoes, bingo, beer drinking, waitering competition, latin dancing, paella making, and had a great time at each one. The shows at night are great, the dancers are very talented and professional.

The hotel staff were great and the food was quite good with lots of choices. You cannot complain about the quality and selection. The rooms really need refurbishing and our room , which was closer to the ocean , had a musty smell. The ceiling in the bathroom area dripped from the airconditioner above us, so we learned to not waste a lot of time in front of the mirror or you would end up wet.The pool activities were good and the bar staff were eager to please. They made every tropical drink you ever heard of . I saw a number of guests will their own large insulated mugs and the bartenders filled them up without hesitation. A group of partiers bought their own American beer in town, and just had their 5 gallon bucket filled regularly with ice. The beer on tap is corona. The beach is basically non existent due to the rising water level and the heavy winds. The main pool, located overlooking the ocean is damaged and will need to be repaired again. We were told that it was damaged in January and was already repaired once. The entertainment is amateurish but fun. My only real complaint is the sales tactics used to sell time shares. You could end up giving up most of a day of your vacation being toured and talked up. We didn't participate and returned their free offers to attend the information session. We initially thought that the staff were going to tour us around the property and provide a small orientation to the resort but this was not the intention. The resort brings in crafts, artwork and jewellery a few times so you don't have to take the trip off the resort to buy souvineers if you don't feel like it. We went off a few times to shop in town on what they call \"Fifth Avenue\". Lots of stores and bars. We ate at the Italian speciality restaurant and I had the shrimp with lobster sauce and it rate a 10 in my opinion. One evening they featured a quitarist in the bar opposite the dining room and this guy was good. He played a lot of the Gypsy Kings and I was drawn away from my dinner to go and listen.

I have travelled extensively and have stayed at 5.5* places. This place was friendly and the service was wonderful (better than at the Riu Palace in Cancun!). The entertainment staff do a good job, especially one guy (I will attach his photo since not sure of his name). You can tell he loves his job, and he chats with everyone. He was so excited I won a snorkel trip, more excited than me! He remembered our names and would always stop to talk. They add fun twists to the contests, such as belly flops into the pool if you lose the beer chugging contest, and kayak relay races in the pool (using your hands). Some of the enterainment staff are a bit arrogant, but most are very nice. Tito (spelling?) who wears the skirts acted like we were bothering him for a photo. However, he is very brave to be wearing skirts everyday! We went to the sister hotel in Xcaret (the Grand Flaminco) for one night, and it was gorgeous but huge! There were golf carts to bring people around cause it was so big. We found it too big, and were happy to come back to our little Allegro. They were overbooked so we volunteered to go over to Xcaret for 1 night. Food was good (buffets are always ho-hum everywhere you go), but there is an a la carte for lunch (in the buffet area), and an outdoor lunch BBQ everyday by the pool. There is a snack bar by the pool (nachos, tacos, salad etc). The snack bar closes at 4pm , but there is also a pizza bar till 5pm (thin crust and pretty good). They have a theme night (International I think) with a Fire Show, people on stilts etc, all the tables and food are outdoors (nice change). They also have a great outdoor Mexican Night (Mondays) with Mariache and other entertainers--fiesta! The buffet restaurant seems recently renovated and is one of the nicest I have seen. There are 2 a la cartes for supper, Mexican and Italian. We liked the Mexican better (we had fajitas and coconut shrimp) but the Italian is fancier (cream cheese bread is good!) but the shrimp had balsamic on them (strange!). There are also vendors at the resort at supper if you wish to purchase some souvenirs (not that much to chose from). Yes there are sandbags on the beach, they are everywhere (even at the posh resorts in the Playacar area). There is still about 3 rows of chairs, and a swim area. The resort has a shuttle to a beach in town and provides lunch and drinks (boxed lunches). We didn't bother. There is also a taped off area (only a small area) of the activities pool. Rooms are average, ones on top have thatched roofs (some like downstairs, depending on your taste). We had 2 rooms, and 1 was a weird shape, so if you don't like just ask for another. We also had to wait a day for a safe key (they ran out?!) so we had to carry all our valuables with us. Also, when we tried their 5* Xcaret resort, we were promised free tickets to the Xcaret park next door, this is only for 2 nights or more. Probably the guy wasn't lying but was confused. They also stuck us in a 1 king bedroom 2X, and we are 2 women. Logically, they should give us 2 beds (I even requested this upon booking and they didn't know anything about it). We had to wait another day to change rooms. These are only minor annoyances, and didin't ruin my trip but things you may want to be aware of. Also time share people are right outside the lobby (going towards the resort), and have a desk right there. All in all, great service, drinks were great (vodka, rum, kahlua, tequila, Corona etc etc) and so was the food and theme nights. Minor things like confusion at front desk were things I've gotten almost everywhere, and the service/friendliness outshadows this--I would definately go back. Furthermore, the service does not change in the absence of a tip. Sometimes we tipped and sometimes we didn't and it never made a difference in our treatment. Of course they thanked us and smiled when we tipped, they were appreciative. I haven't been to many resorts where I can say the treatment was the same even if I forgot my tip money in the safe! Also this resort is a 15-20 min walk to town (gorgeous!) or a $5 cab ride, there is also a resort mall 2 minutes down the road---all so convenient. Playacar is a gated resort area so you can walk around at night and feel safe.

The grounds at the Allergro are absolutelty beautiful, some of the prettiest weve seen, they should have more pictures of the grounds on their web-site. We had an upstairs room with a palapa roof. Room was average, we did have a issue with the screens, as they were torn and pulled out of the frame in areas. One call and Manuel from maintenance replaced them. We preferred having the windows open verses air conditioning in the evening. You will need a sense of adventure if you choose an upstairs room as there will be little lizards crawling about up high. They seem to stay up high and wont hurt you. There was no mold or musty odors, the bathroom did have a strong urine odor at first, but our maid Wilma took care of that.

We stayed for a week and then spent a week at the Gran Flamenco (also Occidental). Two very different experiences. We felt extremely comfortable at this resort. It's small and cozy. There are eight rooms per two level, thatch-roofed building. Ours was on the lower level of a building by one of the pools. Our room had two double beds; as we're a family of five we needed a cot brought in. Things got pretty crowded in there, but as we essentially only used the room for sleeping, personal maintenance, and storage of our luggage it was not a problem. Everything -- from our bedsheets to the little sugar packs for the coffee -- was slightly damp, but considering we were right on the ocean this wasn't surprising. My wife was bothered by a musty smell from the air conditioner. We just turned that off at dinner time, and by keeping the curtains closed during the day and the windows open at night we slept comfortably. The beds were firm, but that's the way we like them. The mirror by the sink had rust spots on it, as did the kinda goofy (but functional) room safe, but apart from that the room was clean. The bathtub/shower had no curtain or door but a small partition to keep the toilet and fresh towels from getting wet. It took a little finesse to keep everything else from getting wet in the bathroom, but taking short showers helped (the resort asks that you help to conserve water by minimizing shower times, so maybe this was by design). There was no fridge, but we got fresh bottles of water every day, and our room was cleaned and made up daily (including a new towel sculpture -- the kids loved this). Not sure if it made a difference but we left a small tip on a pillow every day. We also tipped at meals (10 or 20 pesos). The staff were all exceptionally friendly and courteous. I learned a touch of Spanish beforehand which the staff seemed to appreciate, even if mostly I just said \"gracias\" (not \"grashus\") and \"por favor\". The Kids Club was nice when my wife and I just wanted some time to ourselves; the staff played games with the kids, but mostly our kids wanted to play Playstation/Xbox or watch movies on the big screen TV. The food was good but not great, and while the selection is quite good we were getting tired of it after a week. The themed buffet dinners were a nice change, especially Mexican night which was quite an extravaganza, with the buffet moved outdoors and a mariachi band. For snacks, there was pizza (several kinds), hamburgers, hotdogs, salads, tacos, and tortillas... pretty standard fare, but very conveniently placed by the pools. The bars were well stocked and the bartenders knowledgeable. I suspect the drinks were a bit slim on the alcohol as no one (myself included) seemed to be experiencing particularly ill effects. They tasted good though, and as they're already paid for you just need to keep drinking to get where you're going. That said, I ate and ate and ate and only put on a couple of pounds so maybe it's something in the air. The one real criticism I have regarding drinks is when I asked for cerveza I got Corona. That was my only choice and I've developed a real distaste for it. Dos Equis is available everywhere in downtown Playa del Carmen, but Corona must have locked up beer rights at Occidental resorts because it was the only option. Both pools were fully functional (including the swim up bar) when we were there (Jan. 12 - 19, 2007). Lots of activities, and with the cozy setting everyone was getting involved in some way or other (if just throwing errant water balloons back at the people in the pool). There was still no beach, but we just walked over to a gate maybe fifty feet from our beach to the beach at the resort next door (beach chairs and facilities belong to the respective resort, but beaches are under federal jurisdiction). All the beaches in the area are in pretty sad shape, but when we wanted to swim in the ocean we did, and when we wanted to sun in chairs we did that by the pool. We wanted to get as much sun as possible, so we generally skipped the evening shows (which seemed alright if not particularly cultural), went to bed early, and got up with the sun before the kids. Older folks seemed to grab the poolside chairs earlier in the morning, with the young adults showing up to party in the afternoon. There was a nice international feel to the place: we met Canadians, Americans, French, and Italians (and, of course, Mexicans). The resort is essentially a long strip with facilities (pools, bars, tennis courts, etc.) running down the centre, so the faces became familiar and it was easy to meet people. The only real big negative was the lack of a laundry facility. They'll do laundry for you, but at prices like US$5 to wash a single shirt. We ended up taking our laundry into town and getting it done there. There's a laundromat (lavenderia) just past Calle 11 on 10 Avenida that washed all our clothes (a couple of kilograms worth) for 110 pesos. Even with the cab fare there and back to drop it off and again to pick it up, it's a bargain. It costs half that if you get out of the touristy part of town and find a place on 30 Avenida, and it's even cheaper if you load the washers and driers yourself. We would definitely come back here, and actually prefer it to the impressive (if a bit less friendly) Gran Flamenco. The deciding feature is definitely the friendly staff. From chatting with Ina and Remco at the front desk about their travels, to the buffet waiters who did cat impressions that had our kids looking under the tables, to the Kids Club staff that played with the kids, and the cheerful \"hola\" from every single staff member we passed, we never felt anything but welcome to this place.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "colorado", "Title": "\u201cA Super Choice!\u201d", "Author": "ColoradoTravelersx2", "ReviewID": "UR6641665", "Content": "We were more than pleased with the Allegro Playacar for our Jan18th-21st visit.

But beach chairs along the fence overlooking the ocean are sitting on sand and we went into the ocean from our little beach as well as the one to the north so we brought enough sand home to feel like we'd been at the beach! The staff was working hard to restore more of the beach but there's only so much they can do. The two story thatched roof \"houses\" holding only 8 rooms each was an intimacy you don't get with high rises and long corridors. The little porches for each room, complete with hammock, allowed you to feel like it was really home, complete with lovely tropical gardens. The atmosphere is casually upscale. The recreation and wait staff were always friendly and cheerful, and the shows are varied, entertaining, and fun.

Each day showed signs of much improvement and I give then credit for their efforts. The food was very good, and there was a good variety. The food at the activity pool from noon to 4 was delicious and plentiful and the staff were delightful. The drinks were great, the staff was extremely gracious and wanted only to please. They tried extremely hard to understand whatever language was spoken and I did not find it a barrier at all. The grounds were well taken care of.

Well let me tell you we had a great time. The rooms are what you see on the internet they are basically a bed, shower and dressing area it was fine. The rooms were kept clean, the maid service did our rooms two times a day so there was always fresh towels and little towel animals on your bed when you went in for the night. The air condition in the rooms were fine and the air quality in the room was fine. I recommend taking a candle to get rid of the musty smell you get when you stay in beach resorts. The food was decent and there always was something to do. We went with children and adults of all ages and no one was bored. The shows everynight were entertaining and they made the audience part of the shows. The pool area was clean, had plenty of lounges and the the activities were endless.

It was our first visit to the Rivera Maya. We\u2019d read about the problems with the beach so we were disappointed but prepared. Our plans included visiting Xel-Ha, Tulum, Xcaret, and Chichen Itza. We enjoyed the pool at the resort and public beach in Playa del Carmen. Location - The hotel is in a great location, easy walk into town. We saw the beach shuttle but didn\u2019t take it. Rooms -We were lucky to get a first floor room in a building right by the pool. We really liked the separate buildings. I just stayed at the Gaylord Palms in Orlando and it seems quieter with separate buildings versus long hallways. It wasn't musty at all and looked just like the website photos. We had a wonderful view and excellent cross ventilation. We loved the porch hammock - so relaxing. Be prepared for hard beds and air conditioning that is difficult to keep adjusted overnight. I liked having the in-room safe for our travel documents. Staff - The entertainment and front desk staff worked very hard over the holidays. My son (11) reported that the Kids Club didn't have any interesting video games. We were happy he spent more time swimming in the pool. Food \u2013 We thought the food was delicious, lots of pork, beef and fish. There were plenty of cooked vegetables but not too many fresh choices. The made-to-order breakfast omelets, sweet bananas and the ice cream were super. We loved the convenience of the buffet restaurant and friendly waiters. This was our first time at an all-inclusive resort. We usually stay at resort hotels or rent condos and cook. It made the trip much more relaxing and it was a good value. It is challenging to get a reservation for the restaurants. I wish they had a more convenient system. We ate in the Italian Restaurant on New Year\u2019s and the food was delicious but not kid-friendly. It was a fixed menu and that was it. On our last night, I had shrimp for dinner and I paid for it later on. Shows - I thought the shows over the New Year\u2019s weekend were excellent. We enjoyed the Mayan/Mexican show and the New Year's show, Boogie Nights. The MC was warm and welcoming. I danced in college productions so I loved the dancing. The open-air theater was comfortable and there were plenty of margaritas. I also liked the kids program \u2013 Janet, Sadie and Pablo(?) from Acapulco kept the kids busy before the main shows opened. Things to Do - I wouldn\u2019t miss the evening show at Xcaret. They play two riveting Mayan games and the music and history of Mexican dance is fascinating, not to mention the hawks and parrots that fly in during the show. Wonderful. We also enjoyed the Xaman-Ha Aviary about ten minutes walk from the hotel. Bring your bug spray but the birds and grounds are beautiful. The snorkeling at beautiful Xel-Ha is super; we wish we had spent a full day there. We did a combined Xel-Ha and Tulum tour. Alejandro at the hotel tours desk was really helpful. Most tours leave from Playacar Plaza Shopping Center, just a few minutes walk south of the hotel. The tours drop you back at your hotel. Another good tip is that you can get a letter from the hotel allowing you to use the Occidental Cozumel resort for the day. We considered going but didn\u2019t make it. The ferry costs about $22 U.S rt each (tickets at the hotel \u2013 for use on both ferry lines) or $10 U.S. rt at the ferry terminal (buy one way so you can get on the next ferry coming back on the return).

Seawall is still not fixed, so there is no beach access in front of Allegro, but they opened the fence and built stairs to the Viva Azteca beach. Beaches are eroded in front of several resorts: Reef Playacar, Royal Hideaway, etc. Blame the storms and the fact that the coral reefs that used to protect the beaches are mostly dead now. We did not find it difficult to step down five steps down to the Viva Azteca beach, the beach was not too crowded and there were actually very few people in the water. The sandbags that protect the beach are visible. The width of the beach changes every day. Most of the time there was enough wet sand area for children to play and build sand castles. The resort itself was quiet, obviously not at full occupancy. Good side of it: there was always plenty of empty spaces for lounging around the pool (during our previous trips we had to get up at 7 in the morning \"to reserve\" a spot for the day). We loved our room and patio, especially hammock. Switching off air conditioner and opening both windows for cross ventilation was enough to remove any possible smells.

I was very concerned seeing previous negative reviews. Unfortunately we could not change resorts due to the fact that we were travelling with 4 other families and required 5 rooms. The idea behind this trip was to spend the holidays at resort so we could skip the hassles of Christmas and spend time with family who are spread throughout the country. The trouble started at check in and degraded from there. The reception staff-useless and rude. Thay announced to us that we had no beach and could not use the facilities at the little sliver of land that they were allowed to use (also owned by Occidental-the Royal Hideaway-again we were treated like second-hand citizens). They were very unapologetic and actually created more bad feelings with their attutudes and lies (yes, promises were not kept). I am not going to go into the day-by-day accounting of grievances, but suffice it to say that this resort needs a serious revamping. I would not recommend any resort at this time in Playa Del Carmen due to the serious erosion of the beaches if that is what you are going for. The beach that we did have access to was built up on bags that were used as breakwaters-very sad to see. Stay as far away from this resort as possible! Hopefully, they will change their website and let people know the reality of the situation at this resort; it is a 2 star at best with access to a sub-standard beach that the guests are not really welcome on. We managed to have a good time at the pool and with each other, but as my father said we could have been anywhere warm with a pool, rather than one of the most beautiful places in the world-it really is a shame. The fact that the staff is somewhat untrained and the food is not good (my mother actually got to the point where she could not find anything she could eat towards the end of our stay) with a major lack of variety really proves to me that the management has no interest in revamping this resort-just taking your money. They didn't even have a special Christmas dinner-it was VERY disappointing. The rooms were very rustic and tended to smell.

The hotel manager called a meeting, and said that the pool would be fixed in 48-72 hours. I would bet it will be closer to 48-72 days. So, the Allegro stepped up and offered a free shuttle service to Mamitas beach north of town. It is a beautiful beach, but the shuttle system is inconvenient, and you aren't all-inclusive when you get to Mamitas, either. You get a voucher which entitles you to 6 beverages of your choice - beer, pop, or water - any combination adding up to 6. We did the beach shuttle twice. The first time, things ran pretty smoothly, but it started to pour when we got there, so it wasn't very busy. The second time, the shuttle got lost going to Mamitas. This time it was a beautiful day, and the beach was very crowded. Our voucher system became mass chaos, and none of the Mamitas staff seemed to know what to do. So, we made the best of it. The shuttle bus was supposed to run every half hour, which seemed odd, because it takes about a half hour to get there from the Allegro. After waiting an hour and forty minutes, we gave up and payed for a taxi back to the hotel. We informed the concierge at the Allegro on the hopes of getting reimbursed for the taxi ride, but had no such luck. It wasn't about the $5.00, it was just the principle. The gardens at the Allegro are very well kept, the staff are very, very nice (hey, Remco!) for the most part, and all in all, if Mother Nature had not prevailed, I would have given a 4 out of 5 rating. I have stayed at over 10 all-inclusive resorts in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Costa Rica, and have been on one cruise. That being said, the hotel did move it up a notch when it came to the food. Every meal we ate their was fantastic. Steaks, grilled shrimp, fresh pasta made to order, roast beef, grilled pork loin, etc. Lunch and breakfast were equally as good. You would have to be pretty picky to not find something that you liked. The bars and bartenders were also very good.

The bathroom was nasty and when you took a shower, everything got wet in the shower and toilet area. Toilet and sink did not flush and drain well. The air conditioning was either on and too cold or when it was off everything felt damp. The beds are hard as a rock, built on a concrete pedestal with and extra firm mattress on top.

We found nothing to complain about. Sure, you can find something wrong at any place you go to. And believe me we don\u2019t have low standards. I worked in the hotel industry for many years when I was younger and I don\u2019t have any association with this chain. My wife and I have a positive attitude and always look to have a good time (go with the flow). However at times she says I am very picky in restaurants and hotels. Having experience in the industry I expect good service and a smile at all times. This is what we experienced for the week at the Allegro Playacar. The service was great and the employees had a big smile at all times. I\u2019m sure the guest service training for employees is intensive and it shows. All that being said, \u201cYou do get what you pay for\u201d. We didn\u2019t pay for steak & lobster so I wasn\u2019t disappointed. What you do get is a really nice resort set in tropical gardens, great location right on the beach, good food & drinks and a lot of fun things to do for all age groups if you want to do them. WATER: There is an activities pool and a quiet pool. There\u2019s a team of people arranging activities by the pool all day; they are a lot of fun if you want to get involved. Too many activities and fun contests to mention. The beach area is small (due to Wilma) but there are both shade and sunny places to lounge at the beach. Plenty of lounge chairs around both pools. Non-motorized water sports are included. We reserved a kayak for an hour and a small catamaran sailboat for an hour another day n/p. You can rent Jet-Skis, $50 usd for a half hour, $85 usd for an hour. ROOMS: All rooms are the same size (not huge but not too small either), set in small thatched roof buildings of eight each. The buildings are not in a straight row (that\u2019s good), they are set in little clusters with walkways through grassy and tropical settings (nice feeling). We had an upper room that we liked very much. Yes you know there is a thatched roof above you but we didn\u2019t find it offensive at all. We tipped the housekeeper $2 usd each day. Always got towel art and sometimes fresh flowers were in the towel art (nice touch). Left a note for four bottles of water and got it each day. Also called the front desk for four extra pillows and they were delivered to our room in five minutes. The bed was very firm, however we both slept great. My wife said it was good because if I got up at night I didn\u2019t disturb her. We even said we might think of getting a similar bed at home. FOOD: The food at the buffet was good and somewhat varied each day. Like I said we didn\u2019t pay for steak & lobster. Breakfast; after being seated we were asked if we want coffee and/or juice and were served that. When you get up to get another plate of food the old plate was always taken from the table quickly. Fresh and different pastry was baked each day (too good). Continental breakfast started at 6 am and full American breakfast started at 7 am. We tipped between $1 to $2 usd each day. Lunch; we ate by the pool each day. There was a full hot and cold buffet set up at the snack bar hut area (varied choices each day) also dessert. The pizza bar is about 25 feet away. The pizza was OK but the Mozzarella Bread is very good. Also the BBQ grill on the other side of the pool cooked good hamburgers & hot dogs and had great french fries. Dinner; there are two a la carte restaurants at night served in the snack bar hut. A Mexican and Italian, you will need to make a reservation in the lobby for each. If you want to go to either again they will put you on a secondary list if there is an opening. The Mexican is a little better of the two, tipped $5 usd. The main buffet at night is good but a week of buffets was enough for us. There is a very nice wood and brass bar up near the buffet we went there sometimes for a before dinner cocktail and also an after dinner drink. You are also served drinks & wine at your dinner table. We tipped between $2 and $4 usd each day for dinner buffet. BARS; there plenty of bars set up all around the property. Service was always good and quick. For the pool we brought big insulated mugs from home. The bartender quickly fill them with any drink of our choice to any strength of alcohol we desired. Tipped the bartender $1 usd for each round, he always served us quickly. Theater and Disco were good. The shows were enjoyable went three times and the Disco was fun also. Playacar is a very nice area. There is a very nice shopping area less then two blocks away. We walked there a few times to make phone calls on a TelMex phone and also to shop. We rented a car for the week at the airport because we had many activities planned, all worked out well. We really enjoyed our whole vacation.

Here are a few things about the resort and the Allegro hotel which I hope you find helpful before you go (if you decide to, after reading this): The hotel itself is in very pretty grounds, which are maintained daily. Lots of plants and grass gives the resort a jungle-ish feel and this is further emphasised by the thatched Polenysian style villas. The hotel staff are constantly cleaning and maintaining the grounds so the standard of cleanliness was very high. The rooms are quite small. Ground floor rooms more so as they have a low celing. Upper floor rooms have the exposed thatched roof so seem larger, however, there is very little space as it is almost all bed. The beds are actually concrete slabs and are very hard as there is not give under the mattress. Shower room is also small and is a semi- wet room; it can become very slippery. Air con is OK but the noise it makes is quite loud, although there is also a roof fan. Food was fine but the main restaurant where breakfast, lunch and dinner is served isn't air conditioned. It can get very hot near the steam trays. There are two air-conditioned sections off of the main dining area. TIP - restaurant staff don't seat you there by default, so it seems exclusive, but will seat you there if asked. The buffet itself - breakfast was excellent with continental, English and other options including fruit, omlette and loads more, Lunch was more like a proper restaurant with a menu and table service. Dinner was varied each night; oriental, Spanish, Carribean, Italian, French, Mexican etc. Quite nice but cheap ingredients; don't expect steak or juicy prwans etc. \"A la Carte\" restarants were disappointing. There is actually only one, which alternates between Italian and Mexican. The Italian is sometimes set up outside by the pool, which is romantic on nice evenings. The Italian food was disappointing; crepes for starters and desert and only four main courses. The Lasagne was a mass of Mozerella. The mexican was much better and food very good and totally authentic; grilled cactus in your Fajitas..... rounded off with Tequila and nice service. Other food includes a Pizza bar by the pool which continually serves nice thin-crust pizza, a grill bar for burgers and hot dogs, a nacho bar with dips and cheese, a pool-side buffet and a midnight snack bar serving burgers and Nachos by the bar. There are two pools, one by the beach which is the focus of all daytime activities and one quiter pool; be aware of people reserving parasols. We found people would reserve a parasol and then move to the beach, where they would also reserve parasols. Both pools were kept pretty clean. There is a spa but it's reserved for timeshare owners. Dont' be fooled by photos of the beach in brochures. The beach is only 20 yards or so deep and most of it has gone. The sea now reaches the main pool and has exposed it's foundations. The sea can come in so far that the beach is completley covered. What is left is clean but it's a public beach; expect tat sellers and other traders. Entertainment is quite cheesy. Daytime Bingo and volleyball are routine, although there are Spanish lessons which are pretty useful. Night-time entertainment is dire. Bring something to do. There is one \"show\" between 9:30-10:30 which is normally a few dance routines with the odd magic trick. They are very good but it gets a bit boring after two weeks! Drinks are ok but limited. Corona is the only and the usual all-inlcusive cocktails such as pina colada and daquiri. There are some nice Tequilas though and it is worth asking for cocktails to be made with branded spirits i.e Smirnoff vodka instead of the horrible generic stuff. There is no mini-bar in the room and only a couple have fridges. A tip here and there is recommended; room cleaners leave more towels, more bottled water and make cute towel animals if you tip (one dollar or 10 pesos every couple of days). There is no waiter service so tipping bar staff helps speed your drinks along :-) One big watch out - the staff are CONSTANTLY trying to sell timeshare, from the moment you arrive. We eventually ignored them and they got the message. Another tip - don't pack any towels. There are plenty in the room and you get beach towels that you can swap for fresh ones when you want. Overall we had a great holiday; the area is lovely; Playacar is very safe and Cancun is only an hour away. There are loads of excursions and the people are great. Be aware of people trying to sell stuff; they can be very high pressure. Recommended for a Carribean holiday on a budget but if you are looking for a comfortable room, evening entertainment and more luxury, I would recommend looking elsewhere.", "Date": "November 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flint, north Wales", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!!\u201d", "Author": "mich22rob", "ReviewID": "UR5981646", "Content": "WHERE DO I START THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!! I WON THIS HOLIDAY THROUGH WORK AND I CANT WAIT TO GO BACK JUST A SHAME I WILL HAVE TO PAY THIS TIME!! THE ROOMS they feel so like the caribbean as soon as you go in, they are decorated in a bright yellow and orange walls makes you feel awake!!! the beds i found very comfy but then again they were a little hard but i had a great sleep every night of my stay!!! The bathroom was fine bath quiet big and plenty of room you have a glass screen for ur shower which is fine, just becarefukl getting out of shower as if floor gets wet it can be quiet slippy, but thats jjst plain coomen sense! THE RESTAURANT Plenty of choice at all times of the day, the breakfast you have toast, full english if you want, cereal, yougurts, continental, omlettes, and of course the strange things like vegatables and a few things u would usually see at ur evening meal!! i read on here somewhere that the sausages tasted like mcdonalds and OMG they were soooo right, they were wellll nice. dinner time yu could either eat in the main buffet restaurant or there is a buffet snack bar down by the pool which i found very very nice. also you have the pizzeria by the pool aswell, this just made things easier u never had to to and get changed to eat u could stay in your swim wear, and stay in the sun for longer!!!! THE POOLS There are 2 pools here, you have the relaxing pool, which is huge what i liked about this pool is that the steps to get in the pool were massive aswell, so u could just lie on the top steps all day to keep you cool and sunbathe at the same time which was great!!! i think alot of people got the same idea as me here though as it is so hot here!! There is also the activities pool which i realy enjoyed as there is always something going onlike water volley ball, aqua aerobics, step arobics stretching, spanish lessons, so even if you didnt want to get involved yourself you find yourself enjoying watching other people taking part. i especially enjoyed watching the reps do this dance after the aqua aerobics infront of the activities centre. anyone who has seen this will know what i mean!! lol THE BEACH What can i say about this it was paradise, white sands clear blue waters was just heaven. Water sports going on all day, there are a few included but for the motorised watersports you just ned to go to the barracuda centre which is by the pool area. THE HOTEL ITSELF very well maintained, always being cleaned constanty. the staff here are soooo friendley, they really cannot do enough for you, they become your friends during your stay and are genuinly sad when you leave, Dont be suprised to see the a few iguanas walking around on the grass, they are wild but are completly harmless they are more scared of you. u will see hundreds of tiny lizards but again these are harmless, was quite worried when i first seen them but after a few days i staarted toi think they were quiet cute as some of them are no bigger than your little finger!! room was cleaned daily with fresh towels each day and also everyday there was a different towel design on our bed. DRINKS my boyfriend only drinks beer and they had Corona on draft which he lived on all week, i made my way through the cocktail menu as they have so many to choose from, i can higly recomend the miami vice which was a a strawberry daikarey mixed with a pina colada (excuse my spellin) and again they have all you spirits also. i think i have covered everything here i will defo be returning here soon it was just amazing, i wasnt expecting it to be this nice and it was just heaven, so what ever else you read ignore any bad reviews as the people who wrote them must be deluded or just generally very picky. i hope this helps, if u wanna ask me nethin, drop me an email michelle1roberts@aol.com", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santiago", "Title": "\u201cloved the beach\u201d", "Author": "paus", "ReviewID": "UR5829287", "Content": "I am from chile and loved all in playa del carmen.. its beautiful.

THE HOTEL AND GROUNDS From the minute we stepped into the lobby and could see the beginning of the grounds we were amazed. The gardens look beautiful and are well kept and maintained. The polynesian houses are brilliant, I would rather stay in one of these any day than a high rise hotel. The whole place just looked ideal, so much nicer than you're regular hotel. ROOMS We had a room as close to sea view as you can get without having a timeshare. It was really peaceful and it was as if the whole place was there just for you, you couldn't even hear anyone else. We had a ground floor room and it was lovely, can't fault it. Not sure what people have complained about the beds for, didn't find them hard or uncomfortable in the slightest. The bed was also huge, me and my partner seemed to end up sleeping a mile away from each other we had that much space! The shower was fine too, people complaining about the shower spraying obviously don't have any real problems, the floor got a little bit wet, I mean a little bit wet, and if it hadn't been mentioned before it wouldn't be anything I'd even mention as it was not an issue at all. It had a walk in wardrobe with plenty of room for mine and my boyfriends clothes etc. The downpoint to the room was that there was only one plug socket. For all you ladies, my hair straighteners heated up fine so no worry bout that. However our psp and ipod wouldn't charge I don't know if that is to do with the voltage? My camera battery charged fine as did our mobile phones. The maids cleaned every day and left fresh towels. Our maid was a little too eager and even if we left the do not disturb sign up he would come banging waking us up early in the morning and if we ignored him he would come back ten mins later doing it again until we answered the door....when my boyfriend opened the door and tried to tell him we were sleeping and could he come back tomorrow he just stood there smiling going \"Si si!\" and smiling waiting to come in and clean, in the end we had to get up and let him clean...this was a tad annoying but not a major issue. Also we only had one swan made out of a towel the whole holiday but we saw in someone elses room he had done two swans, rose petals etc etc. Tipping didn't seem to help in the swan matter either! Again not a big issue though lol......Also someone wrote in their review something like \"imagine my horror when there was no news channel in my bedroom, how could i possibly enjoy my holiday\" or words to that effect - um this wouldn't ruin my holiday at all HOWEVER there is news channels on the TV (just to put your minds at rest!)... POOLS There are two pools, the activity pool and the relaxation pool. The activity pool was fun to be around, it had music playing most of the day, everything from UB40 to Pussycat Dolls....there was water volleyball/polo/tequila darts/beer drinking competition/kayak racing etc etc....you can get as involved or as uninvolved as you like....This is also where the swim up bar was which was lovely. You can stay in the pool till 11pm if you like so you can stay in and drink all night if you wish. It doesn't get cool even at evening so you wouldn't be cold. This is the pool that goes right out to the sea and the view is spectacular. It's great having the sea right there when you're swimming or sunbathing. The other pool was quiet and a decent size, this was great for the days you just wanted to relax. BEACH Now I don't know where the rumours of no beach has come from, maybe at one point thats how it was but certainly not now. The beach is a great size and has enough sunbeds for all without it ever seeming over crowded. The sand is white and soft and the sea is turquoise. No seawead or grotty bits just clear blue water....It's paradise...There are sunbeds under thatched parasols and ones in the sun. Also inbetween the hotel and the beach is another layer of sunbeds on a raised level with sand flooring and hoods (think pram hoods) over them to give shade to your head and shoulders...we found these a godsend after getting burnt! There is also watersports available from the beach including Jet Skis. The Jet Skis are i think about \u00a315 for 30 mins which is quite good value. We were told its impossible to fall off them unless you do something really extreme because of the way they're designed. We however managed to fall off :-S We were fine but lost our sunglasses! Make sure you wear the wrist strap however as this stops the jet ski if you fall off. THE DRINKS The cocktails were great, sometimes strong, sometimes not so. The beer they served was Corona on draft. My boyfriend liked this but was convinced it was watered down and he couldn't get drunk on it. They had a huge selection of spirits including some brands like Bacardi, Smirnoff etc. The big let down was the soft drinks...they were branded (Pepsi) but were all completlely flat and horrible throughout the hol....the pineapple and orange juice were nice though. THE FOOD The food in the buffet resteraunt was good. They had plenty of selection, most nights me and my boyfriend would end up with completely different things from each other as there was so much selection. One word of warning though - aviod the chicken - it's very pink and very bloody everytime it was there. I never ate the chicken but however I have been very ill since I got home, I can't say whether it's been food poisoning or a virus but just be careful you choose food that is well cooked. Everything other than the chicken seemed fine. There was a great selection of food and it was all gorgeous. The breakfasts were great too and the sausage and hash browns were very like Mc Donalds which I thinks great. There was also things like waffles/pancakes for breakfast and fruit or cereal. Also I think they had smoothies and omlettes. They also had some strange things like lasagne out at breakfast, and cauliflower and carrot. People seemed to be eating them too! The food at the pool bar was mainly poor but they did have a nice potatoe salad there one day and some nice meatballs. The potatoes were usually cooked well too which is something I'm very picky about. They also had a nachos thing with cheese sauce, gaucamole, salsa etc at the pool bar which was nice. The pizza place was fine, nothing special nothing bad. The Mexican resteraunt was lovely but we loved the food at the buffet so much that we only visited the resteraunt once. LOCATION Playacar is gorgeous, it feels very safe and posh and for the first few days it was hard to believe there was a world outside of it. It only costs about \u00a32.50 maximum to get into Playa Del Carmen by taxi which are always about outside the hotel so this is very easy. Playa Del Carmen is nice, posher than most tourist places I've been but with all the usual touristy tat....Nothing much worth buying, we bought ourselves some photo frames. NIGHTLIFE The 'club' at the hotel had loud music playing but was dead at all times, however the one pool table was always occupied. In Playa Del Carmen the best place to go was The Blue Parrot. It had one dancefloor inside that consisted of sand this played proper dancy type music. You could also dance on the speakers here. The seats at the bar were swings which seems to be the local gimik. We still loved it though. Outside, on the beach was a wooden dance floor and here they played mainly RnB and Hip Hop which I loved and although my boyfriend isn't a fan of that sort of music we managed to have one of the best nights of our life here. The drinks are stronger than the hotel and the beer you can get is Corona or Sol. A round consisting of a beer and cocktail came to around $5. Brilliant place to go highly recommended. There is also a Senor Frogs which is fine but not lively like the one in Cancun. Deseo is the place with the beds on the rooftop and it was a great place to start off the evening, really classy and chilled out. For amazing nightlife head for Cancun, a taxi will cost about \u00a325 each way but you can get transportation via trips like the Disco Rolling Tour, or the Coco Bongos tour etc. We visted Cancun twice, once on the Disco Rolling Tour and once on the Coco Bongos one. The disco rolling tour was well organized with a guide who is very friendly and fun who looks after you all night and gets all your drinks for you. He supplied us with plenty he was never far away. You visit Congos which is supposedly a bar but it's very crazy and a lot of fun, then Senor Frogs which is slightly madder and then Coco Bongos which is the peak of the night. You spend 1 hour in Congos and then 2 hours in each of the other two places. The trip to Coco Bongos on it's own was brilliant. We had someone pick only us up, no other people, take us into Coco Bongos and then return to pick just us up all for \u00a330 each. This was with drinks included all night. Coco Bongos is the most amazing experience you should check out the website it's really a must do on your holiday. We loved Cancun night life so much we will return there next year for our whole holiday. It is very much a young crazy place though. EXCURSIONS We did the two trips menitoned above. We also did a pirate ship tour which was probably the worst trip we booked but was still ok. The show was very funny, the pirates are great and really had us laughing. The letdown being you had a pirate assigned to however many people to bring you your free drinks, other pirates got there people loads but we got two drinks and then didn't see our pirate again and it was impossible to get drunk. There was a bit too much forced interaction, trying to dance with absolutely no space and being forced to get up and pull people you didn't know up onto the floor and rub noses with them etc.....ok if you like that sort of thing but even if you don't you HAVE to join in. Bear in mind you may well be sober too! The thing that topped it off for my boyfriend was a forced game of someone coming round collecting everyones shoes, so they took our shoes and then we were forced to go and eat while the game was still going on and we had to walk around bare foot. My boyfriend finally got his brand new trainers back completely soaked in beer so the evening went downhill for us from here. Also you are on a boat so you are completely trapped there for the duration whether you enjoy it or not. Onto a good trip was the Dolphin Swim. We did this at Dolphin Discovery which is about 15 mins from the hotel. It's around \u00a380 each for the Royal Swim which is the best package. You have around an hour in the pool with the dolphins, you get to do a dolphin kiss, touch the dolphins, hold the dolphin like a baby, swim out and put your arms out and the dolphins come behind you and you hold there fins and they pull you along. You then do another one where you lie flat and the dolphins come behind you and push there noses into your feet so you fly out of the water. It's very fast and exciting and brilliant experience. They take lots of photos which you can purchase for around \u00a37 each. We purchased just the one. The DVD is a brilliant memory and is a bit steep at \u00a325 for a 5 min or so dvd but its well worth it to capture that memory. Downside of trip you dont get picked up till about two hours after you've finished your swim, I presume to try to make you spend money at the bars/resteraunts... Another great trip we did was XelHa. I never thought I'd fancy it before we went but it turned out to be one of the best trips we did. It's a full day trip and I think it cost about \u00a340 all inclusive each. You get to snorkel in a huge lagoon (its very cold so be warned!), free hire of snorkel, flippers, rubber rings (double or single) etc... You can jump from the cliff of courage (we did this) and I have to say its not really that high. It's about 4m. It hurt me a bit when I landed but only momentarily and I was glad I did it. If you do this trip I'd recomend buyin a waterproof camera to capture the day. We did this but have yet to have it developed. It was about \u00a313 but you couldn't take your normal camera around with you as you're in and out of water so much. There is a cycling bit which we did just to get somewhere quicker but it was suprisingly fun. The bikes had no breaks which made it slightly more scary and fun they really went fast! There was also a hammock area for relaxing which was as close to paradise as you can get. We booked only one trip through our tour operator and the rest through Gray Line. If you turn out of your hotel and go left there is a small shopping area in Playacar, they had a stand outside here and were brilliant and 100% reliable. On a downside, we booked to go Coco Bongos through a tour place in Playa Del Carmen. We paid $14 deposit and the tour never turned up. We were not so much annoyed about the money it's only \u00a37 but that it wasted a night we'd been looking forward too. This tour company was on the left hand side as you walk down and was a tiny little place, just near a tree with a seat around it. Avoid at all costs. When we went down to complain it was shut but if it's open again do not go here. I don't know if I've included everything! No doubt I've missed something but the top and bottom of it is go!! Ignore the bad reviews, some people must be impossible to please, this is the nicest place in the world! You will love every minute!!

Overall the vacation was nice. Playa del Carmen is a beautiful place with great beaches and many other forms of entertaining (snorkling, sight seeing, eating and partying). What follows is a brief breakdown of the hotel and playa del Carmen The Good: The hotel staff was great; everybody always had a smile and were quick to please. We have absolutely no complaints regarding service. The hotel is cute and is always very clean. There are two pools, so people have the option to lounge at one or participate in activities in another. The sea is simply beautiful with shades of aqua and deep blue. The Mexican restaurant is very good, but you need reservations. The town of Playa is great is more upscale than cancun, so don't be surprise if you run into a star or just some really gorgeous people. The Bad: The food was not really that great. We have stayed at other Allegro/Occidental resorts in the past and the food has been much better. We found that the best meal of the day was breakfast. The Italian restaurant is just some tables and chairs by one of the pools; no reservations required, but there is always a wait. There is no public transportation in this part of town, so if you want to go to Playa you have to take a taxi($5 flat rate each way) If you are very athletic, you can walk into town. The despicable: The guest. These people were so rude, it actually made us uncomfortable. We were told by the hotel staff that many of the guest that were staying there at this time of the year are Europeans, particularly Spaniards. I am of Spanish descent and I had never had to deal with such an unfriendly bunch. No good morning, thank you, sorry, excuse me, nothing!!!! It got very tense after a while. Neutral: Yes, the beds are firm, but I slept like a baby. Yes, the beach is narrow, but there are plenty of chairs and shady areas. the beach was eroded due to the huracanes last year. The rooms are small...very small. The showers do not have curtains, a design oops, but some towels on the floor resolved the water problem. The first room we were in had some condensation and musty smell, we asked to be transferred and the next day were in a new room. Most of the rooms do not have ocean view; ask for rooms in the 50's and you will be closer to the beach and might get partial ocean view. Hope all this information is helpful and hope you have a great time at Playa del Carmen.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cNot the greatest experience\u201d", "Author": "angel1989", "ReviewID": "UR5600257", "Content": "We stayed at the Allegro in May '06, and I was very disappointed in the room, as the tile floors just didn't feel clean, and my AC could not be adjusted, so it was either off or freezing us out of the room.

I went with my family; Mom, Dad, Me, Sister. All of the posts are mostly true but if you are an easy going person you will enjoy yourself. The people and service were great! They loved to make conversation, help, and entertain. A few of the waiters never stopped making us laugh with their Mexican laughs, howls, and asking you if you wanted tequila in every drink you ordered. We did not think the beds were hard or uncomfortable but the lack of a shower curtain took some practice! Tipping the maids, bartenders, waiters, and drivers is a good idea, they really appreciate it and they remember who tips! Although the beach is small, it is nice, plus you have the 2 pools. There are water sports, suh as sailing, kyaking, windsurfing, jet skiing, parasailing, snorkeling, scuba diving and a few more. The sailing, Kyaking, and windsurfing are free but lessons and the others are not. I reccomend going to xel-ha. It is beautiful and reasonable- $95 per person- all inclusive- snorkling equipment, locker, towel, food, drinks, Bikes, yours, cliff jumping, rope swing, etc. It's a must see. Also right down the road is a shopping mall where ou can buy clothes, jewelery, handmade goods, cigars. Also around 9:00 people come to the resort who paint pictures, and sell most of what I mentioned. My father and I went fishing and caught a big barracuda (54\") and some snapper, they kind of pushed us over by not going back to where we caught the big fish but it was fun. The food was very good but if you eat at the buffet every day it gets old. And finally, The shows at 9:30 are entertaining and hilarious.

Positives: The majority of the staff were nice. The activities staff are wonderful, they should be given a raise. The nightly show with the dancers was Fantastic with a different theme every night, very talented dancers. Two nights there were no dancers (Thursday and Sunday) and they did a Mr. and Ms. Allegro night instead with audience participation. These would be two nights to miss the show and head into town or do something else. The maids did what you asked when you left them a note and a tip such as extra water bottles. The grounds were beautiful. The water was beautiful. Beach was small but adequate. Plenty of chairs at beach and pools...Safe worked great, never had anything stolen. There was a restaurant/hotel in Playa on 5th avenue by the name of Don Emilone that had great fajitas and reasonable prices/good service, great iced tea. At the resort, fresh fruit and breakfasts were good. Mexican restaurant o.k. Acitivites by the pool were lots of fun. They offered water aerobics and regular aerobics every day we were there, and for a full 45 minutes...I recommend this. Lots of water volleyball. There was a line at times at the pool bar, but it went very fast, maybe you had to wait 2 minutes max? Snorkel trip for $33. per person from the resort called Barracuda was good. Husband and two kids did Parasailing on the beach for $120 for all 3. Swimming with Dolphins was great at Xcaret, for one full hour. We booked this online in advance because they book up, don't count on doing it if you wait until you go to the park. They do have a 20 minute dolphin program if you sign up that day, but the people didn't get near the interaction with the dolphins. also, if you sign up online with Xcaret, the dolphin program costs $102, vs. $125 if you wait until you are there to sign up. There is a snorkeling inlet at Xcaret that was good, lots of fish. BUT, if you are really interested in just Snorkeling, go to Xel Ha instead, snorkeling is MUCH better there, we went 3 years ago. The plaza that is a 3 minute (not 5) walk to the left of the Allegro entrance was nice, but RX there was overpriced. I found the best prices on pottery there at a shop where everything is ALREADY priced. If you try and buy stuff in Playa, nothing is priced and you usually don't get good deals unless you know what something should sell for... I walked to Playa one day for excercise and it was a nice, hot, safe walk. You walk into Playa on 10th avenue. On the way, there were two very interesting stops at some Maya Ruins. These ruins are everywhere, and if you are into history, you will like this. I price drugs at several local RX's and found the best prices at the first RX you come to when walking into Playa, it's on the right side, next to some other stores, up about 5 steps. Stock up on antibiotics while you are there... Negatives: We were given the room farthest from the beach possible, next to the front entrance to resort where we heard several drunks over a period of a week's time coming to their rooms at all hours, waking us up. After the first night, they did offer us another room closer to the beach, but it was on the second floor, which we couldn't due because of physical limitations of a family member. So, in all honesty, they did try to relocate us, but we had to stay put. Also, on the last day, we spoke to a couple who got an oceanfront room because they payed an extra $20 a day more, they negotiated upon check-in when they arrived. The drinks were VERY weak, however, when we asked for a margarita made with Juervo Gold, they gave it to us with a smile and it was strong... The food was just o.k., we didn't care for the nightly buffet at all, but honestly, there was so much food, you could always find something that you liked. The ice cream was good for dessert, all other deserts will disappoint you, they are soggy creations ordered in from the outside I believe...in honesty, I think Americans are accostomed to really sweet desserts, in Mexico they are not very sweet... We never received clean washcloths, had to call for those and toilet paper twice, but they were really quick in responding to our needs... The last day at checkout was a total turn off for me. The front desk clerk said I owed $1 (one dollar) for an internet charge. I had used the internet twice and paid cash both times...I told her I paid this, and she told me I had to produce my receipt or pay again. I told her I didn't keep $1. receipts but from a principle standpoint, I refused to pay the $1. again and asked for manager. I was just so amazed they would argue about a $1. She actually called a manager over a $1.!!!! When he appeared, he looked at the clerk as if she were crazy and told her to credit my bill...So, I guess you should keep all receipts relating to the hotel in case they try and charge you again. Espcially if you spend a lot of time on the internet and have a large bill... We have stayed at a 5 and 1/2 star resort in the area before (Bahia Principie) and I can tell you there is a big difference in that and the Allegro, but I will have to say that the entertainment and pool activities exceeded the Bahia's, but those two things were it, with the rooms/food/service at the Bahia being much better.

Don't listen to those complaining, this is a great value for the price. If you want 1st class/5-star then pay for it and stay somewhere else, that's all. Here are some positives: caring, friendly staff throughout, fun activities if you want, free snorkle equipment, Hobie catamarans, nice, clean rooms in good repair, manicured lawns and gardens, no elevators, short walk to everything, good security, no rules, no loud rednecks, great nightly shows in theater, Kids Club, great pools, convenient to Playa del Carmen's 5th Ave shopping area. Yes, the beds are hard but we slept like babies everynight (no, we weren't drunk, either!) Beach is smaller than in the resort\"s web pics but you can walk as far as you want in either direction, water was perfect temp, too. Allegro has two pools divided by the bar and buffet building. One pool has music and activities guided by the staff (Hey Adan!) and the other is the relaxation pool. Food was great and plentiful but after 5 days you will probably be ready for your native food again. Dining room looks like it is a 4 star resort. Note: don't be cheap, tip a little money to the service staff. The maids, bartenders, wait staff work hard for you and a little tip will get you prompt service and extra bottled waters and towels in the rooms. We received fresh flowers on our pillows everyday which was very special. The resort is located in a gated area of 24 other resorts and vacation homes and is very secure. We took our nine year old daughter and felt very comfortable leaving her with the Kids Club or roaming around the pool area on her own. Our daughter met other kids from around the world, made friends and had a blast. We met several families with kids and we would all watch each others children if the parents wanted to go off to do something. The nightly show begins with the Kid's Club staff, Janet and Sadie' leading the kids in danced onstage in the theater. There is some European sunbathing (that means \"topless\" for you country bumpkins) but it was mostly on the beach and only a few by the pool. If bare boobies offend you, then look away, I guess. This resort is for families and kids so I you want beer-bonging and Girls Gone Wild then check out Cancun hotels. For a great dining experience in town, try \"Aqua\". Very nice. If you desrie something very local to do, then try going to a Luche Libre wrestling show (see \"Nacho Libre\" in theaters now) in Playa del Carmen. They hold it every Sunday evening at 7:30 in the public basketball court only a block from the main drag where they convert it into a mini arena. It is the craziest show with the crowd consisting of drunk Mexican guys, families still dressed from church, little kids selling cold drinks and of course, the Luchedores, who dress in the wild masks and outfits. $5 bucks a person. Leave the area as soon as the show is over because the park area is not the safest at night in spite of it being next to the Police Station.

We asked for extra bottled water at the front desk and by the time we arrived at our room, it was on the front step. We carried a strap of singles ($50.00) with us and tipped 1-2 dollars each meal and left the same for the maid on a daily basis. The grounds are immaculate, as are the pools and the beach. Every bungalow has a porch or balcony with table and chairs and a hammock. Yes, the beds are rock hard and the drinks are a little weak, but if you ask for double shots, the bartenders cheerfully oblige. By the second or third day they will juice you up without being asked. The food is typical resort buffet stuff - always chicken and some type of fish, as well as pasta. But you can find shrimp, sushi, and duck, too. Each night has a different theme at the buffet. The Mexican requires reservations. The food there is excellent. If you don't want to listen to a 2 hour time share pitch, just say \"NO\" anytime someone mentions \"free gift\". If you don't mind the trade off, you can get a $40 voucher for your trouble. If you are looking for luxury, the Occidental owns the Royal Hideaway next door. It is a 5 DIAMOND resort and will only set you back about $500 per night, per couple. We paid $65 per person, per night at the Allegro. For that price, we didn't expect Egyptian cotton sheets or lobster. Prices are outrageous at the hotel and the little market close by. I paid $6.00 plus change for a box of Band Aids. Bring your own sun screen and burn ointment. Anything imported from the USA is unbelievably expensive. We saw Pringles for $5.50 a can. Take a can of Lysol or air freshener, as this is the Caribbean and the high humidity leaves a musty smell. There are internet cafes in Playa Del Carmen (a 20 minute walk or $5.00 cab ride) that only charge $2.00 per hour. At the hotel, it's 25 cents per MINUTE. We paid $40 per person for parasailing (booked thru the hotel). Hair braiding (full head of long hair) should not cost more than $30.00.

We were given the honeymoon treatment, which includes one breakfast in bed (breakfast to your room) and a lovely flower arrangement. We were not bothered at all by pesky sales people, just friendly staff who always greeted us with an \"hola\" or \"buenos dias.\" The pools were great, the activity staff was very outgoing and personable, but not pushy. The evening shows were great, we were really impressed by the dancers! Food and drink were available at all times practically -- there are actually two kinds of beer there (not just one like someone had written in their review). You just have to ask -- they have Corona regular and dark. We didn't figure it out until our 5th day so it's not advertised! Although the water is not bottled at the bar by the pool when you ask for one, it comes from a water cooler with purified jugs of water. All the food was pretty good, the pizza and burgers were below average. The buffet foods were great, every night. The pool snack area had a great variety and all the food was fresh (except I saw the guacamole came from pre-made plastic tubs). The Mexican restaurant was pretty authentic (I'm Mexican American) and the meals there were great. The Italian trattoria was set up alongside the relaxation pool and I felt like I was at an outdoor cafe. The food there was delicious!

Plus, the fire alarm outside our window kept going off (just an accident or malfunction). Not to worry, the next day they moved us to a different room. Still very simple but so much nicer. Everything worked except the ac kept breaking. That's ok - we like it hot and only sleep there at night. The room was charming in it's simplicity and decor. The maids do a wonderful job.

We stayed on a second floor villa and like one of the reviews mentioned, we had an unanticipated third roommate for most of the trip....a gecko! It came in thru the tiki-hut roof and hung out in the corner of the roof most of the time--- It really didn't bother us--it was so small...and gave us something to laugh about.

The grounds of this hotel are absolutely beautiful---so many flowers and gardens--- Everyday you would see staff doing some type of landscaping---they really take pride in their work. As for the beach, although it is not the Largest--it is still certainly beautiful. Besides, it's too hot to lie on the beach all day, without taking a dip in the sparkling blue/green ocean--which was amazing. We took advantage of the free boogie board rental and found ourselves lying on the boards in the ocean for 2-3 hours a day. The food was plentiful and good--again, not a gourmet feast--but tasty----We enjoyed the french toast and omlette station at the breakfast buffet, nachos and pizza bar during the day, and the Mexican Themed restaurant for dinner.

(photo attached) - Lack of Variety on Menus Buffet did not supply the stated Cuisine...for example...since when did pasta, refried beans, and pumpkin cream soup be classed as 'Oriental'. Choice of approx four dishes in both the Mexican and La Trattoria...Pizza was ok during the day, as were the burgers. - Poor Service at Pool bar - Poor Service at main outside bar - Terrible Music both poolside and at 'Fast Eddies' Songs repeated two and three times in a row at poolside (after the cd jumped for the umpteenth time). The Banging Hard House music in the 'club' area was not quite fitting for any single person there...in my opinion...(as a DJ) - Still working on the wall at the beach Obviously unfortunate due to the hurricanes, but quite unsightly all the same (photos attached) - Nightime Entertainment Despite the fact that the Entertainment Staff worked incredibly hard, the shows and MCs were pretty much replicas of the previous night...variety never hurt anyone. Although it was a tough crowd at times! - Occidental Allegro 'Reps' I appreciate its their job to sell...but the two guys that approached us were verging on creepy/sleazy...a nd I don't appreciate BS. At the risk of sounding 'snobby', I would say that this hotel is no more than a 2 Star accomodation....3 at a very severe push. I wouldn't say don't go, but just be open minded about what you are or are not going to be getting.

The rooms are not huge, but ok for us - no dressers for clothes though but some shelves and hangers. No refrigerators for keeping water cool, but we were provided with plenty of water. Use it to brush your teeth, we did have a sickness bout for a few days. We ate yogurt at breakfast and it helped to feel better (wish we had done it sooner). Stayed at the pool most of the time as there was not very much room on the beach with shade - very hot there. Did not have alot of trouble finding places with shade at the pool. Hamburgs, hotdogs, buffet food available at the pool most of the day. Activities at the pool every day which were alot of fun. Also can paint some ceramics if you get bored. They come out beautiful after Victor touches them up for you. Never worried about our things being stolen or had any problems. Food was good with a different theme night at the buffet (Asian, Spanish, Mexican, Carribean, Italian, International). Breakfast had a great variety as well (never ate there or lunch as ate at the pool). Did not eat a ton since it is so hot there you tend to get full very easy but you will not starve. We ate at the Mexican restaurant (try the bean/bacon soup!) which was good and ate at the Italian restaurant (along side of pool) but was not that pleased with my meal there. Chicken & accompanies were cold but my boyfriend's was good - beef tenderloins. You do have to make reservations for the Mexican restaruant and I did hear you only can eat there one time per week but I am not sure if that is true. Shows every night and after the shows, not much to do but go to the \"disco\" after which is basically a room with a bar and a pool table. We met some really nice people from England and spent some time here with them (Hi Wendy & Mark), but it is definately not a \"disco\" by any means. Go in to Playa Del Carmen at least once to 5th Avenue - $5 cab ride. Be warned though, you will get asked by every vendor about booking trips with them, etc. - just say \"all set\" or \"going home tomorrow\" and they will let you be. Also was asked EVERY day at the hotel to get a \"free gift\", etc. etc. which is the timeshare deal but just told them EVERY day, we're all set. They are persistant however. If you are in to snorkelling, please book the \"Mayan Adventure\" snorkelling tour. They take you to three sites (ocean, cave & cenotes) and I saw the most variety of fish (& stingray) that I ever saw on any snorkelling trip I've been on. Tour guides were wonderful and always took great care to make sure everybody was all right and the food they provided was very good. If you are booked at this hotel, don't worry -- you will have fun.

Turn the handle clockwise for hot water, counter clockwise for cold water. 2. Yes, cheese and cold cuts are a breakfast food (beans too) 3. Ice waters-down soft drinks, so in the lands of no refills, very little ice is put into drinks. If you want ice in your soft drink, go to the bar. 4. Women take their bikini tops off to tan. Men wear skimpy suits by the pool and the beach (Walk passed the RIU north of the resort for an eye-full). Oh, and feel free to change clothes in public. 5. Plan on eating at one of the other restaurants on Mexican Night. 6. 100 Pesos does NOT equal 1 dollar, nor do 10 Euros/British Pounds 7. Penicillin, Viagra, Cialis, Rentin-A, Phentermine, et. al. are over the counter 8. If you leave your (very rude and racist) child(ren) unattended, he/she/they will be disciplined by me and others. 9.

My husband and I bought into the timeshares during our last visit there. We got the usual \"90 minute\" tour which lasted for 1/2 day( they always manage to eat at least one meal with you). They showed us what all was available to us with the purchase of the time share. We were showed the Vacation Club rooms, Club House, Hot tub, and top shelf liquor that was ours as well as a bar stocked with our favorite top shelf beverages. After we paid in full the dues, we are now told that our plan no longer exists. We are entitled only to a room near the front entrance. But, we could \"upgrade\" for around $7000 and receive the plan we initially bought. There is a statement on the contract which says they do not have to honor anything you were told verbally in the tour by any of their employees. That's the catch, because basically our thousands of dollars bought us absolutely nothing. We spent a great deal of our vacation listening to excuses about why they could not honor our contract. In summary, they added new levels (more money) to the plans and ours was pushed downward. We will not return to this resort although we love it due to the time share scam. If you want a cheap time share plan, approach an existing member and they will be more than happy to sell you their plan. There were several members there that we talked to that was so very unhappy with the time share plan that they said they will not return to this resort.", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "sheffield england", "Title": "\u201cnever again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5020741", "Content": "me and my husband and two children stoped at this hotel may 05, never again the rooms were a disgrace we moved rooms 3 times.

Three days before we were supposed to leave, our hotel was changed from the El Mandarin to Allegro Playacar. Our travel agent said it was a $600 upgrade but we will never know since we never saw the El Mandarin. (Their pool was being rebuilt--construction from 9a.m.-7p.m.) I loved the layout of the Allegro...very tropical, two pools, and activities. There are some annoying, loud black birds that squak in the night and early morning that do annoy, but it's the tropics! The rooms are okay...tile floors, odd showers without a door, not alot of light. But who spends that much time inside anyway?! They always replenish you daily with purified water bottels...more if you leave a small tip ($1), and left towel sculptures of a frog/swans on bed. Nice touch. The buffets get repetitive, and I have a food allergy so I couldn't try everything, but very nice presentation...They have both natural air/air conditioned areas to eat in. We went snorkelling with Barracuda water sports on premise which was a rip-off, a big disappointment! We saw maybe three different types of fish and that was it. Promised a lot more! Sea turtles, sting rays, etc....Mayan Ruins/Jungle were never seen. Pedro promised us alot and let us down for $33 a person. Plus, there was bloody gauze on the boat floor which was unsettling! The worst part was the \"Membership Program\" that we were tricked into being part of. They ask you if you want to save 40-50% the next time you come...which we said \"yes\" to. Then, an Allegro Playacar rep comes to breakfast with you and 2 hours later they try to sell you a $10,000 membership for 100 years worth of vacations. Yet, when they start the speech they say they are not here to sell you anything or take account numbers from you! Thomas was nice, then there is a numbers guy who gives you all the mathematics of beng a \"Member,\" then there is Alfredo---who totally pushed us and made us feel like real lowlifes for saying \"No!\" to all their \"Membership\" deals. It went from $10,000 to $7,000 to $2499 to $750 until you finally say \"No Deal!\" That was horrible, since they totally misconstrue the whole breakfast \"chat.\" Alfredo dismissed us like we owed him something for his time!!! That is the main reason I will not return to Allegro Playacar. I loved the scenery and the tropical sights...we may return again to another hotel. It is worth your money and I do reccommed this hotel, but beware of the few things mentioned!!!!

However, the hotel did leave a bit to be desired. First, the current aerial photos of the hotel's beach are deceptive as there isn't a lovely 40-50' beach at the end of the main pool. There is a very narrow 20-30' beach with many people crowded into the few beach chairs. As with the pool, people come early and lay 'claim' to a beach, or pool chair, for the day - even if they're not using the chair. This means that many people have to do without a chair or squeeze into the sand. The kids club is really for very young children as the kiddie pool is a wading pool and the activities are designed for toddlers and kids under 8. My daughter spent one day in the kiddie club but was bored. The two attendants were quite pleasant but didn't take the kids out of the single room except to toss toys in/out of the wading pool. The buffet is quite extensive and offers many choices. Most items were tasty but not 'gourment'. The Mexican theme restaurant was quite good with some local dishes. The need for reservations seemed a bit odd as the times we ate at the restaurant the tables were not fully occupied. The outside (by the second pool) Italian rest. was nice also, especially if the weather is pleasant as the tables are in the open. The main lobby/office staff is quite friendly but not particulary helpful. Ex, The Internet access room was rarely open and most of the tiem the PCs were not working. If you want to check email, send mail to family, check flight times, etc. you were better off going into town to find a Internet cafe. You also had to pay for the use of the PCs and with the PCs dropping connection it was costly. The nearest pay phones are in a small shopping plaza, about 5 min. walk. I'd suggest purchasing a phone card at the plaza pharmacy as the pharmacy sells cards that work in the plaza phones. The 'town' is a working town and is a nice break from the hotel scene. It's a 20-25 min. walk (depending on if you're older or have kids) and passes by some local Mayan ruins. Take the ruin walk as it goes near a beach with nice, small hotels, condos and leads into the town. The ATM/banks in town dispense in pesos and the exchange rate was 11.50 pesos/US dollar vs the 10.00 pesos/US dollar at the hotel. The brochure we had said that the non-motorized water sports were 'unlimited'... well, unlimited is 1 hour per day per sport (ex., 1 hour of wind surfer, 1 hour of kayak, etc.) even if the sport equipment sat their unused. I wanted to take the Hobie Wave out for a couple hours (I sail in Colorado) but was told that 1 hour/day was the limit. Keep in mind that the area around the Occi Allegro is filled with other large mega-resort hotels, vacation homes, condos, etc. There is also the never ending stream of timeshare sales reps. If you walk down the beach, in any direction, you'll find thousands of tourists. The only quiet beach is South, about 1 mile and past the resorts. It was full of trash so we did some clean-up but the area needs a bulldozer to keep the refuse from blowing back into the ocean. Looks like a local Boy Scout or Rotary project is needed. The local travel agent, MLT Vacations/WorryFree, rep. was unfriendly and useless when it came to selling us tours. We eventually purchased Xel-Ha/Tulum and Coba (EXCELLENT) tours through another travel company. You can get better tour deals in town through the tour operators. *We really enjoyed the Coba tour though it was a long day of driving/stopping at other resorts to pickup tourists/and HOT. Our tour company also stopped at a Mayan village to hand out school supplies and pick up trash collected by the kids, swim in a underground cave/cenote (refreshing), and lunch next to a lake with alligarors. A good tour but lots of walking on uneven ground - bring sturdy walking shoes/socks, as well as TEVAS for swimming the cenote and a swim suit/towel. Tips: bring at least SPF40 as the sun is intense, bring a large brimmed hat/visor, bring a 1/2 sleeve or long swim shirt (Speedo) for yourself and the kids, bring a mesh bag for wet clothes/towels and to get rid of sand from the beach, plastic beach toys, wind breaker for cool evenings, leave your jewelry at home, travel pouch/waist pouch for passports, money, credit cards, Gatorade powder for long days away from the hotel, small first aid kit/bandaids. If we take the Coba tour again we'll fill a suitcase with school supplies, small metal toys, etc. for the Mayan kids. Bring at least 2 cameras - my digital camera stopped working and I'm glad I had a disposable/water proof camera as a backup. It took decent photos and we didn't mind taking it to the beach, snorkeling, parasailing, etc.", "Date": "April 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cAmazing \u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4996306", "Content": "the hotel was amazing we got there right after they renovated from the hurricance.

We had a fabulous time! The resort was charming. We loved the Polynesian-style huts with thatched roofs and balconies. Each room came equipped with a string hammock. Our room, with two double beds, was not spacious, but it was certainly adequate. We barely spent any time there, except to change, shower and sleep. The air conditioner worked very well, and there was also a ceiling fan. There was an electric room safe for valuables and passports. The beds were a bit hard, but the comfy pool lounges more than made up for that. There were two pools, the activity pool (with a swim up bar), which always had something going on, and the relaxation pool. Even though we were there during Spring Break, we never had any trouble getting lounge chairs under a palapa. I understand that the beach was devastated by last seasons hurricanes, but the sand was soft, and the water was shallow pretty far out, which was great for the kids. The food was plentiful and delicious. My daughter was fairly picky, and wouldn't try any of the more exotic foods, but there were plenty of breads and cut fruit to satisfy her. If you have a particularly finicky child, you might to do well to bring along some peanut butter. Breakfasts were great, with pancakes, french toast, eggs, breakfast meats, and omelets made to order. The snack bar by the pool was available from approximately 11-4, and there were always nachos, burgers, pizza, and salads, in addition to other dishes. The drinks really are all included, and available all day long. The tourism scene was a little chaotic, with various agents trying to sell you excursions. Ask guests who have been there for a few days where they went and what they paid. We went to paradise beach to snorkel for a half day, and had a great time. We also did the full day Chichen Itza trip. I think if I were to do it again, I'd go to Tulum instead, as it is much closer. Chichen Itza was a three hour bus ride each way, but the trip also included lunch, a show, a couple stops (including a water hole swim and a church). The mini-town of Playacar is a 5 minute walk away, and there are several souvenir shops (don't forget to bargain). The best kept secret is the aviary, which is a 15 minute walk (or $5 cab ride) down the road to the right. It's open from 9-5, and costs $15 for an adult, and is free for kids under 12. (there's also a kid's price, for children over 12, but I don't remember what it is). Every night there was a mini-disco for the kids at 8:30 and a show at 9:30. If you don't like staying up late, I recommend requesting a room away from the stage. Our room (a premium room) was close to the pools and beach, which worked well for us. The only complaint I had was that the internet was down most of the week. However, I found that you can use the internet at neighboring hotels, if necessary.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "sarahq19", "ReviewID": "UR4985623", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at this resort from the 18th to the 25th of march and had a blast!

We had read all the reviews and were a little apprehensive. All I can say is either we were easy to please or all the complainers of this hotel are too fussy. We chose this hotel for the value and that's what we got. I'll try to address the main concerns people raised about the Allegro. Rooms The rooms were small, but always very clean. (Maybe this was due to the daily $2 tip we left for the maid?) The shower stall was unique. No door or curtain was present, instead about 20 inches of glass extending from the wall which did a very poor job of keeping water off the floor of the bathroom. Other than this annoyance, the room was great. Plenty of hot water and the a/c was always working. Our room had a small safe that worked flawlessly. We had no problem with bugs and didn't observe any of the spraying for insects that many people had complained of. We both slept like babies on the supposed \"hard\" beds. Construction/noise We too were woken by birds in the morning, but come on, you're on vacation, is this really a big deal? Would you rather the hotel staff shoot the birds? The theater and some of the units were still under construction, but we never heard any of it while we were there. It was hot while we were there (85-90) so we had the windows closed and the a/c on for most of the days, but a couple of times we had the windows open and still didn't hear any pounding. Our room was on the ground level, so perhaps that helped as well. It sounds as if the upper level rooms are less sound-proof due to the thatched roofs. Additionally, our building was two units in from the ocean and two units away from the pool, a perfect location in our view since we were far enough from the pool to not hear all the activities, but close to the ocean. Food/drinks The food at the buffet was ok. The breakfast was by far the best meal of the day. Additionally, the snack bar by the pool was good. As was the pizza available by the pool during the day. The drinks were plenty strong. Again, tip your bartender a couple bucks the first time you see him and you'll be fine. I would also recommend bringing an insulated mug to use for drinks. We enjoyed walks down the beach and this came in very handy. Beach Speaking of the beach, it is smaller than the neighboring hotels, but it is big enough. We had no problems finding chairs under or near the palapas. If you're concerned about this, place a towel on the chair in the morning before breakfast. There are some rocks in the ocean. We found this in front of the Allegro and other hotels. We didn't wear beach socks, but you may want to consider this. If you're careful, you'll be ok. Timeshares The staff in general is very good. However, we quickly figured out that anymone who offers to show you around or meet you for breakfast is going to try and sell you a timeshare. Just politely decline and you'll be fine. We heard other guests complain about being stuck listening to sales pitches for a couple of hours. The only person you need to spend some time with is your contact for setting up your return ride to the airport. Be warned, this ride will leave 4 hours before your scheduled flight's departure time. There you have it. To sum it up, we had a great time at a modest hotel in a great location. I may go back, or I may try another hotel further south down the beach.

We started out with a terrible flight. We flew a charter flight on Funjet. Got to the airport and many people there waiting for the next person to \"scam\". Terribly busy airport esp on Thurs and Sun., so keep that in mind. So, we get to the hotel....more people waiting to \"scam\" you for excursions, which by the way, are cheaper if you buy them in town. We were taken to our room via concierge. It was a rude awakening upon entering. Musty,damp smell and mold can be seen in the ceiling tiles. Very dirty floors. The shower has NO shower curtain so every time a shower is taken, there is a river of water to clean up from the shower to the bed. The worst part of the room for us was the mosquito infestation that it had. I had to literally try and kill all of them for an hour before bed to keep from getting bit during the night when the sheets slipped off. We spent several dollars on repelent and mosquito coils, but that didn't help anything. I came home with about 30 bites esp behind my ears and on my ankles. We did tell the desk, but nothing got done about it until the day we were to leave. As we were walking out of our room, there was a nice man walking up to our door with a sprayer. 5 days later!!! Had complained at least 3 times during the week, and to no avail, nothing was done. It didn't help either that the maid kept the door propped open during the day to clean, allowing anything insect wise to enter as it pleased. We also had NO electricity or hot water during some of the days of our stay. That means NO air conditioning in the heat of the day in an already musty, moldy, swamp-like room. Imagine it! Also the bed is perched as a mattress on a concrete slap. It was honestly a lot like sleeping on a rock hard floor. Awful! The TV had 2 channels available in the English language which were E and Cartoon Network. Pathetic! I was sooo disgusted by this. Felt completely tuned out from the world with absolutley NO news channels. Also there was NO beach to use. If you wanted to go to the beach, you had to walk over rocks to go walk to the nicer beaches down the way. The ocean in front of the resort was also NOT swimable as there are rocks that cut your feet upon entering the water. Another disappointment was that the hotel will not let it's patrons have the water equipment at times ie: windsurfers, boogey boards, catamaran. All things that were supposed to be part of the all-inclusive package. What a crock! Couldn't even really give an explanation why---- other than if the water was a little rough that you could get hurt. Funny the other resorts down the way let their patrons have all those things! Was VERY frustrating NOT to have more to choose from restaurant wise. The 2 offered are a mexican cantina (which the food and service were good) or the other was an Italian style set up right next to the pool. It was very chilly at night and windy, so if you want to brave that, you can.....it's a set up outside....not restaurant style. I thought it was a poor choice to have people sitting outdoors during the evening hours. Both restaurants, however, are set up that way. The few good things that I can say are these. I was never served anything without a smile. All the workers were especially cordial and did the best they could to be of service (aside from the front desk staff). I was impressed as well with the amount of work done by the maid services. They are very hard workers and did the best they could with what they had. My overall review of this hotel is that it was a pathetic excuse for even opening. I do NOT feel that the renovation needed, after the hurricane wiped it out, is adequate. It should NOT be open until the mold problems and the lack beachfront are irradicated. It was very frustrating having NO electricity due to the workers needing it to be turned off. Not to mention the incessant pounding and nailing and sawing in the middle of the night was also ridiculous and completely rude. People are there to be on vacation, not to be awakened at 3 am by construction. Good luck to anyone staying at this hotel! It was a joke from start to finish. I would NEVER stay here again. I'm sooo utterly disappointed at the amount of money we spent on the whole trip for all of it to be ruined by the lack of accomodations.

Drinks were fine but I'm not a big drinker to be fair. Web site boasts in room safe, I use these for my passport and credit cards, it was broken and gutted.

The grounds are beautuful and maitained well, but no beach at all anymore. there were many beautiful hotels on the same street, go to any of them. The Mayan ruins all down the street were facinating and I would love to go back..to a different hotel. The bathtub was stained, filthy, and broken, as was the shower head until late in the week. No shower door so be ready to wipe up all the water off the floor, which by the way, was always dirty. The pools were very nice, but good luck finding a chair to sit in. My favorite, I like to chain and bolt my door when I sleep at night, the trim on the door was broken and a gentle push lifted the trim away and the bolt was useless.

BE CAREFUL AT THE AIRPORT FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO SELL YOU TIME SHARES, ASK YOUR TRAVEL AGENT WHO TALK TO AT THE AIRPORT. YOU MAY STOP AT A COUPLE OF HOTELS BEFORE REACHING YOUR HOTEL. HOTEL:The Hotel is Mediterranian looking. Actually a pretty nice set up. It was devastated from the Hurricane and Was shut from 6 Months and Re-opened on January 15, 2006. Part of the hotel by the beach was Destroyed. ROOMS:Check in time is at 3pm. We got in our room at 3:15pm. We go to the hotel at 2pm and went and looked around and had some lunch while we waited for our room to be ready. Our room was fairly clean. We had 4 People (2 Adults, 2 Kids-aged 5 & 7), and the room was pretty small. If you had only 2 people, it wouldn\u2019t be that bad, but we had trouble finding a place to put our Luggage. The Beds: They were Terrible! Hard as a Rock. I would suggest you have the hotel staff bring a fluffier Mattress (I saw a few of them being brought to other rooms). Every Room has a deck with 2 chairs, table, and a Hammock, which is nice for lounging. SERVICE: We found the Employees to be very nice. They kidded around with our kids and always had a smile on. MEALS:The Hotel, again, was devasteded and the restruant was being Re-done. In the meantime, we ate on the Tennis courts. The meals were to good to very good. I didn\u2019t have any problems with the food At all. We ate Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner there, but you could also eat at the restaurant at the Pool, which was good as well. And they had thin crust pizza in the afternoon that was outstanding. DRINKS:My wife and I drink only occasionally and we found the drinks to be very good and we got them quickly. But you don\u2019t get a lot of alcohol in them, so I would suggest you ask for \u201cdoubles\u201d. They are free. ACTIVITIES: The second day there, we went parasailing and snorkeling. Both were a lot of fun. Might I suggest you trying to \u201cTalk Down\u201d the price. They are like Street vendors, they want your business, so give it a shot. We went shopping at \u201c5th street\u201d, where you can buy all of your souveniers. Taxi is $5.00, but ask first to make sure. You can also walk to a small, but nice, shopping center across the street to the left. BEACH:Not much beach left. The water is beautiful, but there are huge rocks left for the part of the hotel that fell into the water. I actually cut my foot as I was getting off the boat that took us Snorkeling. I would recommend wearing the \u201cWater Socks or Beach Shoes\u201d in the water. POOLS:The pools are very nice, right on the water. They have 2 pools. Both are for Adults, one is for Kids. There is a nice \u201cSwim up Bar\u201d. There is a lot of activities such as pool volleyball, Yoga, Dancing Classes, you can learn how to speak Spanish as well. We didn\u2019t need to get up at the crack of dawn to get a Pool or beach chair, we did in Aruba and hated that. (The line was huge and you literally waited for over and hour just to get a chair in Aruba) OVERVIEW: It\u2019s not a 5-Star Hotel, probably a 3-star, but for the money if was pretty nice. If you want to pay more money, I would suggest the RUI, there are 2 RUI Properties on Playa Del Carmen. Both look Very nice. We walked through to get a look and the beach and pools are huge. One bad thing: The hotel staff was always pushing the Time Shares and their other properties, this after My wife and I told them we would think about it and if we wanted to talk to them more, we would contact them, but they kept pushing it every day.", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas tx", "Title": "\u201cno beach\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4617604", "Content": "there is no beach at the allegro. and when you do go in the water watch out for the rocks. there is about 8 yards of rocks under water that you have to walk over. saw alot of people get hurt. the staff was wonderful. rooms just ok. we didnt have any trouble but heard of numerous people with no hot water or no water at all. we lost power for awhile but called them and it was fixed within 30 minutes. had to ask for reprosado when ordering tequila or they would serve some crap tequila. i will say we were dissapointed with the accomadations when we first arrived however we did have a good time. just know what you're in for with the beach(meaning theres not one) and so on. stay liqured up and you will think you had a good time regardless.", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4603580", "Content": "This was our 6th time visiting this Allegro chain of resorts. After two devestating hurricanes the resort is making a come back but without the wonderful beach it once had. Some construction is still underway but compared to other resorts they are further along than most. Service and aminities are above what you'll find along the strip and the quality is above average (food, accomodations,). Many people we spoke to during our tour of the beach daily from other resorts complained of being sick and having the lack of bottled water available to them. The food seems to be the same at other resorts with theme nights and common everyday dishes prepared morning, noon, and night. Thus far Allergro is better as we had top shelf liquors (Bacardi, Beefeaters, etc), other neighboring resorts had (Arrow, Appleton lines of cheap booze)and some with ..no ice. If your looking for a nice place to beat the weather back home and to not worry about carring a wallet around this is your place. Pool is maintained and is in superior condition. Nice thing was......NO SPRING BREAKERS! to pee in and foul the pool water and puke every ten feet. Considered a family resort this is a great place to kick back and relax while your chidren are off playing and learning about another culture. If we had one complaint it would be that Cancun airport stole our luggage (from a direct flight) which we never recieved after 7 days. Allegro took us to Wal-Mart to get the thing we needed to get by with and help us in everyway......try that someplace else! Suggestions if you are going to this or any of the Allegro resorts: Take a large insulated cup to hold your drinks and ice. The bartenders will fill them up and let you place the amount of liquor in them...\"say when\". Always request a safe for your money and important belongings. Do not pack a bag to be checked by the airlines! They are stealing the luggage in large numbers! Take two carry-ons and pack to a minimum! Tip your housekeepers a buck a day and ask for more bottled water....you'll get it. Bartenders will take a $1.00 bill a long way if you are a tipper. Finally.......Be polite! and avoid the Europeans as anti Americanism is rampid and don't stare at those bodies in speedos!......EECK!

I have to give the hotel and staff 2 thumbs up. Prior to leaving and reading all the reviews I tryed to changing my hotel but didn't suceed and I am glad. Upon arrival and using Worry Free Vacations (which I would also recommend booking through) they are just that \"Worry Free\". The hotel was correct about the hotel rebuilding they were very up front on the information. I knew when I booked the hotel what the rating was and have no problem with it, if you really know what the rating means. I thought the staff was wonderful we barely got checked in and 3 differnet employees approached us and showed us around. The bartenders were fun and friendly and so were the restaurant staff. It basically comes down to if you treat them with respect they will do the same to you. The rooms were ok nothing fancy but clean you can, however, hear your neighbor next door the reason being you have a grass roof which doesn't keep much noise out, and the showers were a bit interesting with just a half piece of glass for a shower door so the floor gets wet. The beach is ok, there isn't much and actually allot of the beach was getting washed back out to sea while we were there. The resort also need more lounge chairs on the beach and in the pool area's, it was kinda annoying when there all these chairs but no one on them except someones towel. The thing I really enjoyed was having a hammock on our deck, it was wonderful to lay in it listening to the ocean. The food was just ok, I have had better at all inclusives but I am not a picky eater. The grounds were very nice and kept up. The bottom line is if you have a Champagne taste with a beer budget this is not the place for you, but if you have a beer taste and a beer budget then you will like the resort and have fun. One thing I just have to say is how I noticed how rude and messy some of the tourist were, I was disturb at the amount of garbage people just threw around and expecting someone else to just clean up their mess, I can see why some of these employees get a tad upset and aren't kind to the customer. These employees work hard and long hours for pennies on the dollar they work 7 days week doing there regular jobs during the day and then allot of them also do the shows at night. So if they have a crabby day here or there I guess I can't blame them if they are putting up with rude tourist.

The temporary restaurant schedule was confusing and limited because they weren't all repaired. Lots of minor glitches were blamed on not being ready yet. I can't count the times I was told \"It will be fixed next week.\" Downright Weird: A manager found us around the middle of the week and said the general manager wanted to give us a special dinner to make up for the problems. Did we want steak of lobster at the restaurant tonight? We said it wasn't necessary, but he insisted and so we said lobster would be nice. At dinner that night no one said anything and it wasn't on the menu. Nobody said another word about it, including the manager. We didn't want the lobster in the first place - we just wanted air conditioning - so we never said anything either. But it added insult to injury so to speak. They shouldn't tease guests like that.

The first day I just wanted to sit and cry. After I adjusted we were able to enjoy our vacation. We went diving on cozumel which was wonderful. We drove to the Mayan ruins and loved them (except for the smelly car). We really enjoyed Xcaret. (It was cheaper to take a taxi and buy our own tickets than to book through the hotel) All in all it was a good mediocre vacation, just not what you wanted to spend 8 grand on (over 10 grand by the time we took all the tours and tipped, tipped, tipped). PS. for all of you that think I am just picky, please understand that I have spent weeks at a time in Tjuana doing service for the local people, sleeping with my whole family on cots in one room of a run down community center. I don't mind roughing it...just not at this kind of price!

I had stayed at the Allegro a year earlier and really loved it. Was very surprised at the beach erosion. Not much space to walk around people sunbathing and no room for volleyball at all. But the hotel acted like the hurricane was not big deal right up until the last day, which was extremely troubling as we were dependent on them to keep us safe. We arrived on Thursday and they acted like it was silly to be concerned and they received storms all the time and most hurricanes would veer off at the last minute despite reports on CNN in our room that it was heading straight for us. They first told us that we would each be in our rooms or if we were in a 2nd story room with the thatched roofs then we would be moved down to the 1st level. A little frightening when news reports said it could flood 6 miles inland with storm surge. Finally by Saturday, we received news that we would go to a shelter. It wasn't until Sunday morning that we had a briefing that we would be moved to the Royal Hideaway theatre next door and the families with children would stay at the Allegro. I will skip the stories of the hurricane itself... After the hurricane, we came back to the hotel and it was pretty demolished. The lobby roof fell completely in, all of the windows of the main building blew out including their main dining rooms and Italian restaurant. The inside of the upstairs looked mangled and there was pretty bad water damage. The theatre at Allegro was demolished as the whole roof and structure collapsed. The pools were dirty but easily cleaned up. The restaurant by the pool that is open air had minor damage but this is now the only place to feed people. Most of the rooms were ok, some with flooding, some with roofs damaged, some windows blown out closest to the beach. Beach erosion looked minimal as there wasn't much room there anyway after Ivan. The worst part was the loss of so many trees.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shrewsbury", "Title": "\u201cUpgrade shows\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3677912", "Content": "We have been to Playa many times and will go again. The Occidental Allegro Playacar hotel had a substantial upgrade about a year ago. Their efforts show and the staff seemed to be pleased with the improvements. A happy staff makes happy guests. A very good hotel. All the hotel in Playa have their own character. We first stayed at Club Maya, a smaller hotel, food was not very good, but it has a crazy, fun Italian/Mexican feel to the place. We then went to the Riu ClubHotel next door which is more formal and Spanish, very good food, but it is so large it is a long walk to the beach, a large number of Europeans (including a number of 200+ pound topless German vixens). Our third was our favorite which is the Iberostar Tucan. They used great architecture to have the two parts of the hotel surround a lovely garden jungle so the walk to the beach was fun. But everyone is different and a vacation is more than a hotel, so we will likely go back to the Occidental Allegro hotel on Cozumel.

We really needed it to refresh after a long trip in. Then the front desk clerk told us that we were unable to get connecting rooms as we requested per our reservation and was told that they would accomadate us on the next day, which they did. But, for the first night my kids were adjacent to us without a connecting door. No help for the first day. We had to wait about 2 and half hours before our rooms were ready for check in a 3pm. So we ate at the buffet and waited. The rooms were smaller than I expected. The entire building is concrete, including the headboard, which makes for a safety concern for young kids standing on the beds and falling. The shower does have a half wall with no door, which allows the water to spray onto the floor. The plus is that the shower head is detachable and can be used to direct the water away from the opening. The beds are firm, yet did not bother me or my family at all. The a.c. works too good and will freeze you overnight even at the lowest settting. We usually turned it off in the early morning and coasted with the cold air in the morning til we left. The rooms do come with safe, which you have to check out a lock and key with a $100 fine if you lose the key. A $50 fine is also charged if you lose any of the beach towel keys that you are assigned to. Something else to worry about on your vacation. The resort grounds were very nicely landscaped with tennis courts, basketball and volley ball courts throughout. Plenty of shady areas throughout your walk to your 4-plex Palapa style housing with an outside patio and hammock and table and chairs greeting you upon your entrance to your door. An occassional Iguana could be spotted on the grounds along with plenty of butterflies and a wierd looking animal that looked part rabbit and part pig running throughout the grounds. The guests were a mix of many different countries which I was suprised of how many people were from overseas. It makes for nice conversation with the guests. The pools are very nice and clean with food and drink bars surrounding the pool along with planned activities at the front louder pool and a second relaxation pool for the tranquil sunbathers and swimmers. The drinks were good, yet all the beer was all beer poured onto a small glass. I would have preferred the bucket of beers and sit by the beach for a few hours, but that was extra. You would have to walk up the bar each time you wanted a drink, which was aways from the beach front. Hard to get a buzz that way. The buffet was great at first and was downgraded to o.k. after the 4th day of eating basically the same thing everyday. I got an allergic reaction the the pasta served with SHELLFISH and red sauce. I was itching all over until I took Benadryl and it subsided after about an hour. It must have been bad or something because it has only happened to me once before in my entire life. The service is good. The breakfast was great with omellette made to order. The variety is good for all visitors worldwide. The lunch & dinner buffet had burger, pasta, pizza, mexican cuisine, italian cuisine, luncheon meats, fresh fruits, vegatables, etc. The Italian restaurant was the BEST! With five course elegant dining from appetizer, salad, soup, entree, dessert. All excellent! Service was great and the kids also got the star treatment. You must wear pants and no flip flops according to the dress code, yet my wife and kids got in with sandals and nice spaghetti strap tops. You must make a reservation upon arrival to secure your limited seating. We missed out on the Mexican restaurant, so no advice there other than make a reservation as well and casual attire is allowed. The entire lobby, restaurant and hotel entertanment is without air conditioning! Just Palapa tops with air flowing through. So be prepared to cool off in your room as needed. The only other air condition areas are the gift shop and The Italian restaurant and maybe the downstairs disco, which I didn't attend. The outdoor evening shows are entertaining and helps you spend the night with the family and to have some drinks. Nothing of the Las Vegas caliber, but helps pass the evening on with audience participation throughout. The entertainment staff was fun and energetic. The kids also got to dance on the stage for about an hour before the show with the staff. The kids loved it. On the courtyard around the stage is a makeshift market with some artwork, jewery, soveniers, pictures with you and your family with a donkey for sale. The beach front offers free non motorized sports as needed. Along with excursion for scuba, snorkeling, fishing, etc. all at your doorstep for a fee. The beach front is narrow only about 20 feet and gets deep rather fast for younger kids. We preferred the Playa de Carmen beachfront for the kids and drinks under a rented table and umbrella. Oh yea, topless women do come by here and there so prepare yourself and family..... wear shades. The hotel has its own travel excursion department which can assist you on any travels you may desire with ground transport available at your doorstep. The taxi to Playa de Carmen shopping and beach is 46 pesos, ie. $4.60 usd. I highly recommend Xcaret as a full day excursion at $85 an adult and 42.50 per child over 3. The hotel also offers currency exchange at the front desk as needed. Internet access is also offered at a price and International calls to the U.S. are at $5.00 a Minute! Bottled Water is given to you at your room daily. We would tip our housekeeper 1 or 2 bucks and we would get an extra liter of bottled water. At check out we requested a late check out, but was denied. But we were offered a Hospitality room for 30 minutes for a quick shower before our departure. To our dissappointment the room had not been clean prior to our arrival. So we rushed to get the housekeeper as time was ticking down before our departure. Overall, I would stay at Alegro again if it was the only package deal available at that time and the price was right. But, if had a choice to venture off and try another resort for basically the same price I would venture off.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cBugs in the Bed!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3638371", "Content": "We knew, from reading the reviews, that this was not a five star hotel. But, we were still very disappointed. The staff was not very welcoming upon arrival. The first room we were taken to smelled so horrible that we requested another one. Unfortunately, this room did not have much of a roof. The buildings have thatched roofs and they don't bother to finish out the rooms. So, the only thing between you and the rain, bugs, animals, etc. is that thatched roof if you are on the second floor. The first night I found several black bugs in the bed and my husband and myself figured that they were falling from the ceiling of the room. The birds wake-up at 6:00 in the morning and so do you, because you can hear everything. We wanted to relax so we had to come back to the room to nap during the day when the birds weren't so loud. Air-conditioning in the rooms barely worked. There are no doors on the showers, so water leaks all over the floor and runs out into the room if you are taking a long shower. The beds are very hard and the only thing good about the buffet is the breakfast. I didn't find the staff the be very friendly and they couldn't seem to bring soap to the room even after we called a second time. The beach has been washed away by a storm, so it can get pretty crowded when everyone tries to find a spot in what beach is left.

Lets start at check in. We reserved the \"Superior\" deluxe room with either a pool or ocean view 2 months ahead of time. We recieved confirmation of our reservations. We arrived on June 25th 2005 to the hotel and were promptly told that we did not have the room we reserved, all the superior pool and ocean view rooms were full. When I showed them my confirmation and complained, their response was..Oh well. Also we reserved a smoking room with 2 beds (my wife and I both smoke), and we needed the extra bed for my 10 year old daughter. The room they put us in was non smoking with one bed. (Beds there are hard as rocks I should add). Also we arrived at 1 pm and were told that we could not get into our room til 3:30 pm. So there we sat..in the heat..in long pants and shirts for 2 and a half hours. By the 3rd day..after hours of arguing about our room with management they Finally gave us the room we were supposed to get. I dont know how this hotel got a 4 star rating..but trust me...in the states in would be rated 1 star...maybe. Did I mention NO room service? No fridge in the room..and only half a door on the showers? and also..NO dressers or anywhere to put your clothes..exept a small shelf. Now, on to the restaurants and the food. There are only 3 restaurants in the whole place...a buffet restaurant (no air conditioning), 2 specialty restaurants, one Mexican, One Italian. Only the Italian restaurant is air conditioned. Now here is the surprise they dont tell you til you are there..you can only eat in the specialty restaurants ONE time per week..and you must make reservations. The food....to say the food was bad is an understatement..I have never had such bad food..and there was very little variety..its the same food all the time..what you see on Mon..you will see again on Tues..and Wed..and Thurs...Also make sure you have plenty of snacks in your room..because there are a lot of times that none of the restaurants are serving food....so you can get very hungry if you dont keep a supply of snacks. The Bars...there are 4 bars at this hotel..again..no air conditioning. Now in your room you will have a welcome book telling you the hours of operation of the bars and restaurants. You can pretty much disregard whatever they say in that book...the bar that is supposed to stay open til 11 pm will close anytime they feel like it..usually around 9 pm (this was the only bar close to my room) So now you walk all the way up to the lobby area to get to the other 3 bars. The first is an outside little tiny walk up bar which is supposed to be open til 12 am. Again..it will close when it feels like it..9 pm..10 pm..whenever. Next to the inside bar by the buffet...this bar is usually open til 1 am..but its sweltering..no air. Which leaves their DISCO. Never has the word disco been so inappropriately used. Its a room about the size of an average home living room..with a big pool table in it and a juke box. Although it usually will stay open til 1 or 2 am. The beach....WHAT BEACH?? Its virtually non existent! You walk down the steps...take 5 steps and you are in the water. If you are going to Mexico to enjoy the beach...this is NOT the hotel for you. The pools...2 pools....both shallow. One is a relaxation pool....the other is an activity pool. Not much to say about the pools..they were clean..the water in them was hot..but again..they are supposed to be open til 1 am..and again..they closed when they felt like it. Room service..Forget it..they dont have it..and no little fridge in your room either. Cleaning Staff...They were very good...they kept the room clean and the towels stocked. Helpfulness of the staff.....with the exception of one or two good people...the rest of the staff was VERY unhelpful..and most of them do NOT speak English. If you call the front desk to ask for something...like the roll away bed I requested..you will get it..EVENTUALLY. I asked for it at 3 pm..I got it at 10 pm. Also there seems to be some problem with the key cards they give you and the locks on the rooms..Every single day I had to walk all the way up to the lobby and get new keys because my keys would stop working EVERY day.....their explanation was....well they had none..they just did nothing about it...and acted as if it was no big deal. Overall impression....this is a terrible hotel. For the price you can get a much nicer place in the same area. If I were rating it I'd give it 1 star..and thats stretching it. I've stayed in nicer places along a highway for about 80 dollars a night. Do yourself a favour...look elsewhere. I'd suggest XPU HA Palace.

When we came back after lunch, the man who took care of us was a bit rude and uncaring. I found the rooms to be depressing. Not enough light (artifical) in the rooms. Realizing you are here on vacation, but I would at least like to be able to see what I am doing when the drapes are drawn. The beds are ROCK HARD. I am a back sleeper and don't mind a firm bed, but I couldn't sleep on my back because the bed was so HARD and UNCOMFORTABLE. The rooms have a unique odor to them. Couldn't quite figure out if it was the cleaning products or what. It rained the last day we were there and the roof leaked. The food got to be tiresome after the first few days, breakfast was the best meal of the day. I ate at the snack bar one afternoon and two hours later I was sick. When I reported this to the management I was told it could not possibly been the food. However, the morning we left I went to have their \"continental breakfast\" and found fruit flies all over the uncovered fruit and sweet rolls. Needless to say I did not eat. I will however commend the restuarant manager for allowing me to see the doctor at the hotels expense. The food in the Italian Restuarant was rather salty. I was unable to eat at the Mexican Restuarant because of illness. When I went down to the beach to get towels, I was asked where were my towel cards. I didn't get them at check-in. When I went to the front desk to ask for my cards, the desk clerk acted as if though I was lying about receipt of the cards. It is true the beach is not that big but that wasn't such a big issue for me. We found chairs to lay out in and were able to soak in the sun. Also, if you plan on departing before 7:00 a.m. from the hotel do not look to have breakfast before you leave. They do not serve before that time and will not bring anything to your room either.

First, the food is not spectacular and I would say the buffet is probably your best bet if you are with your family. Second, the beach is narrow but not crowded. We were able to get lounge chairs every day that we went to the beach and usually with a couple under the thatch umbrellas. Third, the beds are firm but not hard and are comfortable enough to get a good nights sleep. These seem to be the biggest complaints that I have read in these forums so I hope this helps. We did some extra activities and you definitely want to look around for the best deals. For example, 4 of my group (and only us 4) went snorkelling and paid $30 USD each for 2 hours. The agent at the hotel wanted $33 USD for 1 hour in a group of 10! Trust me and see Carlos Lopez when you hit the beach and tell him Jerry from Illinois sent you. He was excellent for us and produced on the spot with no waiting like the agents at the hotel. We didn't do any of the ground trips but I can tell you to buy your tickets to any of the parks online and pay a cab to take you there. It is much cheaper that way.

For lunch we usually were in our swimsuits around that time so we just ate around the pool area. they have a pizza bar, which i thoroughly enjoyed. they also have someone grilling burgers. I went with my family of 5, so we had two rooms. i know everyone complains about the beds, but i might be the first to say that i LIKED the firmness of them. soft beds really hurt my back, so these beds were perfect! i had no trouble sleeping at night--if anyting, i felt like the pillows were a little on the high side. another thing that annoyed me about the room, was that there was a musty smell in my room, but not my parents. Also, the showers were annoying, in that they only had half of a shower door, so the water would spray out onto the floor if you stood a certain way in the shower. the maids did an awesome job, and i left them $1 a day. i think they appreciated it a lot, as they left 2 bottles of bottled water and made gorgeous sculptures out of towels on the bed. i stayed in a room with my brother and sister and i believe we had one of the best rooms on the property. it was rooms 5801 and 5802, and they were literally RIGHT next ot the beach and the pools. there was no noise at night, like i read from some of the reviews. my mom \"complained\" of the loud ocean waves the first night but changed her mind and enjoyed them the 2nd night after she was used to them. we loved the hammocks hanging outside each room. the way this resort is set up is very practical. each little hut consists of 4 rooms on the bottom, 4 rooms on top. it is very convenient to go back to your room. there isn't a hotel lobby to walk through, or a long ride down an elevator. you just walk outside your room, and you're at the beach or the pool. it is great! another thing that is great are the resort grounds. they are absolutely BEAUTIFUL and are some of the prettiest gardens i've ever seen. there are people maintaining them day and night and really a site. i felt very safe at this hotel and everyone is just SO friendly. there are nightly shows that i really recommend. the show differs from day to day, but there are basically 2 kinds. one kind is the \"audience\" invovled kinds, where it is completely based from the crowd. another type of show was the dancers and performers. i enjoyed both of them. the dancers/performers are extremely talented, one girl especially. look out for \"tonya\" --she is absolutely gorgeous and one of the most talented dancers i've ever seen! (i included 2 pictures) i saw men walking up to the stage and only taking pictures of her. she might make it big one day, so catch her there for a treat! the \"audience\" based show were hilarious! most people laughed until tears almost came out. they do have sexual references, but the little ones usually don't pick up on them. another thing to note: there are many vactaioning europeans there, so you WILL see breasts on the beach and near the pool of all shapes and sizes. some firm, some big, some saggy, some small. just don't stare too hard. most come with their husbands, lol. last but not least, the beach: it is not as bad as some of the previous pictures have shown. i guess the sandbagging they're doing is paying off. there are 1 row of chairs next to the water...it didn't bother me that much because the swimming pool is RIGHT next to it. if you want to lay out there are PLENTY of chairs, maybe we went at a time where it was less crowded because you could find a lounge chair at any time of the day. waking up at 6am to reserve one was not necessary! the water is crystal clear and just gorgeous....... Another thing to keep in mind: if you want to take trips such as x-caret, xel-ha, etc, do NOT book them with the travel agency at the resort! they jack up the prices with no bargaining power. if you go to the shopping plaza literally a 2 minute walk to the left coming out of the resort, there is an agency there where you can get the trips cheaper than at the resort: it really adds up, esp. when you buy for more than 1 person! you can bargain with them as well. you'll have a great time here. i wish i could go back! with my boyfriend this time though! ;-)", "Date": "June 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London UK", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to return\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3530183", "Content": "My best friend and I have just returned from a fabulous week at the Allegro.

The food was better and more varied in the buffet than I expected and the service was always excellent. We were however very unimpressed with the food and service in the Italian restaurant. The nightly shows were ok but there could have been a bit more variation and there's not a lot to do on site after that (although you can go to Fast Eddy's for a few). Playa Del Carmen is only a 5 minute taxi ride though and there's plenty of bars to chose from if you don't want to go to bed too early.

The people were great & very friendly. We didn't have any problems to speak of, although, the only bad thing we can say, is agreeing with another review I read. & that is the beach. We were VERY disappointed about losing our beach! We at first figured, we never had seen it before, so it won't make much difference to us how it looks now? Until you see the pictures of how is \"used\" to be, then we were very disappointed! The beach was pretty much gone. Lots of sand bagging all week. It was hard to walk into the water on rough days, because you would fall on the sand bags that you couldn't see under the water. On the calmer days, it wasn't so bad. It still doesn't take the beauty of the gorgeous waters away, but it was a bit frustrating, when we didn't find out from our travel agent until two weeks before we left for our vacation. & yes, as I also read in another review, the stairways were under construction because of the water coming up so high, & we were priviledged enough to actually \"witness\" one of the palm trees literally fall into the water! We thought it was halarious at the time, but kinda sad really? We didn't blame the hotel staff for the beach though, they are not responsible for the weather, they can only do what they can & they still worked hard at making it a great place to be. Regardless of the lost beach, we had a wonderful, wonderful time & would go back again! (hoepfully with much more beach???) Oh, & our rooms? They were good. Not the Marriott, no...but we loved the thatched roof \"Mexican\" style look the resort had! The beds, yes, hard, but no bed is like your own bed! We had neighbors meet us there too & they loved it as much as we did & will definately go back! The beach was our only problem.

Only 10 dollar cab ride. And the boat ride to Cozumel is fun to do. But we weren't as impressed wth the sister resort as the one here in Playacar.

My husband and I have very little to say that is negative about this resort, save three concerns (and two of these aren't directly the fault of the resort itself). The staff: are wonderful. I do not agree with comments about the overuse of English. I came to Mexico with about three Spanish words to my name and they always seemed to prefer speaking in Spanish (which is why I was able to pick it up pretty quickly)-and they never minded me asking how to say something in Spanish either. I even partook in their Spanish classes---a great idea--Andreas was a very good instructor. The staff are ALWAYS friendly, even during the March Break madness (they certainly had heaps more patience than I did). My only regret is that I wished they'd have had the legal power to pen the always boorish and drunken highschoolers off in an area that would allow the adults to enjoy the verdant, beautifully manicured gardens and lawns in blissful peace. As an aside, why are irresponsible parents allowing their underage teenagers to go to resorts in Mexico in unsupervised groups and live in a stoned and drunken haze for one week? Shame on you. The food: is good. It's not authentic Mexican cuisine (which we had hoped for) but it has variety, and is suitable for anyone who thinks a special night out is a dinner at Boston Pizza. The Italian a la carte restaurant is wonderful (remember: you are in MEXICO not Little Italy or Italy for that matter). The Mexican rest. was ho-hum. The beach: yes, it has eroded. But there are places to hunker down in and all the resorts share the length of the beach. Overheard a conversation between an engineer and a French couple about plans to fill in the beach and expand it, possibly as early as in the next year. The housekeeping: excellent. Especially love the attention to little details such as the \"origami towels\" in the shape of a rabbit, mermaid or elephant etc. A nice, personal little touch. But then, this place is close-knit in feel and is all about the little touches. It is up to you to find these simple and sweet efforts that they make. They always endeavour to please and I only wish people appreciated the staff more, especially since they work very, very long hours and earn only $5-6.00 a DAY! The rooms: love the high, thatched ceilings, and hammock and it is always clean. They provide safe, bottled water each day as well. Security: excellent. Once at midnight, when we called to complain about the rowdy, obnoxious drunken and stoned, you guessed it, teenagers housed in our block, security was swift and immediate. Never had that arise again. Front desk: as mentioned in other reviews; the staff are dealing with chaos and ignorance on an hourly basis---they have the patience of saints and earn very little for it (I'd like to see a 40+ year old North American man or woman reduced to dealing with rude and pampered 16-18 year olds, who walk around with an heir of entitlement, with as much grace and aplomb as the staff did). A special mention: ALEJANDRO is exceptionally good. He made our car rental experience a positive one and expected no tip for any of the help he gave to me. He is que bien! Now for the three concerns: 1- The car rental company in the lobby- their prices varied from hour to hour, day to day. We wouldn't recommend using them at all. And the supposedly \"safe\" American car rental companies in town aren't any better either (Hertz, for example, deserves to be overlooked since one guy gave us the runaround after promising a car and making us kill time to wait for it, only to be unapologetically told later that they didn't have one after all). However, DO check out \"Express\" car rental. When my husband and I were in dire straits and couldn't seem to rent a car from anywhere in Playa Del Carmen, we happened upon \"Express\" car rental on the Xaman-Ha road near calle 2. Miguel was professional, very accommodating and had fantastic rates. We strongly recommend this small company (He even closed his shop temporarily to drive us back to the resort!) 2-The nightly entertainment: the Mexican food and entertainment night on Monday was fantastic, especially the regional dance performance from around Mexico. The other nights...not so much. 3- As mentioned earlier, and in no way the fault of the resort, the teenagers.

We went with a group of 20 which included 6 families with children from ages 15 on up. As you know, spring break in Cancun is the big thing for 18 and up kids. We wanted to be with our kids and be away from Cancun. The Allegro was perfect and being close to Playa Del Carmen worked out great. They could take a taxi into town for the evening and go to the popular spots if they wanted, but chose for the most part to just stay at the Allegro and go to the disco since it was all inclusive. They spent most of the day by the pool enjoying each others company and met lots of kids from other states as did the parents. However, there seemed to be alot of people from Minnesota at the Allegro. Rooms - The rooms were on the smaller side, but worked out just fine. Not alot of time was spent in the rooms. The hammock outside each room was great for naps. They were kept clean daily with fresh towels. The maids made cute decorations on the beds daily out of the towels. Grounds -The grounds were maintained daily. Beautiful gardens. Food - The food was good. You could always find something you liked. Lots of fresh fruit and salads. The egg omelets that are made to order were great for breakfast. The made to order pasta for dinner was also good. Sure, there was some weird stuff, but isn't there always when you go to diffferent countries. The snack bar by the pool was good at lunch time as was the pizza. The kids loved that they served pizza at night from 11:00 to 1:00 a.m. After a week, you do get tired of it to a certain extent, but we certainly did not go hungry. Beach - The poor beach. It would have been nice for the kids to have a beach to play volleyball or something on, but nothing you can do about it. There was quite a few hotels along there that have lost alot their beach due to the hurricane or whatever happened. We made the best of it! It did not ruin our vacation. Service - We never had any problems with anybody. The staff works extremely hard. Some of them I swear never go home. They are there in the early morning and still there late at night. Our room was close to the disco and the area they do the nightly show. The noice never bothered us.

We had a really relaxing as well as fun time and ate well, too! We booked our trip ONE week before we left. We were in our room probably 10 minutes after arriving at the resort! No problems there. The rooms: small but not TOO small. They are very quaint and felt like we were living in a tree house. I admit I was taken aback at first, but I grew to love our little home-away-from-home. There are shelves you can stack your clothes on next to the hangers, my husband just lived out of his suitcase but could have put stuff in the TV cabinet which was empty. The shower was NOT a problem -- we don't splash around so much while showering. Oh, and the water was always hot. The beds were fine -- I was shocked at first when I sat down on it, but never slept so well! The birds were heavenly in the morning! They're cooing, not squawking. A very relaxing way to wake up. It felt like we were in the middle of a jungle -- a banana tree right outside our room, iguanas, some pig/rodent creatures (there are signs out, I know, explaining what they are). One lone gecko ran up our wall---inside! That was cool. It's so relaxing to sit/hammock on your deck/patio. I think they're all shaded pretty well. The buffet is \"fine\" -- some things are tasty, some sort of strange. It's actually a fun experience. They had a great pasta chef a couple of times. We only had breakfast twice but that was very good. The Italian and Mexian are superb. Great service, and you also have waiters at the buffet getting you drinks. Very friendly. The Snack Bar was nice to have. I had chips, guacamole, cheese and salsa at least once per day -- it is to die for. My husband had hamburgers and hotdogs that were very good. The bar serves up any drinks -- they DO have top shelf liquors -- and any tropical drink you want. All water is filtered/bottled -- no worries. Anyway, make sure you try out some authentic Mexican food in town -- cheap and delicious. We ate away from there 3-4 times and it was all good. The beach: I will post a picture or two, but it's hard to tell since I took them from the pool deck. A lot of people used the beach. We got into the water and that was fun -- watch out for that surf. You can get boogie boards and those looked like a blast. The pool is RIGHT by the sea. You feel like it's ON the beach, so there's no reason to get all salty and sandy and be away from the food/drinks/fun that only the pool area has! You can take a break and walk down the beach, jump in the sea, but we really preferred being by the pool. Playa del Carmen is a 20 minute walk, 5 minute taxi ride. Take the taxi -- it's only 40 pesos. We went into town 6 times and it only cost us about $60, round trip. It's too hot to walk during the day and not recommended at night. Plus, you're walking around once you get there -- you don't want to be all worn out. There are so many shops and outdoor restaurants it's a lot of fun. There are live bands at night -- they were all good. We only caught parts of two shows at the hotel because we went into town almost every night. But those were very good and may get YOU involved whether you like it or not. Just remember no one knows you but the people you came with, and they'll get a kick out of whatever they make you do! It's fun. Complaint #1: Time share (vacation club) salespeople. The front people are very sweet and low pressure. Then they bring you to the heavy hitters and boy, can you feel cheap and stupid fast! I don't know why we did that. For free Cozumel ferry tickets? It would have been well worth our time and money to buy them and skip the sales pitch. We lost a precious two hours of our vacation time. Well, you never know, you MAY be interested in it. It's not a bad deal for the people that can use it. Complaint #2: Lounge chair saving. People are out saving their pool chairs at 6:00 a.m. (or earlier?) That wouldn't be SO bad if they actually used them. Some people next to us used their chairs for about 1/2 an hour all day, but saved them with their towels and belongings ALL DAY LONG. I don't know what could be done about that because they charge you for your towel if you lose it, so no one dares MOVE a towel that's been sitting there all day. All in all, the best features of the resort are the friendly staff -- hard working -- very long hours for those pool guys (players -- they are also entertaining at night) -- the beautiful, peaceful setting -- and the guacamole.

Stayed March 12 -17, 2005. We were made aware of the erosion problems after we had booked and paid for our room but decided to make the most of it and go. We traveled with two children (9 and 3) and they had a great time. Rooms: We had a first floor room, initially we wanted to upgrade to closer to the pool or ocean, but stayed in our room which turned out to be a good thing. We weren't bothered by late-night noise from the pool or the disco. Yes, the beds are incredibly hard, my hips were begging for my Serta. The kids slept soundly, as did my husband. There is Cartoon Network available in english or spanish which the kids enjoyed when they had to wait for Mom and Dad to get stuff together. Housekeeping did a great job for us and left extra bottles of water (3) everyday for us. All in all it was an accomodating room for sleeping in and showering. Food: There was kid friendly food available, pizza, hotdogs, hamburgers and fries. The breakfast buffet was fine, the children were happy and the egg lady was friendly. Lunch and Dinner Buffet were food, I cannot say that the food was exceptional, there was variety but in my opinion it was bland food. Buffet isn't my thing, but I didn't go hungry. I prefer european plan and taking the adventure and trying a new place nightly downtown, but with the kids in tow this year, there is no other way to go than all inclusive. Beer: The beer is Corona on tap. There are cans of Modelo available to some rooms.. not mine. The bar staff was very friendly and made all sorts of blended cocktails. Resort Grounds: It was beautiful. The groundskeepers should be commended, each day they rake up the fallen leaves and you have a garden to peruse at your leisure. Flowers in bloom, Iguana's, little lizards, it was fun to walk the grounds with the children to spot something new. Of course the lack of beach was a disappointment, but the kids wanted to be in the pool constantly. The surf was Awesome!! Abusive sure, dangerous too.. but warm water and exhaustive to play in. We thoroughly enjoyed the ocean anyway. Fun Club: The fun club is the resort staff provided to encourage you to participate in various activities, yoga, water aerobics, dance lessons, water volleyball, water polo, etc. They were around all day and constantly had upbeat attitudes and were friendly and engaging. The ladies of Kids Club ages 4-12 were very friendly and encouraging to the children, they had endless energy. Location: PDC is only a couple of miles away and without a beach your methods of getting there are walk, ride a bike (available through the resort) or take a cab. Cab was only 4$ usd each way. The one thing that I have to comment on. Although the staff is commendable in the multi lingual aspect, it lacks in encouraging you to use your spanish. Each year I hope to get better at my spanish, and it wasn't necessary, or encouraged to use spanish. I had hoped that my children would need to use it more, kind of an imersion, but they didn't need to and weren't encouraged at all?? All in all, we met some wonderful people while staying at the Allegro and will keep in touch with them, but it is doubtfull that we will ever stay at the Allegro again. PDC isn't for my kids, I didn't enjoy keeping the kids out of the shops. I will do all-inclusive again with the kids, perhaps in Cozumel hoping for fewer waves at the beach. But if I choose to go to PDC, I will find a hotel in town on a european plan for my hubby and I.", "Date": "March 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "Fifiann", "ReviewID": "UR3283090", "Content": "We stayed at the Allegro in October 2004 on a half price Funjet all inclusive vacation. The Allegro is a good value 3 star resort on the edge of Playa Del Carmen. Please note that it is a three star. Many reviewers on this site have clearly gone there with 5 star expectations and so of course they were disappointed. The hotel is set in acres of beautifully maintained tropical gardens and the rooms are in small thatched buildings. The rooms are spacious enough and clean but no frills and the bathrooms are a little worn. They all enjoy large decks though with chairs and a hammock and it is a real pleasure to lie out surrounded by all the lush foliage. The beach is pretty but not amazing - if you walk further down the beach to the south it gets wider and less crowded. However, the pools are nice and the beach bar serves all the tropical drinks you could ever want. The buffet food is extensive and although not exactly gourmet, most people would be able to find something that appeals to them. Buffet food always gets boring after 3 days so I would recommend a meal out in Playa Del Carmen one night. The Italian restaurant at the hotel was hard to get a booking for and if you are only there for 3 or four nights it can be impossible. Our rep managed to wrangle one for us after we complained that the system was badly set up and penalised short stay visitors but unfortunately we were unable to use it in the end as we got back too late from a day trip. Personally, for just a few days, I enjoyed the snack food available from the beach bar. There are plenty of recreational activities available for free - hobie cat, kayacking etc and for a fee - scuba diving and parasailing and we had a lot of fun with these. I would recommend a day trip to Xcaret which offers lots of activities like floating down underwater rivers, swimming with dolphins and a fantastic butterfly enclosure. Try to go as a group in a taxi. The tour operator excursion was outrageously expensive. They add $30 a head onto the park admission fee to transport you there and it is literally 5 minutes drive away! I would not go to the Allegro for a honeymoon or to renew my wedding vows but it is an attractive, friendly and fun (but not too noisy) place for couples, singles and families alike who are looking for a good value short break.", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomington, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3282349", "Content": "Just returned on March 14 after a week's stay...had a wonderful time... encountered no problems at all...food was delicious--quite a variety and choice of selections...rooms just great -- very clean.

We went with 3 other couples and one of the reasons we went back to Playa Del Carmen was because of the water and the beaches. To see the majority of the beach gone, we were very sad but not surprised. Our main objective this vacation was to relax and really become beach bums and we pretty much accomplished that. 2 couples had second floor rooms and 2 couples had first floor rooms, the second floor rooms were very noisy with birds and critters and the first floor rooms were very musty and all rooms had hard beds. If you are a light sleeper do not get a second floor room. If you have a first floor room and keep the air conditioning off during the day and run it early evening you can get rid of most of the musty smell. Thought the food was pretty good at the main buffet, but limited choices at the snack bar by the pool. The chips/cheese/salsa was very good and had that every day and also the pizza was good - It was very nice to have pizza at night at 11:00 pm and to go down to the pool bar in the evening instead of just the disco. We ate at the Mexican and Italian restaurants, there was a small amount of food at the Mexican restaurant but we had a lot of fun with the waiters and the uno, dos, tres BAM! red tequila shots, we got a group picture with the somberos and our waiters and was very fun. We also went to the Italian restaurant, food was much better but took way too long - Almost 3 hours for dinner a little too long for our groups taste. We also suggest to get a day pass and go to the Allegro in Cozumel, the beach is beautiful and only costs $15 for a taxi when you get off the ferry, you can also go snorkeling right there at the resort and plenty of beach chairs, we took the 8:00 am ferry and that was plenty of time. Also walked down to the public beach called Mr. Sanchos which took about 20 min. from the resort and they have a bar, restaurant and shopping right there on the beach it was very nice. The day we were leaving there wasn't much left of the beach and they only had a limited amount of chairs, and overall the weather was great, we all came back with great tans, it was very relaxing and when your in Mexico with good friends how can you not have a great time!", "Date": "March 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201c3 Star's a Best\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3268889", "Content": "My husband and I booked a 8 day stay at the Grand Flamenco Xcaret but when we arrived with another couple we met on the plane - we were told that we did not have reservations there but that our reservations were for the Allegro Playacar. Nothing we did or said, including showing our Confirmation #'s helped. (We later found out that they had overbooked by 51 rooms). Their guests (with rooms) were offered 3 different options if they would give up their rooms, including free future stays, we were offered nothing. We even had to pay for the taxi to take us to the Allegro, while it was only $10 it is the principal of the thing that counts. When we arrived at the Allegro we were greeted by the front desk and our bags were immediately taken to our room. After first seeing the Grand Xcaret - what a disappointment!!! The staff at the Allegro was extremely nice and helpful but we had paid for a 5 star resort, not a 3 star. I would compare the Allegro to a Hotel 6, functional and adequate but definetly not what we paid for. The gounds are beautiful, beds are short and hard, we never had any problem with bugs but the rooms smelled musty and damp from the thatched roof. They look nice but my allergies absolutely did not like the smell. As far as the food goes, the buffet offered great variety but nothing was ever hot or even warm. We didn't go hungry but I want my hot food hot and my cold food cold. We were approached numerous times by the timeshare people until we gave in and listened to them. They really pressure you. Of course, they told us we wouldn't have had the problems we did if we were members. My feelings are that it shouldn't matter. If you paid for it, you should get what you paid for. We have e-mailed Occidental and am curious to see what they will do about this. The management staff at the Grand Xcaret was RUDE, especially their Manager, Raoul Martin. Even tho' he confirmed to our travel agent that he knew we had valid reservations, he told us we didn't and then ignored us, refusing to even acknowledge that we were there. Reading some of the reviews, I have the feeling that Occidental has a BIG problem with overbooking. In the good old USA, it is called FRAUD, but in Mexico they get by with it. If you are only looking for a neat, clean place to stay with no ammenities, then Allegro Playacar will be great. The beach is gone but that is no one's fault but mother nature. The only thing that Allegro has going for it is that it is only a short distance from Playa del Carmen.

If you like a hard bed, this might be acceptable for you. The walls, bathroom sinks and floors in the bathrooms are also made of concrete and then painted. The electricity went out twice in one week. The ceiling in the room was leaking until finally, a piece of dry-wall fell into the bathtub...luckily no one was in the shower at the time.

We enjoyed our vacation very much. When we arrived it was a great shock to see we had no beach - because the main reason we went to this area was because of the ocean and beach. We had no warning from Signature or our travel agent about this although I had read some reviews on the Trip Advisor. It was worse than we imagined. Also, trying to go swimming in the ocean was difficult because of the sandbags under the water. We did go in front of other resorts to enjoy the beach - but you have no drinks or chairs - so not really very nice. The positives first: The food at the buffet we found was excellent and lots of variety. We booked at the a la carte restaurants, Mexican and Italian once each, but found the food was better at the buffet. We also went into PDC twice and ate at local restaurants. The staff were excellent and very friendly. We tipped sometimes, but it didn't matter either way because we had good service. The grounds are beautiful and very neat and clean. Our room was adequate, but kept very clean by the staff. We were on the second floor under the palapa roof - I didn't really like that - but had no problems with musty smell or insects. Negatives were that the beds are very hard. We had a pad put on the bed but it didn't make much difference. We have stayed in many other resorts in Mexico but this bed was the hardest yet. There were not enough beach chairs - some people almost came to blows because of disputes over the chairs. Because of the lack of beach, space was very limited around the pool so that could have been part of the problem. We went over to the Allegro in Cozumel twice. It was wonderful and I recommend it. Despite costing us $50.00 cdn to go each trip it was worth it to enjoy the beach. I wonder if Signature would reimburse the cost?

I traveled with my mother and 4yr old daughter and we all had a great time! The only caveat to those booking their trips now... there is absolutely no beach left! We walked along the shore by the other hotels, and their beaches were great, so if beachfront is important to you, try the Gala, Iberostar or RIU. Other than the beach, the place was excellent! The rooms were small and yes, the beds were hard, but not unbearable. The grounds were beautiful, the food was great, the staff was very friendly, and there were tons of activities and entertainment for everyone. My daughter really enjoyed the kids club and my mom loved the shows at night. If you play tennis, they have a fabulous tennis coach (Isaac) on staff, and you can get free lessons every morning, or private lessons for only $25 (a steal!) Also, don't bother getting an \"upgraded\" room, it's the exact same room with a location closer to the beach (which also means closer to the noise), and an electronic room safe, that's all. We had one of these rooms and asked to be moved after the first night b/c the noise from the bar and restaurant were too much for my daughter to sleep at night. They were very accomodating and moved us the next day to a much more quiet room. If you're looking for peace and quiet, try the rooms in the 3200s or 3400s, if you want to be right next to the pool and bar, the 5200s are the best. The resort location was great, a short walk or $4 cab ride to town where you can shop or catch the ferry to Cozumel. You can get a day pass to the Allegro property there (which we did) and have full privelages there for the day. The resort there is almost identical, but they have a great beach and the water there is much calmer for those who want to swim in the ocean.

Men worked everyday filling sand bags and placing them along the beach. Palm trees had fallen over and the beach was inaccessible. There was a sign posted apologizing for the loss of the beach due to seasonal changes. That was a little too late to tell us since we were already there. I didn't care about the pools I wanted a resort with a beautiful beach front, and that is what I was looking for when we were booking in December. The hotel management said that the beach had been gone for about 2-3 months and that the Tour companies were aware of this and that we should have been told. Well we were not told this by Signature Vacations or our travel agent at Sear Travel. Signature vacations must be getting compensated for this from the hotel but they are not passing on to their customers. I did not pay $ 4,200 to see a washed up beach. As well, we had asked for a suite closer to the beach or pool well we couldn't get further from both we were beside the disco. When we complained the hotel management said that thoughs suites near the beach and pool are for time share holders and vacation club guests. They said that there where only about 10 units left on the resort for the tour companies and they where at the back, and showed us on the map of the resort. When we arrived at the airport in Cancun we recieved a card from a Signature representative to meet in the lobby at the resort the next morning at 11:00, there we would meet Catherine and she would fill us in on all the amenities. We waited from 10:45 to 11:30 in the lobby and she never showed up. We got our information from the hotel management. We never did meet anyone from Signature vacations.

As customers we should be made aware of the conditions of the beach especially as it had already been gone for 2-3 months.

We were there from 10am-5pm and still didn't do all we wanted. They have tubing, snorkeling, caves, cliff jumps and more. A short walk to Playa provided a day of shopping- just stay on 5th Avenue! We also parasailed in front of the resort- it was great! We would definately stay again. We did not expect the royal treatment and were just happy to be on vacation in such a beautiful, clean and friendly resort.

The property and all the facilities were clean and well maintained. Yes the beds were hard and not much of a beach, but not the hotel's fault. We like a hard bed, so that was OK. We spent some time every day on the beach - although not very expansive (due to the loss of a good deal of beach due to the hurricane's in the late summer of 2004) and found a lounge each time. The ocean was crystal clear blue and a refreshing, with little undertow. How much beach does 1 or 2 people need??? All of the staff were friendly and very helpful, including the front desk, at no time did we fell any of the staff expected a tip for the outstanding service. We enjoyed the food at the buffet and both restaurants - but make your reservations as soon after check in as possible - they fill up quick. This was my second trip to Mexico and I enjoyed our stay at the Allegro much more than my prior trip. It was smaller, but I felt you got to know staff better, and had as much in activitites and amentities as the hotel we stayed at in downtown Cancun. The shows were Ok - if you saw one, you saw them all - lots of dancing, but at least it was something to do after dinner, in stead of going to town. Drinks were free flowing and they would make anything requested, on one particular night I was in the mode for a flavored martini and the bartendar made me one of the best melon martini's I ever had.

At first, all I could see were the poor conditions, despite the tourism, Playa Del Carmen is poor by Canadian standards. After a week, I saw a region rich with life and realized that the happiness the locals show is genuine. This, and the beaches, will bring me back every year. Now on to the resort itself. Luckily, I was a trip advisor reader, and was prepared for this resort. To confirm, beds are hard, bathrooms often smell of raw sewage, walls are made of paper. Birds are noisy, and something I haven't read yet, BATS are everywhere at night. Not a problem, just beware of falling guana. My friend has a stain that just won't come out.. Despite the bathroom smell, the rooms were very clean, sheets and towels fresh smelling. I brought a small mist air deoderizor, and we kept the garbage pail over the drain in the bathroom and the door shut. The beach, or what is left of it. Take the advertisment pictures and cut the beach in half. We didn't have a problem finding a chair on the beach, as long as we were up at 6:00am to put our towels down! By the way, leave only the towels. Some people mentioned their books being stolen, and I had a hat stolen. Otherwise, the ocean front is breathtaking. Other things to mention, do not be fooled by people in dress shirts with name tags who look like they are hotel guides. If they ask you to breakfast, or any meal, be wary. They are time share salespeople. Fine if you are interested in time shares, but a warning, a breakfast with one can take up your entire morning. I was with my friend, and we were not their target. Beware if you are a couple. I've seen many comments on the food. The buffet food does tire after a week. The desserts are all made of geletin, no pastry chefs here. The Italian restaurant was very good. I would suggest making your reservations early. We found that the 6:30pm reservations were the best. After that, they get behind, and some people were waiting up to two hours for their reservation. The staff is awesome. Regardless if you tip or not, it is just their nature. I did take more than $50 in ones, and glad of it. The hotel does not readily exchange large bills to small, and in town, they prefer to give you change in pesos. The nightly entertainment was top notch. Something for everyone. If you are interested in excursions, a small and affordable one is the \"Marj and Glen\" Tulum Experience. It will only cost you $4 for the bus out of Playa Del Carman and $4 for your entry into the ruins. It will however cost you $12 in bandaids if you do not wear socks with your shoes. Also included is the cardi workout through Playa Del Carmen backyards, a good way to work off that buffet! In summary, this hotel is not a 5-star. YOu will be disappointed if you are looking for high class and luxury. What you will get is a hotel that is unpretentious, a place without airs, with a group of people who will all complain about their rooms, while sitting in 86 degree weather, sipping beverages, with an ocean the colour of turquoise as their backdrop.

The front desk service was terrible extremely terrible, we were booked for a superior room with king size bed and a beach view. We got a room with two double beds and an awful location. They were willing to move us but not until someone checked out. Or toilette was always in need of a plunger as the service man carried around in this plastic bag.

There is plenty of room around the pool, But get there early to reserve a lounge chair. Service was excellent. A large variety of drinks to choose from. A little tipping goes along way. Food was okay but after a week it got a little boring which is to be expected. The rooms were small but nice. Beds were hard but you are so tired at the end of the day you could sleep any where.

Loved it!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3099004", "Content": "We booked our week last fall and then began to read all the reviews about this resort going downhill, losing its beach, marginal food, problems with the room, bugs, noise, etc. I want to write that my wife and I and another couple vacationed here last week (January 20 - January 27) to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversaries and we absolutely had a wonderful week. We're from Des Moines, Iowa and it was about 70 degrees warmer in Mexico. I'll try to address one issue at a time to put you at ease if you have planned a trip here or are about to. 1) Funjet .. We booked through a travel agent but it was a ..Funjet trip. Our airline filed bankruptcy and cancelled some flights including ours and Funjet had other options for us within 2 days. The flight times were even better for us. 2) Reception staff at the Allegro (front desk). We had no problems at all. There wasn't a line, we were checked in promptly, our bags were taken immediately to our rooms. I do need to point out that we vacationed from a Thursday to a Thursday. Perhaps there are problems on the weekends or at holiday times. 3) Overbooking ..while it may happen, it didn't to us. Again, maybe coming in on a Thursday helped us. 4) Small rooms ...We did not travel to Mexico for a large room. We went for vacation. The room was more than adequate in both size and features. Our room was somewhat near the pool and the beach and I feel that is probably preferable. You need to walk farther to the buffet, but you are close to the action. 5) Hard beds .. yes, they were harder than we were used to, but we had no problems getting to sleep and we did not request additional padding. We received our request of a King bed and it served a dual purpose as a place to spread out our stuff during the day depending on what we needed for the next activity. After a full day of activities, we had no trouble going to sleep. 6) The grounds... they are beautiful, well maintained, watered, and its paradise. 7) The food ...no problems. We had no difficulty in getting reservations to both the Mexican and the Italian restaurants. You must make your reservation at least a day ahead. Not a problem. Even though we had success, I could understand the possibility of scheduling problems, as there are a lot of guests and only so much seating in these restaurants. The menu was fine and the atmosphere was great. We were very satisfied with the buffet, but it was nice to break up the week with some sit down menu service and a more leisurely meal. The buffet food was varied and plentiful. Breakfast allows you to have a smoothie or an omelet made to your order. Lots of fruit, juices, cereals, cold meats, pancakes, etc. One surprise entree for breakfast that we came to enjoy was refried beans! If you get busy (or lazy) at the pool, there is food service near the pool so you don't even need to change out of your swimsuit. I recommend the hot dog and tuna pizza (seriously!) 8) Shopping ...you have 2 choices within walking distance. Plaza Playacar is a small shopping center that also doubles as a pick up spot for some tours in case they don't originate at the Allegro. It is a 5-minute walk at most. The other walking option is downtown Playa del Carmen. It's a strong 15-minute walk (or a $5 cab ride). While I suggest asking the cab fare before you get in, we were always quoted $5 and that's what it was. You will want to look for or get directions to 5th Avenue. We had to go twice as there was more shopping than we could accomplish in one afternoon. While the bars and restaurants were very enticing, we had our meals at the Allegro. Shopping tip: prices are negotiable even in many of the brick and mortar stores, especially the jewelry ones. I had the price of a pair of shot glasses go from $16 to $3 in one negotiating session. Do some comparison-shopping if you like to wheel and deal. 9) Noisy birds ... this may be a problem if you get a room upstairs. We were on level one and did not have a problem. Occasionally you could hear the birds and perhaps more often in the morning, but they never woke us up. 10) Bugs in the rooms ... yes, there were some small bugs crawling around. I expect that it's hard to avoid. They caused us no trouble and were not a bother. 11) Activities ... there were many activities to join in or watch or ignore. It's your vacation. The resort simply provides opportunities. There was a show every night and they were always entertaining. A bit too much dancing in the shows to suit my tastes, but they were excellent dancers. Some of the comedy bits and audience participation events were very funny and entertaining. 12) Fiesta night is Monday. Meal is served outdoors and there was a mariachi band. 13) Tours ... we actually booked our tours off site and were very satisfied. Tours can be booked on-site but you may wish to shop around a bit. Options include taking a \"free tour\" at Allegro or another resort (this is an attempt to sell a vacation club membership). We did so and did not buy but we did get free tours. There are also tour sales in town right on the street. Not really any need to pay a higher price for the same tour just because it is being sold at your resort. Note that if you buy elsewhere, you may get picked up at a site other than at the Allegro. If you do, be very sure you know where it is that you are being picked up..and do not rely on the reps on site (Allegro) if you purchased elsewhere. We were misled and almost missed a tour. 14) Cocktail service .. not only were the drinks tasty, they were made to order if possible. Some bars did not always have Kahlua, but the substitute was nearly as good. Also, while you could go up to the bar (walk up or swim up), there was often waiter service even while you were lounging in your chair. 15) The showers ... you have read about them in other reviews. Rather than being upset, we laughed about it. Other than not having a door, the shower was fine. It was large enough, the water was hot, towels were close, and it was always dry by the next morning. Complaints should only be if the room doesn't have a shower or it doesn't work. 16) The staff ... We did not have a single problem with any Allegro employee. They were always accommodating, helpful, and wearing a smile. 17) Tips are not necessary to get superb service. We tipped only for luggage handling and for our housekeeper..those towel designs left on the bed were very enjoyable. 18) The beach ... yes it washed away. Yes, it's not what it used to be. But, there is still some beach, still chairs on it, still beach activities, still beach swimming, kayaking, etc. Enjoy what you have. Don't despair over what couldn't have been prevented.

We had one little, tiny spot on the \"sand bar\" and were asked to move because they needed to fill sand bags from our spot. What's a vacation on the Riveria Maya without a beach??? 2.) We found the front desk staff to be rude and unconcerned with our (daily) problems. We had requested a 2nd floor non-smoking room and they put us in a 1st floor smoking room directly across from the pool bar. When they FINALLY moved us, it was a 2nd floor room directly outside of the theatre where they did the nightly shows. We couldn't have slept if we wanted to. We asked to be moved to a different room when someone else checked out, but they never did. They said it was over-booked (we were not asking for an ADDITIONAL room, just to be moved when someone else left - let the next people have our room). 3.) Everything you read about the horrible beds being too hard is SO true! My husband slept in the hammock outside the room most nights. 4.) Our toilet kept over flowing and the sink and tub took hours to drain. Since there is no curtain or door on the shower that just drained onto the bathroom floor. It also took at least 30 minutes of continually running the water in the mornings before it even got luke warm. 5.) For an All-Inclusive place, if you don't tip the maid, you get little service. Also, do not trust that the maid will not touch your personal belongings. Lock up anything and everything of any value to you. I learned this lesson the hard way. 6.) The two \"specialty\" restaurants were the 2 worst meals we ate there. We had to make reservations for them and even then we had to wait for 45 minutes at the Italian place. 7.) On the good side - the service staff were some of the nicest people I've ever met. They bust their butts to please you - it's the managing staff that need improvement.

Every room had small chairs and a table out on the deck and a hammock. 15 minute walk to Playa del Carmen. Hotel internet never worked, but dial up connections in Mexico have lots of problems.

We read the reviews and were skeptical after booking our trip but figured we would go to the Allegro with an open mind (1/9/05-1/16/05). Our first impressions were not good after seeing the front of several other resorts on the way. The Allegro has a smaller facade than other resorts, the beach had washed away, and yes, the beds are extremely hard. Despite this we went to sleep the first night excited for our first day. Among four star resorts the Allegro is five stars. The ages range, but if you're concerned about kids it was never an issue. You hardly notice the ones that are there, yet those that were seemed to have a great time. The advice to treat the staff as friends rather than servants couldn't be more correct. The few words of Spanish I spoke kept the staff smiling and they couldn't be happier to make you drinks all day long. Good advice is to bring $50US in singles for tipping. It's not mandatory or even expected half the time but a dollar here and there gets you a long way. The beds are hard - so what, you're only there for a few hours anyway, we slept just fine. There are no alarm clocks and language barrier becomes a problem sometimes for wake up calls, but the birds were pretty effective at letting us know it was time to wake up every day (we were on the 2nd floor). The shower is odd with this small piece of glass and no curtain but it didn't cause a mess and the water was plenty hot. The house keeper was outstanding (left towel sculptures every day with flowers on them). Overall, the grounds were very clean and well kept. The Fun Club was the best. Estevan and Andres kept us occupied all day in the pool with water polo, tequila volleyball, or whatever other crazy game they had planned. Definitely go to Cancun with Estevan if you're into that sort of thing - Coco Bongo is wild. What beach is left is beautiful and even though the forecast called for rain it was beautiful every single day (10 minutes of rain). On that note bring PLENTY of sun block. If you need to re-up in mexico, they charge $17US everywhere in mexico. We never heard from a single person about any timeshare or anything like that, so I don't know what people are talking about with pushy sales people. The people who do solicit you on the beach are parasail or jet-ski people but we even made friends with a few of them. Not interested? \"No gracias.\" Is all you need. Take advantage of all there is to offer. The service and the food in the sit down restaurants were outstanding (and we're from NY - we hate everything). Also, we had no problem getting reservations and we didn't do it the first night. Just remember it's called a \"reservation\" - first come first serve. The buffets are exactly that - a buffet. The food is not gourmet, but they are making food for a large amount of people and attempting to keep things fresh for hours on end. We had no problem finding something to eat. On the beach I think we took part in every activity there was to offer both motorized and non-motorized. Their outdoor massage right by the beach is awesome. For expeditions the Tulum/Xel-ha tour is fantastic - they don't tell you how beautiful these places are. Playa Del Carmen is nice but you have to look around to find the really cool places. Playa is where the pushy people are. They will call you as you walk down the street and try to coax you into their store, but those people are just trying to make a living - it's a very friendly atmosphere. Try Deseo (trendy rooftop lounge type bar), The Blue Parrot (on the beach with swings for seats), and maybe the pub crawl (Carlos&Charlies, Senor Frogs, and some other place), and take a cab to Aleux - it's a restaurant in caves that's amazing. We had no problem with the water. We brushed our teeth with bottled water but other than that the glasses on your table at dinner are filled with bottled water and the ice is purified in the frozen drinks so drink away!! The key is that those who complain a lot never have fun anywhere they go. We didn't go out looking for this vacation to be Cancun-style-crazy, just a good time at the beach away from the snow.

I have never been to Mexico or stayed in an AI, so although I rated this resort as \"average\", it is not intended as a comparison to any other resort. What I mean by average is that some parts were good, some could have been improved. 1. Grounds/staff. The grounds were clean and well kept. The pools are nice and big enough. We did not have any trouble finding a recliner in the morning, but I noticed that they did fill up in the early afternoon. The beach, for the most part, was gone (only a few feet wide at times). Our rep told us that Hurricane Ivan caused a lot of erosion, which exposed the rocks. As the rocks became exposed, the sea hit harder, which caused more erosion, and so on until there is very little beach. I don't know if this explanation is true or not, but the beach is gone. The staff, with the exception of the front desk, are friendly and will do their best to accomodate you. The front desk staff seem oblivious to you, and ignore you whenever possible. Stay away from the man who calls himself the concierge - he is a time share salesman. 2. Rooms. Small, but clean. The best comparison I can think of is a Motel 6 in the U.S. Adequate, but not luxurious. I did not go to Mexico to spend time in my room, however. The beds are hard, but no one in my group of 6 had trouble sleeping. Our A/C worked almost too well. 3. Food/drink. As others have said, breakfast is the best meal, but we always found something to eat, and no one in my group of 6 had any digestive problems. This is buffet-style food designed to feed the masses, not gourmet. Like going to a too-large wedding where quantity is more important than quality. If you want bacon, ask a waiter. Lunch at the pool was better (chicken wings, burgers, chicken, fish, salads, nachos) than lunch in the cafeteria. My wife said the fish at the pool snack bar was very good. The pizza bar had frozen pizza with some regular toppings and some very strange toppings (for instance, hot dog pieces). We ate dinner at the Mexican restaurant once, which was good. No trouble making reservations. We did not try the Italian restaurant. Drinks - we had no problems getting drinks and the bar staff will add more alcohol if you ask. The resort serves only two beers - Corona and a darker beer called Negro Modela. Both are draft. If you want non-draft beer, any of the little sundries stores on 5th Avenue in PDC sell Bud, Bud Lite, and/or Coors Light for $1.00 USD per can. 4. Entertainment. The activities pool seemed always busy, and everyone seemed to be having fun. The shows at night are not Broadway, but if you want Broadway, go to NYC. They consist mostly of dancing men, dancing women in thongs, and lip-syncing. 5. Surrounding area/activities. We went on the Koba/Pac Chen tour offered by Alltournatives. The tour company is good, and the tour is good. Doing group activities can be annoying, though, because you are always waiting for someone. Bring pesos and rent a bike at Koba. The main pyramid is about a 30 minute walk, which does not leave much time for exploring it or the other ruins unless you ride. PDC is about a mile away from the Allegro Playacar.

Eight of the kids were l7 to early 20's and they had an absolute blast as they were participants in most of the activities that were presented. The activities staff did a superb job at organizing the water polo, water games, volleyball etc. We had read so many poor reviews of the Allegro before we went but we wasnted to let other people know it was a perfect place for a family group. If you were there as a couple and wanted peace and quiet, it might not please you. We were in the 5600 building, had a bit of an ocean view and close to the pools etc. It was noisy in the daytime, but that was just fine as we weren't in the room anyway. The food was pretty good. There was a lot of choice at breakfast - we had every lunch down at the snack bar, but some went upstairs to have a more sedate lunch. They had great soups, hamburgers, pizza, salad bar and wonderful guacamole and nachos. They did have a different main meat or fish every night - pork roast, roast beef, or lamb. The vegetables were fine and always fruit, salads and the pasta section. We were there l3 nights and ate at the Mexican restaurant twice and the Italian once. The entertainment was fun - we were there every night and our kids or some of the grandkids were always participating so we enjoyed it. It was better than my expectations. The grandkids enjoyed the disco, but also went into Playa a few times. My husband had to see the doctor as his cold was so bad and the medication he put him on was the answer, so maybe we were just lucky. He seemed like a nice little man and has an office at the hotel. A holiday is what you bring to it and maybe we were fortunate that we had no negative happenings. By the way we were never approached by the timeshare people at the hotel. They were sitting there every day but never called us over or bothered us. The staff were very happy and pleasant and we had lots of fun with some of the wait staff.

While this was an \"upgrade\" for them, my husband and I were not allowed to visit, use facilities or dine at their location.

The hotel staff blamed the reservation agency in Spain and operators such at Funjet and Worry Free vacations for the overbookings. We booked through Funjet, who when confronted, blamed the hotel. - The hotel was nice with activities throughout the days like Spanish lessons, yoga, water games for teenagers and nightly shows (mostly geared toward families with preteen or teenage kids). The Italian and Mexican restaurants (reservations req'd) were difficult to book with available dining times at between 8:30 - 9:30 pm, were very tasty and worthwhile. The buffet was to be expected with same or similar food at every meal. - I must commend the wait staff, housekeeping and on-site Lomas Travel, who organized the excursions. They all did an excellent job! The front desk staff and guest services left much to be desired when it came to customer service. The hotel was still overbooked by 4 rooms when we checked out and we never did receive the hammock we daily requested for our balcony. - Despite the issues, we choose to have a good vacation.

Complaints: 1/ Thatched roof hotel units - The birds pecking on the roof got us up bright and early every morning. If you like rustic, this is it! Beds were also very hard, the rooms were too small to unpack your luggage. Water leaked from the shower as there were not shower doors. Overall - just plain bad! 2/ Front desk personal - not helpful, time share people pushy, maids were good only if you tipped them. 3/ Meals were ok, lots of food but not alot of variety. If you like seafood you won't find any here. Isn't it funny that shrimp and langostinos are so prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico, but you can't get them at your resort? We had to go into Playa Del Carmen to get some great seafood. 4/ Beach got washed away, every other hotel along the strip had a great beach except the Allegro 5/ 2 small pools, one for relaxing and one for fun. No waterslides for the kids! Also very very cold! You couldn't sit close to the pool as you would get wet from the Tequila Volleyball or Water Polo players as well as the aquasizers. Good Points: 1/ The Allegro Fun Staff that organized games etc around the pool were awesome, they had a variety of entertainment going all day and into the night. Estevan was great! 2/ The grounds were beautiful and the place was very clean 3/ The Italian Restaurant had the best food but you could only go once! 4/ Drinks were good 5/ Evening entertainment was ok but started at 9:30 almost too late. Overall kind of disappointing, our stay at the Palladium was far superior for about the same price. Would not go back to the Allegro.

We arrived on Dec. 23rd around 11:10 A.M. and we were told that check-in wasn't until 3:00 P.M. We had been up since 3:00 A.M. with nothing to eat during this time. The Buffet had closed, and the Snackbar didn't open until 12:00 noon. I have stayed at several other all-inclusive resorts, and they always had some sort of food service available. We asked if there was a room available for us to change clothes, and we were told to use the Restrooms in the Lobby if we wanted to.

We booked our honeymoon through Apple Vacations (another joke for a different time) for 12-27-2004 through 12-31-2004. When we arrived at Allegro, we tried to check in with the Reception Desk and were directed to Guest Relations. After a 10-15 minute wait, Peter informed us that the US offices of Occidental had overbooked the resort for Monday night and would like to transport us to a \"5 star hotel just 15 minutes away\", The Copacobana (which, btw, was awesome!). We half expected this since we had read reviews on this site Sunday before we left. This was really not a problem and it turned out that the Copacabana was so much better than Allegro that after we returned to Allegro, we wished we had insisted on staying at the Copa. We were whisked off in a van to be driven to the Copa which was NOT a 15 minute drive, more like 25-30 minute drive. Upon our arrival, we were checked quite quickly and given our room (it was not 3:00 check in time, so that was a nice surprise. We didn't have to sit around the resort until room was ready). We booked our tours/excursions with the Copa Tours rep and worked everything out so that we would be dropped off on Tuesday evening at the Allegro and picked up and dropped off Thursday at Allegro-no problems. HOWEVER-things did not turn out as such once we returned to Allegro on Tuesday night. After we checked in (we were supposed to have the \"Honeymooner's package\" which was fresh flowers in the room when checking in and breakfast in bed at some point of the stay) and went to our room, it was a little disappointing compared to the Copa and the Chameleon Marival (which I stayed at in March 2004). It was clean, but very small. It would have fit into either of the rooms at the other two resorts and the bathroom was small but adequate, I guess. After we got settled, we walked down to the beach-or what used to be the beach! The first thing we saw was yellow tape tied to various palm trees and sandbags piled up. The Beach was about 10-15 feet from the sea wall that separated the private property from the public beach. Well, that was OK since we really weren't going to be sitting out there that night trying to enjoy the sun. The next morning after breakfast, we strolled down to the \"beach\" area again, to check things out; see how crowded the area was and if there was chance we could sit in the sun...The beach had shrunk even more! And the \"no reserving chairs\" rule was blatently not enforced. People had personal belongings (towels, shoes, etc) on the chairs, but were obviously not sitting in them. They had saved them earlier-but whatever. So we went back to our room and returned later in the morning. At that time, there were workers from the hotel ( I guess) filling sandbags and stacking them around the few palm trees that were scattered around the 'beach front' as well as the little Tiki huts. We were asked to move to another part of the 'beach' because they needed that area of sand to fill the bags. They worked on sandbagging all day (they were still working later in the afternoon right before sunset). The following morning, I walked down to the 'beach' area again and the Tiki huts where my husband and I had been sitting the evening before, were laying in the ocean. Since very few of the miscellaneous workers spoke English, it was difficult to find out what happened. Another American tourist staying at the resort told me that someone told her that beach started washing away about a week or so before, and they had no idea why. In fact, when you looked up and down the coastline, all of the resorts were lacking a 'beach front'. What happened?? If you would like to see pictures, email me and I will send them to you. As for the buffet food-it was OK. Nothing to write home about-and that went for every meal; breakfast, lunch and dinner. We made reservations at the Italian restauraunt-if you like Chef Boyardee lasagna or ravioli, than you would LOVE their food. The ambiance was nice; it was nice to be waited on and very relaxing; and the service was good, but the food stunk. My husgand is still having some digestive problems, 2 days later. Overall, compared to the other two resorts I have stayed in, this was very disappointing. The only compensation for our inconveniences of being moved to the other resort was just that. They told us it was a 5 star resort, and we looked online when we got home to find it was only a 4 star (however, Allegro needs to take some lessons from the Copa as far as 4 star resorts are concerned). If you want to stay at an awesome resort-book here and have them send you elsewhere, since overbooking seems like a common practice. Insist on staying at the better resort and demand compensation such as a total refund,free tickets to whatever excursions or tours you would have paid for, etc (a tip from another visitor who got treated like royalty for complaining).

I'll keep this as concise as possible. 1) There are no ocean front rooms. Only Ocean front are reserved for Vacation Club. We reserved an Ocean Front, and did not receive. My husband even tried to bribe them, to no avail. Stay away from the Time Share people-they will approach you almost every time you pass to the restaurant. Ask for rooms close to the ocean, or pool-we were in the 4300 blocks--much better than the 1100s- which were by the stage, far from the pools, overlooking the bike racks and parking lot. 2) The food is fine. With regards to the 2 reservations only restaurants, The Italian and The Mexican, make your reservation within the first day of your arrival, or will risk not getting one. don't be late--or they'll cancel your reservation. Of the two, The Italian has better food, but the most horrid lighting--it's like, flourescent. The weird thing is, the lack of avail. on these two restuarants--and yet they were never full when we walked by. I think they are there for appearances, and the hotel is not really motivated to fill them, since they are more costly to man versus the buffet. The buffet is average. 3) The shows: Our kids loved them. Are they broadway? No, but-you're in Mexico, and for our 8, 7 and 18 month old, certainly captivating. Oh, and some of the shows are very entertaining for the men. The girls are pretty, and they qualify for thong use. and they do. 4) Kids Club: Miss janet is great. talk to her if you need a babysitter; she can help you out. The front desk is useless on this, even though they act like they can help you. Go to janet. The kiddie pool is at the Kids club. FYI, you don't really want a room over by the kids club, either. 5) Town: If you want to explore the town, here's what you do: Get up and take one of the bikes into Java Joes, off of Fifth and.. one block south of the street Mosquito Blue Hotel is on. Ronnie and Joel, great 'locals' from new Jersey, make great coffee, and know everything. Thru them we found the best restaurants, etc. Here's a few: Il Pomodoro-- an italian rest. several blocks north, by the Shangri La Caribe hotel--run by a guy from Naples. Very good. Ula Gula, on the corner of Java Joes street (sorry) and 5th. Glass House, part of Mosquito Blue. Hotel Deseo for the hip (which I pride myself on not being) for cocktails- the young crowd is very cool (I'm forty) and the bartenders are great. It's above the street, so away from the cacophony, and worth it. Oscar and Lalos- this is for a trip to Akumal. You will see a sign around mile marker 242, as you head south--it's like an official gov. sign. It's exp. but worth it. Plan on staying. Stores.. Not much, but the area by Mosquito blue has some of the better shops. The flea market area is at the very beginning, just outside the gates of the Playa compound. Last, if you have a need for the Dr. at Allegro, be careful! he overdosed our friends child with an Adult dose of a drug that was supposed to stop him from vomiting, so he could keep down an antibiotic. As the mum is playing cards with him, he freezes, and cannot even speak. she calls the Dr. to tell him what is happening, and he is curt with her, tells her he's done all that he can do, and hangs up on her. She and her husband rush him to the Play Del Carmen Hospital as her pediatrician informed her in advance should anything happen, not the Cancun hospital) in a cab, and save him further damage. If he would have been any smaller, his breathing could have shut down. If they didn't act as quickly as they did... I hope Playa comps their trip, and fires this Dr, which I hope she writes in her review, and gives the specifics. Would we stay there again? No, mainly because of the ocean view room, but otherwise, it was fine. I wouldn't necessarily take older kids (my niece who is 21 did not like it, as it was primarily for younger kids) I would return to Play, but I don't know where we would stay. My husband likes the El Presidente over in Cozumel, which has better food, better staff, not necessarily better grounds. If anyone knows of a better, and it can be more expensive, place in Play that has beach front rooms, let us know. for those of you without kids, the place next door, the Royal Hideway, has a bigger beach, complete with these big bed set ups that is very cool. I can't tell you if it has beach front rooms, as they would not even allow us to walk in and check it out. Oh, and renting a car in town is not really any cheaper than through the hotel.

We have a six year old daughter and we exchanged our time-share week in Florida for this resort, so it's a little different because we didn't \"pay\" to stay here (except for the all-inclusive fee for meals/drinks). I was happier at this resort than at most hotels in the US we've paid $250-300/night for. Yes, there were some minor annoyances, but for every minor annoyance, there were ten great things to make up for it. Yes, the shower only having a 3ft. wide piece of glass on one side of the bath tub - the floor gets a little wet by the tub in the bathroom - but the maid changes out the bath mat every day - not enough to ruin my vacation. We were on the 2nd floor, near the beach and pools which was great. The birds did wake us up every morning around 6:30, which was an annoyance sometimes (the roofs are thatched and they sit on top of the roofs) but I looked at it as a natural alarm clock. No ants, and we had a fruit bowl in our room for a few days. Yes, the beds are hard (as they are in other resorts in Mexico), however we didn't feel the need to get a foam pad. If you need a really soft bed, this may bother you, but since we were exhausted from the day, any bed to lay down it was o.k. with us. We didn't sleep as soundly or comfortably as at home, but again, it didn't ruin our vacation. I've been more annoyed in an upscale hotel where people are yelling in the halls at 2am. There is a hammock and two chairs and table on every porch, which was really nice. My husband and daughter both loved relaxing in the hammock. The food was very good, and there was so much variety that you couldn't possibly try everything, as much as we wanted. For breakfast there was a smoothie station, an omelette/pancake station, and tables loaded with cereals, breads, fruit, meats, cheeses, sausage, and of course the more heartier, typical mexican fare such as pork, chicken and tortilla dishes. As we were always at the pool during lunchtime, we ate at the snack bar every day - it always had soups, meat dishes, all types of cold salads, fish, hamburgers/fries, guacamole, chips, etc, and of course the pizza. I loved the having the snack bar by the pool, because everyone just walked right over in the swimsuits. Dinner was always very good, and there were so many types of food to choose from, we never felt like we were sick of the food. There were beef/pork carvers every night, a pasta station, tostada or fajita stations and then tables and table of other items. Maybe the people who complain about the food don't try new things, are extremely picky and don't realize that different cultures have different ways of preparing and combining foods. Even if you don't want the chicken with mole sauce, there's always roast beef, broccoli, salad and pasta, etc. We travel to other states or countries to try new things - isn't that the point? The drinks were good, and had plenty of alcohol in them. If you ask for a rum and coke that's what you'll get - if you ask for a Bacardi and coke that's what you'll get. The staff at the entire resort was excellent!! We felt totally pampered. The maids were terrific! The wait staff was terrifice, as were the bartenders. Even by the pool someone would pick up your dirty dishes and ask if you needed anything else. We always saw smiles on their faces, and everyone was so fast and accommodating. The activities are FABULOUS! My husband used one of the free boogie boards, we saw the shows every night, the pool activities were a blast to watch even if you didn't participate. You can get pedicures, massages, etc. by the beach or in the spa - there is something for everyone. We did not use the Kids Club, because we wanted to enjoy the time with our daughter, but I would definitely feel comfortable leaving her there next time, after seeing how much the girls there were really good with the kids. You truly never need to leave the resort. There is a tiny shopping area about two blocks from the resort so you don't even need to go in to town if you don't want to. We didn't like the beach area much, as we found the beach in this entire area of resorts a little awkward to walk along and the kids can't really play there like they can on some other beaches because it's VERY narrow. Plus, there are lots of sand bags to keep sand from washing away right in front of the resort, so it can be a tripping hazard. It's also a pain as you walk to keep stepping over the ropes that separate the areas the wave runners, parasail boats, etc. come in. I love the beach if you're in the water or relaxing up on a chair, but not for walking on. Many people were complaining of stubbed toes or tripping on the rocks and sand bags. The grounds are BEAUTIFUL. You can play tennis, basketball, volleyball and even chess on a board with 3-ft tall chess pieces - it was a blast!

We were totally taken back, but let him go on to tell us we must move to another facility down the road, The Riu, which is a 5 star and just sign these papers and go.

The resturants you have to make reservations for but the buffett you can just walk in. The food was of good quality at all places. I guess that is the difference between a 6 star and a 4 star. For the first time though it was magnificent! We had reservations to the Club El Mandarin closer to Cancun and cancelled them becuase of reviews I read on this web site. The reviews said that there was a sewage smell and sure enough as we were driving by on the highway one day, there was a smell for about 3 miles. So if you make reservations near this resort Cancel them. The Occidental Royal Hideaway two places down fromthe Allegro had beds on the beach. It is a 6 star. We will stay there next time and pay the extra 500.00 $.. it's worth it if you can afford it.

Despite what their website says, if your child is 2 or 3, a parent has to stay in the club with them. This was a major problem for us, as we booked this resort because they advertise taking 2+. They made an exception a few of the days and took my daughter for 3 hrs, from 2-5pm, but the sun goes down at 4 so it didn't really work well for us to have a vacation too. Plus there was only 1 very nice girl, Ceidy, running the club and we saw over 15 kids in there almost every day. That's a safety concern. There is no way you can watch this many kids in the pool, on the swingsets, watching TV, and playing Nintendo all at the same time. Also, even if your kids are old enough to come here, you have to pick them up in the middle of the day from 1-2 for the staff lunch break. The kids club facility is very nice, but they need more staff, 1 person can't handle it. Rooms: Small, and the bed is ROCK HARD. We go to Mexico 3 times per year and try new places each time. All beds are hard in Mexico, but these are HARDER. After 3 days we finally got a 1-inch pad that helped but not much. The showers do not have a door or curtain, they have a 2-ft glass shield by the shower head, but it doesnt stop the spray from making the whole bathroom floor wet. Also, we were in a top unit w/a thatched roof. Evidently there were birds nesting up there, we never saw the birds, but we found bird crap on our bed and clothes a few times. Ants: Yes there were alot of ants in the bedroom, all over. We had someone spray 3 times this week and they kept coming back. My husband and daughter were covered in bites, as well as many people we saw on the property. I personally have never had an ant problem in the other resorts of Playacar, and we've stayed at five. Food: This was the worst part. Everything is recycled into casseroles. You never knew what it was, almost every tray was goulash of some sort. We are not that picky, but this place had the worst and smallest selection of any all-inclusive we've stayed at. They have about 6 tables to lay out their food on, and one day 3 of the tables were all fruit. There just wasn't enough selection. My husband is basically a garbage disposal for food, being a weight-lifter, and he struggled to eat. My daughter ate spaghetti and pizza all week. And I was hungry most of the time. The chef is a very nice man and 2 days before we left my husband pulled him aside and asked if they have any shrimp, he cooked us a huge bowl which was nice, but I feel we shouldn't have to ask for the good food. We also noticed the next morning someone asked him for bacon and got it brought to the table. They don't have it out for everyone as part of the breakfast buffet. Basically, you have to ask for the things you are used to or you will be living off pasta, cactus, pizza, fruit, salad, and casserole all week. Gym: THERE IS NO GYM, at all! You have to go to downtown Playa and use the city gym. They will not let you go next door to their sister property and use the gym at Royal Hideaway. We snuck over anyway and used their nice gym. Beach and Pools: As always the beach is awesome in this part of Playa. And the 2 pools were large enough. The chairs on the beach need some replacements, the mesh is stretched so bad that you will be laying on the plastic support bars. If you are comparing this resort based on kids clubs in area, spend your money at the GALA. The only way we would ever stay here again is if we got a super rate, like less than $75 per night, because truly that is all it is worth.

The pools were clean, well maintained and the entertainment staff were great. We went to Jamaica last year and the staff were juvenile and irritating. However, this staff was friendly, helpful and their daily fun was much more enjoyable. We loved the nightly shows, especially the Mayan show.

I am a freelance travel writer, so we travel a great deal, and the Playacar is a great deal if ever I saw one! After reading the reviews to select the hotel, I, as you will, saw mostly excellent ones, and some bad ones. I will try to be as helpful as possible and address most major issues. This was our 10th trip to the Cancun area, but the first to this resort. Since we rented a car prior to arrival, the shuttle picked us up at the airport, and within a few minutes, we were on our way. The Playacar is about 40 minutes south of the Cancun airport. When the speed limit sign indicates 110, just remember, is not miles per hour, it is kilometers per hour! (About 68 mph). We enjoyed the drive, seeing the growth that is extending south of Cancun along highway 307. The Allegro Playacar Resort is about a mile south of the city of Playa Del Carmen. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were welcomed by smiling employees everywhere we looked. We entered the beautiful marble lobby, were checked in rapidly by the very friendly staff, (never heard a rude remark, nor saw an unhelpful person the entire week, as other reviews have said), were given nice cold welcome drinks, and by that time, a bellboy had our bags and we were off to the room. The Playacar is one of the first resorts in this area, and for us, that was a major plus. This has given the resort time to develop spectacular landscaping. You walk winding paths, mostly shaded by beautiful trees, as you travel within the resort. The buildings are only 2-story, with 4 rooms on each floor, so you feel as though you have your own little cottage. Ours was downstairs with a patio, table, 2 chairs, and a large hammock that had my name on it! Knowing that many hotels in this part of the world have very firm beds, I asked for one of the foam pads. The maid made up the bed for us with it, and though still a little firm, we slept great. Other reviews said the A/C was not good, but we set ours only at medium, and it was so cool that we had the luxury of burrowing under the blankets-hence, sleeping was heaven! Bugs were mentioned in other reviews. In a week, I saw a total of 2 small flying ones...1 of which met his demise due to my swift hands! Never saw a single ant in the room, but neither did we leave food and drink around. There is space for both hanging your clothes and shelving, not huge, but more than ample. You are on vacation, not attending a seminar, lighten up! One thing I did not see on the other reviews, but our room had a hand-held shower massage. Needless to say, my wife was a happy camper. Food was very good and plentiful. The buffets had a good variety, and items were usually replaced with a new tray even before the older one was empty. On Thursday, (Thanksgiving), the hotel even had a \"Thanksgiving Corner\", with turkey, dressing, and mashed potatoes and gravy for the Americans. On the day of our arrival, we made reservations for both the Italian and the Mexican restaurants with no problem, and the hotel was full. There are various seatings, so I am not sure why some people said there was so much problem getting reservations. The food, atmosphere, and service at the air conditioned Italian restaurant were superb. The Mexican restaurant is more relaxed, but everything, music, food, service, was still great. Pools, beach, and bars were all wonderful. We got up, never had a problem getting a palapa, though you probably could not find one after 9-10. Drinks were good, strong as you want. I would agree with other reviews, be sure and bring an insulated mug. Your drinks will stay cold in the heat, and you don't have to get out of that comfortable chair as often. There is beach service, so you can stay all day if you wish and still have cold drinks. We have stayed at many resorts, and this is among the first with beach service. We came without children, so I have no personal experience with that area, but they had many activities for them, and the kids seemed to have a blast. Every night there are also shows for the whole family, and the ones we saw were good. They work hard on them, and you should see some while there. A couple of nights there were people there with their handicrafts. Great selection, with some very talented people! As you walk out the front of the resort, about a 5 minute walk to the left takes you to a small shopping mall. It may have some new stores now thanks to my wife. Maybe a mile to the right, is the town of Playa Del Carmen. Whether you walk, ride a bike, take a taxi, or have a car, make the trip. Walk the length of 5th avenue there, and some of the side streets and you may see a movie star, as we did! A sleepy little town that you will love if you look for the beauty of it. Life is too short to look for the negative in it. Would we return? In a second.

We have stayed at the following properties in Playacar: Riu Palace (2), The Gala, The Reef Club and now Allegro. So we have stayed at the nicest and also a few budgets and I am comparing this as a budget hotel and using The Reef Club as comparison however I do think the Allegro is one star highter than The Reef. The grounds are beautiful and well kept the lobby was typical the guy checking us in was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are what you would expect from a budget hotel very old Holiday Inn like but we thoroughly enjoyed the hammocks on the porch we thought this to be the best feature of the room. The beach heaven, pools beautiful and the swim up bar great with great friendly service ( for smokers this is a non smoking swim up bar). Food: breakfast typical, lunch the burgers were the best we have every had and dinner (big sigh) it was ok typical of a budget one beef selection, one fish selection and pasta so you were covered but picky eaters it would be a little difficult. This is where reservation restaurant's are important more later. Now here is my real gripe about the buffet I have never stayed anywhere in 11 trips that you had to wait in line for the buffet and they would keep you waiting with a room full of tables. I found this to be ridiculous and then you had to wait on somone to serve you drinks and you would be half way through your meal before you could even wave someone down. Part of this was due to being understaffed. Now having stayed at budget hotels we have always used the reservation restaurant for dinner because the food is usually better but getting reservations here was a nightmare when we checked in we went straight to guest services to make a reservation he said sorry come back when you have a room number and he would be back at 9:00 the next morning. So first thing we went to make reservations well guess what they were all booked up and he told me the Italian restaurant didn't allow kids so I firmly stated we wanted reservations and he magically found some in the Mexican restaurant (by the way there was a whole 20 pople in there that night) but the food was outstanding. So the next night we go check the buffett to see if we wanted to eat or not but it was so hot in there we couldn't stay I can't imagine what this would be like in August. As we were leaving I looked in the Italian restaurant and low and behold there is a room full o fkids I march right back down to Guest Service to speak with Peter again and he says no I told you kids were allowed from 6/6:30 well no he didn't and my friend who was with me said no you didn't and he just turned around and went back to looking at his computer never acknowledging us again!! So back to PDC for dinner which was very good and not expensive but just irritating that the hotel lied to us but I think they have a history with avoiding the truth. There are some great things about this hotel but the dinner is a real negative and other than the pool bar staff, The Mexican Restaurant and the lady who runs the kids club the staff is just not friendly. If I won a trip I would stay here again but if I am paying and looking for a budget trip I would go with The Reef Club where at least you can eat at the Reservation Restaurant every night. Also for the first time we had something stolen my daughters purse was taken from the room I went to guest services (Peter again and this before the Italaian Restaurant thing) and asked if a purse had been turned in (I didn't want to start out accusing someone of stealing) he said no and turned back to his computer and that was the end of the conversation. Luckly there wasn't anything of value in this purse but had it been mine (which is why I keep it locked up) I would have wanted him to be a little more conerned that there was a theif around!! We tipped everyone for good service and felt it was appreciated. I was disappointed because the grounds and pool are beautiful but I don't want to have to go in to town and eat every night!!", "Date": "November 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitby, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAmazing place\u201d", "Author": "staceymck", "ReviewID": "UR2835945", "Content": "Well I'm a bit late with my review- but I travel every year... and in March of 2002 I stayed at the Allegro Playacar...

Let me preface this review with the fact that we have been to this area of Mexico many times. I have stayed at Iberostar Cozumel, Reef Club Cozumel, Barcelo Maya Beach, and Riu Cancun. I know what to expect in Mexico. The good points are: Drinks are good quality. Bar staff is always nice and willing to get you a drink. Food was pretty good everywhere in the resort. I will agree that sometimes it is bland and the selection is not always great, but the food tastes good and fresh. I have been to other resorts where everything has a funny taste, and this was not the case here. The italian restaurant was the best food I have ever had at an all-inclusive resort. The grounds were beautiful. All of the foliage was kept neatly trimmed and all of the plants were healthy. I was really amazed at how big some of the ficus trees were. The overall cleanliness of the place was great. The beach was clean and all of the chairs were lined up at the end of the day to prepare for the next day. The exteriors of the buildings were maintained well, all of the common areas were clean. The restaurants were clean. Even the little Pizza hut was immaculate. There were always people patrolling everywhere cleaning up used glasses, trash, etc. The only gripe I have about cleanliness was the lobby bathrooms were left neglected at times... The service everywhere was excellent. The housekeeping staff was great, the waiters attentive, and I already mentioned that the bar staff was awesome. With very few exceptions, the staff was great and always willing to please. The negatives: The beds are hard. Like I said before, I have stayed in Mexico several times, and the beds are always hard. But the beds here are harder! If you stay here, it might be a good idea to bring an inflatable mattress to stick under the sheets. The rooms are musty. Bring a plug in. I read to bring one on this site, but I forgot, and our room did stink a little. I think this is especially true in the upstairs units becuase they are thatched roofs and not airtight at all. There are ants in some of the rooms. I read about that, and I thought the people that had ants probably weren't taking care to rinse their glasses or were bringing food into the room. We took extra care and still had ants. I bought some spray in town, but then I had dead ants everywhere. Our friends were in two rooms and they didn't have ants in either. So I guess it is the luck of the draw on that. Staff is only following the rules, but the rules at this place stink! You cannot enter the sports bar until 6pm, even if to just turn on the TV. We were there during the playoffs, and they wouldn't let us go in until 6pm. You can't get the game anywhere else or we would have gladly gone there. I am personally not a sports fan, but many people are, and they should accomodate accordingly. Another gripe I have about the rules- we went to Cozumel for the day, and I wanted to view the Grand Cozumel by Occidental for the next time we go to Mexico. I talked to the manager and he told me to get a day pass to the Allegro Cozumel and that they would tell me how to tour the Grand. We got over there and they explained that the Grand was a category higher than the Allegro, so we were not allowed to even go over there. Never mind that we paid 150.00 more to stay at the Allegro playacar than the Grand Cozumel for the week. I just felt like they treated us like riff-raff, which is unacceptable. Based on this alone I am reluctant to ever stay at an Occidental resort again. OVERALL- We had a great time! Great fun with great friends! Even though I was unhappy with some stuff, I tried not to sweat it at the time. I just wanted to pass this along. The bottom line is that every place has its pros and cons. But if you make a choice, just go with it and have a great time. Afterall, you will be in Mexico!!!!! Sorry this was a little long!!!!!

The area has changed a lot in 10 years. It's much more touristy now, which is a shame, but it was inevitable. Allegro Playacar is a beautiful resort, and it seemed well maintained. The rooms were pretty nice, but they were a little small, as others have also mentioned. The staff was very nice, and they seem to try very hard to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. The beach was great, but it seemed a little crowded at times. When we were there in 1994 we felt like we were the only ones on the beach. The food at Allegro was not that great. They offer a wide variety of choices, but it was rather bland. Breakfast seemed to be the best. We usually had lunch at the snack bar by the pool or outside the resort. The two \u201crestaurants\u201d they have (The Mexican, The Italian) were ok, but not great either. The Italian was the better of the two. The nightly entertainment was fair. Some nights were better than others. It\u2019s mostly made up of different dance styles, which were pretty good. The entertainers work very hard. One night they had a Mr. Allegro contest, which was strictly audience participation with no other entertainers. It must have been there night off. Be prepared to take side trips when you get there. You can do things on your own, but it\u2019s a bit easier and probably safer to book them. You can visit several different Mayan ruins, snorkel, scuba dive, horseback ride, dinner cruises, etc. They can cost anywhere from $45 per person up to $100 per person. Golf is quite expensive. I think it was $108 for 18 holes. The ferry over to Cozumel will cost you $16 to $18 roundtrip per person. Shopping can be an experience. The little shopping area near the Allegro is pretty expensive compared to downtown Playa del Carmen. The shopkeepers will drive you a little crazy after a while to get you in their stores, but they will bargain. Playa del Carmen is a bout a 25 minute walk from Allegro or a $5 cab ride. We will probably go back to the Riviera Maya, but we would probably try a different resort just to see something different.

I saw a price for the Occidental Allegro Playacar. Leaving from Cleveland in mid October for 7 days\u2026. air, hotel, transfers and taxes included, totaled $650.00 pp. Who could turn that down? My husband could not get off work but didn\u2019t object if I found a friend to go with me. Wasn\u2019t too hard to do that! My friend Audrey agreed to accompany me and we were off! Spent the night of Oct. 22 in Cleveland Sheraton Airport and flew the Funjet charter Transmeridian Airlines on October 23rd at 9 a.m. Great flight! Landed in Cancun on time, unfortunately though, to a torrential downpour\u2026I had never seen it rain in Cancun much less flood the streets! Cars were stalled outside of Playa del Carmen\u2026it was a mess. Needless to say, we arrived at the Allegro under less than pleasant conditions. The week ahead would prove to be much more pleasant! I am definitely a 5 star \u201cbrat\u201d having stayed at Iberostar Quetzal, IB* Paraiso (2 times), and the Bahia Principe Akumal. The only 4 star we have stayed at was the Riu Tequila. Trip reports were very mixed concerning the Allegro but we went with an open mind\u2026after all, how bad can it be for less that $100.00 a day\u2026can barely stay in a decent hotel room in the States for that amount much less air fare, food and drinks included. I did email a room request for 2nd floor and close to the beach as possible. Boy, were we ever Blessed\u2026.as far as I\u2019m concerned, it was the best room in the resort (2715) ..other than the Villas that were part of the Vacation Club (time share~). Our patio was larger than most balconies\u2026complete with table, chairs and hammock\u2026and not to mention a gorgeous 5 star view of the ocean! The room is definitely on the small side\u2026I would not recommend more than 2 to a room here. There is a coffee maker, ironing board/iron, and safe. There are only a few shelves for clothing. I mostly lived out of my suitcase which was fine for me. The beds are definitely hard and so are the pillows. However, after a full day of sun, sand and surf, I managed a good night\u2019s sleep. The food was outstanding. We never had a bad meal. The selection is not as extensive as you get at the bigger resorts, but you never go hungry. Breakfast was just OK in my opinion\u2026there was no bacon. However, we did find out later from the Chef that all you had to do is ask your waiter and it would be served to you. Lunch at the pool was wonderful. They have a great selection of pizza\u2026pepperoni and green pepper, chicken, ham and pineapple, plain cheese\u2026.I\u2019m sure there are more! You can order hamburgers, hot dogs and fries too. Lots of great salads\u2026and the best cooked carrots I have ever tasted. I\u2019m not a big veggie fan, but these carrots tasted like butter! They have great grilled fish, lots of chips, salsa and guacamole. They did not have ice cream, though, and I did miss that. The buffets in the evening were wonderful. Monday night is the Mexican theme night. They have tables set up outside the theatre area that are all decorated in the Mexican colors with banners and flags overhead. There are tables and tables of food\u2026.salads, grilled beef and pork, tacos, \u2026so much food that night I can\u2019t even remember. This was a wonderful evening\u2026a great touch having it outdoors with a party atmosphere. The Mexican show was also going on at the same time which made the dinner even more special. Another evening, they had International night. The buffet area was set up very formal, with white slip covers over the chairs, white table cloths with black accents and white drapes over the ceiling. I felt underdressed wearing shorts that evening. They definitely try harder being rated a \u201c4\u201d! We had some wonderful roast pork, prime rib and chicken in the buffet for dinner. Plenty of potatoes, rice and vegetables were also served. We also ate at the 2 specialty restaurants there\u2026the Mexican and Italian. Both were very good. Several nights during the week they do have vendors selling jewelry, etc. along the walkways. Also, there was someone painting ceramic tiles\u2026had to buy one of these masterpieces for only $10.00. There are 2 pools\u2026an activity pool and quiet pool. The activities going on were the same as at the 5 star resorts\u2026volleyball, salsa dancing, aerobics, etc. Very upbeat activities team! They also had Spanish lessons and the Chef even had a cooking demonstration every day at 1:00. We both enjoyed the drinks offered, however, I am not a big drinker and probably am not a fair judge in this department. I had pina coladas and Corecaminos (tasted like a pina colada with some amaretto added\u2026yummmm!) Audrey liked the Jamaican Surprise\u2026.don\u2019t ask me\u2026something with rum that she thought was good! In my research before I left, I read that they do not have straws at the pool/beach\u2026.I need them for my infamous Wal Mart mug! So, I brought along straws\u2026helps to know that in advance! THE BEACH\u2026well, it probably can be my most critical area in judging the resort. It is the smallest beach, I think, in Playacar. Very narrow and crowded. They sure could use more palapas for shade. The chaises are pretty close together. Since I am an early riser, I would go to the beach by 7 a.m and get our favorite spot\u2026sort of move the chaises so that we could have a little more privacy. I can think of worse jobs than watching the sunrise on a lounge chair in the Caribbean every morning! They actually had beach service in the afternoons\u2026a nice touch that I wasn\u2019t expecting! And, of course, the usual non motorized water sports were included. THE GROUNDS\u2026 just lovely. They are constantly working hard keeping things weeded and watered. Beautiful plants and flowers are to be seen everywhere. The lobby is on the small side and certainly not as opulent as the larger resorts. There is a bar on the second floor of the lobby just outside the buffet. There is an internet room just outside the lobby\u2026extremely hot in there with little ventilation. I usually like to email home once a day when I am on vacation\u2026.could not get myself to sit in there! I used the phone at the Playacar Plaza instead! To be fair, however, we did run into several folks who had problems with their air conditioning and lack of electricity in their rooms! I could not imagine staying in a room that you could not count on the electric working. They eventually got the problem fixed but it is a headache having to deal with it. The resort just finished undergoing a major renovation\u2026too bad all these problems could not have been fixed. There were also people there pitching the time share but we just politely said \u201cno\u201d. I feel we received a tremendous value for our money.

We had a great time. The food was OK. I think our problem was we are picky eaters, and there wasn't much for us to eat. They did have a snack bar from 12-4 that served hamburgers w/ fries, hotdogs, etc. The tortilla chips were extemely hard. They have a pizza bar that is open at different times during the day. Some examples of the food they had at the buffet were green pepper soup, fried bananas, oysters in some kind of concoction. You could make a sandwich with pickle loaf, and they had refried beans at every meal. We were able to find some food to stay alive. The drinks were great. We never had a watered down drink, and if you wanted more alcohol then they would add it. The tea was horrible. We drank Pepsi and water the whole time. The staff is nice and eager to help you. We never ran into a time share person. When we were on the bus going to our resort from the airport the lady told us to beware of them. This obviously isn't just a problem at the Allegro. The beds were very hard, and the shower didn't have a curtain. It had a piece of glass covering the front part of the tub. The premises were very clean. They keep the beach clean also. Someone is always cleaning. The major problem we had was people going down really early and putting their towels on chairs under the huts and never coming to the beach until the afternoon, if even then. The hotel had plenty of chairs, but it was these people who were causing a problem. So, on the second and third day we moved their stuff. If we watched a chair that was vacant for 4-5 hours then they obviously weren't using it. When they came for their towel we would give it to them, but we weren't getting up. They found somewhere else to sit. They may have been pissed but tough. They should not do that out of respect for the other guests. Be prepared to see lots of boobs at the pools and on the beach. There is a disco club on the premises called Fast Eddies. They have pool tables, but there isn't a lot happening there. If you are wanting to party then Playa is not the place. It's really for people wanting to relax. We went into town 2 days. We ate at Senor Frogs. Don't waste your money. I have been in several of these, and this is the deadest place. We did eat at a Mexican place called Karen's. It was fabulous and reasonable. They cooked my husband's steak at our table. Overall, we had a relaxing and fun time. I would stay there again. The thing that you have to remember when you are there is that: it is not America and things are done differently.

The following are the 3 reasons we will not return: #1 - High Pressure Time Share Sales (they called our room twice at 8am to tell us it's very important that we report to guest services) We're on vacation and do not want to be awoken by staff trying to sell timeshares. #2 - The EXTREMELY hard beds. Beds have no box spring, they're directly on a concrete slab. I'd recommend sleeping in a beach chair! #3 - Lack of pool side beach chairs. (maybe they're in the rooms?)

The rooms are clean and on the small side, but we were only in our rooms to sleep. The staff puts on a beautiful show every night at 10:00, please make sure not to miss them. The show is totally different every night. We ate at both the Italian and Mexican restaurant, both were good. Although we liked the Italian restaurant best. The only downside we came across was the relaxation pool. According to the rules--No jumping or diving into the pool. But there were too many kids running, jumping, diving and screaming for this area to be referred to as a relaxation pool. Try the beach we found that much more peaceful.

Arrival was uneventfully, and easy. The reception was cordial and prompt but including some threats of loosing the towel cards with a charge of 50.00 usd or the vault key of 100.00 usd. I guess they do that in order for you not to loose them. ( I guess a piece of plastic is worth 50.00 usd and key for a vault lock is worth 100.00 usd) The rooms where clean with normal amenities a TV with a few channels, a vault not very well anchor, and very unsafe shower with a half tub glass as curtain shower and a slippery tub with no safety handles. An A/C that barely works. One thing that is very well kept is the gardens; they are beautifully trim and well kept. The pools are nice and big, not very clean but nice. The Beach is nice and clean and the palapas and lounge chairs are nice. One thing that is vast is the food; there is plenty to choose from. Drinks. Well! They have a limited (2) kinds of bear and coke or diet coke forget it \u2013 it is Pepsi; so if you like Pepsi with rum this is your place, otherwise sorry! On the liquor, I reserve my comments, not the best quality or what you are accustomed at home. One major complain is the service. The guest service doesn\u2019t exist on the beach or pool area and very limited on the general restaurants. The bars are very well attended but you must go to them to obtain anything. There is no waiters at the pool or beach areas, if you need something you must go to them. I guess I should say that the service is good providing you do their way no the customer way. Let me give a couple examples on this, I like to get up early in the mornings and walk on the beach take a few morning pictures and have a cup of coffee. It was obvious that several dozen folks have the same idea, but guess what - there is no coffee till 8 to 8:30 in the morning, get my point? Other example if you like to have coffee with breakfast in the main restaurant, if you are lucky a waiter that attends more than a dozen tables might bring it to you, otherwise you need to get up and serve your self, water juice, and coffee, so I guess if you are expecting a vacation where you pay for service this is not the place. So in summary I will rate this place a 3 star and not a 4 because of the very limited service. Some of the charges are like they feel they are 5 star, a 10 minute phone call to Cancun they charge 17.00 usd, and a national bottle of wine at 34.00 usd. And not to mention the constant hotel time-share selling. We where there at the time the hurricane Ivan was passing thru, lucky for us didn\u2019t hit the Mexican Caribbean area, even though the hotel was preparing for the worst by picking everything up and locking everything and stores near where boarding the windows etc. the Hotel didn\u2019t mention a word not even a posting message \u2013 nothing! We ask and the answer was \u201cnot to worry\u201d gladly we where watching CNN and could see where the storm was heading, but there it is totally deplorable and it shows the lack of customer support the hotel has. They should immediately print a bulleting and place it on each room indicating the possible procedures in case of an emergency. The hotel it is run so cheaply, and for sure it is not a customer driven hotel. They should hire some one and do customer workshops, I guess if they care to compete. Should I go back again to this place \u2013 well the answer is NO.

My 12 year didn't seem to mind, I, however, found it a bit annonying. The food isn't bad at all. The buffet has a wide variety of different choices, so you can't go wrong. I found breakfast to be the best meal. Lunch was good by the pool side. You had your choice of burgers, pizza (which is great), hot dog, etc. The best meals were at the Mexican and Italian restaurants. We had no problem scheduling a time for either one. You can only go once to each, but they were worth it. Once you get situated, take a stroll to 5th Avenue it's very nice and great shopping. I took the ferry over to Cozumel one afternoon and it was great. One important thing, Playa Del Carmen is not a place to go if you want to party. At the resort, after the entertainment is over, it's over. They have a small club, which has two pool tables, a small dance floor and a great bar. It's fine, if you go with a group and just want to hang out for a bit, otherwise call it a night. I must say, it's a great place for family to have some R & R. Almost forgot, the birds can get a bit noisy, I noticed if you have a room towards the front of the resort it's much more noticeable. I had a room towards the back and I didn't have a problem.

The evening shows are both professional and entertaining. I agree there isn't a lot to do after about 11pm, but by then most ( especially those with kids) are tired and if you don't have kids then go to fast eddies bar which is open until 2am, or it's 40 pesos or $4 to go into town by taxi.

Another tip if you want to hire a car use the guy in the reception area. He is the cheapest around and the cars are well maintained and modern. If you, can, try a bit of spanish, you will find it works wonders.

We have chosen this property as it was built within a Mayan style and wanted to get away from the normal 5 star bedroom properties. As our trip came nearer and have read all the negative reviews we were on the point of cancelling. But we were pleasantly surprised, the resort is immacculate, the staff are very friendly and running an extra mile for you, and the beach is great and very clean. The Italian Restaurant is excellent (you need to book as soon as possible) and the Mexican Restaurant is good as well. But please note that no shorts and flip-flops are allowed in the Italian Restaurant. The resort was full with families, friends or couples (noneymooners). We had no problems with the weather and it only rained once (heavy downpour for 1 hour). A very good tip as well for you. If you are deciding to go to Cozumel for a day you can use the Allegro over there as well on an all-inclusive basis but you need to get an authorization form from Peter prior to your departure. We stayed at the Allegro/Coumel for 2 hours but found it not that nice & staff were unfriendly. If you are checking-out by 12 noon and have a late flight you can ask for a hospitality room at reception and a time will be booked for you, You can use this room for 30 minutes where you can have a shower and make yourself ready for your long way home and still can make use of the all-inclusive until you depart which is great. The resort is about a 20 minute walk away from Playa del Carmen (you can cycle down there as wel) or in a taxi it is about 10 minutes and cost you 40 Pesos (or $4). As we checked in we stayed in a ground floor room which smellt a bit damp and complained straight away (checked-in about 2.30am in the morning due to flight delays) and were moved the next day to an upstairs room which was much better. The only disadvantage was that the air-conditioning was noisy. Just to warn you as well the birds are waking you up at around 4.30am but it didn't bother us. There is a good mix of nationalities, especially from the US and Canada,Mexico and Europeans. On your first days you might be harrassed on the beach to attend a 90 minute presentation or with cheap tickets to Chichen Itza (please beware it is about time-share). As well when you check into the Allegro you will receive a form saying that you have won a gift. Do not redeem it as it is about time-share. Only redeem it if you are interested in it. Therefore stay away from it. The locaton is great for all the excursions to Tulum, Xel-ha, Cancun, Xcaret, Cozumel, Chichen Itza.

Some people are not happy regardless of where they are or what they are doing. Granted, we are not world travelers, but we have been to enough places to know the difference between good and bad. My husband and I just returned yesterday, July 17th, from our second honeymoon celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary. We could not have enjoyed our experience more. After booking our trip through Expedia in May, I contacted them by phone on two different ocassions in July before we left, and the agents were more than helpful. They contacted the Allegro to reserve specific rooms that I had read about through other reviews. We stayed in the best room in the entire resort--#5703. It is at the very end of the resort beachfront. It was private and a 20 foot walk to the beach. They also contacted Best Tours for us since we did not know how to find them once our flight landed in Cancun. The agent was able to provide pertinent information and we breezed through the airport to our awaiting bus. Look for blue pants and white shirts with blue and red stripes on the sleeves. Upon our departure from Cancun, a Best Day Tours agent escorted us to the correct airport desk for check-in and did not leave our side until she was sure that we were in the right place. My final call was about our short (30 minute) connection time in Houston before boarding our flight to Cancun. This agent contacted Continental Airlines for me and was able to assure us that if we took the shuttle, we would make the flight on time. Needless to say, we did. Once we arrived at the Allegro, we discovered that we were in paradise. The entire staff was friendly and very accommodating. We enjoyed the breakfast and dinner buffets. If you get tired of the food served on the buffet and are willing to wait in short, quick-moving lines, staff is available to make omelettes, pancakes, fruit smoothies, specialized pasta dishes, and specially offered entrees. When we were at the resort, we enjoyed our lunches poolside with a variety of choices from steak and fish to fajitas, hamburgers, and pizza. The Mexican and Italian Restaurants were very good--we made our reservations to each upon check-in. When you go to the Italian Restaurant, make sure that you are very hungry. They served us food and drinks for over two hours! We had reservations for the 9:00 dinner and were able to watch the nightly show (a Las Vegas Extravaganza) from our window seat. Other shows that we saw included a Mexican and Cirque de Soleil--type show. We were a short walk away from the poolside bar and found that an occasional dollar tip made for excellent service. It seemed that many people there chose not to tip at all. These are probably the people who write the negative reviews. I don't know of any other place where you can buy 2, 4, and sometimes even 6 drinks for a dollar. Remember to bring a large insulated mug. The bartender will gladly make your drink in it instead of the small, plastic glass provided by the hotel. We left the housekeeper a dollar each day and requested 4 bottles of water. The water awaited us along with her beautifully created towel sculptures and a perfectly cleaned room. We enjoyed a snorkeling trip through the resort to a beautiful reef . Bring a disposable underwater camera. We had not thought ahead of time about a tip to our tour guide until we saw a small box on the boat that said \"Tips Appreciated\". We were able to find him in the boutique once we returned to our room to get $3.00. We rented a car to drive to Tulum. It was a fascinating place with not only the phenomenal Mayan ruins but also shops and restaurants. I heard that the tour to Chichen Itza was wonderful, but we did not want to be stuck on a bus with a guide from 7:00 am until 7:00 pm. Make sure that, if you do rent a car, you know how to get back to the resort. We ended up driving through Playa del Carmen 3 times before we found our way \"home.\" My husband was driving as crazily as the locals before we got back to the Allegro. Because we were there from July 12th to 17th, it was hot but beautiful and sunny. It rained briefly one afternoon and a couple of very early mornings--I mean 2:00 or 3:00 am. We're from Florida, so the weather was really no different from what we experience throughout the summer months. We took taxis to go into Playa del Carmen for shopping and to take the ferry to Cozumel. All you have to do is walk to the front of the lobby, and a taxi is waiting for you at the door. It was worth the $4.00 ride opposed to a sweltering 20 minute walk. The shopping was overwhelming on our first visit into Playa del Carmen. The store-keepers can be very pushy and aggressive. After pricing some items of interest and trying to deal with the bartering, we came home empty-handed the first night . After that, I decided the best approach was to enter only stores where they were not hawking their goods and demanding that you come into their shop to receive items \"for almost free\". Shopping got much easier after that, and I got wonderful deals on blankets, jewelry, leather, ceramics, and gifts. I shopped in Playa del Carmen, Tulum, and Cozumel and was able to purchase items for comparable prices in each of these places. A little research can go a long way. The rooms at the Allegro are adequate but not luxurious. Yes, the beds are hard, but we were so tired by the time we were ready to go to sleep each night that it didn't matter. As I said before, our experience in PlayaCar could not have been better. I highly recommend this resort for a fun, relaxing vacation.", "Date": "July 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston", "Title": "\u201cgreat resort for the $$$\u201d", "Author": "parrothead1691", "ReviewID": "UR2304189", "Content": "We stayed at the Allegro late May, just before the Memorial holiday. We went with a LARGE group and this property was chosen based on price so as to be affordable for all. With that being said, and with this being my 8th trip to Mexico, I knew what to expect from a 4.5* hotel, and overall was not disappointed. This hotel appears to be somewhat older than others, but is well kept up. The grounds are lovely, the beach is beautiful. I would say the best part of staying at this resort is the staff. Of all the places I have stayed, the Allegro ranked right up there with friendliness of staff and excellent service. The first room we stayed in was fine. I know other reviews have said that they are too small and there is no storage space. The rooms are a little small, but quite adequate. There are no drawers but there are plenty of shelves in the bathroom. We are in a first floor room and I would probably recommend a second floor room as the ceiling is very high and it gives the appearance of the room seeming much larger. However, I have heard complaints from the 2nd floor residents that birds wake them up EARLY in the morning. Now, about the beds. The first room I was in the bed was quite firm but comfortable enough. I know from previous reviews that there are plenty of complaints about the beds. I thought these people were complainers until I switched rooms with someone and slept on a bed that was nothing like the first room and was extremely uncomfortable. Switching from room A to room B was like night and day. While the first room was fine, the second room had hard beds, broken AC, broken ceiling fan, ripped window screen, cracked bathroom mirror. I went to the front desk to at least have them fix the AC and fan, and to my surprise this was taken care of right away. As far as food goes, this was probably the biggest disappointment. I have stayed at many all-inclusives so I know what to expect as far as food goes, but the food here just wasn't all that great. My biggest complaint is the choices of eating places. Breakfast is fine, lunch is more limited but you can get your staples poolside like pizza, burgers and guacamole, but dinner is the worst. There are 3 restaurants but 2 of them are reservations only. The Mexican restaurant only has about 12 tables and the Italian is also small, so we had to eat at the buffet every night. Lots of non-descript items. The drinks were fine, bartenders friendly. The pool bar is fun during the day, but there is also a lovely bar over the lobby that shouldn't be missed. The beach is beautiful. They could use some more lounge chairs though, many of them are broken. The Allegro offers plenty of activities throughout the day with an energetic staff. Our group was kept busy and overall had a great time. My travel agent has always told me that a good rule of thumb for staying in Mexico is to stay at at least a 5* hotel (this is not the same as an American 5* hotel, I've read enough complaints about that!). The Allegro is great for the price, but if you can swing another couple hundred dollars, upgrade to a 5*.

A mesh curtain would have been better. b. the music/dj by the pool was loud going on passed 9pm, and we wanted some peace/quiet. This is an all inclusive place. The buffet food was ok. Breakfast was good, lunch and dinner were bland. You really need to venture out to get good mexican food. However, the drinks were good. Captain Bob's was a great place for dinner, but pricey. If you go, try the coconut shrimp. You're going to have ants in the room, so don't bring any food/drinks back to the room. You may also have geckos, so don't be alarmed if you see one of those, as we did. I agree with other reviewers that the staff was very friendly and helpful. Although they did try to get us to go on a 60 to 90 minute \"tour\" of their resort for a free shirt, beach bag and towel. We didn't do the tour, because we were feeling pressured and didn't understand why they couldn't just have all the info in a book. I asked if they had such a book and they said no.

Some of the other reviews are true in that the food is bland and the beds are hard but the pool and the beach is great and that is where we spent most of our time. We made 4 dives with Barakkuda which is connected to the hotel. They were great, especially Rodrigo, a little disorganized but it is Mexico after all. We had a second floor room that got very cold and the birds chirping in the morning was not a big deal at all. We met a lot of fun people and a great time at the swim up bar one afternoon! We stayed at the Gala last year and it is a little nicer, definitly better food but I think as a whole trip, because of the people we met and activities that we did, we had a much more fun time this trip. Best Day Travelers is a whole other experience. We got hooked up with them through Expedia. They were very unhelpful and downright rude. We had to wait at the airport in the hot sun for about 35 minutes until that had enough people for a full van. It was very inconvienent for us to catch the agent at the hotel to schedule our return trip to the airport.

Now the dining room. Not enough cutlery is laid and you are expected to use your only knife for each course, there seemed to be no organisation to how the buffet was laid out.

I doubt that much thought had gone into that night!!!!! The best meal of the holiday was in the Italian restaraunt. Superb! The entertainment ? The dancers were quite good but there was a trio (I think called chameleon) that does a turn and they seriously need some help, I would have prefered them to have the help out of there. DIABOLICAL would be the only word to use. As for the pool entertainment, well, what can I say?Nothing good about it. The beach. The sand was fine and white, the beach beds were in desperate need of renewing as most were broke, not nearly enough shade and as much as the English don't reserve beds on the beach, it was a case of \"if you can't beat them, join them\" We got fed up of having to listen to the OTT Amercans whether in the dining room, around the pool or on the beach.They like you to know they are there and you can't avoid hearing them.

The location was great - on a beautiful beach and close to Playa Del Carmen. The staff were very friendly and the food was adequate. The poolside buffet and pizzeria were great so you could spend your whole day on the beach. You can walk for an hour down the sandy beach as there are many resorts in the area. Some nearby resorts were nicer but The Allegro offered great value - the beach is the same and the food is probably comparable so unless you want to spend the day in you room the Allegro should be fine. The rooms were adequate. As far as the ants go just make sure you do not leave any open food or unrinsed glasses or plates in your room. We were on the top floor and the A/C worked fine - it was too cold most nights! The birds do start chirping early so you might want to bring earplugs if you plan on sleeping in (we were at the beach before 9am everyday). A good tip is to place a towel on a lounge chair under a palapya before breakfast so you can have some shade when you want it. If we wanted some sun for awhile we just took our towels to another lounger in the sun and left our other stuff under the palapya. There were time share people on the beach but after we said we were not interested on the first day he left us alone for the rest of the week. There is lots to do in the area if you want to. Another tip - bring an insulated cup so you can fill it up at the bar and it will stay cold for a good while. Also, leave a note on your bedside table asking for 2 or 3 bottles of water each day - it comes in handy for drinking, brushing teeth or rinsing cups etc. We left a tip each day and had great service.

Some words of advice that I would have liked to have known. First, do some research about the rooms. Some rooms are better than others (eg, we had a room 10 feet from the beach while other rooms were very far away). Our room number was 5704. It appears that the higher the room number, the closer you are to the beach. So any units with 57xx 56xx or 47xx are good. Also, we stayed in a 1st floor room and it was fine (ac worked). However, the rooms are small and there are no dressers to put your clothes (not a problem for my boyfriend, but a problem for me). Also, we did find some bugs, but they were just a few ants on the sink. Not a huge problem. The beds are hard-so ask for the pad that you can up on the mattress and then it wasn't too bad. Second, tip. I know it's included, but it really seemed like employees of the resort would go out of their way to help you without the tip. Once you tipped, they would be even more considerate. I brought about 25 singles with me. Get the singles before you go. THird, book your reservations to the restaurants the day you get there. They take the reservations very far in advance. Go to both--they were much much better than the buffet at night. As far as food, breakfast was pretty good. For lunch, I thought the poolside restaruant was much better than the buffet. Dinner at the buffet--ok, but kinda bland. Fourth, we rented a jeep for two days to travel to Tulum and Cel-Ha. Definitely the way to go. (Although the driving was quite scary!!) This way, you are on your own time. Both places were musts, but I heard that Coba was really neat, but physically enduring. We also went to Cozumel for the day to go snorkeling. I didn't think the snorkeling was all that good. (Other places in teh Caribbean, such as Caymans, Virgin Islands, Aruba, were much much better). But if you go, we went with a group from Scuba Libre (a dive center in Playa del Carmen) and they were very good. Also, at night, my boyfriend and I went to a bar called the Blue Parrot...go! It was great! Lastly, if you get a good deal to this resort, do it. But if you get a better or comparable deal to another hotel in Playacar (which is a neighborhood of resorts and private homes), go to that one instead. Being in Playacar was great and I wouldn't go to a hotel outside of it. You could walk around the neighborhood and walk (about 20 mins.) to playa del carmen.

A tip to future travelers -- make use of public restrooms as much as possible, even in the hotel complex. I wear contact lenses, so would have appreciated having a stopper for the sink to prevent dropping lenses down the drain. I think that Fast Eddie's disco (?) & bar should be renamed Not-So Fast Eddie's. The purpose of a DJ is to play music that the patrons want to hear and/or dance to, not to play the DJ's favorite music. The music was truly un-danceable, except for the few occasions where we made specific requests to the DJ (hidden in the back room -- for good reason); and then, he mixed the songs so short that you enjoyed about 8 bars of the songs you requested before he switched to something else un-danceable.

I even tried to change to a different hotel, but everything was booked. So we went hoping for the best. The grounds of the Allegro are absolutely beautiful. We felt like we were in paradise. The food was average, not great but certainly not awful. The italian restaurant was outstanding and the mexican restaurant was very good. The drinks are a total farce. I think the liquor bottles are filled with water. We took the advice of other reviews about tipping so that the bartenders and waiters would take better care of you, it made absolutely no difference. Most of the help were extremely nice. The only bad part and the reason why we would not return to this particular resort, was the size of the rooms. There is no place to put your clothes! We lived out of our suitcases for the week. Also, there is a miniscule shower door which allows you to flood the bathroom floor whenever you take a shower. We did not see any bugs, did not hear our neighbors through the walls (it was very quiet), yes, the beds are hard but still very comfortable and did not have any problems booking dinner reservations.

The staff was WONDERFUL - very nice and eager to get to know you. I had a decent base in Spanish, and they loved to chat. The food was good - again, it's about the choices you make. The foods that were more native to the area (taquitos, beans, fish) were GREAT, and they had excellent salsas and sauces. I could have lived on the fruit alone. If you specifically ask for top shelf liquor, you'll get it. Just be clear about what you want (rum punch with the Bacardi Anjeo is wonderful). The beach is amazing and so relaxing - we spent all day there and would cool off in the pool. There were fun activities if you wanted to participate but we pretty much kept to ourselves and stayed in the peace and quiet. Our room was clean and a quick turn with the air conditioner cleaned out all musty smells. With the air on, we couildn't hear anything, but I actually liked the bird sounds, so I would leave it off to listen to the waves and birds. The only noisy thing was a group of midwesterners who were just having a great time on vacation. Who could argue with that? A few hints: 1. If you get outside by about 9 a.m., you can still get a palapa reserved on the beach, no problem. When we were there, there were chairs available all day. 2. Ask for top shelf and you'll get it - the coffee is great with a bit of Kalua in it. 3. Learn a bit of Spainish before you go - everyone appreciated our efforts. 4. If you go into Playa del Carmen, try the Casa del Agua on 5th Ave. and 2nd. Yummy (make a reservation to be out on the patio overlooking the ocean). 5.

That being said I can tell you that travelling in Mexico DOES NOT require anyone to lower their standards if you pick the right hotel. The Allegro is fine but is not a 4 star hotel. Its a 3 star if you compare to the other resorts in PlayaCar development. However, if what you are looking for is a decent room, clean, with no luxury, average food and very nice service , and a fantastic beach, this is the place for you. I think that the hotel could improve the food a little bit, and also the staff working at the reception desk, but other than that, my daughter and I had a very decent and average stay. The rooms are quite small, and the bathroom and closet area are all one with a sink in between. This area really needs some sprucing up but it was always clean. There were ants in the room but I probably brought that on since I had sodas and chips in the room one night. The AC worked fine. The beds and the pillows were really hard for my taste, but the shower had lots of hot water etc. I really disliked the staff at the pool that practically bullied folks in participating in the poolside activities. Folks are there to relax and if they want to participate great---if not, leave them alone. I actually heard one staff member state that if the group that was participating in one activity did not return at 3pm, their open bar privileges would be revoked.......joking or not, that is not way to attract participation. The other staff were really nice though and there was constant cleaning and pruning.

Supposed problems: 1) Beds-- Hard but all of us appreciated them in the end. Very restful and 'clean' feeling. 2) Birds--C'mon, you should pay extra for the birds! 3) Service-- Everyone worked as hard as they could and tried to keep you as happy as they could.

This service (as well as others) was improved with routine (yet small) tipping. 6) Food selection-- have to agree with the naysayers here but its hard to put a finger on why. The food was good enough and plentiful. Not all of it was great and it did get to be repetitious. Don't stay 2 weeks, I agree! Also, I would have loved to have some beers out of a bottle and some upgradeable liquor choices.

We heard so little we really have to question the other reports, but if you have a problem with that sort of thing, stay on the 1st floor. We had no mechanical or technical difficulties whatsoever. What we did like: Pools, beach, seaweed-free waters, spectacular grounds, staff, service, atmosphere, pizza, location, kids activities, water sports, pool guys (but also the option for a 2nd, quieter pool), agoutis, plentiful beach and pool chairs, Playa Del Carmen itself, Playacar shopping plaza (within walking distance), etc, etc., etc. Would love to return to the area, but may not come back at the MOST expensive time of year and may upgrade to a higher ranked property based ONLY on food and beverage choices and quality.

The beds are hard but not as bad as people make them out to be. Our toilet backed up once and it took 3 calls and one trip to the lobby to get it fixed. We were there when the power went out and it wasn't the hotels fault, we asked for candles at the front desk and they were happy to oblige.

The resort is the mirror image of the property in Cozumel which I we stayed at 2 yrs ago. It is NOT a 4 star resort so don't expect the luxury you'd get at the Hideaway or Xcaret. The property consists of 8 unit, 2 story dwellings. I have stayed in both upstairs and downstairs units. The lower levels are a bit more claustrophobic but have better (i.e. working a/c). This time we got a top floor room which while it seemed larger due to the thatched high ceilings, was like sleeping in an oven at night. We had to sleep with the windows and curtains wide open which let in the ocean breezes. But generally not bad. The rooms were clean and I saw no bugs. Yes, the beds are hard - more like a futon then a mattress - but you are so dang tired at night from the beach, you barely notice. I suffer from insomnia while at home and I never woke up at night except for one instance having nothing to do with the accomodations (see below). The hotel has a small stretch of white sand beach and there were always plenty of beach chairs and shade from the palm trees and palapas. However since the beach is considered federal property there are no lifeguards and you swim at your own risk when the water is choppy. The upside is you can walk along the beach endlessly in both directions past the other resorts and homes. The beach was very clean. The color of the water is amazing but I could do without the incessant drone and exhaust smell of all the jet skis drivers who seemed intent and trying to kill each other. We witnessed one particularly nasty crash. At least the swimming area is roped off so you don't get run over by these crazies. There is plenty to do at Playacar (or not). The staff organized beach and pool games, excercise classes including intro yoga, land & water aerobics. They were constantly present from about 10am til 10pm but I often wished they would just shut up and turn off the music and leave us alone for a little bit. The nightly entertainment was generally ok, sometimes funny and would often include audience members. The food consists of one large dining hall buffet with lots of variety, and 2 smaller restaurants, one Mexican one Italian, which require reservations. The restaurants were excellent. In the afternoon they also have a small lunch buffet at the pool area and usually grill something, meat, fish, pork. We found all the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. The grounds were kept immaculately clean, however there was some construction going on in several of the units so I can imagine it was noisy for those folks nearby if they wanted to sleep in. There was an occassional swapy smell but remember you are in the jungle. One night there was a power outage - the whole town blacked out but the hotel still had some areas with auxillary power. The upside was that it was a clear night and the stars were bright and the moon was full. The power remained off from about 7pm til about 1pm. It was clearly NOT a hotel problem but there were still the boorish louts who complained at the front desk as if there was something the hotel could do about it. This outage extended all the way up and down the coast. We made the most of it at the bar where Jorge the bartender lit candles and kept us all very happy. We rented a old VW bug from Alamo at the airport and would venture out a little bit everyday. We filled the tank up once and drove around for a whole week. We visited Tres Rios which while expensive was very interesting to float down the hidden rivers, spent a day at Akumal and Porto Morelos, snorkelled at some off the beaten path beaches. We spent a few nights in Playa, shopping on 5th Ave. Dinner at the Blue Lobster was exceptional. During past trips we visited XelHa, Tulum and Xcaret but steered clear of Cancun. The hotel has bikes which you can use to ride into town or a little plaza only 500 meters from the hotel. There are gift and jewelry shops, a drugstore and internet cafe. All very nice. The biggest problem with the resort has nothing to do with the resort itself but the loud, obnoxius people who made me totally ashamed to say I was from the USA. There was a large contingent of folks from GA, MI & MN and all the rest of us all wished they would have stayed home. There was a large group of teen boys and girls who spent their entire week binge-drinking, vomiting on the beach, fighting, breaking furniture and openly cursing. Since the drinking age is 18, I imagine this was for most of them, their first experience with alcohol. Especially obnoxious was the night when the parents of several \"missing\" teen girls went door to door at 4am, banging on doors, looking for their children, waking up all the residents. As a parent, I think if you are going to allow your child to binge drink all day (these kids were hammered by 12 noon) - don't come looking come looking for them at 4am! I saw numerous instances of these teens being very rude to the wait and barstaff and quite openly making fun of the delightful local workers. It made me cringe to see these Ugly Americans give the rest of us a bad name. My son and I have travelled all over Europe, US, Canada, Central America and the Caribbean and have never seen anything like this. It was a new low in boorish behavior. For you readers from other countries please believe we are not all like these jerks and I apologise for them. All in all - the resort is quite plesant but don't expect luxury.

My gin was actually pored from plastic squeeze bottle...a sight I've never before witnessed. The bottom line. The housekeeping staff was very friendly and helpful. The beach is stunning. The pools and grounds are well maintained. But the property is completely over-rated and over-priced.

We had water running.....not dripping... out of light fixture in the ceiling while using a curling iron in the bathroom barefoot. The rooms stunk like sewer. They found methane gas coming from the floor drain in the bathroom. The problem was not fixed for 2 days after numerous complaints. The smell permeated our clothing, the bed sheets and blankets. We removed the bedding and asked for replacements. The housekeeping staff brought two twin size sheets for our king size bed. We called four times to get the right size sheets, and no one ever showed up with anything that night. We slept the night with no blankets or the proper size sheets. We understand things may go wrong but this got to the point of being ridiculous. We asked to speak to a manager. After waiting half an hour, the manager showed up at the front desk. We felt she, Carmen (the manager in charge), totally ignored us for the next 15 minutes. She was obviously not there to help us, we had enough, we walked out. As we were leaving, she turned around laughing and pointing at us. We found this to be totally unacceptable behavior. We have contacted Occidental Hotels asking them to compensate for our numerous inconveniences. We weren't looking for a gold carpet resort but we didn't expect to be ignored.

They are VERY basic and the beds are literally concrete slabs with a mattress on top. You can also hear everything that is said or done in the room next to you. The cleaning staff stays right on top of things though so the room is never messy or dirty. We would definitely stay there again. The hotel is only a 2-minute taxi ride to 5th Avenue where the shopping is. The taxi ride is only $4 USD so it is worth it. The wait staff at the hotel is also right on top of things. The buffet is the normal place to eat and when you get up to get some more food, your previous plate is gone by the time you return and you are never without a beverage (alcoholic or otherwise). The water served in the resort is fine to drink. Do not drink the tap water in the rooms though. Even the staff tells you to stay away from it.

Got there on 4th, but hotel was full, so we were transferred to Barcelo down south. Barcelo spoiled us, so when we got back, we felt miserable at first (more or less the same felt other people that were transferred like us). First of all, there are some not very nice people at front desk, but most are ok, including manager Alexandro - he is pretty reasonable. Carmen is good (i think she is a supervisor), Elske (from Holland) and some other girl - were good. Hotel is shabby and pretty old, rooms are smelly (ours smelled with chlorine like hell), occasional coacroches in bathroom and little something in wardrobe. We argued with Alexandro and they put us in \"Coral suite\" - it's like an apartment, so I can't really complain, but ordinary rooms are nothing to remember. But most of the trouble is food and drinks. Choice in buffet very limited (we adjusted to it after couple of days), but first impression after Barcelo was awful. Two a-la-carte restaurants - mexican and italian - we got trouble at both - one teenager was completely sick after mexican (diarrea, throwing up, etc), I thought I would be in diarrea crisis once I got to Coba pyramid next day, but I managed to go over it. Same thing after Italian. People at Italian restaurant are nice, but servants in buffet are very annoing - overly friendly. The difference with Barcelo is that you get young (sometimes very ) people there, here are all mid-30/40+ guys - think and you know the difference. They are lazier, more pushy. Their jokes are dumb. You may like it though. Beach is nice, it is the same beach you get all along Playa del Carmen. Drinks are pretty awful, they use some concentrated things. Pinocolada one day made me feel particularly bad - it was just coconut milk from concentrate with ice (i think something was missing - Barcelo pinocolada tasted somewhat richer). Watersports - you have to pay for lesson (again at Barcelo it is included). Equipment is not that great (especially windsurfing). At the same time, it is close to Playa (though you have to take taxi ($4) or walk ~20-30minutes). To get to highway to catch Collectivo you again have to walk ~20+minutes or pay $4 (it goes for all hotels in Playacar). At Barcelo, we just walk 3 minutes to highway. I mention Barcelo as it is not that much more, but at least it is cleaner, food is definitely much much better (no comparison whatsoever). So if it is your priority (you are not planning to go around a lot), consider Barcelo or something of its class. Allegro is at best 3 stars. Show is low-level, again i'm not sure what you are used to. At Barcelo there were good singers (not all of them), but it was higher class.

I can?t believe why anyone would complain while in paradise. We have been to Cancun 2x but after coming here I have no desire to visit Cancun again any time soon. For those of you who haven?t been there yet, Playacar is a gated community where all the All Inclusive resorts are located. There are also beautiful private homes, a nice golf course, Playacar Plaza outdoor open air shopping mall, and Xaman Ha Aviary (very neat 80 pesos) which is all in walking or biking distance. The green and lush tropical vegetation was so beautiful & a wonderful break from our cold gray Minnesota winter.The Allegro Resort was WONDERFUL. I had read some bad reviews & tried to take them with a grain of salt as I know some people are just negative in any situation. The set up of the buildings & rooms are perfect. There are 8 rooms in each building- 4 on top 4 on bottom. You have your own entrance with a patio or balcony with 2 chairs & table & a hammock to lounge. They are private also where you are not staring at your neighbor. We had requested ?primero piso privado? first floor private & got just that. I had read that the top floors were louder and if it rained would get wet, so we stuck with the first floor & that was fine. The day it did rain the Topaz buffet restaurant did leak & was a little slick. Everything is under a thatched roof which is neat. The rooms are functional like most Mexican hotels (unless you are at the Ritz I would guess), beds are hard but you get used to them. The plumbing in Mexico is different so that is why they have the trashcans by the toilet- don?t overload your toilet with paper. (You will also see signs in some restaurants that say this.) I am writing this because we didn?t know even after all the boards I have read. So it is mainly for the first timers FYI.Anyhow- the hotel atmosphere was so easy & comfortable to get around which was nice if you wanted to run back to your room from the beach or pool. It wasn?t a long hike at all. Again the lushness of the gardens with different palms & foliage was beautiful. This is one thing Cancun is lacking as it is more concrete and less vegetation. There are 2 pools, activity & relaxation pool. We stayed at the beach mainly but would just jump into the pool for a refreshing dip when it was really warm. The Caribbean is gorgeous! It is turquoise blue & awesome. It was calm one day but the rest there were lots of nice waves. We were out by 11am usually and had no problem getting a chair but if you want a palapa to sit under, go early.Next topic- FOOD. We ate like pigs- I probably gained 3 lbs! Diet starts tomorrow! Breakfast buffet was the best I think. Fresh fruits of all kinds, pan dulce ? croissants, breads, rolls, etc. Omelets station, smoothie station which I had everyday, bacon, sausage,etc. Good coffee & juices. Lunch we usually ate down by the pools in the snack bar. Also a smaller buffet but it is snacks & hamburgers/fries, misc items to choose but the best was the chips & guacamole. The guac was delicious. I am addicted to that- its all I ate for lunch everyday. Must be a woman thing because other ladies I talked to felt the same! The lunch & dinner buffets were good. Similar food with both- different meats, salads, & it was nice they had a pasta bar to create your own in case you didn?t see anything you liked. Very good vino tinto (red wine) & desserts. My hubby enjoyed the pizza place which was down by the pools also. This is open most of the day and until 1 in the morning if you are hungry. The pizza was quite tasty. So you never go hungry. The 2 speciality restaurants are El Troje- Mex & Caruso-Italian. You can only go to those 1x each per your stay. They are very small but delicious. The Mexican one they greet you at the door with a tequila shot & have certain items to choose from. It is a fun authentic night with mariachi band. We enjoyed it. The Caruso is more intimate & romantic. 4 course meal with items you choose.. Excellent appetizers with cheeses, great wine, & food. The Caruso is ?formal dinnerwear? but John just wore jean & a collar shirt so you don?t have to get all dolled up which we liked too. I wore black capri?s & a nice light sweater type tank. It was no big deal setting up these reservations. Just go to the lobby at 9am and have your days in mind that you want to go to each & then you pick a time. It was nice because at the bars they had a list of many different tropical drinks to try since you can never think of any on you own. I liked the Blue Lagoon & the Correscaminos. They have a drink of the day everyday. One day they had sangria which was so refreshing & another drink the ?coco loco? which was in a coconut & very island like & a fun photo op. The beer at the resort is Corona.You can do almost any type of water sport you want. The kayaks & boogie boards are free. But you can pay to parasail, jet ski, scuba, fish, catamaran sail, etc. Or you can just sit at the beach drinking a cerveza & enjoy the sun. There are some topless women but it is no big deal. Mostly Europeans. Most woman wear 2 piece suit regardless of body type. Nobody really cares. A variety of people visiting French, Italian, Canadians, Germans, American, Chileans. It was nice to see this as you realize what a big world we live in.The animation team is great. They are so energetic & fun. There is always some sort of game if you choose- volleyball, water polo, aerobics, etc. if you are into that. They have a night show at 930pm which is a different theme every night. They will have audience members participate & it is hilarious. Like Mr Allegro or a game show Women vs Men. Or they will have a dancing show.We ventured out and rented a car which was easy (its no big deal) and went down to Tulum which is a must see. There were a ton of people there probably from the cruise ship tours. But the view of the ocean there is gorgeous. It was worth it. Then we went to Oscar & Lalos for lunch where those Corona commercials were filmed. It is so tranquil & peaceful there & just beautiful calm blue water. Went into Playa Del Carmen a few times. You can walk if you like about 25 minutes or take a cab $4 to 5th Ave. 5th Ave is so neat esp at night . It is all open air restaurants, shops, bars, vendors, etc. It is just a wonderful atomoshere to be in. We had dinner one night at the Blue Lobster which was recommended by everyone we ask for the best seafood. It was! John had the lobster & I had shrimp & a bottle of wine. About 100 USD but who cares since we were on vacation & it was a nice evening. Then we checked out the Blue Parrot which is a typical tropical beach bar how you would envision. There are swings at the bar instead of stools & lots of fun. Dance floor on the beach and they play good music. We went to Senor Frogs one night. It is so Americanized but it is a nice bar restaurant that gets rowdy.Ok- this is long enough but here are just few helpful hints & FYI?s.There are lots of the time share sharks around. For those of you who haven?t been there, people will come up & be very friendly ask you about where are you from, etc. just say ?No gracias? & keep moving. We got this in Tulum, on 5th Ave, & a little in the resort but not as bad.Learn the Spanish basics- Hola, Como Estas, Bien, Adios, Por Favor, Gracias. And use it. Make an effort to speak the language. It is really appreciated & fun. Esp at the resort.Bring a small umbrella. It did rain 2 days most of the day & once we were walking & got totally drenched for a mile long. But it still felt nice & warm. Better than snow anyday!Use at least a 15 sunscreen even if you tan easily because the sun is very strong. You will get tan. We got nice tans and even used a 45 one day. (And normally I would never use that.)Get Laura?s (mapchick) maps. They were nice to read before leaving & have on our car rental day. We didn?t walk around town with them as they are big but familiarize yourself ahead of time- it felt like we knew the place before we even arrived.Things are slower here & way more laid back than USA so relax & enjoy. When at the Blue Lobster it was a long evening with the check taking a while to come, but this is how it is so you enjoy the ambiance. There is no rush. That is why you are on vacation.We would definitely go back to the Allegro again. We loved everything about it. Playa is so laid back & relaxing & just a wonderful vacation spot.

Tanya the customer service manager does all this on her own. People have complained about how rude she is. She deals with snobby demanding people day in and day out complaining they can't get what they want. It's not her fault. I found her to be rather pleasant. The main rule in Mexico is to treat them as you would like to be treated. They will do what you ask as long as you speak a tiny bit of their language, smile and treat them as humans not servants. Our maid was the best. We left her anywhere from .50 cents to a dollar a day. She made us little animals out of towels and left them on the bed for us. We were on the second floor and the noise wasn't what I expected. Only once during my stay did I hear our neighbor whistling in the shower but we both had our windows open. Yes, the rooms are small and needed a mini fridge. The mattress was placed on a slab of concrete. The harder the better for me. Bad neck and back. We never had any water problems like others have complained. We did see a gecko in our room one day but we scared him away before I could snap a picture. There were teeny tiny little ants by the coffee machine but that is because of the creamer and sugar they provide. What else can be expected? The hammock outside the room is cool. The air conditioners on the second floor are useless but we are here for the warmth and tropical breeze so it was windows open all the time. We thought the grounds were fantastic. The pool was good. The beach as good as it can get. The food was good. Plenty to always choose from. Even for the finicky. The smoothies in the morning was a nice touch.

The reception staff was not very welcoming, but did handle the business of checking in. Later on however, when I was having difficulty with the tour company that was supposed to provide transpotation back to the airport, they were unsympathetic and unhelpful (charged me $1.00/min for a local call). The grounds are absolutely beautiful and very well maintained. It was wonderful to be surrounded by bouganvilla, oleander, and many other tropical varieties after leaving a cold climate. The rooms are small and very basic, but functional. We stayed on the lower level of one the \"eightplexes\", near one of the swimming pools. There was a slight damp odor in the room, but it wasn't intolerable. After all, this is the tropics! Once the air conditioner dried the air a little, the smell was barely noticeable. I had read about the \"hard\" beds resting on cement platforms, but I actually found them to be quite comfortable and slept well. The housekeeping staff was efficient and did not accept any tips left for them (I gave up after the second day). The main restaurant was average, the service fair, and it grew old pretty fast. However, Avenida 5 in Playa del Carmen is withing walking distance (or a $4 cab ride), so there are a number of alternatives to the buffet. I found that eating breakfast kept me full until dinner, so I didn't partake in the lunch buffet and can't comment. I did see a lot of nachos, burgers, and pizza though! The drinks from the bar (except the upstairs bar) were pretty weak. I'm not a big drinker, but do appreciate a little substance! The beach was just the right size with plenty of chairs. The best feature of this property by far! Finding shade will be difficult unless you stake out a palapa really early (same at the pool). I'm an early riser, and watched people begin staking out territory at around 0600 every day. The music at the activities pool and part of the beach is loud, but not horrible. On several occasions, the activities staff would blast American rap music liberally sprinkled with the \"N\" and \"MF\" words. Since the crowd is quite international, I'm not sure everyone really understood. I'm also not quite sure that the staff understood what they were playing and that it could potentially be offensive.

The gardens, beach, warmth, and friendly atmosphere make you realise how nice life can be, away from a cold and wet January. Read all the reviews we also were a bit sceptical. Returned just today we like to add our own comments. For us it is obvious that your own attitude will make your stay here a pleasant one or not. We never ever had any problem - during our two weeks stay - with the friendly staff, especially in the restaurant. They did their best, and ofcourse, they can't perform miracles (but then...can you?). It's all a matter of give and take. The food (both buffet and Mexican restaurant) was above what we expected from a mass restaurant and the choice was more than diverse. Only the Italian restaurant is average (pretends culinary more to be than it is with its oversized portions): the Italian food in the buffet restaurant is tastier, you should try the pasta's that are made right before your nose! Our room (we had a room downstairs without connecting door) was very silent. It's just a pity that sometimes drunkards (it's all free so some start to drink beers/cocktails from 9 am) want to share their loud daily adventures with the whole resort after midnight. But this says more about the 'classy' people than about the quality of the bugfree, and clean rooms. No problems with the beds at all...but hey...maybe the dutch are a bit Spartanic. There is entertainment day and night (if you want to be entertained), especially the dancegroups are good. For a safe, touristic holiday, this place is very okay. Playa del Carmen is of couse touristic and unfortunately has little to do with Mexico. You'll stumble over the tourists (and their often pathetic behaviour after some tequilla's) and dozens of the same shops with the same boring rubbish. If you're able to bargain, it's easy to get 40-50 percent off the prices (but then again...hey....we're Dutch). But, if you want to see something of the real Mexico, please look for a location more adventurous. If you want to make 'new friends' the all inclusive resorts certainly can be recommended. Most of the guests are dying to get in contact with you, either you like it or not. Keep some distance if you don't want to be matched. Life is what you make of it...so is your holiday.

Plus all Mexican beds ARE hard. ROOMS - All rooms are thatch-roof huts. They have four rooms on the second floor and four rooms on the bottom/main floor. We had a top floor, wore earplugs everynight, had windows opened and a/c on and had no noise problems. Top floor was GREAT. Bathroom/closet was a bit dismal, but how much are you there? FOOD - Buffet got a bit tiresome. You can only eat in the 2 other restaurants once each. We ended up going to the other resorts to visit/eat or go into Playa del Carmen. Town (Playa del Carmen) is only a $4 USD 5-minute cab ride. There are TONS and TONS of excellent restaurants there. Go down 5th Avenue and you will see it all. We had expected more seafood on the buffets. There really wasn't any. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU - You can go and get a day pass to other Allegro Resorts and eat/drink there for the day and use all their facilities ! This is excellent for variety. We went into Cancun (cheap short bus ride from town - $3.60 USD) and saw Cancun and stayed at Caribbean Village for the day. Another day, caught the ferry to Cozumel. Rented brand-new scooters/mopeds for $20 and rode a great scenic 10 km drive to the Allegro Resort Cozumel. This resort has an amazing beach for snorkelling directly from the hotel. There are a few other resorts you can get day passes to. Just ask the Concierge the day before and she will give you a letter. Overall we thought it was great. It is definitely not for someone who is expecting 5-star luxury treatment. But for someone who wants good basic quality, you will be more than happy. Location is EXCELLENT. Viva Azteca resort is on one side and the Royal Hideaway is on the other side. Grounds, pools, beach, bars are all very nice. If you learn to speak a bit of Spanish, then you will find that the staff treat you really, really nice and will go above and beyond for you. We would definitely go back.

The first thing that got me upset was when we got out of our taxi and checked in. This took approx 35 mins and then we had to take our own bags down to our room. I don't usually mind this but my wife and I had got married the week before in New York and we had so much to carry it was un-trrue. The next thing that really upset us was the noise!!! The noise from the building next to us started at 07:45 and went on all day. I made a complaint to the receptionist on the first morning and they said that they were full and couldn't move us. I carried on complaining all week and finaly we were moved two days before leaving. On the second night we had a really great romantic dinner and we decided to go back to our room. My wife was really tired and decided to go to bed. I on the other hand decided to sit out on the terrace and listen to the sea and watch the stars. After sitting here for quite some time in such a fantastic setting I decided to see if I could get a drink and sit of a further 45mins or so. I take a walk to the bar which is about a 2 min walk from my hut, when I get there I find out that the bar is closed so walk back to my hut. When I turn around to walk back I see a man all dressed in white standing about 30-40 feet away from me, I wave and wonder on back top my hut where I sit down on the terrace. I'm sitting there just relaxing when I get approched by this man in the white and askes me questions about who I am and what i'm doing, well of course I told him the obvious as I think it's just the night sercurity guard, which really wasn't a problem. He then walks away and about 15mins later he returns with 3 other men(one of which was an extreamly big guy!) The big guy askes me all the questions again and then askes me to escourt him up to the reception. The questions this person was asking was, How long are you here for? What is the number of your hut? Whats you name? He even used his radio to check with someone at reception who was staying in my hut. Well he asked me to come upto reception which bearing in mind it was about 2am I said no and then he said if I didn't go up to reception with him he would call the police!!! So picture this, your on your honeymoon, relaxing one evening on the terrace of your beach side hut and then you get hasseled by 4 security men who threaten you with the police, what do you do??? Well I went up to reception and they confirmed who I was, what I was doing there and what my hut number was, this took all of an hour and a half!!! By the time I got into bed it nealy 4am. The next morning we were awoke by the banging from the construction site next door at 07:50 and that was it!!!! I went straight up to the reception and demanded to speak to the manager, this was an extreamly rude, unhelpfull and what I would say totally incompetant at her job. Well when we got home I put all this into a complaint to the resort and the group and guess what??? I'm still yet to here from them!! I visited the resort on 11th Nov 2003!!

It was fun to read them and then experience it ourselves. We are people who travel a lot but have only been to one other all inclusive. Sandals Resortin Negril is definitely a five star for couples only. This was more family oriented which worked for us as we had our 18 year old son along. We were at the Allegro from 12/27/03 to 1/03/04. Here's the real scoop as we saw it:1. Yes the beds are hard. We got over it. 2. Yes, the rooms are small but who cares when you have a beautiful beach, bar and pools to spend your days at. 3. Yes, the room smelled a bit musty in the humid climate but a candle helped. 4. We had no problem at all with thin walls. We were on the lower level of a two level unit (3201) away from the pool and it was quiet. We did have to keep the windows and curtains shut and air on at night for privacy since walkways were very close. 5. The Allegro staff was great everywhere we went except the restaurant reservation lady. My husband showed up and she became friendlier. But we were trying to book at the busiest time of the year. My advice is to book right away the next day after you arrive. Even still we could only book the Caruso at 9:30 p.m.! For some reason you have to wait until the next day. Try to book both restaurants. You'll love the change of pace from the buffet and the ambience. 6. The place is gorgeous and everything is well manicured. We loved the grounds. It was a lush evironment, especially when you are from Wisconsin! 7. Beach towel service was done via cards passed out to you on day one. Lose one and it will be $50. We wondered why they had this policy. People still freely left their towels to hold beach chair recliners. There was an in-room safe to store towel cards along with my wallet, passports and so on. 8. The beach was great. Lot's of people but never a problem getting a recliner or hut. You could walk all the way to town. The week we were there it was very windy(20-25 mph) and as a result some watersports were cancelled or hard to do. The trade off was that you could be cooled at the beach during the 85-90 degree daytime temps. Mexicans hassling you on the beach with wares were very minimal. 9. No bugs anywhere. 10. Nightly entertainment was OK. Lots of dancing acts. Fine if you like that kind of thing. Very enthusiastic hardworking entertainers though. New Year's Eve was absolutely incredible!!!!!!!!!! Mayan warriors, fire eaters in the bar, drummers and a spider man guy that did climbs and tricks on the bedsheet suspended from the thatched roof. Extra special buffet. The Mexicans seriously party at New Years and made it a fun, exciting evening. 11.Overall the food was fine with lots of variety. Afterall, it was a buffet. They have a guy making fresh smoothies, omelettes, and eggs depending on the day, and no matter the meal, you'll find something you like. Our son chose the pizza bar and fast food place by the pool quite often. Beware of the salsa. It's HOT, damn hot! They have 3: Greeen sauce, red sauce and the chopped up variety. The guaccamole is not hot, it's very good too. 12. Quite a variety of activities to choose from and the young staff there to liven things up were a lot of fun. Great for kids and adults. Overall we had a great time and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to worry where their next meal or glass of Corona is going to come from!

The hotel is laid out very nicely. Individual buildings spread out amongst a garden area. Each building has 4 rooms down and 4 rooms up. If you are looking for a hotel with a 5 star rating, a fancy lobby and fine dining - this is not it. If you want a nice down home hotel with a great staff - this could be your place. ROOMS -------- The rooms are small but certainly more than adequate. If you get an upper level room, you can enjoy a 25 foot sloped ceiling. This makes the room seem much larger. The lower rooms would be a lot more cramped. TV's had 2-3 English channels including CNN, E!, and another channel. ROOM NOISE --------------- The rooms have a thatched roof. The roof does not go down and make a seal between the rooms. Hence, every noise made in one room is heard loud and clear in the next room. I mean every noise - so if you are going for an active romantic retreat - be aware of this. BEDS ------ The beds are HARD - HARD - HARD. They are made of concrete pedestals with a very hard mattress. We sleep on a \"firm\" mattress at home but were very uncomfortable on these platforms. Our backs are glad to be home. FOOD ------ Two nice restaurants - but - you can only make a reservation for each one ONCE. The buffet was adequate with good quality food, but I do not like to stand on line for each food course. Breakfast was good with fresh eggs, pancakes and French Toast. Always a person making fruit smoothies. The lunch by the pool was without variety. Cheeseburgers were \"hard.\" Pizza bar was good. DRINKS --------- I saw them pour a lot of RUM, GIN and VODKA into the drinks, but after a couple, I was sure that those bottles contained some non-alcoholic alternative. However, the drinks tasted great and never a problem to get as much as you want. WATER -------- Don't drink the water from the faucet, but also, don't buy bottled water. Plenty of drinking water machines with filtered bottled water. Just bring a couple of insulated sport bottles and refill them every day. ENTERTAINMENT ------------------- Very pleasant nightly show. Each show is performed by the staff. Not a top-notch Vegas show, but very well done. The show is outdoors and we never had a problem getting a good seat. BEACH -------- Great - clean - if the hotel is crowded - reserve your beach chairs early (8:30) if you want shade. They say \"no reserved chairs\" but everyone does.

Mild waves to enjoy, and it didn't get too deep too fast. You can buy an inner tube in the gift shop and float on the waves. The pool, at 4.5 ft. was a little too deep for my youngest (and too cold for me), but she still had a great time using an inner tube or arm bands. One downside was that the kids playground was inside the Kids Club--which is essentially a drop-off free babysitting service.

We are vegetarian, and had no problem finding good food choices. Naturally, it isn't gourmet food, but we were satisfied. The shows at night were quite enjoyable. The staff put a lot of heart into the shows, and laughs were guaranteed. Just before the evening show, they did a Kids Mini-Disco where they led the kids thru some songs and dance on stage, and played games (pinata, hot potato, musical chairs). My kids LOVED this, and are still talking about it. We went into town (Playa Del Carmen) to get the girls' hair braided. There is a nice playground in the town square. You can walk to town from the hotel, but it might be too far for wee ones. We enjoyed walking on the small Maya ruins along the way. Don't miss the Aviary! A 10 minute walk from the hotel, to the north. The kids were thrilled to be so close to the exotic tropical birds (we went twice!). Although the hotel has bikes, as expected there were no bikes for little ones, or bike trailers. Definately no helmets. ;) Bikes are supposed to be ridden on the street, not the sidewalk, so it was just as well b/c I think that would be nerve-wracking with kids. The grounds were very pretty and we enjoyed the set up of the low villas versus a glitzy tall tower type of a hotel. We found the staff to be friendly and courteous---I wish I could say the same of some of the guests! Smile! Say por favor and gracias! Yes, the rooms were small, but we really weren't hanging out in our room, y'know? Housekeeping seemed to forget we were a party of four, and sometimes only gave us 2 towels. We did have a couple mosquitoes in the room, which unfortunately, feasted on the kids at night. Tours-a-plenty were available, and easily accessible, but we declined and just chilled for the week. No one badgered us for tours, except on the streets of Playa del Carmen. My husband was slightly disappointed that more guys didn't want to play volleyball, water polo, or soccer. Some days the activity staff had trouble putting together a team, you just never knew if there were going to be sports or not. After reading some of the reviews on the Allegro, I was feeling buyer's remorse and a little nervous about our choice. No regrets!

That is EXACTLY what we got at the OAP. Our check in went very smoothly and quickly. Rosa was very friendly and accomodating when we asked for a \"quiet\" room (we had 2215-away from the pool). The room was always very clean (we tipped a dollar a day) but it was a bit musty (I presume because of the thatched roof) and loud (we could hear our neighbors talking in regular voices clearly). BUT, we were prepared for that and brought along a white noise maker and ran that at night and slept great. We had a problem with our phone and talked with the front desk--within 20 minutes they had a different one installed. The employees were the friendliest we have ever encountered ANYWHERE! It was no problem getting a \"double\" if your drink was weak, The activity staff had boundless energy...going from aerobics to volleyball to beach contests to the nightly entertainment (which I thought was very good 5 out of 7 nights), then they would meet at the disco and dance with the guests and even take them out for a disco tour in Cancun some nights. The thumping \"techno\" music at the activities pool got to me some times, but by moving further down the beach or to the relaxation pool it would diminish to a \"mild\" noise and was bearable. There were little flys 2 out of 7 days. They didn't bite but were just annoying crawling on you. This corresponded with the calmer wind. When the wind picked up..they were gone. I noticed them at the pools and both ends of the beach, so I presume the OAP was not the only resort to have them. The food was good, they varried the buffet a little. It DID get a little old, but we've experienced that everywhere we've stayed that had buffet meals. The speciality restaurants were nice (especially the Italian). Make your reservations as soon as you can for the best choice of times. The rep was available for reservations from 9-11 am and 5-7 pm so it wasn't a problem getting them. We celebrated our ten year anniversary while there, so I talked with the captain of the Italian restaurant about playing a song off a CD I brought along. I gave a small \"tip\" and they played the song at the end of the meal when they brought us a small, lit anniversary cake. About the water...the water in the room is not purified, but we had a water bottle that we filled daily and used that to brush teeth, take pills, etc. The water at the bars & restaurants was purified and water dispensers were located at the pool bar and by the buffet restaurant so that you could re-fill your bottles.

Once I got there, the resort left a lot to be desired. In fact, it was a complete DISASTER!!! The rooms were shabby motel rooms with very very thin walls. I could hear my next door neibhours too clearly for my liking.It was very dark and smelly in there as well. The resort itself was fairly dirty, and poorly designed. Walkways were dirty, service fromt he staff was non-existent. I didnt' even know if there were any Activity personel working at the hotel. The beach was nice, however instead of palm trees they had these thatched mushroom umbrellas. They're fine in general, however these ones were infected with GIant-sized fruit flies, or some such thing, and they were always landing on you, and biting you. Not a single peaceful moment. The resort had a problem with their drinks. Straws it seems are a rare commodity here. NO straws. Anywhere in the hotel. This hotel also doesn't skimp on the amount of ice (probably NOT purified) that they put into the drink, so the ONLY way anyone can drink, is if they use a fork to first toss all the ice out of the glass. Now, I say probably not purified, since we got sick. Not a pleasant experience. Thank god for Immodium. When we were complaining to our Sunquest Rep, a saleperson from the parent company of the hotel (Occidental) walked by, and hearing our complaints, wanted to listen in more in depth. When we told him that this was a very poor 4 star resort, he scoffed and stated that the company (Occidental) doesn't recognize it as anything higher than a 3 star! We then requested a switch over from our rep, as she offered it to us. She actually informed us, that we weren't the first to have thought the Allegro was bad enough to get a transfer out of.

The staff at the front desk was very rude and were unwilling to help with any questions or concerns. The rooms were average, yet very clean and the hammocks outside each room were wonderful. The beds, however were another story. It is simply a mattress as hard as a rock on a concrete slab that comes out from the wall. The grounds were amazing, and the beach was breathtaking. We were easily able to get reservations at both the Italian and Mexican restraunts and the service and food were absolutly spectacular. Most five star restraunts don't provide the level of service that the waitstaff in the Allegro do. The bartenders were also great and a small tip went very far with them, strong drinks, great service. My advice, tip.

(oct 23-26, 2003). I had read a number of mixed review and was a bit concerned. Well, to sum it up, I was very happy with my stay. I personally would rate this hotel a 4(on the mexican scale, not the american) The hotel is large and has lots of 2 story \"8 plexs\". The rooms are a bit small, but they were very clean and everything worked. One nice touch was the hammock just out side your door. I'd rate the room a 3, but then again, I didn't go to mexico to sit in a hotel room. The resteraunts: The buffet was acceptable, not great, but enough variety to keep me happy. The Italian resteraunt was good. The mexican resteraunt was execelent. (But you have to like interior mexican food. Don't expect tex-mex, or americanized food. Mexican food is all about the sauces). The Italian and Mexican resteraunts required reservations, but they were easy to make if you got there early. They also required formal dress, but any long pants worked i.e. jeans and tennis shoes. The drinks: Well, they only have one kind of beer and that got old after 2. The mixed drinks were tasty, but didn't seem to have to much alcohol in them. --Tipping can improve this situation. The staff: They seemed friendly and helpfull. The beach: The beach is fairly large and clean. You could always find a lounge chair. Finding one under shade was a bit tougher. You will also notice that alot of the visitors staying there are from europe. Some of the women don't wear tops. The pools: They have two large pools. They looked clean, but I didn't go in them. The water sports: They had some kayaks and a few sail boats. They also had boogie boards and snorkeling equipment. --Neither one of these was worth much, as the beach is some what protected by Cozumel and there is not much to see snorkeling. Atmosphere: I liked the atmosphere. It was laid back . Everything was generally availiable with out waiting in line (sailboat reservations and dinner reservations were required. --But easy to make.) There was music by the pool. Not to loud and a good mix of different songs. The entertainment in the evenings was fun, just don't expect profesionals.

We kept waiting for as much as a frown but never recieved one. We checked in without any hitch whatsover to our rooms (our party required three) early in the day, even before check in. We were never approached by any timeshare people. They had tables set up but if you didn't go up to check them out they didn't bother you.

We never tipped them as we were on the all inclusive plan, but one of our traveling companions did and every day they had special attention given to their room, such as towels folded into swans and such.

We did have an incident with the dinner reservation system but I'm still inclined to say that we were prepared for the worst when we got there so we probably got more upset than the situation called for.

We found the staff delightful. Tonya was never at her desk to do the dinner reservations so you have to be prepared and make them some other way. There is always a restaurant open that you do not need reservations for so you always are certain of a hot, nutritious meal. The taxi ride into town is only 4 dollars each way or you can walk easily enough if you don't mind the exercise. The beach was prisitne and an absolute joy to swim in and walk on. They even had pizza available until 1 am down by the pool which came in really handy one night when I had the midnight munchies.

I will stick to my $1,200 week long trip and put up with an average room..heck all you do is sleep in it anyway! Don't worry, I'll wave at you when I walk by with a fist full of money and a strong drink while we share the same beach; these resorts are side by side of each other...Go and stay here if you are looking to save money and stay at an AVERAGE place. If you need pampering, go somewhere else...hope this helps.

The rooms both times were very clean(didnt see one insect in my room at all)and maid service very efficient.Air con also worked fine both times. Grounds looked fabulous and were excellently maintained.Both pools were spotlessly clean. Staff around the pool area and beach were very efficient at keeping the areas safe and clean and always nearby to take drink orders.There was never a queue to order drinks. Food overall was average with a fair selection.My favourite meal was breakfast,The Italian restaurant is also definatly worth a visit. The entertainment staff were great fun during the day,providing lots of poolside and beach activities.eg:volleyball,aerobics,and kayak races. Nightly shows in outdoor theatre were average but the hotel could do with a choice of other evening entertainment.However if you want more action visit the town only a five dollar taxi ride away.There will always be a taxi waiting outside the hotel reception. The best attraction of the hotel is the stunning,glorius,white sandy beach where sunbeds and umbrellas were always plentiful.Plus a good variety of watersports. Overall this hotel is an exellent choice for beachlovers and DO NOT be put off by some of the negative reviews as this hotel has just recently been renovated and my main priority being that the rooms were very clean.

So, we changed into our bathing suits (in the lobby restroom) and made our way to the beach. We were able to keep our luggage locked up at the front desk, so we felt safe leaving it there. The first thing I noticed about this hotel is that the people at the front desk are not friendly at all, and are not that eager to help. But we got over it very quickly after we got to the bar and had a drink. The pool bar was always busy, and always had very good service. The only thing that bothered me was the overwhelming amount of bees that swarmed everywhere around the drink dispensers. Once we were able to check in (at 3:30) we went to our room - small, but clean and cozy - and enjoyed the air conditioning for awhile. The rest of our trip was lovely. The only complaints I have are about the unfriendly front desk staff and the restaurant booking process. We were only in Playa for 3 days, and were not able to eat at both of the hotel's restaurants. The Italian restaurant was available on the last night we were there and was amazingly good-awesome food and service. But we weren't able to get a reservation in the Mexican restaurant at all, and it upset us, because every time we walked by it, it was not full at all. But the buffets were good enough.

What an awful experience. We booked and paid for reservations at the Allegro Playacar back in April. It was my husband and I and 3 other couples celebrating one couple's anniversary. My husband and I arrived 2 days earlier than the other 3. When we got to the property, we walked into a lobby full of grumpy looking people - and with good reason. Every single person there - at least 20 - were being \"moved\" due to the fact that they were way overbooked and the few rooms they did have had poor air conditioning. I have worked as a travel agent for 7 years - and I understand the concept of overbooking and \"walking\" guests - but I have NEVER seen it abused to that extent. It's not like the construction just popped up the day before - why book the rooms if you know they are limited? After much grief with an insincere desk staff - I spoke to Eduardo. I explained that we were expecting 3 other couples - and would need them moved to they same property we were being moved to. He assured me this would not be a problem, and gave me money for the taxi transfer. The day that the other couples were to arrive - I walked back to the Allegro - to speak with the desk staff, reassure that the others would be moving to our property, and try to streamline their transfer process. I was told that there was no problem - everything was set. While waiting - I encountered 2 people who were unfortunate enough to have gotten rooms at the Allegro. They were at the front desk - demanding to be moved because the food was terrible and the rooms were disgusting. When the rest of my party arrived - the desk staff seemed very confused as to what they were talking about. Even the people I had spoken to an hour before were acting like they had no idea of what was arranged. Suddenly, Eduardo appeared - I thanked him for arranging the transfer of the others to our property. His response? \"Um - well - we can't move them there. They have no room. \" It appeared that in an hour - the other resort had completely booked up. To avoid any more time taken out of my vacation - I told him that he needed to move all 4 couples to the same resort - which - after much grief, finally happened. We were all transfered to the RIU Playacar - which we THOROUGHLY enjoyed. I will NEVER book an Occidental property again - and plan to advise all people I come in contact with to do the same.

We stayed from August 3-10th, 2003. Before I go into my discussion on the resort facilities, I will admit that we did have a few set-backs our first day. I traveled with a group, and between the 7 of us, we needed 4 rooms. 2 rooms were had easy enough. However, some of us had problems. Check in time is 3 pm, but we had to wait for a room till 5 pm. When we did get the room, we went to it, opened the door, and here was a whole family's belongings! We went back and explained to them that someone was in \"our\" room. They told us to wait, the people must need to check out yet. So we waited a few more hours, went back, and still the stuff was in \"our\" room. I was irritated, but I'd bet that the people who were in that room would be even more irritated to know that we were able to get into their room, with all their belongings! Now, thank goodness for them, we are honest, midwesterners who would never dream of stealing - but this whole scenario could have been very bad for that poor family if circumstances were a bit different! Finally, I did have to go get my Apple Vacation rep. and have her straighten this all out. Based on what I saw, I would not take your chances and book on-line through expedia.com or hotels.com. We saw several couples who were out of luck because they made their reservations on-line and showed up only to find out they did NOT have a reservation! Go through a travel company like Apple, Funjet, or TransGlobal - someone who has a representative on-site at the resort to help you should anything go wrong. The other couple in our party got a room with no air conditioning and had to suffer a night without it. The next day they got the Apple rep and were given a new room. Now, as for the resort, it is wonderful! VERY clean, good food, great drinks, BEAUTIFUL facilities, breathtaking beach . . . . but what made it even better were the people. The people who work here are phenomenal and always willing to help you with a smile on their face. The waitstaff is marvelous. Definitely eat at the Italian restaurant - the food is excellent and the people who work there were great. The buffet is good, but again, the waitstaff is friendly, efficient, and courteous. They love to joke about bringing you a tequila. . . . You say you want water, they say \"ah, yes, more tequila\". We had a great time. The shows at night are a lot of fun, and they always end with a catchy tune - the Allegro song. It is really a cute, and addictive, little song. Enjoy the beach and the pool! And go to town. It is a really cute little town with lots to offer. A few other quick words of advice: 1. Bring some junk food in your carryon luggage. We craved Doritos and Chips Ahoy cookies after about 5 nights of eating food we weren't used to. We took the bikes to a grocery store and bought some, but Mexican Doritos DO NOT taste like ours (spicier and a different cheese), and they don't have chewy Chips Ahoy cookies! 2. Bring lots of small bills. In town, all your change is in pesos. Very few vendors will give you change in US dollars. So unless you plan to spend a lot of $, or want a lot of pesos as souvineers, bring lots of $1, $5 and $10 bills. But I guess my biggest word of advice is have a travel rep available for you in the resort - they get your problems worked out in a snap if you have any (many people I talked to had no problems). And be prepared to have a great time. It is an excellent place to vacation.

All I can say is that I wish we'd had more money in the wedding budget to afford a better hotel than this one. You definately get what you pay for, if not less, than what you pay for. After reading the reviews, I had my fingers crossed that people were exaggerating, unfortunatlely that was not the case. This entire hotel screamed dirty. Its old and it shows. Not filthy, just not as clean as you'd expect. Our room was tiny, the mattress was like a solid rock and the boxspring was replaced with a cement slab. We had a constant trail of ants running through our room to the adjoinging room next door and getting into all our stuff, huge palmetto bugs running up and down the walls, and geckos hanging out on our ceiling. I managed to take a family of ants home in my purse, thanks to a box of cough drops I forgot about. The food was uneventful and repetitive, and the restaurants you make reservations for were great on service, horrible on taste. The only way to get a reservation was to be up at the crack of dawn, which as you can imagine, is impossible for a honeymooning couple. We got there in time once and once only! Those same ants from our room were everywhere and anywhere food was around, so there were ants on our tables, near/on the buffet, etc. It was nauseating. Let's just say I lost weight on this trip, not the usual for an all-inclusive. I was also highly disappointed at the number of topless women at the hotel pool. I specifically called the hotel before booking to ask if that was allowed and was told absolutley not at the pool, only the beach. But without fail, day after day, I was forced to view other women's breasts. Disgusting. I felt bad for any parent who had children there as I'm sure they had some explaining to do. I know European's are used to this, but I am not, nor will I ever be. The activities staff were a bore as well. Not once did we ever feel compelled to join in. We tried watching several of the \"free\" evening shows and they were boring at best. If you buy any of the tours, I suggest skipping the \"All Inclusive\" day trip deals they sell. We lost money on that. They claim that food and activities are included, but you barely had time for food or activities, so we didn't get our money's worth by any means. We would've been better paying a la carte. Also, we were told this was a day's worth of all inclusive benefits, but found out later that only our first stop of the day, Xel-Ha, was included, not the second stop, Tulum, so we ended up spending more money. The only real plus is that most of the staff were extremely nice and attentive, which was great. I would never return to this hotel and recommend you gather up a little more money and upgrade to a better hotel. All of the other hotels on this strip looked more impressive, at least from from the lobby, than this one.

Perhaps Alejandro just didn't want people like this in the hotel - understandable! Beach is absolutely stunning and the separate pools are great for those who want to join in the activities or just relax and have a swim. No need to 'reserve' a sunlounger, there's plenty to go 'round - why emerge bleary eyed at 6:30am and then re-appear hours later to reclaim your spot?!! The lunch buffet is good, lots of variety - although the sight of a man in speedos bending over the salad bar was a little offputting (guys, please cover up a bit before feeding time!) Italian & Mexican restaurants were fantastic and easy to reserve. Food in all restaurants was good, although in the hot weather, not really a priority. Our room was scrupulously clean, with modern, Italian style bathrooom, efficient aircon, balcony and hammock to relax on. We were directly opposite reception, with the stage to the left. The evening shows are very professional and well choreographed - and will be getting much better as I know the guys have a lot of new ideas up their sleeves. The walk into town takes about 20 minutes, but a taxi only costs a couple of quid and it is well worth going out a few times. We went to Blue Parrot, Mambo Cafe, Tutix and a couple of other lovely low-key non touristy places (which shall remain nameless.) The nightlife is there if you want it, with the hotel sports bar more of a meeting point before heading off. I would certainly reccommend this hotel and area to anyone. Quiet, but with plenty to do and the town within easy reach. Be polite to the staff and attempt to speak a bit of Spanish - the majority are very friendly and approachable!

It was a bit smaller than the average room, but we didn't really need much space. The AC worked great! I actually had to turn it down a few times. The food was okay. It's nice to have so many choices. I was disappointed that there were no vegetarian choices at the Mexican restaurant. This was never a problem at the regular buffet though. Bring shoes other than flip-flops if you want to try the Italian restaurant. I brought all kinds of dresses with me, but nothing but sandals to wear with them and the dress code outside the restaurant says no flip-flops.

These reviews were very helpful for us. As soon as we got there, the manager informed us he didn't have ANY rooms available, and he was moving us next door. Expecting this to happen from reading these reviews, we raised a BIG fuss and refused to leave, so he took us into his office. We spent the entire first hour of our vacation arguing with this fellow, Alejandro, who refused to even let us see his resort until we looked next door first. Finally, after I told him if he didn't have a room he better pay for our plane tickets back to the USA, and after I mentioned that if I were really mad I would throw a chair through his glass door, he admitted there was a room \"near the construction,\" but he said there would be loud noises and we would be uncomfortable. We told him we'd take it, but if we absolutely hated it we would be back demanding a better room. Wouldn't you know, it was nowhere near the construction! He lied to us! All of the units near the ocean are under renovation, but we near the hospitality center and lobby - far, far away from construction. Our Amex representative told us we did the right thing to argue with the manager, b/c people who are \"soft\" will get sent to other resorts, and they could be much lower quality, or only have 1 night available. All of this initial trouble was WELL WORTH IT. I must warn you that we were there for the beach, not for the food or the entertainment. The beach is 500% better than the beach at Cancun. No seaweed, no smell, no rocks or shells, and plenty of lounge chairs available in the pure white sand. The water was three beautiful different shades of blue! Wear lots of sunscreen, even if you normally don't burn, and reapply it after you go in the water. Many people got burnt the first day and we never saw them again on the beach! The Allegro is a very clean resort, and the staff (aside from the front desk) is delighted to serve you. A little tip goes a long way, too! There were guests there from Mexico, USA, France, UK, Germany, Italy, and who knows where else? The Mexican restaurant is currently being renovated, so they moved it to the buffet area. No big deal. The construction, even if you do get a room near it, is only during the day from like 9 to 5 or so. Most people are not in their rooms anyway during these hours. Besides, the music at the activity pool and the crashing of the gulf waves drown out the noise. The gardens are well-maintained, and the tropical sounding birds are a delight to hear when you wake up. The food is decent, definitely good enough for a meat and potatoes kind of person, but DON'T EXPECT GOURMET FOOD! The rooms are clean, the A/C is good and cold, the bed is nice and firm, and the TV works, but don't expect much. It is a perfect, quaint little place to crash at night. There is even a hammock to take a nap on outside your room. DO NOT EXPECT a huge, luxurious room! If you want the RITZ, go somewhere else and expect to pay for it! This resort is a quieter resort, mostly for families and more settled couples. This is where you go to relax, not to party. This is NOT the MTV Spring Break type of resort. There is nightly entertainment by the staff, but the resort is pretty darn quiet after the nightly show is over at 10:30. There is a night club, but it is SMALL and it didn't seem like very many guests were using it during the weekdays. The highlight of our stay was the Captain Hook Lobster Cruise in Cancun. It was a little pricey, but well worth it. You can book this with a representative at the Hospitality Center. All of the drinks are included, so get your money's worth! The lobster was delicous. The pirates can really throw a party! My advice, if you are looking at this resort, is to pay for the cheapest run-of-the-house room they have, expect everything to be \"just par,\" be really tough and persistent when they try to send you somewhere else, and once you are done at the front desk, get ready for a great time! You will be pleasantly surprised when you actually get to your little room and relax after a long travel. Proceed to the Aqua Bar near the beach and have a few Coronas (on tap) or Margaritas to calm your nerves after dealing with the front desk!

We walked the beach line and by far our section of the beach and ocean was the best. Other resorts had more beach front, but it was full of chairs and people. The ocean was pristine, NO seaweed, great sand bars and warm, oh so warm. A reminder that the beach is topless-allowed, so there is alot of women walking around in bottoms only. Not exactly a good thing for young boys (or old married ones that could easily be distracted). We went snorkling in Cozumel for the day using a Aquaworld package and had a great time. They offer snorkeling at the hotel too, but I heard the reefs in Cozumel were superior. Anyway they feed us, transported us and entertained us, it was a fun full day out. Recommend either snorkeling or scuba while you are there to truly appreciate God's creations in the ocean. The shops were nice too, a little pushy on 5th avenue, but that is to be expected.

If you are looking for a luxury resort/business style go to somewhere like the Royal hideway resort.We love this resort and hope to come back soon!!", "Date": "May 24, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Occidental Allegro Playacar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d153965-Reviews-Occidental_Allegro_Playacar-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$98 - $349*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Lote Hotelero No 7</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Playacar</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "153965", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cd/f6/cdf6e262b7b7c0d7748706e44650a7062large.jpg"}}
