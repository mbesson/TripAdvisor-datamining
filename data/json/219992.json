This hotel was very clean, the staff was quite friendly and helpful, and it was about 50 yards to a Metro stop.

The towells were plush and kept warm due to the electric towell rack. It is in a quiet, safe neighborhood close to nice shops and restaurants and within walking distance to the Eiffle tower, Rodin museum, Napeleon's tomb and much more. It is also right around the corner from an \"Open Tour\" stop. I really loved this place and cannot imagine finding a better place for the price. Finally, get to know the staff, especially Remy.

After spending probably hours online (and on this site) trying to find the perfect place to stay in Paris, I settled on Hotel de l'Empereur. While it is a \"bit off the beaten path\" it is situated in an absolutely gorgeous part of Paris: next to Les Invalides, a short stroll from some cafes and the busier side of Paris near the Eiffel Tower. There is also a metro stop nearby making this 'walking city' a little more convenient to get around. The price was also very reasonable for Paris and I found it of good value. I arrived super early on a Saturday morning. Room was as expected not ready but was able to lock up the luggage in storage. Off to get a quick breakfast and do some more walking around then! Once I was able to check in, I really feel I lucked out. As a single traveler, I even had a great room on the second floor facing Les Invalides. The room and bathroom are small and tiny but so goes most of the hotels in Paris. For the price I paid I was quite happy though. The room was beautifully decorated; they must have renovated recently. Bathroom was clean and so was the room. Bed was comfy as well. The hotel is also 100% non-smoking which is GREAT for a non-smoker like me. But on a number of occasions, there was a smell of smoke that drifted up the stairwell from the lobby which I could smell in my room. I suspected it was people that actually stepped outside for a smoke and the smell just drifted in the front door, or, there was someone smoking elsewhere in the hotel either in another room or down in the lobby in a backroom or something. . .these were just theories I had but I couldn't find the source ultimately. This wasn't much of a huge issue. I did run into Catherine, the owner of the hotel/manager and mentioned it to her and she did take it quite seriously and after that encounter, never had an issue with the smoke again. Catherine was also most helpful and pleasant; she even helped out in an unfortunate situation as I was stuck with a 500 Euro note (money changer had given me one at my departure point) which is virtually impossible to get rid of in Paris short of going to a bank which, if you don't have an account with they won't break into smaller notes. Fortunately she came to the rescue. She runs a fine establishment and most all her staff is for pleasant and attentive. I would highly recommend this place: it is a quality establishment and has a great location (great restaurant next door). It may be away from some of the major sites but in all actuality you are not far from much in Paris. I look forward to returning one day and wish this hotel continued success.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cSmall but plush rooms, with a stellar location\u201d", "Author": "Amanda F", "ReviewID": "UR126182389", "Content": "We spent three nights at Hotel de l'Empereur in early March, and found the location extremely convenient.

Yes it was a small room - they are ALL small in Paris unless you have big coin! - but exquisitely styled and immaculate. We had a room on a corner of the hotel and pinched ourselves with joy at the beautiful view across the street to the glorious golden dome of Les Invalides. We opened that window to lean out and take in the view several times a day. The hotel itself also had quite a charming frontage adorned with brightly flowering cyclamens. The builtin wardrobe in the room seemed small but was big enough to pack away two suitcases of clothing as well as the cases, so the room wasn't cluttered. There was also a small desk where we had no problems using the wifi. The bathroom was very modern, also with a window (privacy blind) and heated towel rack. The hotel has one of those classic miniature lifts you get in all these old buildings in Europe - tiny but functional. The bed had plenty of pillows but was too soft for my back, and a waterproof liner on the mattress made it a tad sweaty at times. The room was immaculately cleaned each day. It was winter but the heating was excellent. There's no minibar and you aren't allowed to eat in your room (I didn't see this notice until the second or third day but hadn't been \"reported\" by the housekeeping staff for all the chocolate papers they must have found in the bin!) and it does breakfast but not dinner; however there are heaps of brasseries, pizza joints and restaurants in this area and if you walk 2 mins to the other end of the street which the hotel is on the corner of, there is a pretty good kebab shop. There's a small vending machine in reception for soft drinks and water but you're better off visiting one of the nearby supermarkets or convenience stores. The location was wonderful. The seventh is a very relaxed semi-residential area full of classical French apartment buildings. Real estate window shopping showed us you can easily pay a million or more for a decent sized apartment round here, and the shops reflect a comparable quality of life and gourmet tastes. In the evenings it is amazing how many dogs pop out of the apartments with their owners! The hotel is handy enough to metro stops to use these for arrival and departure transport, either pulling a suitcase or carrying a backpack, and for touristy day trips it's also easy walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, the Seine, Batobus stops, Place de la Concorde, and of course Les Invalides is right there. When we made our hotel booking (through a booking site) the hotel responded quickly with some useful tips for tourists, including an airport shuttle which we did book and which was very worthwhile for our arrival trip. The breakfast of 11Euro each is actually very good value (just check the board at any brasserie to compare!). You get a continental buffet - so baguettes, croissants, pain du chocolat, hot coffee, chocolate, tea, ham and cold meats, cheeses, butter and jams, toast, cereal, yoghurt, fresh fruit salad, fruit, and even boiled eggs - plenty to choose from and take your time to fuel up for the day ahead. Staff were pretty friendly - notably the housekeeping, who we ran into once or twice. Front desk staff were mostly very helpful as were the breakfast room staff - we just found it a little odd it is seemingly still ok to smoke in the kitchen, and stray fumes were a little offputting at breakfast.

I understand the other rooms have similar themes. I asked for a single room and as per previous Parisian visits I expected just that, a single bed with a tiny bathroom doubling as a closet. Can you imagine my surprise and bliss to be presented with an enormous king size bed, a huge bathroom and separate hallway and closet. Flat screen TV of big proportions on the wall complete the creature comforts. There are some really nice restaurants in the neighbourhood, most within a short walk. Taxi rank is 50 metres away, so is a metro station. This hotel is beautifully central, museums, Eiffel Tower all within a short walk away. And for all you English speakers out there who complain that Parisians are unfriendly and do not try to communicate in English, the hotel staff are almost all very fluent in English, are very helpful in arranging tours, explaining how the Metro and RER rail systems work etc. I felt so welcome in Paris for the first time ever and it is entirely due to the wonderful staff who tried so hard to please us in every way. The breakfast offered as an \"extra\" was really excellent. Bottomless coffee, juices and almost everything, fresh croissants and French bread from a local bakery - more than enough to last well into the day.

The rooms were on the small side (to be expected) but were obviously recently renovated with beautiful d\u00c3\u00a9cor, lovely, comfortbale bedding and a flat screen tv (although every station by CNN International is in French :)). The bathroom even put American hotel bathrooms to shame with its size, marble floors and walls and a waterfall shower to boot. The rooms were all super clean and tidy as was the hotel lobby. The staff was friendly although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have too much interaction with them other than leaving our key every morning. As an FYI, the breakfast is 11 euro which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize the first day (but quickly did after they asked for our room number!) so just be aware.

Hum, no sink, no fan, no soundproofing-I am sure you understand what I am saying. We made a deal that if someone went into the toilet, the TV went on. The shower which was black marble, a huge rain shower head, big and beautiful was in another area off the bedroom...and no door! Quirky, definitely.

I can tell you the value of the hotel was realized very quickly when you looked at the size of your rooms, the cleanliness of the hotel and the sincere desire to make your trip memorable. The area we stayed was a bit away from some of the major sites but that was not a big deal since you could travel the Metro which was right near the hotel. In fact some of the other areas were somewhat dirty and contained graffiti so we felt more relaxed and at times safer at our hotel. Within a very short distance we found a small grocery store (opened to 10pm) to purchase wine (bottles of wine around 4 euros or less) and cheese (sampled many different varieties with crackers) which we ate as a family every evening in the downstairs dining area. There is no eating in the rooms which at first was a little different but then you quickly realize it is a policy in place to maintain the quaility of the sleeping quarters. No one wants stains on the carpet or other areas of their room. There are also a few small cafe and restaurants within walking distance to eat all of the meals. Can not remember the name of one which was not worth going to (believe it was La Costa or something similiar it had red awnings); had bad food and prices were high, will try to review that later. Walking distance to Napolean's Museum, Effeil Tower and a few other areas but again took the Metro to most places.

We spoke virtually no French, but they were patient with us. We were pleased to find a BNP Paribas Bank located within a couple of blocks of the hotel, as I'd previously learned that it's a part of the Bank of America Global Alliance and would charge no ATM access fees to B of A customers.

It's a newly renovated boutique hotel with Paris' typically tiny rooms and small lift, but the rooms are elegantly furnished (the overall look is one of sumptuousness, with reds and golds, heavy fabrics, luxurious padded headboards, etc) and the bathrooms are big and bright, with wonderful new showers that give you the option of hand-held or 'rainforest' sprays.The area is quiet at night, and there's double-glazing on the windows. Overall, I thought the hotel was excellent value for money. Our double, # 53, was very romantic, with a balcony and a stunning view of the gold dome of Les Invalides. The bed was the size of an American king or queen. There wasn't much space in the room itself for more than the bed-- a small desk, nightstands, and a closet were all that could fit -- but we slept wonderfully well. Our nephews shared a triple, #55, with three separate beds (two of which had been made from a double. The third was a roll-away bed, which, I must say, drew some complaints). Their room was much bigger than ours, with a view of the courtyard. If travelers need extra space, perhaps that line of rooms can be booked as doubles. The location itself is perfect for first-time tourists to Paris. We were there with nephews who'd never been to the city before, and so they wanted to take in all the big-name sites. Hotel de L'Empereur is within quick walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, the Seine cruises, Les Invalides, and the Grand and Petit Palais for art exhibitions. It's a minute from the market street of Rue Cler, 15 minutes from the Musee D'Orsay. It's a three-minute walk from the Metro and from a number of bus stops for lines that go straight into the heart of central Paris. That said, since we were there in August, when Paris really shuts down, we found the neighborhood itself less colorful and lively than, say, the Marais or St. Germaine area. Travelers should also be aware that the hotel is not a five-star property: there are no minibars or kettles in the rooms, the small lift means usually only 2-3 people can go up at once, there's only one computer for public use downstairs (and it always seemed to be occupied), though Wifi is free. The 11 Euro breakfast includes pastries, breads, ham, cheese, yogurt, fruit compote -- and what were supposed to be hard-boiled eggs, but were not! (You can imagine how we discovered this, even after asking). And items were not replenished. When we ate breakfast at 9 a.m., the croissants and bread ran out -- never to be replaced. This was one of the few drawbacks of the hotel. The other is that hotel policy requires guests to leave their key at the front desk, which is manned 24-hours. Once, however, we stood at the reception desk waiting for our key for at least ten minutes while the clerk ( a woman who did not appear to be a regular) spoke on the phone with a potential guest. We're not very picky about service, but her refusal to simply acknowledge that we were waiting struck us as impolite. Otherwise, however, the reception staff was TERRIFIC. We were given an extremely warm welcome and plenty of assistance during our stay. Every time we needed something -- directions, taxi reservations, help with the rooms -- the rest of the staff was friendly, kind, and prompt. We were comfortable at Hotel de l'Empereur, we were well-rested, and we were generally impressed. We would definitely stay there again.

The hotel is set on a quiet street less than 200 meters from the nearest Metro station, La Tour Maubourg, located near to Hotel des Invalides and a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. A small hotel, as the other reviews highlight the hotels room standards in my opinion exceeded the current two star grading. We booked a double room with a street view and were delighted with our fourth floor room which afforded a view of Hotel des Invalides and its golden dome, which when illuminated at night was simply stunning. The room was modern and spotless with a modern showeroom. A hairdryer, flat screenTV and safe was provided. The photographs on the Hotel web site and those provided by fellow travellers accurately depict the rooms. On arrival at the hotel the reception staff were helpful and friendly . A buffet breakfast was available in the hotel that was reasonably priced by Paris standards however we opted to eat in one of the many cafes as we travelled through the city. We flew into Charles De Gaulle and took the train and Metro into the city, cost about 18 euro for the both of us. One tip if you have a Blackberry is to down load the Paris Metro app which worked out the shortest and quickest route detailing the stations to change at and connections. This was really helpful and simplified our travel. The ticket machines are in English and one ticket covered both the airport train (RER) and Metro. We also purchased the museum pass that covered all the main attractions buying this at Hotel des Invalides were the queues were the smallest. The Eiffel tower we went up at 11pm again smaller queues. River cruise also recomended. A thing to watch out for is a gold ring con, we came across this twice easy way to avoid it is if anyone offers you a \"gold ring\" they have \"found\" simply do as we did and walk away.

L'Empereur was 5 euros cheaper, but they are on the same street, similar decor, both quiet, both modern decor, tvs. Actually, I would rate l'Empereur higher than Muguet, because the bedroom and bathroom were bigger, with a rainfall shower, whereas Muguet had a much smaller room and shower. Both had good towels and bedding as well. I can vouch for the air conditioning working well also - it was a record warm temperature for April and the room was cool enough for sleeping. Both are just around the corner from La Tour Mauborg metro station, and also near l'Ecole Militaire station as well. Fun shopping and cafes along Rue Cler as well. my only complaint (and a minor one) is that the shower is one of those that doesn't really have a lip, so the water tends to get on the floor, but that's a very small complaint. (for the record, while la Bellechasse is clearly a notch above these two, it's also 150 euros more a night, and our room only had a hand-held shower). I would save your money and stay here instead.

The view is excellent - worth it for those nights sat with Champagne, or mornings looking out. We we're on the 5th floor and had a small balcony, which doors opened out on too. Perfect to stand and watch the world go by. Room has hairdryer, free safe box, and basic toiletries. The bathroom was spacious with modern fittings, and had a large shower. The beds are large, and very comfortable with extra bedding in wardrobe. We slept extremely well. Heating can be controlled in room with ac, and our room was a good size too (especially for Paris). Wifi is available throughout the hotel for free. You just have to get the password off reception, and get them to set an account up. It was fast, but does require login each time you connect. Reception always helpful. Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that. We preferred to wonder down the road and find a local patisserie or cafe. Lift is small but fits three and a suitcase. Coffee and drinks available in the hotel, and our room was fully cleaned every day. We would definitely stay there again.

The hotel has always been suitable and quite adequate for our needs - quiet and clean and a great location. On this occasion we were travelling with our son and daughter in law and 3 year old grandson. We specifically choose this hotel as we felt it would be better than others we have stayed at because we had a 3 year old with us. Our flights had taken us across Canada and then transatlantic to Paris. The two nights I had booked at this hotel were to allow us to rest prior to carrying on to the south of France. I had booked on line and by telephone in October 2009. When we arrived at the hotel about 10:00 am he woman at the front desk said \" there will be noise from 9 to 12 and 1 to 3, is that okay? Well it wasn't - we had been in transit since 1:00 pm the previous day. We were exhausted from our long flights. We felt we didn't have any choice at that point. The hotel was essentially gutted on all but the top floor and the first floor of rooms. The top floor rooms may all have been finished. Our family's room was on the top floor and it had been redone and was very nice. Their hallway was still in a state of renovations - dusty and looked like work space. The staircase had been stripped of carpet and had not been redone. There didn't appear to be any temporary lighting in the stairwell. At times the construction workers used the elevator to move their equipment. The winch that took construction materials to the upper floors was just outside the window in my room but it didn't really matter as the jack hammers were louder than the noise of the winch. There was major work underway. The woman at the desk identifed herself as the new manager/owner ( she said as of Jan 2010) Later that morning I talked with her - she was completely indifferent - no apologies for the noise nor adjustment to the bill - she just kept repeating that she had told us when we checked in that there would be noise. Perhaps I'm being to naive to suggest that hotel guests should be advised in advance of this type of conditions - or more to the point, I think the hotel should have been closed for the duration of the work. The hotel seemed more like a construction sight with a few rooms than a hotel with \"renovations\" taking place. After checking in I went for a walk to find alternate accommodation in close proximity but stopped after three hotels as there was nothing available - particularly in our price range. On a couple of other points: the bed in our room had a rubber sheet as the mattress cover. It was noisy and hot to sleep on. We took it off. The bill as presented at check out was 5 Euros higher on one room than what was confirmed by email.That felt like insult to injury. This has since been adjusted. I have been to Paris several times and yes - I often think of my hotel room as a providing a place to sleep while I explore the fabulous city during the day. That being said there is always a day or two of adjustment for jet lag or the need for other quiet time when I expect a hotel room to provide respite during the day.

Still, we were able to print our boarding passes and check emails.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cI will stay there again the next time I'm in Paris.\u201d", "Author": "Kvnbnsn", "ReviewID": "UR53086678", "Content": "For starters, Hotel de l'empereur is just minutes away from two different metro stops so we could quickly drag our suitcases there after an all-night flight before walking around the nearby shops & cafes heading toward the nearby Eiffel Tower. Plus, we took the metro every single day so it saved us tons of time and made it easy to stop for a quick nap or bathroom break. Other positives are: It's extremely quiet. The staff speaks enough English to make communication easy. There's a completely affordable breakfast buffet for the times we just needed a quick bite before starting the day. All you can eat cereals, pastries, croissants, coffee, teas, and juices. Plus, it's blocks away from rue Cler, a cute & quaint little street w/ markets, cafes & shops for everyone. Be sure to grab a wonderful breakfast from Cafe du Marche! The only conceivable downside (as noted in many other reviews) is that the room was small. Not uncomfortably small, but just-enough-room-for-everything small. Our room had a full size bed for 2, closet, night stand, small desk, 2 chairs, & a television, as well as a connected bathroom w/ a toilet, sink, bidet & bathtub w/ sprayer attachment. A perfect place to spend unwind after long treks around the city and take a nice bath to relax. If you're one of those people that likes spending entire days kicking it in your hotel room then this might not be the place for you. But if you're looking for a clean, safe, comfortable, close spot to stay while you spend your time enjoying the city of lights, book a room here while you still can. As an added tip: be sure to buy your Paris Visitor Pass for the Metro on Expedia weeks before you go. It will save you tons of money if you plan to see a lot of the city as well as avoiding language barrier problems. Just print up the voucher and follow the directions.

He would have happily turned us out in the street had I not gone to an Internet cafe, tracked down the confirmation e-mail and printed it out. There are other minor issues. The elevator is so small that it struggles to fit both a single person and luggage. The beds feel a bit thin and cheap. It can be a bit noisy if your room overlooks the street (which is why you should ask to overlook the silent courtyard).

Tour Mauberg is also direct on line 8 from Opera if you use the Roissybus from Charles de Gaulle airport. The hotel is clean and refurbished in the last couple of years. Our experience indicates that negative reviews of the past refer to the time before/during the renovations and do not reflect the current situation. Our room (No.14) was a smallish double that had a nice view of the Ecole Militaire. It was clean and smartly furnished with a large shower room. If you need space in your hotel room, or are planning an extended stay, you might describe the room as small, as there was no wardrobe (we kept our suitcase in the large bathroom). The hotel operates 4 levels of variable pricing according to the season, which makes it best value off season. It is in the same street as the Hotel Muguet (see our review Feb 2008), which was full for this current visit. L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Empereur was 35 euros cheaper and that difference just about reflects the difference in ambience/quality. The breakfast at 10 euros is varied (yoghurt, fruit, ham, cheese and eggs, as well as the more traditional bread, croissants and cereals) and is taken in a light breakfast room near reception. The management are helpful and speak good English. We took friends to this hotel because our first preference hotel was full and they were not disappointed.
