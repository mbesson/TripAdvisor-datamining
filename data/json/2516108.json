Chose it because it looked to be very close to the LA Convention Center, clean, and affordable - was on a very tight budget. The room was very clean and as it appeared in the photos online. The staff were pleasant and helpful and overall the room was good value for the rate. I wouldn't stay there again though - the area the hotel is situated in is rather depressing, not dangerous (I live in another big city) but very run down. I also had to take a bus to get to the Convention Center everyday as it is too far to walk, so not that convenient. Anywhere in LA without a car is a nightmare, so that's not the hotel's fault, but the name is misleading, it really isn't that close to the Convention Center. One more thing - the breakfast was terrible, a choice of filter coffee, toast and one kind of fruit self-served in a really grim little room.

We were woken at 2 am on Sunday morning by the sound of a man ranting and trying to kick down a door and therating to kill the occupant of that room. Needless to say that we were very scared. I called the front desk ( it took 2X for the desk to pickup). The man at the desk said he went outside - as he must have heard it as well - but didnt see anyone. I asked him to call the police. He was reluctant but said he would. I waited a few minutes but decided to call 911 myself. I reported it they took my information and the said they would dispatch someone to come. We didn't see or hear anyone come so I really don't know if they responded or not. In any event, the man came back several times threating the occupant AFTER I had called the police. I stayed up ( as did my daughter and wife ) with the light off not knowing whether or not this man would try to enter other rooms. The rooms have floor to celing windows adjacent to the door -- so he wouldn't need to break through the door - just break the window and walk in.

I checked every hotel in downtown and was surprised to see moderately rated properties were well over $150 a night. So I weaved my way through the Trip Advisor lists until I found the Rodeway Inn for under $100. I had the same concerns as everyone else on the board, particularly the safety issue. I have to say, this hotel is a pretty decent value for downtown LA. The parking is free, the wireless is free, and the convention center is only a quick drive away. The bus lines are also plentiful, as another person mentioned. The food situation is bit dicey. El Pollo Loco, MickD, and a smattering of mom and pop places are nearby. There is a 7-11 next door. The area is okay, not quite the place for an evening stroll, but then neither is anywhere in downtown LA. The check inn was friendly and smooth, and the room was clean. For those of you not familiar with downtown LA, you should know that parking is practically non-existent. Most hotels will run you over $150, charge for parking, wireless, and the food prices will be astronomical. A one night stay can turn into a pricey nightmare.

I didn't have any problems with the hotel. It is an average hotel and nothing fancy. I never had the breakfast so I can't comment on how good or bad it is. The area is a bit noisy being so close to a busy street but I didn't have any problems sleeping. The beds are hard and the air conditioning is loud. Those two items are much harder to deal with than the street noise. Parking is limited (less than 20 spots) but free. The wireless internet is free. They use an unsecured network BUT you are forced to have a username and password, issued to you at the time you checkin, to connect to it so at least random people from the neighborhood aren't on it. Their connection isn't that fast (100 down/30 up) and would drop out once and a while but it was good enough for casual use. The staff was helpful and friendly. The hotel isn't that far from the convention center, probably about 1 mile. I took the the Metro Bus Line 28 (NOT 728). It stops at the 7-11 at the corner of South Burlington Avenue and West Olympic Boulevard. You can get off at South Figueroa Street and West Olympic Boulevard and walk three blocks to the convention center. The bus is only $1.25 and I didn't feel unsafe riding it (7:00AM and 9:00PM). There has been some debate in the reviews about how safe the area is. The two or three blocks surrounding the hotel are ok. You can tell there is a grafitti problem in the area but most of it has been painted over. There is an area that is unsafe though. The area bordering Valenica St, Olympic Blvd, Albany St, and W. 11th St. isn't. safe There was a murder in that area a week before I stayed and a number of robberies and assaults. Stay clear of this area. You can check crime statistics by visiting www.lapdcrimemaps.org. There are a Korean, Thai, Chinese, and Mexican restaurants in the area. I didn't go to any of them.

I was hoping to find an inexpensive, clean hotel in a fairly safe neighborhood within walking distance of the convention center. This place was it. I arrived early at noon, long before the room was supposed to be ready, but the desk person seemed genuinely sorry he couldn't accommodate me right away. He let me store my bags and told me to come back at 1:45 pm, and that he would save the first ready room for me. I came back at 1:30, and he had a room. It was on the second floor at the back corner of the hotel, and was very clean, and obviously recently refurbished. It had the basics, a table with two chairs, dresser, queen size bed with four pillows. There was also a refrigerator (empty, not jammed with items to be used and paid for), and a coffee machine with coffee. There was also free Internet, but you had to get a password at the front desk (why is it that $250 hotels charge for Internet, while hotels that go for less than $100 let you use it for free? Some reviewers have said it was noisy, but it was very quiet for me, and I slept very well. There is free parking, not all that common near downtown LA. The hotel was within easy walking distance. It took about 15 minutes to the Convention Center. You can also take a bus for $1.25 that gets you very close. The neighborhood is kind of seedy. It looks like it had its glory days in the 60s, but there were many families walking around, and it didn't feel dangerous. There are many restaurants nearby, including McDonald's, several Korean and Japanese restaurants, a Thai restaurant, and others, many only a half block away.

The area is OK, not the best location but it's not a dirty rundown location either. It's clean & the staff is friendly. Sheets & towels changed daily. They are washed on the premises so you know they wash them. My room had a slight musty smell. I had an air freshener in my room the whole time. Keep the A/C on, that helps w/the smell. They have free internet, you have to get a free password/ID to log on from the front desk everyday bec it only lasts 24 hours. The connection is really, really slow, that was annoying. Parking is very cramped so it's a good idea to have a small car. On the morning of my check-out I returned to find the drivers side view mirror of my rental car was broken off! There are cameras in the parking lot but they have signs they are not responsible for damages. I didn't have any of the free breakfast. I was basically, coffee and some pastries. Do not waste your time. Micky D's is right on the corner. For a quick bite, go eat there. There is also a knock off Taco Bells next door as well. I did not eat there so I can\u2019t comment on it. There are no irons in the rooms. If you get one from the front desk, ask for an iron w/knobs. The first night they gave me one w/no knob so I couldn\u2019t regulate how hot it got and the water leaked out of it. They do have good ones, you just have to be specific. Who would\u2019ve thunk it!
