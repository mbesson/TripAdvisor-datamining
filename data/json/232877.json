Ummm, the location was good if you use the bus system or the trains. The employees for the most part are pleasant but as for the hotel itself, it seems the owners don't put the money back into it. If you look at the pictures the hotel provides you, beware. It's easy to say that a hotel is just a place to sleep but if the mattresses were made the same year you Grandmother was born you can pretty much forget the sleep part. The rooms were clean but worn. Don't expect to fill up at their continental breakfast or think about a second cup of coffee without paying for it. If you need a hair drier be sure to pack one good for 220 v, and an extension cord if you hope to get near a mirror. We actually walked to \"Vatican City\" from there to see the sights along the way and then returned on a slightly different path to see more. It took about 1- 1 1/2 hours on the way there and a little more on the way back ( more to see on the return path).

We arrived at the Termini (the Central Train Station) and we decided to pick a street and see if we could find a hotel close enough. Well, luckily there are loads of hotels around the Termini which is only logical: pretty much everyone who arrives in town from the airports or nearby towns, arrive at the train station and walking around with lugagge in a big city like Rome can be literally a major pain in the neck (arms, legs and shoulders too!). We were in a group of 7 adults and were looking for a budget hotel with breakfast and Giada was the first one who caught our attention. The hotel guy offered us a good deal and even said \"You will not find a better deal, I'm sure of that\" and he was right, after asking around in 3 or 4 other hotels his deal was the best one, so we went for it. The Rooms Our group got split into 2 rooms. Both rooms were about the same size, the only difference is that one had 1 single and 1 double bed and the other one had 2 double beds. Rooms were quite large and cozy but very simple and the bathroom was very tiny but its job perfectly. The only thing that I did not like about the room I stayed at is that it didn't have a windown facing the street. The window faced the interior of the building (the building was squared with a hole in the middle) and all you could see was grey walls and down there water pumps and things like that. At least at night our room was very dark and quiet which is something I like. THE BREAKFAST Very good breakfast, nothing extremely fancy but there were loads of options from juices to breads, croissants, fruits, cereals, etc... The waitress was not the smiling type of person and not exactly nice but she did her job. The breakfast room was a bit small and things could get crowded at times. THE STAFF Like I said the breakfast lady wasn't all smiles but she was ok. The reception people were always nice, especially the guy who offered us the deal. I've lived in Italy before so I know that it's not always easy to find sympathetic people. **PROS** -location -value **CONS** -no luxury at all If you are the kind looking for a nice fancy hotel, stay away from this but if you are only looking for a decent place to spend the night, this is for you!", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cPossible with a wheelchair - no atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "Wheelchairtravel", "ReviewID": "UR68036619", "Content": "My main reason to book hotel Giada was because it was accessible with a wheelchair. Upon arrival the receptionaist seemed quite astonished that I was travelling all by myself. At the entrance there is one small step which is barely worth mentioning. The elevator is spatious (a rare thing for a hotel in Rome) and my single room was accessible at least for the main part. I was able to get into the bathroom. It was not possible to manouvre a lot inside the room and I could only get onto the bed from the foot end. For the rest on the plus side I can say the hotel was clean and not far from the railway station and the staff was friendly. I was probably lucky with the positioning of my room, which was at the back of the hotel so not facing the busy street. My bed was rather hard, yet I was able to sleep without waking up with a backache. On the negative side I can say that the hotel lacks any atmosphere, the rooms' interior was \"spartan\": a very tiny TV set (that did not function) and a bible that was about it. Breakfast was included but barely worth taking. Besides the one croissant I got from the hotel staff, and the bad coffee (in Italy?), there is a choice of what tastes like watered down orange-juice and stale buns.

It's not the Ritz, but much nicer, quieter, and classier than a Holiday Inn or Motel 6. Of course the hotel is older (it's downtown Rome, remember?) but it seemed very well kept up. I can't comment on the heat or A/C; the temps were just right when we were there, so we didn't have anything turned on. This place is really centrally located, close to the train station but in walking distance of the coliseum, forum, trevi fountain, and a host of other places. Of course restaurants are everywhere close by, and all the other 'corner stores.' The public transportation in Rome is great, and you can get to anywhere from just down the street. We tipped the house keeper 5 Euro's a day and she did a really nice job. The front desk guy spoke pretty good english, and was quite informative about which bus or train for us to take. He called the American Catholic church for us and arranged tickets to see the Pope at his Wednesday audience; and, got them delivered too! It's amazing what just a simple pack of American Marlboro cigarettes can do for you! We have been all over the world, and have stayed in the best and the worst; I would recommend the Hotel Giada, and we will stay there again when we are in Rome the next time. Incidentally, on previous trips to Rome, getting out of the train station was a hassling experience - threading through rogue taxi drivers, gypsies, and what not. This time there wasn't any of that.

I paid 70 euros for my single room, which I later found out after reading previous Tripadvisor reviews was 10 euros more than what others had paid in the past. Hotel Giada is a couple blocks from Termini station but in an area considered seedy compared to the rest of central Rome, however at night it's not as scary or unsafe as I expected, for there are always tourists as (or more) disoriented as me. The room was horrible. My single room looked out onto a disgusting courtyard under renovation (through the narrowest window ever), and the bathroom was dilapidated. The shower was spotty, its door wouldn't close completely and the plastic cover had slits so water would seep out onto the bathroom floor and radiator. There was also no holder for the toilet paper, so the roll was left on top of the radiator..... you get the picture. I was pleasantly surprised by the breakfast. For a hotel so lack of quality, it served a good cup of cappuccino and edible pastry. The breakfast lady looked stern but turned out to be very sweet in the end and happily served me a second cup of cappuccino.

My husband and I stayed for 03 nights, the bed sheets were dirty, we did tell about this to the man at the front desk but when we arrived back to the hotel in the evening the same dirty bedding was on the bed. Long black hairs were all over the bed, sheets, and bedspread. The shower overflowed into the room each time a shower was taken. Had to stand outside in the bathroom to wash and get back in the shower to rinse off. The Hotel is very old, poor, nasty, smelly and bad service.The breakfast room and the food are horrible. The day of check out the maid entered the room at 10am and asked us to leave so she could clean the room. The area is very bad and unsafe far from everything. I will complain with my travel agent and of course i would not recommend this place to anyone.
