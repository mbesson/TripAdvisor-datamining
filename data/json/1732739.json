We took a standard suite and everything was great about the room including bed, shower and facilities. There's a DVD player in the room and reception has a selection of the latest films if you want a quite night in after exploring Istanbul. The wifi in the room can be hit and miss but there's also an ethernet cable provided for a more stable internet connection and very useful for access to the internet and free access to computer in business lounge in reception. Breakfast was great with a wide selection of cereals, fruit, eggs made to order and other cooked items. Also great as they served up to 11am if you fancied a lie in! We ate in the hotel bistro and the rooftop restaurant and both decent enough and also ate at the Faros Hotel around the corner which was very good. If you want a very special meal go to the Mikla rooftop restaurant in the Marmara Hotel on the north side of the river. It's about 10 lira (\u00c2\u00a33) each way in a cab for about 10 minutes or probably 45 mins by public transport. It has a rooftop veranda which gives an amazing view of the river, the sea and the old city. Lots of people just go for a quick drink and the view but the food was fantastic (about 200 lira for two people, two courses and a bottle of wine - about \u00c2\u00a370 including service). The historic sites including Palace, Cistern, Hagia Sofya were amazing. The front of the Sultania hotel is next to a noisy bar (open until 1am) but nothing that earplugs didn't solve - let's face it if you stay in a hotel in a busy part of the old city you have to expect this. Otherwise stay on the 18th floor of a hotel outside the city for absolute peace. All the rooms have double glazing which helps and also look for the tiny air vents which when closed reduce noise even further. Do not miss out on using the Spa and swimming which are located in basement of Sultania. Free access to decent pool (we went in April and sometimes didn't see anyone else). We did consider going for an historic turkish bath but ultimately you end up travelling back to hotel through stressful city and ruining the effect. The Sultania steam room and turkish bath room were brilliant and the staff were great and we had a seperate massage too (all for 65 euros each for turkish bath and massage - 2.5 hours of bliss!) On a final note the staff were amazing and proved their help on our final day at the hotel when we discovered our flight home had been cancelled. It was a Friday morning and most hotels were fully booked but the Sultania is part of the Yasmak Hotel chain and owns 4 hotels on the same street. The Sultania was fully booked but within an hour we were booked into Yasmak Comfort (a literal 2 minute walk away) and our luggage transfered. This made an extra day in Istanbul a stress free one and we flew the next day. Always check your flight status before leaving your hotel! All in all a brilliant stay and recommend to anyone!", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location to see the sights\u201d", "Author": "SurreyLadyP", "ReviewID": "UR128431660", "Content": "In a perfect location and with really first class staff, the Sultania was a pleasure to visit.

Food, personnel and location are fabulous. My only complaint was with the room - and in particular the bathrooms which appear as a triumph of conceptual design over practicality. There is very little privacy in what is, ostensibly, an illuminated glass box in a corner of the room. Thin glass, transfer printed with a 19th century Italian Orientialist painting, affords very little in the way of soundproofing (the door didn't close properly, either!) While lying in my bed, the toilet was three feet (1 meter) from me - not a great view for a 4-star hotel! The glass walls of the enclosure meant that the entire room was flooded with light (not convenient in the middle of the night!) There was nowhere to put anything within the bathroom. Our room had no natural lighting save for a tiny vertical window overlooking the air-conditioning units. The rest of the lighting was either orange in hue, or useless. No task lighting for reading, writing, applying makeup etc. Blue standby lights illuminated the many light switches - far too many of these; tinny overhead speakers for the flat screen tv. Wish I'd have known about the pillow menu - I'd have traded in my rock hard lumpy one for something more comfortable. So - the staff and restaurant (the Olive is particularly good) made up for these negatives. I'd come back to the Sultania, but I'd also try its sister hotels that (according to the receptionist) have 'proper' bathrooms for those of us that appreciate personal space with walls and a door that is separate from the sleeping accommodations.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sofia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "StanimirSofia", "ReviewID": "UR127982528", "Content": "I was in Sultania hotel for the second time with my family.

We arrived late at night and were met at Sabhia Airport (a long way out of town) the reception staff could not do enough to welcome us. We were very happy to get into our very comfortable and well appointed room. I am not sure there is anything that they may have overlooked and we had the first of several good nights sleep in their canopied beds The next morning and every morning subsequently there was a smorgasbord of breakfast delights available. There can be no fault and the staff here were equal to reception with nothing being too much. Our memorable trip to Istanbul was only marred by the loss of a Kindle reader, however the lady manning the Guest Relations was more than able to assist in this and was able to locate it. Sadly it was back at the airport which meant another haul out there and back. There was a bit of a scam with the driver who wanted \"parking\" while we went inside to get the unit back when all he did was drive around the block. Obviously in three days we were unable to see all that Istanbul had to offer however, again the Guest Relations were extremely helpful and informative about things going on in Istanbul and what is a must see and do. In the end we were sad to be leaving Hotel Sultania and Istanbul, however knowing what we do now we will certainly be back and look forward to staying here again.

All sorts of cooked food, turkish tea or coffee, fresh orange juice, almost a dozen bread choices, yogurts, fresh fruits, honey off the comb, cheeses, olives...it goes on. The main thing about the hotel was it's staff. I arrived in Turkey with a cold, which unfortunately, turned into a chest infection. Everyone at the hotel knew I was sick, and they all tried to help. One made me warm milk and honey, another made me tea with fresh lemon, honey, mint, and lastly, a staff member made sure I got to the doctor. They were all concerned and lovely. I was traveling alone, so it felt good to know they were looking out for me. It is a lovely hotel, and I would stay again in a heartbeat. My one and only negative is that they don't have bathtubs.

Whether it was the warm greeting upon check-in, the rose petals on the bed, the great advice, or the enthusiasm for us pillaging the scrumptious breakfast to feed the neighborhood cats, we have never had better service. The hotel's location is perfect: close to the tourist areas but a little quieter, near good restaurants, and peaceful at night. Although we initially found our room on the cozy side, we quickly appreciated the smart design and the incredible comfort it offered. Of particular note was the amazing shower and linens. As mentioned, the breakfast was phenomenal, and our room service dinners from the hotel restaurant downstairs were fantastic and very reasonably priced. The downstairs spa area and gym were also very nice, though there was a slight problem with the hot tub temperature when we visited. On the whole, though, Sultania eclipsed any hotel we've visited around the world, including five star stalwarts like the Four Seasons.

A lot has been said already. But I'm glad I selected this hotel over Neorion, Amira, and Erboy. Here's why. 1) Exceptional Service: I was over there on the 25th. The hotel staffers went extra miles to make us feel a little Christmasy in a predominantly Muslim nation. Hotel guests were given complementary Christmas cookies (I found them on my bed in additional to a daily supply of Turkish delight) and tasteful music (flute?) was played at the lobby. When I needed a ride back to the Ataturk, a staffer ended up having to call a shuttle company many many times b/c the line was always busy. He did it for me without showing any irritation or frustration. 2) Location: As in real estate, location, location, location. I walked to most major spots by myself. (The only exception was a tram ride to Dolmabahche...I could have walked had it not rained.). Topkapi, Spice Bazaar, New Mosque, Blue Mosque, Sulaymaniye, Brand Bazaar, Archaeology museum, ferry docks, Galata... I was even shocked b/c they were actually closer than they looked on the map! 3) Safety: If you are a female solo traveler, your personal safety should be your priority. I never once felt unsafe or uneasy in the neighborhood. In fact, I walked alone around 10 p.m. well after the Turkish Dance Show was over at Hodjapasha Cultural Center (which was also in the neighborhood.). There aren't many annoying people asking you to buy something or asking you to come to their restaurants. It's totally different from the Sultanahmet area (esp. in front of the Blue Mosque/Aya Sofya area). In fact, I came to enjoy a mini-chat with a restaurant owner (across from the hotel and Pashazade) every day who jokingly deplored that I didn't want to eat in his restaurant. 4) Exotic decor: Where else but in Sultania could you enjoy being like a real Sultana? It will be a once in a lifetime experience. Then, why not take advantage of it and enjoy? Some may dread the neon light in bedrooms as shown in some pictures. But don't you worry. Unless you do, they won't turn on automatically. I came to like it, though. 5) Breakfast: I have never eaten better than I was at Sultania. Every morning I woke up and I was like \"What will I get to eat today?\" Plenty of fruits, Turkish bagels (my new found love!), pastries, eggs in different styles, fresh juice, tea, coffee, cold/hot meats, veges. Oh my Gosh...I really miss their breakfast. They serve breakfast until 11 a.m. so don't worry about having to get up so early on your vacation. 6) Windows: Huh? Why might a hotel guest complement windows? Well, I love to hear a call to prayer but not necessarily so early in the morning. Once I shut the windows, I never heard any street noise....even though a restaurant in front of my room was open till late. In any case, seeing is believing. I'd go back to Sultania in a heartbeat.

The nice lady in charge of guest relations was specially helpful, she was there with the purpose of giving the guests good advices about Istanbul, which is a rare function in a hotel.

The sauna was all right, but, in my opinion, the water in the swimming pool was much too warm for a refreshing effect. The hotel has a small garage, but I was told there was not any room for my motorbike. I was advised to leave my motorbike on the pavement where it was visible from the reception. It looked rather a safe location. The hotel staff was outstanding. Especially the people at the front desk were extremely professional and courteous, made me feel welcome and accommodated my every request.

This is a small boutique hotel - the fourth family run hotel in this district. It has a restaurant - The Olive, with views of the Bosphorus and Hagia Sophia on the property which I'd recommend if you do not feel like venturing out one night. Breakfast is included with fruit salads, fresh honey and thick Turkish yogurt, eggs with mushrooms, tomatoes cooked as well as fresh with cheese, breakfast meats, cereals, fresh OJ etc. Many restaurants are within a short cab ride or walk. The metro runs nearby, so if you want to use this system, it is easy to reach the Dolmabache Palace or Museum of Modern Art. Locally the Sultanahmet district has nearly everything you'd want to see on a first trip - The Topaki Palace and Archeology Museum, the Hagia Sophia and the Sultanahment Mosque (The Blue Mosque), The Basilica Cistern, The Turkish and Islamic Art Museum, the Egyptian Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar. Istanbul is hilly and has lots of cobblestones, so if walking is an issue for you, take a cab. Cabs are reasonably priced and can be arranged by the hotel. Be sure to see Istikal Street, a pedestrian thoroughfare starting at Taksim Square. Also the Cultural Center is about three blocks walk from the hotel which hosts a highly rated dance performance as well as performances of the Whirling Dervishes. We had a beautiful room with a balcony on the fifth floor which had a large marble bathroom. It had a queen and single bed, and was great for a small family. Some of the rooms have very small bathrooms with little privacy, so if that is an issue for you, get a room with a hamas (larger bathroom). The restaurant recommendations from Ozlem and the staff that we had were really good -- Topaz and The Ottoman Palace were restaurants that we visited for lunch. Topaz is uphill from the Dolmabache Palace with a wide open terrace overlooking the palace and the Bosphorus. Ottoman Palace is near the Hagia Sophia and is also worth a visit. Asitane Restaurant is contiguous to the Chora Church and has a walled patio covered with vines and good Ottoman cuisine. Quiet live music at night. I think that the church closes at 6:30 pm, so you could arrange an early dinner afterwards or lunch before a visit.

The good sides of the hotel included the very friendly guest relations lady; the general quality of the furniture and infrastructure, especially the good bed and servicable writing desk; the quite good breakfast, included in the price, with nice local selections; the free pickup from the airport; and the location for touristic purposes as well as close to a tram stop (G\u00c3\u00bclhane). Among the bad sides were that the room was often not made up in time and things frequently not replaced (cups, glasses); the thin walls through which one could hear even not so noisy neighbors; the generally not well-enough isolated windows; the erratic internet which always worked but often only after trying 10-15 minutes to log in; the partially overdone and slightly kitschy decor; the sink and washing facilities in the room rather than in the shower, which had too little space to put things; and for me, the location right on one of the main tourist streets of the quarter. The hotel provides an airport car service which costs slightly more than double a reliable taxi, which the reception will order for you. I would advise getting a high-up room facing the side street, but this means to either take the stairs or wait a lot for the very small and slow elevator - I still would think this the better alternative.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "korea tegu", "Title": "\u201cwondyrful\u201d", "Author": "kamoliddin", "ReviewID": "UR102425442", "Content": "I am a businessperson who does commerce.

It was very comfortable, clean and quiet. The rooms have everything you would need for your stay and the decor and lighting is fantastic. The staff are very helpful and attentive. The breakfast buffet is the best part of the stay with many choices to cater for everyone. A couple of tips: If you are like us and like to have a pre-dinner drink in your room, make sure you take some duty free with you because a bottle of very average white wine at the supermarket was nearly 17 lire. Nearest Supermarket: Leave the hotel lobby and turn right, turn right again at the end of the small street outside and then turn left. Walk about 50 metres to the end of that street and you will see a main street with the tram line and tram stop in front of you. Turn right and walk up the hill beside the tram lines until you get to a fork in the road. The road with the tram lines veers left and the other one goes up the hill. Take the one on the right and go up hill for about 500 metres until you get the first main road. There is a hotel on the corner called the Arden City Hotel. Turn right at the hotel and cross to the other side of the road so you are walking on the left side of the road. Keep going for about 100 metres to the next street left. There is a blue sign that points to the Grand Bazarre. Opposite that sign and just about where you are standing you will see Greens Supermarket down stairs. It's only about a ten minute walk from the hotel. Scammers: We got caught by an old trick and chances are it will be tried on you. The scam involves the shoe shine guys that work in the area and goes like this. You are walking along minding your own business and if you are alert you will notice a man with a shoe shine kit walk in front of you. If you are not alert the first thing you will see will be a brush drop in front of you. Because you're nice people and it's your first reaction to help you will call out to him that he has dropped one of his brushes and probably pick it up for him. He thanks you profusely and insists on giving you a shoe polish. He takes quite a long time and at the same time starts spinning you a yarn about his sick daughter/son in hospital etc etc. At the end he will be there with his hand out. We gave him a few coins and he then insisted we give him \"paper money\". I was going to give him a 5 lire note to get rid of him but only had a 20. He said he had change and then tried to say that he charged 25 lire for a clean. We were very angry by this time and said no way, so he passed over a note which turned out to be a 5. So we got fleeced 15 lire for a clean which should have only cost 1 or 2. To add insult to injury the same guy tried it on us again a few days later. We took great pleasure in just standing there and staring at him. I said \"nice try!!\". He just smiled, picked up the brush and ambled off.

The balcony had no view and was pretty dirty, old dishes on a table and waste on the floor, which, didnt change for the whole stay of 8 nights.

The flatscreen TV behind a mirror is a nice gimic although way too small for the relatively far distance to the bed.

She was a real blessing, without her I don't know how we would have managed to get around the hospital and communicate with the medical staff there. I was very impressed as well by the fact that the hotel management was willing to allow one of their staff members to spend her whole day with us in the hospital. This alone tells you how much this hotel values their customers. When my wife returned from the hospital to the hotel she was treated like royalty by the hotel staff and management. The hotel kitchen prepared special meals for her (rice and boiled potatoes) at no charge for three days until she got better. The hotel even had the food delivered to her room and again at no charge. Constantly the hotel staff would ask me how she was doing and if she needed anything in particular that they could cook for her. My wife recovered and we were able to enjoy the rest of our family vacation in Istanbul. The hotel staff were also very nice and showed a lot of caring towards our 15 month old son who was with us. If you are traveling with children you can be very confident this hotel is family friendly. When we left the hotel it really felt like we were leaving family behind. When we go to Istanbul again the only hotel I would stay at is Hotel Sultania.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "momo1984", "ReviewID": "UR69659625", "Content": "Loved the hotel.

The room we got was a delux sweet, very stylish, spacious and clean. The staff is really friendly and helpful.

It is a small boutique hotel that is located within walking distance to the Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque and Spice Bazaars. This is not the best hotel that I have stayed in, and initially I was a little disappointed as it looks nothing like the pictures on the web, not that they ever are! But the staff here a five star. Were it not for the outstanding service, their sincere warmth and great attitude, it would be just another hotel. The staff are what makes this place worth every penny, from the reception to the bellman. The rooms are comfortable, good size, not big but comfortable and cozy. The beds are extremely comfortable and the showers were great with just the right amount of water pressure with two different heads to choose from. Restuarants everywhere but stay at the hotel, they're roof top restuarant is great! I had the smoked salmon starter and it was so big that it was plenty for me for dinner that I had to cancel my salad. Really nice breakfast buffet in the morning and you can have it either in the restuarant or on the sidewalk while enjoying the people walking by and the weather. Good coffee which was really important. The only thing I wanted which was not ready was the sauna and gym which was still under construction. Overall this is a great place to stay, and when you compare the other hotels at the same rate, this is a real deal!", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Sultania", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1732739-Reviews-Hotel_Sultania-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$175 - $655*", "Address": "<div class=\"blBox\">", "HotelID": "1732739", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9b/04/9b0429e38ac9a1808bf0d9da66e35b576large.jpg"}}
