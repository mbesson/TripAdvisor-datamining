{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Location, Friendly, Clean The hotel is in a great location near to tonnes of great shopping, dining and walking distance from many tourist sites, as well as the S-Bahn and U-Bahn. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The first night we got a free upgrade to a suite with shower and toilet. Might want to take note that not all suites include a toilet, but the shared facilities were clean and adequite. The owner is very friendly and the breakfasts were good.The pension hotel expierience is a little different than your typical large hotel or chain hotel, you feel a bit more isolated without very many people around, and coming up the dark stairs at night in an unfamiliar place feels a bit strange. But overall the stay was good and offered good value. I would stay here again during my next visit.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR352516675", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "timwit-TO"}, {"Content": "Good value in west Berlin We spent a week at Pension Alexandra in late May 2007. Located on a quiet street just blocks away from shopping and restaurants. This pension is very clean and comfortable. The location is convenient for access to the Congress Centre while still close to nightlife and tourist attractions. We stayed in two rooms - the first was spacious and very comfortable, the second was a bit small, but we were informed of this upon making the reservation. The rooms could use a touch of paint and renovation. The breakfast was very generous and served in a lovely bright room. The staff was very friendly and helpful - they obviously enjoy working there and are very proud of their establishment. A great deal in a great city!", "Date": "Jul 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR987312515", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mr_trombone"}, {"Content": "Great location but a little tired I guess we were expecting a little more for the price but maybe this is what you get in a great location in a capital city.Just around the corner from all the glitz of the Kurfurstendam Str, this is an older apartment block with rooms on one floor and the breakfast room on another.After flying in from another capital city where for $20 a night more, it was all marble and mood lighting, this accommodation was quite a few rungs down.Our room was a little tired with the obligatory single beds pushed together to form a double bed and a tiny bathroom installed in the corner of the room. Whilst clean, a coat of paint wouldn't go astray.Despite this, our host was very hospitable and breakfast was plentiful. The location was only a few blocks walk down to the tourist office and the nearest U-bahn.", "Date": "Jun 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR477562585", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "grant_lina"}, {"Content": "A Good Value", "Date": "Feb 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR133921946", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mucholucky"}, {"Content": "Good Location in the West of Berlin Good Location - in western side of Berlin near the ZooIts a pension, not Hotel, where we stayed but they also have another location. We had a really small room and bathroom. It was pretty clean nonetheless. 3 star pension not hotel. Were greeted with a bottle of champagne for honeymoonThe manager/owner is friendly.
