{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Indonesian paradise Have just spent 3 fabulous weeks at Legong Keraton in Bali and highly recommend it . Rooms beautiful and clean with nice big bathroom and superb view onto manicured gardens.Staff cannot do enough for you and extremely courteous and friendly.Food is very good and lovingly prepared.Location is nice and quiet and away from hustle and bustle , beach yards away from hotel.Good thing is the hotel is small and intimate and has a really good atmosphere, and excellent value for money, like it so much Iam going for a month in November 2009.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR241943513", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "josephthetirol"}, {"Content": "Away from the madness of Kuta and Legian The room and grounds are fine and quite clean. The location is good for some fun in the ocean waves and nice long walks along the beach at the sunset. The hotel is indeed away from the hustle of Kuta and Legian which we found very nice, but on the other hand you get no alternatives in case you don\u9e93t want to have food in the hotel everyday, it was not an issue for us as we are not fussy and we only stayed for 4 nights, but I can imagine the selection might seem boring after that time. There were only two things that seriously annoyed me in this hotel. One - fellow tourists who felt the need to put their towels on the beach beds every single morning, but would not use them until around lunchtime - although I do admit if the hotel and restaurant get full there are definitely not enough beach beds for everybody and if you happen to arrive in the afternoon you will not find a bed and staff will not help you to find one either. The second thing - stray dogs and cats wandering the grounds - I love animals, but seeing couple of not very healthy looking dogs (and cats) constantly begging for food or attention every day and at every meal is definitely too much for me. I think the hotel needs to decide whether they want to have the animals around and spend some money on veterinary treatmens or not have the animals around. I know this is a problem of Bali in general, but I still think the hotel needs to take some sort of action.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR873050793", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Evka"}, {"Content": "Avoid, very overrated This hotel is very remote so if you like being deserted then it would be OK. The major problem at tis hotel is the food, it is terrible! Because this hotel is so far away from any where else you either have to eat there or spend lots to get out!The staff are very unfriendly and can't be bothered. It was a shame we booked this hotel, based on the reviews it had, it was the biggest let down of our trip to Bali.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR191350109", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "teachersonia"}, {"Content": "Nice Secluded Hotel We enjoy our 3 nights stay at the hotel. If you want a relax  quiet secluded place, far from other tourists commotions  attrations, this is the place. Nice  clean room. The pool is clean. The beach area is not crowded. Just be careful with the high waves if you bring small children.

We did eat breakfast in the hotel, but this is also way below what one should expect in a resort, with eggs and two other warm dishes available. These change every day ( at least during our stay) between, bacon, noodles, chicken nuggets, fried rice, and potato wedges, none of which are particularely tasty. The bread served is obviously bought in bulk, and as it gets older and stale, they compensate by cutting off the crust before serving.We had lunch twice in the hotel, and the quality ( and speed of service) was less than impressive.The beach is ok, but there are no chairs available. However, if you're a surfer, there are some nice waves. Laundry takes 24 hours, the only english tv channel is BBC, and the beds have comfortable matresses but use blankets as quilts. There are no shops within walking distance. The pool is small, and relatively clean, but are used by the surfers to clean their boards, which doesn't seem to bother any of the staff.The hotel has very little in the way of security features, and non guests seems to be using the facilities as they please.Staff seems ok, and if you are willing to overlook all the other faults of the place, just because they smile, this place might be for you!Overall, there are much better choices at this price range.", "Date": "May 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR207846657", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Realtravelasia"}, {"Content": "We love this place!       on the beach", "Date": "Nov 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR318716278", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "amart23"}, {"Content": "Fantastic hotel for surfers (and girlfriends!) THIS IS A HIDDEN GEM OF A HOTEL!!!If you love the ocean, love to surf, appreciate a bit of luxury and don't want to share your holiday with package tourists reserving sun loungers by the pool at 6am and elbowing you out of the way to pile their plates as high as they can at the breakfast buffet, then this is the hotel for you. Yes, this hotel is out of the way, but is situated beachfront on one of the best surfbreaks in Bali...what could be better than checking out the waves from your balcony, and knowing they are 10 steps away and a 50m paddle? With no crowds to share with?This hotel is about 15 minutes by cab to the heart of Seminyak, or you can walk there via the beach (30-40 minute walk). We hired a car for the duration of our stay...there is plenty of free car parking at the hotel, and security to watch your car. There is another hotel next door (Bolare Beach Bungalows), but basically you are surrounded by the local community, not too many other tourists.The quietness is beautiful, you feel like you are part of the Canggu community...it is a joy to see the all the village kids come down to the beach in the afternoon to play and splash about.The hotel itself is lovely. The pool is sparkling clean and long enough for laps. You will often have it too yourself, which seems to add to the exclusitivity. It is set in beautiful beachfront gardens. You can watch the waves from the pool.Breakfast, which was included in the tariff, is also fantastic. It is served in the oceanfront restaurant, and rather than a buffett, you can order from the menu and your choices are brought to you. It is such a wonderful place for breakfast, very relaxing...I often noticed alot of the expat business community would stop by here for breaky, despite not staying at the hotel.The restaurant that serves breakfast is open all day, and also serves room service. All meals I had were of a very high standard, and room service was quick. And it was not overpriced!The rooms are gorgeous, all with big balconies or terraces.There is a good spa (but unfortunately, no gym).The staff, like most in Bali were fautless.I cannot recommend this hotel enough if you want to get away from the crowds. It is great for couples.However, families may find it a little restrictive due to the location.IF YOU SURF, YOU WILL BE IN HEAVEN!!Quick tip: if you contact the hotel direct, they offer various discounts on the rooms, just ask.See my other reviews for good surfing hotels!!!", "Date": "Mar 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR330153394", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "miraball"}, {"Content": "Unbeschreiblich - Sch\u679an - Sauber -immer wieder !!!!
