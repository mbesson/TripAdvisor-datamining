We were rather taken aback. I think the staff is so used to the guests beeing charmed by the old place and that they are so in-bred that they sorely need a brush-up on how to treat guests.

The cathedral is under renovation, and occasionally we were bothered by construction noises, but all work stopped by 5 pm, and the nights were very quiet. The only down side, and it is not insignificant, is internet service. While allegedly the hotel has wifi, it was not functioning at all during the 4 nights we were there. The hotel does not have a business center, or any publicly available computers. Their suggestion was to go to the hotel around the corner, sit in their lobby and use their wifi service. The other hotel staff were gracious about our camping in their lobby, but it is far from an ideal situation.

The hotel is wonderfully placed right in front of the old Gothic Cathedral with a lovely square in front of it with events, live music and entertainers. You can pay a little more for a cathedral view room but we were very happy with our side view and our balcony in the sun. The double glazing is very good and we weren\u2019t disturbed at all. Staff were helpful and attentive at all times and we loved the delivery of two chocolates in the evening. Comfy beds and clean bathrooms with a good supply of complimentary toiletries (shower gel, shampoo, moisturiser, soap etc.). Bring your own conditioner. We didn\u2019t eat in the hotel so I cannot comment about that \u2013 there are plenty of lovely places nearby. Sadly the WIFI in the hotel didn\u2019t work during our stay, so if that is important to you it might be worth checking directly before you leave home. Jaume 1 is the nearest Metro station and about 10 mins walk. Liceu is on the Ramblas and about 10 mins walk in the opposite direction. If you are just staying a few days and will be using the underground I highly recommend the T10 Transport Ticket. Which costs \u20ac9.25 (\u00a37.72) and will save you the trouble of buying individual tickets for each journey. A normal single journey ticket costs you \u20ac2.00 so with a T10 you save \u20ac10.75 for 10 journeys! More info here: www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/transport/barcelona-metro.html The underground is excellent, clean, spacious and easy to use. Tickets need to be inserted into the entry barriers and then can be put away as you don\u2019t need them to exit the underground. We enjoyed a visit to the zoo which is surprisingly large with an excellent dolphin show. The beach is nearby (walking distance 10 mins) with lots of bars and restaurants. If you visit before the end of March check out: www.zoobarcelona.cat/en As you can get a 50% reduction in the price. The Sagrada Familia (modern Gaudi designed cathedral is a must but avoid weekends as queues can be long). E13 basic ticket or more to take the lift up the tower. Don\u2019t miss the exhibition where you can get an idea of what it will look like when finished. (2030?) For a further dose of Gaudi \u2026 try Park Guell at the back of the city with wonderful views out to the sea. La Pedera (Casa Milla) and Casa Battlo are also fascinating. As there was four of us we took a taxi from the airport costing us just under E30 (about \u00a325) and took about half an hour. Be careful if you ask the hotel to call you one for the return journey as there seemed to be another E10 added to that. BEWARE \u2013 and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read it 100 times OF PICK POCKETS. Don\u2019t let it worry you as I felt 100% safe at all times but don\u2019t let your holiday be spoilt. We were so careful, and still found a well dressed, well groomed young lady with her hand in our rucksack whilst having breakfast in a small caf\u00e9. Fortunately there was nothing there she wanted.

The hotel restaurant has seatings inside or outside, so you can enjoy the view and do some people watching :) There are also lots of restaurants around the hotel, all pretty touristic though. The rooms are not too small, ok size. They are huuuge comparing to Parisian hotels. The furniture is pretty old, and the walls can be dirty in some places, but the hotel still very charming :) The service was always very good, everyone was extremely helpful, trying to help to get around the city. Generally, people in Barcelona are very friendly and helpful around the city. Many times they'd take extra time to explain me how to get to a certain location or recommend you a good spot. And if you ask for a good restaurant or a lounge is, oh boy! They'll invite you to the restaurants with them, and you'll have the best time ever! :))) But back to the Colon hotel. The breakfast offers pretty standard options but a LOT of them :) No need to diet when you're in Barcelona :))) In summer time you can walk down the La Rambla towards the Colon monuments, and get to the bay area. If you take left and walk a little bit, you'll get to the city beach - Barceloneta beaches (or you can take train - yellow line L4 to Barceloneta. Taxi from the hotel to the beach will be about 7 euro). They are very crowded usually, if you keep walking to the left side, you'll get to the better beaches - Icaria and Mar Bella (nudist beach). It's about the same 5-7 minutes walk from the Colon hotel to the La Rambla (one way) or Placa de Catalunya. Both are very touristic areas, very interesting, with lots of little stores, bars, restaurants, BUT be aware of the street thieves! The main shopping area is Passeig de Gracia is about 15 minutes walking distance from the Colon hotel.

We had just gotten off our cruise ship and wanted to really explore the fascinating city of Barcelona. The Hotel Colon is an older hotel, but still stately and impressive. The location is fantastic. You are in a pedestrian square right opposit the Cathedral. There is always something happening in the square - protests, street performers, or just the crowds walking by. You are right in the middle of where you want to be. Walking the narrow streets of the Barrio Gotico is amazing! Easy to get to Las Rambla (but too noisy to stay in a hotel there) Our room was on the 4th floor with a small balony looking out towards the Cathedral. Light and airy room. Beautiful bathroom. We were with another couple and they did not fare as well as we did - they were on the 1st floor with a smaller room, no balcony, darker room. We paid the same price for our rooms. Because of the location you can never get lost...always signs pointing to the catherdal Only one negative thing. Our first night the 4 of us asked the manager for a restaurant recommendation. Big mistake! He steered us to an expensive place which was not what we wanted. We had explained our parameters to him but his suggestion was totally overpriced.. He did help us later in our trip for information getting to some of the sites we wished to see. Barcelona is really a great city. Definitely go see much of the Gaudi sights. Each one is more amazing than the next. We took the hop on/hop off bus to get a good feel for the city. Most important tip I can give you is get out there and walk. That is always the best thing to do in cities. We walked to Barceloneta, the beaches, the old olympic village. Visit La Boqueria, the open food market on La Rambla.

It is right in the heart of the Barrio Gotica (the old quarters), directly opposite the Cathedral. Because the Cathedral is located in a plaza, there is no traffic directly outside the hotel, which is always a plus point in my book! But the plaza was alive with people visiting the Cathedral and the weekend I was there, the plaza was host to a Food & Wine Fair - so there was lots to gaze at! I stayed in a Superior Double Room with Terrace on the top floor. I had no idea what the room was going to be like, as on their website for this room, they only show the terrace but I had a look at the other rooms on the site and they all seemed well appointed and had a feeling of space. However, the room itself was a little disappointing and was very small. Where the other rooms on the website had sofas etc in the rooms, this one didn't, but it didn't need it to have as has the most amazing terrace! It was huge and decorated with orange, lemon and olive trees and has an electric sunshade for both sun protection and shelter and the view across the city at dusk / night time when all the buildings put their lights on was superb. I have to say that I am 100% delighted that I chose this room, as the terrace made the whole space an enjoyable stay. As far as the room goes though, it was clean and functional and the reception staff all speak a multitude of languages and were very helpful with my check in and out. Being a slightly older hotel, it is presented well with marble floors and lots of wood and being located in the heart of the Barrio Gotico there are so many cafes, restaurants and bars to choose from that I didn't eat in the hotel, so cannot comment about the food. And the Barrio Gotico itself offers so much, especially in the early evening, when the small shops reopen after siesta and the narrow paved streets around the Cathedral are filled with delicious smells, older couples taking an evening stroll and very, very good musicians busking in the streets.

A fabulous view from the rooms facing the Cathedral, a short walk to the subway, and located right in between the Ramblas area and the Born district, you are likely only a 5-10 minute walk from most of the sites you will want to visit in the downtown area. That said, the hotel disappoints on several other important dimensions. We found the staff very uneven in terms of customer service. There was one front desk person who was excellent - friendly, helpful and very engaging. The same was true for one of the doormen/bellmen. But most of the others were unsmiling, unengaging, and manage to give you the impression your reasonable requests were getting in the way of them dealing with the more important business they had to do. A second pet peeve was security. The room keys are modern digital ones, but they have affixed them to incredibly large heavy key tags. The result is that there is no way you would want to take one out of the hotel with you. Fair enough, but the full extent of the security was simply asking to get the key to your room - no ID check, not even a question as to what your name was. I must have asked for my key 10 times over our 3 day stay, and I could easily have given any room number I wanted. And to reduce security further, you can see exactly what rooms have and have not claimed their key, so an ill intentioned individual would not easily make the mistake of asking for a key to a room where the key had already been given out. As is sometimes the case in older hotels, sound transmission between the rooms was a real problem. Our bed headboard was against the wall that the TV was on in the adjacent room. Even at low volume, we could hear their TV quit clearly when trying to sleep. On the plus side, we had a room on the third floor looking out over the Cathedral square, and the exterior noise proofing was quite good. Finally, a little anecdote that pretty much sums up the hotel for me. When we checked in, the first room they sent us to had a very distinct smoky smell to it. We commented to the bellman that we wanted a non smoking room. He told us that by law, in Spain, you could not smoke in a hotel room but that despite the law, some people broke the rules. My eagle eyed partner then asked him, if it was illegal to smoke in a hotel room, why did they provide ashtrays? He responded immediately, and with such a rehearsed answer that I am sure it is what they've been told to say, that the rooms were carpeted, and they would want a smoker to set fire to the carpet. Oddly, in no other hotel we stayed at in Spain did we encounter an ashtray.....and oddly we also did not encounter carpet burns either. Perhaps in recognition of these issues, the place was reasonably priced by BCN standards. All in all, book it if you want the location and can't get anything else at a reasonable price that is nearby.

We keep returning because of the location (and a reasonable price for such a prime area). This is an older (if not historic) hotel with all the charm of an upscale hotel of its time. It is right on the cathedral plaza in the old section, around the corner from the Picasso museum, and flanked by walk streets on all but one small side. There is always a party happening right outside the front entrance -- with music, older couples dancing, street performers, and a few antique stalls. Many, many cafes within 50 feet or a 5-10 minute walk. It is a 5 minute walk to La Rambla, 7 minutes to the Boquettia? Market, 7 minutes to Catalunya Sq. and the main Tourist/Info office, and about 7 min. to two different metro stops. The rooms themselves are older and well-maintained, but do show use. There is great A/C and a flat screen TV. The bathtub/shower had excellent hot water and a strong water pressure. There were double sinks in the bathroom. The room itself was kind of small, but each room is different. There is a turndown service including delicious chocolates. Our only complaint this time around was the amount of natural light in the room -- it was too dark, a function of the height of the building and being located on a small inner courtyard. A street or alley facing room might provide more sunlight, but watch out for the plaza facing rooms because of the possible noise (yet, they do have nice little balconies!). We recommend the Gothic city tour walk (from Tourist Office), visiting all the Gaudi sites, Hop On Hop Off bus at least one day to get an overview, and a day's visit to Montserrat (again booked thru the Tourist Office). The old monestary high in the mountains is spectacular. It is a metro ride to Plaza Espana, then 1 1/4 hr. train ride from BCN, then a special steep train or gondola to the Montserrat itself.

Free Wi-fi is also available to hotel guests, but you need to ask for the code as this is not well publicised. The reception and restaurant staff speak excellent English and I heard them speaking good Italian and French, too.

The breakfast buffet is expensive but there is a good range of typical continental food and drinks on offer. Check in and check out were very smooth and the safe in the bedroom was free to use (unlike many comparable hotels in the city which charge).

As a family of four with two teenagers, we booked two (side-by-side) rooms on Expedia, paying $169 per night, per room (including taxes). We stayed in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona as part of a home exchange last year, so we were looking for a hotel in the same area \u2013 close to Placa Catalunya and La Rambla. Since our one full day in Barcelona was also my birthday, I was inclined to err toward splurging slightly, rather than being more frugal. But I\u2019m not sure I would have chosen a different hotel in any case. The Hotel Colon (not to be confused with its nearby neighbour the Hotel Regencia Colon) is a very comfortable property. It has a spacious lobby, with a sitting area and a large front desk. The attitude and service of the staff were friendly and professional. Before even seeing my room, I was very confident that I had chosen a very respectable establishment, which has a much higher-end feel, while still bearing a mid-range price. The hotel looks out on the plaza containing the Catedral di Barcelona (The Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia). The rooms were quite large, for a European hotel. They were more similar to hotel rooms in a standard North American business hotel. Although I booked \u201cstandard view\u201d rooms, we were given complimentary \u201cCathedral view\u201d rooms, which meant we could look out on the cathedral, plaza activities, cafes, etc from our rooms. Check-in was quick and easy. Check-out was a little slower, mainly because we waited until the last minute and were checking out at the same time as many other guests. Also, because of the set-up of the lobby area, there was more of a crowd than a line/queue around the check-out desk. As a result, at least one less-courteous guest pushed his way to the front rather than waiting in line. I had hoped the desk clerk would direct him to the back of the line, but I\u2019m not sure he really realized that this fellow hadn\u2019t waited his turn. But that was a minor annoyance and reflected more on the manners of the guest than on the service of the hotel. Here are my comments on recent posts about the Colon: \u2022 Smell \u2013 the hallways had a \u201cfreshly cleaned\u201d smell, but I know people have different tastes, to \u201cclean\u201d to one is \u201ctoo much air-freshener\u201d to another \u2022 Wi-fi \u2013 the hotel had wi-fi, which was definitely spotty. But they did offer us a cable and we didn\u2019t bother because we didn\u2019t plan to spend much time on the internet \u2022 Cleanliness \u2013 our rooms, including the bathrooms were perfectly clean. We had no complaints \u2022 Room key \u2013 Either the recent poster or we completely missed the instructions about the room keys. We were never told to leave them with the front desk when we went out for the day. They were large and clunky, though. After the cruise, we were back in Barcelona for about eight hours. I stopped in at the front desk to ask for directions to the nearest laundromat and they were more than happy to help (and allowed me to use the washroom while I was there as well). I highly recommend the Hotel Colon. If I was looking for hotel accommodation in Barcelona again, I probably would just book the Colon without spending much or any time looking to see what other alternatives were available. The plaza area is vibrant without being too noisy at night or early in the morning. The hotel (like just about everything in the Gothic quarter) is only a couple minutes walk away from shops, cafes, restaurants and the very easy-to-use Barcelona metro system.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aarhus, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cPreferred the location to the room.\u201d", "Author": "Jean R", "ReviewID": "UR116344184", "Content": "My son and I enjoyed everything about this hotel, except our room.

The chair's arms were black at the ends from the handprints of long-gone guests. The wireless worked only sporadically. And so on. The staff was professional, but prone to arguing with you if you voiced a concern. The one bright spot was the doorman, who was very friendly and helpful.

The window opens (good since the room had a faint cigarette smoke smell...not uncommon in European hotels I think). With the windows closed the room was quiet with little outside noise. With the window opened you could hear people at a nearby pub. Other rooms face the cathedral and the adjoining square. The square is a very active and lively place so I imagine there could also be some noise with the windows open on that side as well.

The staff (who were uniformly friendly and professional) were most helpful in extending our reservation, even giving us special rates for the extra two nights. We had originally booked a standard double cathedral-view room but arrived to find that we had one (room 607) with a partial cathedral view and a lovely terrace. The paint, upholstery and carpet in the room were rather tired but it was otherwise very comfortable and had a great bathroom set at an angle to the bedroom. The second room (128) was a superior double and our least favorite of the three. It was quite spacious (with a twin bed in addition to the double) and had high ceilings, hardwood floors and nice built-ins, but it had an uninteresting street view and was noisy. The third room (604) struck us as probably the best in the whole hotel; like the others it wasn't luxurious but it was large and quiet and pretty, with green wicker furniture to match the headboard and a painted design above the bed, and a spectacular terrace directly facing the facade of the Cathedral. . The lobby, bar, dining room and basement-level breakfast room are all gorgeous, with beautiful furnishings, and appear to have been recently updated. We had the buffet breakfast once and thoroughly enjoyed it. We also enjoyed the sardana dancing in the square in front of the hotel on Saturday night, and people-watching at the cafe on the sidewalk. We had drinks in the bar to listen to the piano player and dinner in the restaurant and that, too, was a very nice experience; the service and menu were really very elegant and the meal came with a complimentary appetizer and glass of cava.

(now, why do we say the wrong address? we were given an address at catalunya square, but the taxi drivers and cafe workers on the square say there is no such station there) - we were immediately asked if we saw the face of the robber (\u0131 won't call him a pickpocket), we said yes, and off we go -were immediately sent- to a new station this time another 500 m to 1 km away - when we arrived there, we were told, the system was down (were shown the screen as a proof for a mere second, could not really see what it was) , complaint can't be done manually, and were asked to come back next day, (so what happens to the fingerprints on the table during all this time?) - another coincidence: as we search for the new police station, we meet a couple whom we got to know on the plane, and guess what ? their handbag with passports was stolen in an instant at the very same location, hotel colon's restaurant the night before! they did not say they saw the face of the robber, and their complaint was filed the night before! - hotel colon did not agree to show the camera recording , the police confirmed they did not have to , but the police also did not share any willingness at least to our face, to have a look at the recordings - consequently, we were suspicious that this was not all a coincidence - guess what? our tour leader's backpack was opened close to the Cathedral again, the next day! , fortunately he was aware of the danger and had nothing valuable inside, - it was almost 11:30 p.m. , were all very stressed and stopped by a restaurant and complained about what happened, the restaurant owner was not Spanish and said this happens to 1 in 3, that the city does nothing about this", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reykjavik, Iceland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "SJADAMS61", "ReviewID": "UR79244153", "Content": "Great location.

However, upon reaching the reception, we were told that our reservation has been moved to the more upscale 4 stars Col\u00f3n Hotel across the street for the same price! Imagine our luck! As a result, we had an amazing double room for 86\u20ac/night on the 2nd floor (with a balcony) overlooking the Cathedral and we couldn\u2019t have been happier with the amenities, value and location. The hotel is beautifully decorated in the lobby and the location is simply perfect in the Gothic Quarter. GOOD: The reception service was impeccable with all the staff speaking English fluently as they strived to make you comfortable from the start. We already felt that we lucked out with the change of our reservation and this hotel provided the perfect home for our incredible Barcelona experience. The room was extremely clean, tastefully decorated and very spacious with some really high ceilings. The basket of toiletries provided in the bathroom was remarkable in its selection. We found the door key to be really interesting as it was composed of a very heavy metal piece along with an electronic key component that you fitted into the slot (needless to say, you couldn\u2019t really carry this key around so we always left it at the reception). The free Wi-Fi was supposed to be available only in the lobby, but as our room was just above, I had no difficulties surfing the net on my iPhone from the comfort of my own bed.;) BAD: Our 2 joint double beds tended to slide apart during the night, but it was probably due to the well polished wooden floor. The space around toilet was a bit crowded by a bidet, so much that for a person of my size, I was forced to sit on it somewhat sideways ;) (then again\u2026that\u2019s probably the only negative memory from an otherwise unbelievable hotel). PARKING: Finding our way to the hotel with a rental car was an adventure in itself due to the very tight one way streets. It is very easy to miss the right street to approach the hotel so a result, at one point, we found ourselves driving on the famous La Rambla out of all the streets and we had to circle around quite frustrated for some time. In the end, we were able to find our way by taking Via Laietana south and then entering Carrer de les Magdalenes all the way to the hotel. Parking is quite expensive in central Barcelona, but the hotel had a special deal with the nearby underground parking garage with the entrance off Placa d\u2019Antoni Maura for 20\u20ac/day (regular price is 45\u20ac) which was added directly to the bill (you provide them with the entrance ticket and the hotel gives you with a special exit plastic card at the end). The only catch is that I don\u2019t think you can move the car in and out of the lot as you please, but we never felt like we needed to drive around to see Barcelona. This underground parking lot is modern, large and very safe, but I must say that it has no air circulation whatsoever (as a result, I felt like roasting alive walking away from the car). In any case, the car itself was just fine after 3 nights parked underground. Overall, we were extremely happy with these accommodations in the Gothic Quarter!

Just about everything you would want is nearby including several major tourist sites and some great restaurants.

There was always at least one person at the front desk while we were coming and going -- often 3 people. They were happy with English and the Italian and German guests also seemed to be accomodated easily. Check in was almost instantaneous and checkout was similarly quick and easy.

It was a wonderful start to the day and they serve from 7 until 11. I would describe the hotel as \"updated old fashioned\" -- the decor and the beds are what one might have seen many years ago.

We left a backpack with valuables in our car in the garage next to the hotel, not obviously, but hidden. Nevertheless, the lock to the car was picked open and the backpack neatly removed. Luckily, a GPS (probably because it was in a dark black bag that couldn't be seen) was left behind. Not the hotel's fault at all - they don't own the garage, but they could have been a bit more helpful when we were in a panic. We had already left Barcelona so we frantically tried to contact them. They did a rudimentary check, but they didn't take the initiative to follow up or respond to my email. Anyone renting a car in Europe - be warned now. Cars don't have alarms (you think you are beeping with the key to open and lock, but it's not an alarm.) You are also liable for charges if the car was damaged as ours was, so get insurance when you rent. I think the hotel should have warned us about the garage when they gave us that option for parking, and should have done a little more work with the parking garage to help find it. Another negative about the location - early in the morning on our first day there, I saw something like a gang fight on the street below our balcony. Thugs in black were shouting and fighting. In fact, they had a backpack, and now I'm wondering if it was mine. Luckily, when they left there was no blood (or body) on the ground. Now to the good part. The hotel deserves a better rating than it does. The room we had was gorgeous, a spacious triple with beautiful decor. The bathroom was very elegant and clean even if the toilet was a little too close to the open bathtub and water splashed all over because of an inadequate screen (we saw this in other hotels in France also). The staff was very helpful, helping us with the Wifi in the room (which worked great), giving us info about restaurants or responding to any housekeeping requests. They were quick to help with the luggage - a really thoughtful touch. The location was perfect, in the heart of the City, in front of the Cathedral and a subway ride away from major attractions. Innumerable shops and restaurants are close by and La Rambla is within walking distance from the hotel. Barcelona is a hopping place with people in the streets late into the night and innumerable sights to see \u2013 the Museu Naciounal D'Art De Catalunya (The National Art Museum of Catalonia), Gaudi art and architecture at the Sagrada Familia church and the Park Guell and the waterfront with its statue of Columbus. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was sumptuous, but the restaurant didn't work out for us for other meals because we are vegetarians. With its alternative culture, Barcelona is great for vegetarians though, and we hit a number of pure veggie restaurants. Best one: Sesamo with a delicious pumpkin soup and pumpkin pie. Bottom Line: Barcelona has all the high-thumping energy of a big city, but also the downside (we found blood-soaked paper towels in a subway station). Hotel Colon is a great bargain (of course, we went in the low season), but be careful. Don\u2019t go for a walk alone at 6.30 am (12 am, ironically, is probably OK) and don\u2019t leave your car in the garage next to the hotel.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Monica", "Title": "\u201cWell located but indifferent service\u201d", "Author": "rgerwitz", "ReviewID": "UR50238862", "Content": "First room had a view of an air vent with pipes running up and down.

Staff is friendly, but not very efficient- took 15 minutes to check in and then they gave me the wrong key. There is always chaos around the front desk. HOWEVER, this is very excellent location and the hotel does have some charm, with small sidewalk cafe service right on the cathedral square.

My comment is for Hotel Colon because I was unexpectedly moved to this sister hotel without notification. I had booked 1.5 months in advance [ Hotel Regencia Colon] only to arrive and discover that my booking was useless and that the hotel was 'full'. I was sent to Hotel Colon instead (which was next door) and had one of the WORSE experiences ever. For the first night, we were given a room on the 2nd floor with a balcony facing a side street. The walls were thin as paper and the street noise filled the room thoughout the night. The room was literally a 'sauna' and could not be adjusted. Due to saftely concerns, we could not open the balcony door so we had to endure the heat for the entire night. Upon returning to the hotel for our remaining two nights (at the end of our cruise) we again encountered more difficulties. The DAY STAFF were RUDE and treated us as second-rate customers. The two gentlemen (not deserving of such a title) absolutely ignored me when I attempted to check-in and only looked up disdainfully when I said \"excuse me\". It was obvious that they did not wish to serve me atall, and provided as little service as possible. I had inquired as to why our bookings were useless and was promptly answered with a single reply: \"hotel is full\". When I requested a room on a higher floor noting that our last room was quite noisy as it was on a lower level, the gentleman answered: \"Depends if there is room\" I was not asking for a room with a view....just one that was on a higher floor. Strangely though, the British couple in front of me were treated quite nicely and upgraded to a higher floor with a view facing the Cathedral. If there were no rooms, than why were the couple upgraded? After a few moments, he advises me that he has \"upgraded\" me to a room on the 4th floor. It certainly was an upgrade.....a room where renovations were occuring. One or two rooms were being painted at the time and the smell of paint permeated the entire floor, even our room which was 3 doors away. After staying in our room for 45 minutes, I decided to request a room change because my family and I all experienced headaches and nausea. Luckily, the NIGHT crew were professional and accomodating so we were able to change rooms. At this point I was advised that there were many empty rooms. If so, why was I given a room on a floor that was undergoing renovations? Further interactions with the DAY staff were quite unpleasant. Everytime I went to the front desk, I was ignored. I was not greeted at all except with a disdainful look everytime I said \"excuse me\". It was as if I were trying to \"pull teeth\"!! This perplexed me...I could not understand why I was treated in such a manner. I spoke fluent english and was polite. Why? I suspect the reason for such sub-standard service and chilly reception was due to the fact that I was Asian. There was just no other explanation. I did notice that other non-Asian guests were treated with welcoming \"hellos\" and \"I hope you enjoy your stay\", while myself and other Japanese guests were welcomed with blank stares. Having grown up in Canada, I was quite unaccustomed to such treatment as race/heritage is never an issue in our country. I hope this is a one-time occurence and not the norm at this hotel. It should be noted that the DAY staff were rude and NOT the NIGHT staff. The night staff were professional and the bell hop was exceptionally kind. Credit should be given where credit is due. This hotel deserves a poor rating only because of the horrible service (Day Staff).

I didn't have much choice when booking a hotel in Barcelona because this was a last-minute trip. The hotel is of the old world 4* style, rather than the modern minimalistic kind. It's more suited for older folks, IMO. Pros: The location is great, just across from the cathedral. I pretty much walked everywhere (with the exception of La Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell). The neighborhood is very safe. The single room is fairly spacious for European standard. The bed itself is almost a full-size, rather than twin bed that I usually get. There is a in-room safe, bathroom amenities include hairdryer, bathrobe and slippers. The TV is a flat panel, \"smart\" TV. It can be hooked up to your laptop and you can download your photos etc. But everything comes with an additional charge. Cons: The front desk guy is just grumpy. On my 2nd day I asked him to call Comerc 24 for me to confirm my dinner reservation. He was rather unwilling to do so. My room, apart from being spacious, is rather ugly. There is a obvious stain on the carpet (see my photo). The room also has a musty smell, like it hasn't been used for ages. I had to go to a candle shop to buy some scented candles in order to mask the smell. Bathroom is kind of standard, not very modern. The room faces the small street behind the hotel, and there is a Taverna right across the street. Even though the windows are thick, I can still hear noises from the diners when they exit the restaurant. On my 2nd night there, the garbage truck came around in the middle of the night and made a lot of noise for at least 5 minutes. Breakfast is an additional 15\u20ac, I think. It's way over my budget so I didn't eat there. Bottom line I think the nicer (more expensive) rooms probably live up to its reputation, but not my single room.

I followed this up by researching on Trip Advisor before booking and although most of the reviews rated it quite highly there were a few that made us a little apprehensive. Be sure not to confuse a review with the 2 Star 'Regencia' Colon Hotel which is located behind Hotel Colon itself! Comments about the excellent location of Hotel Colon are absolutely right! So perfect for exploring in every direction and in comparison to a lot of other hotels fronting noisy streets this position opposite the cathedral in a busy but relaxing square was ideal for a city location. Our room was superb - we were very fortunate to be upgraded to a large superior room in a corner position with two small balcony terraces and a jacuzzi in the bathroom. The room was clean and the air conditioning was efficient. Daily cleaning and topping up of complimentary supplies could not be faulted. Even our room service order for morning coffee arrived right on time. The hotel staff were very pleasant and professional and the porters were charming. They were more than happy to store our bags for a few hours on the day of departure and called a taxi when we were ready to go to the airport. A receipt was presented for us to use on collection of our luggage. All very efficient. One or two have commented about slow service at the outside cafe area. We expected this from reading the reviews and although we used this area 3-4 times, we did not find the wait intolerably long. A little consideration should be applied - when you are working in the heat a more measured pace is required. By contrast, if the waiting staff had been running back and forth in a scurry, the experience of relaxing in the shade at the edge of the square could well be spoiled. Even the padded cushions on the chairs added to the comfort. If there is any negative comment here, it is likely to be that some of the prices are a little expensive. Overall we would highly reccommend Hotel Colon and as a post script must say - we were a little reluctant paying so much for a hotel without a swimming pool, but in our case, the in-room jacuzzi was a better choice. After spending so many hours walking who knows how many miles each day, a few minutes in the jacuzzi was greatly appreciated and truly rejuvenating before going out for the evening, whereas a 'swim in the pool' may well have shortened the day!", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a fab location\u201d", "Author": "FromEdinburgh", "ReviewID": "UR8665323", "Content": "My boyfriend have just come back from staying at Hotel Colon from 30 Aug to 3 Sept and loved it.

We had a wonderful king size room with a Cathedral view and it was just lovely. The hotel is old-school, rather than funky modern but in wonderful condition. We are seasoned travelers so we don't ordinarily ask the hotel staff for much but I frequently saw other American guests drilling the staff for all kinds of advice (I'm guessing these people don't travel much or they've been told that Barcelona is dangerous). They did give us a sheet of paper describing all the things that we (tourists) should be aware of, like pickpockets, wandering around alleys at night, 3 card monty type card tricks, etc). We saw nothing of the sort and we were out wondering and riding the metro. I'm sure this stuff happens but if you look the part, then you might be more likely to have it happen to you. In any event, the location is great, just steps from the Cathedral and the gothic quarter, which is great. And about a 20 minute walk to the waterfront and beaches. The beach areas are really cool, with lots of bars and restaurants that come alive at night. There is a great food market near the hotel (the roof looks like a multi-colored pixel screen). They did have a band playing in the plaza next to the hotel on Sat night until about 2am. It didn't really bother us because we sleep with earplugs but if you don't want the noise, you need to make sure you don't get a room facing the plaza/cathedral. They do charge for internet access which you can get directly from your tv, but it was pricey...9.50 E for a 24hour period. That also gives you access to other online benefits but we never explored those (DVDs, etc). If you are accustomed to high end hotels, this is a good one.

You are better off in a hostel. It has no right to advertise as 4 or 5 star hotel. We booked almost seven months in advance and they were offering a long-stay discount at that time that gave you a 15% discount, which we secured. We just got a standard type room and our rate was about $150USD with the discount. When we checked in we were given an absolutely terrible tiny room with two twin beds, even though I requested a king. We called and asked to be moved to a room with one bed and were told we would have to wait until the next day to move. The hotel advertises that it has air conditioning in all rooms. It has a knob on the wall that looks like a thermostat control, but believe me, it doesn't work. The only way to get any air in is to open the windows or balcony. The hotel is in a very busy area and there is non-stop noise. We were literally directly above a cafe and it was ridiculously noisy. The first night we pulled the beds together away from the one wall and the paint was completely peeling off the walls and all over the floor. The bathroom was dirty looking and the room smelled bad. It was awful, but we hoped for a better new room the next day. When we went down the next day to get a new room we asked if they had anything nicer and quieter. The front desk was very helpful in showing us several different rooms. We were offered a cathedral view room for 290Euros! We looked at it and it smelled bad and was absolutely not worth it. There are much nicer hotels to be had in Barcelona for this amount. So they showed us another room that was also smallish and dirty but at least had one bed. The gentleman that showed it to us assured us it was on a quiet street that was actually closed to traffic and could only be used by the hotel behind us, which was a lie. We were told we could have the room if we hurried and moved. So we took the new room which was a slight improvement. This room also had NO air conditioing or fan to speak of. We had to keep all the winodws and the \"balcony\" door open all the time to even be able to breathe- I am not talking about keeping the room cool, I am just talking about getting enough air in that you don't roast, and this was in November! It is so loud outside 24 hours a day there is no way you can sleep. Non-stop motorcycles, scooters, shouting, banging, breaking bottles, construction, emptying of trash cans, screaming people. Even if it was quieter, there is no way you can sleep on the miserable uncomfortable beds. The bed clothes are awful and uncomfortable and it is impossible to get additional pillows. Housekeeping is almost nonexistent. They remake your bed, and that's about it. They do not replace tolietries or do much else. I understand that this is European hotel, but it is certainly not a 4-star hotel as they claim. For the price you can find a much better place in Barcelona with much better service. Most of the time if you had a request or a question you were treated with restrained disdain. When we checked out and asked for the doorman to get us a taxi he said he would call one. It was obvious he knew the driver and they were talking and lauging as they helped us get our stuff in the car. They were obviously saying things about us, but our Spanish is not great. The taxi driver then made about 3 different turn arounds on the highway, each time purposely missing the airport exits. Our cab ride ended up being more than twice as expensive as the ride from the airport to the hotel 6 days earlier! This is just one example of several of the \"seedy\" type incidents we experienced at the hotel. The location is great and Barcelona is an amazing city, so you don't want to spend much time in your room anyway, but it would have been nice to at least have a comfortable place to go back to sleep in at night. Part of our problem came from getting a cheaper rate I am sure, so they wanted to stick us with a subpar room- but they also showed us the 290 Euro room, and that was definitely not worth it at all either.

I stayed in a single room - definitely the biggest single I've ever experienced. The integrated TV was also a bonus as I hadn't brought my laptop, however the mouse on the keyboard was a little frustrating. The reception on the English language TV channels is also poor (and there are only news English language channels - CNN & SkyNews - I would recommend introducting at least the BBC world service). But the room was extremely comfortable (especially the bed), the bathroom was large and spotless, and the room's quaint decor was a nice oasis to retreat to. The hotel's location is of course it's real selling point. Directly opposite the Cathedral in the Venetian-style Barri Gothic, once you step out of the doors on to the square, it's obvious that you're on holidays. The Cathedral square is a fun place to people-watch, with plenty of bar terraces, and there's often live band entertainment in the evenings.

It is very central indeed, being a 5 mins walk from Las Ramblas and from the metro station, should you wish to travel slightly further afield. The staff were very helpful, the rooms were kept very clean, being made up each day without fail. The only two very minor complaints I would have would be that you may find yourself waiting at the Reception desk a while as they do tend to answer and stay on the phone, even if you are mid conversation. The other being that the mini bar was not always re-stocked every day. Our room did not have a facing view of the cathedral but this did not bother us at all (particularly as it is currently covered in scaffolding), it did however have a small balcony. The area can be quite noisy but you would never be able to tell once you have shut the doors to the balcony. They are fully double glazed and keep out all noise. The efficient air conditioning system makes it unnecessary to open these during the night anyway.
