It was fine, the staff were helpful & the room was clean but it was nothing special and certainly doesn't warrent a 5 star rating. The lobby is impressive but generally the hotel is quite shabby & buffet breakfast was average at best (although service was very good). My main complaint was the sound transfer. The noise in the room I was in was very bad & this came from within the hotel, traffic, rooms below, adjacent rooms (I could clearly hear the person in the room next to me going to the toilet....not nice, talking on the phone etc, to the point where I didn't want to even speak in my room as I knew my neighbour would hear me as clearly as I heard him!.) Also, from a business perspective, the wi-fi only worked in the bedrooms (& not in the breakfast room, lobby etc) which was inconvenient. The location was good for me as it was near my companies Istanbul office but was not great for sight seeing. Overall, it was fine, but I think if I'd come on holidays, been paying myself & been expecting a 5 star hotel, I would have been annoyed at this place.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cNice Surmeli !\u201d", "Author": "hosna", "ReviewID": "UR125932103", "Content": "Me and my husband stayed there on last winter and it was a great experience inspite of freezing weather!!

Polite, respectful, but friendly and helpful at the same time. It was one of those places we felt comfortable and at home. The rooms are upgraded now, and was in good order. The price was really good, for the money you give to hilton, you can stay here 3 nights, and probably will receive better service. The location is not the most touristic one, it is more business orientated, but there is a twist, that hotel is located near the last exit to the Bosporus bridge, and near to Mecidiyekoy artery, from you can go to pretty much everywhere in Istanbul. Tube station is walking distance which will take you to taksim square in minutes, the Bosporus is a short taxi ride away, and the guys at the door takes it really seriously when it comes to getting you a cab. Drawbacks, there is no views, overlooking to some council tower blocks looking flats, or other buildings. But we used it only for sleeping and breakfast, so the views weren't a priority.
