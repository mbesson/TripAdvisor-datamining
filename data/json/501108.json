The property tries to have a sleek modern look, but the amenities and convenience are anything but. The lobby is narrow and not conducive to meeting colleagues or talking. The room was small and poorly equipped - virtually no outlets were available, wireless internet service was extremely weak and frustrating to access. The bathroom amenities and towels were on a cart below the sink, hard to find and inconvenient. The view of the sea would have been nice were it not for the industrial buildings just in front. The room cleaning service knocked on our door at 8 AM and instructed me to leave the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door if I didn't want to be interrupted at that hour. The location is remote, and requires a 20 minute subway to the center of town. Breakfast was adequate but hardly appealing. Service was pleasant but not overly accommodating, and the hotel did not provide on a critical wake-up call I requested the evening before from my room, but fortunately I used my phone as a back-up. Were this not the official meeting hotel adjacent to the convention center there would be no redeeming features, and next time I would rather stay in a comfortable, well-located hotel and take the subway to the meeting. Marriott should reconsider owning and supervising this property, or make it more pleasant for guests.

AC are new to the Marriott chain and i was eager to use my Marriott discount to try them out and report back to my colleagues!! I chose this hotel as i was initially intrigued by the rooftop swimming pool (not that i would have considered using this in January but loved the idea of it being there!) but upon looking through the photos the rooms sold themselves to me! A taxi from the airport was around 25 euros and didn't take long at all - our taxi driver was really friendly and pointed out loads of sights along the way - he earned his tip!! The hotel is in the business district but don't let it put you off! During the summer the open top bus (green route) runs along this way so you can connect with the more touristy routes from here! The room was AMAZING thank you so much for the upgrade! The room had a free mini bar which was filled daily with more than enough for 2 people to have as a lovely perk! There was a sitting area and a lovely large bedroom. The bathroom had a very large bath and a double shower which was massive! The amenities provided meant that i didn't really need to bother taking any toiletries which was a really good help, also they provided robes which were lovely for relaxing around the room - all in all the room as that nice it almost meant i didn't want to go and explore the city!!! The location of the hotel may put leisure travellers off but i must say that the location worked really well for us. We were on a 3 day break and found enough time to fit the essentials in. The hotel is located right near a bus, tram and tube stop which meant that we had a million options for travel. We took a tram to the nearest 'open top bus tour' stop which didn't take long at all and only cost a couple of euros. This allowed us to see all of the sights in a day - we got off at Parc Guell which took around 2 hours to complete with enough time to see everything! We found that after the open top tour we were ready to head back to the hotel to get changed before eating out. We got the tube back to the hotel and had a quick change and headed to the Diagonal Mar which was a large shopping centre directly opposite the Hotel which had a massive range of shops and eating establishments to choose from. Having this opposite us meant that we could pop back, get changed and then have a range of places to eat from with our having to worry about how to get back to the Hotel without the need for taxis etc. As a complete bonus, Cirque Du Soleil were set up literally minutes away from the hotel which provided us with a nights entertainment which we were nit expecting - the show was fab and was worth the money paid. This hotel is not a city centre hotel but had the advantage of being well placed with transport links and also having the Diagonal Mar right opposite meant you could safely walk to and from dinner without having the worry of being in the City Centre and having to navigate back to the hotel. Breakfast in the hotel was well worth getting up early for and set you up for the rest of the day. All in all, i have definitely recommended this Hotel to my colleagues and friends..........and i hope to go back in better weather when i can use the rooftop swimming pool!", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cGreat for business\u201d", "Author": "Payka", "ReviewID": "UR124959174", "Content": "Very good hotel for business and for longer breaks.

I know and trust the brand Marriott for many years and have a good idea of what to expect. I was very surprised with my experience at AC hotel Barcelona and I'm now very confused with this brand of Marriott. Not sure if they are trying to imitate W from Starwood or what but their offer is far from being clear. In a nutshell, here are some observations on my stay: 1.The hotel is very far from the center... so think about many taxis rides during your stay. 2. If you stay during winter months, expect to stay in a sauna. The temperature in my room was 26C and when I tried to used the air conditioning, it was heat coming out instead. I asked the front desk if maintenance could check what is wrong and I've been told that the hotel shuts down the AC for the winter months so there is no way to have cool air in the room. I found this very cheap and not in line with Marriott's standards - Bad Surprise#1. 3. The room rates are attractive but then you get stucked in paying a lot for any basic service in the hotel (wifi at 12 Euros per day, minimal and below par breakfast at 23 Euros and parking at 24 Euros each per day). Very surprised to see wifi at 12 euros per day when the trend in most hotels is to have it included - Bad Surprise #2. 4. I was looking to have a coffee in the morning but the hotel bar on the 1st floor was closed and the main restaurant refused to sell me coffees and told me that my only option was to get it from room service at almost 10 Euros with the 4 euros delivery charge - Bad Surprise # 3. 4. Finally, in my room, there was only 1 electrical outlet and non available at the desk. On top of it, the only outlet is linked to the main lighting switch in the room and it dies as soon as you shut the lights at night. So if you have your phone charging to make sure it will be full the next morning (of to use it as alarm clock), you'll be in for another surprise when you'll find it dead empty the next morning - Bad Surprise #4 All in all, I think Marriott brand managers have some serious work to do with this brand. I think having Marriott associated to the chain in this case is not helping the overall brand and will now discourage me from using any of the chain's hotels as I'm afraid I won't know what to expect anymore. SPG has their standards more buttoned down. On the positive side, the minibar is complemetary and the staff if ok. Would I go back or use AC brand again? No. What about any other Marriott brands?

The room was often too warm for our tastes. Even though we had the room temp set as cold as the a/c would get, it never really cooled off enough. We had the maintenance staff look at it and that helped, but only a little. Some good things about this hotel include very attentive housekeeping staff. The front desk staff were helpful and informative. But if you want to mail a postcard back home, the hotel has no stamps.

That said, If you're wanting to use this as a base to visit Barcelona - be prepared for @20 min ride on the metro/tram or a taxi ride - you are a way out of town. Still, its only about 5 mins walk from the nearest tram stop and metros - so pretty easy to get about (invest in a multi-journey ticket). Not too expensive (@30-40 euros in Oct 2011) if you wanted to get there straight from the airport by taxi. Its a pity Barcelona doesn't make the bicycles easier to hire for tourists. Of course, as anywhere in Barcelona, be wary with your valuables. Rooms are comfortable. Mine was on the small side, although a good sized desk and TV. (Music centre, no dvd player). I'd agree with a previous comment - quite dark d\u00e9cor throughout - especially if you're in one of the rooms (like I was) with only a single window: maybe that works better in the summer because in the winter, it can be gloomy. When I arrived only wi-fi is available - and at a cost of @12e / day. Personally I think this service should be free in hotels: especially a conference venue as you're likely to be there on business. I found the staff excellent - friendly, efficient and accommodating. No coffee/tea in the rooms, although we did have a free mini-bar, restocked daily with a beer and a selection of soft drinks. Hotel bar is pleasant enough, and not badly priced in comparison to other hotels - and there are a few around to choose from. Food is excellent, breakfast well worth the investment. We didn't eat there for other meals - if the conference isn't providing food the shopping centre across the road has a wide selection of excellent bars and restaurants for all budgets/tastes to meet up and network/eat cheaper. I didn't use the gym/pool as I was nursing injury. Pity - they look very good. If you're a runner/jogger there are some splendid looking runs outside - either along the coast or up the Diagonal. So - good for a business person, would be ok for solo, couples and friends but I can't see it being a good venue for families. If you're coming to a conference/business nearby - splendid.

There is also a tourist bus stop right outside the hotel, which will take you to all the main attractions of the city.

Check in advance if there are any concerts/matches happening at Nou Camp because there are no stadium tours on these days.

The beach is only a 5 minute walk behind the hotel. Perfect location for a family. [The kids attractions at Mount Tibidabo were closed on the day we went so the kids missed that. Maybe check at the hotel if they can check this for you in advance]. Breakfast was expensive (c.\u20ac22), but we think it was worth the money for a good buffet breakfast.

Interconnecting Junior suite was great, TV for mum and dad's room and TV for kids' room. Perfect. Did I mention the views, stunning!!! Free internet in the lobby. Downside was the AC did not work.

There was no plug socket next to the full length mirror, so hope less for ladies wanting to style their hair (like me..). There was only one plug socket next to the bed which did not function correctly so my phone was not charged overnight and the A/C did not work correctly. No free wireless either. Overall the hotel seemed to lack any kind of atmosphere. The bar was empty and the breakfast was uninspiring with staff who looked bored and uninterested.

The hotel is a great choice if you want to be close to the beach or want to escape the crowds of La Ramblas and don't mind taking the metro to the other parts of the city. The Hotel - Check in was seamless and the room we were given had an excellent view of the sea. We found the staff to be very helpful in terms of arranging a hop-on, hop-off bus tour for us, and also making dinner reservations at a seafood restaurant. All the staff spoke excellent English. Beware of the jelly beans at the front desk...if you eat one, you'll be eating a lot more. They're terribly addicting! There is free wifi (it works very well) in the lobby and there is also a computer area with about 6 open pcs that you can use free of charge. The fitness facility on the 13th floor has an outstanding view of the coast. There is also a pool (with another great view) and 3 jacuzzi tubs for guests to use. I'd recommend a run on the jogging path that goes along the beach instead of a treadmill though. It's scenic, safe and provides a good place for a 4-5 mile run. The Room - Our room (Room 2003) was clean and spacious. It wasn't huge but large enough for 2 good sized suitcases with room leftover to move around comfortably. The bed was comfortable and we got a couple tv channels in English. The bathroom was impressive, as it was extremely clean and nice looking. The free mini bar was stacked with water bottles and several soft drinks everyday. This was a really nice extra after a long day of sighseeing. The hotel staff cleaned our room very well everyday. The Location - If you're interested in the beach, this hotel is an excellent choice. It is literally 5 mins walk to a very clean, uncrowded beach with fine golden sand. Be warned that it's not exactly a family atmosphere. As you walk down the beach, you will notice more and more people wearing less and less clothing. Having said that, I think Barcelona has some of the best beaches I've seen in Europe and would recommend it as a good beach destination. There are plenty of open showers for watering off after a swim and a good number of restaurants along the coastline. Directly across the hotel is a large shopping mall with cafes, restaurants and plenty of shops. If you want the bustle of Barcelona it's probably better to stay in the central part of town (close to La Ramblas or Sagrada Familia). Personally, we really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere of this hotel, the excellent location and the area surrounding it. We took the train to all the other areas of the city with no problems.

What I really liked was the fact that I got to the hotel at 10:00 A.M. and my room was ready. When you travel ten hours to get somewhere, that is very much appreciated. The beaches right around the hotel are crowded but that didn't bother me. There was ample room to put a towel down. The view from the pool deck is great. I didn't swim but liked to go up there in the morning to take pictures. The mall across the street is very handy and it is nice if you want to grab a quick snack. Kudos to the hotel for offering a free mini bar service. What hotel does that? None, that I have ever been to and I've been to hundreds in my lifetime. Breakfast was OK but a little over-priced.

For an 'out-of-town' hotel the location is good; the spires of the Sagrada Familia can be seen from the window, however the main tourist attractions are definately not within walking distance.

After some wrangling, they found a non-smoking room with a sea view, but with twin bed. So three weeks is not enough to reserve a desired room. The room was small and most likely equipped for a single occupant - we found only one set of slippers and one bath-robe. It took us several phone calls and a personal visit to the reception to get the second set. Furthermore, we were not advised that there was a construction right at the sea side of the hotel. So, next morning 7 am we were woke up by some kind of a rock-drill. The conditioning system didn't work properly - the air was always very stuffy. We asked for a technician; he came, switch off the conditioner and suggested us to open the window (remember the construction outside the window)! Finally, when we were checking out, they asked which currency we would like to pay on credit card - Euro or our local. I chose the local.

Not bad price I guess for a European hotel Facility: Clean and modern, rooms are smaller but adequate. Mini bar was stocked with some beer, juice and water complimentary which was nice. To get ice was tricky and was delivered with a $4.00 service charge - a bit annoying. No safe in room which was a concern as we were warned about theft. However, nothing was stolen and housekeeping staff seem very professional. Service: Front desk were very helpful and friendly as was the bar guy and housekeeping. One manager/super really ticked me off when he insisted I was late for our per-paid buffet and wanted me to go pay at the restaurant. Overall: a decent hotel, I do not have a comparison as this was my only trip to BCN. Barcelona: Great city - lots of history. People generally friendly despite their economic hardships right now. Unemployment is currently 30% and theft including mugging and purse-snatching is up. So you have to be smart about how you travel and where you go. Subways and public areas are generally safe. Don't dangle the bills or the purse. Subway system is very efficient, clean and inexpensive. Food is tyipcal Mediterranean with lots of seafood (squid etc), tapas (small dishes of various meats, sandwiches etc). If you are not an adventurous eater, this might not be for you. Our best and cheapest meal was at a place on the pier ($65 Euro for 2 with a bottle of wine). The \"all-inclusive\" meal deals seem to be the best (ie. $15 for appetizer, main and dessert). Finally, TC Barcelona soccer game is a MUST. 96,000 people in one place and no one getting out of hand (no booze sold in stadium).

Upon arriving the staff were super accommodating and allowed us to check early. Our room was clean and comfortable. The frosted glass door to the bathroom took a little bit to get used to. We really appreciated the free mini bar in our room - it was great to receive water, pop and beer each day. Our reservation included daily breakfast - I highly recommend this option if it available. The breakfasts were delicious and offered a fairly good variety. The pool is on the 13th floor. It's quite small and there were not a lot of lounge chairs, but the views of Barcelona from up there are absolutely amazing. The free computer and internet access in the business centre was definitely a bonus as we wanted to keep in touch with our friends and family back home. The staff even allowed us to use their printer to print our boarding passes. The hotel is definitely not close to many of the main attractions (ie: Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas, etc). I recommend purchasing a one or two day ticket from Barcelona Bus Turistic. These buses allow you to \"hop on or hop off\" as many times as you want and will take you directly into the heart of Barcelona. There is a bus stop directly in front of the AC Barcelona. There is also a shopping mall across the street. Great shopping and quite a few good restaurants. Perfect if you want to grab a quick meal after a long day of touring around. Lastly, there is an awesome beach just two and a half blocks away from the hotel. It took us probably 10 minutes to walk there.

For such a large hotel also, the facilities are tiny so the Spa is always over crowded... 5. Didnt try breakfast but did have coffee room service which was good but it was WAY overpriced... 6. The rooms for me tried too hard without having anything of substance. A stereo with no CDs for example, bathroom was the best part, big and clean and had a large bath... however, the bathroom door is glass with no frame, so privacy is non existant! 7. its a new hotel and staff by the look of things, so knowledge of the area was lacking and sparse... they didnt know a tram went to centre from around the corner for example... kind of important. The staff at the desk also didnt acknowledge people walking in, not that its expected, but from a security point of view, that doesnt bode well, anyone could be getting up and around the hotel floors and rooms... 8. There are 4 computers in the lobby with free internet, but not virus protected, so be careful if you are accessing email and facebook or you'll be phished! 9. Sea view but only if you are up on high, otherwise you see industrial looking stuff. Its also not near the beach... you can see the beach! but you cannot walk easily to it.... 10. Double rooms consist of twin beds that move apart because they are on wooden floors... 11. The electricity blew in our room, okay maybe a once off as its a new hotel but still, it doesnt inspire confidence in the hotel... 12. It was easy to get a cab outside which was great, about 10\\12 Euro to centre. 13. On the tram\\metro, the tickets you get are not combined, so its more expensive overall on tram and metro to get to centre, taxi is easier and quicker- 14.

When i first arrived i was advised i did not have a sea view (even though i was advised by email). So the 1st night we were on level 6. The room was nice, just what i expected as it was a standard room, not with all the bells and whistles. The next day they arranged for me and my boyfriend to go into room 2211-sea view on level 22. The room was the same (nice) but the view was lovely. The cleaners were very friendly, although they dont speak much english (to be fair they are in Spain not England, we wouldnt speak a foreign language if they came here). The bathroom is lovely, not a spot of dust or dirt in sight in the whole place, including the hotel. You get a free mini bar which includes-2 tumbler glasses-bottle opener,2 still water,2 fizzy water,2 non alcoholic beers, 2 san miguel,coke and fanta. The TV is what you would expect foreign channels, with english CNN. The tour busses for the green line stop right outside, Metro pretty close. Walk along the beach to the port (7 euros in a taxi). The pool area is just amazing. Overall i thought the hotel was lovely and i really enjoyed my stay, i have stopped in some of the most expensive hotels, and this was just as nice for the amount i paid.

After reading some of the other reviews i was a little apprehensive however we had a great stay there. The location is a little out of the way for tourist attractions but there are excellent transport links - the tourist bus and the tram both stop across the street and the metro is a few minutes walk away - the olympic village is about 4-5 stops away with some fab beach restaurants and bars and the ramblas about 7-8 stops. The location is fairly residential and definitely safe with lots of families around - there is a great community feel with people rollerblading, skateboarding and biking and a nice playground for kids. We had a good walk around and there is a nice little marina and beach nearby but I think a lot of the surrounding area was specifically built for the olympic games and doesn't appear to be used anymore? There is a cluster of hotels all together - AC barcelona, barcelona princess, diagonal zero and the hilton diagonal mar however this hotel seemed to be the best value. The lobby of the hotel is quite impressive with over-sized structural furniture pieces The room was fine - the only gripe would be that we had requested a double room which was actually two singles pushed together - would have much preferred a double bed. I thought the amenities were quite good - slippers, bathrobe, tissues, shampoo, conditioner, razor & shaving cream, toothbrush and toothpaste. The free mini bar was a nice touch too - you get 2 x san miguels, coke, diet coke, fanta orange, fanta limon, and still and sparkling water - I can't believe past reviewers have complained about this feature as the minibar was re-filled daily and bearing in mind the time you actually spend in the room the quantity of drinks was ample for us and a nice treat after walking round barcelona each day. In the hotel's defence we thought that the breakfast was great - there was a huge array of juices, smoothies, breads, cheeses, meats, fruits (extra brownie points for juicy strawberries!), yoghurts, sandwiches, cakes and pastries, donuts, cookies as well as the usual eggs, bacon, hash browns, sausages. The breakfast was included in our rate, otherwise I doubt we would have paid the 20 euros per person charge - there is a little cafe called ramblas nearby. The pool was too cool to use however the jacuzzis were great with fab views of the city. All in all we thought the service was good - I found all staff to be friendly and willing to help - they had an english adaptor for us to use and even gave us an extra coca cola upon request. The internet is free to use in the lobby - another nice touch - and the connection was surprisingly fast. A tip I would use is to check the hotel's rates direct - we found it to be cheaper that way and also got breakfast included in the rate.

Apart from being extremely close, there is nothing good about this hotel. Some of my fellow co-workers called this hotel \"Zen\" jokingly, because of all the ammenities it lacks. For example, the hotel rooms does not have - a clock, a box of tissues, hair conditioner, a in-room safe, and an iron. I couldn't borrow an iron from the front desk to iron my shirt for work, there was no safe to store my passport, and worse of all... no clock! If you booked this hotel, please remember to bring all these items that comes standard in even the crappest 3 star hotels. Another problem with this hotel is the staff. They have no idea what is going on inside the hotel or outside. E.g. I asked for a non-smoking room and they put me in a room w/ an ashtray. When I complained, they tried to convince me that it is indeed a non-smoking room, just that \"guest can at any time request an ashtray\". What? Then what's the point of a non-smoking room. I found out from a different staff the next day that my floor 19 was indeed a smoking floor. I also asked for direction to a restaurant and they told me that it is across the street in the mall. I don't speak spainish, but after half an hour of trying to find directions, I went into the Hilton and the staff there told me the restaurant i am looking for is in La Rambles not across the street. Here are other stuff that I found disatifactory with this hotel. The breakfast is pathetic. The only hot items are bacon, disgusting looking eggs, potatoes and blood sausuage (which was also disgusting). The airconditioning of the room sucks. Do not pick a room that faces the water. Otherwise, you'll be waking up at 8am like I have been. The room gets too hot to sleep in once the sun come out. My recommendation, don't stay here.

And that's what this hotel is good for: business events/meetings. It is too far away from all the sights to use this hotel as your place to stay for a touristic visit of Barcelona. There is a metro station around the corner, and the hop-on-hop-off bus stops in front of the hotel, but I would not recommend this hotel for tourists. The hotel itself is a bit of a design hotel: all modern and trendy. The rooms are comfortable and the bathroom is very nice. It even had a bidet! Beds are good and the minibar is included n the room rate! There is a nice pool area on the 13th floor, although I didn't use the pool. Breakfast is ok, as is lunch. I didn't have diner in the hotel so I can't comment on that. The check-in went fast ans smooth, but I was surprised to find another suitcase in my new room. It turned out that the room was assigned to two people at the same time... Seems like they need an upgrade of their software. Anyway, it was taken care of in no time. The downside was the very poor wireless connection. I paid for 24 hours, but couldn't use the service most of the time because of poor reception. I think the capacity of the wireless network was not aadequate for the number of guests...

The service was also very good, quick, good English, professional. I have especially liked the free minibar: i always hate those overpriced minbars in other hotels. I don't like to drink tap water, and I always end up overpaying for soft drinks from minibars. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for tourists, don't even think of a romantic weekend there.

We have stuggled with accomodations in Barca in the past, as it's difficult to find that cost/quality/location balance - with here things were different. Located in Diagonal Mar, it's just far enough away from Born and other areas of the city that might draw people's attention away from a seminar, making it a good spot for business stays. However, I found about a 10 Euro taxi ride would put you back in the action. Just a few hotels over stands the Hilton, as well as Princess, which I believe are slightly more expensive. The quality of the rooms were justified for the cost, and housekeeping was quite attentive as I always found the room in order when I would return, no matter if I left the room first thing in the morning or later in the day. As this hotel was handling multiple seminars at once, I felt they did a fantastic job. Seldom was there any cross traffic between the different groups, and when groups did exit the salons for a break, it did not disrupt us at all. There were some small requests that went unattended (light bulb removal, extra tables positioned), but these were merely small matters that we easily took care of on our own. Overall, I definitely recommend the facilities for a seminar/conference. Regarding the rooms, I had to deal with the following issues: 1. There were some problems with the air conditioning for a day, which made the rooms quite warm. As it was April, this was easily fixed with an open window, though I'm not sure of the frequency of this problem. 2. It was advertised that the minibar was free of charge each day, but a look in revealed two small beers (one non-alcoholic), water, and a few soft drinks. This wasn't a bother personally as I figured it was the case, but other people seemed quite upset about it. 3. They provide a golf ball soap that is rather neat. Problem was with multiple nights, that golf ball eventually became small enough to slip out of my hands and fall into the drain hole for the sink and become lodged. It took quite a while to remove it. 4. Internet is wireless and provided by Telefonica - you should get the card from the lobby each day as it is needed. I chose to purchase via credit card each day from the comfort of the room, and the two repeat charges triggered the alarm that locked two of my credit cards throughout the stay. I travel a fair amount, so my purchases are erratic already, but this set it off for some reason. All in all, a good stay, and I know if we return to Barcelona again next year for our seminar, we will most likely choose this hotel again.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Z\u00fcrich", "Title": "\u201cComfort and Convenience at a Price\u201d", "Author": "Tagesthemen", "ReviewID": "UR14217361", "Content": "The AC Barcelona is a comfortable, modern hotel with a cool stylish feel to it.

The level of service (and standard of English for an international hotel) was fairly uneven but overall \"OK\". I was here for a conference and did feel exploited by the high price of the room - about 120 euros per night more than a couple days earlier when the conference was not on. It is however right beside the conference centre (CCIB) so you pay for the convenience.
