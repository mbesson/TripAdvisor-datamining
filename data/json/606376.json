I found the room very small but clean the bathroom looked brand new and was very clean!!The room was just what we needed really for a cheap get away, we never spent much time in the room as we were out exploring the city there is so much to see and do you don't want to be wasting your time in a hotel room anyway! The location couldn't have been more perfect it was set 2 minutes off the main road and a 2 minute walk away from the tram line that can take you any where! There are loads of restaurants, fast food, smoking cafes, bars, night clubs, shops, clothes shops H&M was a 5 minute walk from are hotel perfect for anyone wanting to shop! If you are looking for a cheap get away don't let the other reviews put you off the hotel isn't a 5 star hotel and the rooms are very small but no were near as bad as some people have made out! Also i found the staff at the desk very helpful they gave us discount vouchers when we went to Anna Franks house and free map!

There is a telephone in the room, but i found no details of charges. Incidently, if you wish to dial reception it's '9' ( We couldn't find any note or leaflet in our room with basic details on) The night we stayed, some idiots decided they would try and cheat the smoke alarm and lit up cigarettes, and set it off! They got caught, but it messed up the hotels alarms system for the night and a hour of my sleep! We heard virtually no noise, a few street revellers from the outside, and the occasional bang of a bedroom door. Morning continental breakfast, a great spread.

Everything in Amsterdam is expensive, so expect to pay above the odds - even the Hot Deal I booked was overpriced in my opinion for this room (1st floor - not the dreaded basement I'd read so much about!) at 99 euro plus city tax for 1 night. But we got the impression that dear is the norm for the city. The location is good, loads around but not a noisy spot - noise inside the hotel was more of an issue, with revellers returning. But again, isn't that to be expected in lower priced accomm in this city (visitors appear predominantly to be uni aged lads, no surprises why)? It's a 30 min casual stroll from the central station. The decor was pretty tired, bed clean and comfortable, though slightly mascara stained pillow cases. The room was a bit pongy on arrival too but that seemed to be emanating from what appeared to be a bag of poo that someone had lobbed onto the ledge in the central ventilation shaft outside the window (perhaps another guest's verdict on the hotel ;) ). Closing the window and wiping surfaces with the cleaning wipes I'd packed sorted that out. The desk fan left on overnight kept the room adequately cool. No biggie. En suite bathroom was fine. All in all, really not so terrible. The staff were accommodating - we were allowed to check in early and breakfast items (pretty ordinary but edible enough and certainly not the \"3 days old meat\" other reviewers complained about) were happily replenished.

I was thoroughly embarrased to take colleagues to this hotel, despite lining their pockets with just under 5000euros, it was clear that not a penny is spent on the upkeep of rooms or the breakfast facilities. From the moment you walk through the door the tired, scruffy surroundings, dank lighting and disorganised staff are clearly apparrent. The 'secure location' to leave luggage was actually just the hotel foyer, with no record of which room each bag belonged to. The lift was quite possibly the slowest, most archaeic, and should have been an indicator as to what lay ahead. Despite the no smoking signs our fourth floor corridor stank of smoke and no attempt seemed to have been made to fix this. On entering the room I was really dissapointed. Our twin rooms were really only big enough for one person and were thoroughly grotty - Dirty marks on all the walls, stinking shower curtains, bare electrical wiring in the bathroom and barely enough room to open your suitcase. Hoping for a nice view out of the window, we were greeted by a small courtyard within the building which housed the bins, and as our stay went on the rooms started to stink of rotting rubish as the cleaners continued to leave the windows open during the day. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse we discovered that all the rooms contained mosquitos, no doubt attracted by the bins and many of my colleagues were covered in insect bites every morning. Breakfast was basic and budget, certainly not fitting of the price we'd paid or the 3 star rating the hotel claims, but we were horrified when one of my colleagues started eating a piece of toast, only to find that the bread was mouldy. Needless to say, after a terrible night's sleep, a quick shower avoiding the bare wiring and stinking curtain and a barely edible breakfast we weren't as well rested as we'd planned to be for our business trip.

As we had an early flight, we didn't have time to have the breakfast.
