We were then told that they needed to contact Virgin to confirm a booking existed. An hour later we were still being told that they had no response from Virgin. This time I took matters into my own hands and called Virgin myself. I was told by Virgin that there was no problem and as far as they were concerned we were booked in and they were talking to the hotel, which was odd considering the hotel were still saying they had no contact from Virgin. In the end we were finally given a room and told that there was no problem. It was a disappointing end to our honeymoon and a sorry start to our two days in Rome. If the room was available and there was no problem I don\u2019t know why we were left in the lobby thinking we had no where to stay for an hour. Putting this initial issue aside we found the staff at the hotel friendly and helpful with any questions we asked. The room was clean but had a musty smell so we kept the window open. The safe would not work even after we had asked at reception. The roof top bar is lovely and service is good, if you intend to use it in the evening make sure you get in the right lift as only one of them goes to the roof top after a certain time. We only found this out from another couple a day too late! The pool is very clean and towels are provided for use at the poolside. Breakfast was very simple but nice with a good choice of juices, breads and cereal as well as scramble eggs and frankfurter sausages if you like a hot breakfast. Again the area was lovely and clean and we found the staff attentive. It was great being so close to the Colosseum which is in easy walking distance and we would recommend the Roma hop on hop off bus tour which took us everywhere we needed to see in a short period of time.

The location is just as fabulous as advertised, although the hotel is in a rather worn and tired condition overall. The staff was a weird mix of extremely kind and helpful and breathtakingly rude. One of the maids whom I encountered in the elevator as I was trying to make it to the pool before closing (pool hours are 11 a.m.-8 p.m.) actually told me, after telling me to \"calm down\" (I was hurrying) that \"the pool guy might do me the favor of letting me take a swim\". This at 7:40 p.m. when the pool was still officially open so not really a favor. But the pool guy was super nice, as was the evening bartender. Unfortunately there was some weird \"event\" going on the evening I was there in which a bunch of people got dressed up in polyester \"Roman Empire\" costumes. There was some New Agey music to accompany the event which struggled for dominance with the ambient music coming over the loudspeakers. My single room was minuscule and noisy since the rooms are definitely not soundproofed in any way. Bottom line, this is a 2-star hotel with 3-star prices in a 5-star location. If you want something really really nice, try the Gladiatori down the street. But if you do decide to stay here (and the prices really are not bad), my advice is to call ahead and find out about any events that might be going on etc., because I had this whole fantasy of spending the evening on the terrace with a glass of wine gazing out over ancient Rome and instead, as a non-participant in the Event, I got relegated to the back corner of the terrace with a view out over apartment buildings with some kind of Peruvian mouth harp music in one ear and Seal in the other.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cIdeally Located\u201d", "Author": "Notellu", "ReviewID": "UR118327157", "Content": "I stayed a this holey for 4 nights (booked via Accor club) and found the hotel well located in Rome with a 10 minute walk to the Colosseum where you will find a stopping point for the Hop on Hop off bus points (run by different company's).

The Mercure Roma Delta Colosseo delivered on all accounts. The location was perfect. Close enough so that virtually all of the main attractions in Rome were walk-able and just out of the away enough that upon leaving the hotel you're not 'thrown into the action' immediately. If you have seen any pictures of the hotel you will see that the swimming pool is fairly small and barely reaches the waist area. Clearly this does not allow for swimming as an exercise form however for a quick dip to relieve the heat of the sun this is perfect. The roof top bar / area is out of this world. The panoramic views of Roma are breathtaking and there are many 'local' views to be admired such as the park next door, the church opposite and old ladies watering their plants on their terraces. There is an array of seating ranging from double 'lounging' seats to high table seating. I would suggest the only downside is the somewhat expensive drinks / food menu available. Our 'Superior' room was fairly compact although not cramped. The view from our room (306) looked straight upon the Colosseum and the 'balcony' provided a nice atmosphere. The maids were very good in that the beds were perfectly made, the mineral water was replenished free of charge daily and the towels/toilet roll/soap was also replenished when needed. The bed itself was also extremely comfortable although the pillows were rather large! On the whole I would suggest that the rooms could do with a general update i.e. paint / decoration / carpet etc. The staff on the roof terrace / bar were friendly, helpful and very welcoming. Although I do feel the reception staff downstairs could do with following their lead!

However, our experience beyond that was terrible. Upon checking into our tiny room, we found broken stuff all over the bathroom floor with dirt. The drop ceiling in the bathroom also was hanging loose and the couple times we opened and closed the door it made a loud noise and seemed on the verge of collapsing. The front desk did immediately switch us to another room. However, earlier while checking in, we were told that the hotel was completely full. The 2nd room was no better. Once we rolled in with our belongings, we went straight to the bathroom to inspect it. Immediately we noticed there was no toilet paper and the trash bin was never emptied. It was filled with the trash from the previous guests. Also, the bed did not have any bed sheets as a comforter. We had to ask for it from the front desk. The room was extremely hot and suffocating because the air was turned off. We left one of the door keys in the slot so the electricity would stay on while we went out and dined. When we came back the room was pretty much the same temperature. Around 80 degrees! It was unbearable. The front desk said that we just had to leave it on for a while because it was a hot day earlier. We had left it on for 2 hours straight. Any normal, functioning A/C would have cooled a small room no matter how hot the day was. We were also told that since we were on the top floor the sun probably heated our room much more than the lower floors. Excuses do not cut it. Bottom line, the room stayed at around 80 degrees day and night with no circulation for our entire stay. This is unacceptable to any guest. If you need WIFI service, forget it. Make sure to bring your laptop and they will provide you with a complimentary cable connection. Otherwise, you will have to use their slow computer that charges you 35 cents Euro per minute. The pool on the rooftop is a joke. Nice to have to cool down in the summer heat, but it is really an enlarged kiddy pool. Also, be aware of using the pool towels. We saw a staff member hanging wet pool towels to air dry on the roof. Many of them were only partially wet leading us to believe whether they were just being air dried to be reused.

We finally got here. Our previous attempt was ashclouded off and a mix pf personal circumstances and wanting to avoid the height of the summer meant we had to put it off until October. In spite of us being on a no cancellation, no change deal the hotel kindly let us switch dates on our reservation, showing a far more pragmatic attitude than many of the travel insurance companies that people were faced with. These changes were easily and promptly made by an exchange of a few friendly emails. On arrival the hotel was warm and welcoming. Check-in was efficient and friendly. Our room was small but more than adequate for what we wanted, somewhere to rest and sleep with aircon while exploring Rome. Just a short walk from the Coliseum the location was second to none. As with hotels in mainland Europe, tea and coffee facilities are not provided in the room. However complementary still and sparkling water is provided each day in the room's mini bar. The hotel also had a very pleasant roof top bar. We normally avoid hotel bars finding them sterile and over priced. I am not going to pretend this bar is cheap either but it is worth it for the experience and the bar staff friendly. Traveller's Tip 1: Hotel breakfasts don't really suit us (E15 in this case) as we only tend to go for a very light breakfast but the pleasant caf\u00e9 on the opposite corner (just two tables) does croissants and cappuccino and you will get change from E5. Traveller's Tip 2: If you want to visit the Coliseum you can avoid large queues by purchasing joint Forum/Coliseum tickets at the Forum entrance. Traveller's Tip 3: Buy Vatican museum tickets on line or spend half your holiday in a queue. Traveller's Tip 4: Metro tickets and bus tickets cost E1. They are valid for one Metro journey and any number of bus journeys within one hour. A one day ticket for multi metro/bus journeys costs E4.

The room is small in comparison to other countries, but for the most part it is on a par with most rooms in Europe. That means that yes, it is small in comparison to the USA, but comparatively, it was large when taken against other Italian hotels I stayed in. The rooms were very clean, and the air conditioning worked. Breakfast was a little expensive at 15 euros, but it was the only place we saw in a month that served eggs for breakfast. Most hotels across Italy call a 'large' breakfast the usual continental plus salami and cheese. The staff were extremely helpful and they spoke wonderful English. We had a problem with the safe in one room (we stayed here twice, once at the beginning of our trip, and again at the end), but the staff had it fixed before the day was out. This hotel is really close to Termini - in that you can walk your bags to it within about 15 minutes. The pool and bar on the roof had a spectacular view of some amazing sunsets over Rome - partly why we chose this hotel. You could do much worse than stay in this place, but if it is lots of space you are wanting in a hotel room, then don't come to Europe - you will be hard pressed to find a huge room.

I had stayed in Rome before and made the mistake of booking a hotel miles away from anywhere. With Rome's extreme traffic congestion you spend all day sitting in a jam unless you stay centrally. You simply cannot fault the location of this hotel. The Coliseum is a mere javelin's throw away, and there is a great view from the hotel rooftop......From the Coliseum you can jump on one of the many hop-on-hop-off tourist buses (18 Euros for a 2-day ticket) which means that you get to see all of the famous tourist spots without wearing yourself, bothering with maps or overpriced organised tours. When we arrived and tried to check-in, there was only one person on reception and he kept us waiting for over 20 minutes while he spoon-fed an Arab family's complete sightseeing itinerary for the next day.( I can't fathom why anyone would travel to a foreign country without doing this in advance for themselves via internet or guidebook). The one staff member seemed similarly harrassed the next evening. We finally got checked in,and were allocated room 614. The hotel only has a single tiny 4-person elevator, so the queue is fairly constant and we faced another 15 minute wait for our turn.... The room size was fairly large for a city-centre chain hotel... The bathroom was average size and the shower above the bath was adequate, though the seals around the glass screen were inundated with soap residue. In general, the decor had seen much better days. There were a large number of what appeared to be bleach-stains on the carpets both in our room and in the hallways. The bed - although fairly hard - was not too uncomfortable and we slept quite well. The good black-out curtains and quiet road to the rear of the hotel also helped.....The TV had only news channels in English; but then who goes to Rome to watch TV in their room and expects it to be in their own language? One thing not provided was a kettle and tea/coffee, which was a pain when we had opted not to take the overpriced breakfast. There also seemed to be no restaurant or room-service food...There was a small fridge with a couple of bottles of water in it, and restaurants and shops just around the corner. Another disappointment is that the pool was pretty much out of service as there was building work taking place around it. Lets just say that despite the day being 30 degrees, we weren't in any hurry to jump in the water while someone was using an electric drill and power saw alongside!! I wouldn't say this is the worst place we've ever stayed; But it its a long way from being the best...The location alone should really encourage Accor to develop this as a flagship hotel.

I really shouldn't have worried. I was expacting a tiny room with a shower that I couldn't move in and had resigned myself to the fact that it was only for three nights and, after all, it was just a place to sleep in Rome. When we arrived the desk staff were professional and polite, we took the lift to our room on the 7th floor (723 to be precise) and I was really pleasantly surprised at how spacious the room was! Yes, there was a beam at the foot of the bed but it honestly didn't get in the way or obstruct the view of the TV from either side of the bed. (I'm still learning Italian so a bit of TV always helps!) The room was spotless and there were complimentary bottles of water in the mini-bar. The bathroom was more than big enough for two people, although we never actually tried both getting ready at the same time. The rooftop pool and bar are a major asset and Andrea and Maurizio were both very pleasant and helpful. We watched the sunset behind the Colosseum on one evening and it's a stunning sight. We were on holiday so i tend to order what I fancy and worry about the cost later so when our bill for room service and the bar arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as much as I thought it would be, so the prices aren't bad, either. We never ate at the hotel as there are so many places to eat nearby where you can get a coffee and croissant (cornetto in Italian) for less than 2Euros or a proper cooked breakfast for about 5Euros. Give the Mercure Delta Colosseo a fair chance, it's a lovely hotel but (like everywhere) I think you'd get slightly better service if you try and use a little Italian - not that you need to as all of the staff we encountered spoke perfect English. I just think how I would feel if someone came up to me in England and started speaking to me in a foreign language, I'm sure that I would be a little offended! On the other hand, if they spoke to me in even broken English, I would make the effort to try and understand and help if I can. We must (as a nation) really try and dispel the 'Brits Abroad' mentality. The world no longer owes us anything and it deserves some repect! In closing, go, just go! Spitting distance from the Colosseum and if you're quite hardy, you can walk anywhere in Rome from this fantastic, central location. PS.

Cereals, bread, cold meats, scrambled egg, sausages, pastries, etc etc is the breakfast meals, great to stock up on for the long day ahead. We didnt actually eat anthing else at the hotel. Location of the hotel is fab. As soon as you walk out of the main entrance and look right, you will see The Colosseo and what a beautiful sight she is. Its close to the Colosseo metro line which we used everyday to get all around Rome, very useful! The metro does tend to be very busy but it is very quick and efficient and is on time. I think the longest we waitied for The Metro was 3 minutes! We did pretty much the whole of Rome' famous sights in one day. As you can imagine, the feet were very sore by the end of the day.

We had a triple bedroom no. 512 which was a non-smoking room at the streetsite. Although many reviews told us that it was bad on the streetside, we can tell you that the traffic didn't bother us at all, (maybe because we were tiered) we only hear sometimes the ambulance or police which is a common thing during the day. Unfortunately the airco didn't function and the staf gave us a ventilator. luckely it was not hot. after 2 days they fixed the airco. in the refrigorator were some bottles of water for free. we then refilled the water from outside near the hotel and keep it cheap...! the bathroom was indeed a little tiny and there could have been some more light. we only found out later that when you are in the bathtub to shower the water was running under the bathwindow. so towels on the ground. the tv had not so many channels which was not so nice, because my teenagers kids wanted to look also some other programs while relaxing after a heavy day. the window of our rome was a door to a so called balcony which was behind glass, very hot! the bad thing is that the neighbour room was also sharing this little balcony, so you could not leave your windowdoor open.. and the matrasses were old they definitively need new ones, my son of 13 could easely sleep in the single bed. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel due to the ridiculous high price of 15 euro per person. Just across the street in S. Giovanni in Laterano we eat warm bread. hot chocolat and 2 coffee and a cake for only 15 euro in total! Look at Bar Colosseum which opens early in the morning it is on the corner. a positiv thing in the hotel is that when you need a taxi there will be arriving one in a few minuits, just order with the reception. the swimmingpool at the roof was already there filled with cold water but we couldn't take a swim. don't think of a pool it was more a big tub haha just to have a nice cold refreshment after a day of sightseeing. but indeed the view was very nice you could see the Colosseo. so after 5 days spending in Rome we were glad we had this hotel because it was close to many sightseeingthings. my tip for lunch or dinner is across the street you find staria Isidoro (Via San Giovani in Laterano) super! and across the hotel you find the St. Clements basilik it is worth to go in it!", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlon, Belgique", "Title": "\u201cGood value for Money\u201d", "Author": "SIEBENMEERE", "ReviewID": "UR62459332", "Content": "Booked 2 triple rooms at a reasonnable rate for Rome in April.

Also make sure you press for a non smoking room because although I booked a non smoking room they had none and I was in a smoking room. It didn't smell awful or anything but there definitely was a smoking odour in the room. Tiny shower: If you're rather tall (i'm 6ft2/188cm) you will find the shower in the single room quite small. Internet/Wi-Fi: It's not free. It's provided by Vodafone. Despite what the Boingo website says, Boingo DOES NOT ROAM with Vodafone Italy. The cost was 15 EURO for 24 hours access. General tips for Rome: If you're heading in summer when it's hot you'll want to drink lots of water. Don't get sucked in to buying expensive bottled water at places near tourist attractions or you might end up paying 3 EURO for a 500ml bottle of water. Head to a little supermarket (there are quite a few around - eg there were 2 within 100m of the colloseum) where I bought 3 bottles of 500ml cold water for 0.15 EURO. yes! 15 cents! If you go to a restaurant that has a set menu for say 15 EURO you will get stung on the drinks. As soon as you sit down they will ask what you want to drink. A coke will cost you 4 EURO! So either don't order a drink or just get a bottle of water (usually 2 EURO) or just wait until you see the menu before ordering any drinks! Buy the ROMA Card online and pick it up from the ROMA Card office near the Termini station. It cost around 30 EURO which gives you a 3 day public transport pass and entry to two venues (eg Colloseum/Forum). You don't save any money really over buying this separately but it means you get to bypass the queues and get straight in. EG at the colloseum I went straight in without queuing whereas the queue to buy tickets there was about 100m long. For the Vatican: Getting a guided tour is well worth it. You can buy this online also or at the venue. You get a guide to show you around. The price of the tour (around 35EURO) includes the entry fee (which is around 15EURO by itself). IMPORTANT: If you are a woman or a man, you will get denied entry into St Peter's Basilica if you're wearing a tank top or something that shows your shoulders!

We booked a superior room, which has a view of the colosseum. We had a shared balcony, which was about 4ft square and enclosed with glass, so pretty unusable. This was in the sun from about 11am until sunset and it trapped a phenomenal amount of heat that was unable to escape. This made our room absolutely roasting hot, the poor aircon has no-chance! The thermostat indicated the temperature to be about 32-35c, I think it was \u2018only\u2019 about 30c though. As you can imagine, sleeping was tough, but the bed was also terrible with a plastic mattress protector. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that and really ruined the last stop of our holiday.

Anyway, the pool closed at 2000 and is only 100 or 120cm deep so I was a bit disappointed and as you\u2019d expect the bar was expensive.

But this place is otherwise a bit of a disappointment. And definitely not a four star. Good location, close to the Colosseum, and an excellent rooftop pool and bar. That alone makes it fantastic value, especially in August's intolerable heat. My air conditioning worked really well, the room was nicely decorated and had a very comfortable bed. And I liked the marble bathroom too. But like other reviewers I noticed the carpets were a bit stained. And I have to admit the shower was probably the smallest I have ever seen. You might understand it in an old converted building but it's strange in a purpose-built hotel. I dropped the soap once and there was absolutely no chance of bending over to pick it up. I'd hate to see what would happen with someone who might be a somewhat bigger than the average size... Then there is the totally random service. A few of the staff were professional and helpful, as you would rather hope to expect in the service industry. Far too many though were indifferent or useless or busy imposing pointless and petty rules. I arrived very late and exhausted after a delayed flight to find that the bar had closed 10 minutes before -- and was told with raised eyebrows and pursed lips that there was absolutely no chance of getting a glass of wine or a can of beer. And no, they don't actually put any drinks in the mini-bars \"because too many guests were stealing.\" Go out and get your own. At midnight. The rooftop bar is lovely but the lady at the front desk was absolutely insistent that they've \"never served breakfast there\" -- yet another small pleasure that was thwarted by some apparent head office directive. How difficult would it be to allow your guests to take their coffee up to the roof? How much trouble would it be to reach into a fridge and hand a mini bottle of wine and a glass to an exhausted traveller? What on earth is the point of an empty mini-bar -- especially if you've taken a credit card imprint? One last bit of petty bureaucracy. My friends and I were sitting in the open-air, rooftop bar after going for a swim. The barmaid came over to say that the rules required the girls to cover up their swimming costumes. The men were told they didn't need to. Presumably a bloke could sit there in the skimpiest Speedos without causing problems -- but the female figure is too offensive for the other guests to see.

My dates were April 10th, 11th, 12th 2009 - Easter weekend, my rate was 109 Euros/night, my room was 303 (standard double ). Arrival - Our easyjet flight had us at the hotel at 9h; despite check-in being at 14h, we were given a room right away. We requested a room with a view of the Colosseo, but all were taken. We got to our room on the 3rd floor (facing the street), and were surprised to see that we did have a view afterall. (Seems that certain rooms are \"official view rooms\", and others aren't since the view isn't that great..); all street-facing rooms can see the Colosseo, as long as you're above the 2nd floor, I would imagine. Room - the room is \"correct\" as they say; nothing fancy (and weird column in the middle..). Everything was spotless and new-looking. The bed was okay (I think it might have been two twin mattresses pushed together, which wasn't that amazing. The room is small for American standards, but normal for european standards. There's a big wardrobe to store your clothes, a safe, fridge, a big window, etc. Area - by far, one of the best features of this hotel, and the main reason I chose it in the first place. The Colosseo quarter is calm, clean, and you feel safe. It's literally right in front of a bus stop that is serviced by 10 lines, and five minutes walking from the Colosseo (and thus, the metro). There's a grocery store closeby, and this is perfect for doing a little shopping and having a picnic lunch in the beautiful park that is 30 seconds from the hotel. We walked from the hotel to the vatican (which is pretty far) and it only took us about an hour. The taxi ride cost 9 euros to the trastevere neighborhood. Staff - In short : very good. Though, I must admit that the women on staff were significantly more pleasant than the guys. They helped us make reservations, gave advice on restaurants/buses to take/etc. Pool : Closed until at least Mid-May.

Diego was the barman and we had excellent service. He even recommended a place to eat that was nearby and it was excellent - can't remember the name - but ask him - he will know. We also had the 6 euro breakfast each morning - juice,pastry,coffee - this is located on the rooftop (weather permitting) which is a lovely way to start the day - eating a pastry, sipping on a delicious cappuccino, looking out at the Colosseum.

On our first arrival we arrived the hotel at 1140 on a hot (96 degrees) Wednesday in July and, despite being early, after a bit of searching, a room was found for us. We had a 3 bed room, one double and a single, which was spacious and clean although a bit of an unusual shape. We took advantage of the 6 euro buffet breakfast in the \u201cbar Gladiotore\u201d which whilst the food was ok, the girl serving did not appear to be on the ball and did not seem to realise that she needed to order more supplies from the kitchen to replenish what other guests had consumed. We used the pool on the roof which is small but still an ideal way to refresh yourself after a day slogging the tourist trail. There were however too few sunbeds for guests to use. While there was an attendant, he seemed quite happy to allow an unattended girl of about 7 or 8 to swim. I personally feel that although the pool was attended that there should have been parental or other adult supervision and that the attendant wasn't doing his job properly allowing this. All these minor shortcomings I have brought up in my customer satisfaction e-mail to Accor Hotels. The hotel as stated in other reviews is about 200 metres from the Colosseum and an easy walk to the place Venezia and Via del Corso. A bus and tram stop is right outside and Romes cheap public transport (1 euro for 75 mins travel) took us where we wanted to go. Remember to make sure you have a ticket before you board as not all transport has a ticket issuing machine. The city was very expensive and many of the prices in restaurants and shops were very dear, to the extent that it looked like they were just trying to work out what was the maximum they could charge and still get business. Some shops were charging 100% more for the same item.

The location is fantastic, close to the metro and great bus links directly outside which we took daily to get to the other sites - also a few minutes away from the colosseum which is just fantastic. The hotel itself is billed as a 4 star but like many other reviewers said it is more of a 3 star, our room was very clean but we didnt have a view and the bathroom was a good size but again like other reviewers have mentioned the shower was small. The highlight was of course the pool, which on the roof top of the building over looks the colosseum and was completely worth changing hotels for. The temperatures rose to 35 degrees so it was a perfect tonic when we had sweated it out around the sites during the day, also on the roof top was a bar, which was great, although the service was a little slow but it was a relaxing enviornment so nothing bothered you too much. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel, dont go expecting a luxury hotel, its not. But it has everything you need to rest your head and if the weather is hot you couldnt ask for more than the roof-top pool. They even have shower rooms by the pool so we checked out but were able to use the pool for the rest of the day until our flight and have a shower and get changed which was a bonus.

I had chosen it mainly becuase of its conveniente location and had got a good deal on the price. Good points: location, location, location. the colosseum, palatine and forum are, litereally, a 5 minute walk away and the center of rome with the trevi fountain, pantheon and the main shopping streets are also within easy walking distance. The staff were friendly and helpful and were quick to sort out any problems; we did not like the room we had been assigned on arrival as it was on a smoking floor (our mistake for not speicying non-smoking...) but they were happy to change it and even gave us a couple of alternatives. Breakfast was pretty much what you would expect at this level, buffet style with a reasonable choice, staff were helpful and, although there is a coffee / tea / hot milk machine, will make 'proper' coffee and capuccino on request and at no extra charge. Most staff seem to have an adequate English. Lastly, there is a roof terrace with a small pool, open during the summer months, a definate bonus after a long day of sight-seeing! Bad points: don't expect personality ........ this is mainly a business hotel, part of a large international chain, there were some tourists but most of the other guests seemed to be in rome on business. The decor is a little dreary, i'd say the hotel was last decorated in the 90's and needs to be brought up to date. Bathrooom appeared clean, but a little worn.

It's a 4* but should be a 3* as it's a bit shabby for a 4*. However, it was spotlessly clean, and the staff were very helpful and friendly, especially with regards to taxis, coming in late etc. The only downside was breakfast. The selection was good - plenty of hot food, but it had only machines for hot drinks, even the orange juice. However, there were plenty of cereals, yoghurt and pastries. It starts serving at 6.30am and this is clearly to accomodate the amount of people heading to the Colosseum v close by. Best to go down for breakfast about 7 or 8am, and not nearer to 10am when it stops. It is ideally located I have to say. You can walk into the city centre in no time and if I were to go again I would stay in this area. I might get a different hotel, but given that I would know what to expect this isn't a bad place to stay at all. Breakfast was the only glitch, but you make up for that by going for a coffee etc elsewhere. One review mentioned the noise. The windows were excellent at keeping the noise out once they were shut so I don't see this as a problem at all. And the beds were soooooo comfortable. So apart from breakfast and for a first-time stay in Rome, it's not a bad hotel at all.

We couldnt disagree more. The rooms were great. Ours was spacious & clean, we had complimentary mineral water, 2 TVs with english news channels & a colloseum view at no extra cost. The staff were lovely, very helpful & spoke good english. The only minor issues we had with the hotel were that the bathroom was small, our safe kept going on the blink and the breakfast wasn't great (like all hotels ive stayed in abroad). The view from the rooftop pool & bar was amazing, however the pool was really cold (too cold to use) and there weren't many loungers to use & they were taken very quickly. The lifeguard moved our taowels also when we went to get some lunch which I didnt appreciate! Rome is amazing and you can walk to all the main attractions from this hotel as long as you dont mind walking for most of the day. However, there are lots of tour bus stops outside the hotel and the metro close to the hotel if you dont like walking We went to lots of restaurants in the surrounding area & they were all reasonably priced & very nice. (dont go to the Piazza Navona for a meal - 18 Euros for a pint of lager is just taking advantage of the tourists!). Nowhere has english football on so if you are an avid football fan, dont go when there is an international match on because you will miss it (as we did!) For all animal lovers, go to Torre Argentina (you will find it on the map the hotel reception will give you on arrival). This is where one of the 4 roman cat sancturarys are based & is within the ruins. You can look around, interact with the cats & chat with the volunteers (who do such a brlliant job!). They do not receive any governent funding & rely solely on donations & gift shop purchases, so please pop in & give what you can. On the whole we had a brilliant time, I could go on all day about how lovely rome is! When you get off the plane & travel to the hotel try to ignore the huge amount of grafitti on buildings etc, its not that bad in the centre (however, it's still bad, its such a shame!). Visit the Trevi Fountain, its breathtaking! Hold on to your bags though, its packed with tourists, illegal traders & pick pockets! To transfer to & from the airport , do not use the Terravision coaches, they are more expensive than the others & ours broke down on its way to collect us & the employee didnt relay this to the passengers waiting & made us late booking in for our flight home.

It seemed like the rooms on the corners of the hotel were larger and they had a tub and a shower in the bathroom (even though the tubs were very small). Our room only had a shower stall which was tiny, a larger person would not fit in it comfortably (smaller people don't even fit in it comfortably). We couldn't get the heat turned off completely or the air turned on in our room. Other guests also complained about how hot and uncomfortable their room was. We had to sleep with the windows open which made it very comfortable for us. Unfortunately there are no screens on the windows and the streets are EXTREMELY noisy all night long (the noise stops breifly around 5am only to start about an hour or 2 later).
