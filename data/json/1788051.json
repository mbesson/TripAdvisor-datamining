The hotel in itself is very good with well appointed rooms , tea coffee maker , electronic safe etc but the house keeping staff does not speak English.We asked for Milk powder sachets and toilet roll over the phone for two days but to no avail..finally I went down to reception to give the same in writing,Promptly I was presented with two towels the next day..so much so for written instructions All in all a good hotel and ideal for big conventions but if you have Turkey sight seeing on your wishlist , the best is to stay near Taksim square on the European side which is where the party is !!", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201c2 days for my company's symposium\u201d", "Author": "neoxneox", "ReviewID": "UR126952887", "Content": "the convention centre was huge enough for a symposium and the sound/visual sheme was ok. the hotel bars were rich and the stuff was wwll educated.the rooms were really excellent and teh sea sight is so nice,the hotel is so close to the sea and you can see the marmara sea islands from the frontside rooms.(if you want to visit the islands too,you can reach the port of boats to islands so easyl about 10 minutes travel by a taxi,indeed.)", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Property\u201d", "Author": "Rajandani", "ReviewID": "UR126261235", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights in March 12 and enjoyed every bit of my stay at this property. Hotel is very strategically located facing the Sea of Marmara. I stayed at sea facing room which was very large and bed was also very large, nice and comfortable. There is a cable connection for internet and it works and has a great speed. Rooms are well appointed. Rooms facing the sea are large whereas the other rooms are of regular size. All fittings in bath room are of great quality and service is excellent. Hotel food is equally great and has variety. Large lobby with many information displays. Ideal hotel for conventions. Sabiha International airport is just 15 minutes drive. Nearest shopping at Pendorya is 5 minutes drive.

The service quality is very high, as one would expect in Turkey. What blew me away was the spa & gym: the massive and very modern gym, outdoor pool area (complete with hammocks), indoor pool area with jacuzzis, sauna, steam bath and a three room hamam are all free to use for any guest. I spent some time relaxing in the hamam after each work day. I only had one meal from the room service but that was very good and the portion more than generous. (The mushroom pasta was listed as a starter but was easily a full dinner for me.) The breakfast buffet was pretty good, featuring all sorts of fruit, vegetables and salads, as well as of course Turkish specialties like simit and helva. You can have breakfast on the terrace with a view on the sea. My room was small but very well equipped. It was facing the town, so I got a bit of noise from traffic and mosques, but it really didn't bother me. I know though that a colleague of mine though, staying at the same hotel a week later, paid for an upgrade to get a room facing the sea.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hyderabad, India", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel away from city\u201d", "Author": "Eldhomittan", "ReviewID": "UR112514591", "Content": "The hotel is a brand new one.
