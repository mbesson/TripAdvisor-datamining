I stayed on the top floor. There were some facts that you should be aware of. 1) The room is very small. While it could sleep 3 there is really no room for luggage or clothes with soo many people. There is a queen bed and twin bed, set-up bunk-bed style in the room. There is only 1 foot of walking space from the wall around the foot of the queen bed. 2) The wall are concrete. This is good for sound, but there is no insulation, thus the walls are cold to the touch.The floors are cheap pads not really carpet. Don't let the photos fool you. 3) The shower is very small and is next to the bed. I bought a bath mat for the shower and a towel mat for the floor as you will step out to a cold floor after showering. There is really no room to dry in the shower. It is small. The light will wake others so watch out. 4) If you are sharing this room with friends, expect to get dressed in the toilet area. It is the only other area with a door. It is larger than the shower though. 5) The internet will not work well if you are located on the end of the hall. It is weak there and I had problems. 6) Like other hotels in Europe, you will not be able to control the temperature. Now that you know these things, I will tell you that I brought a few things to make my stay much more comfortable. I took a collapsible closet. It has about 5 compartments I got from IKEA. It was cheap and help out a lot. The mats and a few removable hooks for shower caps, belts and keys & such were really needed. Normally, I would not consider these things, but this hotel was cheap, the location was very very good (2 blocks from largest piece of the Berlin Wall and Checkpoint Charlie) and the english speaking staff and breakfast was good enough. It is a good place for a backpacker of young married couple.

(Get rid of your leftover coins and save on taxi) Take bus M29 from the junction of Anhalter Strasse (direction Movenpick hotel) and stop at Ulanstrasse bus stop. At the same bus stop. Take bus M109 to TEGEL. Pay 2.30euro on bus M29, keep the ticket and show it to the bus M109 to continue the ride. Ride ends at the airport. Trip takes a total of 45 mins. (My bus ride started around 14h00 and ended around 14h45) - Buses have next stop LCD indicators so you won't get lost. Back to the hotel review. If you are staying 8 nights like me. Skip the 6 euro breakfast buffet. It's okay but it gets a little monotonous as the items in the little buffet is the same every day. It is ok if you stayed for 1-3 nights. ETAP- if you read this.

The bicycle hire was a definate plus (with extra bikes available at the Ibis next door should they all be hired out here) Only slight niggle was the heat.

It also has a perfect connection with the main railway station (Hauptbahnhof) via the M41 city bus - also in the middle of the night.

Two or three metro stops and you are near the Brandenburger Tor, Unter Den Linden and Museum Island. So this is definitely *the* place for your first visit to Berlin. The hotel itself is pretty basic, but clean and comfortable. We were given a room on the first floor, with window to the street, so I was a bit afraid about the noise, but with the window closed (and yes, there was individual air conditioning) there were no problems with that. Walls are a bit thin, but it wasn't that bad - similarly, in fact, to many higher class hotels. The room houses one double bed and a bunk bed overhead, has private toilet and shower chamber plus sink (two soaps and two glasses) and a mirror. A set of coat hangers, small TV (never turned it on), a small shelf and that be it. The room was clean, though nobody vacuum-cleaned it for the four days we were there and pillows could be a bit more comfortable. But hey, that's OK, we knew the standard beforehand. Breakfast was really worth the 6 EUR/pers we paid for it.

The sink is in the room. I was in a group of three guys so it was cool, but I could see it awkward for a family). -Small Rooms (Okay, this is Europe, I get it, every hotel seems to have small rooms. There is a desk and a small TV, but there is really no room to move around. It's definitely not the type of room you want to spend your free time in). Air Conditioning (I don't think our air conditioning worked properly and since it was summer in Berlin we had to keep the window open at night and it was noisy).

It's in an excellent position on Anhalterstrasse, 2 mins walk from Anhalter Bahnhof. Near Potsdamerplatz and Kulturforum museums too, tho' I wd quibble slightly with the name as Potsdamerplatz is an easy walk (or one stop on the S-Bahn) but not its nearest reference point. It's also near Kochstrasse U-Bahn and Checkpoint Charlie, with Martin-Gropius-Bau, Topographie des Terrors and part of the Wall on the next street. The S-Bahn line takes you to Potsdamerplatz and Friedrichstrasse for easy connections. Note that trains heading south from Potsdamerplatz don't (always?) stop at Anhalterbahnhof: you have to go on to Yorckstrasse and go to opposite platform (Retourbahnsteig) to get train back to Anhalter. There's an Italian restaurant on the corner opposite the station if you don't want to go further afield. Payphone and drinks machine in the hotel foyer. Checkout time is 12 (later than lots of places) and if you need a taxi, staff at reception will press a button and a taxi arrives in a minute or two.", "Date": "June 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deltona, FL", "Title": "\u201cGood Value- Central Location\u201d", "Author": "rs899", "ReviewID": "UR3315618", "Content": "My family (myself, wife and 4 yr old daughter ) stayed in this hotel in mid-March 2005. The hotel (and I believe the Ibis and Suitehotel next to it) were built in late 2004, so the room was new. That said, the shower door was already falling off its hinges. I have never stayed in an Etap before, but I fear that these rooms age poorly as hotels go. Anyway, the room was clean and quiet if small. Our room was on the street, so there was noise with the window open- but with the window closed it was fine- you may want one facing the back. There was about 18 inches of space to the wall at the bottom of the bed in which to move across the room. The upper bunk bed was OK for a child ( I myself slept there two nights)- the bottom bed's mattress was very firm (uncomfortable)foam. The hotel is not really at Potsdamer Platz, but is located on Anhalter Strasse a few blocks away. It is about 100m from the Anhalter Banhof S-Bahn stop and is just south of the Topographie of Terror exhibit (old Gestapo and SS Headquarters) and an intact section of Berlin Wall near Checkpoint Charlie. This is a very good central location. Breakfast was a buffet of rolls, cereals yogurt etc for 5 euro- not bad. Hotel staff spoke English very well and was quite helpful. We paid 50 euro for the room and were happy with it , all told", "Date": "March 31, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Etap Berlin Potsdamer Platz", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d556166-Reviews-Etap_Berlin_Potsdamer_Platz-Berlin.html", "Price": "$56 - $83*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Anhalter Str. 6</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10963</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "556166", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cb/db/23/hoteleingang.jpg"}}
