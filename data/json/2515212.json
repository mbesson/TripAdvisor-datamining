Room was spacious, fridge stocked with soft drinks, they even provided me with a UK adapter when mine failed. Breakfast was simple, but for the size of the hotel was very well presented. The free coffee machine in reception was just what we needed.

I arrived pretty late after dinner, so I didn't get the full experience, but what I did get was truly excellent. The building is oldish, but everything inside is modern, stylish and new. Even at around 11 the reception was helpful and polite and I was quickly off to my room on the first floor. The floors are carpeted in deep, vivid scarlet carpet and there are some very funky plastic chairs in the corridors. My room was around a corner and through another door and I was thinking I was in for a tiny cupboard. The truth was quite the opposite. It was huge by Paris standards, with full length windows the whole length of the right side of the room with powered curtains floor to ceiling. There was a Bang and Olufsen TV and hi-fi in the room and the bed had 3 pillows across it! The bathroom (it was a bath, so no separate shower, but the unit in the bath had plenty of pressure) was fitted with wide sliding doors so you could luxuriate in the bath with the doors to the room open if you liked. There was plenty of space in cupboards and desks and the thick red carpet extended into the room. There was free wi-fi (often not the case in Paris I've found) too. The bed proved very comfy and I slept well. Next morning I had a pleasant buffet breakfast overlooking the smallish gym which looked plenty for a hotel stay - I believe there's a pool too, but this trip I had no chance to investigate either. Overall, this was a highly impressive hotel at (for Paris) a reasonable price. Next time I'm there I shall make a point of staying here again!

This hotel was our favourite. The location could not be surpassed, the rooms were large, modern and clean and the service was good. For example, after finding out that the air conditioning did not work in our first room, the management arranged for a mechanic to look at it within half an hour and then organised for an upgrade immediately once they found out that the problem could not be fixed in the short term. They also organised photocopying for us of several travel documents without an issue.

They have recently changed to he Ascott brand and everything is in shambles. They cannot get the reservations right. Was supposed to be prepaid but they had not authorized my card by check in time.

For that kind of money I would expect more. Everything is clean and in reasonable condition, some things may be dated like faucets and fittings etc. The room was huge but if what they said was anything to go by, I was getting an upgrade so if I got what I had paid for I would not be happy at all.
