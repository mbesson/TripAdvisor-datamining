I've used it on a number of occasions, most recently in May 2011. It is conveniently sited within 5 minutes walk of King's Cross Station - though taxi drivers sometimes grumble because it's only a short \"fare\". The major hurdle for me, as someone who is mildly disabled, is the absence of a lift, but a request for a ground floor room for that cause is met without question whenever possible. The rooms vary in size and outlook, which is unavoidable in a building of this age, but I've never found it to be anything less than spotless and the staff are always professional. Though the standard of their friendliness does vary, I've never met anything approaching rudeness, and most are very helpful. Breakfast is a mixture of buffet and cooked, though the breakfast room could be a little bigger and can get a bit crowded sometimes. The biggest issue in finding somewhere in London is price, followed by and linked to locale and facilities. The kind of hotel that has a lift and room service is in a different price bracket; if I were staying in London for any length of time, I'd probably go to somewhere with more facilities and then grumble about the cost. If one's stay is no more than one through three nights then this is fair choice. For the price bracket that the Mentone is in, then it has the level of facilities that are usual, and overall is significantly better than average. I've stayed in places in this price-range that were nowhere near as pleasant. In the end, your experience will come down to expectation. If you expect a three or four star hotel, you'll not find it here; but if a one-to-two star guest house will meet your needs, then you will be more than satisfied.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Duluth, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cA tiny step above a youth hostel\u201d", "Author": "reptevia", "ReviewID": "UR119020828", "Content": "The staff, especially Louis, were friendly and helpful.

When we arrived the girl on duty was a bit dozy and not very welcoming took her about 20 minutes to find our booking even after writhing our name down and giving her the booking reference. One of our two rooms was ready (we were early) we decided to dump our cases there so she led us to the stairs .. no lift 5 girls 7 cases ... a new carpet was being laid so we had to lug our stuff around two workmen, a loose unsecured carpet and visible nails!!! When we got back that evening the men appeared to be gone but the carpet was not complete, two portions of the stairs where not completed during our stay, one directly outside our door where nails where clearly visible and highly dangerous!!! Our second room was ready at this stage but it required us to take our cases down one flight of stairs and up another at the other side of the hotel ... all the way to the attic!!!! Literally!!! The bathroom in our double room served its purpose but overall the room could benefit from a lick of paint and modernized bed coverings.

On Saturday night there was some noise from the street at night, but we had known before our arrival that students live in this area, so we actually expected worse. We were a bit disappointed by breakfast. It wasn't horrible, but a canned tomato is not appropriate, I think. Most ladies serving breakfast were nice and efficient.

People had to queue all the way up the staircase outside to get a table, as breakfast was only being served for 90 minutes a day. Having said that, the food (when you could get it) was acceptable, and the workers did their best to cope with the crowd of irritated guests. The walls of the rooms are paper-thin, which provides no privacy and makes them very noisy. I could hear every word my neighbours were saying in their room. Also, the hotel's website says it accepts credit cards, but the agency I booked through told me I had to pay in cash when I booked.

But, the affordability of our accomodations (and the fact that the accomodations were clean and accessible), made us relax and enjoy spending $ on other things such as the theatre, amazing Indian restaurants, trips to Cambridge, etc. In summary, the Mentone is a good place if you're looking simply for an affordable place to crash.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cVery Basic But Well Located\u201d", "Author": "Cassowary", "ReviewID": "UR6127416", "Content": "This Hotel is very well located close to the Russell St Tube Station and just a little further from the Kings Cross Station. We are a family of 4 and booked a Quad Room - one tiny room with a double and 2 single beds. The room was serviceable and clean and we were surprised that our towels were changed daily. Full English breakfast was included and was served in the dining room by very helpful and friendly staff - the food was plentiful and enough variety was available to satisfy our picky children! The Hotel must be in a quiet area of town as we did not have any noise problems (not even traffic noise) on any of our 3 night stay. However, there were some things which were a little disappointing. Firstly, the beds are extremely uncomfortable - very hard and unyielding. The sheets are clean but show signs of wear. The other bed linen (duvet, quilt) were clean but worn and stained. The bathroom does not have an extractor fan and the knob on the cold water tap kept falling off. There was no bar fridge provided. Finally, while the meals staff were lovely, neither of the two Reception people we encountered were particularly friendly or helpful.", "Date": "November 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201ccan't go wrong for the price\u201d", "Author": "AJP-Tokyo", "ReviewID": "UR6013358", "Content": "Free wi-fi, breakfast included.

We had two rooms, just off the main stairwell, through a firedoor, and as they were the only two rooms there, it was like having a suite. In the daytime we could wedge the doors open (they faced each other) so we could keep an eye on the kids whilst still retaining some privacy of our own. In the night time we could lock their door and relax in the knowledge that they were only just across the small \"private\" hallway. The breakfasts have been written about before and we can confirm a 10/10 score here. One criticism, is that there was no place to leave your bags once you had checked out. Not really their problem I suppose, but most places have somewhere secure to leave your stuff if your flight is later on in the day. All in all, The Mentone is great for tube links, fairly central and the neighbourhood seemed really safe - the 24 hour Tesco is good as well. Oh and if you use the hotel's transfer from the airport ask for the Polish guy Matthew, a great bloke!
