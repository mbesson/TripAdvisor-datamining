The hotel is very quiet, but perfectly located for hundreds of bars and restaurants with a convenience store on the corner and the U-bahn passing almost outside the door for a quick trip in to see the sights of Berlin.

The particularity is that there is no reception desk but an intercom. The person in charge arrived one minute after we buzzed, gave us the parking card to park righ in front of the hotel, and gave us the key to the room. And that was the best surprise : huge bathroom, beautiful room with brand new furniture and fully equipped (fridge, corkscrew...). Concerning the location it is great : three U-Bahn stops from the famous Alexanderplatz (so you can travel with the discount short-distance ticket), rent-a-bike for 10 euros a day, safe neighborhood. I really recommend the place for an student-budget friendly romantic stay in Berlin !", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cRUN AWAY\u201d", "Author": "XRISTINA77", "ReviewID": "UR118438167", "Content": "I have visited Berlin several times but that was my first in Hotel 1A apartment. This time I wanted specifically to stay in Prenzlauer Berg since I was visiting a friend that stayed in the area and I wanted to be close. My reservation was about two double rooms for an eight night stay. Since there was not a 24 hour reception and I was arriving late at evening I had asked my friend to go in advance and collect the keys for the rooms. When the date arrived my friend went to pick up the keys but she came up with an unpleasant surprise. The hotel could verify just the one of the two reservations and they could give the keys for just one of the two double rooms. The incident happened just 2 hours before the departure of my flight. At the time my friend called me I was in the airport, about to check in. The hotel insisted that it was not their mistake but mine. I had to call booking.com, which was the provider of the room. Booking com had informed me that it was 100 per cent mistake of the hotel and they called the hotel to solve the problem. It was after 1 hour and several calls from booking com that hotel 1a apartment realize that they had lost the confirmation fax of my reservation. And it was after one more hour that they gave me a solution. Their first proposal was to put 2 extra beds and to have me share the second double room with my friends. Of course I refused so then they proposed me to go and stay in an other hotel in a double room with shared bathroom. No need to mention that my original reservation was about a double room with a private bathroom. After several calls they finally accepted to put me in an other-more expensive- hotel in the area. If I knew what I would have to put through I would have never made the first reservation. This hotel is totally unprofessional. I was truly lucky to have my friend there otherwise I would have arrived in Berlin around midnight and I would have been in a foreign city without a place to stay.

My room was really small, as was the bathroom - but both were tidy and everything well-maintained. My room was on the \"inside\" of the building, looking out onto a courtyard. Avoid a street-side room, especially on the first floor, which didn't look like it got a whole lot of privacy. There are several food options nearby and a great little shop a few yards away that had everything I needed (water, snacks). I felt totally safe walking around alone at night and the proximity to the train is great. The wireless internet was excellent. All-in-all I can recommend this as an option over staying at a hostel.

I usually dread staying in such places, as my idea of staying in a near-filthy room isn't exactly appealing. But how wrong I had been. This accommodation indeed turned out to be an excellent punt in all respects. Importantly, despite not being exactly within walking distance of the centre (took about 10 minutes by taxi to get back from Alexander Platz at 2am) it is superbly located only around 200m from the U2 underground line, meaning getting to the more central areas is a matter of less than 10 minutes. The area is extremely quiet, there is a supermarket (Kaiser's) located just opposite the flat, a 24-hour amenity store run by what seemed like a Turkish family 1-minute away down the road, and a big shopping mall (Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee Arcaden), cinema (Colosseum) and plenty of take-aways in the main road (Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee) nearby.
