Nearly two hours from the AIrport, but I was told that it was normally an hour. Free upgrade to a suite on the fifth floor which was fantastic, with a walk around balcony, Jacuzzi and loads of floor space. A Smoking room, but didn't smell of cigarettes so no problem. The Bar and restaurant was completely empty (on a Thursday) and completely devoid of atmosphere, but the meal I had was well presented, cooked beautifully and very reasonable. It's just a shame the drinks waitress managed to forget my drink even though I was the only customer in the Bar or restaurant. I'd have liked to go out to eat I think, but the weather was terrible, and so was the location (or at least felt like it). There's a minaret near (it's Istanbul after all), so unless you have earplugs or are a heavy sleeper, expect to be woken up by it at 6am.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "G\u00c3\u00b6teborg, Vastra Gotaland, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cNice health club and flexible staff\u201d", "Author": "Joel H", "ReviewID": "UR121249179", "Content": "Let's start with the bad: I will agree with other reviewers that the hotel is in a terrible location, and I had to point the way using Google Maps twice, coming by taxi from the airport. The rooms have quite a small TV (17\"?) with a very limited selection of English-speaking channels. I only found three, and of those, BBC World was unwatchable due to the bad reception. CNN & CNBC-E remained. So bring some movies on your laptop, if you are travelling alone. Now for the good sides. I've stayed here three times for business, due to proximity to customer, and the first time I got a very cramped single room (2014). No room for a desk, even. The second time, the room was bigger (1010) and had both an armchair and a desk. On my third stay, I was offered the small room again, but when I asked kindly for a bigger room, I was told that they were full out of singles so I was upgraded to a double! Plenty of space, and a sofa, at no extra charge. Very good service. The health club is not attached to the hotel, but located in the residential area behind it, quite close. The staff were happy to show the way. It is VERY well-equipped, featuring lots of workout machines and two indoor swimming pools and two outdoor ones, the latter closed during winter. There are also hamam and sauna facilities for both men and women. Concerning location, I would not say that there is NOTHING in the area. You can find some decent restaurants if you walk up the hill a few blocks, but nothing \"upscale\". Definitely worth it if you grow tired of the hotel menu, though. Two supermarkets and a small convenience store are within a one-block radius if you need refreshments. The area is quite safe to walk around, but watch out for speeding minibuses when crossing the busy street outside! There are three ATM machines across the street in case you forget to withdraw taxi money at the airport. The nearby Meyden shopping center has a food court with some more fast-food oriented fare. The breakfast has a fair selection of hot&cold Turkish cuisine, and a \"continental\" selection, but as is common in Turkey there is no ham or bacon. Plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit, though. Nothing spectacular, but nothing missing either. The room was nice and quiet, and I had few disturbances from the outside. AC unit was switched off during winter and would only cool. The room was very warm on arrival due to the towel dryer running full throttle. I had to use a philips screwdriver to turn it down, and the next day the room temperature was fine. I experienced no problems with room amenities or cleanliness, everything was up to my standard, but nothing was out of the ordinary either. The rooms have a modern design and are not too worn with use.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "AFO1", "ReviewID": "UR121150459", "Content": "Nice hotel, friendly and kind personnel, good and clean rooms, very good breakfast.

I was on a business trip but accompanied by my wife and our 3 month old boy. We enjoyed the hotel, but my wife got bored because there is nothing around the hotel. The rooms are very nice and spacious and modern. The service was good. The crib we booked was already in the room and everyone was very nice to the baby. There was a good buffet for breakfast. WiFi was included. The other amneties we couldn't really find or try out (where the heck is the pool you see on the homepage?) So nothing to complain about, but the only thing there is nothing to do around the hotel. You need a car to get anywhere, and all the places are really far away. The only thing close by is the Ikea with an attached shopping area. If you want to go to a nice restaurant you already need to drive more than 20 minutes. My wife wanted to go for a walk during the day, but this is impossible with a stroller. No pedestrians ways, a lot of traffic all around and as western you are pretty exposed in this area. So, good for business trips, but don't think about going to this hotel as tourist.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly good experience\u201d", "Author": "Giulia_London", "ReviewID": "UR68975629", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for two nights because it was close to the office.

Walking in is beautiful. It's a very nice hotel on the interior but unfortunately that is where the good impression ended. I stayed four nights only due to location to my customer, which was about a five minute drive and they pre-paid the room (80 euros). My problems started when I first got to my room and took a shower. The shower head did not stay fixed (a simple Phillips head driver could fix it) and the glass shower wall was leaking all over the floor. After a 20h trip, a long shower is nice. I was surprised when I stepped out int a large 4'x4' puddle of water on the floor. On top of this, the water had only two temperatures: freezing and skin-burning. Solution? Constantly switch the temperature back and forth while jimmying the shower head with a creative turn of the hose. I mentioned this in the morning and was told it would be fixed - never was. Next, after the shower, I turned on the AC at 3pm. It did not blow cold and did not cool the room below 23-25c - 75-80f. I powered through the night thinking it would get colder but I woke up at 3pm sweating with no blanket or sheet on me. I mentioned this to the reception in the morning and they said they would take care of it. They did not. Solution? Get another room key, put it on 10c and put the fan on high for the entire day. It worked - mostly! it took two days for the room to get below 20c. Lastly, my room, 4008, is a non-smoking room on a corner of the hotel. The rooms next door are smoking rooms. If you are a non-smoker, this room is not for you. Now, an experienced traveler would change hotels or rooms. I tried both. I was locked in to the hotel due to my customer and they would not change my room after two requests, citing that the issues were not issues and that they would be fixed, but they were not. I had really high hopes for this hotel and this is the first one I cannot recommend. I'm hoping my experience was a one-time thing and that others will have much better experiences here, as this is a nice hotel, but I'm not coming back and will stick to more well known brands like the Radisson, Hyatt, Hilton and Starwood properties.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "SvetoslavC", "ReviewID": "UR55478802", "Content": "Nice guys, parking valley, delicous breakfast,they had banitsa :D.
