You can also grab the Metro right there at Piazza del Popolo for the same 1 euro because the ticket is good for 75 minutes. Our rooms were clean, well kept daily, the beds were fine and the included breakfast is satisfying. The air conditioning was great and we certainly needed it during our trip.

Fabio, the day manager, was very helpful as were the other hotel workers. They have Internet access in the lobby which we used. My only suggestion would be for them to upgrade the computer and monitor to a more current system. The room television has many stations but only one English speaking channel (the BBC). I was hoping for CNN. Maybe next time. In Rome I would like to recomend that you visit the museum called Villa Borghese. It's wonderful.

The hotel is simple and clean. The staff were very friendly and all spoke good English. Our room (triple) was spacious. Although the hotel is located near a freeway and train track, it is very quiet at night after the last train at about 11pm. The best thing about Flaminius Hotel is its whisper-quite air conditioning unit which has a digital remote control allowing you to set the exact desired room temperature. The breakfast room is large and has about 10 tables. Breakfast started at 7am and included croissant, bread, cake, cereals, milk, coffee, juices, and even some tomato slices and green beans. The hotel\u2019s location is outside city of Rome but is on a commuter train route. From the Fiumicino Airport, you can take an express train to Termini (9.5-euro) and then change to Metro (1-euro) from Termini to Flaminio. Exit the Flaminio Metro station and get to the commuter train station next to it. The same 1-euro Metro ticket is good for the commuter train ride from Flaminio to La Celsa (about 10 train stops). After you get off the train stop, cross the street and walk in the same direction as the train on Via Frassineto for about 200 meters to the Hotel. Make sure you get off the train at La Celsa stop, not Prima Porta stop even though both stops are about 200m from the hotel. From the Fiumicino Airport you can also take the local train (5-euro) to Ostiense station and change to Metro Station Piramide (a short 5 minute walk with escalator). For a 1-euro Metro ticket, you can go from Piramide to Termini on Line B and change to Line A from Termini to Flaminio. Then exit Metro station at Flaminio to take the commuter train next door with the same Metro ticket. Ride on the commuter train for 10 stops until you reach La Celsa station. The airport express train will probably save you about 15 minutes. You can buy tickets for the airport train and Metro inside the airport train station and validate the Metro ticket later at a Metro station. It will take about 1 hour 10 minutes from the airport to Flaminius station. It will take another 30 minutes from Flaminius station to the hotel (5-10min waiting, 15min train ride, 5min walking). If you arrive at the Ciampino Airport, you can take a regional train first to Termini and then change to Metro to Flaminius and then to the commuter train to the hotel at La Celsa station. Another option is to take a bus to the nearby Metro Anagnina Station and then from Anagnina to Flaminius and change to commuter train from Flaminius to La Celsa. The same 1-euro Metro ticket will take care all the way.
