We checked in just before mid-night, but the innkeeper was extremely welcoming even insisting that he fill our ice chest with ice to chill our soft drinks. The room with a king bed and small table and chairs was basic and clean. The sink and dressing area was outside the bath/shower room. There was a flat screen tv. The doors were exterior doors, but I felt extremely safe. At stays in other properties in Branson, I have had concerns about the number of people who had access to our room, so valuables were left in the car. At this property, room access is limited, and I had fewer concerns regarding items left in room. Internet access was easy and speedy. The negatives about the Gretna Inn is that it is a \"work in progress\", and there are some kinks (as indicated in the previous review). However, I feel the innkeeper would have done their best to have corrected the problems reported by the previous reviewer had they been notified. The positives other than those already described is the daily rate and the convenient location. Our total charges for a five night stay was comparable to what we have previously paid for two nights. Considering this, we can plan trips to Branson more frequently. The property is located just off the main strip with easy access to main traffic corridors.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cOwners are very nice and helpful, staff very friendly, motel clean and convenient\u201d", "Author": "Cowboyup47", "ReviewID": "UR49655597", "Content": "The owners, the Hatfields, are both very nice and helpful.
