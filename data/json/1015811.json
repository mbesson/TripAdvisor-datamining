It feels like India which means that there are shops that sell traditional Indian clothes and jewelery as well as fruit and vegetables market and 24/7 shops and of course all kinds of traditional Indian restaurants on your every step. The hotel is located about 5-10 min walking from subway station. I saw workers painting the walls of some of the rooms so I guess they are renovating the rooms. Bathroom shower has no curtain so prepare to have flood in your bathroom every time someone takes a shower. They change towels and bed sheets daily. Breakfast is included in the price. They offer toast, butter, marmalade, eggs, bananas and coffee or tea. The staff was quite helpful.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSTAY AWAY\u201d", "Author": "The_Travelr", "ReviewID": "UR106663544", "Content": "This hotel is disgusting and tiny.

'Breakfast' the most appalling I have ever experienced - breakfast room cramped, smelly and noisy with no windows, a few scraps of bread, butter, peanut butter and jam, sad-looking blobs of scrambled egg in a tin, sachets of porridge for you to add hot water to, hot water seemingly hidden behind door so left people scrabbling to get to it. The bins were overflowing with plastic bowls and sachets from previous guests breakfasts.

The rooms are rather small and even the so called refurbished rooms show signs of age. If you are used to getting a comfortable temperature in the room by just dialing in the temperature, you will be in for a nasty surprise. The a/c doesn't regulate the temperature well. All said, the rooms are poor at best. The staff is generally helpful. The breakfast is minimal; just bread, jam, butter and eggs (if you get it before they run out). The hotel is quite close to the Little India MRT (< 5 min). The worst part about the hotel is the location. Next door is a pub where music is played very loud late into the night on most days. On weekends, it is practically overnight. Opposite to the hotel is a back packer's hostel and they also sometimes have music in the day. It could get Very Noisy. My colleague got a room away from the road and didn't have much issues with noise but the downside is that there is no window. Another thing is that over the weekends, the area around the hotel becomes sort of an open air bar with people sitting in groups on the sidewalks and drinking. They do not cause any problems but not many people would find it comfortable. As with all parts of Little India, this area becomes a Sea of people during the weekend. Again, there are no security or safety issues; just that the place becomes congested. On the whole, I wouldn't pick this hotel again. It would take a Lot of soundproofing to drown out the noise from the street and I don't see them doing it any time soon. Also, any savings in money would be more than offset by the loss of sleep and comfort. There is another hotel on the next street (Perak Hotel) which is a bit costlier but has a decent breakfast and much better rooms.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cGreat place if you like small, noisy places with hourly rates.\u201d", "Author": "ChimichangaFreud", "ReviewID": "UR34448745", "Content": "That's right, hourly rates.
