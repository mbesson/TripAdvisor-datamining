The location of this hotel is perfect - it is at Leidseplein, overlooking the canal, with 6 tram lines passing the nearby tram stop. The hotel is less than 10 mins away from the Amsterdam Centraal Station by tram and a short walk from the tram stop. Got a twin room facing the back of the hotel but it was okay - no problem with that as we just needed a room to sleep. The beds are comfy enough and the room clean. The toilet was a squeeze but that is to expect from most European hotel. It is clean though so I have no issues with that. One plus point about this hotel is that is has a lift! No way was I going to trudge up the narrow steep stairs with my luggage so I made it a point to search for hotel with lift at reasonable price and King Hotel fit my needs perfectly! Breakfast was okay though not much variety. Pretty basic but enough to fill you up. As I have dietary restrictions, I felt that the breakfast spread was good enough for me. Staff spoke English and were friendly and helpful too! Housekeeping kept our rooms tidy. When we arrived, our room was not ready so we asked to leave our luggage at the hotel while we grab some food nearby. Before leaving, we asked if there is a toilet in the common area and were directed to the 2nd floor to the tiniest toilet I've been in. It is like a 1-door closet, fits 1 person just nicely. This common toilet may be a tight squeeze for a plus size person though. Navigating inside the toilet was a challenge - what an experience! :) Anyway much to our relieve, our rooms were ready when we got back down to the reception so we checked-in first before heading out. For Muslims, there are a couple of Halal shops nearby so food is not a problem at all. Overall, a great stay in Amsterdam and King Hotel!

Tips:- the little advertising cards in a rack opposite the lift are useful for discounts especially the Canal Bus 24hr ticket which we used to travel all four routes to see the sights and museums. Unlike London where the permanent exhibitions at the main Galleries and Museums are free, Amsterdam Museums and Galleries charge a hefty amount for Adults which can make it a deterrent and I found it far more expensive than any previous visit and about 50% more expensive than Barcelona or Paris.

If you are planning to stay in this hotel I would advise that you do some research as to the exact location of the hotel before you leave. We didn't do this as I had been in Amsterdam twice before and had a rough idea of getting around so all we had was a printed off google map. Its roughly a 25 minute walk from Centraal Station. On arrival to the hotel, check-in went smoothly and the staff were friendly enough. Word of warning, look out for the ladder-like stairs in the hotel, i'm sure there has been many an accident on them! Like alot of Amsterdam hotels, King Hotel is small and basic. That was fine as it was all we required. As long as it was clean, which it was, then we didn't mind! The breakfast in the hotel was a basic continental breakfast but not bad at allHowever, there were two bad points about this hotel. The first being the water! The water that came from the shower had a terrible odour omitting from it. It was pure stagnant. Not nice at all. The second bad point wasn't really the fault of the hotel but there was a site that was undergoing constant construction at the back of the hotel. This started at approximately 7.30am every morning so you can forget about getting any sleep after this hour! The best point about the hotel was its location. It was situated in a lovely area full of nice restaurants and art galleries and without the intimidation of dodgy people that you might get in other parts of the city. It is about a 20 minute walk from the red light district so you can have the best of both worlds, the calm relaxed side and the wild mental side only a walk away! If the hotel sorted out their water, then i would definately recommend it to everyone as the basic package, nothing luxurious about it at all.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Dirty Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Frontrunner1", "ReviewID": "UR32953272", "Content": "Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here, its dirty, smelly and very unfriendly.

We were pleasantly surprised by the location, comfort, value and cleanliness of the hotel. Located on a canal and very near nightlife, tram routes, boat excursion stops, good eateries and bars, it was an ideal base for our long weekend. However, the reason I felt the need to review this hotel is the way the hotel staff, owners and local police officers reacted when our weekend turned bad. For still unexplained reasons the young girl with us suffered a serious reaction to either alcohol or accidentally inhaled substances. No-one in our party knowingly took anything other than lager the whole weekend. Despite this, she became extremely violent and vocal in the early hours of Sunday morning. When my son and I could no longer contain the situation the hotel staff came to my aid and called the emergency services. A team consisting of police officers and paramedics arrived astonishingly quickly and (at my request) took her to a nearby police station for a physical examination and to try and calm her down. At this point I would have quite understood the hotel asking us to leave bearing in mind the huge disruption the episode caused to the other hotel guests. I would also have understood the police presenting us with a bill for the doctors and officers who attended to her overnight. Suffice it to say I am very impressed with the care and attention we received from everyone involved during a very difficult night many miles from home.

Having visited Amsterdam several times now & tried a few hotels ranging from 3*-5* this was I am afraid to say the most disappointing hotel yet. We were looking for a cheap/long-weekend break in October so booked a double room here. Don't be fooled by the web pics of the rooms here. Thankfully we were only staying 3 nights & were too busy out enjoying ourselves all day & late into the night to be bothered ruining our holiday by complaining. The \"double???\" room we booked looked onto a nice courtyard. It resembled living in a cupboard. It would have been totally unbearable for a couple to live in this room for more than a weekend. If booked for a week we would have left! On opening the door...the double head-boardless bed was squashed hard up against the wall on one side & of course the door opened at the other side. Obviously this meant there was no room for bedside cabinets. There was no chest of drawers or storage in the room apart from a \"single\" MDF hanging wardrobe with only enough room to hang a couples jackets :-( & it had one small top shelf. This was between 2 adults on holiday! Obviously we had to keep all our clothes/underwear in our suitcases which we'd to constantly trip over to reach the sink as there was nothing big enough to put our suitcases on either. On going down to breakfast 1st morning, we were met with one available table which we could only describe as being left like a pig-sty by the previous people (not the hotel staff's fault). We sat perched on the end of the chairs & waited patiently for 15 mins before getting fed up waiting for someone to clear it so we moved to the next available table which was left cleaner. We'd then to ask the waitress for knifes and glasses, she'd to go and wash some as none were available. Also had to ask her to stock up on the self-service supplies ie milk and juice. Totally unorganised place. Heard others complaining about the bread & edges of cheese being hard. True. Similar problems the 2nd morning but thankfully the 3rd morning seemed far more organised, an older lady was on duty, with the young \"pleasant\" receptionist. 1 waitress seemed to be manning the reception at the same time as cleaning tables & loading the dishwasher. She seemed pleasant but the other young waitress on duty the 1st couple of days seemed totally fed up, dour and disinterested Our bedroom room was on the 1st floor & directly above the dining room. Therefore from early hours we were subjected to the constant noise of the heavy wooden chairs grinding off the ceramic tiles as people got up & down. As this room was situated on the 1st floor you also get the constant noise of everyone walking up & down the stairs, slamming the shared toilet & shower doors etc. It was unbearable. The noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in. Shower & toilet facilities were clean though. Thankfully as we were out at night until all hours so we missed the night noise that others have mentioned. probably as we were always last in at night ;-) (couldn't bear to be in that room haha). Ideal hotel for students, or just a place to put your head down. I certainly would not recommend it for couples and we certainly wouldn't return again. Rooms are clean but it's disgraceful advertising it as a double & charging double rates. A total rip off. Amsterdam is wonderful place, great fun & more than made up for the disappointing, substandard hotel. Try Grasshoppers Bar, fab place.", "Date": "December 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chepstow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood stuff!!\u201d", "Author": "Mrwurzal", "ReviewID": "UR4146358", "Content": "The story begins...... Friday 25th November me and 4 of my mates gets to the airport and jumps into an 8 seater (cost 35 Euro's) Direct to King Hotel.

We arrived at the hotel to a friendly welcome and booked in no problems at all all the staff very friendly! We then started the scary treck up the VERY STEEP STAIRS!! WARNING DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN OR IF YOU ARE NOT STEADY ON YOUR FEET! The stairs are very steep but as they are in all the Buildings in that particular area. The room. The rooms we were in was a twin and a triple ( i was in the triple) The room itself was not the Fantastic but what it was was a clean basic room with comfortable beds!! All we needed perfect for a 2 day stay! The shower room was good, clean and served the purpose, The breakfast was a typical COntinental style of a good standard (after we all drank them out of Orange Juice, Rehydration!! On the whole this is a very good hotel perfect locastion and very cheap! This isnt a classy hotel but really is PERFECT for a lads weekend and not really suited for families etc....

After all, we need to have unbiased reviews to guide us on our travels. As an exchange teacher, I wanted a hotel which was central and cheap for my 2 weeks off in early April. The King Hotel suited me fine. I had room #4, which was one step above street level and facing the canal. (You can see a picture of it on their website) It was a great room for a wonderful price. The tour boats drifted by, and the room had an exquisite ceiling with lots of Rococo work, and a fireplace which had a ledge to hold all of your souveniers. One double and one single bed. However, if you mind the late night screamer, this is not your room. You hear everything from the street. BUT, it is a quiet street. Rather unbelievable as it is just around the corner from the Liedesplein. Okay, so there a few rowdy Brits at 2PM, so what? It adds to the atmosphere. What I liked about the King Hotel was the security. It is an \"in and out\" hotel, if you know what I mean. I heard one poor soul trip on the steps at 3AM. However, they replace the plastic-holed computer room keys frequently, and you need a special key to get into the hotel and into your room. The stairs are steep. (But not to Room #4 which is only one flight of stairs) Breakfast can get monotonous after a few days...the good thing is they have boiled eggs (hot and hard) every morning. It appears to be run by Oriental people who are multi-lingual..quiet, polite and efficient. Received towels everyday, and sheets were changed when requested. If you're looking for the Ritz, this is not your hotel. However, I really liked it because it was good value for money and close to everything. The tram is around the corner...Boom Chicago and the Bulldog is a 4 minute walk around the corner. To find out where it is on the map, it is directly behind the American Hotel, which has excellent pea soup. I think people need to keep an open mind in Amsterdam...this hotel is one of those little canal establishments which is a delightful secret..'round the corner from the big boys, yet still scenic and pleasant. Yes, there are a few lager louts, but they come in late and don't make it to the 8-9:30 breakfast.", "Date": "April 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "italy", "Title": "\u201cking hotel\u201d", "Author": "manuelgat", "ReviewID": "UR3174348", "Content": "We are a young italian etero couple, king hotel did offer us a special rate then brought the price back to the origin and i had to call them back a dozen times to take evrything back to pacts, they put us in a really tiny room which was half space compared to all the other rooms in the hotel and the window was broken so we couldn't open it then the last three days even the heater broke, the worst fact is that a group of idiot german drunken guys did scream all night long for 3 nights and nobody told anything.
