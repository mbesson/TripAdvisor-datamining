{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Crazy experience (and not in a good way) We contacted the hotel upon arrival in Florence (9pm) to see if they had any available rooms. They did, and told us to come directly to the hotel. Unfortunately, when we arrived...there was no one there to answer the door. One of us went to call them again, but this time no answer. About 20 minutes later, we decided to give up and find another hotel. As we were walking away, an apparently very drunk gentleman yelled at us from down the street and asked if we were looking for Hotel Wanda. He apologized, took us upstairs and, despite being extremely intoxicated, attempted to tell us which rooms we could have. Although the rooms were very big, it was a bit dark and strange. We paid for one night and went out to have dinner. In the morning, we found that the continental breakfast from 8:30 to 10:30 was apparently no longer a reality. We found another hotel nearby, packed our things, and went to check out. The same gentleman was back at the reception, much more sober this time, but he had forgotten that we had paid him the night before. We had to search through our luggage for the little receipt he had given us in order to convince him that we had already paid. All in all, it was a creepy experience and not one that we would recommend.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR136422809", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Randy71"}, {"Content": "Little Gem Don't be dettered by outside of hotel wanda..once you get up the stairs it offers lovely spacious rooms with awesome paintings on the ceilings. Good location about 10mins walk to tourist areas. Little bakeries where you can purchase pastries for breakfast etc directly underneath hotel...so cheap!

However, when we arrived we were shown the 'wrong room' which was quite nice and then realising her mistake, the owner came back and moved us to a much lower class of room. This was not a good start. The room was large but dingy with pension-style furniture filled with old shopping bags from past clients. The shared bathroom was almost always dirty. Though the reception and hallway are nice, our room was not. There are plenty of nicer areas and, (as we found out during our long stay), nicer hotels in florence for the same money or a little more. Overall, it's not a bad hotel, and the first room we saw seemed pretty nice, but our personal experience of the hotel was disappointing.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR528171212", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great friendly little hotel Hotel Wanda is great - superb location, minutes walk from the attractions of Florence, but without the hefty price tag!We had an en-suite room which was airy and spacious, huge by European standards and excellent value for money.Don't be deterred by the street entrance, the hotel is on the first floor of a large building and there are other apartments in the building. But it's not a Pension, it is a hotel.Breakfast is basic, bread, pastries and coffee - but perfectly adequate. With so much to see and do in the beautiful town, you will want to be up and out as early as possible.Would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR291218943", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "martindude"}, {"Content": "Awesome Place to Stay This hotel was in a great location, about 15 minutes walk from the Duomo. The staff was friendy, although some spoke absolutley no English, so learn Italian before trying to communicate. The bathrooms were clean, the rooms were large and came with a balcony and a fan for those hot summer days. The only drawback was the early morning construction going on in the street, but we can't fault the hotel for that. In fact, closing the balcony doors blocked out most noise nicely. Overall, a great place to stay. I'd go back in a second.", "Date": "Aug 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR483642617", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sarahdreyfuss"}, {"Content": "Loved the Hotel Wanda This was really a great hotel, and had very reasonable prices. Despite that it was so close to everything, it wasn't in an area that was too touristy. The Hotel was literally walking distance from everything you would want to see in central Florence. The Bargello, Uffizi and Duomo were all a very short walk away. Also, there was a little farmers market very close to the hotel that was open in the mornings, which was really fun. The rooms were very nice, the hotel was clean, and the staff was friendly.
