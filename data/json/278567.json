Being a New Yorker, I was taken aback by the sincere hospitality of the staff. They went above and far beyond the call of duty. For example, Cathy, always made sure the dinner buffet was left out and still hot for us since our hours kept us late a work each night. This was not necessary nor expected, but terribly nice and so helpful. ROOM The KITCHENETTE in the room was perfect. Included a full-size fridge, full-size coffee maker with coffee, 2 burner electric stove top, microwave, sink with dishcloth and soap, and an array of dishes, pots, and utensils. The wine glasses and corkscrew were a welcome sight. The breakfast island with two tall chairs was the perfect place to bring back my buffet items and enjoy in peace and silence before I started each day. I could have used a small hand broom and dustpan on one occasion, but there was none available. The staff will even go grocery shopping for you if you leave a list at the front desk. Awesome. The king-size BED was oh so comfy with high quality sheets that I'm used to at home. The array of pillows was nice too. Although I didn't use the LIVING AREA much, the couch and chair were comfy (couch with a pull-out bed). The television was placed just so it could be seen from the kitchen, living area, and swiveled to view from the bed...perfection. The BATHROOM area contained a large closet (bigger than my NYC apartment) with sliding doors, a sink with a very large counter-top area and large drawers below that were handy for storing 10 days worth of personal toiletries. The shower and toilet were just off the sink/closet area which was nice for two to ready themselves without delaying the other. This area was very clean and well maintained (as was the rest of the room, however no one wants a sketchy bathroom). Also contained a hair dryer and the usual toiletries. The DESK/OFFICE area was located just inside the door and had wireless internet access. The desk was a \"normal\" size and more than I required for a 9 day stay. Some rooms have a gas FIREPLACE. Mine did not, but it would definitely be worth asking for when you reserve a room. The VIEWS are not what you stay here for. It's an industrial-like area by the interstate. RESTAURANTS There's a Le Peep, a Starbucks, and a bar/grill (good food) called Gatsby's a 2 minute walk away. There's also a Bob Evans just across the highway that could be walked to if you are careful, but driving is probably best. POOL/HOT TUB and FITNESS CENTER There was an indoor pool and hot tub although I did not utilize these amenities. They looked clean, inviting, and well maintained. I never saw the fitness center, but it was nice knowing it was there. BREAKFAST The breakfast buffet always had a nice selection. There were hot items like eggs of various recipes (a different one each day) including Eggs Benedict, Scramble, etc. with various toppings like cheese and salsa. Also there was a meat like bacon or sausage. Various breads, pancakes, waffles, fruit, yogurt, juice, coffee, muffins, cereal, and biscuits with gravy. There was definitely something for everyone. My only complaint (if you can call it that) was that I wished there had been an egg white option like a hardboiled egg. EXTRAS There was a mini snack bar by the front desk where one could find the usual candy, chips, and sodas, but also frozen dinners, canned soups, and ice cream. This was convenient for late night cravings. There's a Wal-Mart and a Target (2 different exits in two different directions) within a 10 minute drive of this lovely hotel. The \"breakfast area\" was quite large and contained a television and gas fireplace. This space hosted my colleagues and I one night for a raucous evening of cocktails and Catch Phrase. Downtown Indianapolis is about a 20 minute drive.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCompletely Average\u201d", "Author": "GHawg", "ReviewID": "UR126018974", "Content": "I travel quite a bit and always try to stay at Residence Inns. The Big 10 Basketball tourney was in Indy this weekend and I had to stay here as opposed to Downtown or Fishers. The room was overpriced, I pay $80 a night less for the same room at other Residence Inns. The front desk lady at check-in was wonderful, and everyone else was friendly, but not helpful. I was very disappointed with breakfast. Usually there is a varitey of foods, but not so here, the quantities and quality of what they did have was good, but I couldnt believe how few items they did have. There area isnt ideal, and we had to drive 6 miles for a decent meal. If you plan on eating out while here, bring your GPS or iPhone you will need it.

I've stayed here in the past and returned because of the staff, and great service. My business associate ended up sick during the stay, and the staff took care of him, making sure he was comfortable. Not many places will do that, but they went above and beyond. The staff are what make or break a place, and with their hospitality, it is well worth staying there. The breakfast, as well as the evening meals were good, and the chef there made sure people were happy with what they had to offer. Although it did need a facelift, that wouldn't prevent me from staying there again. With todays economy, not many properties can afford the costly facelift, so the staff makes up the difference, by offering great customer service. The property was clean and comfortable, and that is what I look for in a hotel. Would I stay there again? Yes, and I wouldn't hesitate recommending this property.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201c62 on priceline\u201d", "Author": "richety", "ReviewID": "UR120254043", "Content": "Overall ok, but seems dated inside and doesn't seem the cleanest", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bowling Green, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cA Little Disappointed and Sad\u201d", "Author": "nvky", "ReviewID": "UR119151586", "Content": "We have been staying at this Residence Inn every year (sometimes twice a year) since it opened in 2003. It has always been my favorite Residence Inn and our stays have always been good. That being said, this year it was different. We stayed in Sept for 6 nights and again in Oct for 3 nights. The Property is getting a little weathered and is in BAD need of a remodel. Furniture, carpet, wallpaper, drapery, appliances, it all needs replacing. Bed was still comfortable but the pillows were flat and completely worn out. We had different rooms for each visit and they both did have a strange odor. (Housekeeping seems to be overlooking a lot of things that should be addressed) On our first visit the evening meal and the breakfast buffet was a joke. There was a family staying there that emptied every dish and there was never anything left for anyone else.(They never missed a meal) ( One woman took 4 big cinnamon rolls and put them in her purse) (Another family member Filled a cereal bowl full of chicken tenders) I eat alot, but that seemed a little extreme- even to me. The quality of the breakfast on the second visit was very poor until Sunday morning. (Eggs were like they had sand & ocean water in them the first two mornings) We had to eat elsewhere. This makes me SAD to write a bad review because this property used to be top notch. Not sure if we will stay here again until it is remodeled.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClean, friendly, big rooms, what a great hotel!\u201d", "Author": "thriftynp78", "ReviewID": "UR118541684", "Content": "I cannot say enough nice things about this hotel.

The 2nd morning everything ran out and the girl that was \"suppose\" to be replenishing was still cooking stuff in the back and she looked like she just crawled out of bed too.

Much of my previous review is still applicable. This hotel is good for business travelers who need to be in the area. It is located in an industrial area with few attractions nearby. The nearest grocery store is approximately 2 miles away. I would not recommend it for visitors who want to experience the culture of Indianapolis. It provides a good value in the form of a free continental breakfast, large rooms, free evening appetizers, and decent amenities. The continental breakfast provided hot items like eggs and sausage, as well as an assortment of cereals, breads, yogurts, fruits, coffee, and juices. My room was located on the third floor, very large, clean, and quiet. I did not eat any of the evening appetizers. The pool was decent-sized. The gym had two treadmills, an elliptical, exercise bike, and crunch bench, but no disinfectant or cleaning supplies, which made me question the room's hygiene. There was a computer for internet access in the lobby, but the connection was very slow. WIFI was available The service was hit or miss. For the most part, the employees were friendly and accommodating. However, one female in particular seemed more interested in fraternizing with the male maintenance employees than providing service to the customers or hotel. I also saw some of the maintenance employees browsing the internet from the lobby computer. I would stay here again for the hotel's value and the Marriot rewards program.
