One of our rooms were ready and the other wasn't, so the friendly employee parked our car for us and took our bags to the available room. Didn't bother us a bit, we were ready to go out and play anyway :)... When we came back, the 2nd room was ready and we got settled in. We each had a King room. Perfect size for 2 people. Everything was clean, cable TV worked great, refrigerator was a wonderful touch, coffee maker was my lifesaver in the mornings! No complaints whatsoever about our rooms - we weren't in them much, they served their purpose, plenty of space for us, clean, and nice functioning amenities. The rooms are cleaned daily and you are given fresh new linens, towels, etc. Breakfast is complimentary - you have a little sheet and you're given options to choose from and you choose around what time you want your breakfast delivered to your room, along with a free newspaper every morning. Lovely little touch; I really enjoyed that. The pool area was nice and clean. We swam on the 2nd night and it felt great to cool off from walking in the sun all day long. (The pool is a saltwater pool, by the way). There is an ice machine and a Coke vending machine in the courtyard also which was super convenient for us. Our rooms were located on the first floor, close to the street and at times we could hear street walkers talking or music or the clacking of the buggy rides, but we didn't mind. This is New Orleans - soak up the sounds!!! The location is perfect. One block from Decatur (MS River), just a VERY short walk down the street to Jackson Square and St. Louis Cathedral, and 2 blocks from Bourbon Street. Awesome, awesome, awesome location! We felt very welcome and safe and secure at all times. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and helpful.

They gave us the choice of 4 hotels that had vacancies but it is difficult to find them even though the french quarter is only a few blocks square but they are all on one way systems so we ended driving by it and then circling round again. We were pleasantly surprised at the cost of a King room (under $200 for 2 nights) and the room was just great, lovely soft bed own little balcony through the french doors, in fact the only thing we did not like was the attitude of some members of staff, we did not realize that if we required breakfast around the pool area we still had to put the notice on the door saying we wanted breakfast. The lad said he would get us breakfast but I should not forget his tip for doing this, being typically British we do not tip when people ask for tips so he was very rude, we then got our breakfast and I had a dirty cup so I asked the young boy to change it and he just swilled it under the tap so I did not bother with the tea next day the cups were not clean so we we went to a cafe and had tea and coffee there. but please do not let this little hiccup stop you from stopping at what is a very nice Hotel with very clean rooms and charming people on reception and the boy who parked our car was a very nice lad who was very helpful- be aware though that you cannot just park your car anywhere as they strictly enforce the parking due to the narrow streets. just a little info on New Orleans, the main street where all the entertainment takes place is Bourbon street and they have some very good entertainers along the street to stand and watch but also down one end there are some seedy places offering less than a welcome for families (if you know what I mean!!) but again bearing in mind some people want that sort of thing. The one thing I would say is find this little restaurant called \"GUMBO SHOP\" on Saint peter street as this does what we thought was some of the best Gumbo food which of course is a must to try when in New Orl. along with the Cat fish. Lastly we had a ride on the Steam boat \"Natchez\" 2 hours on a steam paddle boat was well worth the $25 each we paid and they did not rip you off for drinks etc on board. all in all I really do think the Chateau Hotel was one of the best we had stopped in as we traveled across America.

This was our first trip to New Orleans. I did a lot of searching, reading reviews, and of course checking out tripadvisor. Well, we decided on Chateau Hotel for several reasons: it was central to everything, had old charm, was medium range priced, and the reviews were good and where they were not the hotel management explained why and how the concerns were handled. Well, we just got back and had an amazing time. Dan at the front desk made us feel welcome the minute we walked in the door, and so did the bell hops, etc. Our room was beautiful, well appointed and spacious. The hotel itself is very French Quarter, unique, has a beautiful pool, and a nice continental breakfast which was a great start to our mornings. Here are our notes and tips. If you can, ask to be housed in the main set of buildings. If you like the nightlife and noise - choose an outer room, if you want a little more quiet and privacy - go for the 2nd level or inside on the courtyard facing into pool. They have a 4 room building acorss the street which we were housed in, I would have much preferred the other main building although our room was beautiful. We faced to the street and across from us was a 24 hour neighborhood bar - excellent Bloody Mary's. But it did get busy and noisy so we never opened our shades. Another thing, I think since the ventilation and air conditioning was added later (historical building) we would get cigarette smoke circulating into our room from time to time from one of the other rooms. It did bother us the smell never saw any smoke FYI. The front desk brought in a large deodorizer which helped some. And, when the A/C kicked on it dissipated it as well. So, if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room or have allergies to smoke - I wouldn't stay in this room - 156. Other than that - we loved it. I wore earplugs for 2 nights just to make sure I could sleep, my girlfriend did not wear any and she slept fine as well. I think noise level will vary based on the week you are visting i.e. festivals, and the night life. This truly was a perfect spot. We walked all over town (would not recommend a car - do not need it). We walked to Riverwalk Shopping center and Aquarium, the edge of downtown and Harrahs, along the pier, to Bourbon Street, all over the French Quarter, walked to dinner to both Broussard's and NOLA, and walked down to the big park with the museum buildings but I don't remember the name of the park (I think Armstrong). I highly recommend Chateau Hotel. NOLA was awesome, food was great at Broussard's (old fashion charm), Cresent City Cooking was great, and highly recommended www.Strayboots.com for walking scavenger hunts that take you through the history and sites of New Orleans. We will be back. Our trip couldn't have been better. Oh and take the taxi to and from airport - best way to go rather than the van to hotel. Traveled April 20th to the 23rd, 2012. Some fun notes - Cafe Du Monde was excellent and a fun stop, St. Louis Cathedral a must, Cafe Maspero - best Bloody Mary's, Coyote Ugly - great/friendly people and they had a free Crawfish boil while we were there (it was huge), great artictic places to stop and shop, cooking class at Cresent City Cooking should be a must, and just walk around as much as you can. What a wonderful city, but beware when walking around - the streets and sidewalks are old and riddled with cracks, dips, holes, etc. And, the life is eclectic and at sometimes very sad (poverty). Hotel Mgmt. - You need to look at the toilet in this room - it wobbles from the wall, the night table between the two beds needs a leveler on one foot, and the smoke issue - other than that perfect (these are just small maintenance issues). Oh, and I am mailing your keys too.

First was in November 10', for our 20 year anniversary. My husband or myself had never been to NOLA, and just happened upon the place online. We had an awesome balcony room, very clean, old, but clean. The old is to be expected, it's NOLA and it's a historic area. The balcony view was awesome, even caught a great view of a wedding coming by. Perfect!! Staff was very friendly and helpful, they did recommend some tourist info, but never felt like I was being pushed to go there. Temperature was never an issue. It's the south so of course we used the heat and air cond, during the same weekend. Our second trip we made with another couple, we had adjoining rooms in the courtyard area, near the pool. Rooms were very nice, we were able to open the adjoining door and visit with our friends, during the brief times we were in the room. The only issue we had, was with the air conditioning in our friends room, which quit on the second day we were there. This trip was in August 11\" so it was sweltering. The hotel was full on this day, and another room was not available until the next day, so we opened our adjoining door and let the cool air in during the day so it wasn't totally unbearable at night, and the hotel moved them in a new room for our last night there as soon as it was vacant. No problems, at all even adjusted the price. The funny thing was they were given the exact room my husband and I stayed in on our first trip. Again the staff was very friendly, not overbearingly so but friendly. Offered advice on places to eat and site seeing. The hotel is great for us, guess it depends on what you are looking for.

The courtyard is also very nice. I stayed at the hotel in February 2012 with my husband for four nights. The first night we were given a room (# 115) at the street level, with no possibility of opening the windows, which is quite common in the French Quarter, due to the structure of the houses and safety reasons. However, the bad part was that, since the windows did not have clear curtains, but only thick ones, in order to enjoy our privacy, we had to have the thick curtains pulled, so the room was completely dark and we could not enjoy any natural light. Also, the only way to change the air in the room was to have the main door open, which, again, meant to have no privacy whatsover. This kind of room should just not be sold, not in these conditions, until they provide it at least with some clear curtains, that allow natural light to come in while still enjoying the privacy one expects in a hotel room! The kind gentleman at the reception changed our room the following day, and gave us one with balcony. This time we had plenty of light, fresh air and privacy. The room itself had a great potential, but the old carpet, curtains and towels and the its smell of old took a lot away from what could otherwise have been a very pleasant stay. What a pity! When we checked out, the Reservation Manager took only $20.00 off the final bill, after I complained about the first night, and explained that some previous guests had ripped off the clear curtains in the room we had gotten the first night. How does it really take to replace curtains? The gentleman that was at the reception the last two days also does not seem to be the right person for this kind of client-oriented job.

Part 2 is off to another activity and lunch - then back to the room for the whole resting of the feet/restroom thing. Part 3 is dinner & nightlife and then back to the room to sleep. So the Chateau Hotel is perfect for this type of traveler ... someone who just needs a home base. Upsides: They let me check in at 9AM because my room was vacant. Major plus! The front desk is friendly and informative. They have a free continental breakfast and get this - if you're too lazy to go down & get it, you can fill out a card and hang it on your door knob and they'll bring your selections to your room at the time you indicate on the card FREE. Loved this! They have free ice, in-room refrigerators and a soda machine onsite. Beds passed my thorough bed bug inspection (sheets, mattress, box spring, mattress cover, pillow cases, etc.).Overall, I felt safe here. Downsides: OMG, noisy! The staff slams stuff around in the halls and in the courtyard at all hours of the day & night. Flapping garbage bags, vacuuming, squirting sidewalks, squawking on their walkie-talkies/cell phones, and other sounds that I couldn't identify. The paper boy drops the newspapers at each doorway at 5AM ... thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump. The TVs are from the early 70s and include the static problems of that era too at no extra charge. The water pressure is equal to that of a kinked hose and the rooms have that \"we used to let people smoke in here\" aroma. No temperature controls - you have to go their preferences on this. Bottom line: Hey, I paid $89 a night. I got a killer location and a place to store my crap and rest my head. That's more than fair.

It seemed fine when we checked in, but then the bellman led us to a door on the street that opened up into our hotel room. I would have never guessed a hotel room was behind the large door/shutters. The room itself was fine, however being 23- and 24-year-old women in a strange city, we felt a little vulnerable. It was rather loud between all the drunken relevry from nearby Bourbon Street, passing pedestrians and horses' hooves clopping on the street. One night when we were getting ready to go out to bars, a passerby banged on our door and scared us. I guess they were drunk and heard girls laughing behind the doors. Because of that incident our first night, it scared us when one of the employees banged on our door because we hadn't picked up our complimentary breakfast in the lobby. When he knocked (if you could call it that), he didn't announce who he was. So we hesitated before opening the door. He said that they had called our room phone and we hadn't picked up. Then we checked the phone and it wasn't plugged into the wall, which was even less reassuring in the case of an emergency given our location on the street. On the second morning of our stay, we also had a rude encounter with an employee. The maid failed to leave a card to hang on the door requesting breakfast, so we picked one up in the office after we woke up. The receptionist told us to fill it out and hand it to a man working off the courtyard. When I approached him and asked him if it was too late to have him prepare breakfast, he repiled \"I don't need any attitude.\" I was being polite, so that caught me off guard. My friend and I both pointed out that we were merely asking and not giving him attitude. I am a New Yorker and thought that was a pretty rude! We stuck around the courtyard for a few minutes and he brought out our breakfast right away and was polite then. Maybe he was just having a bad morning, but it really caught both my friend and I off guard. If it wasn't for the location of our room, I would have been satisfied with our hotel stay.

The outsides of the building(s) were beautiful!! We were all super excited when we got there. The room wasn't anything write home about, but we didn't spend a lot of time in the room, so it worked fine for us.

Your breakfast will be up in about 10 min, TIPS ARE APPRECIATED.\" Needless to say, we were not happy about that. I called down and asked if I could pick up our breakfast (we didn't want to tip someone that tells you to tip). We were allowed, but told to bring everything back to the kitchen when we were done.

I decided on this hotel because I wanted to stay in that part of the Quarter, closer to the Marigny area. And the location was perfect as Frenchman St was just a short walk away, but I was still close to Jackson Square and Bourbon St. This is not a 5 star/high class hotel with a bunch of amenities. If this is your style, then this hotel is not for you. Yes, the hotel could use some updating, but if you want good value for money, the Chateau Hotel is a fine choice. I had a queen bed room with a shared balcony over looking the courtyard. The room was small in the sense that their wasn't a lot of floor space, but it didn't feel small because of the very high ceilings. The bathroom was a good size, and felt even larger because of the wall to wall mirror. They have pedestal sinks which look very nice, but aren't practical for a hotel because there is no counter space. I ended up putting a towel on the toilet lid to use as a counter. Small annoyance, but manageable. My room also had no bathtub, just a large built in tile shower. The rooms do have small fridges, which is a big plus for me as a lot of hotels do not offer fridges anymore (or charge you more for your room to have one), but they had it in the closet. I mentionned that there wasn't a lot of floor space in the room, but the fridge could still go in the room without being in the way. I thought that very strange. The staff was very nice, and the courtyard is very pretty and has that New Orleans charm. They have a small pool which is great to cool off on a warm, humid day. The hotel doesn't have any individual safes or safety deposit boxes, but you may use the hotel safe. You put your items in a sealed enveloppe and they put it in the safe for you. The hotel also offers a continental breakfast which you can have delivered to your room or eat out in the courtyard (there is no breakfast room). You need to place your order the night before and indicate what time you want your meal. A person doesn't always know what time they'll get up the next morning when they're on vacation (especially in New Orleans), but the breakfast is appreciated. They offer a choice of toast, english muffin or muffin, with tea/coffee and juice. Overall, it was a pleasant stay.

You really cannot get a better location in the French Quarter that is convenient to all of the major attractions and the Frenchman St. Marigny clubs as well; you can easily walk to every club you want to go to. I was on a trip home to visit family and chose this hotel to stay at for my visit. The room I had was typical for a hotel of that age in the FQ as far as size goes; in other words my room was not spacious, but again, rooms in any other FQ hotel of the same age are not spacious either. If you want a large room stay in one of the tower monstrosities that have sprung up on Canal St. in the past 20 years. But why would you want to stay at one of those, you can stay at one of those in your own home town, so if that is what you prefer stay home. One of the things I like about the hotel is the scale of it. It's only two stories tall, so no elevator, one can move around in the hotel very easily. One flight of stairs and you are on the street, or in the pool, no long walks. I once stayed at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and hated it because it took at least 20 mins to get from my room to the street. A hotel can be too large. The room was clean and had a nice shower, no tub, but I do not use a tub and was glad that I did not have to step into a tub to take a shower. The TV was on the small side, with a minimum of channels, but I wasn't on vacation to watch TV. Breakfast was served every morning along with a copy of the Times-Picayune. I took my breakfast downstairs in the patio, the coffee was very good. The continental breakfast is nothing to rave about, but I have yet to have a continental breakfast in a U.S. hotel that is worth raving about, in that regard the Europeans are way ahead. But really, who cares, if you want breakfast you are in the FQ, just walk down the street, there are plenty of restaurants around. The best quality about the hotel is the staff. If you come to New Orleans remember this, people here will talk to you; its the norm, and if you speak to them you will get to know them and that makes all the difference in the world when staying in a small hotel where you will see the same staff day after day. Remember this too, nothing says hello like money. When you are served breakfast give a tip, when you go out leave a tip for the maid cleaning the room. Tipping is part of the culture in New Orleans; we tip everyone, and everyone expects a tip, and people will respond in kind. In New Orleans it is customary to give someone a little something extra, we even have our own word for it; lagniappe. I was traveling alone on my visit home, I left $2 for the maid, and $2 for breakfast everyday, that's $4 a day, not much at all, but it makes a difference to the staff. It also makes a difference to say \"good morning\" or respond in kind when someone says it to you. Treat the staff as your peers and with courtesy and you will have a pleasant stay I promise you. Parking: the hotel has offsite valet parking. I never used it because I flew into New Orleans and did not rent a car. No need for a car if one is staying in the FQ. But for those who drive to New Orleans or rent a car all I can tell you is that during my stay at the hotel I never heard anyone complain about waiting for their car to arrive once it was summoned. The bottom line is this, would I stay at this hotel again; yes. There are only four hotels in the FQ that I will stay in, and this is one of the four.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cLove it.\u201d", "Author": "luv2travel3131963", "ReviewID": "UR115940836", "Content": "After much research I chose this hotel in the French Quarter for the pics of the rooms.

Most of the stay it was actually cooler outside than in the room. The vents were blowing air, however it was not cold air. They gave me the lame excuse that they were in the middle of a bizarre heat wave and that is why the air conditioner could not keep up. To bad for them, I am from the area and my husband and I like to visit the French Quarter often. There is no difference in the current heat to that of the years passed. Also, please note all of the previous review entries and their complaints of the heat, along with management's comments that they have so called \"fixed\" or \"addressed\" the problem. It is a LIE. The front desk staff was rude, actually telling me at some point to please stop calling the front desk because the temperature could not be fixed. Not once did they offer me a better room, a discount, free parking, a coupon, or anything for that matter. Not even so much as a fan was made available, even after I requested one, I was told that they did not provide fans. When I called the front desk and asked them to call a cab for me for 7:30 p.m. for a dinner reservation, or to provide a contact number so that I could do so myself, I was told that it was to hard to get a cab on Saturday night and that if I still needed one I could walk the 2 blocks to Decatur Street and \"attempt to hail one myself.\" We get much better treatment at the Quality Inn on O'Keefe, for $40 less a night, and a working air conditioner, which is where we usually stay. Upon check out, I was not asked how my stay was, if we enjoyed our trip, etc., NOTHING, I was simply told what amount was due for our room and told that I could walk across the street and ask for my car because the \"radio batteries were dead\" and the grumpy old man at the desk was not allowed to leave post.

It used to be an average/cheap place with a great location, a little quirky, but it seems times have changed, and not for the better at Chateau. The last time we stayed here (April 2011) there were too many things that disappointed us. Some of these things could be overlooked, but all together made for a not great experience. 1) They advertised free Wifi - but sadly, the wifi was unusable, had to go to local coffee shop to do business. 2) Parking is expensive and right across the street - which would be fine if the desk guy would radio for your car for you. He said he would, but 20 min later, no car came. We walked across the street and told the valet guys which car was ours and they drove it 12 feet to us - they said the desk guy doesn't know how to use the radio and that happens all the time. 3) They assigned us the loudest, smallest room (115 right across from the office) - this could happen to anyone, someone has to stay there I guess. 4) Room dirty, wallpaper peeling, broken mirror, towels not exactly white. 5) We left 4 items of clothing in the closet and remembered when we got home (the same day). We called and they said they found the clothes and told us to send them a check for $12 so they could mail the clothes to us. We did right away. 3 weeks later we received a beat up box of clothes that were not ours. I called and explained to the desk guy who told me to call the next day, i did, then he told me to call on Thursday, which i did. He then told me that they didn't have our clothes. (???) What the heck is going on at this place? They didn't offer to refund the shipping $ we sent to get our stuff back either. 6) If you're still reading, this is the worst of all. This hotel still uses metal keys, which is fine, except: My husband went back to our room to grab a beverage, he opened the door... only to realize that he was in the wrong room. Mistakenly he entered the room next to ours, using our key. So are all the keys the same? Huge security problem for me.

The walls and ceilings were stained. It's not the kind of room that puts you in a happy or romantic mood, in fact, it put me in a bad mood.

This makes this bedroom a little loud, but it's a relatively quiet street and for a long weekend no real bother. The other bedroom was up in the loft, so not completely private but much quieter. For 4 nights we stayed for approximately $100 per person a night. Given all the space we had, we couldn't have asked for a better deal. Our breakfast was brought to us each morning, thus allowing us to enjoy it out on our balcony.

This was verified upon meeting him - the TV programme he never took his eyes away from , was obviously of more importance to him than our booking. Because of the lack of accommodation in the hotel, we were warned that our room was windowless - and less said about it the better although I will say that it was contained in an annex room that opened directly onto the street. as we, and one poor dear lady, found to her cost! The weather was qppalling and the only area for breakfast was outside in the inner courtyard which would be charming in the sunlight but quite disasterous in the middle of a rainstorm. The breakfast woman was less than helpful, considering we had no idea what we were supposed to do in these circumstances and her attitude was aggessive and offensive. In spite of breakfast being included, we only ate there once more when we were assured she wasn't on duty! Confrontation is the last thing you need on your yearly holiday. It was with some relief, therefore, that the front desk rota changed, and we met Lillian - a pure joy of a lady, who smoothed things out for us, transferred us to a far better room with balcony, as soon as it was available and proffered local advice on where to go and what to eat. We found the cleaning staff to be happy and chatty but they are not the Public face of the Chateau hotel, after all. All in all , the Chateau suffers from lack of obvious management structure, a lack of management interest and a sense of hostile hospitality, apart from the exception of the dear lady in Reception..

We went to sleep roun midnight only to be awaken by the phone call round 2:30am. there was nobody on the phone so we thought it was a prank. however, a minute later there was a bang on the door - bell boy was waiting on the street in front of our room. We couldn't beleive that the hotel would wake us up at 2:30 in the morning. I call the reception and again without an apology I was explained that the thermometer for all 4 \"lovely room\" was convenietly located above my bed and that it needed fine tuning at this hour.

Next day we were angry at the concierge - again no apologies. However after screaming at him we got different room for the second night. Since we took a tourist trip to the swamps, we came late that day (5pm) and were accused by the concierge that we were getting back to him for what they did to us the first day - we had to take our stuff to the other room and they were expecting us to do so at 11 am (!) so that they could rent our \"lovely\" rooms to some other poor plonker.

I wasn't thrilled to see such extreme reviews - either really negative or really good. After staying there for 2 nights, now I know why. Night 1: We checked in with our friends and were given rooms 108 and 109 on the Chartres side of the hotel. We each had a wall facing the street. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because it wasn't near any major bars, any restaurants and was in a fairly quiet looking area of the quarter. However, at night we could hear the horse-drawn carriages going by every hour and the tour guides going through their scripts. We could hear people having loud conversations pretty much all night long and then there was the 6am trash pickup, the hour long dog barking before the owner finally shut it up and the hammering by a neighbor at o'dark thirty in the AM. None of us got a good night's sleep and were miserable. Night 2: We asked for a new room since the first one was so terrible and got rooms 241 and 239. These rooms were much better and were nothing like the rooms we had the first night. We had hardwood floors, brass four-poster beds and a sitting area. The bathroom was much larger and we had a dry bar with a mini fridge. The beds didn't have a sink hole in the center and we couldn't hear any street noise so all of us got a good night's sleep. The difference in these 2 sets of rooms was like night & day! Now I know why some people put such horrible reviews about it and why some thought it was great. When booking here, be sure to ask for an interior room, one that doesn't have a wall facing Chartres or St Philip. When we checked in, the desk attendant wasn't very friendly, but the person we met that had the night shift was very pleasant. They offer breakfast which we took advantage of only once and it was pretty standard, nothing special but did the trick. The dish TV doesn't get great reception, but you don't usually spend too much time watching it anyway. The shower pressure even varied between the two rooms, 239 and 241 had better water pressure. You can't book online and have to send them a check for the first night and wait for a confirmation to be snail-mailed to you since they won't take a credit card for reservations, although you can pay with a credit card upon arrival. It's close to everything in the quarter and there's a quaint 24 hr pub about a block away that's pretty quiet and they offer nightly ghost tours.

They said there was some street noise, but not enough to wake you. Our room was comfortable, king bed (lots of pillows), love seat, and desk with chair.

A small refrigerator was under the desk. The courtyard area outside the room was wonderful. The breakfast is served at a bar in the courtyard in the morining. It was so nice to sit at the little tables and read the local paper (provided on the doorstep quite early), and sip coffe. The breakfast is just coffee, juice, and pastries, but was adequate to get me going. The pool is lovely for a quick dip, but not big enough to actually swim. It was clean and cool. The courtyard has an exit/entrance to the street so you don't have to come/go through the lobby. That was nice. They secure the gate at night, so very safe. A BIG PLUS with this hotel besides the location is the FREE parking! It's in a gate secured lot across the street. We went in and out several times very easily. The other good thing is the help.
