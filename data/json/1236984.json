I understand these things happen, however it is still annoying - if you want a pool do check that any renovations are finished. - There is a construction site next door. Not a small one either.

One thing struck me as a bit odd. On checking in, they wanted a HK$3000 deposit to cover additional charges for the two rooms, and as I didn't have cash they asked for a credit card.

My \"City View\" room had enough space for a couple and the quality of the in-room amenities was good. Room came in a funny rectangular shape, long and narrow, a little strange at first sight but in the end space was enough. At the 8th floor, the view from our room was blocked by the buildings around and we did not have any \"city view\". All rooms face a quite busy street and we could hear the traffic noise since the early hours in the morning. For lovers of cool features, the bathroom has a \"magic glass wall\" that you can switch from glazed to translucent allowing to see through the glass into the bedroom. I guess this feature is supposed to allow city view across the room while showering, quite useless in our case per what said above. As noted in previous reviews, the hotel is not really in Causeway Bay but, past Victoria Park, in Tin Hau. I believe the area formally belongs to Causeway Bay therefore the indication is not formally misleading but, per what is common understanding, the hotel would be more properly said \"close to\" rather than \"in\" Causeway Bay. That did not bother us at all and as a matter of fact we enjoyed the location, in a lively neighbor with shops and eateries, just at a short walk through the park to Causeway Bay and with easy access to public transportation, whether subway, tram, bus or taxi. As mentioned, the neighbor is full of eateries, from local Cantonese to other Asian cuisines (plenty of Japanese) to western and we did not bother having any meals in the hotel. All in all, we were satisfied with the choice; the hotel is not exiting but the quality was ok, with the only negative worth mentioning being the street noise that at the 8th floor gave us wake up calls every morning.

You know how tiny hotel rooms generally are in Hong Kong? Even with the double bed, I could still literally do somersaults in the room! Then there was the in-built bathtub in the bathroom, which came with the magic shower glass (which fogs up eventually, whether you turn it on or not). The hotel is located three blocks away from Tin Hau MTR station, which is just one stop away from the ever-bustling Causeway Bay, easily accessible from the airport via the airport express, than the free shuttle H2, which stops right outside the hotel. Most of the time, I got around via the tram/ train: 1. If you are looking to go/ return from Causeway Bay (SOGO/ Times Square), do take the tram with the ShauKeiWan/ Happy Valley sign. Turn right upon exiting the hotel, walk straight all the way, and cross the road to get to the tram station. It gets you to/ back from Causeway Bay in no time, beats walking to the MTR station, taking the escalator and train waiting time in all. 2. Bus #10 across the street (also turn right upon exiting the hotel, walk straight and cross road) gets you to Admiralty and Central MTR station. Got a double bed, which was actually just two single beds put together, so half the time I was asleep, could feel the uncomfortable centre gap, oh and my toes were sticking out the bed (I am slightly over 1.7m). That said, you probably want to put in a request for a \"longer\" bed if you are over 1.75m. Also, there are convenient stores, a frozen yogurt store and decent eating places just around the corner, no more than a five-minute walk from the hotel, a plus point if you do not feel like venturing out. Got my three nights' stay at the hotel at a pretty reasonable rate, however, the hotel staff needs to work on its service attitude. Also, when I had made enquiries about the free shuttle to the aiport express station, they had assumed that I wanted to book the direct airport transfer (comes every hour, do check with the front desk the night before you are leaving), which cost about 150HKD if I remember correctly. It was okay they misunderstood, I gladly paid for the service since I needed to get to the airport anyhow, but I did not need to reach the airport till about 1430hrs, journey took about an hour and half, so I requested for a late checkout, say 1300hrs instead of the usual 1200hrs, but the hotel just rejected my request flatly. So, I had to lug my luggage to the lobby, sit around for about half an hour, and instead took the 1230hr airport transfer. (I figured getting to the airport earlier beats sitting around at the lobby for more than an hour.) The hotel did not seem packed with arriving tourists before I left, so could not understand why the staff did not allow a late checkout. Oh and WIFI is not free, pay to use, just like about everything else in the room.

Loved the walk to the MTR and back. From exit A2 of the Tin Hau MTR, you're greeted by a milk tea place, noodle and congee shops and convenience stores. And a few MTR stops away, you had Causeway Bay and Mongkok. They gave us a cozy, corner room with a king bed on the 8th floor.

My husband said to book any hotels in causeway bay because of it's location. Hence this was the choice after read the reviews over tripadvisor.com. Not a bad choice if you have no problem for below dislike items. What I dislike most: 1) Bed. I can feel the round springs near the edges of the bed but they topped it up with nice, thick and comfy comforter. But still the bed was soft. I have backache problem as such I needed a harder bed but the bed in this hotel is not able to accommodate my needs. Bed was wide for a king size bed but it's a shorter version. I am 5ft4 and just the length of the bed. Got the idea? I also read about a long steel in the middle of the bed, we suspected it's 2 single bed joined together. 2) Pillow - to both of our opinions, it's the largest I have seen yet the softness I have ever slept on. It thins out when you slept on it. My husband and I have neck problem after one night sleep. What's the hotel solution? They added a harder smaller version pillows to support this. As the result, both of us slept on the smaller harder pillows. 3) Room size - not a good choice for big size Caucasian stay but only smaller and thinner size ones. Their rooms are almost similar size. My husband is 5ft 8 and yes his legs were sort of sticking out. 4) We stayed at room 2608, directly opposite the lifts and we could hear people talking while waiting for the lift early in the morning. Still tolerable. 5) Hongkong coffee, has a sour taste at the end of tastebud. It's heaty to my opinion. What I liked most: 1) Food - a very very convenient place. You can find locals, Viet, Thai and vegetarian food outlet. Yes, vegetarian. I happened to see at least 2 outlet but could be 3. I have the best time of tasting the local food plus buying some fruits. Their wanton mee is not the best. Should go for 'vermicelli wanton' or in Malaysia, we call it mihun wanton or bee hoon wanton. Their vermicelli was smooth and soft. Affordable. Bought apricots in box, sweet. A pharmacy, local electronic shops, so called dry sundry shops and many more. I bought fresh fruit juice near tin hau and along some of the fruit stalls. This stall has some English fruit juice menu which you can order. I can't read chinese but rely on the menu and the owner knows the fruits in English (haha). Try them out. They use original at least 4-5 fruits for a regular paper cup size and cost HKG12 per cup which happened to be the big cup. Very sweet and delicious. There are deserts small store, waffle stores, dim sum restaurant quite a few of them along the roads. 2) If you are into photography, there was a road that has many wet stores, catering seafood, vegetables and etc. 3) Tin Hau station was nearby, approximately 5 mins walk. You need to explore the place first thing you reach and recognise the surrounding outlet. There are about at least 4-5 road (not long ones) but very manageable. Opposite Tin Hau mrt area there is a Watson store. Tin Hau to causeway bay or kowloon, not very far. You must have the octopus card which save some cost and very convenient but if you have coins, you can buy one way journey cost about HKG4 everytime you travel. 4) Convenient to go to Ocean Park without the help of tour agent.

The lobby is small and there are three elevators but the waiting area is very cramped if one is trying to \"queue up\". The rooms are small but were clean. I asked for my room to be changed because I hate staying in rooms with a shared door. The staff was able to do this for me right away. A lot of people comment on the \"magic glass\" in the bathroom and it's fun to play with for 30 seconds but after that it becomes tiring. The hotel has wall mounted LCD TVs but these took a lot of time to \"power up\" and minutes would go by before I could select the TV instead of staring at the navigation menu for the hotel. There is an internet connection but you have to pay for it (HK$120 per day). It should be free. I did not try the breakfast buffet so I cannot comment on it. The price paid for this hotel was very reasonable considering some of the dumps that many unsuspecting travelers end up in. While the hotel *is* across the street from a waste collection site, no smells or noise every bothered me. I like the Tin Hau neighborhood a lot. It is a real neighborhood where people go about their everyday business and is not dotted with touristy shops and big hotels. There is a hotel shuttle bus that goes to the airport but for a fraction of that price you can catch the A11 bus across the street on King's Rd.

You should know the hotel is across the road from the Tin Hau Public Toilet and Refuse Centre - so not a charming street or location in HK (but it is 5 mins walk from MTR train).

Apparently this is a popular hotel for mainland China tour groups - enough said? Buffet breakfast is pretty basic - I wouldn't bother to be honest. Rooms are small and OK in terms of look - but you have to turn on your side to walk from 1 side of the room to the other as only about 30 cms from the end of the bed and the wall! Bathrooms are modern but very tight. Internet, as usual costs a bomb and there's no wireless - bizarre for a modern hotel. It's not where you should stay if on business. I'd prefer to stay in the Metropark Causeway Bay as everything is infinitely better than Empire Hotel - and usually at the same price.

Check-in took a little longer than expected and the staff had the good sense of putting our Louis Vuitton luggage behind the front desk just in case they might walk away.

Be extra cautious when taking a shower as I found the bathroom floor very slippery and the tight space didn't help either. We had to go to Macau the following day and the staff had agreed to lock up some of our luggage till our return and likewise promised to upgrade our room since we would be there for another week. The new room was larger with minimalistic decor and there was a small work area with a swivel chair in front of a window that allowed me a good view of the market on Electric Road and even a glimpse of the Victoria Harbor.

I also have a serious back problem which can affect my mobility and during our stay, I had returned to the hotel on two occasions and the staff responded right away with a wheelchair, brought me up to my room and even offered to put me to bed if needed.

Great service When I had problems with internet access, I had to call Reception several times and they were able to give me the information needed or send the IT person to my room within 10 minutes to attend to my internet access problems. Same for housekeeping requests such as floor mat and iron. That's pretty quick in my opinion. The only reason why I may return to this hotel is their great and prompt service. Bathroom This is the reason why I needed floor mats. The design of the bathroom is faulty. There is no door (glass or otherwise) that separates the shower cubicle from the toilet area, and the bathroom floor is almost level with the floor in the toilet area. Does that raise any alarm in you? What it means is that a lot of water from the shower cubicle will flood the rest of the bathroom, making the floor wet after your shower and gives one a generally icky feeling. I requested for fabric floor mats so that they can absorb the water. There was less of a flood but it didn't entirely eliminate the flooding problem. When I described the flooding problem to the staff, they said they were aware of this but could only attribute it to the bathroom design. The next gripe I have involves the tap/washbasin in the bathroom. The metallic rectangular tap juts out centrally into the washbasin, which makes it difficult for me to bend down to wash my face, because the tap would hit my face. Thought this was a rather awkward design/location for the tap! Location was ok, with 24 hours MacDonalds and several restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but nothing fantastic. The MTR stop Tin Hau is within a few minutes' walk, but I was rather daunted by the last flight of stairs from the underground station to ground level, as I was lugging a rather big piece of luggage and had to carry it up the last flight of stairs (no escalator!)

Everything was clean and modern - my only criticism of the housekeeping service was that it was somewhat unpredictable - you never knew when (or if!) they were likely to arrive - but it all worked out ok.

I'm sure that the Asian options are very good so if you enjoy congee etc for breakfast or are more adventurous than me then I'm sure that this will be to your liking. If not the toast & pastries are fine & get you started for the day. The staff were very polite & helpful, check in & out was hassle free. There were also no musty smells or any other unpleasant odours in the hotel which was a major plus!

The soap dispenser was not refilled - we had watery liquid squirting out of the dispenser instead of gel-like soap which meant they previously filled the dispenser with water instead of soap??

Breakfast options are aplenty (so please don't spend excessively on the forgettable breakfast at the hotel's cafe). Breakfast options include the Cheung Lee Restaurant round the corner. For HKD 20 you get a hot breakfast plus a drink. Or go for the well-known club sandwich. For the local buns and homemade hot soy milk, take two left turns from the hotel. If you're into congee, there are more than 3 options within a 3-min walk. Lunch and dinner options are aplenty too. Roasted meat and rice, fantastic and well-known beef noodle stalls. There's also Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese restaurants. Have a sweet tooth? My pal and I went on a binge almost every night at the many dessert shops near the hotel. For local dessert options, try Ching Ching (green signboard). Cakes and such, try Yu-E (facing the hotel) or The BubbleFactory which has FREE internet access! Bring your laptop. - No clubs but hey, the MTR is a stone's throw away. Imagine walking back tipsy and you need to clear your head? Go to the dessert shop for hot sweet soup and clear your state of mind. Open till midnight. - Location again, people are generally friendlier here as this is considered a suburban area. We felt like we were waking up to a nice gentle pace and headed for the hectic in Wanchai, Central or Causeway only when we were ready. - Taxi ride to Hong Kong Station (for the Airport express) is usually approx. HKD 38. To get to the hotel, take the MTR to Tin Hau, exit from A2 and keep going straight for about 4 - 5 mins (with consideration given to the luggage in tow) past the many local food shops. My pal and I took the tram upon arrival (Yes, with our luggage). Pretty convenient but a bit of a walk from HK station to Central station, about 10 mins. Get to the ground level facing the roads and look for the tram stop facing Citibank. Take the one going East. Took about 30 mins to reach the hotel. More fun and saved some cash - nice experience. - Plenty of laundrettes, and they work fast and clean. - Took a cab to the office in Wanchai. Taxi fare came to a low HKD21, in 8 mins. <Bad> - First room on 22nd flr given smelled bad. I have sinusitis so we were sent to a room on the 26th flr. The latter was a smoking room, literally, as the smoke lingered in the air from the previous group of guests. Finally we were given a non-smoking room on the 30th floor - with a harbour view! That smelt... ok. The weather was at the tail end of winter so there was no way we could accept a room with a dirty filter. - There are 3 lifts. At times, one of the lifts would be under maintenance, but let's cut the hotel some slack. - Facing the local dump, but Surprise Surprise, the local municipality ensured that there was no foul smell emitted from the dump. They even took pains to cover the unsightly entrance with a humoungous and beautifully designed poster. It was no issue at all. - Did not like the shower / toilet area. Both shared the same door, which means if you shower, there's a high chance you wet the floor area of the toilet as well. You end up having to dry the toilet area after each shower. My pal felt it was ok, though. - I like hard beds, but my pal felt that the soft beds were great. - Forget about Internet access at the hotel. Only 2 choices 40HKD for one hour, 120HKD for 24 hours. Go to The BubbleFactory for FREE internet access, bring your laptop. Just be nice to the folks there, and buy something from them. - Housekeeping needs to improve and be consistent.

It is conveniently located just outside the Causeway Bay shopping district and within a few minutes\u2019 walk of the MTR (Tin Hau station). Plus points:- The hotel is almost brand new (as of November \u201909). Therefore everywhere from the lobby area to the actual rooms is in pristine condition. The rooms are extremely modern and are decorated in a very contemporary style. The bathroom had a \u2018magic glass\u2019 button, meaning that you can sit in the bath and un-obscure the glass. This results in you being able to see through the bathroom wall and out of the exterior window. The beds are very comfortable. The rooms are equipped with everything that you need including mini bar, safe, gowns etc. The air conditioning worked very well as did the shower. Being less than 5minutes walk away from Tin Hau station means that it is feasible to get from the airport to the hotel, without having to take a taxi It is possible to walk back from a night out in Causeway Bay, after the MTR has closed, in around 15 \u2013 20 minutes. Although I didn\u2019t try the restaurant, the choice of food (and prices) found in the room service menu, looked quite reasonable. The hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant. The price (again, as of November \u201909) appeared very reasonable in comparison to other similar hotels. Negative points (generally very minor):- The hotel lacked a bar, gym and pool \u2013 facilities that some of the similar priced hotels, had.(Not a major issue, as personally when I am staying in Hong Kong I prefer to be out rather than in.) The views from the rooms (certainly at least up to the 13th floor), were obscured by tall residential tower blocks. Unfortunately during my stay, one of the three lifts was out of service, meaning that it took a while to get down to the lobby in the mornings.

There was however, a long wait for the lift up to our room on Level 13. This was something that happened each time we needed to go up/down. Upon reaching our floor, I noticed a strong cigarette smell in the hallway and also in our room (I had asked for a non-smoking room). The smell left once we had turned the air con on, however the smokey smell would always be there when we returned to our room in the afternoon. I think our neighbours must have been smoking and the smoke travels through the vents .. I am not sure. But once the air con was on the smell disappeared. The room was small but that was expected. Everything else was sufficient and the magic glass in the bathroom wouldn't be a problem if you wanted some privacy. My only concern is that the carpet seemed a little dirty and could do with a vacuum. I don't think they vacuumed the floor once during our stay. We did not eat at the hotel as on the neighbouring \"electric road\" there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. The Tak Cheong noodle shop, Mak's beef noodles and the ching ching dessert shops are a must try. I also cannot really comment on the customer service from the staff as we did not have much dealings with them. We really only used the hotel to shower + sleep at night. Another thing I noticed was the huge number of tourists/tour groups from the mainland staying at The Empire. I would recommend this hotel to other travellors due to it being such great value.

Upon asking I discovered there was no milk! (Lucky I don't take milk in my coffee) Design: Lifts: * When the lift arrives you can't tell if it's going up or down, there's just a single light. After going the wrong way a couple of times you soon learn to ask the occupants \"going up or down?\" (is this the 1950s?) * Only the G floor has indicators to show where the lifts currently are while you wait. On guest and restaurant levels you just wait and wait with no idea when the lift will arrive. To amuse yourself you can watch the \"out of service\" sign scroll over and over. * Inside the lift it's too dark to read the buttons * The important G and 1 (Restaurant) buttons are not separated from guest floor buttons. I saw a number of people get out at the Restaurant when they meant to get out at the Lobby (G). * There's a nice LCD TV to watch the news in the lift - it's mounted high but the picture is distorted unless you stand at the very back of the lift (a bit like the way the picture distorts on an aircraft back of seat TV until you adjust the brightness) Room: * Door closes heavily with a loud bang - it needs some damping. If you're unlucky your neighbours bang the doors all night. * The bathroom is in a glassed off corner of the room with \"magic glass\" to make it opaque. The problem is if you have a hot shower you get condensation in the whole room: everything is damp for ages afterwards. It could affect electronic devices. * The towel rail is inconveniently placed to give you maximum opportunity to bump your head on the corner of it. The hotel is new (3 mths old) and has potential. The rooms are nicely finished but so many design flaws and service issues make staying here a frustrating experience. I think it promises much more than it delivers - a bit more attention to service and expectation setting and it would be good. I hate to whinge like this on a 3rd party web site but I did try and contact them via their website with my feedback.

First of all, its NOT in Causeway Bay but in the next area called Tin Hau. They probably called it Causeway Way because that's a far more popular and marketable location. However, this hotel is not badly located at all. Its just 5 mins walk to the Tin Hau MTR station (which is one stop from Causeway Bay). The biggest bonus about the location is that its located right in the middle of the eating street of Tin Hau with all sorts of local, Asian and foreign restaurants. The hotel room itself is quite a standard Hong Kong hotel room albeit with some nice modernist touches with the usual glass and metal finishes which can be quite cool. The rooms are however on the small side and the writing desk is absolutely tiny (it can barely fit a book and a notebook computer). The other downside to the hotel is that it only has local TV channels and not a single foreign pay TV channel. I hope this is because its new and they haven't added the new Pay TV channels. All in all, this is a very comfortable (albeit on the small side) hotel in a very convenient location and represents very good value. I would thoroughly recommend it for a comfortable stay in HK. Watch out for the \"Magic Button\" situated in both the bathroom and the side of the bed. Its so cool and absolutely hilarious!!", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Empire Hotel Causeway Bay", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1236984-Reviews-The_Empire_Hotel_Causeway_Bay-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$115 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.8 Wing Hing Street, Causeway Bay</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1236984", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1e/2d/1e2dd8e63f53170c9b4209c090edd60c3large.jpg"}}
