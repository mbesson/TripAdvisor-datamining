The rooms were cozy (read \"small\"-but that is typical in the historic district), but had plenty of storage and I had a great view from my balcony-style windows.

And then there are the rooms which are lovely...I know some may think they are small but I didn't think so...I've been in much smaller in many other cities (Athens, London, etc). I loved the old wood floors, the regal crown molding, the rooms were inviting and comfortable. (they also have a heated swimming pool though we didn't use it --too busy running around). The location was outstanding...a block or so from the tram, many wonderful sidewalk cafes/restaurants to chose from nearby, & walking distance to the Spice Market. All that would have prompted me to give the Hotel my highest rating but I also had some trouble with an airline reservation and Ali and the manager, Engin, worked tirelessly to sort it out.

The tram is just down the street and only 1 Turkish Lira per person per trip without buying a pass. This is a great way to head over to the Asian side and also to zip around the city - consult your travel guides for the simple 1 or 2 lines that run. Hotel is reachable by foot only - our shuttle bus parked around the corner and helped us with our bags to the hotel. The hotel arranged a FREE shuttle FROM the airport only - we had to pay about 20 Euro to take a 5am van back to the airport. There is a top rated restaurant, Pasazade just kiddy corner across the street from the hotel - excellent and a higly recommended Trip Advisor restaurant. We loved it and wished we had found it at the beginning of our trip rather than the end. Our room was the basic, standard room and tightly held 3 twin beds and a cramped but suffient bathroom with a little tile work problem (perhaps an earthquake shook some tiles loose?) and we heard the plumbing from our neighbors above and to the side every time they flushed, ran the shower, or sink; we could also hear our neighbors scooting around and things from the street - but it wasn't really all that distruptive; a sensitive sleeper may benefit from earplugs. It wasn't anything I wouldn't expect from a refurbished building of this era.

Think gold cornices, inlaid timbers doors and dresser. Completely different to the run of the mill chain hotels. We loved it. The room was quite small, which is fine for two, but if you are planning for a party it will be too small. There is an incredible array available on the breakfast buffet, both Western and Turkish, hot and cold. It was a high point of each day. Sapphire is in a quaint lane way in the heart of the tourist area. We walked to all of the tourist areas and were very comfortable strolling around to select a restaurant for dinner each evening, though one of our favourites was straight across the lane. We made good use of the free wifi and really appreciated the free pickup from the airport. My wife is very sensitive to cigarette smoke, but there was no problem here.

First the location is perfect for a tourist in that it is 5 or so mins walk from Topkapi Palace, Aya Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Basilica Cistern, the Galata Bridge, 10 to the Spice Bazaar and the Grand Bazaar and around 15 mins to the Suleymaniye Mosque. Also, it is very close to a tram stop, which is cheap to use (2 Lira flate rate per trip) and that line will take you to within 5 mins walk of the Dolhambace Palace and the Theodosian Walls (at Topkapi - not to be confused with the Palace). The hotel is on a narrow bustling street lined with cafes, restaurants and other hotels which means there is buzz, but also your room may be overlooking it. It is traffic free but there is music (not loud, not late and definitely not disco type music) and the noise of busy bustle so you may want ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Second, the staff are outstandingly pleasant, efficient, helpful and impartial. For example, I heard someone asking if they could change money at the hotel. The staff said that, of course they could, but they charge 3% commission and the person could get a better rate at a place around the corner. When I arrived, the 2 wall lights in my room were not working and I mentioned it at reception. Someone came back with me in the lift to sort the problem (one bulb gone and one fitting loose that needed jiggling) immediately. All advice on directions, things to do etc etc was very helpful and cheerfully given. Even before I arrived e-mails were responded to inside a day. These 2 things alone warrant a recommendation, and I would (probably will) go back. I had a single room which was fine for me. I don't know if other rooms are bigger but this would have been cramped for 2. The big bed (2 full sized singles pushed together) had plenty of room one side but was only a few inches from the wall and window the other side, (I do wish, however, that they would always use sheets that are big so that the bottom one tucks in on the sides and at the bottom. They were changed frequently, however) Flat screen satellite TV (instructions as to how to work it would have helped: I never worked it out, but didn't care). Bathroom was fine if you like showers (good power shower and hot water) - the bath was small to bathe it and the sealant against the wall was a bit scruffy. Mini-bar and fridge and safe box in the room. My room was hot and the air conditioning only seemed to blow hot, but it was early November so opening a window during the day was fine. Very clean. (See above for comments about overlooking the small street outside). Free wi-fi is provided and this worked well. Overall, for me, the room was fine but not brilliant. Breakfast was a large buffet and was also fine. The lobby/lounge area is comfortable and a nice area to read/chat or use a computer. There is a bar just off it, so you can have a drink but it's not buzzy, just a place to get a drink from. Lots of buzzy places right outside the door though. I think the hotel has a restaurant but I didn't use it and did not see anyone else doing so. The front desk recommended a restaurant 50m away (Ozler) which was so good that I happily ate there most evenings. (I'd definitely recommend it). Another example of good advice from the front desk. There are dozens of restauants within 3 mins walk. The hotel has a pool and sauna in the basement but I didn't go down there so can't comment. The hotel organises a free pick up from the airport, which worked fine. They arranged a private transfer back to the airport (50 lira/20 Euro) which developed mechanical problems en route and did most of the journey in 2nd gear but that's hardly the hotel's fault!

There are lots of shops and restaurants within a 5 min walk, the tram is a <5 min walk away, and several of the historic sites are within a 5-15 min walk from the hotel. The lobby was clean and spacious as well as the rooms. There was a fridge/mini bar, large bathroom, cable tv (with about 8 English speaking channels), and central heating. I checked in very early (8am) so I didn't expect them to have a room ready but they were able to hold my bags. Everyone at check in was helpful and friendly. They offered a free shuttle back to the airport but when I went to ask about it upon checkout, they didn't have a record of it. I attribute that to a mix up perhaps of what room I was in (at 8am they told me I was in 105, but when I came back later they changed that to 102). This wasn't a big deal as I preferred to take the tram back to the airport anyway which was easy enough to do.

MUCH better customer service, an equally comfortable room, wi-fi that actually worked, and a way better location. And I think my air conditioning was the first I'd found in six Turkey hotels (all much more expensive than this one) that actually worked! When I walked into the hotel I never even made it to the desk. A staff member came out, invited me to sit down on a couch, had apple tea and a piece of lokoum delivered to the coffee table in front of me, and then brought out a little stool to sit on and lots of information about the area (not realizing I had already been here a few days, just stayed elsewhere). He answered questions, advised me on a tasty restaurant across the street, and was generally attentive, friendly, and informative. The staff seems overall very young--college-age, maybe--but this did not mean they didn't know what they were doing. The breakfast buffet was comparable in size to the one I'd had at the much more expensive hotel, with more variety. I did discover, staying two nights and eating two breakfasts, that freshness was not up to my standards; some rolls were hardened, some salad items looked their age, and the cheese was obviously making its second appearance at the buffet--you can always tell with cheese, it gets translucent and hard around the edges. The yogurt also looked SO lumpy that I decided against trying it. But what was fresh, was good. Other travelers have remarked how much they enjoyed the parrot in the first-floor sitting area. He is a delightful fellow, but obviously unhappy as he is pulling out all his feathers. Anyone who knows birds at all can't help but feel sad upon seeing him. This guy needs a home with attentive family members, or a staff member who can give him the attention he needs over the course of years; obviously the intermittent attention of travelers as they get on and off the elevator is not enough for his needs. One more thing: it is just plain chintzy to provide unlabeled bottles of shampoo that have been used and refilled multiple times (there was crusted shampoo on the outsides of them). Either provide fresh, new toiletries or don't provide them at all. There is a discount market around the corner from the hotel where someone who REALLY needs toiletries can buy them for next to nothing. I know it sounds like I had a lot of problems with this hotel. Really, I pick on it because it is otherwise so great, and a few little improvements would make it the best value in town.

On arrival I found myself in a twin bedded room but as I had expected a double bed I asked if I could change rooms and this was done quickly and efficiently. The air conditioned room included a well stocked mini-bar and room safe and tea/coffee-making facilities. Windows looked out onto a courtyard and could be opened.

I did request a plug but it never arrived, so if I return to Istanbul I must remember to bring one with me! Breakfast is served in the basement area where an extremely wide range of buffet items was available. I confess that many of these foods were unfamiliar to me but there were also more standard items such as scrambled egg and ham to suit my basic English taste! My only irritation was that only flavoured teas (no English Breakfast tea) were available - it seems that it is more common in Turkey to drink flavoured tea. A floor down from the basement led to a swimming pool and sauna.

The location was almost ideal. The hotel is a two minute walk to the tram line, as well as five minutes from Topkapi, Aya Sofia, and the Blue Mosque. The tram line is very important, as there's not a lot of quality restaurants or bars in the immediate area, but a $1 tram ride away is Beyoglu with a huge selection.

We arrived late on a Thursday evening, and a member of the staff personally escorted us to the ATM and pointed out his favorite baklava store. He then walked us to a restaurant around the corner and spoke to the host and waiter to make sure we would be taken care of. We were amazed and felt so excited about our trip from this auspicious beginning! Staff was helpful in all our requests, and the hotel is perfectly located in the Old City within walking distance to all the historical sights.

When we got to our room I was pleasantly surprised to find it quite spacious (at least by the standard of hotel rooms in the old city) and light and airy. This was a pleasant surprise and I found the hallways quite dark and dingy. (Only need a bit of a facefilt - new, lighter carpet perhaps?) They provide a hotel safe which was the only one we found in our travels that worked really well. There were tea and coffee facilities, bathrobes, and nice adequate towlls. But the clincher was the lovely bedding - very comfortable mattresses and lovely white doonas. When we left, again early in the morning, they gave us sandqiches, plus two lovely gifts to take with us - a set with apple tea and tea glasses, and some turkish delight. Very nice thought. The hotel was in a superb position with many restaurants virtually on the doorstep, and good shopping nearby. We found the hotel staff exceptionally helpful with good english, and the room rate was very reasonable, at 80 euros per night. The only negative I can say about the place is that on our first night there the people in the next room must have been watching a very funny video, because there was a sudden burst of laughter quite late in the night, which continued for about 10 minutes or so. Then all was quiet. Then the only noise we heard from adjoining rooms was minimal. In an expensive hotel that may be unacceptable, but for this rate, how can one complain. Incidentally, I have stayed at 5 star hotels where there is a lot more noise coming through the walls, so apart from that first night, it is not really a complaint. Just a bit of a shock.

The location of the hotel was very good and just a short (5 min) stroll to the main historic sites. The staff were very friendly and gave some helpful advice on the main sites opening/closing times and recommended a good hammam that allowed couples to go in together (I think just next to Suleymaniye mosque). As with other reviewers, we were subject to a bit of a sell to get us to join some organised trips when we checked in - this will suit some, but we found it a bit tiresome. Breakfast was OK, but focused on quantity more than quality. The room was nice and well appointed, but there were a number of 'gremlins' that I think would have annoyed others more fussy than us - for example there was no hot water one evening (it seemed to have run out), towels weren't always changed and the air conditioning made a strange beeping noise (when off). These problems were mentioned to the service desk and to varying degrees sorted out. The bed was, however, v.comfortable and we slept very well. Overall, I would stay here again as it was OK and a better price than others in the location, but might be tempted to explore other options if they were more competitive on price. A few tips: (i) Worth getting to the palace early as gets very busy from mid-morning and so you get stuck repeatedly queueing to see the more popular bits. (ii) No probs catching taxis, but many seemed to have trouble finding the hotel (possibly in truth, possibly just going for a bigger fare). Best to ensure they are clear they know where they are going before you set off. (iii) Some OK restaurants (Olive and Pasazade) and bars near to the hotel, but v.touristy. Definitely worth making the effort to go over to the Beyoglu district, as this is where the Turkish are and the atmosphere and choices much better.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Chrischris50", "ReviewID": "UR109035222", "Content": "Me and my girlfriend stayed there for 4 nights at early may!

Also, the call to prayers, some as early as 0700, can detract from your experience due to the excellent location. All important sights are within easy walking distance, except the Grand Bazaar, which is about a mile away. The reception we received was wonderful! EVERYONE behind the front desk is trained to sit down with guests upon checkin to give a 5 minute briefing, complete with maps. All employees were very friendly, even though some maids did not speak English. A call to the front desk about operation of the TV brought a young man to the room in about 3 minutes. Problem solved! LOTS of inexpensive sidewalk fast food places are nearby; as is a convenience store where you can purchase anything from bottled water to juice to fruit & snacks at reasonable prices. The hotel serves a fantastic buffet breakfast, included in the price. On the 30' long table are typical Mediterranean breakfast fare, along with scrambled eggs, meat, juices, bread & rolls of every type, as well as some excellent cheeses. If you go away hungry - you have a big problem!!! They do not serve lunch or dinner, so you are not a captive audience. Rather, right outside, you will find about 10 restaurants in the IMMEDIATE vicinity. We do not vouch for any of them since we ate mostly sidewalk food & fruit during our 5 day stay. We booked our 5 days with a popular website for 60 euro per night. Prior to the Sapphire, we spent 12 days on an Affordable Turkey tour with a budget agency - FANTASTIC!

The reception parrot chats when you pass him by, the cosy luxury reception area is ideal to sit in and take coffee, write postcards, read your book. Deniz on the recpetion was so helpful, telling us the best way to get anywhere, approx cost of cabs, tram stops etc. He even phoned a shop where we wanted to buy a tv to warn them of our arrival. All in all this hotel is so good i am already planning the return visit. Just as we felt it could not get better, when we checked out we were given a small christmas /new years present. One of the best alternative christmas breaks i have had.

The amount of concern he expressed and the attention he paid to our issue (even more concerned than we were!) was truly amazing and very much appreciated.

Our booking was a little complicated as Istanbul was our base as we travelled around. So it was 3 stays at Hotel sapphire, requiring 3 separate bookings. I was quite concerned if there would be a mix up, as the hotel only had 4 triple rooms and July is quite a busy month for them. At first glance, the hotel seemed small and unassuming. The decor, quaintly old world. The rooms were clean but quite small. With three beds and several suitcases, ours was filled to capacity. The hotel is located on a small cobblestoned street, overlooking another hotel and several restaurants. But at the far end of the street, you could see a mosque with towering minarets to remind you that you were in Istanbul. The proximity to the major sights (just a 15 minute walk) , to a number of restaurants and souvenir shops was perfect for us. The breakfast provided by the hotel was large and sumptuous. After a day's sightseeing, the children could swim while I browsed around the shops in the vicinty. The children thoroughly enjoyed the parrot in the reception and the swimming pool. It was a 2 minute walk to the nearest tram stop and we used the tram to the get to the Grand Bazaar, which was 3 stops away. Just about everything was easily accessible. The staff need a special mention, especially Mr. Engin. They were highly efficient and friendly. Every request was taken care of with a smile. Absolutely no request was declined and you were always made to feel welcome. All three of our stays went by smoothly. A few hours after leaving Turkey we realised I had left behind my jewellery case in the room. It contained some jewellery I was very sentimental about and the pendrive with all our pictures from the month spent in Europe. Needless to say, I was miserable. We requested the hotel to help us but the chances of recovering lost jewellery seemed very slim to me. When they reverted that they had found nothing in the room, it wasn't a surprise. However, a week later, I received an email from the hotel that they had found the jewellery case. They had obviously continued to look for it. I received it with every single piece of jewellery intact and the pendrive with all our pictures. Next time I go to istanbul, I am definitely staying there again.

Upon arriving, after our free pick-up from the airport, we received a welcoming drink & a piece of Turkish delight as the staff checked us in & provided us with a map of the city to get us oriented. They could not have been friendlier or more welcoming! We were taken to our room, which had two twin beds instead of one queen (which I had requested via email), but I asked if it were possible to get another room & we were immediately moved without hesitation. The room was clean & nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable, but don't be surprised with the sparse bedding! (This seemed to be the case everywhere we stayed in Turkey, though. I don't think they place emphasis on \"luxurious\" bedding like we do in the U.S.) The bathroom was great & the shower always had hot water. (The hair dryer was interesting, though. It got so hot that I couldn't finish drying my hair without using a towel to hold it because it was burning my hand!) I also loved how you could open the windows - we slept with them open at night, & it was fairly quiet facing the back of the hotel. The daily call to prayer at about 4:45am was an early wake-up call, but you can always fall back asleep or bring earplugs! And if you have not yet read about the breakfast...wow. We have never seen such a breakfast buffet in our lives! Granted, I still have no idea what some of the items were, but everything we tried was excellent. A great start to each day! And whenever you want Turkish tea throughout the day or after a long day out on the town, just ask. It is complimentary! The location of the hotel was also perfect - you could literally walk everywhere. There is a city rail system that we used once to get to Taksim Square - it is easy to use, but it can get really crowded & it does not seem to have much a/c so we only used it once & preferred to walk everywhere else! The only annoyance about the location is that it is surrounded by restaurants & they are relentless in wanting you to stop in or just take a quick look at the menu. Be polite but firm in your \"no thank you\" or else you will spend all of your time looking at menus instead of sightseeing! Overall, the price we paid for this hotel compared to the services we received was unbelievable. We thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our stay here, & we cannot wait to return!

Situated in the heart of Sultanahmet and within walking distance of the major sites, the hotel is on a pedestrian-only street which means that you are immune from the dangers and noise of traffic. The hotel's facilities are good and decoration is in the slightly over-blown, Eastern European style. Our room was clean and comfortable with efficient air-conditioning. Unfortunately, the roof terrace was being renovated during our stay. The breakfasts were very good with a large choice of cereals, breads and hot and cold food. Tea lovers might like to get their cuppas before it has stood too long in the urn as the longer it stood the stronger it became! The real strength of The Sapphire lies in its staff. From their initial bright and cheery welcome they could not have been more helpful or accommodating. Their bright and cheerful demeanor was always in evidence and we felt very well looked after at all times. The hotel is surrounded by restaurants. They are of variable quality but the one immediately opposite the entrance toThe Sapphire was our favourite. However, Istanbul is awash with restaurants and there is a particularly good selection in the streets behind the Blue Mosque. Our top tips would be: 1. Use Backpackers for transfers and tours - very reliable and reasonably priced. 2. Don't buy Bosphorous tours from anyone - use the ferries and create your own. It's much cheaper and more fun. 3. Make use of the excellent tram system - 1.5 lira flat rate for any journey and regular and efficient. 4. If there is no tram route where you want to go, take a taxi, they are also cheap. 5. Don't drink at the North Shield pub around the corner from the hotel - their prices are ruinous. 6. Don't put your fingers too far into the cage of the hotel parrot - its beak is strong and sharp!

Most of the staff there were not friendly at all save for one, but even he forgot to return my credit card after I had signed the slip when we were checking out on our last day.

While my wife was waiting at the lobby for a good 2 hours for the airport shuttle to pick her up, the hotel front desk staff showered her with a lot of care and attention. Despite my wife's polite decline, they still insisted on bringing her some hot Turkish apple tea, which happened to be her favorite drink throughout our trip in Turkey. What a great team of wonderful staff who understand the true meaning of hospitality! We wouldn't stay anywhere else but the Safir (Sapphire) Hotel when we should ever return to Istanbul again. We say this from the bottom of our hearts! Any downside? Sure... Just two irritating things that we can think of. Firstly, the street in front of the hotel is out of bounds to any vehicular traffic. Hence, if one has many heavy suitcases, it is a hassle to drag or lug them from/to the neighbouring streets about half a block away where the airport shuttle or taxi is waiting or dropping off. Plus, it isn't easy to wheel the suitcases since the street is cobble-stoned and not flat. Secondly, the street in front of the hotel can get pretty noisy due to the late night revellers dining and drinking at the many Turkish & Ottoman restaurants and bars surrounding the Safir. That's why the extra pillows we ordered came in most handy as reliable \"ear plugs\" to send us to dreamland quite effortlessly!", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "essex", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel location-- very good service\u201d", "Author": "licksmith", "ReviewID": "UR65926869", "Content": "stayed 5 nights - booked based on this forums reviews-- great choice--did have to change rooms 1st night but only because we were given single beds-- no trouble with staff,no reminders needed, came back following day and our cases had been transfered -- breakfast far better than average--good choice for most tastes--fresh orange served at our table every morning--spotless display--staff very helpful-welcome drink on arrival-- free wifi with two computors on hand-- even lent me a small laptop one evening when both were being used--great way to check out the local resturants before you left the hotel on an evening--tried my best to teach the house parrott a feel expletives but he wasn't having any of it, he just kept wistleling the staff for attention with varing hellos--even gave each room a leaving thank you gift--can't say what it was because it'll spoil your surprise if you book here-- just that it was a nice jesture and a useful gift-- good location from all the sites-tram just arround the corner-- just one small black mark-one of the staff and i say one only because all the others were great fun and couldn't do enough for you ,had a very irretating habit ,that being when he recommended the hotel transport or a paticular resturant would offer to make a booking on a scrap of paper and if you than delined he made a big fuss and tore up the reservation into confetti \"so you want to cancel this booking\" totally unnessary as it was on a scrap of paper not been accepted anyway--he did it to us once and i saw him do it three other times --shame really but i would definetly recommend this hotel - great valve for money---great location and fabulous staff, well except for one irretating clown", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY, NY", "Title": "\u201cTerrific hotel -- location, staff, comfort, and cost can't be beat\u201d", "Author": "skwood", "ReviewID": "UR65803643", "Content": "I booked this hotel based on the excellent TripAdvisor ratings and I'm now joining the chorus of enthusiasm.

Walking in the opposite direction, and also in 10 minutes, you'll find yourself in front of the impressive Yeni Camii (New Mosque) and Eminonu ferry port. The rooms are smaller than what you are used to, but any quick search will tell you that hotel rooms in Sultanahmet are generally on the smaller side to begin with. As small as they may be, you can't help but be impressed at the ornate, traditional Ottoman designs that adorn the ceilings and walls. Very cozy. To top things off, you'll be greeted at the airport with a driver to pick you up and take you to the hotel! This was a great help. They don't drive you back to the airport, but they do offer a van for 40 liras (no matter how many people are in your group). After you make your hotel reservation, the friendly manager (Engin) will send you an e-mail collecting your flight information so that a driver can be waiting for you. I'm telling you, the staff takes good care of you here! More on the helpful staff. One of my friend's power adapter/converter fused out, so the staff lent us two. They gave plenty of suggestions on where to go (even though we'd done our research). We went during Bayram (Eid al Adha) - a huge Muslim holiday (3-4 days long in Turkey); the staff gave us great tips on what to see and what crowd control would be like during our stay. They also offered to mail all of my postcards so that I could save a trip to the local post office. Another big plus was their free wifi and free breakfast!!! I booked directly from this website (I believe I ended up making the final purchase from booking.com), and I recommend you do the same!", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNot a 4 Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "suzbond", "ReviewID": "UR50370793", "Content": "This hotel is adequate but was below my expectations from what I read in the reviews.

Also if you get an airport pick up it costs 20 Euro but when you want a transfer to the airport it's 40 TLira. Not a huge difference but it's annoying when you know they're playing with exchange rates to get an extra bit out of you if it was one of the other I would have been happy to pay but just to get an extra 4 Lira... come on guys! Also we were told that getting a taxi to the airport would be 50+ TL but later found out it was about 30 TL so we shouldn't have booked through the hotel. The room we got was tiny and we stayed in a comparable hotel very close to this one and the room was way bigger and much brighter and it was the same price. Other than that, the staff were effecient. The place was clean and when we left they were very friendly but believe it was linked to ensuring we gave a good review.

We had three single rooms. It is in an extremely good position - near to a tram stop at Gulhane and within easy walking distance of both the Old City and the Galata Bridge. The staff are very friendly and helpful, especially Ali and Deniz who were at the reception desk to welcome us when we arrived. I lost my e-ticket for the return flight and they immediately offered to let me use the manager's computer and print a new one off. (There is a computer in the lobby for the use of guests but it has no printer.) One of my friends left her glasses in the taxi to the Chora Church (which the hotel had ordered, at our request) and when Reception was contacted, they immediately phoned the taxi company and the glasses were delivered to the hotel very quickly. All very efficient - we were not made to feel we were being a nuisance. The rooms are fine - not the Ritz but comforatable, clean and with double glazing, air conditioning and tea and coffee making facilities. Mine - at the front on the second floor - was rather noisy on the first night (jollity from nearby restaurants as it was a warm evening and people were eating and drinking outside, then I think the bins being collected). The next morning I asked for a room higher up and at the back of the hotel and was allocated one with no fuss. Just two small niggles - the pillows were very hard and there was no plug for the bath. To be fair, I didn't mention the pillows (made do with a cushion, which was fine) and they produced a plug when I asked. The breakfast is really good - lots of choice and all nice and fresh. One tip - the Turquoise restaurant right outside the hotel is really good - we only discovered it on our last two nights! Good food (a cut above the usual kebabs) and friendly service and once they get to know you you can get a good deal on a bottle of wine. A warning - one of my friends was the subject of a scam at the ATMs in Sultanahmet, between Aya Sofia and the Blue Mosque (just round the corner from the underground sistern). A Turkish guy told her the ATM she was about to use was broken and she could use the one he'd just been at. He'd obviously doctored it as her card would not go in properly. He pretended to help her and said the only way she could either get money out or her card back was to put in her pin number. Despite covering the pad with her guide book, he obviously read the pin number and then miraculously the card was 'eaten up' and he disappeared into the crowds. Of course, he had taken the card. She rang her bank very quickly on the lost cards number but he had already taken out money and ordered several things off the internet in the first ten minutes. The staff at the Sapphire were very sympathetic but had obviously heard the tale before. Better to get money from the ATMs that are in banks or outside banks and not in crowded areas, preferably with someone you know behind you and looking out for trouble. Apart from this, our week in Istanbul was amazing and the Sapphire was perfect.

It is also 2 minutes walk from the Light Rail System. This is great if you want to visit the other side of Istanbul. We took it after our second day to see the Beyoglu and Besiktas areas in which fewer tourists go (but the food is way better). The Grand Bazaar and Sulimanye Mosques are also relatively close, about 15 minutes (but Sulimanye is under major construction). 4) They picked us up from the airport which was very nice. Though we had to pay for the trip to the airport for departure, which was 45 Turkish Lira, which is about 30 dollars, I still consider this a deal since they picked us up for free! 5) They were always attentive, when I asked some questions in English and they could not understand, they would get someone to answer my questions. 6) Several times we asked for extra bars of soap/towels/shampoo, and we were quickly taken care of. 7) Breakfast is included and consists of breads, meats, juice, fruits, and cereal. 8) The rooms are a little bit smaller, but we were warned of this, its equivalent to a larger room in NYC hotels (which are smaller and cost a LOT more). AC worked fine and there are safes provided in the room, along with a minibar. My girlfriend who accompanied me, loved this hotel - mostly because of the service they provide.

However, the area where the hotel is located is very, very touristy (in fact, the street where the hotel is is crowded with restaurants and shops for tourists only). One really positive thing about the hotel is that they organize a free transfer (one way only) from the airport to the hotel. Therefore, you need to forget about wandering around the city and trying to find the hotel, or feeling that you are ripped off by some weird taxi driver. The main hall of the hotel is a bit disappointing and dull, and the rooms are quite small. Take into account that there are two types of rooms: (a) superior rooms; and (b) normal rooms. Take the superior rooms, as they have free coffee making facilities. Breakfast is very Turkish, with olives (!) and plenty of Turkish delicacies. However, breakfast is served in the basement, and this is a bit disappointing. The service at the reception desk is just ok. We felt as we were not really welcome at the hotel, and, for example, when we asked whether we could get suggestions for a \"non-tourist\" restaurant, we were looked at as we were crazy. In general, the reception workers seemed not to want to spend a whole lot of time with us and answering our questions. One really bad thing is that you have to pay for the maps of the city, and only the very small map the hotel provides you with (with some blocks of the area where the hotel is located) is free. Finally, and something which absolutely suprised us, was that the reception workers tried to \"bribe\" us giving us, at check-out, some boxes Turkish delights (is a kind of Turkish sweets) to take home and requesting to write a good review of the hotel (both at Tripadvisor and at w------------m, where we made the reservation).

A safe for valuables, a mini bar and a kettle with teabags !!! What more could you ask for and at such great prices. Especially when you are handed a gift at the end of your stay. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel and would NEVER go anywhere else if I ever return to Istanbul.

We did turn the first room down as the window faced a building wall, again not a problem to the staff. Another cup of tea and before we knew it a room was ready. The hotel goes to great length to state that their rooms are not as big as other hotels - why? I don't know as the room was perfectly fine. Lovely Bathroom/Shower with toiletries.

Yes I know not very green but we did save carbon miles by going via train Buffet breakfast very good but don't get caught out by the ten am finish - we and others did. Tips - Its a lovely area around the hotel, good restaurants, cafes, quiet back streets and the esential laundry. Turn right out of the hotel, first right again and go 50 yards on your right for the best laundry service you will ever get. Located well for the main attractions, we used the tram occasionally (excellent service) but walked mainly so that we could absorb this beautiful city. Also took the Bosphorus trip (FAB) and the ferry to the Asian side Uskadar - don't miss that one. Change your money when you get there. Its true they give a MUCH better rate than at home Avoid main sights in the morning unless you want to run the gauntlet with tour parties - and there are lots!!!!!!!!!!!!! Visit mosques later in the day when you will be able to appreciate the true splendour and peacefulness And finally we learnt some essential Turkish before arriving. Is it necessary, perhaps not but when you do make the effort the lovely Turkish people engage with you on a completely different level and we ended up teaching each other our respective languages.

The hotel is located on a pedestrian-only street, hence quiet in the evenings. Although currently (March 2009) there is some on-going construction work at a nearby building and we had one noisy night during our stay. There is a small supermarket (BIM) nearby so it is easy to get bottled water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the water in Istanbul smells strong Chlorine, hence not drinkable. There are a wide variety of choices for the breakfast there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Turkish ones are nice, but the cereals taste a bit stale, and the fruits do not look fresh. We were allocated a Superior Room which is clean and nicely furnished. The bathroom is a decent size, but there is a tile missing above the bath, showing the pipes behind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my guess is that an extractor fan used to be there. We used the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free airport pickup service on arrival and paid 40TRL for hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxis service to the airport. On checking out, the staff gave us a box of Turkish delight and a box of Apple Tea with cups and saucers as presents, which is nice. A very nice restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Pasazade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is just opposite Hotel Sapphire. We walked in the restaurant on the night of arrival by chance, but ate there during our entire stay in Istanbul \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 6 suppers plus 1 lunch. The restaurant specialises in Ottoman Cuisine which is delicious and the price is very reasonable: 6-17 TRL for main and 5 TRL for starter or dessert. The menu has a picture for each dish, and Staff are very friendly and attentative.

Like many others, we thought that the hotel was too good to be true, but at less than \u00c2\u00a390 for three nights we booked it anyway. I am glad to say that the hotel is worthy of the reviews that we read. On arrival at the hotel (after a nightmare taxi drive), we were given an orange juice cocktail and some turkish delight by the hotel. We were shown to our room which was a twin room - not a double as we had booked. We called reception and asked for a double room and they politely sent the bell boy up. However, once we were shown our double room (Room 305), we were dissapointed as it was nowhere near as nice as the twin room. It obviously was one of the non-refurbished ones as reviews had previously stated, and the bathroom was worn and the shower door was broken. Therefore we called for a second time, and despite our fussiness they took us back to the original twin room (Room 113). The room was on the small side, but very clean and had an LCD tv which impressed my OH... The bathroom was nice and modern with a very powerful shower. As we were in Istanbul in late January, the hotel was very quiet with only a few tables at breakfast. The breakfast was ok. There was a wide variety of things, but all were very turkish - cheeses, meats, olives, hummous etc. The pool and sauna area surprised us as they were really nice. We used them on two occasions and both times we were the only ones down there. The location of the hotel is perfect - all of the main sites are within a 5/10 minute walk and the tram station is just round the corner. There are quite a few bars and restaurants on the road of the hotel, which we mainly decided to avoid as they hassled us quite a lot. I would recommend walking to the Galata bridge at Eminou and trying one of the fish sandwiches at Aruna cafe - they were delicious! When we checked out at the end of our stay we were asked where we heard about the hotel, to which we told them trip advisor. They then asked us to write a good review on here giving us apple tea and a box of turkish delight.

If you cannot walk very well then the local tramstop is just around the corner. The hotel is very clean and althought they said the room would be small as it was in the old town we did not find it that way at all. Plenty of room for the two of us, bathroom fine aswell. Breakfast had a vast array of items you could choose from so there is something for everyone. All the staff were more than helpfull and i would certainly return. There is a pool in the basement together with a sauna, both free of charge. We used this facility one afternoon and it was a good way to relax your leg muscles, Our room was 69 euros a night which we thought was good value. You could also get an set course evening meal for only 10 euro per person at the hotel which was fine. All in all, this is a great hotel to use as a base in Istanbul which is amazing.

However it could have been much worse; no thanks to EasyJet and their hotel affiliations. Originally we were booked into another hotel, booked via EasyJet, which we were told was central to everything in Istanbul, but was actually miles away as we discovered after researching. Trying to organise accommodation with the hotel from Australia was a nightmare. You couldn't complain about their service, there wasn't any. And we were just trying to alter a check-in day. Eventually after experiencing their appalling service, we were told that we had to cancel via EasyJet. Their attempt at 'service' was also appalling. Eventually we had to cancel the hotel and the flight (with penalties) then rebook the flight (which we missed at Luton, London by 30 seconds due to traffic jams and road works - but that is another story). In the meantime I had researched hotels in Istanbul, which brought me to the tripadvisor site. (If I had to go overseas or travel again I would not book anything until I had spent time on tripadvisor reading the comments of other travellers). I came across the Hotel Sapphire and after reading other reviews I contacted the hotel directly and booked in. From the initial point of contact in Australia and until the time we left we were thoroughly impressed with the Hotel Sapphire. As a person who has managed hotels for many years I would have no hesitation in employing all the staff. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone looking for exceptional value for money. It's not the Hilton but its not far off, and for a lot less money. I encourage potential travellers to read the other reviews on this wonderful hotel and then experience their level of service yourself. Enjoy your stay in Istanbul.

I have never regretted my decision. So, here are some details. LOCATION: As everyone says, you're in the center of many of the main attractions. The hotel is wonderfully located between Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc (harbour) and Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosk etc. You have easy access to the tram, 200m to the stop, which makes it also very easy to get to the airport in around 1 hour. STAFF: Every member of the staff was very polite and friendly, as are the Istanbulers in general. More important, they are real 'professionals'. The reservation, the e-mail contact, the pick-up service from the airport: everything worked out fine. The higher staff members speak good English, at least one of them even German! ROOM: I recommend to ask for one the renovated rooms (mine was 318, single), where I found nothing to complain about, as in fact other people in this forum did. The room was very clean (albeit a little too small) with useful equipment like safe, refrigerator (i.e. mini bar), tea/coffee facility (which wasn't refilled) and sat tv (lousy picture). The bathroom was large, especially the shower. As already stated for the tv, the technical equipment didn't work too well, which didn't cause any problems for me. E.g. the roll mounting for the toilet paper came of the wall, the hairdryer's tube wouldn't stay in its mounting (could use it, though) and twice the keycard had to be recharged, which obviously happens at odd times. All but minor problems really. An annoyance might occur (but in my case didn't) because of the badly soundproofed walls. BREAKFAST: The room is large enough and very comfortable. I really cannot see the point in many of the complaints about the breakfast, which I found to be very good indeed, especially when considering that this is a mediterranean country. In fact, there was a good variety of food for most tastes - healthy stuff alongside fat makers. Important for me: they have good and fresh bread, as indeed throughout Istanbul. The coffee from the machine is horrible, so take my advice and ask for nescoffee, which they will get for you from the kitchen and which is alright - enough for getting kickstarted in the morning. CONCLUSION: To be sure, this is not a 4 star hotel, but one is getting good value for money (I paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 65,- per day).

Positives: Very convenient and quiet location in Sultanahmet area (on a pedestrian street), between 10 to 15 minutes walk to Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. Pretty and clean rooms with nice modern bathrooms. The rooms were small (smaller than I expected) but still adequate in size. Nice indoor swimming pool (with a spa area) and a sauna, which are rare for hotels of this range in such central location. We used it every day after our trips around Istanbul and always enjoyed it! Free one-way transfer from Ataturk airport if booked directly from the hotel, which we did. Helpful staff on the reception and also helpful maids and breakfast staff. Free wireless Internet. Some negatives (not big ones): My first room was at the back of the hotel on the 4th floor. I liked it from the minute I saw it. Unfortunately, there was some wall on the right side a few metres away (I think it was the neighbouring building) and there were lots of air conditioners on this wall, which made some noise at night. Probably it wouldn't bother people who sleep with windows shut, but I like to keep the windows open instead of running aircon for a whole night, and we live in a quiet area at home, so this noise a bit disturbed my sleep that night. In the morning I asked the reception to change my room and they did it without any problems. The room I moved in was on the 1st floor on the front of the building and, again, it was a very nice room. The only problem was a slight sewage smell in the bathroom. I mentioned it to the maid and she tried to do something while we were out, but it didn't make much difference. I didn't want to change my room again because I really liked my room otherwise, so I didn't bother mentioning it again. One person on the reception made me feel like I was a bit hassling him every time when I was asking or requesting something. He probably didn't mean to do it but still did. They have a very nice parrot in a lobby, but the cage is too small for its size, so I felt sorry for this parrot. I hope they will buy it a bigger cage. Wireless Internet didn't work properly most of the time while we were there, but I only mentioned it to the reception staff on our last day, so they were probably unaware of the problem. We ordered a transfer to the airport from the hotel and had to curry our bags to the next street, as the street where the hotel is located is pedestrian. They spared us one member of staff to help with bags, but we didn't want to be unfare to him and didn't give him more than one suitcase (so had to curry 2 other suitcases ourselves). But, I suppose, they didn't have to help us with the bags, so to spare anyone to help was already good. On the whole, it was a very comfortable stay in a very convenient location and we enjoyed staying at this hotel. We would stay there again and would definitely recommend it to everyone else.", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lausanne", "Title": "\u201cTurkish Delight\u201d", "Author": "kissmeiamitalian", "ReviewID": "UR19958716", "Content": "To be sincere, if you want to visit Istanbul as a first time the location is perfect.

The room was tastefully decorated, very clean and modern, tv (not that we had time to watch it!), bar fridge and the hotel had also set up a camp cot for our toddler.
