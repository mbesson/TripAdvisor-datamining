It is very relaxing, and is located in a nice area not far away from the Central Station and major sites like Brandenburg Gate and Richstag. It's a completely new property with great and innovative design, especially I liked the \"fireplace\" on the TV screens in the lobby and the rooms. Friendly and helpful staff. People who stay there are mostly business travelers. Very nice breakfast for cheap price, and this price also includes the use of wifi. The only minus was: the towels weren't changed every day, so rather put them on the floor if you want clean ones. Other than that, everything else was perfect. Every night I couldn't wait to return to my Berlin home, and if I ever return back to Berlin this is where I will stay.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trinidad", "Title": "\u201cGreat design, no fuss, no frills\u201d", "Author": "RAJ51", "ReviewID": "UR121924078", "Content": "Up to date, modern design in spartan (no coffe pot, no iron, no telephone, no cupboard, no drawers) accomodation at a reasonable price.

The rooms are really great, with comfortable beds and flat screen tv. Staff was always helpful and friendly. Breakfast is your European standard cheese and meat and muesli affair, no complaints. Motel One has eliminated a few frills that you will probably not miss -- there are no in-room phones, for example. So if you want to reach another guest, you need to leave a message at reception or get their mobile number. No big deal. The only tiny fly in the ointment is that you are not exactly in the center of the action at this location. You're only a few minutes walk from an S-Bahn station, but if you are planning some late nights enjoying Berlin's legendary nightlife, you will be shelling out for taxis to take you back to the hotel. If you're not much for nightlife then you will find it hard to find better value for money than Motel One Bellevue in Berlin. And even if you are a partier, a few taxis is not so bad -- from this hotel to Kreuzberg is about 15 EUR.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canadian abroad", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, great location\u201d", "Author": "singlefemale", "ReviewID": "UR91878394", "Content": "Loved the concept of motel one - I wish there were more around the world.

The location suited me but the immediate surroundings are not very fashionable and there's not a large choice of places to eat on the doorstep.

The hotel was really impressive on first appearance for it's rating, exceptionally modern and clean being such a new hotel. The staff on reception were extremely helpful (free WIFI in the lobby with a code from the staff on front desk) and the pamphlets in reception that have the metro system map in were invaluable for us, having never been to Berlin before. Berlin has an extremely efficient tranportation system! A note to point is that the hotel is in a fairly residential location and the walking journey from Bellevue station, the closest (5 minutes at most across the river to the right), would be quite daunting for single travellers on first sight, as you walk alongside the railway arches, which can be quite dark in evening, but we did not experience any trouble. In fact when we arrived there late there was a little cafe opposite and the owner russled us up a fine supper, I'm vegetarian and was surprised with how tasty it was, couldn't tell you it's exact name though! My partner, a meat eater, well he was equally impressed at the service at such a late hour!) Furthermore, location wise in the day, you are but a 10 min walk to the Brandenburg Gate, we did the journey daily, and nightly, after the magnificent New Years Eve celebrations! As for the rooms, they were modern, very clean, fairly compact with a fantastic shower! The only downside for us was that the walls must have been very thin as we were well aware of all the goings in the next room and we all like a bit of fun but hearing it while trying to sleep is not perfect! Take your ear plugs! Also, a valuable scarf of mine went missing from the room, the reception staff were obviously keen to return it but to no avail, we've no proof what happened there but just be aware. Apart from that, super hotel and we would stay again if we couldn't find something nearer to Hackescher Markt ( 5 mins from Bellevue by Metro) where we spent some time in the lovely Italian restaurants and bars/clubs (there's not that many and people aren't dressed to impress like UK nights out by the way, the girls mainly wore trousers/leggings, dresses skirts with thick tights and flat boots shin/knee and thigh high for the clubs we found, which is no problem but it's nice to know I guess!) Do make sure you take really comfortable boots/shoes to walk around in by day also, especially if visitng the many sights. The German Christmas Markets everywhere were extra special if visiting at the same time of year as we did!
