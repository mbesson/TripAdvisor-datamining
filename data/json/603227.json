{"Reviews": [{"Content": "GREAT HOTEL FOR THE PRICE! Amazing value for the price. I booked the hotel for a group of 14 28-30yr olds. We paid 8000 yen per person, per night. Originally, i was apprehensive as the reviews on other sites had this at a 2 star hotel but once we got there, we quickly realized this was a great find. I'd say it's about a 3-3.5 star hotel. Rooms were big (compared with Tokyo standards). VERY comfortable beds, very clean and the location is unbelievable. It's about a 5 min walk from the Shibuya crossing. My parents stayed at a 5 star hotel (cerulean tokyo tower) but when they saw our room, they wished they stayed there (half the price at hotel mets).full bathrooms, flat screen TV and breakfast was included (although no one in our group made it for breakfast as we were out till 5 am every night).hope this helps!", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR464352814", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ghel0050"}, {"Content": "Shibuya!

If you want to get a coffee and watch people at Tokyo's most famous crossroad. Staff is helpfull, speaks english. Rate is standard for Tokyo, 20% off with a JR pass. A bit difficult to find, follow the signs in the JR station new south exit. Breakfast is included. Good deal if you want a super clean, brand new room.
