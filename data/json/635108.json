We took Gaia's advice and took a taxi from the train station. We were arriving quite late and were weary travellers. The taxi ride was entertaining to say the least. Rome's traffic is one big game of \"chicken\". Francesco was there to meet us and quickly checked us in with directions to the nearest grocery store so that we could get some provisions for breakfast. The apartment is exactly as shown. There is a handly little washing machine. No dryer. Microwave, hot plates, fridge, ice, no basics on hand such as salt, sugar, tea - cupboards were bare on our visit. Larger than I expected. Housekeeping every day. That was a pleasant surprise. In a very safe and central neighborhood where you can shop and eat with the locals, but still be within walking distance of all the fabulous tourist sites. We walked everywhere - Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Colosseum and Vatican. The Campo de Fiori and Palazzo Navona are right around the corner and a great place to people watch, dine, and just hang out. In saying that, I also have to say that the apartment is very very quiet at night. Although there was a great TV with a bazillion channels, none were English, however, I was able to tap into someone's wireless, so we were able to catch up on world news. Gaia arranged a driver to take us to the airport. Again, that was a wild ride. It's just the Roman way.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "charlottesville, virginia", "Title": "\u201cNo Need to be Rude\u201d", "Author": "attorneytraveler", "ReviewID": "UR10055757", "Content": "We just returned from italy, where we spent the last two nights in Rome. We did not actually stay at the Campo Di Fiori because we were told that they had never received the faxed confirmation. While we were disappointed, these problems sometimes happen in travel and we were prepared to find another place to stay. The employee at the front desk, however, continued to be extremely rude when we asked for his suggestions for another hotel, insisting that any problem was our fault.. As we were awaiting a taxi, another woman came to register. When she was given rooms on the top floor, we overheard her tell the same clerk that she had requested rooms on the first floor because she was with her elderly mother who was recovering from cancer. The clerk was also rude to her. Thank heavens there was no room at this hotel. We will never be attempting to book it in the future.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Value": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, but a bit for a Spartan in Rome\u201d", "Author": "PieterdeN", "ReviewID": "UR7711106", "Content": "We stayed in Rome for a week with our 4 grown-up children and used both apartments. Note that there are only double beds available, so that might be a problem in some cases, not in ours, fortunately. Indeed the 3rd floor apartment is quite noisy at night and in the early morning (6.45-7.15) when the garbage collectors come around. However, the 2nd floor apartment has less of such problems as the windows open up to the opposite of the building. Expect an early morning call (7.30) by the same garbage collectors to open the door. The bathrooms are a bit Spartan and no soaps etc are provided for. The price seems over the top (\u20ac 90 pp) for such a studio, but one pays for the location, within 100m from the Campo de' Fiori and right in the epicentre of all of Rome's highlights in walking distance is a boon. There are hardly or no other hotels in the surroundings, but one may expect this to cange in the future. I would search the next time for an alternative place close by, but if not available, I would happily settle down again.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cgreat studio\u201d", "Author": "wakeboarders", "ReviewID": "UR7553040", "Content": "We stayed in this studio right by the campo de fiori square for 2 nights and really enjoyed it. We were on the top floor and there is no elevator so you will have to carry your bags up 3 flights of stairs, but once you make the climb you will find a very comfortable studio suite. They have another studio one floor down which is very similar and nice as well. They allowed us to choose which we wanted as we showed up first, so we picked the upper suite because it was a little brighter, but the other studio was very nice as well. The shower is quite small which was not a problem for us, but might be for larger people. Everything was very clean. We really only used the fridge, but the kitchenette seemed to have everything you might need. No microwave but it did have a hot plate. The only downside to this suite is the noise at night. There is a restaurant right downstairs and it is very noisy at night. We used earplugs and had drinks with dinner everynight, so it was not too bad for us, but if you are a light sleeper, I would probably not recommend this studio. The location was excellent. We walked everywhere from the studio. The bus stop to the unit is probably a 5 - 10 minute walk.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Capo di Ferro", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d635108-Reviews-Capo_di_Ferro-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$132 - $211*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piazza Capo di Ferro 20</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00186</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "635108", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/52/00/5200b2672e84302f04ed24dccf0ce3eb1large.jpg"}}
