The lobboy of the hotel was under renovation and the parking lot was being re-surfaced. This really did not present a problem to us accept the fact that our room was close to the lobby and the construction noise started around 8 am. The doors are paper thin and you could hear every word said just outside our doors. This part of the Hollywood Blvd is a bit dicey. We walked to the center the first night there and it took us at least 30 minutes to briskly walk to the Kodak theater and other attractions. On the way there, the kids were spooked more than once by the homeless people and other mentally unstable individuals. We did not try to walk there again. Since we only paid $69/night for this hotel, I think we got a great deal. The room was clean and the murral on the wall was a nice touch. The bathroom area (shower) can use some TLC, but it was not too bad for the motel type place.

That it has nicely remodeled rooms is another plus. Our room was clean and comfortable, and it gave us a great headquarters for visiting Hollywood. If you don't want to deal with city parking, the Metro is very convenient. I recommend that you ask for a room on the upper floor. We were on the first floor and heard plenty of thumps from the people above us. Also, the rooms aren't huge, so if you're traveling with a group or packing along several kids, it might get a little crowded in a hurry. But for a couple or a small family, there's plenty of room. Note that the hotel is in the heart of Thai Town. If you like Thai food, you're in heaven. If you don't (like us), then don't plan on walking to a restaurant. But there's no shortage of food choices within a few minutes of driving or a Metro stop in any direction. All in all, for the price, the remodeled rooms and the parking, I felt it was a solid value in a town not known for values.

The hotel itself isn't in the best of locations, its address is 'Hollywood Boulevard' but in reality Hollywood Boulevard is sooo long it would be worth paying a bit more to make sure you had a closer hotel to the attractions (takes about 20 mins to walk to the walk of fame from here) It was also in quite a rough area, with not many restaurants nearby (apart from one nice diner pretty much next door) luckily we had a car but if you don't then it would be annoying for you if you wanted to just go out for dinner etc. The hotel room had enough space for the 4 of us, and was really clean and a housekeeping service was provided everyday. There is free wi-fi provided and free breakfast in the morning, the breakfast was the likes of toast, cereal, waffles etc, but in a small room which does get really busy.

I knew the place from a previous stay in 1998, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conveniently located for Universal Studios and other Hollywood attractions. The neighborhood is not the same as 12 years ago though. Rooms: We got the one on the corner, 212, just facing the stairs, looking east at an empty parking lot. Maybe less noisier than the rest of the rooms as it does not directly face the street.

The housekeeping ladies did a good job everyday, replacing towels and replenishing coffee, soap and shampoo. I'm not the guy looking for biological matter of any origin every time I rent a room in a motel, so for me it was OK. Of course there were stains on chairs and carpets, and after 3 days spider webs and human hair become more visible, but it's a less than 70 dollars (although they charge over 90 on weekends) a night motel in the middle of Hollywood, what else can you expect!

Rooms have microwave and a refrigerator and coffee machine. Old 29\" TV and no cable channels. Desk and two chairs. AC not noisy. BREAKFAST: toasts, butter, jam, waffles, cereal, milk, coffee and apple and orange juice. Low quality food in every sense. In a room behind the front desk not holding more than 12 persons at a time.

Doesn't work at all. Had to go to the lobby and even there connecting to hotmail was difficult. There was a young obese clerk who seemed to live there, as I saw him all the time. I complained about needing to fix the internet in the rooms and he went....DEFINITIVELY!! I really loved his cynism! In other words....yeah....right! They have a PC for guests on the lobby. PARKING: Free, but I think there are not enough spots for all rooms, so arriving late at night could be troublesome. As safety concerns, better take everything out of your car I saw homeless people coming out of the parking lot. It seems normal as judged from the reaction of the front desk people: nothing. Meaning that anybody can lurk around unnoticed in the middle of the night. Gates are open 24 hours a day\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6oops sorry\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there are no gates. POOL, open from 9 'til 10, I don't think anybody would use it unless at the end of a hot summer day. It's separated from the street by a less than 1,80 meter tall wall. No privacy at all. The \"pool furniture\" looks as purchased in a garage sale from the 60's. PRICE: we got a good deal staying for three nights, but I wouldn't stay longer than one. Internet rate was 65 dollars + tax a night for three nights starting Sunday, upon arrival they told me 79, can leave it at 75. Only after showing the internet rate they said OK. But 91 dollars+ tax for a Saturday night stay? Hotel taxes in California are 12%. They also requested a 50 dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deposit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in my credit card\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..in case you destroy something in the room the obese clerk said\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a true example in customer service\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and he was teaching others!!! LOCATION: if you don't have a car, it's next door to a subway station. East of 101 highway, the neighborhood has definitively no fancy Hollywood flavor. It's around 45 minutes walking distance from the closest stars of the Hall of Fame. RALPHS supermarket across the street, a diner next door and some Thai places nearby. If you have a car, 10 minutes from Universal Studios, 5 minutes from Griffiths Park. FACILITIES: laundry room, washing machine ($1.00) and dryer ($0.50) but no detergent, so bring yours or rush to Ralphs for your 70 oz minimum available size detergent box. How much money would a detergent dispenser cost? Ice machine, $ 0.25. 90% of the guests here stay one night so it's obvious the management does not really care about making this place better. For one night, it's OK, if your staying more, invest a couple more dollars and go somewhere else.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aarhus, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cso so\u201d", "Author": "tigers-ol", "ReviewID": "UR83618238", "Content": "Stayed 4 nights here in early october as a base to explore LA.

I've stayed here the past few years from time to time. Price was ok, rooms clean but basic. Never saw any bugs. However, my last trip put me off this place for good! I was placed next to room that was undergoing construction and also had very noisy neighbors (adults talking loud every morning). Late Sat night (11PM) they came back to the room drunk and with a group of friends. Extremely noisy. Called down twice to front desk, they didn't bother the first time, then they came and told everyone to be quiet. Didn't help. Another guest on the other side of that room also called the front desk. Noise continued, they were extremely drunk. I serioously thought of calling the cops. Finally around 3AM they started to get unusually quiet. That's when I started to smell something strange coming from the common door between the rooms, marijuana! As much as I wanted to call the front desk or even the cops, I didn't want any trouble for myself so I put pillows at the bottom of that door, covered my face and tried to sleep. Finally went to sleep around 4:30AM, I was supposed to be up at 6AM! Around 8AM, a friend of the noisy neighbors came to their room and started banging on their door and calling them, when they didn't answer, he went to housekeeping who then decided it may be the wrong room and opened mine instead! No knock on my door, just someone opening it with a key without my consent! Luckily I had the deadbolt on it. When I checked out, the lady at the front counter apologized for the night (she wasn't the night person on duty) and gave me a discount on the room. It really should've been free but I was to tired to fight the issue. I left promising myself I would never return! Location is great if you want to be in Hollywood, close to Graumann's, etc. However, the area is really bad now. There's always people hanging around very late at night. They had a security guard out in the parking lot on Friday night; they should also have one on Saturdays.

I needed a place for three nights to sleep and do some work in the evenings for three nights. My criteria were simple: clean, comfortable. economical, and in a convenient location (as my meetings were all around the L.A. area). This Day's Inn hit the mark on all fronts (though the maid service could have been better). Reading all the recent reviews I had serious second thoughts about this hotel, so only booked for one night and had a back-up booked for the next two nights. With regard to the bad review comments: I did find one cockroach in the bathroom when I arrived, but the little critter was quite dead (so the exterminator had done his work), and saw none dead or alive since. (It's an old building in the middle of the city, so an occasional roach should not be a shock to any experienced traveler, especially if it's already dead). The first room I was given was a bit shabby (the rugs were older and stained here and there and the bed covers a bit threadbare in spots) and the rugs could have been cleaner (like the maid never bothered to vacuum close to the walls or corners), but the bathroom was spotless and overall cleanliness satisfactory. As I could not connect to the Internet from that room, I asked to be moved to a room closer to the office, and much to my surprise this room was two stars higher in quality: new bathroom with granite sink and contemporary shower curtain, upscale (almost former Marriott quality) bedding with sophisticated matching window treatments (not just curtains). Rest of room was pretty standard. My only criticism would be that management must have low standards as even though much of the room was newly remodeled, no one ever bothered to do the finishing touch cleanup (i.e., cleaning up the excess caulking around the granite or the paint smudges off the shower fixtures, and again, getting the maids to vacuum thoroughly). The location for foreign tourists (who tend not to rent cars) is convenient to bus service and less than a half block to the metro entrance. For motorists the entrance to the Hlywd Freeway (101) is also a half block away and though no business or tourist sites are walking distance, you can't beat the location (less than 20 minutes to Burbank and the TV and movie studios there, Universal Studios, downtown L.A., Hollywood tourist sites, etc. More convenient yet is that you are in the middle of \"Thai Town\", a restaurant destination for locals, with dozens of authentic Thai eating establishments in every price range and that serve late even on week nights. Also nearby is a Quiznos, Cold Stone Creamery, large Ralph's supermarket and more, so you never need to travel if you're hungry. In conclusion, NO, this is not up to the standards of a newer suburban or Interstate highway exit Day's Inn, and it's nowhere close to a Marriott Courtyard or even a Hampton Inn, but it is also half the price, and at $65-$80 on average for a room, quite a value compared to most anything else around", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cgood for budget travelors\u201d", "Author": "ntndz", "ReviewID": "UR10074752", "Content": "Very nice hotel for my week-long stay.

But for peace and quiet--\"get off the boulevard.\"", "Date": "April 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad choice\u201d", "Author": "minicooperdownunder", "ReviewID": "UR4127893", "Content": "Stayed for the 3rd time in 16 months for 2 nights 10/5 & 10/6, previously stayed June 2004 & March 2005. Good choice for budget accommodation under US$50 per night via the Days Inn website. Rooms are ok, clean enough and all have had a fridge and one a microwave which is handy as there is a Ralphs grocery store opposite in a shopping complex that has a few cafes and Starbucks. Even though the address is Hollywood Blvd it is east of the Hollywood freeway and the area east isn't the tourist part it's in a part they call Thai Town so if you are into Thai food would be a good choice. Don't know if I would like to walk around the local streets at night but during the day and going over the road to Starbucks was never a problem. As with staying anywhere in Los Angeles you need a car and while there is free parking if you get back late at night the parking lot can be pretty full, I never had a problem but once or twice I got the last spot. A continental breakfast in a room off the lobby is included just basic stuff but enough to start the day and they have a pool.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ludlow, Shropshire", "Title": "\u201cGive it a miss\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3987828", "Content": "Stayed here for first 5 nights of our 5 weeks holiday travelling around the west coast of the states.

We had booked three nights hoping to base here for visiting Universal Studios and Hollywood. On our visit to the USA we had stayed in a good number of other hotels so on arrival we were not surprised by the location right by the very busy and noisy Hollywood Boulevard. But on entering our room we were simply astonished and appalled. Apart from a bed, TV, chair and bathroom there were no other 'facilities'. There was nowhere to hang clothes and little room to have suitcases open. Plug sockets looked unsafe as some were hanging out of the wall. Then my wife inspected the bed. There were 'soiled' tissues under the bottom sheet. The bed and room smelt of smoke (non-smoking room). The room was dirty.The bathroom had not been properly cleaned and the toilet.......(don't ask !) When leaving the room to speak to reception I was stopped by a woman who was begging - on the hotel property ! We just couldn't stay a moment longer. The receptionist seemed unfazed by our complaint and refunded the 2nd and 3rd nights payment but was unable to refund for the first night. Although not happy with this - we had only been in the room for 10 minutes - we had to accept as we just wanted to get away. This hotel is just awful. There appear to be no housekeeping standards, the hotel description on the Days Inn web site is far from satifactory. Anybody thinking of staying here other than as a hostel equivalent should give it a very wide berth.", "Date": "June 6, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Dixie Hollywood", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d239812-Reviews-The_Dixie_Hollywood-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$124 - $180*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5410 Hollywood Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Hollywood</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90027</span></span> (Formerly Days Inn Hollywood)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "239812", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e4/29/e429aa0002e612b9e07f192d1fcbc5e210large.jpg"}}
