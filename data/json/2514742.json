The service was outstanding with staff recommending good restaurants, recommending and booking our show & rivercruise and completing our on-line flight check-in for us. The room wasn't huge, but certainly big enough. Great attention to detail in the decor...it felt like Paris should!!, it was spotless and the bed really comfortable. The bathroom was better than other 3 star hotels (even some 4 star hotels) we have stayed at before. The only negative experience would have been that I couldn't have an iron & ironing board in my room (due to safety reasons they said, not something I've come across before and we travel a lot), and the ironing lady had already left for the day. I'll just remember to bring my travel iron next time as we will most definitely return.

We had 2 traditional rooms, which were small but spotless and very well designed. The beds were comfortable and clean. The bathroom was a decent size with a good shower and a small cabinet which was handy to keep all your toiletries in (especially with 2 girls sharing!) The wardrobe was much bigger than most Paris hotels I\u2019ve stayed in and there were plenty of mirrors. We also had a nice view over Paris rooftops from our window- which looked even better as we got clear blue skies and sunshine throughout our stay. I have been to Paris many times before and stayed in the Latin Quarter the most as I think it\u2019s the nicest area of Paris. The hotel is named as Saint Germain, but it is definitely closer to Montparnasse, not that this is a bad thing. I have never stayed here and would definitely go back, plenty of restaurants, nice shops and good travel links to the rest of the city. You don\u2019t lose any of the charm of the Saint Germain area. The hotel was very quiet, it has no bar or restaurant etc. But you can get all that in the surrounding area anyway. The staff were fine, not rude, but not overly nice. We didn\u2019t pay for the breakfast, so I can\u2019t comment on that, but the breakfast room was lovely. There are plenty of places nearby to grab a croissant or bread roll. The Aviatic provides a great base to come back to sleep and get ready for the day- all you want from a city hotel!

I was able to be fully caffeinated before starting my day. Our two rooms were quite different in decor and lighting. The full size bed for two was very well lit, with a decent sized bathroom. Our room which slept three was a bit darker, and would have loved a bit more light over the head of the bed to read, but only a minor issue. Could have used another open plug or two, but all-in-all a very nice room. Wine in the room was reasonably priced as well. Rooms were quite clean and tasteful. Location is certainly within walking distance to the main sights, but is a bit of a walk (which I like to do). When we didn't want to walk, the metro was only a block away (around the corner), so was quite convenient, although unless you had a refillable pass, you will need to purchase at a different station.

However, it proved a very good \u2013 and good value \u2013 discovery. The only slight downside was the location. When arriving by Eurostar, we usually stay in the heart of St Germain, which is a rather dull ten or fifteen minutes walk away from the Aviatic (the long Rue Vaugirard being particularly bleak), so we used the metro much more than usual (buying the so-called \u201cMobilis\u201d day passes, so that we didn\u2019t have to worry how many journeys we made). This aside, we were delighted with the stay. For a start, the online non-refundable room rate of 170 Euros which we paid for a superior category room was roughly half what we might otherwise have paid for hotels nearer Saint Germain and both the room and the twin beds were larger than we have typically known, with excellent mattresses and duvets. The double glazing was very effective in blocking street noises and the (relatively rare in France) fact that the air-conditioning was still usable in winter made it easy to regulate the temperature without opening windows. The decor cleverly combined modern fabrics and materials with a period feel appropriate to the building. Sheets and towels were changed daily and the bathroom products generously topped up. The bath (in room 134) was really too small to be used as such, but the shower above it was vigorous, if hard to adjust. The breakfast buffet (14 Euros) managed to cram a large range of choices into a very small serving area. The freshly made coffees from the machine were excellent, as were the breads, jams (perhaps homemade \u2013 certainly served as though they were), comp\u00f4tes and pastries. There were also yoghurts, cold meats and cheeses, which we didn\u2019t try. As others have noted, though, the breakfast room is tiny, making it hard to squeeze through to the buffet, when the room is busy. No doubt to ease the pressure, the hotel offers a simpler breakfast in the rooms at 8 Euros, but the furniture in our room didn\u2019t really lend itself to this. The reception staff were helpful with restaurant confirmations and the like; and generous touches included the complimentary bottle of red Bordeaux in the room and the \u201chelp-yourself\u201d carafes of wine and nibbles in the hallway in the evenings (though, sadly, the white wine proved undrinkable!). The garage accommodation was an individual lock-up inside the parking area (itself also locked) for a block of flats on the opposite side of the road, so total piece of mind. Quite tight, however, for a largish car, so check this when you book the parking. (I think the hotel has two of these spaces.) All in all, if the prices remain keen, we may well switch our allegiance for future visits to Paris.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "Belleblossom", "ReviewID": "UR120879191", "Content": "I just came home after a stay at the Aviatic, and I am very pleased. Where to start.. One of the best things about the hotel is the decor/interiour. Even though it is just a three-star, you get the feeling that this hotel is a more exclusive three-star. In fact, it reminded me of a four-star I stayed on a while ago... And seriously, there are a lot of ugly three-stars out there, so watch out! The housekeeping was excellent. The cleaned or room every single day, brought us fresh towels and arranged or belongings so that everything looked spotless when we came home from shopping all day. SO nice!. Other that that I loved the fact that you could order french breakfast in the room for only 8\u20ac! Smooth! The receptionists also did an excellent job.. As to the location, I would say the the hotel is closer to Montparnasse than Saint Germain. Well, well. As we have been to Paris many times, using the metrosystem is easypeasy, and there are several stations not far from the hotel. Funny: - Some people stated that the rooms were small. To that I have to say: \"Have you ever been in Paris? Rooms are small. End of story!

An added advantage was the hotel lift - after a day walking round Paris, walking up the stairs to the 4th floor wasn't an appealing prospect! In conclusion, I would describe the Aviatic Hotel as a stylish, welcoming hotel that is full of Parisian charm. It is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and feels more like a four star hotel than a three star.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "RenataEggplant", "ReviewID": "UR116703899", "Content": "Excellent hotel , good location in a quiet street.

First of all, note that this hotel is located in the Montparnasse area (14e) despite being marketed as in the St. Germain area (6e). The address is technically 6th district but it is really part of the Montparnasse district, which is touristy and not the charming 6th district, which is what I expected. However, it is close to 2 subway stations and therefore easy for you to get around. The facilities are nice. The rooms are small but cozy and the bathrooms were very clean. It is the service that I have a complaint about, and which has turned me off from considering going back or recommending this place. To summarize, the staff is indifferent and unhelpful. When my Air France shuttle bus (as recommended by their website) wouldn't come, I thought to call the hotel concierge for some tips. They simply said, the bus is quicker than the subway. Full stop. After over an hour of waiting, I then decided there was no option other than the train, and so 4.5 hours later, I finally got to this hotel. When I got there there were, I had to wait a good while before any of the staff members even bothered looking at me and greeting me. When I checked out, I asked for a a late check out and they said it was impossible. I then asked for a 30minute extension and they said, \"no more than that.\" Throughout my stay, I cannot say that they are rude per se, as they are usually courteous. But the courtesy is insincere and cold. They are impersonal and unhelpful. I had read somewhere that this place has been running for over 100 years and so, was expecting some friendliness -- I found zero. I had very little expectation of service in France to begin with, but this place really exceeded my expectations, in the reverse direction. In retrospect, I would have preferred to have stayed at a hostel where it would have been much cheaper and where at least I would have found some friendliness from staff or other travelers. I am very sorry I chose this hotel on my first trip to Paris as it certainly left a sour taste in my mouth and put a damper on my impression of this beautiful city. If you are looking for a clean place to stay with easy access to subways (but not the best area), this may be the place for you. If you are looking for charm and service from a hotel, I do not recommend the Aviatic Hotel.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "vb80", "ReviewID": "UR102127354", "Content": "Very nice hotel, all the staff were very nice, welcoming and helpful.

Even worse, after we returned home, the hotel manager did email us to apologize and offer to cover the cost of the taxi, but then we never heard back from them, we waited for several months checking visa statements for a refund that never came, we even told him that he didn't have to worry about covering the entire taxi bill but just the difference from the shuttle... there were a couple of other minor issues, but this was the main one that I felt important to share with other travellers.

In addition, their suggestions regarding to visiting places and common practices of staying in Paris were always useful and accurate. Regrettably we do not speak French, but it did not seem to be the problem, since the people at the reception speak an excellent English. They also seemed to be happy with our attempts to produce at least a couple of common French words and phrases.

The subway stations are 5 minutes away from the hotel (there are several choices). From the corner of the street you can see the Tour Eiffel, beautiful at night. The area is packed with nice restaurants, very affordable, so it is not a problem to grab a bite or a drink. The lobby of the hotel is cozy and warm. There is a small room for breakfast, nicely decorated with old posters. In the evenings, they offer complimentary wine and snacks. Also, another room with a nice fireplace, to sit down while waiting for somebody. You will find too a tiny Internet room, with a MAC computer and printer. To use it, you need to buy prepaid cards at the desk. A tiny elevator takes you to the rooms. I upgraded mine. It wasn\u2019t very big but more than enough for myself and very cozy. Hardwood floors, which I prefer to carpet. Big bed, extremely comfortable (having arthritis I am pretty sensitive to those things). Extra pillows and blankets. A/C . A writing desk. A window I could actually open and enjoy the fresh air and the street sounds. Flat screen TV, mini bar. A very comfortable couch. The bathroom was very well designed. I liked the Italian shower and I like the cabinet to store my toilet items. The complimentary toiletteries (soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, body moisturizer) had a great quality. The mini bar was expensive, as with all the hotels, as it was the laundry service. There is Wi-fi but you need to pay for it, this is perhaps the only thing I did not like. For the laundry, near to the hotel there is a coin-operated Laundromat, pretty cheap (Rue Mayet). The breakfast buffet is nice, 14 Euros. Fresh squeezed orange juice, cold cuts, croissants, pastries, coffee\u2026 I found the quality of the food correct. The breakfast room feels a little bit cramped, though.

We had a lovely room on the 6th Floor which had a Juliette balcony overlooking the street. The room felt like it had all been recently refurbished, with contemporary decor, wooden floors and a nice modern shower room. The room was a bit small but perfectly formed! The hotel staff (who all speak English) were really helpful, especially as I sprained my ankle on our last night there (Easter Sunday) and needed to see an emergency doctor. They arranged everything and had a doctor come to my room at 12.30 at night with no hassle to me whatsoever. Apart from this little drama - the staff had also been very helpful with advice on sight-seeing etc as well. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from a couple of Metro Stations and is on the Metro Line 4 which connects to all the major tourist attractions so its really convenient. We didnt have the hotel breakfast as we thought it was quite expensive (14\u20ac per person) and the breakfast room is a bit small. I think you get a reasonable amount of choice, but for those who just want a coffee and croissant - there are some great cafe's in the area that provide simpler and more cost effective options (about 6\u20ac per person instead)! Paris is an expensive city and this hotel is also pretty pricey. I guess what I would say though is that in Paris you can stay somewhere expensive and average or expensive and nice and The Aviatic is definitely in the latter category.

The common areas of the hotel are pretty, so it's a shame that the same attention hadn't been paid to my room. The photos on the hotel website are very deceptive and nothing like the reality - I'd paid extra for a \"superior\" room, yet it looked like a slightly chinztier version of a travelodge. Very sparse and a bit shabby. The room also stank of smoke, despite the hotel claiming it was a no smoking room. We asked for another room, but the one we were shown was dark and dingy with two single beds rather than a double, so we stuck with the smoky room. At least it was quite light, none more so than at night, when the sign outside the hotel illuminated the room. It was also quite noisy - not too bad with the windows closed, but you couldn't open them and bear the noise for long. The hotel charge for wifi access - 8 euro for 1 hour, 24 euro for 1 day. I thought this unneccessarily high, and mean when one is paying 190 euro a night for a room. Perhaps worst of all though, was the attitude of the staff. We asked for an iron to be sent up to the room, and were told this was not possible. We asked if there was a laundry room where we could use an iron, as we had a suitcase of clothes that needed pressing (my partner was there for a business meeting). They said no, but they had a laundry service that could press them (8 euros per shirt...) Eventually they agreed to press 3 items for free. 1 came back unironed, 1 badly ironed, 1 ok. Upon checking out, they tried to charge us for this pressing. When we explained that a member of staff had offered to press 3 items free of charge, the receptionist argued, denied it, and was incredibly rude and aggressive. He claimed that there is a french law that states irons are not permitted in hotel rooms - curious then, that I've come across several people who've recently had irons in their Paris hotel rooms. Perhaps a ploy to get us to use their expensive yet not very good laundry service? Eventually, he called the manager who agreed to \"waive\" the charge. It was a thoroughly upsetting and stressful end to our stay. All in all, a most unsatisfactory hotel, and I can't really understand why it's rated so highly on tripadvisor.

Fortunately, you don't spend much time in your room during the day. However, light sleepers take note: the Metro starts running at 5am and sounds as if it runs directly under the hotel. However, you will be exhausted from sightseeing by day two and will learn to sleep through the hum of the train. Our room was clean and pleasant, though a bit shabby and needed updating. It looks as though that has been done recently. The bathroom was small and efficient and very clean, with nice soaps and shampoos which I promptly stuffed in my bag in hopes of getting more the next day (what luck, they were replenished!). I was reluctant to book this hotel from the mixed reviews, but glad I did in the end. It is a nice hotel in a good neighborhood away from all the tourists. It is plenty close to several major Metro stops and in close vicinity to a lovely corner-diner type cafe with strong coffee and wonderful crepes. Next door is a noodle shop with the most intoxicating aromas. Also, try dining at Le Bec Rouge a few blocks away.

The rooms and bathrooms have been re-done but the bedroom is so small the room is really just the bed with a narrow walkway out on each side. The bathroom is well appointed with a cute sliding door and oversize shower. The room is energy efficient and requires that you put in your hotel key card to activate the lights! The room was calm and the bed and linens were fine but this is not a place for anyone claustrophobic. Also, I think the floor below us allowed smoking in the rooms so the smell of smoke drifted up to our room. Our window faced into a small inner area so it was quiet but not much light. The location is close to the Musee d'Armee and the Eiffel Tower. There really isn't much in this part of town, so unlike other areas where you can leave your hotel and quickly find a bakery or cafe (many of them) there is only one cafe nearby and a bakery a couple of blocks down. You can walk to the heart of St. Germain (in about 15 minutes). The breakfast buffet, while convenient, was overpriced at 14 EURO and in particular, had an automatic coffee machine that made an instant version of coffee drinks that tasted awful, particularly in light of all the good coffee readily available in cafes! The breakfast room was also tiny and crowded. The desk staff, however, was very helpful and pleasant. There is an Internet kiosk in the lobby for guest use.

Before booking, we had a little hussle over the price of accommodation (being in hotel business myself I know how much bargaining room there usually is, so I never accept the rack rate), but we finally agreed on the price that seemed reasonable for us and got complimentary breakfast as well. As it was our first time in Paris, we booked a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel at arrival to make sure we ended up at the right place. However, next time we'll surely use the metro and advise others to do the same - the price difference is huge! We spent 3 nights at Aviatic and nothing bad can be said - the reception staff was polite and helpful and mostly spoke good English (with one exception), the rooms were of decent size, nicely decorated and clean. We especially liked all the little details - fresh flowers at the lobby, antique calendar on the front desk, unconventional temperature-regulating system in the shower, etc. The walls were a little thin, but as our room was facing the courtyard, no noise came in to disturb our good night sleep. Compared to what we encountered in the rest of France, breakfast at Aviatic was plentiful enough - good coffee, a decent selection of cheese, pastry, jam, and cereals. No hot dishes included in the price, unfortunately, but this was compensated by freshly squeesed orange juice, which gave a nice boost to start the day. The location is good if you don't mind walking a little (or if you do, there is always the subway), Les Invalides, the Eiffel tower and the Luxembourg gardens can surely be reached on foot. We also tried the Velib-bikes, which can be taken and returned all over the city. Cycle tracks are also almost everywhere, so you don't have to drive in the middle of the rest of the traffic. Only make sure that you leave the bike to the rental station whenever you are planning to walk around and not use it, otherwise it might become more expensive than expected.

Internet communications with staff at the hotel were very good. We were able to make last minute changes to our reservations without problems by communicating via e-mail. Had to cancel one night without 24 hours notice and were only charged the room tax for that night. They were very accommodating in terms of helping us find a solution for bedding for our 3 year old. I don't know if all the rooms are now renovated, but the Internet picture of the room that had 3 beds showed a very outdated room. Given that we like a modern, minimalist room we definitely wanted a renovated room. We got a room (room 236, on third floor, facing \"courtyard\") that had 1 king bed. They were able to turn a chaise lounge in the room into a little bed for our three year old. The staff was incredibly friendly and nice. Their English is superb and that includes staff on duty at night (Bruce). The room was excellent. Yes, small, but well equipped with an excellent use of space. Flat screen TV mounted on wall (we brought a portable DVD player that we were able to hook into the hotel's TV to watch movies). Electronic safe in the closet. Two nice white fluffy robes in the closet. Bed extremely comfortable with warm duvet. The lighting in the room was very modern. One part of the room had small halogen bulbs each hanging by two angular wires from tracks on the ceiling. There was a small honor bar which we didn't use. Bathroom was very small. It had a decent built-in blow-dryer. Nice fluffy, white, high-quality towels. We were given lots more towels by the front desk when we asked. Lots of hot water, never ran out. Nice deep shower/tub which was great for soaking in at the end of the day. One problem - the shower did leak all over the floor so by the end of a day there were at least 1 or 2 soaking wet towels that we just laid on the corner of the floor by the toilet. Our three year old really liked it. It was cozy and he was able to be close to us. The staff were extremely friendly to him even though he was the only child we saw in the hotel the entire time. He loved the unique elevators, pressing the elevator buttons, and the small spiral staircase in the back of the hotel leading to our room. Another thing our three year old liked was the refreshments the hotel staff put out one night in the lobby. It was simple \u2013 juice, fresh fruit, chilled water, etc. Our son was very thirsty after a long walk around the Left Bank and he had 3 glasses of juice - the hotel staff didn\u2019t bat an eye. We taught our son how to say simple things like \u201cBonjour Madame/Monsieur\u201d, \u201cMerci beaucoup\u201d, and \u201csil vous plait\u201d which I think helped. (As with any part of France, if you at least attempt the courtesy of greeting them in French, the people will be much more friendly and open than if you obnoxiously assume that they will just speak English.) One note: When we first arrived with all of our bags, both elevators were broken AND the stairwell leading to our room was being renovated. But the hotel staff handled it really well. The front desk guy had the workmen stop and he helped us carry our bags up three flights of stairs. The staircase renovation continued throughout our stay but was never loud. Also the workmen we saw were extremely nice. We never ate at the hotel. When you go straight out of the front door and turn left, there is a *great* caf\u00e9 on the corner, named something like the Marquise Caf\u00e9. Great little place, very friendly staff. (Don\u2019t miss the warm goat cheese salad!) The biggest drawback I found about this place was the location. Monparnasse seems kind of non-descript compared to the rest of Paris. I\u2019ve enjoyed the locations of the other places I\u2019ve stayed including the Latin Quarter, St. Germain de Pres, and the Opera area much better. Also, the Montparnasse train station is within walking distance to the hotel *if* you don\u2019t have bags. However I would not recommend getting off at Montparnasse station (either from Metro, RER, or Air France bus) and expect to walk easily with a child to the hotel. Invest in a cab. It cost us about 12 euros as we were also charged for each bag. But it was money well spent. In summary, this hotel can\u2019t be beat when it comes to friendliness. It was extremely child friendly and the room we stayed in was nicely decorated and updated. Biggest complaints were leaking shower and the blaise location in town. Unrelated to the hotel: Other things to do in Paris with a 3 year old\u2026 My husband took my son to the top of the Eiffel Tower which made a huge impression. He loved the elevator ride. Also at the base of the tower is a crepe stand and a carousel. He loved watching them make crepes and enjoyed eating them. He took two carousel rides and loved it. We had also planned to go to the Jardin d\u2019Acclimation and the Cite de la Science (sp?) but didn\u2019t have enough time as it was harder to overcome jet lag with our 3 year old. Right behind the Notre Dame cathedral is a delightful little park. It has a swing and an unusual thing we\u2019d never seen. It was a disk that was about 1-2 feet off the ground and at an angle. It was about 6 feet in diameter and about 3 kids (or 1 adult and 1 kid) can get on it and lay flat on the disk. If someone else spins, then you go round and round while looking through the shady trees up above. Also did ice cream at Berthellion on the Ile de Paris. He loved the Metro, especially when the live musicians would board and play music, looking for a few euros. The portable DVD player **really** helped on the plane to keep him quiet and focused. It worked for about 3 hours. We also brought his kiddy roll-a-board with lots of sticker and coloring books, etc.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAviatic lived up to all the great reviews, I am very pleased\u201d", "Author": "rwchicago", "ReviewID": "UR29495361", "Content": "My first trip to Paris was made even more enjoyable and memorable by my stay at the Aviatic St. Germain.

There are also a few fruit stands nearby where one could go for healthy snacks to balance out all the cheese and butter in the French diet.

Some of the other rooms seemed to have been modernised, and certainly the rooms on the upper floors (ie 3rd and above) won't be (as) affected by the floodlights, so I'd advise any travellers to bear this in mind when reserving.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cSuperb hotel!\u201d", "Author": "CecileNetherlands", "ReviewID": "UR27048216", "Content": "As we - my daughter and me - were looking for good value for money, we found this great hotel.

We stayed on a recommendation. There seems to be some confusion on this review forum as there are 2 Hotel Aviatics in Paris. The one I am reviewing is the one on rue Vaugirard in the Montparnasse area. We arrived a bit early (1130) and weren't able to go to out room until 1400. This was probably the ONLY complaint I could have - but even then they do point this out to you on the website (i.e.check in after 1400). In any case the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and we left our bags and explored the local area. I spoke to the staff in French and so cannot comment on how helpful they would be in I had used English. We returned at 1400 and went to our room. It was really nice and a decent size considering we only spent 100 euro for the night. It was also spotlessly clean and a pretty nice design. There was a new TV with plenty channels and the bed was very comfortable. Note the stairs are quite steep - would be difficult with lots of luggage or kids etc. We were on the 4th floor which was a bit of a hike. I didn't see a lift. The hotel decor is very nice..we didn't have breakfast as there are lots of places in the surrounding area. So all in all a really good experience - lovely hotel and fantastic reception staff.

The lobby is beautiful and the front desk people were very nice. We loved the night clerk, he was so helpful with getting our infant daughter to the childrens ER for a high fever (his names escapes me now). It is located right off the main street in Montparnasse in the 6th arrondisement. We walked to the corner cafe for breakfast every morning. We spent one day walking from our hotel to St. Sulpice then the Jardin du Luxembourg, then the Pantheon and finally Notre Dame and the Louvre. It took all day because we had a 5year old and an infant in the stroller but it was warm and sunny and we spent hours at the playground in the Luxembourg Gardens. The hotel was clean especially the bathrooms sparkled. The bedrooms were clean but could use an update ie bedspreads and carpet were worn looking. Myself and my husband and infant daughter stayed in one room for $179(superior) and my mom and 5 year old in the room across the hall for $149. One is just slightly bigger to fit a pack and play for the baby. The base of which was slightly weak and left the mattress unlevel. She ended up sleeping with us however, the King sized bed is two twins put together. She did not fall through, thank goodness. It was nice because we were the only people on that floor (two rooms to a floor in the back section of the hotel which is elevator accessible. I think the front of the hotel you need to take the stairs. Overall, we liked the hotel and would recommend it to our friends. Parking is directly across the street, you have to open a big gate and then drive down a narrow alley and then open up the manual garage door and try to squeeze your car (we had a European SUV, a VW Touran,a stick shift),into the tiny space. It was a challenge since we arrived at night. But nice that it was so close, we kept our car there for three days and walked and took the metro and buses to get around. We did walk halfway to the Eiffel tower down Montparnasse Blvd going west at night. It was beautiful to see the Eiffel Tower light up in blue light. Since I was wearing heels on my way to dinner, we took the Metro the rest of the way. I felt safe even at Midnight riding the metro with my husband (we are in our mid 30's). Beware, there are two hotels with very similar names. One is Aviatic Hotel (6th arrondisement, and 3 or 4 stars), the other is Hotel Aviatic (only one star, not nearly as nice) in the 14th arrondisement if I remember.
