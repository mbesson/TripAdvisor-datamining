Cigarettes on balcony never cleaned at non-smoking hotel and the room smelled like cigarette so we were asked to move rooms which happened the next day, which was nice of them. We were also told because of the trouble we would get \"free breakfast\" which was already included in the price we paid, then told would get free bottle of champagne (not for me because I don't drink much) but never got it. I never made a fuss of it, because I did not see a use and did not want to bother over such things. Not important,but just mentioning. If you go to this hotel I recommend taking Roissybus from Airport, about 10 min walk from where it drops you off. Room is VERY SMALL. Smallest I have ever been in,even compared to Japan, picture is abit deceptive and like previous reviewer mentioned to try asking for certain rooms numbers does not make a big difference, I had 3rd floor (room 315) and \"1st\", 3rd was bit bigger (nicer) but barely at all, again picture is deceptive. I now learned it is \"13 square meters / 140 square feet\" from what I now know, if you care about that. I knew it would be small but was a bit shocked. Also door would not properly close/lock on 3rd floor bathroom in the room,but this is not a big deal I guess. Location cannot be beat, very good. Breakfast was alright, nice pasteries. I would consider staying at hotel ampere next time as rooms are bit bigger, but location is not as central at all. Also, not that this is their fault BUT the room was very hot as it was unusually warm in March in the room (thanks to global warming?), and when called to ask how to turn on air conditioning, was told that there is none in March, this was not the best, and wish we could control it ourselves and found it uncomfortable to sleep at times even after putting the room to coldest it could go to for \"winter settings\". To sum it up, nicely decorated rooms but VERY SMALL and service could be a bit better and I wish you can use air conditioning if room is hot, window only helped a bit and noise outside not fun for night.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "princessNDJ", "ReviewID": "UR126534749", "Content": "Pretty close to the Louvre and within resonable walking distance to other attractions.

They also provide storage of bags after checkout, which was nice since our train didn't leave before 20pm. The receptionist was very helpful booking us a table at a lovely local restaurant, and the staff was overall extremely friendly. The negatives: I found the room a bit cold, but it shouldn't be a problem during normal temperatures (extreme cold periode in Europe now).

Having read the reviews I was not apprehensive about staying at the hotel as I knew what to expect and yet when I got there I was still overwhelmed at how fantastic it was. The hotel itself was lovely, good location but what made the hotel exceptional was the staff! I really havent stayed in a hotel like it for a while. The staff were friendly, effiecent and very courteous. We only saw three members of staff during our stay, a nice young lady, a young gentleman and an older man. All three members of staff where so helpful in offering directions, advice on the local area and where to eat even offering to assist in helping with tours. The hotel itself is a hidden gem, it is only small but very very clean, modern and central. It is near Pyramids metro station and just down the road from the Louvre (Opera metro - main line) so is a great place to stay with great links to all major attractions. Advice would be to buy your metro tickets in the airport Zone 1-5 (total for 3 days 44 EUR per person) using the metro is easy once you know all the lines and is the cheapest way as all the attractions are spread out. Go from the airport to Pyramids station, walk towards Barclays bank, when you get to Barclays turn right and then the first street on your left (after the push bike rack) is the hotel. - if you dont know where you are going and you get the metro it can be difficult to find. If you want a nice Itallian go to Trivolli or PastaPapa, both near the hottel.. Fab!

This trip was a romantic break with some sightseeing and we did not want to spend a fortune. Having been there before I knew that the Louvre area is the best place to stay as you are close to most of the attractions you want to see - walking distance in fact. The hoteliers also seem to know this as prices are very high. We found the Best Western Paris Louvre Opera on line and booked blind having read good reviews. They all seemed to be true. An outline of the stay: The hotel is nice, clean and well appointed. Rooms are small but all hotel rooms and elevators are small in Paris, even the really expensive ones in my experience. In this hotel each room has a flat screen TV, safe and a nice modern bathroom. Be aware that with period buildings with classical proportions the rooms get smaller as you get higher. We were initially booked into a room on the 4th floor, it was small and had a rather musty smell in the bathroom. I knew from the reviews that the hotel are keen to please so we didn't freak out and make a fuss but asked politely if we could move and we were, to a much bigger room on the first floor with windows that opened out on the street. It was lovely. Didn't have the breakfast as read it costs 11 euros and instead opted for Starbucks/Eiffel Tower breakfast which was fine. The reception staff were friendly, courteous and helpful (although they don't know everything so be prepared to figure out your own restaurant choices).

I am a middle aged grandmother, travelling alone, so had some specific requirements when looking for a place to stay. I do have to say that this hotel met all my requirements fabulously. The hotel is easy to find and on a quiet, yet well lit side street. My room actually faced the street, and though there was some street noise during the night (cars starting, etc.) it was surprisingly minimal. Being October, it got light late and dark early -- I never once felt uncomfortable walking around the area in the dark. Transportation around Paris is very easy from there. There is a metro stop literally around the corner with easy, line 7 connections to all the major sights and monuments. If you prefer to walk, the Louvre is about a 10 minute walk, the Orsay 10 minutes and Les Halles area is roughly 15 on foot. For department store shoppers, Galleries LaFayette is only 2 metro stops north, and The Forum at Les Halles is roughly 4 stops the other direction. For the serious (window) shopper the high society stores are 3 blocks to Rue Honore and go right about a mile down (where you can see actually steel toe shoes with 4 inch spike heels!) In the area are all the ammenities you will need -- a grocery store, the Tourist Bureau (museum passes and maps), a laundrymat, bakeries, wine and chocolate shops, cafes, several banks (ATM) -- even Starbucks! The hotel does offer breakfast but I didn't partake because of the options in the area. The room was typical Parisian cozy -- great for just me, but honestly, I would feel really cramped if I was travelling with someone I didn't didn't know well or didn't like very much. The bed was comfortable and the bathrom had a tub / shower combination and lots of counter space. The staff kept things very clean, very friendly and were extremely pleasant and helpful.

However, our room as well as the bathroom was so small. We had a tiny wardrobe closet that hardly could accommodate clothes for one, plus no where to put your luggage. Also our room was above the hotel entrance which had some street noise at times. When the female staff was working, we felt like we were on our own and shouldn't bother asking them any questions. The hotel area was off the Ave de Opera and is half way between the Louvre and the Opera House, so it was an easy walk either direction. Train station was only one block from he hotel and taxis were cheaper than what we expected. This hotel was priced above average, but the location was the only good thing I can say it. The one saving grace for our stay was the limo service they arranged to the airport, if it wasn't for a knowledgable driver who call ahead to check our flight, we could have been dropped off at the wrong terminal and missed our flight home. Next trip to Paris I would find any other hotel but this one. There was no value for the money. Also forget any hotel breakfast included at this price, croissants for 12 euros was beyond my budget.

Some people in our group paid a little more and got a slightly larger room (facing the street). The tinier rooms seemed to face the courtyard and were very quiet. -What I simply don't understand is people who book a hotel and don't do their research before arriving. So it was upsetting to see a person have a fit because his room was too small. He aggressively asked the receptionist for a larger room. Why didn't this guest read the hotel's reviews before booking?- Everyone in our group was delighted with our week-long stay at this hotel. The rooms were clean and recently renovated. The bathrooms were modern and tastefully appointed. We found the housekeeping and breakfast staff very nice. Most receptionists were also friendly and helpful, especially Thierry. I found the small breakfast buffet perfect. French pastries, bread, madeleines, biscottes, jam, butter, honey, Nutella, cr\u00eapes, scrambled eggs, yogurt, fresh fruit, hot drinks, juices, apple sauce, cereal, milk, etc, There was everything I needed. I heard some Americans complain because there were no made-to-order eggs and bacon or pancakes. Well: This is France! Try a French breakfast!!! :-) There is someone cleaning and serving the hot drinks, but the premises aren't really equipped to have someone cooking hot breakfasts as well. We all slept super well and found the mattresses very comfortable. Even the people whose rooms faced the front (the street) said it was quiet at night. Our favorite part was the hotel's location! You can walk everywhere from here! Walk one minute, and you are on Avenue de l\"Op\u00e9ra. Walk 5-10 minutes one way and you reach the Opera. Walk 5-10 minutes the other way, and you are at the Louvre. This location can't be beat! Walk 10 minutes in another direction, and you will be on place du March\u00e9 St Honor\u00e9, where you will find quite a few restaurants. On Ave de l'Op\u00e9ra, very close to the hotel, you will find a supermarket and department store (Monoprix), a p\u00e2tisserie (chez Paul), a Starbucks, and many boutiques. There are few restaurants on that street. However, the smaller streets surrounding the hotel are teeming with Japanese restaurants (all price ranges).

Best Westerns in Europe are usually in a higher category than those in the U.S., so that would have worked for this hotel. Anyway, the best thing about this hotel is its location and quiet ambiente, tucked away as it is in a tiny side street just off the Boulevard d'Opera. Both the Louvre and the Opera are a short walk away. Tuilleries Gardens are closeby. You can walk to the Musee d'Orsay and even to Notre Dame, if you like to walk. Wow! The room for two was TINY, so was the bed. The latter may have been smaller than full size! You couldn't open a suitcase on the sides of the bed. Only one person was able to use the shelves and storage in the room. But we made it work. Our windows were facing the center courtyard, so it was really quiet at night. I had free Internet access, which was great as I had to finish off a job I had to complete by a deadline. The employees were all very friendly and helpful. I asked for a printout of a page and it was brought to my room after I had scanned and e-mailed the page to the hotel staff. The area is rife with Japanese fare, but understand that like everything in Paris, even the small restaurants and holes in a wall are EXPENSIVE.

The hotel was chosen , as it was close to several metro stations, close to many attractions and close to the major shopping areas (mights as well combine pleasure and work whenever possible). The hotel is like many other, older Paris hotels. The rooms are small, and the rooms are not intended for two people with large suitcases or as a place to unwind before burning the midnight oil in front of the laptop. The rooms are exactly what they are ment for - a place to crash when exhausted by sightseeing and worn down by walking the streets of Paris. The room was clean, well functioning and with a good quality bed - I slept like a log all nights there. The bathroom was also clean and functional - but excessive space is not a word in the vocabulary here. Every square meter is used. Breakfast is not included - if time is not a problem try some of the good caf\u00e9's in the area - but for a quick bite before work, it's fine. WiFi is free, but beware that the WiFi turns to WireFi in most of the rooms - WiFi works best in the lobby. So bring your own cable or borrow one in the reception - then it works perfectly - provided you get the username and password in the reception - these changes on a regular basis. The staff is very attentive and helpful and apologised that the interned connection went down 1 am one night - it was up and running the following morning so my mails could be sent. There is a safe - this does not accommodate a laptop - but since i didn't bother to log it along to an exhibition and conference I left it there - no problem at all. The location is quiet - and the narrow street does not encourage heavy traffic - and definitely not any parking! All in all it was a fine hotel, taken price and location into consideration - and I can recommended for both business and leisure.

I saw both and opted for the back room for quietness. The cleanliness I rated a 3 as I saw a pubic hair on the bathroom floor, was repulsed and immediately thought of the tv show Hotel Inspector and the carpet smelled. There was one tiny guest soap for each guest so had to use the same soap to wash my face and for my bath. Other amenities include bath gel and shampoo bottles. The breakfast was pricey. I was told 12 euros for continental breakfast upon arrival. Suggest go to Starbucks on Avenue de l'Opera just round the corner. Sleep quality I rated a 2 as the thermostat ranged from 16 to 18 yet at night the room was sweltering hot. One night we opened the window all night but then it became freezing cold so I woke early freezing. The next night we opened the window to cool the room and then closed and repeated this. So no win situation. As for the free wifi, it was only accessible in the lobby and not in the rooms, so I was given a user number and password for access and would trek down to the lobby with my laptop to access the internet. The hotel does not provide any computers so bring your laptop. We got a special price from Best Western for early booking, else in my opinion it would not be worth the regular nightly rate of 200 euros. There is a small safe in the room but not big enough for a laptop. I would suggest you carry your valuables everywhere as I did and do not leave at this hotel.

I knew it was going to be difficult to get something decent without paying ridiculous amounts. Our 1st 3 choices were taken, and Paris Louvre Opera seemed to fit our requirements - clean, recently renovated, near location. Located on a very narrow street off Avenue Opera, disembarking with luggage on a busy day was not easy. Hotel lobby was small but everything was tastefully decorated. 1st room they gave us had the bath as we requested, but it was TINY (smaller than HK hotels) and right outside the elavator, which I specifically requested to be away from. After a quick moan, they changed us to a room at the back. Room was bigger but no bathtub. We took it. My wife is always a good gauge about the comfort level of the room and she slept very badly throughout our stay. Not much natural light, dinghy, bed was not very comfortable. Shower doors were badly sealed so every night there were huge puddles on the floor. Always had to ask before they gave extra towels to mop up the floor. As the hotel did not provide free slippers, it was unpleasant having to walk around with a wet bathroom floor. The worst was the fact the cleaning lady hoovered the sheets instead of changing them, we noticed the sheets appeared clean but had the same water stain for 2.5 days. The management changed the sheets after another complaint. All in all Iwe did not like the hotel and will not be returning. On the positive side the location is brilliant, the price reasonable so try and secure one of the better rooms if you do decide to stay.", "Date": "March 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porto", "Title": "\u201cWe ain't comming back.\u201d", "Author": "pmfigueira", "ReviewID": "UR6821638", "Content": "Our expirience at this hotel wasn't very pleased (4 night's) First we couldn't sleep the first night at the hotel because the room had \"some problems\".

About the hotel: The hotel is very central and has a metro station nearby. The room was very small and had a terrible insonorization. It had no exterior window as i had asked. The lobby lacks a computer for internet acess (dispite having wireless). Dispite all this Paris is gordious.
