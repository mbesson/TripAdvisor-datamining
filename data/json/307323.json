{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Pleasant stay in Old Style Asakusa I really enjoyed our stay in Asakusa. It was a bit like staying in the suburbs rather than Any City Japan. The metro was a 10 min walk (2 stations in different locations) but the Tsukuba Express is 2 mins away and links to Akihabara. The entertainment area is across the road but does not intrude or make one feel unsafe. The restaurants in the area all seemed to stay open quite late which was welcome. Our room was huge and had a great view of the temple and fair ground. I feel sorry for the previous reviewer because we had no problem with noise, air conditioning or uncleanliness. We had a drink in the bar which was fine but expensive and smoky - this seemed to be the norm for all hotel bars. Breakfast was reasonable with some excellent fresh apple juice. I would recommend.", "Date": "Nov 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR616180925", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Blackcat2"}, {"Content": "Save yourselves from this wretched hotel!!! Me and my husband booked this hotel for Hotelclub website for 4 nights for 180$ a night not including breakfast. This was the second most expensive hotel in Japan (out of 5 hotels in 3 weeks) but by far the worst. There were hairs in the sink, on the bed, in the tub, something smeared in the toilet, dust and tangled electric wires by the bed. The worst thing was the screeching loud noises made from the in-wall piping - we couldn't get sleep. The air conditioning didn't work (apparently there were two switches in two different places in the room. How are we supposed to know?) Plus it was a smoking room, although we asked for a non smoking one (so it stank too). They could only transfer us to a twin room so we left , paying a fine of 180$ and spending half a day on moving to a different hotel. It was a nightmare. BTW - crappy location - whore houses, noise, no train close to the hotel (- there's only this one temple in walking distance. All in all - save your selves from this wretched place!!!", "Date": "Oct 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR419596163", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Meirav1981"}, {"Content": "Wonderful service, great view, nice room I knew I wanted to stay in this area of Tokyo, because of proximity to the Asakusa Kannon Temple, the old style Japanese feeling of the area and the shopping area at the temple. This hotel exceeded expectations because the room was much larger than expected. There was a sitting area and a floor to ceiling window. The western style bathroom was large for a Japanese hotel room and had a bidette. The bed was hard, but comfortable. There was a cigarette odor when we entered (there are no 'no smoking' rooms) but the bell girl immediately brought a deoderizing spray that (amazingly) worked. Just one example of the very accomodating staff.The halls were wide and well appointed--nice carpeting and wallpaper.The check-in staff was outstanding. They wrote out directions to attractions, helped with pronounciation, spoke good English, helped with learning some Japanese, even walked outside to show the direction if we appeared bewildered.We did not eat at the restaurant. It was too expensive for us, but the food looked good and it was full most of the time we were there.The hotel does accept tours, but it is difficult for buses to get into the turn. The hotel appeared to be very popular for weddings; we saw at least three separate events during our three day stay. Although the hotel was nearly full, it was very quiet. There were a lot of families with children, couples, seniors.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR634971620", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "princessLA"}, {"Content": "Luxury Hotel in Akasaka * A luxury hotel in quite a down-to-earth area\u9225?Staff are very helpful and welcoming\u9225?Decor is opulent yet slightly old-fashioned\u9225?Double room was huge with a fantastic view\u9225?Japanese restaurants inside were very tasty and a great experience", "Date": "Jan 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR491934127", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "innit76"}, {"Content": "Overnight Narita to Asakusa We needed to stay overnight between flights arriving and departing Narita. Deciding to avoid airport hotels, we chose the Asakusa View as being reasonably accessible from Narita (take the Skyliner to Ueno and a short taxi ride). We arrived at about 4.00 pm and departed at 7.30 the following morning. The hotel itself was adequate for a short stay, although the carpets were a bit grubby and the room was very basic. The staff were very helpful. However, the real plus was the short walk from the hotel to the temple, pagoda and wonderful pedestrian streets lined with shops and restaurants - a memorable evening before returning to Narita.

We arrived at the Asakusa View Hotel after 16 hours travelling and were delighted to find it even better than described in the other reviews here. As you come in through the door \u9225?helped by uniformed porters and doormen \u9225?the Mimosa caf\u8305 is directly in front of you. Our room wasn\u9225\u6a9b ready when we arrived (around 12:00) so we enjoyed a relaxing coffee there before going up to the room on the 20th floor. There are 6 good-sized quick lifts and we never needed to wait long for one to arrive. To the left of the caf\u8305 (which is fronted by a French-themed patisserie counter \u9225?you have to try the green cake for a real fusion of French and Japanese tastes!) is the small hotel shop and a couple of internet terminals. Immediately to the right of the caf\u8305 don\u9225\u6a9b miss the portable shrine. Further to the right of the lobby are the Reception and Information desks. Throughout our 6-day stay we enjoyed friendly and courteous service from all the hotel staff.We weren\u9225\u6a9b on the recommended west side of the hotel but still enjoyed good views eastwards across to Shinjuku through the floor-to-ceiling bay window. Look out for the giant \u9225\u6973aneki Neko\u9225?(waving cat) sculpture on one of the nearby buildings. The room was a smoking room (the hotel isn\u9225\u6a9b 100% non-smoking by any means) and good size by any standards, with a queen size bed. Wardrobe space was a little tight but there\u9225\u6a9a a chest of drawers too and plenty of floor space for cases. In addition there\u9225\u6a9a a narrow console table, a desk, and a small table with 2 armchairs in the window bay. The bathroom was fine, not palatial but no smaller than in most London hotels. The slippers are in the wardrobe and traditional yukata robes in the chest of drawers. If you\u9225\u6a99e a fan of baths rather than showers you may find the bath small. As other have mentioned the TV may have plenty of channels but unless you speak Japanese you\u9225\u6a92l be restricted in your viewing to CNN and one of the Japanese stations that shows a daily English-language film.However, you\u9225\u6a87 need to be crazy to want to sit around watching TV with Asakusa on your doorstep. This is a fascinating low-rise part of Tokyo, criss-crossed by streets packed with small specialist shops and restaurants. You can get to the Senso-ji temple in 5 minutes; all around the temple you\u9225\u6a92l find specialists dealing in fabrics, kimonos, fans, umbrellas \u9225?you name it, there\u9225\u6a9a probably a shop specialising in it. Further south near the Tawaramachi subway station [Ginza line] you\u9225\u6a92l find shops selling religious goods (e.g. Buddhist and Shinto household shrines) and you\u9225\u6a99e near the Kappabashi \u9225\u6ddcitchen City\u9225?as well. The Post Office (where the ATMs accept foreign bank cards) is right beside Tawaramachi subway stationIf you walk 5 minutes further west from Senso-ji you\u9225\u6a92l find the Asakusa station [Tobu line] for trains to the opulent historic shrines at Nikko (c. 2 hours). Further south along the riverbank is the Asakusa waterbus terminal for river ferries \u9225?we went to the first stop at the lovely Hama Rikyu gardens but you can continue all the way to the harbour. And the river bus terminal is very near the Asakusa subway station [Asakusa line] where Asakusa-Dori meets the river Sumida. (BTW the multiplicity of stations called \u9225\u6962sakusa\u9225?is confusing \u9225?sadly the one nearest the hotel is the least useful, being almost the end of the Tsukuba suburban rail line; the Asakusa subway station [Ginza line] is not too far from the Kaminari-mon or Thunder Gate of the temple).Back to the hotel: there are 5 restaurants\u9225?French and Chinese on the top floors, two Japanese on the 6th floor, and the Caf\u8305 de Kapiten on the ground floor. We tried the sushi restaurant on the 6th and the de Kapiten on our first and last nights, respectively. Both were fine \u9225?the de Kapiten is less atmospheric and cheaper. I would say however that you will eat as well or better for less outside the hotel. You\u9225\u6a99e spoilt for choice \u9225?we enjoyed the Korean (barbecue) \u9225\u696con Jin\u9225?across the road and the sushi restaurant only yards away on the same side of the road (just go out, turn right and it\u9225\u6a9a less than a minute away). Minibar prices are expensive but the hotel shop is not, or for a wider selection of non-alcoholic drinks there\u9225\u6a9a a streetside vending machine near the sushi place I mentioned above.My partner is disabled and walks with the help of a stick or 3-wheeler walking aid. The Asakusa View presented no problems whatsoever \u9225?probably the easiest hotel we\u9225\u6a9de ever stayed in. And the surrounding area was also a blessing, with many interesting sights only moments from the hotel for those days when we didn\u9225\u6a9b feel like being energetic.As a final tip, if arriving with Narita with heavy bags, go to the luggage delivery service counters on the ground floor and for a reasonable price they will take your bags and deliver them to your hotel. We dropped 2 cases off at 11:00 for re-delivery between 16:00 and 20:00 at a cost of c. \u62e215 ($30). This made the trip by Keizei train to Ueno station very easy indeed (trains accessible from ground floor of airport); the taxi from Ueno to the hotel cost maybe \u62e28 ($16) or you can get the subway 2 stops to Tawaramachi [Ginza line] and walk up Nishiasakusa to the hotel. Returning to the airport you need to send your bags the day before if using the luggage delivery service; the hotel can arrange this.", "Date": "Oct 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR896742405", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Gebwart"}, {"Content": "Adequate Whilst I would agree that the staff are friendly, I would stress that, in our experience, they are no more so than in rest of Japan.

Stayed 4 nights at the Asakusa View Hotel at the beginning of May on my first trip to Tokyo. Having booked through Expedia and benefiting from an excellent price I was expecting a standard 3 star hotel.But as my taxi pulled up I was pleasantly surprised, as I was met by a smart hotel porter and ushered into a gleaming and spotless reception hall. First impressions do count and the welcome and courtesy showed by the porter and reception staff were gratefully welcomed after a long flight from London.Throughout my stay I can not fault any staff member how were so polite and professional throughout, especially the reception manager who was especially helpful. All the staff speak English which was a relief as my Japanese consists of 4 words.Room on the 11th floor, spotless if a little tired but great view out onto the Senso Ji Temple and beyond. Bed very comfortable, bathroom small but manageable with a heated toilet seat and double action bidet. Only gripe was the only English language channel TV in room was the dreadful CNN.Ate once in the hotel at the Cafe de Kapiten which was pleasant, good service but meal nothing special. Lots of good restaurants and bars around on the other side of the road in front of the hotel. Very safe and colourful area. Hotel has a supermarket next door and a few minutes down the street a 7-11, and a Rox department store with basement foodhall. Ideal for stocking up with goodies and could purchase a breakfast consisting of a drink, cake and sandwich all for less of the price of a fruit juice on the hotel menu. Nice cake shop in the hotel lobby, little cafe behind expensive (\u62e25 for a cup of coffee) other shops in the hotels shopping centre naff. Most guests here at the hotel seem to be Japanese or from mainland Asia, I think I was the only European which was refreshing.Caught the Keisei Skyliner from Narita Airport to Ueno Station on arrival and then a taxi to the hotel (about \u62e210) Going back if your not weighed down with luggage then I would recommend the 10 minute walk down to Tawaramachi Station and take the subway to Ueno Station ( about 70p)", "Date": "May 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR423099488", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Durhamguy"}, {"Content": "So much fancier than expected for price Thought we had picked a medium size, medium priced hotel.

The rooms feature beautiful picture windows with great views. Both of the rooms we had were clean and quite spacious (which surprised us as we had heard that hotel rooms in Tokyo are small). Both rooms also had large (king?) beds, desks, sitting areas, vanity areas, and generously-sized bathrooms.
