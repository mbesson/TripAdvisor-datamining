Also there was no display of attraction leaflets, like most hotels have. Second, the bed was fantastic but apart from that the room was no great: no minibar, no coffee making facilities etc. Third, to go to the fitness room, you had to walk through part of the bar!

That's okay when you aren't in the room. However, you don't move enough while sleeping to keep the AC on, so we woke up a couple of times incredibly hot and had to get up and walk around the room to get the AC to kick back on. Sleep quality would've been and \"Excellent\" if it wasn't for this AC issue. - The Master Power switch was off when we first entered the room, so we were a bit confused as to why the bathroom lights wouldn't switch on, until we saw the \"Master\" label on one of the switches. This was generally fine, but that complimentary water was warm because the fridge was not on. - I knew this before-hand, but was still disappointed that there was no coffee maker in the room - The room was a bit smaller than expected, but was understandable considering we are in the city and we were in a regular queen-bed room.

Loads of great restaurants nearby and the Prudential centre for shopping. Never used any of their other facilities, but staff were always courteous to us whenever we walked past.

We were assigned room 820 and when we walked in, I was a bit disappointed but just figured the rooms are smaller at this hotel especially it being a police station at one time. We met my brother prior to going to dinner and when I walked into his room, my mouth dropped. It was a nice spacious room with a huge bathroom. He was assigned room 238. He actually reserved a superior room but as it turned out, he received an upgrade. I did inquire at the desk and they did offer to change our room, but at that point we were settled in and heading off to dinner. I guess I would just be aware that not all the Delxue rooms are the same so when you do check in, make sure you receive what you think you are getting. We did up going to the bar later that night and it was fun. Great drinks! We had breakfast at the Stanhope Grille the next day as it was included in on the AAA package but it only included the buffet. I was fine with it but my husband would have preferred to order off the menu. He is a pancake lover and was not impressed with the pancakes at the buffet. Construction at this hotel was a problem.

We walked to the Citi performance Center which is also a nice walk away. Hightly recommend the Rockettes Christmas Show. It was excellent. We also parked at the garage at 100 Claredon which again is only a block away from the hotel. Look online for a coupon to park overnight for $19.00. Not sure what it would have been otherwise.

The Back Bay Hotel we found to be a fantastic all round hotel & base. We had a Kingsize deluxe I believe, great comfy bed, nexpresso machine, fridge, bottled water daily etc. Large bathroom inc bath, robe, quality towels in fact everything exceeded our expectations in every way. Every night with our weary feet we returned to classical music, dimmed lights and chocolates on the bed.. luxury :-) as part of their turn down service. Celebrating out 25th wedding anniversary on the arriving Monday we had bubbly on ice and hand made chocs awaiting us with a personilsed accompanying card (on the house I may add :-)... which was a wonderful touch. Staff were happy, attentive and eager to assist... many thanks to all the staff who made our stay so great. The area we found was ideal to explore as so central, 2 blocks up was Newbury St, which is a great walk leading down to the Prudential Building and Copley Mall etc, a few blocks away also is Boston Common etc.& easy to navigate to and from as next to the John Hancock bulding. The hotel bar \"Cuffs\" was appealing as again staff great, nice warm fire and always had residents or even passers by in, the beer (local lagers/beers etc) slightly more expensive than the street bars but acceptable. We are great explorers so did not actually eat there but scanned tripadvisor for \"interesting\" haunts to try, I can recommend the Paramount on charles st for an authentic Boston breakfast exerience, Mikes Pastries up on Hanover (Little Italy, for a carry out box of treats yum yum!) The thinking cup overlooking the top of the common for a relaxed and great coffee. We also tried Atlantic Fish Co.. superb fresh fish and slightly up market but then you get what you pay for :-) Even the food courts were good if on budget :-) For a real Boston feel and an economical meal try the pour house just past the prudential, great burgers, wraps and beer ooooo and more beers. (May look scary from the outside - but go in live a little) The back Bay hotel we found to have an excellent blend of european design and feel with great american service and would recommend this to anyone looking for somewhere to visit Boston who appreciates location, quality surroundings of both staff and the hotel as a whole. Boston itself was beautiful this time of year, not so fast and in your face as NYC, lower skyline meaning more light to the streets, all areas walkable, great shopping, it has a great culture and history, and the people much more friendly and a sense of humour :-) We hope to return - many thanks and well done Back Bay :-)", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice facility\u201d", "Author": "Lambert B", "ReviewID": "UR121049419", "Content": "Managed to get a good rate for a weekend in Boston.

The good news is the hotel is very lovely and in a wonderful location, close to everything! I was traveling with my young daughter and we loved the convenience to all the shopping and restaurants. Room service was excellent and the food outstanding...the BEST coffee! The not so good news...I know from past experience at hotels that the late bird gets the left overs. We checked in at around 9:30 pm. and when we arrived at our room we noticed the door was ajar. I first thought they'd given us a room that was already occupied but we found it empty and clean so we went in and unpacked. The room was very lovely but there was a very damp/wet/sticky feeling in the air, like the humidity level was very high. I turned on the Air Conditioner to try to get the dampness out of the air, then left for a late dinner. Upon our return I notice the room still felt damp and that the A/C was not cooling. Then, when I finally took off my shoes and walked on the carpet, my socks were instantly wet! The carpet was completely wet....It appeared they shampooed it that day but obviously it was not going to dry quickly in that damp room without decent air circulating. I called down to the hotel desk and spoke to Chris or Craig? who informed me the carpets had been cleaned that day then apologized and offered to send up some slippers. I told him about the non-working A/C and he said it was too cold outside for the A/C to work? It was about 50 degrees outside that evening...balmy for Boston standards...he suggested I open the window.... Then, when I walked into the bathroom I noticed the toiletries consisted of only 2 bars of soap, no lotions, shampoo, or conditioner. I called Chris/Craig again and asked for the items to be sent up. If my daugher and I hadn't been so tired and already unpacked, I would have asked to switch rooms because of the wet carpet, but even though I didn't ask, it would have been nice for the hotel to offer. My guess is another guest had been given that room earlier in the day, they refused to stay on wet carpet and were moved but decided to pilfer the toiletries out of the bathroom before they left. We did try to sleep with the window open that night, until I couldn't stand the outside noise any longer....the sirens of police cars seemed to be constant. Slowly through the weekend the carpet dried...I turn on the heater when we were gone to help. It was still damp between the 2 beds even after 3 days.

Great Clam Chowder. I must say how nice Greg (I think that was his name) in the restaurant was. Really helpful, friendly and genuinely interested in making your evening/stay as good as possible.

The hotel is in the old police headquarters which is pretty cool history. The room was a good size with very nice bedding. The bathroom was one of the best parts. It was large and included a large walk-in shower with towel warmer (though the towel warmer was across the bathroom from the shower which didn't make much sense), two large spa-like terry-cloth robes, generous complimentary spa-type toiletries, and a large 'close-up' mirror for applying make-up, etc. (in addition to a regular mirror, of course) Also in the room was a large flat screen TV, refrigerator (w/2 complimentary bottles of water inside), the latest 'Boston' magazine and some nice guides to the area. The front desk staff was very helpful and very pleasant. (Though the doorman didn't say hi or welcome me once.) The front desk staff were more than happy to let us leave our bags in their holding area near the front desk since my flight wasn't until 5pm on Sunday. Note, the little coffee/barista on the first floor (you must pay for coffee) is NOT open on Sunday mornings. (But there are many coffee shops you can walk to.) Breakfast is NOT included but there is a restaurant in the lower level of the hotel. We did not eat there so I don't know if it is good or not. The restaurant across the street seemed popular in the evening so I imagine it must be pretty decent, however we did not eat there. The location of the hotel was in the nice Backbay area with lots of shopping and restaurants within an easy walk. To get here from the airport was pretty easy, however you do have to take two different 'T' trains (switch once) to get there and then walk about 2-3 blocks. (Though I imagine most people that stay here would pay to take a cab from their airport which is about a 20 min cab ride I believe.)

We took taxi several occations and it took much longer than train and charged us more than usual, so it is better to use train. Also, Boston is very easy to walk. We walked most of the sights include, freedom train starting point (10min), duck tour departure point(5min), Cheers restaurant at Becon Hill(10min), Faneuil Hall Market Place (20min) etc. Copley Square is just around corner and plenty of restaurants, cafe, shops are near by.

Hotel Room Con: No coffee maker in the room, Not good view, Heat/Air Conditioning does not walk well and our room gets very dry(tend to get very warm but you can open small window). Complaints: *This hotel advertise as umbrella provided in the room for complimentary use but there wasn't any in our room. We asked several times but no umbrella available, so we end up purchasing one on our own. *3adults registered and stayed in the room but house keeping only set the room for 2 adults every time they clean our room. We kept reminded both guest service and house keeping but they seems cannot set room for 3 adults, so we have to ask every day to bring up another bottled water and towels. *We requested and made special note at the time of booking but they seems not reading it or ignored. (maybe we booked from hotels.com?) Nothing special for anniversary celebration or birthday. Notes: Our room was by the elevator and across from the construction site. However, we didn't hear much noise and it was fairly quiet considering in the city. Hotel Service Pro: Lovely and very helpful concierge Heather! She is very friendly and informative. Also, we didn't catch the name but another concierge who work in the evening was very helful as well. Both of them went extra mile to help us. Great Job for both of you & Big Thank You!

Just a short walk to Boylston and Newbury Streets. In fact, the majority of Boston can be reached in a very short space of time. I considered staying at the Omni but am now pleased that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as the Back Bay is, in my opinion, in a better location. Transfer from Logan was easy and took less than 30 minutes. Courtesy bus to the Airport T station, Blue Line to Government Centre and Green Line to Arlington. It was then a short walk to the hotel. A great welcome at the reception desk and fast check in. My room was great. Absolutely no problem at all with size. A huge, comfortable bed, complimentary bottled water in the fridge each day, bathrobes and a great walk in shower. I requested a quiet room and it certainly was. It was absolutely no fault at all of the hotel but on the first night the guy in the room next door was trying to get Olympic Gold Medal in the door slamming event. He seemed incapable of closing his door quietly. What is the matter with these people? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they have any consideration at all? Luckily he moved on after one night hopefully to take a shower at the Bates Motel. I put the pictures and light fittings back on the wall and it was completely tranquil after he had gone! The complimentary Wi Fi was fine. Speed was fast enough for most things and easy to connect either as wired or wireless. Large flat screen TV and also a mini Hi Fi system for playing CD's and the radio. Lots of storage space for clothes. I only had breakfast in the Stanhope Grill on three days. At $23.00 I felt the buffet was a bit pricey as I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat a lot for breakfast. Coffee and toast is all I need. There are several fast food places round Copley Square and, once I had found them, I went to them instead. I used Cuffs Irish Bar a couple of nights. The beer, food and service were fine and prices were OK. It was busy on some nights so I chose to go elsewhere as I wanted a quiet drink. It seemed to attract the after work crowd and was quieter later on in the evening. Overall I cannot think of anything adverse to say about the Back Bay. As far as I am concerned it ticks all the boxes. Great location, rooms and staff.

This visit again was great, and even better than the first time around. We stayed for three nights over Labor Day Weekend. The hotel is located in the great Back Bay area of the city. You are so close to so many great restaurants, Boston Public Garden, the start of the Freedom Trail, Charles River, Beacon Hill and so much more. We arrived late on a Friday evening and were checked in by a friendly person at the front desk. The hotel is as I remember it; however, the front lobby is decorated beautifully and better than before. I got to admit though, it was disappointing to see the water wall at the entrance not working at all during our weekend. (Of course, that didn't sour my view of the hotel). We had a deluxe standard room on the 2nd level of the hotel. You do not stay at the Back Bay Hotel for the views, as most rooms face an internal roof or the street/alley as did ours. However, the room was beautifully decorated! It had subtle tones and the decor was casual-elegant. The amenities in the room were great. These included robes, slippers, Napresso machines, great LCD TV with a wide selection of channels, a super comfortable bed, refrigerator, plenty of outlets, a great working A/C Unit, complimentary bottled water and so much more. The bathroom was great with elegant lighting including under vanity lighting when you approached the bathroom, heated towel racks, great water pressure and more. We were also very pleased with the housekeeping and the nightly turndown service. The property has a really nice workout facility/room for a mid-sized property. There is a bar on property, which we did not utilize; however, we did have breakfast all three mornings in the Stanhope Grill, the on-site restaurant. The breakfast buffet was excellent and including yogurt, cereal, fruit, cold meats, pastries, scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, potatoes, bacon, sausage, pancakes. You could also order omelettes and waffles at no extra cost. The cost of the buffet also included juice and coffee/tea. Some people say it is expensive; however, I would say it is on par for a in-hotel restaurant in that area of the city. One final thought, for those who complain of noise. Boston is an urban area. You will have some noise. The noise was not bad and we were on the second floor. For those that complain of the noise, try a suburb.

We arrived at about 6.30pm, having caught a cab from Logan airport (driven by the most grumpy driver I've ever come across). If I recall, it cost about $35 - a toll or airport charge gets added to the meter fare, which confused me when I got much less change than expected. The lady at check-in was very friendly and helpful. She provided us with a local map and explained what facilities were available at the hotel. We were pretty tired, so most of it didn't really go in, but the map proved very useful later in our stay. Our room was on the 2nd floor, with a view of a back street, so nothing really to write home about. I half considered asking to change it, but I figured we weren't really going to be spending much time in the room. The room itself seemed a bit small (a superior king), but it was perfectly fine. It was very tastefully decorated and clean. The shower was very good and the bed very comfortable. It was a bit noisy early in the morning, but then we were in a central area in a bustling city, so I guess it's to be expected. We didn't really experience much else the hotel had to offer, aside from room service on the first night, as we ate all our meals out, and were too tired after long days to sit in the bar at the end of the day. The room service was very quick, and actually pretty good. I wasn't hungry, but the wife had beer battered cod and chips and a soft drink. Including tip, delivery charge etc, it cost $28 - pretty pricey, but I've had really bad meals that have cost more, so it didn't feel like too much of a rip-off. All the staff were very polite, and said hello when we were coming and going. Only one slight irritation, and that was when we were leaving to get a cab to collect our hire car. The door man asked if we needed help with our bags. I said we were fine, and started to head to the line of waiting cabs. He then asked if we needed a cab, and having said we were going to grab the cab I could see waiting, he then insisted on taking my case and putting it in the trunk/boot of the cab. I obviously then had to tip the guy, when I felt I was quite capable of walking a few meters to the line! Only a minor grumble really. Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it. We really appreciated having a fridge in the room, as opposed to a minibar, to store drinks in. Complementary bottles of water was a nice touch. The location is pretty good, as most of the areas the average tourist would want to visit are in easy walking distance. We booked using hotels.com, and took advantage of their price match promise, ending up with a refund of just under \u00c2\u00a3100. Make sure you take a screen shot if you find a cheaper price after booking. Also, we used quidco, a cashback site, that had a 12% offer with hotels.com. So the \u00c2\u00a3620 we paid when we booked (for 3 nights), ended up being \u00c2\u00a3445 after the cashback and the price match refund, which I thought was a great deal for a hotel of this standard.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat service\u201d", "Author": "salf0rdian", "ReviewID": "UR118054044", "Content": "On arrival the reception staff were more than helpful and that was indicative of all staff during our stay and especially Heather(think thats her name)the concierge, very knowledgeable with regards getting about on the T, where to eat breakfast(thanks for letting us know about Billy's & Charlies's)and sightseeing.

We only use the T to get around Boston when we visit, so this hotel was ok, not greatly located to a T. There were two stations about equal distance from the hotel. You could also get to the Copley Square shopping area and Newberry street with the high end shops. We ended up getting this hotel for a great last minute price on priceline, as we arrived early morning into Boston without any reservations for a last second birthday getaway. When we arrived to the hotel at 9am we were given a room with a queen bed, told that we could wait for a room with a king, but since we just had 5 hours of rest we wanted to get into a room for a nap. Since we booked on priceline, we, as usual, got the smallest possible room in the place, but that doesn't bother me, we don't go to Boston for a hotel room. The Room: was tiny and facing another building on a low floor. I wouldn't want to pay rack rate for this room, but since all we wanted was a bed for the night, it was fine. The bathroom was acceptable, there was plenty of furniture in the room, a small closet (with an umbrella in it for you to use on rainy days, which it was). The bed was very comfortable, it is a bit on the soft side, so if you prefer a harder bed you might want to go elsewhere. Now the issue that was a big concern to us, but was taken care of very well by the manager. When we arrived I noticed blood spots on a pillowcase. I thought it was odd and asked if someone could come change it while we went off to breakfast. They did. I didn't think of looking at the rest of the sheets. Upon our return later that evening, getting ready for bed I thought a more thorough look at the bedding was in order. There were blood spots on the other pillows and the sheets. Not the kind of spots like from a bed bug, but from someone being cut and leaving a trail. At that point we called down to ask to be moved because blood that isn't yours is just not a good thing to be laying around in. Maybe the maids finger was cut and she didn't know it as she made up the room. A minute after our call the manager on duty, Miss Nuala Creedon, called to apologize and say that we would be moved if we wanted to gather our things, that she and a bellhop would be up to help us move. We expected a room of the same size/location, what we got was a great night in the Presidential Suite. WOW. Beyond amazing. I've had small complaints at other hotels, but have never been upgraded like that. I doubt that was the only room available in the hotel, they didn't even know it was my birthday, and the staff made it clear that we were important to them. Thanks. As for others who have noted the noise in their rooms. Yes, both rooms we had were a bit noisy, but the hotel is in the middle large city, with tons of traffic, and yes, a fire station in view. Can't blame the hotel, I've stayed other places in Boston, it is always noisy. Our 10th floor room was just as noisy as the 3rd floor room. Best part about this hotel. Its a 4 star hotel with free wifi in your room, amazing, that never happens. It wasn't even hidden in some \"resort\" fee. Top notch in my book. We didn't use any of the other features of the hotel so I can't comment on the restaurant or workout room. As for parking, what are you doing driving in Boston, even the natives don't drive. A one day car rental is the same price as parking overnight, so just rent for one day from the airport like we did, you can drop the car off anytime. To me, the difference between a 4 and a 5 star rated hotel on tripadvisor is the service you get. And for The Back Bay Hotel, they are definately top notch in that department.

Natalie explained that the 9th floor has some Wi Fi problems so she had us moved to another floor and all was fine after that.

All the hotel staff; front counter, bellhops, and bar staff were very friendly and quick to offer help. Just one note on something not related to the hotel - Boston taxies are awful! We took 5 cab trips and all the taxies were very dirty - one smelled of vomit - and we're not sure if a few of the cars were safe. We had a Deluxe Room (one up from the standard) and it was comfortable and spacious. Nice touch with towel warmers.

I bid the hotel through priceline at almost half off the regular price. The hotel is conveniently located in Boston Downtown area. The room is a little small but the bathroom is very nice with two pieces of bath robe. The bedding is of good quality and of designer taste. The bed is very comfortable. Unlike the other hotel, we were provided with good size (3oz) of shampoo, conditioner, body wash and location, enough for 2 adults and 2 kids. We liked the smell as well. There was a flat panel TV, old fashion radio, a dorm size refrigerator and a free safe in the room. We got two free bottle of waters inside the refrig. This was very nice. Not sure about the room service since we moved from one king bed with a roll-away bed to a room with 2 double bed. We moved our luggage by ourselves since we were in a hurry for a tight schedule. There were a few things we were quite surprised: 1. Use the computer at the business center is free only for the first 15 minutes, After that it is 7 dollars (can not remember the exact amount) for the next hour. Wifi is free though. It cost 79 cents for a black and white print, about $1.5 for a color print. 2. The hotel has a third party company for velvet parking, which is $42 for a day. We ended up parked the rental car in the garage just two block away for $35 for those two days. 3. Since we booked the hotel through priceline, I got a king size bed for 4 of us, I called the hotel ahead of the time for 2 double beds. The man on the phone said they had no rooms with 2 double beds any more. It would cost us $20 for a roll-away bed per night.

We looked a over a dozen hotels in the Boston area and this one an obvious choice. You will see when you start your search. Trust me. Swing by this hotel and your choice will be easy. We started off with Tiffany, who was working with us over the course of the year leading up to the wedding. She was awesome. Represented the hotel extremely well, and made us feel relaxed the whole time. She was promoted and left the property and with a month to go, left us in the hands of Charlene Navarro. What a true professional. So much detail and vision went into the wedding planning with Tiffany and to have this wedding handed over with less then 30 days,would make any couple say \"oh boy.\" She was on her A game.Charlene got up to speed....and fast! She responded to every email promptly,called us back with answers, took the lead on planning and organizing her staff ,made suggestions that made the flow of the evening and look of the reception more appealing, and took care of details behind the scenes that we had not thought of to make the day more special. Also kudo's to Andrew who made the night run smoothly as well. The staff on a whole, was very professional and deserves to be commended. The front desk staff, the doormen, even the waitress' who work in Cuff's. We would stop in for a bite to eat or a drink after a planning session, and they would take the time to know our name and to ask how our planning was going. We had room blocks for our guests, and had several people stay from out of town. They can't stop talking about how great the Back Bay Hotel is. I travel with a Major League Baseball team for a living and stay at some of the best 5 star hotels in the country, and I will be honest and tell you, the Back Bay Hotel is in the same league as far as quality and service. EVERYONE who was involved in our wedding that weekend, kept mentioning service. Have I beat this topic to death yet? Food was amazing! Rooms were large and clean. Very affordable as well. You get a ton for your money and you get to custom design your menu, take over a resturant, and have staff you KNOW ...work for you. Great place for a wedding. They will throw in little touches and make you feel like you are their biggest VIP of the year,on your wedding weekend. I wish the wedding didn't fly by so I could have taken more of this in.

Tiffany helped with almost all of the original planning. Charlene and Andrew took over to execute the last minute details, the entire set-up and the coordination of EVERYTHING on the actual day. They were stars!!! The additional staff that served and cleared the food even stepped in to help with the best man speech (he had a flip chart). They were eager to please, answering everyone's questions and clearing the plates quickly. The bartender never seemed to have a line and always had a smile when I breezed by. Come to think of it, EVERYONE had a smile the entire time! The quality of the food was outstanding. We did a mix of \"upscale picnic\" food as we called it with sliders, fries, some Italian dishes and several desserts. The presentation was perfect. The price? Completely reasonable. We were on a budget and we stayed on budget. How many couples can say that?! Brides and grooms...don't be fooled by the bigger (more expensive) packages and don't try to do it all yourself with several vendors at an empty venu. Choose The Back Bay Hotel. It is beautiful so you don't need many decorations, the staff is top notch, the rooms are gorgeous and the food choices could not be better. You can make the menu your own, give the decor a few personal touches and you are on your way! Oh, and one extra bonus...they upgraded our room for free which totally made us feel like royalty! This was completely above and beyond our expectations. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for a place for a small wedding...or a big one!

I was going to stay at a different hotel, but I read too many reviews about bed bugs, so when I saw all the glowing reviews I had to stay at the Back Bay. Valet parking, check-in and out was effortless. The clerk that checked me in also checked me out, and remembered my name. I was impressed. It's small details like that which make for a great weekend. They have free Wi-Fi ,which so many of the large chains make you pay extra for these days. It gets to be tired the way the larger chains nickel and dime you for every service and amenity. The room was very nice. My room was a deluxe with a king size bed. It was exceptionally clean. I felt confident that there were no bed bugs. The bathroom was well stocked, four big bath towels and robes. I was a little disappointed when I saw that the toiletries were not Kiehls as I had seen on trip advisor, but my mom fell in love with them. In the deluxe rooms they feature Aromatherapy Associates brand. I'lll admit it smells great. I actually think I purchased a candle by them at another hotel. The best part was my mom asked me to order it when I got home, she has received several compliments. Sadly, the soap is only stocked in hotels. As for the restaurant and bar, I was impressed. I didn't have the breakfast buffet. I ordered a la cart from the menu. They have a nice selection. Sometimes, I find breakfast at hotels to be focused on the buffet. The service was very attentive, but not overly attentive, you could relax and let down your guard. The bar was nice. Again, there was a nice selection of bar food. The flat bread pizza was excellent. The only flaw that was found was about the air conditioning in our room. My mom found it too loud. Honestly, I thought it was fine. It blows a lot of air through a small vent. The location is great.

The hotel was okay but I was a little disappointed and it did not compare well to the hotel (same star value) that I subsequently stayed at in New York. The room was fine even if the decor was a bit staid and the bed comfortable. The bathroom (shower) was good and though it had a lot of space just had a shower - no bath. Couple of points 1. The light switch to turn off the lights was no where near the bed - I found this very odd as it meant you had to get out of bed to turn of the side table lights. 2. I tried to use the 'free' 15 mins internet access in the business centre to but failed as it did not recognise my card ( I paid elsewhere and the hotel bill with the card) .The card need to be swiped before I could log in 3. The bed covering and 'fancy' bolster were of a quite shiny (synthetic? ) material and quite old fashioned. The elevator had a very 'jazzy' reflection backwall - all reminded me of the '80s 4. Quite close to emergency services area so opening the window meant a lot of siren noise but the air con did not go low enough for me. 5. All the hallways had very low lighting. 6. I had thought I was getting a kettle/ coffeemaker in the room but was told only deluxe room got this. I really don't see why this can't be provided as standard - one of the front desk staff made a bit of a joke about it later which made me feel a little uncomfortable. 7. The selection of TV channels made me think it was focused on businessmen given the limited selection of general channel and then the large selection of US sports channels All this was not terrible and the room was fine but it suffered in comparison to a NYC hotel and to a Mariott that my friend stayed in in Boston that I saw and was much cheaper - I felt it was quite pricey for what you actually got..

We paid $6.00 for two small styrofoam cups of coffee. Parking for one night cost us $42.00. We had to move our car the second night to a garage that was not on a road that was closed. We found one just around the corner, and that one only cost us $27.00. We felt very over charged for everything at the hotel. The beds were very uncomfortable. Horrible to be honest. The female working the concierge, knew nothing as far as marathon info went. We asked for directions to the center where the expo was, and she had to google it! Why hadn't the manager prepped his employees? After she looked it up online, her directions were horrible. She told us it was 2 blocks away. Yes, if each block is about a mile each.

My husband and I arrived to the Back Bay hotel late in the evening, tired from a day filled with travel. The check-in process was efficient and the front desk clerk was friendly. The room was nice, but a little small. Each of us had two pieces of luggage (of average size) as well as a backpack. There was really no good place to put all of our luggage so that it was out of the way. We constantly had to rearrange the luggage so that we were not tripping over it. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the shades drown out all light in the room, so you don't have to worry about being woken up by the sun in the morning. However, it was very warm in our room one of the nights during our 4 night stay, which made it difficult to sleep. The bathroom was wonderful! It contained quite a bit of granite and was very large. The walk-in shower was very relaxing at the end of the day. The bath products provided by the hotel are some of the very best that I've had (from a hotel). There is a motion-activated nightlight in the bathroom, which is great to help you see in the middle of the night...but be careful - the light goes out quickly and only detects motion near the door of the bathroom (not near the toilet). The bathrobe and house shoes that were provided added a nice touch of comfort and home. The view out of the window was of an office building next door...not exactly picturesque, but not abnormal for a hotel in a large city. The walls inside of the hotel were pretty thin so be prepared to hear people walking around and talking, especially during the early evening. The turn down service was very nice. I thoroughly enjoyed the chocolates left on the bed in the evening. Overall, the service was excellent and the people who worked at the hotel were friendly and helpful. I would have appreciated a normal coffee pot in the room instead of a fancy espresso machine. And, for the money, I would have liked either a complimentary breakfast or an evening reception (or both). It would have made the stay more enjoyable. The high speed Internet was very slow for us. In fact, I used the 3G connection on my iPhone and was able to surf the Internet much faster than if I connected to the wifi. The location can't be beat.

For Christmas, I had received tickets to the BSO, and while we were seeking just a brief night away from home, we wanted to try something new, and after some Internet research, I settled on the Back Bay Hotel. It already had wonderful reviews and has a convenient location (across the street from Grill 23, two blocks away from either the Copley stop on the Green Line and the Back Bay stop on the Orange Line), so I booked us a Superior King room for a Saturday night. We arrived and were greeted by a very helpful and friendly woman at the front desk. She offered us the services of several different amenities, many of which we declined (no wake-up calls for us on Sunday morning). We found our room spacious and spotless, with a large bathroom, complete with heated towel rack and a shower with multiple shower heads. Perfect for relaxing. The room came with complimentary waters, a stereo system, and an espresso machine. After having enjoyed a hot shower, we stopped at their Irish bar, Cuffs, for some cocktails and an appetizer. The bartender was very friendly, and helped me with a drink choice off of their cocktail menu. We opted to share a cheese and charcuterie plate, which was enormous and marvelous. Later, when we returned to the hotel (around midnight), the bar was hopping with plenty of happy sounding patrons, and were we not exhausted and stuffed (after dining in the North End), we may have joined them again. After our night out, we returned to our room to see that we had received turndown service, complete with plush robes, slippers, and chocolates. The curtains completely blocked out any semblance of light and sound from the street below, so much so that when I woke up at 8am the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the sun had even risen - it was still relaxingly, quietly dark in the room until we opened the curtains. Though we were in a bit of a hurry to catch a train, we opted to try breakfast at the Stanhope Grille, the museum's full-service Irish-American restaurant. They have several a la carte menu items, but we both chose the well-stocked buffet. Happily stuffed on eggs, lox, and toast, we had a smooth and easy check out, and a charming doorman helped us with our bags to the taxi stand on the corner.

We held our ceremony at the Back Bay Hotel. Our guests stayed overnight there and we also treated everyone to breakfast in the hotel's Stanhope Grille the morning after the wedding. Planning with Tiffany [-] went smoothly and she was very helpful. She seemed to cover all the bases and reminded us of things we may have overlooked. I was confident things would go smoothly under her command. However, the day before the wedding, Tiffany emailed me that someone named Marcelo would be in charge of the event because she wasn't working the weekend of our wedding. We are pretty laid-back people. I used to moonlight doing a some wedding catering and I've seen it all . . . I also know that things go wrong and most things don't bother me. But after our weekend at the Back Bay, all I could think was that it seemed like the adults had gone away for the weekend and left a bunch of college kids to run the place. To begin, we had welcome bag/amenities we paid to have delivered to our guests rooms on Friday. We delivered them to the hotel around lunchtime on Friday. At 8 p.m. or so, my mom said she hadn't received her gift bag and we had to call the front desk to ask them to please deliver the welcome bags. On Saturday, I arrived at the hotel in my own car, in a wedding dress, with bags in hand. The valets took my car, but didn't help me with my multiple bags, which I struggled to get up the stairs. There were 3 valets just standing there, yacking with each other. I mean, how could you miss me in that big ol' dress? And how come the valets didn't know a bride was showing up? Where was Marcelo? I never saw him. Next, incorrect names were on the hotel event monitor screens that announced our wedding, even though I specifically spelled out in the contract which names (and the correct spellings) we wanted. (I have been previously married, and they used my ex-husband's last name, not my own last name. Also, a guest told me that the day before the monitors had my correct last name, but that it was spelled incorrectly.) A champagne toast with ginger ale option (specified in the contract) was supposed to be passed out as soon as my husband and I walked back down the aisle. No one from the hotel was there with the toast, and after waiting, I had to go to the front desk (where the staff was hanging around and joking) and ask them to please bring it out. It took them quite a bit of time to bring it, and when they did, there was no ginger ale for the kids and teetotallers. This took more time to rectify, which confused the guests, who were expecting a toast and couldn't figure out what was going on. During the toast, which was a speech given by one of our closest friends, the staff at the front desk was still joking, laughing and chatting so loudly that one of our guests had to excuse himself from the room and go ask the desk to keep it down so we could hear the speaker. My parents had invited our guests to breakfast at the Stanhope Grille in the hotel for Sunday morning. The hotel was supposed to apply the charges to our master account, but instead charged our guests for the breakfast. We had to have them back the charges out individually and reapply them to our master account. This was embarassing, because we intended to provide breakfast for everyone. Some guests who checked out prior to our realization of this error may have been billed for breakfast. I have to try to find out in a tactful manner who they were and try to rectify the situation. When we left, the bellman took our bags out to the car. The silver cake stand that we needed to return to our bakery was with the bags. When I retrieved it from the trunk of the car to put in the front seat for the drive home, I noticed it had been dropped and had a large dent on one side. The dent occurred in the five minute span of time that the bellman had the luggage trolley with our bags. No one would take responsibility for it. My husband had had enough nonsense by now, and went to the front desk to complain. He really got upset when the girl at the desk listened to him and then said, \"Oh well, things happen.\" Finally, I learned today that at least one guest had left wedding gifts for us at the front desk. They had requested the gifts be delivered to our room. We never received them. We are currently missing a few gifts, one was a magnum of Veuve Clicquot champagne. It's pretty uncomfortable when your relatives call you to see if you liked the gift they left for you and you have no idea what they're talking about. I don't even know how to go about asking people if they left gifts for us at the front desk, nor can I imagine a way they can make this up to us and my relatives who paid for gifts that can't be located. The Back Bay Hotel is very nice, clean and seems like it has everything going in its favor. I was really shocked by the apathy and lack of focus we experienced. By contrast, definitely have your wedding reception at Mistral. Everything was executed in an exceptional manner. The staff is lovely, attentive and friendly. The food is exquisite and the room has a fantastic vibe. Couldn't be better.

From Sean who greets you on the street, the valet team, Jaime in the Stan Hope Grill, the concierge who tended our bags in the absence of the bellman and the front desk reception staff, first impressions are lasting. The property is well-maintained, the King Suites roomy, clean and quiet and the artwork and sculptures throughout the property are pleasing. Every detail is taken into consideration even down to the potpourri in the ashtray section of the hallway waste receptacles! Our stay was further enhanced by the little extras like complimentary wi-fi, the heated towel rack, stereo system and upscale toiletries in our suite. Breakfast in the Stan Hope Grille was really good and Jaime was very attentive. The location is perfect to explore the city on foot, just blocks from Copley Square.

Personally, I'd have preferred a comfy chair and reading lamp than the table with the nepresso machine (they provide complimentary coffee downstairs anyway). The lighting in the room wasn't great anyway -- hard to read in bed at night without having a tiny book light. The bathroom, while spacious, with a separate tub and shower, was cold (seemingly no heat) and the large window wasn't frosted in any way, so anyone could look in from surrounding tall buildings and you couldn't really appreciate the natural light.

We tried to take an afternoon nap when we arrived but were unable to with all the noise. The hallway noise is even worse. And I agree with others that the room service is exorbitantly priced. We paid $25 for 2 waters, an apple and a coke! This was our first time in Boston and we don't know what the competition is like but we will probably try a different hotel next time.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cTrendy Little Gem\u201d", "Author": "Kjasie", "ReviewID": "UR90466417", "Content": "I stayed at the Back Bay hotel for 3 nights last month on a business trip.

I ordered room service one morning since the restaurant didn't open in time for me to make my business meeting. The room service came promptly (food still piping hot); however, my order was incorrect. They quickly fixed it (within 5 minutes). Overall I would definitely recommend staying at the Back Bay.

We had terrific weather in Boston - picture perfect blue sky - which made our stay even more delightful, with the leaf fall framing our pictures beautifully.

This hotel is housed in what used to be the Boston Police Department headquarters, so I've always been wanting to stay here and see how they transformed this landmark building. While I did not pay for my stay, I'm writing this review with the mindest of how I would view this hotel if I had actually paid for the room based on the current prices listed on their website. (which is currently listed at $195 for a Superior King for the month of December 2010) Check in was smooth, personable, and very friendly. I was made to feel right at home and even offered a warm towel to freshen up. The staff also asked me if I already had dinner plans and was more than eager to offer suggestions. My room was a Superior King and was very spacious and full of all kinds of unique and helpful items that set this hotel apart from other hotels I've stayed at in this class. For starters, it's stocked with a great selection of amazing Kiehls bath products. They also have a towel warmer, hair dryer, iron, safe, and an empty fridge, so you can go out and buy your own things and keep them cold. Many hotels overstock the mini bar, so you can't really use the fridge for anything you might want to buy on your own. In my opinion, this was better and if I really needed anything else they have 24 hour room service. The bathroom had a motion triggered nightlight which was so helpful in the middle of the night. Never saw that in a hotel before and think every hotel should have them. Clever. There is also a really nice CD player and sound system with a remote control, a huge flat screen television, free wifi as well as an ethernet cable for laptops and a large desk. (One thing that they didn't have in the room that I felt would be a nice addition is a DVD player, but perhaps that will come in the future.) The room was also very quiet, as it was in the back part of the hotel. Not sure how the front facing rooms are for sound, but my room was really quiet, the bed was very comfortable, and I slept very well. Another great feature of this hotel is the amount of drawer space for your clothes. Many hotels either have just one drawer for your clothes or just enough for one guest. While I was a solo traveler, I noticed at least 3 large drawers on each side of the bureau as well as plenty of space in each of the nightstands and a very large closet. Plenty of space for two guests to store clothes. My room didn't have any views, and I'm really not sure what views the other room would offer in this part of town, but I wouldn't expect too much in that regard since the hotel is surrounded by lots of other buildings. Breakfast was also very good. They have an extensive buffet option, but I chose to order from the menu. The bar area is also very nice, with a very cool and modern fireplace. There are also lots of great restaurants nearby, including Geoffrey's that offers great comfort food and cocktails at surprisingly low prices and Grill 23 which is a really great steakhouse with typical steakhouse prices. Overall I had a really nice experience and I will definitely be suggesting this hotel to my friends and family.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cStayed for the third time in four years!\u201d", "Author": "Shnboston", "ReviewID": "UR88791296", "Content": "Having returned to stay at The Back Bay Hotel for the third time in four years says it all!

The type of trip where the comfort of the hotel mattered as we might spend loads of time just lazing in the room. We used trip advisor to find this hotel and narrowed down our choice between the Back Bay and the Mandarin Oriental based on comments. Not that we don't spend $300 a night on hotels...but we just couldn't justify it based on the images, reviews, location etc. of the Back Bay Hotel. We decided to book it and then if necessary visit the Mandarin for dinner or spa. We spent 3 nights at Back Bay for roughly the cost of 1 at the Mandarin. The rooms are small, we were warned so booked the 'deluxe' and i was still a little taken back by how condensed the rooms were, but by the time I awoke the next morning, I was settled in and was happy for the corner room with lots of natural light coming from both sets of windows and a very spacious bathroom (no tub). The first morning we were awaken by the maid service at 8 a.m. ish....they were talking in the hallway then actually knocked on the door. This was a surprise for me, I think the earliest housekeeping has ever knocked. They then continued to vacuum around 9 a.m. (Bay Bay Hotel would recommend you start this activity later in the morning). The second night we put up the 'do not disturb' sign before going to bed and discovered our room actually was a part of a set of 2 rooms that had a door separating us from the main hallway so we closed this too and were not awaken on the 2nd morning. For breakfast, it is worth the savings to put on some clothes and go downstairs to the buffet, our first day breakfast was US$70 and the food is below average. The food doesn't improve downstairs, but at least it costs much less. The Concierge, after making our booking we recieved a very nice email a day or so later introducing us to their concierge services (bonus points) however we struggled to connect with the desk before we traveled. We called from Miami before boarding our flight to Boston to book our luxury transfer to the hotel since we were landing at midnight, but the Concierge had left for the day and the young boy at the desk speaking to my boyfriend on the phone recommended we take a taxi....not the right answer, we live in the Caribbean and had not yet adjusted to the temperature change so standing in a line waiting on a taxi (although less than 15 minutes) wasn't what I had in mind. However, the next day we met the lady working at concierge and she was the best concierge person EVER so this cancels out the fact the front desk don't do quite such a good job at it in her absence. So basically the trick is not to compare this hotel to the Mandarin, they are not the same category, but if you compare it to a Hilton or a Mariott the Back Bay comes out with flying colours on the rooms. Food could use some improvement, bagels were stale and smoke salmon lots of brown bits. However, the chicken sandwich on the dinner room service was Excellent, so breakfast is really the area that missed the bar. Another point, not critical but once our taxi dropped us off at midnight, because of the one way streets we were let off at a door where the bar was and the street was littered with University students who were out on a Friday night. When we got through the doors no easy sign to tell you to get in the elevator to go up one floor to the reception area. Not a nice welcome. The side door is the taxi pick up and drop off area, better signage or a bell person at the door, especially at night would be a nice touch. The room got 2 free bottles of water on a night, really warm robes, slippers, towel warming racks in the bathroom, fabulous bathroom products, sensor light under the sink counter when you open the door at night (nice comfort feature) etc. are all the reasons we feel this hotel exceeds its price category. We were not familiar with Boston, but between the concierge and the location of the hotel itself we were perfectly positioned to become fast learners.

We recently returned from the Back Bay Hotel after staying at the Ritz-Carlton a few times. We were not disappointed in the least. Even before we arrived, I was contacted by the concierge (Heather). I arranged for in-room massages (Rolling River Massage Co.) since it was November (brrrr), and there was no spa on site. Heather arranged everything for us. Location: Very convenient, Walk to green line and orange line T stations were short. Shopping and the Common very nearby. Great location. We flew in from JFK (it was actually cheaper to fly than to drive -- as bad as gas prices are now -- and to park in the hotel lot). We didn't want to search for street parking on the holiday weekend, so left the car at home. Everything we needed was local, even trips to Cambridge by taking the T. Front desk: Staff were very pleasant, and our room was ready very early since we had an early flight from NY. They were all helpful and also gave us a late check out time. We had dinner reservations at a VERY local place (Erbaluce) however, the front desk staff had not heard of it. It was highly rated and fabulous. I made sure the desk staff knew of the restaurant (to refer others to), since it is right around the corner. Have a few reviews upcoming for great restaurants we went to, so look for those under my screen name if you're interested. Rooms: We had a corner deluxe room with separate walk-in shower. Room was very comfortable, nice-sized. Bed was comfy. Room noise from street was a bit loud, but that was really the only drawback for the room. We were given champagne and chocolate to celebrate my birthday. A very nice touch to say the least. Nice robes to use (and slippers), towel warmer ... very clean, too. **FREE-WIFI HOTEL WIDE was a big bonus.** Restaurant: We had breakfast at the hotel three mornings. Moderately expensive, especially for the buffet. If you're like me and don't eat a ton of carbs, order off the menu. Portions are large enough (for breakfast) that you actually get more if you order a traditional breakfast (or oatmeal like my husband did) than if you try to find good stuff at the buffet. The buffet had good choices, don't misunderstand, but we don't eat many carbs (muffins, pancakes, french toast, etc.) Fruit was not too flavorful, since it's out of season. Waitstaff very nice.

This was the most expensive hotel of the trip and I chose it because of the excellent reviews on this site - My initial experience was favourable as the young lady who checked me in was very pleasant and managed to put me in a room with a bath . It went downhill after that . The room was quite small for the price . A major disappointment was the fact that there was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and this is where the trouble began - I need a cuppa first thing in the morning to get going so on the first morning I opted to go down and have the hotel breakfast rather than get dressed and go out in search of coffee or use the hotel coffee shop - Breakfast was not included in the extortionate price charged for the room . I'm a bit of a free spirit and went down to breakfast barefoot - the man who seated me glanced at my feet and I was aware that he realised I was not wearing shoes but he said nothing . I was seated and told that someone would come over to take my order , whereupon I was supplied with coffee by a waiter who clearly did not understand my British English very well as the waffles I requested never arrived. The rest of the breakfast was a buffet , which was adequate but quite disappointing and ruined by the fact that the restaurant manager chose to come over halfway through my meal and inform me that it was 'against health and safety regulations ' for me to not be wearing shoes ,admittedly they offered to get me some from my room but I was then further interrupted by them telling me that they did not want to go in to my room as I had left the do not disturb sign on the door - overall I felt this was a very embarrassing and humiliating experience and that they only wanted me to put shoes on as I was probably lowering the tone of their establishment - I wonder if I had been wearing my Rolex and jewellery if the attitude would have been different ? I feel at they should not have allowed me to be seated in the first place and if they had had a kettle in the room this would not have happened . I was massively disappointed with this hotel compared with the reviews given.The internet was free but slow , the fitness room was hardly bigger than my room . To be fair ,the location was excellent , the bed was comfortable , the towels large enough for my plus size frame and the toiletries supplied were nice quality but I cannot justify the cost of this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone and I would never stay there again as there are plenty of other hotels in that price point nearby .", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Horsham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCan't fault but nothing great\u201d", "Author": "angus s", "ReviewID": "UR81565086", "Content": "Have stayed in the hotel half a dozen or so times now, mainly due to familiarity and it serves me well: good location - walking distance to good variety of restaurants, the park, Prudential and Copley malls; rooms are all a decent size, with comfortable beds; good breakfast; always v clean and staff all polite and helpful.

The minute you walk through the doors, you can't help but appreciate the modern decor. And the entrance and lobby areas are neither huge nor sterile so you don't feel like you're in a mega-hotel/warehouse, which is how I felt the minute I walked into the Marriott. And front desk service is prompt and very friendly and quick to help when asked. As for the room, we had a Superior Room with two double beds and it was plenty large enough . . . not small at all. The room was clean and attractive, the beds comfortable with nice linens and a typical flat screen tv as you expect to find in any decent hotel these days. A/C worked just fine too. And there was plenty of closet and drawer space for clothing. But the best part of the room in my opinion was the over-sized bathroom. There's no tub, but the shower was great, modern and featured a light body sprayer. I appreciated the fact that the high glass shower door prevented the bathroom mirror from getting all fogged up. There was a heated towel rack which although of little use at the beginning of September was still a nice touch. The bathroom also featured high end Kiehl's toiletries. I was also really pleased that the hotel provided free high speed internet service, and it was plenty fast. I'm tired of getting nickeled and dimed at hotels so make sure you take into account the free internet when comparing hotel rates. Location was great in the heart of Back Bay. You're a very short walk to many restaurants, Newberry St., the T, Chinatown, and more. Even if you plan on seeing the historical sights and the Freedom Trail, this is the perfect location because of its proximity to both the T and nightlife/restaurants. When I return to Boston, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

We had a room on the 5th floor w/ 2 double beds and upon walking in, we were like WOW! But wait..., then we saw our bathroom and were like DOUBLE WOW!! It was HUGE and Beautiful- seperate tub, walk-in shower for it seemed like 4 people , towel warmers, bathrobes, granite countertops, nice bath products...I could have stayed in the bathroom the whole time and would have been content...even the window treatment was top-notch. Now there were a few things I didn't care for or that can be improved upon: 1. Clock in rooms are not lighted so it's difficult to see time in the dark 2. The nespresso maker was just \"ok\". The coffee wasn't that good. Better off having regular coffee makers since not everyone likes espresso. 3. Fan in bathroom did not work Can't think of anything else but the nice touches such as the slippers, chocolates and turn-down service far outweigh these minor things.

Took luggage to room. All of this took about 40 minutes. 3. Went to curb to get the car and was told by Valet we were gone too long and the charge was $18, which he put in his pocket! 4. Went to lounge that evening for a drink before dinner. Server brought our first drink. We waited a considerable time (about 20 minutes) for a refill. She was nowhere to be found. Husband goes to bar and she is sitting at the end flirting with gentlemen guests. He had to request a refill. She was embarrassed, she was caught. 5. Went to room to catch the news. TV language and prompts were in Spanish. Looked for Channel programming card to change language on remote. Not in room. Called concierge, asked if he could guide me through so I could change language program, he said he didn't know how to do that. Would send someone up immediately. 2 hours later front desk calls to ask if we had trouble with the TV. I said \"too little, too late\" and hung up the phone!!! 6. Air conditioning in room was noisy and did not cool. We had to set it on fan all night. Did not call any staff member to help because at that point we knew this was useless. 7. No in room coffee next morning. Came down to lobby seeking complimentary hotel coffee. Most hotels have this service for their guests. Concierge pointed me to a room. Went there and found the guest ahead of me paying for coffee. Thought I was in the wrong room. Went back to concierge and asked if the Back Bay had complimentary coffee for their guests. Was abruptly told, \"NO\". We went down the street to a small business coffee shop, paid more but that was NOT the issue. I have written to the general manager and the CEO of this chain. They have a staff that is more invested in their personal satisfaction and interests than in guest \"HOSPITALITY\". They do not seem to be aware of what that concept means.

He made it clear that they were not required to hold any rooms and our reservation was only a request; in addition had we booked our room through the actual hotel website and not a 3rd party (travelocity) then the reservation would have been guaranteed. He would simply not budge and it was 1am. I retired after begging for something to make up for the poor service we were receiving and got breakfast comped and some champagne.

You are only 3 blocks to the Boston Common which is where the Freedom Trail starts and only 5 or 6 blocks from the original Cheers bar. I can't say enough about the hotel.

I was pleased to find that it was. I think something that this chain is doing better than other hotel chains is their customer service. We stayed at this hotel because my husband was running the Boston Marathon and because of our positive experience in Dublin. The Back Bay hotel has an excellent location for the marathon\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the hotel was quite a busy place. What I found that was consistent with the Croke Park Hotel was that the staff was so professional. The concierge at the Back Bay Hotel was amazing. I think most reasonable people would have started to become annoyed at the endless chain of questions our group of five had for him. But, he was such a gentleman, and had such a great demeanor. He even double-checked with my husband to be sure he was clear on the transportation process for the runners to get to the start of the marathon. Another feature that was really nice with this hotel was that their adjoining rooms connect a little differently than what I have seen in the past. Instead of having a door between the rooms, they have made the ends of the hallway rooms adjoining. So, we had a private hallway with a locked door, and then we could chose to either lock our doors or leave them open. I felt this offered another level of security (all three locked doors at night), and it also made it so there was absolutely no hallway noise. This hotel was actually one of the quietest hotels I have stayed in! This hotel certainly has the staff to make it world-class. For example, even though the restaurant and bar were overwhelmed with marathoners after the race\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI could tell the staff was trying so hard to please everyone. I caught a couple of workers on the verge of a run trying to serve people. (And the food was good!) My only suggestion to this hotel would be to pay slightly more attention to detail to take it to the next level. The carpet in our room was showing a little wear\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand they could have added little touches like fresh flowers in the rooms, or chocolates on the pillows, or linen squares on the floor by the beds.

I checked the reviews and they were generally fine so I purchased the package estimating that the hotel portion was about $175-$195 per night so my expectations were high. Upon arrival I found the hotel to be a boutique type of facility with potentially limited amenities. Initially, the two bed room seemed OK, reasonably clean, if a little cramped in the bed area. Now for the scary part - I went out to dinner and upon returning I heeded nature's call and sat down to use the toilet. I made sure to wipe it down first before putting my bottom on it and the alcohol wipe came back dirty - not good. Yet considering the urgency of the moment I proceeded. Moments later when I reached for the toilet tissue I looked at the wall next to the bowl and my stomach sank and I immediately felt ill - there was a foot long streak of what looked like human feces smeared across the wall. Clearly the guest before me was not happy with this hotel. I immediately went to the front desk to report the issue and demanded that the Housekeeping manager see this repulsive sight. About 10 minutes later Mr. D.-- came up to my room and viewed the brown streak and deemed it 'unacceptable'.

The location is perfect for walking to the convention center for meetings or the opposite direction for seeing some of Boston's history. Newbury Street, Boston Commons, Beacon Hill, Faneuil Hall and the Hynes Convention Center are all within easy walking distance. The hotel feels like a boutique hotel and it was nice to be on the edge of the convention mob instead of in the midst of it which meant quieter nights and more intimate public places. Complimentary bottled water was a fabulous touch. A Panasonic CD/Radio system was great especially with a selection of discs to 'check-out' at the front desk. Our room did not have a coffee maker but what did that matter when they offered free Starbucks in the lobby! And there was a mini fridge with wide open shelves for your own purchased snacks. There's a grocery two blocks away and soda and snacks are easy to pick up at Walgreen's or CVS within walking distance. No over-priced mini-bar! The bathroom was stocked with Kiehl's toiletries. The towels were a bit stiff and rough but they were generously sized and there were lovely terry robes to cuddle up in after a shower. The only thing I did not like about the room was the 'Master Switch'. If you needed to use the bathroom in the middle of the nght you had to turn on the master switch in order to turn on the bathroom light. Unfortunately, this also turned on the ceiling light outside the bathroom which illuminated everything - not great for the person still trying to sleep. The concierges were friendly and helpful though when we inquired about a local sandwich shop, they had no idea where one was and spent quite a bit of time on the computer looking for one without success.

The bathroom in our room was long and narrow. The towel rack was at one end, the shower at the other. There were 2 hooks for the bathrobes, but even those were too far from the shower to be useful. * the clock was not digital.

A couple tips: * parking at 10 St. James Ave. (entrance to the garage on Stuart St. as well) was $14/day on the weekends. * avoid the Stanhope Grill for breakfast.

They have their own garage - week nights run about 39$ and weekend overnights run 20$ a shot! - kinda pricey! on a side note though - if you dont mind a short walk - the Boston Commons Gargage is only about 15 mins away and parking is much cheaper - weekends starting at $11 a night! - i think week days are 20$ which is still cheaper!!! :) All in all though it was a great trip and we will definatly consider this hotel again! :)", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY, NY", "Title": "\u201cno frills yet lovely hotel..\u201d", "Author": "apples99", "ReviewID": "UR54605642", "Content": "We were in Boston during the Thanksigivng break stayed here.

We had booked room only in a standard room which was a good size with plenty of wardrobe space and a well equipped shower/bathroom. Room was very clean with a good large and really comfortable bed with excellent pillows. The Hotel is well located close to the main street of Royalston where you quickly get your bearings for Copley Place, main shopping centres, the public gardens and beyond to Quincy Market and the harbour area. There is a cab rank within feet of the Hotel entrance. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful and on the few occasions we used room service for breakfast we were delighted by the speed, organisation and presentation of the refreshments. When eating out do try Durkin Park (Quincy Market) and The Cheesecake Factory (115 Huntington Avenue) for good inexpensive food and really interesting but different atmospheres. This was a return visit to Boston which remains a nice, compact and safe City to walk around and use the hop on hop off buses to get your bearings and see the sights at the wider locations. In the good weather months take the Duck Tour and see the city from the river. Overall a great stay in a delightful Hotel where our only criticisms would be the lack of Tea/Coffee making facilities in the room and rather inadequate double glazing which let traffic noise into the room. Everything else was of a very high standard with very friendly and professional staff. Our special thanks to Ryan (Night Concierge) who dealt most promptly and effectively with noisy people in the next room in the early hours of one morning.

The food was just excellent. We arrived quite late on our first night and we went straight to the hotel bar - I ordered a pint and some Buffalo Wings and the beloved had Buffalo Shrimp. Massive portions and very tasty. We paid extra for breakfast each mornign as we had booked on a bed only basis, but the food and staff were so good, we didn't mind the extra expense. We only had a proper sit down dinner in the hotel restaurant ( Satnhope Grill ) on our final night and it really was Beautiful. Cuffs bar seemed to be the hot spot on a Saturday night, when I went outside there was a huge queue to get in. It's a nice bar, but it's not a wonderbar - see what I did there? Boston on the whole seems to be quite laid back though - it was very hard to get a drink after 1 am and even the more raucous student bars were a bit subdued. I had a very relaxing time though and the hotel definitely helped. It's an excellent city and I felt safe walking around at 4 am to be honest. It's in a nice area with loads of restaurants and shops very close by. My girlfriend had arranged the trip for my birthday and when the hotel learned this, they sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne to my room.

I've been around the world and back and I have seen all the amazing places of the world. I actually used trip advisor to help me pick a hotel in Boston's Back Bay area since so many seemed wonderful. The reviews on this hotel sold me, so now I feel it's my duty to do what I can to show my appreciation for this gem of a hotel. I returned earlier this afternoon from the Back Bay Hotel after spending a long weekend in Boston. Let me just say that the hotel and every single aspect lived up to what I expected from reading the reviews. I picked up my friend from the airport and we arrived to the hotel before noon. We drove up and instantly were greeted with friendly service. The valet attendants were pleasent and very accomidating. They unloaded all of our bags for us and then when we went in to the front desk. They had available a room on the third floor, but asked if we would consider going out for lunch and allowing them to prepare us a room on the top floor. They offered us a beverage and to store our bags. We went out to lunch at \"Souper salad\" and then received a call maybe thirty minutes later, letting us know our room was now ready. We returned to the hotel, checked in and then proceeded up to our room. The bell boy brought our bags up right behind us. The hotel appearance was beautiful. The bar and restaurant were on the bottom floor and taking the glass staircase with the waterfall up to the main lobby with the beautiful chandeliers and vintage furtniture...fabulous! We had a standard room with two double beds and a fabulous view! The beds were extremely lush and comfortable. There was a desk and comfortable chair for all the work on my laptop. We had a mini fridge, flat screen television, as well as TWO closets. You almost never find that in a hotel. I must also note their was a safe in one of the closets, very convenient especially if you're traveling with lots of cash and electronics. Also they offer complimentary wireless which in this day and age is always a plus! The bathroom was lovely, encased in marble. The vanity was large and with a granite counter top, the towels were soft and fluffy and there was a towel heater...great for the winter. I also must note the excellent rainfall shower head and the fabulous smelling shampoos, lotions, and soaps they provided. We did not partake in room service, however we did eat at the restaurant one night, The Stanhope Grille. I had the filet and it was excellent. They also brought a complimentary hors d'oeuvres over to us. The service was superb! We did not take in the bar either, not our scene but it seemed lively. I did wonder if it would make our room noisy, however we didn't hear a thing. No loud music from the bar, no street noise from the bussling street below, just peace and quiet. When we left each day, the maids came in and made up the room. No complaints whatsoever, they did a fine job. They made the beds, replenished the water (2 free bottles per day), fresh towels, fresh toiletries, and all that jazz. We did the valet parking, $39 dollars per day BUT with unlimited in/out priviledges and speedy service. It's comparable to any place in Boston and well worth it. I would note names of those who were particularly helpful, but I find it unneccessary seeing as everyone we encountered was just above and beyond accomidating. The concierge was such a help and the front desk staff was equally wonderful! Everything about this hotel makes it top notch, but the location is out of this world. It seems as though everything is within walking distance and for those things not within walking distance, the Arlington T station was right around the corner. We used it once to visit and see Fenway Park and Hynes convention center. We went on a one mile walk and saw the Boston Common, Cheers bar, and then Park Plaza for shopping and dinner. Newbury street is just two blocks away and their are restaurants and more shopping in the vicinity, absolutely amazing location. Some suggestions for dining: 1) Legal Seafoods (Park Plaza) 2) Smith and Wollenskys Steak House (Arlington Street) 3) Fire and Ice - Sunday Brunch (Stuart Street) So overall, my experience was just sheer perfection.

I booked through their website, for an average of 250pn excl tax for a deluxe room. Check In was actually a slightly protracted affair and there weren't enough hot towels at reception for all of us. It doesn't matter so much to me, but it is one of the signs that the Back Bay is not the utmost in luxury. That said, everything does have an upscale feel and if you take the check in as a negative point, it only got better. The room was comfortable with views onto the streets. The king bed was making me want to linger on it forever. The bathroom was clean and had nice toiletries as well as bathrobes that I wish I cut have squeezed into my suitcase. What else - complimentary wifi worked hassle-free. Staff, including Concierge, were were friendly and even more helpful. Room service prompt, with some simple items such as hot water (for our own tea) brought without any charge. It's hard to point anything in particular, since everything was just as it should be, entirely uncomplicated. We also tried the Stanhope Grill, twice for breakfast, once for dinner. We chose from the buffett, where everything was fresh and of high quality, but the choice may indeed be larger at \"true\" luxury hotels. But dinner was the real smacker - the restaurant is overlooked like so many of its hotel peers and it shouldn't be. The room wasn't full, not helping the atmosphere, but our waiter, drawn from an old English movie apparently, more than made up for it. But the food was the real highlight - I had, among others, the Filet Mignon and rarely if ever have I eaten a better steak (neither in the UK, nor US). Sides were equally excellent. I frankly didn't expect this. Ok, any negatives? Well, not many. The hotel seems to have just to guest lifts, which only was a problem when one day one of the staff lifts broke down. It was more an annoyance to them than to us. And once I got a flippant answer on the room service. But that's already it. So, if you want a very comfortable hotel for both business (I quickly peeked into the conference area) and leisure without wanting to pay for staff standing 3m apart without further business than wishing you good night, than this is it. I'm normally not inclined to give an \"excellent\" since doing very well what you promised you would do is already an accomplishment many fail to deliver. The Back Bay is a very good hotel and the reason I gave 5 points is not that its service is unique - I had comparable service and attention to detail at other hotels - but rarely without paying a lot more for it.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cA Great Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "symoncurtis", "ReviewID": "UR47238595", "Content": "We booked this hotel due to the reviews on this forum and i have to say i am very pleased we did. OK it may be a bit pricey but i do believe you get value for money and the location is great being only a short walk from many major areas like the Prudential Centre, Boston Common, Newbury Street and countless bars and restaurants. We were given an exceptional welcome on arrival and the front desk staff couldn't do enough for us. The room itself was a good size, very clean, very comfortable and very quiet. Lots of nice extras were in the room too like a safe and an ironing board and iron which were nice touches and very useful. Strangely though no tea/coffee making facility? The only downside to the room was the lighting which was quite poor and the switches seemed to operate the lights in a very peculiar way meaning the bathroom light wouldnt go on unless the main light was on?? Still, a minor niggle all things considered. We used room service once for breakfast and everything arrived as ordered and on time though it could have been a bit hotter. Oh and we got a complimentary newspaper each morning sent to the room too. Nice. The public areas of the Hotel are modern, clean and welcoming. There is a nice bright and airy lounge area to sit and read the papers if you like and a very handy little area with two computers to access the internet which was great for checking up on areas to visit , booking tour tickets etc. We had breakfast once in the hotels Stanhope Grill Restaurant. Very good service again and a very nice meal but again on the pricey side at $60 for two people! There is also a bar called Cuffs where we had a meal the night we arrived. The food was excellent and the service great. This was more reasonably priced too considering the portion sizes which were excellent. The drinks though were again very expensive. One other thing to note about the bar though is it could quite possibly be the loudest place on Earth, even when only half full! One other thing to note from a financial point of view when budgeting for your stay, there are three taxes to add on to the room rate which will add between $35 - $40 dollars per night.

The bellboy brought our bags to the room and insisted on putting mine on the suitcase stand so that I didnt have to lift it. We didnt use the bar (it was very very busy) but we did use the (free) internet on the PCs in the lounge area. This was a nice touch as normally you have to pay for internet connection. The concierge was also very helpful. The location was good. We are happy to walk most places anyway but we happily did the freedom trail and walked down to Little Italy and back at night; this took about 20 minutes on foot.

Swiftly, and with some compensation, our heater was fixed upon the engineer arriving the next morning, and then we were moved when mgmnt. agreed that we, indeed, had been given one of the noiser rooms despite our noted request for a quiet room. Additionally, Kamid (gosh, I think I may be crucifying his name, but he functions as the concierge and answered the phone at the front desk, too, I believe) was a doll--he was so helpful with every inquiry and request--the Amtrak schedule to and from Providence and getting a remote for me for the TV in the exercise room as well as calling engineering, again, to up the temperature in the fitness room since you could see your breath (sort of) when you exhaled; it was so cold down there. Cesar and Maria, both in managerial positions, were both so helpful about the problems we were having--really very 4 Seasons in their approach--the willingness to take care of things and without any attitude that has become fairly common in the service industry. The room service food was very good--the lobster bisque was good, and the pulled pork sandwich was excellent, twice, with no grizzle. We had a mess-up with the yummy coffee bean gelato dessert, and room service rectified it by sending another one, without charging. My exclusive criticism of the hotel would be to somehow make the room phone connect to the different entities--housekeeping, room service, concierge--without having to bother the nice folks at the front desk.

When it came our turn we were told that our room was not ready and that it should be approximately an hour or less and that they would contact us via cell. (We also had the 4:10 Sox game to make.) Thinking the wait would be no more than an hour, we went downstairs and had a bit to eat. With no call to our cell, we went back upstairs to check on our room. The woman at the counter had to call housekeeping to check and again told us to wait and that it would only be a few moments. After another 35 minutes (of sitting in the lobby) we asked again and were told it was not ready - after she made another call to housekeeping - as it was obvious she had hardly been checking on it in our absence. (You would have thought that with all of these calls to housekeeping they could have asked them to make cleaning our designated room a priority.) After another 20 minutes wait or so, the Concierge noticed that we were now standing in the lobby and asked us if she could help. She literally went behind the desk and got keys for our room. (Two hours after we had arrived.) It is understandable that a room might not be ready upon ur arrival, but it would have been nice if they told us the truth, or even appeared to have our interest in mind while they basically strung us along for two hours. We might have found somehting more interesting to do than to hang around the lobby becoming frustrated. Oh, and we were late for the game. The other issue was that we had booked a package that included amenities like breakfast, a movie, room service popcorn, etc. yet no mention was made of this. We had to ask SEVERAL front desk personnel, none of whom seemed to understand what we were talking about. We never did find out what we were supposed to do to have our complimentary breakfast becasue we got tired of asking if we needed a voucher or some such thing. Upon checkout we fortunately dealt with a professional gentleman who at least took off our room servcice charges for the 2 beers we had odered the night before. He explained that we simply had to go and have breakfast and the front desk would remove the charges (no other employee seemed to know this).

We told her we were in a rush and needed to make the 4:10pm game at Fenway - she said no problem - we went and ate lunch and returned at 3pm.

We were checked in a very clean room with nice amenties, albeit many did not work properly such as the espresso machine and stereo - which had one small window which faced the interiorof the building. We had to rush to get a cab and did not arrive at the game until halfway through the first inning, which was very disappointing. Upon checkout the next morning our bill came and was NOT adjusted to show the reduced rate for the King room as we were assured it would. When my husband went down to the desk to point this out the gentleman working informed him that the man working the prior day had been mistaken in telling us that - which was ridiculous and not our problem as far as we were concerned - and after telling him this he finally honored the previous front desk workrs promise. And then he offered us breakfast - whichhad already been promised to be taken care of the day before - although there was no note of that.

We waited quite a while for the promised bell-boy to move our cases and had to phone up and remind them.

If I had been disabled, I wouldn't have been impressed. Next morning when I asked if we could have an alternative room, we were offerd one without hesitation. Sadly the lock didn't work on this one. Thankfully we hadn''t moved in. Room number four was lovely - an upgrade from our original booking and everything in working order.

This is not the first hotel where I have experienced this and the main problem is that the room keeps warming up when I'm sleeping. The first night, I just waved my arms around every couple hours. I simply had to mention this to the front desk staff and the engineer was in the room teaching us how to get it to work just right. Awesome! We did have dinner at Cuffs, a bar style restaurant in the hotel and thought it was pretty good, if not standard, bar food. Prices were reasonable for a downtown hotel. We didn't eat any other meals here but were able to locate a Starbucks and Au Bon Pain for breakfast nearby. From a location perspective, this hotel is just a couple of blocks from shopping, the Esplanade, Boston Commons, etc. It was pretty quiet on the weekend as most of the surrounding buildings are businesses. Perhaps the best part was that access to the Esplanade for 4th of July fireworks was just a few short blocks away. What put this hotel above and beyond in my book was something that felt like a disaster when it first happened. I collect the plastic souvenier soda cups from baseball stadiums and I left my Fenway cup in the room. It honestly looks like a disposable cup and unfortunately, housekeeping did throw it away. When I realized what had happened, I talked to the front desk manager and he indicated he was going to Fenway in just a few days, took all of my information and offerred to buy me a new cup and mail it to my home in Seattle. I was VERY skeptical I would ever see that cup and I know it sounds so dumb over a $6 drink cup. Just a few days after we got home, that cup arrived via Fed Ex.

I was not disappointed. When I drove in, the valet was at the sidewalk to greet me. Our bags were loaded up to our room and the front desk attendant upgraded our room to a \"deluxe double\". The room was large enough for me and my two teenage boys. The bathroom was large with nice toiletries. There was a tub and a separate shower in our bathroom. The shower had great pressure and hot water. Maid service was excellent. Our room was cleaned everyday and our bed turned down every night. Two free waters were in the fridge everyday. The fridge was a fair size, so if you like to stock up on snacks on sodas, there is plenty of room. I ordered room service twice and was very pleased with the quality of the food. The AC worked well in my room, although it was a little noisy. We walked or took the subway to our destinations. The hotel is two blocks from the Bay Back Station. I have poor feet and it was a fairly easy walk (10 minutes at my slower pace). I was also able to walk to the Boston Park and Charles Street, although these were longer. I found the residents of Boston to be very friendly and helpful. The only cons of our stay were that the wi-fi access, although free, was a very \"low\" signal, which was frustrating when trying to look up Boston things. We were on the 9th floor, and even with the AC going, could occassionally hear road traffic. Also, there were no vending machines, so you had to use the hotel restaurant or room service. We bought some extra sodas and snacks from a nearby 7 Eleven to keep in the fridge. Overall, I would not hesitate to stay here again if I got the same rate as I did last week. Tip: The concierge recommended a great breakfast place within walking distance, \"Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe\".

It is a nice hotel, the rooms are very comfortable, it is quiet and the service is generally good. Our experiences in the restaurant were very good, all the food was good, fairly priced and the service was above average. I guess what sort of tugs at me about this place though is that it seems like in some respects the service is a bit lacking. I like the place, but it feels like they aren't trying all that hard, especially considering the room rates. For example when I arrived I unloaded 6 bags from the car literally 10 feet from the doorman who was standing there on the other side of the sidewalk. There was no one else loading luggage and the doorman was not talking to anyone that I could see, he was just watching traffic go by. Once I got them out of the trunk and give the keys to the valet, wife, 6 yo son and I picked them up and walked past him up the stairs to the checkin desk, with 125 lbs of luggage. No one ever asked if we wanted help with the luggage, not the valet, the doorman or the front desk attendant. I don't mind carrying the luggage, I don't have to tip anyone that way, but it's a strange approach for a place that charges over $350/night. When I checked out the exact same thing happened, I walked past a doorman with 7 bags and no one offered to help me get them either to the curb or into the trunk of the taxi (except the taxi driver). At 7 AM the doorman was there at the entry and never did anything, he said hello, but that's it. I waited several minutes at the curb so there was plenty of opportunity for the doorman to earn a tip, but nothing. Very strange. The hotel was not full when we stayed there, in fact I found out after we checked in that rooms were available during our stay for about 22% less than our reserved rate. So, I was kind of disappointed that I was paying a premium to stay there compared to someone walking in off the street with no reservation, even more so when they put us in a room with a view of an internal courtyard. My sense (I could be wrong) is that the hotel was less than 75% full and yet they put is in a smallish room with no view on a 3 night stay while charging us a relatively high rate. They can do that, but similar to the doorman's lack of helpfulness, it's not going to win them any long term customers. I do appreciate the free wifi, it's fast and consistent, and free - which is what wifi should be in 2009. Location is a subjective thing but I would not recommend the Back Bay area for families with young kids, we have had trouble finding suitable places to eat in this area on our two trips. Lots of nice restaurants that would be great for a night out with your spouse, but not so great for small children.

Although I booked a promotional rate of $175, I was still upgraded to a superior room (apparently a bit larger than standard, with an in-room espresso machine). The hotel, which (until 1997) was the headquarters of the Boston Police Department, has been lovingly renovated. It is beautiful, inside and out. Strangely, the elevator interiors are decorated with a garish prism-like wall covering that reminded me of a disco ball. But all the other space was lovely: modern, but comfortable. Since almost all full-service hotels charge around $15/day for Internet access, it's extremely nice that the Back Bay provides wireless Internet for free (not just in the lobby, but in the guest rooms, as well). It wasn't as speedy as my connection at home, but it was consistent and got the job done. I was initially given an accessible room with an adjustable low-flow shower head. When I saw two peepholes in my door, I realized I had an accessible room and asked to be moved to a different room with a better shower. The hotel staff moved all of my things during the day, and, indeed, the shower was better in the second room (it even had a second shower head for my back!). Like several high-end hotels I've visited, the Back Bay Hotel has a glass shower stall and a separate bathtub. However, this bathtub reminded me of my tub at home (only without a shower). Most hotels with separate tubs have super deep \"soaking tubs\" (at a minimum), sometimes with jets. They missed an opportunity here to provide an additional touch of luxury. My room was turned down every night, including chocolates on the bed and ice in the bucket, and I received two free bottles of water each day. Nice touches.

The room is a decent size, I wouldnt say its huge, but it is in no way small either. The bed is huge and I found it really comfortable. The bathroom is also a good size and the vanity area is great. There were included toiletries as well as robes to use while at the hotel. A problem I had with the robes was that they are extreemely heavy and not good for summer use....but they would be perfect for winter. The shower head had great pressure. Did not use room service so I cannot rate that, but housekeeping did a wonderful job. Each day we went out to sight see and when we returned, no matter what time it was our room was made up.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were quickly checked in and sent to a room on the third floor. We did have a room that faced the inside of the building (meaning that your window faced other rooms within close proximity and the gravel roof was right below you. It would be nice, considering that probably 40% of the rooms face the way that we were facing, if they would do something with the roof, perhaps make a garden, a green area, or a recreation area. The room itself was well appointed with a large LCD TV, a refrigerator hidden in the entertainment center, a nice desk, a closet with a laptop safe and an umbrella for use, and a bathroom with a wonderful shower head and bathrobes to use.

We did frequent the Cuffs Irish Bar and everything was fine in that area. We did not use any other food service at the hotel. We did encounter housekeeping issues during our stay which are completely unacceptable. First, my partner did find someones dirty socks and undergarments on top of the phone book in the one nightstand. Now, this was hidden inside a cabinet and I understand it is not the biggest issue. Secondly, and more importantly, we had a blanket we used for the July 4 fireworks along the Esplanade on Saturday. When we came back on Sunday we hung it over the shower to \"air out\". On Sunday morning, we took it off of the shower and placed it on the floor in the bathroom. That was the only thing on the floor of the bathroom, as we reused our tools and did not place any towels on the bathroom floor. When we came back later on Sunday, we noticed that the blanket was gone. This blanket was a very large queen size blanket. It did not at all have the same texture, color, or style of any of the towels or blankets used at the hotel. We did report it missing. To the credit of the hotel, they have been following up to assist us in finding it; however, I don't believe the same one will be found.

They have an Ifra Red sensor on them so if they detect no movement in the room they turn the AC or heat off. This designed to save money and energy, great idea. Nope theirs a huge caveat in this system, problem is that most folks don't do jumping jacks in their sleep or move around in their sleep so the system shuts down when they sleep so if you set a tempature it won't go there as it the sensor stat shut s down as the device now thinks that you are no longer in the room. Great idea wrong! The guest now will wake up out of sound sleep sweating or freezing depending on the season, you go to thermstat and it turns on again as it detects you. You go back to bed and it shuts off as it does not know you are there. The number 1 thing people want in a hotel room is a good nights sleep and this is impossible with sensor stat as you can't get the room to tempature you want while you sleep. So my opinion is this avoid hotels that have them and call hotels before you book them and ask the system they use, if they use sensor stat book another hotel.

The business centre had two PC's with free internet access and free wireless internet. The downstairs bar was nice and served lovely desserts, which on one night I took up to the room. Very lovely! The restaurant off the bar was expensive, but given it was absolutely freezing and blowing a gale one night we were there, we opted to eat in and chose lovely home-made soup and crusty bread. Try Bangkok Blue next to the Charlesmark Hotel on Boylston for cheap and cheery Thai and the Irish bar MJ O'Connors about a five minute walk from the hotel for good hearty pub grub. Also try a Boston Cream Puff at Mike's Pastry shop on Hanover Street. If you're there in December, I'd highly recommend a visit to the Boston Holiday Pops at Symphony Hall - very Christmassy!

The only problem we had with our room was that it was too hot, but the room did have it's own thermostat which we were able to regulate. The staff were very helpful. The concierge booked our shopping excursion and within five minutes had arranged for the bus to collect us from our hotel despite such short notice. The business suite (a couple of computers with internet access and printer) is free which pleased our kids and was helpful, enabling them to print a map with directions to our next destination.

Taxi from airport took 20 minutes to Jurys. Hotel is ideally suited for shopping, with Filenes and Marshalls just a couple hundred yards away (two large stores competing against one another and offering huge discounts), and within a 20 minutes walk downtown to Macy's, Faneuil Hall, Quincy Food Market and the East and West Markets with their street entertainers. Jurys is a small hotel (220 rooms) compared to some of the other tower block hotels (1000+ rooms) in the Back Bay area, and is extremely personal, with the most friendly, helpful and obliging staff imaginable. Our room on the 9th floor, was spacious with a lovely view of the John Hancock Tower. The room included fridge, aircon, multi channel TV, Espresso Coffee Machine, Safe, King size bed, walk in shower etc. The mattress was the most comfortable I have ever slept on with its quilted top layer. The bar (CUFFS) aptly named, as the building was the former Boston Police Headquarters: is a lively, comfortable, modern meeting place for residents and locals. They serve wonderful bar food at very reasonable prices. The hotel restaurant menu has a wide selection, and I recommend the fillet steak served with pomme puree a la cr\u00c3\u00a8me and crisp onion strings (To Die For!) The deserts are equally as good. Breakfast is a hard choice as there are so many variations to choose from. The Smoked Salmon Benedict was without doubt my favourite, and you have to try the pancakes with fresh berries and maple syrup, all 4 of them! (forget the diet for the weekend!) If you like seafood or lobster, go to the Legal Seafoods Restaurant (if it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fresh, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t legal) on Stuart Street, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to order a bowl of their creamy Clam Chowder!

On the next night after a hard days shopping we decided to try the bar and to go in in two groups to try and speed things up. The food was the worst food I'd ever come acroos. the chips were more than burnt. All 8 of us sent our food back. I asked for mayo and got a little jar that was already used. In fairness to the hotel we spoke with the food manager Shane, who was embarrassed when he seen the food. He offered us drinks and more food to make up. We wouldn't accept so he gave all 8 of us free breakfast the next morning to prove that the hotel could serve good food. Next morning the breakfast was good, with a good variety of foods.

I then called the hotel directly and they quoted a much higher rate, which I questioned based on my research. After I provided the specific websites and rates I was referencing, the hotel graciously honored the lower rate. We arrived on Friday and checked out Sunday. The property is a typical boutique hotel in the business district and is in an excellent location for visitors to Boston. The entrance is a bit awkward. There is a small foyer at the street with a flight of stairs up to the lobby, reception desk and elevators. A flight of stairs down from the same entrance foyer, there is an impressively active, quite noisy bar open to both the entrance and the lobby. Due to this, I requested a quiet location. We were given a corner king-bedded room on the third floor with a back street view. We did not hear any noise from the hotel's bar and it was otherwise quiet except for some late night noise from the street below us (a crowd of men yelling and cheering -maybe a bar on the back street?) and early morning noise from garbage and delivery trucks). I would recommend a higher floor. Our room was attractive, clean and welcoming. It was not overwhelmingly spacious, but did allow for a desk on one side of the room, an armchair and lamp table on the other, and a wall unit with a television compartment, shelving and drawers opposite the foot of the bed. An in-room safe, ironing board/iron and umbrellas were provided. The bed was very comfortable and made up with high quality pressed linens. The bathroom was clean and modern with a walk-in shower (no tub, but this may vary room to room), L'Occitane toiletries, fluffy towels and bathrobes, and a full-sized hairdryer (rather than the travel size usually encountered in hotels). The housekeeping was very good and provided nightly turndown service. There was one odd thing about the hotel d\u00c3\u00a9cor, which was otherwise attractive and tasteful - the lining on the back wall of the elevators is a gaudy, iridescent material that looks more in keeping with a cheap nightclub.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cLove Jurys Hotel! #1 in Boston!\u201d", "Author": "rokeedy", "ReviewID": "UR20089910", "Content": "I can't say enough about how great this hotel is!

This was not one of the normal 'over the counter' excursions but still they did everything they could to help (and we had a great day on the Vineyard as a result).

It is obviously a popular place as there were locals in the bar every night, although it was never too crowded. We were made to feel welcome by the locals too, which was an added extra. The rooms were large and clean. Having stayed in a number of 5 star hotels - I can say the bathroom is the largest one I have seen - and the towels were changed twice daily! The location of the hotel in Boston is excellent, with everything being in walking distance if you are fairly mobile.

I find this a bit strange as I used to play for a rugby team in Ireland who would have stayed in Jury's hotels when we travelled to away games, and although the hotels were always pleasant there was never anything exceptional about them. Jury's Boston has obviously set out with the goal of bringing Irish hospitality to the States but has managed to actually outshine the original. We arrived at 10am Sunday morning after an overnight flight from Vegas and were pleasantly surprised that they had a room available for us straight away. The check in staff arranged to have our bags brought up the room, but when there was on one available after 5 minutes the check in staff brought them up themselves. Our room was comfortable if unspectacular, The bathroom was a bit small, but having previously been the home of Boston Police the building clearly wasn't a blank canvas for Jury's to work with. Two free bottles of water were left in the empty minibar along with a note to say that if we were coming to stay again we could email ahead to advise what drinks and snacks we would like to have placed in the fridge ahead of our arrival. After a quick sleep we ventured downstairs to cuffs bar for an 'Irish breakfast' which was one of the best I have ever had. From here it was a short walk to the Prudential Centre for a Duck Tour. Unfortunately the heavens opened 30 minutes into our tour and we wished we had brought the umbrella that the hotel had left in our room for just such an occasion. On each night of our stay we had drinks in the Cuffs bar and found it to be a welcoming and relaxing end to a long day of sightseeing. We also had dinner in the Stanhope grill, which was of a very high standard. There are several nice restaurants within walking distance of the hotel; Fleming's was one which we particularly enjoyed. The hotel has a small gym, but no pool which is one negative point, however the computer room with complimentary access to the internet and printing is a nice touch that more hotels should offer My wife and I both really enjoyed our stay in Jury's. We don't normally visit Irish bars when we are in the US or try to find a home from home when we're away, but we booked Jury's because we got a good deal and seemed to have a pretty much spotless record from TA reviewers. We weren't disappointed with our choice and every aspect of our stay was filled with thoughtful touches from the hotel from the free internet to the suitcase air freshener left on our bed on the day of departure.

A Hertz rental car facility was only a couple blocks away near the Park Plaza Hotel. In short, a wonderful base from which to explore the Boston area.

Some free tourist stuff for you: Fort Independance (South Boston),open at weekends only and easy to reach by T and bus #9. Historic fort with great tours, pleasant beach and views of harbour. USS Constitution is also free to visit and easy to get to. If you have a week saver T ticket it is also valid for the boat trip from Long Wharf to Charlestown Navy Yard at no cost. A great way to arrive. This is easily combined with a climb up the Bunker Hill Monument. My husband highly recommends the Samuel Adams Brewery Tour (few dollars donation requested).

It's located in the former police headquarters which fits well into the mixtures of older and newer architecture in the downtown area. Our room the first night was a regular king room and although not huge it was extremely well appointed with all the conveniences. The furniture was deep cherry in color including the bathroom vanity. The bathroom had tile and marble. The color scheeme was green, gold and tan which is perfect since this is supposed to be an \"Irish\" Hotel. The linens were frette and gorgeously high thread count. The duvet and sham covers were luxurious and I only wish I could have them at my home. I loved that they had always replenished complimentary bottles of drinking water in the inroom fridge and 24 hour room service for snacks, meals and all types of beverages. The front desk personnel were fast, efficient, and mostly Irish. The head concierge was tremendously accomodating when I could finally get a hold of him and helped with dinner reservations and a private driving tour of the city. HIs restaurant suggestions met our needs exactly and we were trememndously impressed by the reccommendations. Housekeeping did a tremendous job and the same housekeeper tends to the same block of rooms day after day which I found refreshing, so I knew my tips were going directly to the person responsible for the upkeep. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel. The bar was accessible and quite a hot spot in the evening. The lounge/bathrooms even offer cloth hand towels for drying ones hands with l'occitane soap and lotion. This hotel doesn't msis much in terms of lavishly serving their clientele. The door men and valets remembered us by name. When we returned for 4 nights at the end of our East Coast holiday we were given a corner room with a view which was more spacious, though the smaller room was almost more charming.

It was a very nice hotel, and we didn't have any problems, but I must say that I am surprised that it is ranked the #1 hotel in Boston. that is not a complaint about the hotel, rather I would think that surely there are nicer hotels out there. The hotel is very nicely decorated, very contemporary and centrally located. It was clean and the service was very good. The concierge, Heather, was particularly helpful in recommending and booking dinner reservations. We ate breakfast in the dining room each morning and the food was very good. They have a nice breakfast buffet that I think was around $18 per person, comparable to any large hotel. The bar attracts a lively crowd, especially after work, and there is a nice outdoor terrace for when the weather is nice. Be sure to visit the bar area to see the police memorabilia (the hotel is a renovated police HQ); very interesting! Where the hotel lacks is in basic amenities...there is no coffee maker, no complimentary newspaper, no pool, no gift shop. It wasn't a huge deal to us, but one of the reasons I was surprised the hotel is in the #1 spot. The rooms are on the small side, and though we received turndown service each night, we found it amusing that they left a single chocolate each night, despite the fact that there were clearly 2 people staying in the room. We also thought that the bed was uncomfortable. When we first arrived, we loved it...you sink right in. Same with the pillows. However, sleeping on it is a different story...our backs were killing us because the mattresses are so soft. So, if you prefer a firmer mattress, this is NOT the hotel for you! Just a matter of preference. Here is another tip...the hotel charges $39 a day for parking, which I think is pretty standard among Boston Hotels. However, we did notice towards the end of our stay that there is a parking garage approximately a block past the hotel on Stuart Street that charges $12 for all day parking. It might be something worth looking into! Having said all that, we would consider staying at the Jury's on future visits.

I'm sure I could have called housekeeping and they would have brought some. Finally, the decor of the lobby was a little bit off. The hotel has a mostly traditional-to-contemporary feel, so I am not sure why the designer thought it would be a good idea to throw in some neon lights under the stairs and weird disco panels on the walls of the wood-paneled elevators.

The hotel is ideally placed a short walk away from most things you want to see. Anything you are not sure about - then have a chat with any of the concierges - nothing seems too much trouble. Our room - a corner king executive - was large, bright and airy. Beds were very comfortable - and each night - as one would expect in a hotel of this standard - the sheets were turned down and the obligatory chocolates left on the pillow - still a nice touch though. I hired the coffee maker for the week and I am glad i did. Each day the tray was replenished witha selection of coffees and tea, and fresh milk and cream left in the fridge together with water bottles. I would recommend that anyone staying here hire the coffee makers - its $27 dollars for the week or \u00c2\u00a314 . I dont see what the fuss about hiring them is - I have never stayed anywhere in America except smaller backwood places where there has been any kind of brewing facility in the room , and certainly never seen one in any city hotels. We had the feeling whilst we were there that everyone genuinely wanted us to be there and we were made very welcome . We will certainly go back should we ever return to Boston . For me its a no brainer to stay anywhere else. This is a very good hotel with a laid back cosy atmosphere - not like many hotels of this standard which can be a bit stuffy and staid. Places we ate at and thought OK Joes - Hamburgers and american fare Laurel Grill - next to hotel - good food and very reasonable California Pizza - OK for quick meals Changs Chinese Bistro - reasonable standards , good value. Rock Bottom Beer Company - American - OK - cheap ! Maggianos Little Italy - Excellent - cheap ! All the above are in easy walking distance of the hotel and whilst they are probably not in the good food guide to Boston a la this forum - they will stand muster with most eating establishments for good reasonably priced meals - buts its all a matter of choice and opinion.

Our room with two double beds was first class, not too small as some reviews have said. Three adults stayed comforably, though we admittedly packed light. Free internet service was both wired and wireless, and easy to connect to. The beds were comfortable, and the bedding was changed as requested prior to our arrival (due to a down feather allergy). The hotel allowed us to check in early (which they do not guarantee but will try to accomodate). The bathroom was large, with nice modern decor. It featured a large, walk-in shower with dual shower heads. One of my few minor nit-picks was that water leaked out at the base of the door and soaked the bath mat (not a deal breaker). The room included a lockable safe, mini-bar, iron, hair dryer, robe and umbrella for your use. The hotel has a nice restaurant (The Stanhope) and bar (Cuffs). We had a drink at the bar and watched sports on the big screen TVs. We had breakfast at the Stanhope the next morning. It was of the usual \"big hotel\" price ($7-18), but I have to say I did not regret the price-convenience trade off because it was EXCELLENT. The location was VERY easy to find by car, right off the Mass. Pike Prudential Center exit. It is close to Copley Square, Newberry Street and Boston Common. My wife recently stayed at the Four Seasons in Boston, and although she liked it, said it had nothing over the Jurys (which was ~$200 less per night).

We used the nearby T station to get around, but when we returned to the airport, we simply asked the concierge to organize a taxi for us. Cuffs Irish bar on the ground floor was very reasonably priced \u00e2\u20ac\u201c similar prices to outside of the hotel and comparable to UK prices. The staff again were very friendly and helpful. Food was served very quickly and was standard pub fayre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you are looking for anything other than traditional American fries etc then this is probably not the best place to eat, although they do recommend some really good restaurants close by \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the concierge can make reservations for you. One in particular was Davio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just one block away and a really good break from fries and burgers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we can highly recommend the tagliatelle Bolognese.

Before tax, each night averaged Cdn $200, a great price given what the hotel has to offer. The location is fantastic. Situated in the Back Bay, it's about a 5min walk to several subway stations (Back Bay, Copley, Arlington) on both the Green and Yellow lines -- giving you a choice of starting points depending on where your destination is. The hotel is about 3 short blocks to Copley Square where the beautiful Trinity Church and Public Library are found. It's also just a 5-10min walk to a number of other destinations -- including the Prudential Centre, Newbury St. (great for shopping and late night dining), and the Public Garden. Anywhere you can't walk is an easy 10-15min subway ride away. The room was very clean, relatively spacious, and warmly modern. It featured a wide entry area, with a large double-door closet and oversized full-length mirror. The comfortable king bed was flanked on one side by a bedstand, and on the other by a large desk. This work area would be great for business travellers (with a rolling office chair, and free high speed access). One corner of the room had a side table and chair for reading. The TV was housed in a large wooden wall unit with lots of drawer space, a CD stereo (CDs can be loaned from the concierge), and a small fridge, great for storing drinks and snacks -- and which they stock with 2 complimentary bottles of water each day. The large marble-tiled bathroom featured a granite-topped wood vanity with lots of counter space, plus an additional glass shelf under the mirror for overflow. The tub was fairly small, but clean. Toiletries were Aveda, the towel-rack held oversized bath towels and was heated (didn't seem to do much for the towels, but a nice touch!). Other amenities included: Large in-room safe, ironing board and steam iron, bathrobes, umbrella for rainy days, two clock radios on either side of the bed, and a full-sized hair dryer. For turndown service, staff fill your ice bucket, leave chocolate on the pillow, and turn the stereo on to classical music. The room was very quiet, never once did I hear any hallway noise. The downstairs sitting areas were very comfortable and in the mornings you can grab breakfast treats and coffee at the \"Barista Cafe\". As others have noted, the lobby bar is very busy, but wasn't a problem where we were staying (9th floor). We easily checked our bags for a few hours on the last day, before setting out for Back Bay station to take the subway to the airport (40 mins door to door -- at $1.25 an economical option if you're looking to save on cabs!).

I can happily confirm the positive commentary previously posted and add some of our own. Location is ideal.

Getting to the hotel is easy by car. It has about the easiest access to/from I-90 that you could ask, and they have valet parking (about $36 with unlimited in/out). Service is excellent and friendly. Jean at the front door was helpful and very enthusiastic about the city. The same goes for Keith at the concierge desk, who pointed us to several excellent restaurants in the North End & Cambridge. Turn-down and room service were prompt, professional and friendly. The room was most notable for its bathroom. We had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe King\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. The room itself wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly large, but the bathroom was quite big (nice separate shower & bath tub). The bed was too comfortable, causing us to sleep through our morning agendas. We did not have much of a view at all (some rooms likely have beautiful views given the location). The bar/restaurant were hopping while we were there; great if you want to join but the noise was somehow contained so that we were only as aware of it as we wanted to be. We saw several couples with young children and thought the hotel was just fine for families. We had breakfast in the room one morning; it was as good as any other room service breakfast we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had. The gym was a small room with limited equipment. The wireless signal was strong and worked perfectly all weekend.

In between booking and travelling Jury's went to number 1 on Tripadvisor...so I was looking forward(even more)to my first trip to Boston. I was not disappointed. The rooms are well furnished, (mine was not large but perfectly adequate for our 3 day stay. I worked out if you turn left from the lift (elevator) then chances are you will have one of the larger rooms, I did see one when the maid was cleaning, if you want one try asking for a twin, instead of a double), and are decorated in relaxing colours. The bathroom had a shower and bath and was well stocked with Aveda products. The staff are extremley polite, friendly and helpful, a warm welcome awaits all guests. As for the facilities, there is a small gym, 2 lounges next to the lobby, a basement bar and restaurant. the bar can be noisy, but that is just because the sound echo's a little, you don't hear it when you are away from the entrance stairs nor does it seem that noisy when you are in it. It is well worth having a beer or two after a long days shopping or pre dinner. Dinner, the one downfall is the restuarant, don't use it even for breakfast. My wife and I did have one meal, we were too tired to start looking for somewhare else, so decided to give it a try. My food was tasteless (monk fish was watery and had no flavour at all, my vegetable starter I knew it was based on tomatoes and mushrooms because that as the shape and colour of the food, but where was the taste? nowhere, probably left in the kitchen.) Breakfast even though we were down early (around 7:30) the buffet breakfast was stale and overcooked. There are many many places to eat go somewhere else. We did not stay at Jury's because of the restaurant so it did not detract from our overall experience. I would highly recommend Jury's, the location is perfect for Boston Common, Beacon Hill, Copley Square and Downtown, all are no more than a 10 min walk.

It's great. My girlfriend and I stayed there this past weekend when visiting Boston for a romantic getaway of shopping, sightseeing, etc. We were thrilled. She stays at some of the best of the best hotels, the Ritz e.g., all over the country with her big shot job and she thought that the Jurys Boston was the nicest hotel she's stayed at so far. While planning the getaway, I got to know Jurys Boston's friendly and courteous staff while I made arrangements for our big weekend. They were always the most helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. We stayed in an Executive Corner King on the 6th Floor--Room 638 to be exact. We were met at the door by the valet who promptly help us unload and took care of the car. The Valet and garage fee was an extra $36, which is competitive for Boston parking. We went through the impressive lobby and had our room keys in less than five minutes. We entered our room and I immediately noticed that it was filled with welcoming light from three large windows. Also, I noticed that the vase of long stem roses I had arranged with the concierge the night before was waiting on the table and filling the room with fragrance. The stereo tape/CD player was also set to softly playing classical music. The bathroom was finished completely in natural stone and marble with a walk-in shower and a large spacious bath. There were fluffy white towels and pristine white robes waiting for us. There is also a large closet off the bath with a safe. There was a king size bed that was absolutely clean and perfect, and the room just set the perfect mood for the trip. The true test of a hotel is the bed. So many top hotels have terrible beds that are old and moldy. Not Jurys. I was so impressed with this bed that I wrote down the name of the mattress manufacturer, size and style and I plan to order one of my own. My girlfriend, the world traveller, was equally impressed. She says she usually wakes up from a hotel stay with a backache. The bed was so nice that, unfortunately, we missed a few hours of sightseeing because we just stayed in the bed wrapped up in the hotel bathrobes (I also wrote down the manufacturer's name of the robes). Fortunately, we didn't miss much sightseeing in the end because outside it was freezing outside anyway. You wouldn't know it because this is no drafty old money hotel like others I've been in Boston. It was so warm and cozy in the room that I just assumed that the blue sky meant a gorgeous warm day outside. The insulated windows weren't cold, so how would I have known? Well, at other hotels, I would have known because of cold windowsills, drafts and condensation on the windows. The concierge was also helpful in getting us around. We got breakfast at a place the concierge recommended and it was excellent as well. I've been to many hotels where the concierge really didn't know much about the area at all. A good concierge can make a huge difference in the success of your trip and Jurys's concierge was certainly friendly and reliable. I only wish we'd had time to stay for two or more nights. We didn't even get to eat at the restaurant on the premises or spend much time at Cuff's Irish Pub downstairs. On Saturday night, it was packed! It's clearly a popular place, and well decorated. The waterfall staircase and open fireplaces are elegant. In contrast, the hotel lobby was cozy and inviting. If you need to do work, this is a good lobby. It's not one of those giant echo-filled lobbies where one can get easily distracted. The lobby at the Jurys Boston is again well-lighted, and well furnished with sound-absorbant materials. There were many people this Sunday just sitting on the big comfy sofas reading the complementary Boston Globes. Had I had the time, I certainly would have joined them. In short, we loved the Jurys Boston. Even though I'm curious about staying at other hotels when we come back to Boston, I'll be hard pressed to risk a stay somewhere else that might not measure up. Jurys was the cleanest, friendliest, classiest and highest quality hotel experience I've ever had and I couldn't recommend it more. Lastly, I only picked it because it was rated #1 on this site.

We were traveling with our one year old daughter, something I would not really recommend since the rooms are so small and the common areas less than kid-friendly. While the decor of the hotel is very nice, in my opinion the random details that I assume are meant to be \"hip\" look out of place and just weird. For example, the glittery stuff on the back wall of the elevator -- what's up with that? Also, the stairs from the bar to the front desk area that change color every few minutes are just ugly. I guess these are a continuation of the happening bar downstairs that adjoin them. We very much enjoyed the food we had from the hotel -- a delicious room service breakfast and a lunch in the bar was tasty, too. I did find it odd that the bar was the only place for lunch, though. Being the trendy place that it is, it wasn't really a cozy place for lunch on a wet Saturday, particularly with a kid in tow. Also, I searched high and low for a cup of tea on Sat. afternoon (it is an Irish hotel after all!) and was told the bar, again, was the only option. The staff was very friendly. We received a great breakfast recommendation -- Charlie's, a Mom and Pop greasy spoon diner with very good food in the South End, about a 10 minute walk away.

The day before our visit, I realized I had forgotten exactly where we had made our reservations, and called Jury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as I remembered that they were one of the hotels that came most highly recommended by trip advisor reviews. Our recollection was that they had been booked for the dates we needed and had recommended another boutique hotel in the area. I spoke with a gentleman named Dan, who I later learned was the Deputy General Manager. To my great surprise, he offered to call around to other hotels on my behalf to find out where we had our reservation. Clearly, there was no benefit to him to provide this service, as he believed we were not staying at his hotel. After spending an hour calling around to other hotels, he called to inform me that we were actually booked at Jury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. We both had a well-deserved laugh. Once we arrived, the royal treatment continued. The hotel is absolutely lovely and extremely hip. Carefully selected paintings and sculptures abound.

My husband and I were staying without the kiddies for the weekend, because we were heading up to Lahey Clinic on Tuesday and decided to have a couple nights to ourselves. So, after reading the reviews for Jurys and Nine Zero we picked Jurys. I guess I wish that we had tried the Nine Zero. Our first room was on the 10th floor, one of only 3 rooms, so it would be quiet, which was great. However, the bedspread and pillows had numerous stains on them, the toilet in the bathroom had the seat unattached, and the TV did not work right. The volume on the TV is capped, which is not a problem, but it is when one speaker out of two total speakers is not working. No problem, we called down to see if we could move, as we were planning on catching up on our movies via PayPerView while we were away. We were relocated to a room on the 5th floor. It was not noisy and was a pretty good size. The pros and cons of the hotel are as follows: PROS: 1) Good location. 2) Nice Aveda Products in the bathroom 3) Fabulous dual head shower and towel warmer!! 4) Nice and accomodating staff, really superb. 5) GREAT breakfast room service, try the blueberry pancakes. 6) Refridgerator in room that is empty so you can stock it. CONS: 1) Very expensive room service, as expected, but atrocious dinner food. 2) No stores to buy snacks or sodas within close walking distance. 3) Room not the cleanest...dust on furniture, stains on carpets. All in all, not bad, but for $250+ a night, I would expect the hotel to be in a little better condition. Little things that were annoying were we only had one bathrobe, the \"warm\" cookies from room service were good, but not warm, parking was $36 a DAY, not easy in/out either - a good 15 to 20 minute wait each time. All the other reviews were very positive so maybe it was just us. However, this is what happened during our stay.

The Receptionist offered us a room straight away, even though we were not supposed to check in until 3.00pm. Its these extras that make a major difference between this Hotel and its competitors. We stayed in the Commonwealth Hotel in Boston also (see my other review) but Jurys Hotel was vastly superior. The decor was great. There is a cool water feature when you come in the front door. There is a lounge also on the first floor beside another bar. There is an excellent restaurant and Bar on the ground floor. Breakfast was also nice too. The staff were no problem when we ordered food in the bar one evening at 11.30pm. This Hotel has a great buzz about it at night with young people/couples using the bars. An open patio type area backs out just below street level from the bar and is filled every evening with people chatting and having a few drinks. The Hotel also seems popular for conferences etc. Its sitauated well too, its just a two minute stroll to Copley Square. The T Station is a three minute walk away. The Hard Rock Cafe is a block away. Also close is McCormick & Schmick. They do a $1.95 menu between 4-6pm and this fills a hole if you are hungry. The housekeeping staff were excellent. The Rooms were turned every evening and there was complementary drinking water in the fridge, which was welcomed after coming back from a long days sight-seeing. The door staff were also excellent. It was no problem for them to advise where to eat, drink etc. Hailing a cab was also no bother for them.

We went for 2 rooms for our family with 3 kids and we had 2 rooms at the end of a hall across from each other. The plus for us (& I'm sure our neighbors) was that there was an additional door that cordoned off our end of the hallway which made our space more like a suite. I noticed that each floor had 2 sets of these so it's worth requesting for a family. It was sure a plus! Our rates were quite reasonable for a downtown city hotel too.

We ordered room service in the morning and the people were unbelievably friendly and prompt. The service here was great all around. I'll only mention a couple of things-- first, the bar that greets you when entering the hotel does detract from a relaxed atmosphere (although you leave it all behind when up in your room) and the valet parking is expensive, although not unusual for Boston-- just something to keep in mind when budgeting for your stay. I think it was $36 for one night. All in all, if we didn't live five miles away, we would definitely stay here again. The special feeling of our wedding day was enhanced by our night at Jurys.

We arrived in Boston at 9:00 am and fully expected to check into the hotel but have to wait until noon or later to actually get into our room. Not so at Jury's! The receptionist had a room ready for occupancy and called for the bellhop. Within a matter of minutes, we were handed our door cards and led to the elevator for the beginning of our weekend. Once we entered our room, we were once again pleasantly surprised by the relaxing contemporary decor, absurdly plush bed (which I will get to in a moment), and huge bathroom with a full size walk-in shower! The shower has double shower heads for those hard to reach places. Shortly after, the bellhop delivered our luggage, gave us a tour of the room and all of the amenities in it. Explained the layout of the hotel and suggested that if we needed any further service to call the front desk and ask for Keith. I know that this is probably more of the routine learned at the initial training but his demeanor and pleasant smile made me feel like this was going to be a wonderful weekend. Once we were situated in the room, I took a minute to relax and test out the 'absurdly plush bed' I spoke of earlier. Let me give you a brief description of what that means. The bed was a standard king, long in width and short in length. The bed was covered with 2 decorative pillows, 4 rather large feather down pillows, an overstuffed comforter and underneath that was a feather down blanket. The mattress was pillow top and very, very thick. All in all, the assembled bed reminded me more of a colorful cloud than an actual bed. Needless to say, I had the best rest in a very long time in that bed. The only drawback is that the room was a little small. But you should expect that if you are going to stay in a hotel that was renovated from a very old police station. In the end, it really doesn't matter that much. Who goes on a trip to relax in a room? Lastly, after exiting the hotel, we come to location. With all of the outstanding things listed above about Jury's, there is the issue of location that keeps me from rating it a 5. The location isn't bad at all, in fact it is in the charming South End. You are only minutes from Copley Square and Newbury Street (SHOPPING!) or Boston Common for a relaxing day in the park. Unfortunately, it is located a good 20 minute or more walk from the famed Faneuil Hall and Hanover Street in the North End. You will probably use some type of vehicular transportation for the more famous sites like Fenway Park, Harvard, and Boston Harbor. Although that could be said for about any hotel in the central area. Depending on where you stay determines where you can walk to and where you will have to ride to. One last note more for Jury's than anything. You should change the 3-D holographic design in your elevators. It's so big and so out of place with the rest of the European design.", "Date": "June 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, OK", "Title": "\u201cThe Jury is in\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3516017", "Content": "Loved this hotel.

The result of this incomprehensible design decision is that guests are greeted by a phenomenally loud wave of general cacophony from the 75+ people gathered there each time you leave/enter the hotel from early evening onwards. It was not clear if this room is for guests only or if the hotel hires the room out for private use. Perhaps the above would not become issues in a $40 a-night hotel, but somewhere that charges upwards of $185 per night should not be having any of these problems. Better attention should have been paid to the details that affect guests (such as the ones listed above) and not on niceties such as the entrance statue, mesmerising lift walls, a sand-blasted staircase or a cascading water feature, nice as they all are but add nothing to a guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfort or benefit. In my view, the hotel should not charge more than $80 a night until the above are all resolved.
