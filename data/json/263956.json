Reception was friendly. I had booked on Orbitz (\"the death star\"). On negatives observed, the walls can seem a bit thin if you're next to the room that sleeps 4 and they're in a talkative mood. Location is a big plus, as it's walkable from Centraal Station in about 10 minutes as long as you're not too heavy on bags. This makes it good for overnight layovers, as the round-trip from Schiphol is only 8 to 9 euros and the trip takes maybe 25 minutes, with frequent service. I needed to get back to the airport by 8 a.m. the next day and had no problem. It's also in a party area of town, judging by the nature of the businesses nearby. You need only cross the street for the nearest coffee shop, for example. Porn, mushrooms, raunchy souvenirs and space cakes also seem to be well-represented though, to be fair, it quiets down at night and doesn't have the pedestrian visitor traffic (nor the windows) like the red light district does. So maybe it's party-lite, OK for those seeking such, tolerable for other adult visitors seeking a convenient location, but unsuitable for families.

The building itself is beautiful, very clean throughout. as far as i know, most of the rooms have huge open windows looking out on the main street at the front or the lovely dutch houses out back which is where we were, our window view was amazing, it looked out over the rooftops of all the other buildings and cathedrals etc. The room was tidy, we got a twin budget, it was clean and fresh. there were a few burn marks in the sheet that had been cut out to make the sheet look a little tidier. When we checked in we were told no smoking in the room which was a bit gutting but understandable. The bin was emptied during the morning sometime but we were out, the towels were not but i was to understand that you were to take them to reception and ask for a new one. haarlemmerstraat is the most beautiful place ever! it is by far my favourite area in amsterdam, it is tranquil and civilised, there aren't so many bars so the noise stays at a decant level, the canals around here are really quiet and pretty. If you are going to amsterdam for a first time or are still exploring this city then you must stay in haarlemmerstraat. All in all i think this hotel is a great place to stay, it is cheap, friendly, in a great area and acts as a great base camp to explore this wonderful city, as for the missing bags, i'm sorry but only a fool would leave baggage with someone regardless if it was with a hotel, police, coffee shop or a drug addict, the point is keep your bags with you and this mistake wont happen, we did and everything was fine.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the price we paid !!\u201d", "Author": "lfod_cork", "ReviewID": "UR115845653", "Content": "Myself and 7 of my friends stayed here in late July,,,,, and I must say we were rather nervous having read the reviews below!!!

We found the rooms to be very basic but fine for the money. Beds soft but comfortable, rooms generally tidy but damp on the ceiling and cigarette burns on the sheets. My room in particular was quite noisy as it looked onto the road but I didn't have any trouble sleeping (probably because of the booze...). The bathrooms were pretty big and shower was nice and hot. Towels weren't replaced when we put them on the floor so I nicked them from the towel cupboard! Free Wifi but couldn't get it to work. The location was good, 5 min walk from the station, but a bit of a walk to the Dam Sq, Red Light, Liedsplein. Breakfast immediately around the hotel was pretty rubbish but if you turn left and walk over the bridge (quite a walk) there is a really nice deli / cafe on the right hand side opposite the supermarket. It's pretty cheap too. As mentioned in the title we had problems with our luggage which put a dampener on the hotel as a whole really. We arrived stupidly early for our hotel at 10am and couldn't check in until 2pm. The hotel said they had a luggage store though so we agreed to put our stuff there. It turned out it was through an unlocked door, down a dingy stairway into a horrible little room with a couple of backpacks in there already and a door marked staff only. (suggesting staff pass through there all the time). Alarm bells rang (we had been assured repeatedly nothing was ever stolen from there) but we left our stuff there. Well you can guess the rest. We came back and our bags had been opened and searched and my friends lost an ebook reader and an iPod. Yes it was our own fault for leaving valuables in there. Other groups had cases in there that had been gone through too. The attitude of the staff after the event was of shock which quickly turned to \"well we said dont leave valuables\" to \"theres nothing we can do\". When we asked them to call the police they were quite hesitant. Eventually they did but told us we had to go to the police station to make a statement and marked a place down by leidseplein ( a looong way away). We travelled down there but couldn't find the place, everyone told us the police station was up by the rail station (much closer to the hotel). Bit weird we were sent all the way down to leidseplein. In the end we found one in the Red Light district and managed to make a statement and get a crime number for insurance purposes. It certainly did spoil our opinion of what would have been a good value stay for the weekend.

Ive been to the dam many times over the last 10 years and experienced many different hotels, B&B's and guest houses. For me Quentin Arrive was the worsed by far. We new the Hotel was only 1 star but we just wanted somewhere cheap to stay that was close to Central station. The location was good but the service from the staff at Quentin arrive was very poor. When we made the booking through Laterooms.com we were not told that the hotel would take a Pre-authorization payment from my card 6 days before travel. The hotel took half of the overall cost from my card incase we didnt show. On checking in at the hotel we were asked for FULL payment of our stay. I queried this at reception explaining that they had already taken half the cost of the room 6 days previously. The grumpy receptionist went on to tell me this was a Pre-authorization payment and that it would be refunded to my card straight away. As i had all my money in Euro's and only had the other half of the cost of the stay on my card left one of my friends had to make full payment on his card on my behalf. Then after checking inn we asked what time breakfast was served the next morning. We were told that the hotel did not serve breakfast. We showed them our Laterooms.com Hotel booking confirmation which included breakfast for which we had paid extra for and the receptionist simply shrugged her shoulders and told us to come back later and talk about it then. At this point we were feeling confused, let down and wondering what on earth was going on. We were made to pay an extra 50% for the room and told the breakfast we had payed for did not exist. After complaining we were told they would honour our breakfast and the next morning we were again dissapointed to find a very basic continetal breakfast of longlife milk, bread, slice of ham, slice of cheese. We had to complain there was no butter and we were told they could not toast our bread either. Shocking! On the morning of checking out of the hotel i realised that the Pre-authorization had not yet been refunded to my card. After speaking with the Hotel Mangeress 'Mona' i was told that i had to ring my own Bank and ask them to stop the payment myself. I telehoned both my own bank & visa who explained to me this was not possible and only after the hotel had refunded my Pre-authorization payment would the money return to my bank account. I even asked my bank to explain this to 'Mona' on the phone for which they did. 'Mona' kept on blaming my bank and said that her Visa company had refunded my card. They had not! After a week of being back at home i have had to make several calls to both Laterooms.com, Quentin Arrive, Visa & my bank. All at a cost to me. Visa have told me that the Pre-authorization is pending and until they either refund or collect this money then there is nothing i can do about this. Both Visa and my Bank say that the Pre-authorization can be pending for up to 6 weeks. What a disgraceful way for a Hotel to treat its customers. The whole scenario has spoilt the trip.

My husband and I still can't get over how terrible our experience was. We booked our hotel on the advice of freinds who had stayed in the triple room upstairs only some few months prior. We booked online and paid the most for this room than any other room we had booked in Europe (over 12 different hotels). This one was the most expensive, and the most disgusting! When we arrived, the hotel was under construction, so we had to enter through a side door into a makeshift reception area. Once we checked in, we went up to our room. We had a double room with a private bathroom -- you opened the door to the room, and there were a set of stairs, making the room just above the makeshift reception area -- beside the stairs leading to the rest of the hotel. Rather than a double bed, we had 2 twins pushed together. Although not what we had paid for and not what was on our booking sheet, it was alright. However, the sheets were stained and smelled horrible. The room was tiny -- barely able to maneouver around the two beds. The noise was incredible -- so loud -- at all hours of the day and night (partly because we were directly above the reception area). The washroom in our room was the worst part of the entire hotel. To this day, the thought of it makes me want to vomit. It smelled so strongly of mold and the shower curtain was almost black. I could not shower without holding my breath. It was absolutely horrible. The toilet smelled like sewage, and there were bugs EVERYWHERE in the bathroom -- looked like fleas. When you flushed the toilet, even more bugs came out. It was absolutely horrible. So disgusting. The hotel, however, was a short walking distance from the central train station. It was in a convenient location to walk all around Amsterdam, but a bit sketchy at night, as it is a little bit out of the central area and on a poorly lit street (especially using the side entrance during construction). I would NEVER stay in this dump again, nor would I recommend it to anyone -- not even my worst enemy. The hotel had no internet access, no restaurant, no cafe, nothing.

We were pleased when we saw the reception area as it was pretty cosy and looked quite plush in terms of what we were expecting. The reception staff were OK if a bit dim, when I asked the lady at the counter of this was the 'quentin arrive' hotel she looked confused and said 'no.....oh wait, yes' (after looking at my confirmation) then took ages to process it whilst quietly arguing with herself. We also didn't mind the steep winding staircase to get to our room on the second floor - my partner won't go in a lift anyway. That's about as good as it got. The room was an average size but quite grotty, the floor was completely uneven I dread to think what we may have found under the carpet but it felt un-secure and bumpy. The bed was fine, cover had a couple of marks on it so I slept without it - fortunately it was warn enough to do so. The pillowcases were clean but the pillows inside were discoloured, from smoke I imagine. We've paid much less and got en suit everywhere else we stayed so weren't too pleased to realise that it was shared toilet/shower facilities but suppose we should have checked what we were booking. The toilet was OK at best but in the evenings it was accompanied with sick, roll up ash and suspect smells. The shower room was dank and smelt of mould but the actual shower itself was fine except the door handle came off in my hand. The door handle for our room was rubbish we feel lucky we weren't robbed. It was quite an effort and took some skill to actually look the door and when locked it didn't not feel secure in the slightest. Also the doors were all quite heavy and slammed which was noisy when you have people going back and forth to go to the toilet. In the morning we were awoken by a loud discussion by 2 staff about cleaning the toilets - least they were cleaned I suppose. Whilst I didn't see or hear any mice like other guests I did see the aftermath. I left a bag of cereal bars on the floor and at first thought I'd damaged them by putting a bag or something on top of them ripping the bag and wrapping, causing crumbs all over the floor. Of course when all the crumbs disappeared & I found lots of other holes in wrappers yet pieces of wrappers remained all over the floor this left little to the imagination. Yes the hotel is indeed infested with mice, even on the second floor.

We moved the bed over a touch so that we could open the window wide and to our disgust found toenails on the already filthy carpet.

The hotel itself was very easy to find and the female member of staff who booked us in was very friendly and helpful, her male counterpart wasn't quite such a joy to deal with and seemed to get annoyed by even the simplest query! We had three rooms between us, 2 triples and a double. The triple I stayed in was exactly as the \"accomodation\" page of the hotels website shows. Three single beds, a sink, a TV and not much else. The windows were huge and the room was bright and would be quite nice if they spent a bit of money on paint and carpet. The beds were grotty and the carpets and furniture were in dire need of attention. The room was served by a communal shower and toilet that were both pretty grimey. The room itself was fairly insecure and it was a lengthy process just to get the door locked!! There are no safe facilities in the room and the reception offered no similar service either. There was an interesting array of stains around the room which I imagine was supposed to be \"decor\" but became an interesting conversation piece anyway. The other triple, on the 2nd floor I believe, had bunk beds and a single and was small and dingy with little light or air. The double wasn't as bad and had a small rickety balcony which only Evil Knievil would dare to climb out onto. The hotel is well situated and is a short jaunt from the central rail station if you can avoid the psychotic cyclists that will make every effort to mow down anyone with a suitcase! While I don't paint a horrifically bad picture of the place that's probably because I only spent 12 hours in the actual hotel during our stay and the time I was there was spent asleep. This is by far the scabbiest hotel I've ever stayed in, but it's also by far the cheapest. It's certainly in hostel territory rather than hotel. I would not recommend that lone travellers stay there as the rooms are so insecure and I doubt the staff would be very sympathetic/helpful if you got robbed. In summary the Quentin Arrive is a flea-pit of a hostel but the overwhelming factor is that they are very cheap and conveniently located. This combination clearly works as they are consistently well booked, I doubt many of those booking are repeat visitors though. If you are going to Amsterdam to enjoy the nightlife and won't be spending long in the room, don't mind showering in a grubby shower with no locks on the door and you have good travel insurance then your search for a hotel is over.

After a bit of a struggle finding the place (due to our stupidity rather than it being hard to find) I was surprised by the room. One good thing about all these negative reviews is that they make it hard for the place to be below your expectations. The room was clean, on-suite (wasn't expecting that) very light and even had a balcony with inclusive beer (left behind by previous guests). The central heating worked great for a winter stay, the room was always cosy. TV in the room with music channels including lots of dutch hip hop (interesting). It's in a great location walking distance from loads of great coffee shops and easy access to trams and centraal station. Only downside would be the steep stairs, but you get use to this pretty quickly.
