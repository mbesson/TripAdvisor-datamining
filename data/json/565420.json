{"Reviews": [{"Content": "I Would Not Stay Here Again! The Grand Central Hotel, at 2-2 Tsukasa-cho, Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, is not a good business hotel, as advertised. The rooms are very small and the room floor was dirty when I arrived and was not cleaned the entire three days I stayed there. The overall appearance of the hotel was less than what I desired. The staff was not as friendly as I had experienced in other Tokyo hotels but the hotel did remain intact during the earthquake on the morning of April 11, while I was still in bed. However, the adjoining Casa Vino restaurant had just what I needed every morning - a 500 Yen Western style breakfast!
