The room itself was wonderful! There was a nice sitting area, kitchen, balcony, and even a washer and dryer (although difficult to use). The design of the hallway entrances to the rooms is odd. There is one door in the hallway which leads to a foyer area shared by two rooms. I think this helps to cut down on hallway noise, however when there is a shared area like that and the people in the other room are loud, it is amplified within that space. There is a huge parking problem at this resort and with the new expansion it will become even more troublesome. The parking lot is small and when it's full, people park along the street. It is a major inconvenience to park in the street and have a long walk back to your room, especially if you have luggage. At least they do not charge for parking. The resort is located in an industrial park. It's definitely not the location I expected based on the resort website. However once you are there, the beauty of the place takes over and you forget about the strange location. This is a time share resort and they will try to entice you to listen to their talk. I received a phone call before leaving on our trip to try and get me to sign up for their talk and was approached again at the concierge desk. I politely answered that I wasn't interested and they respected that each time. I did not feel pressured. We did not utilize the pool/hot tub area due to outdoor temperatures in the 50's. We ate at the lobby bar one night as well as the Siena restaurant on location. Please see separate review for this.

I normally don\u2019t have problems. I was very disappointed with the management of this place. Our rate varied from $200 on Sunday night to $300 on Friday and Saturday night. Not bad in season in Napa. Unfortunately you are in industrial park a ways from Napa. The A/C is extremely loud. This I could live with. My true problem is the management philosophy. The first morning we had no hot water. I called the front desk to let them know. They told me I was not the only one and they could not insure me it would be fixed. Second morning no hot water, called the desk they told me I was not only one and may not be fixed by the next morning. They said they would get some information and me call right back. I waited around, never received a call back. On the way out I bumped into a guy in the elevator who told me he had changed rooms because he had no hot water. That evening when we returned to the hotel I called and spoke to manager and explained everything. He tried to convince me this was the first they new of the problem, and that I was the only one with an issue and he would get it fixed. All hotels log complaints, he new much better then I did they have a problem with their hot water system. They sent a guy up, who was very nice and realized this was just game. They finally admitted they could not fix it. The manager never admitted they have problems with their hot water system that appears to be ongoing. They finally moved us to a room with hot water. When I say my problem is with the management, when you travel you will have a problem from time to time that is unavoidable. Your problem may be something other then hot water but how the management responds to the problem will be consistent. The fact that they feel its fine to charge me $300 a night for a room with no (not a little not warm) hot water is criminal. There are industry standards for items like this. They failed to make any effort to mitigate our inconvenience. I guess I could have went there and begged for some money off, but if that what it takes they can keep it. I should have had the credit card company stop payment but we booked through Orbits so that would be a pain.

Got a great rate on Priceline for this property but I didn't know what to expect. The reviews sounded very positive though and they were right. This is a great spot; romantic and relaxing. The hotel is part of a time share and there appears to be a variety of room sizes - ours had small kitchen, couch, washer and dryer, large bathroom with soaking tub and comfortable bed. The pillows were NOT comfortable however - two were too large and two others were small and soft. That messed up sleep a bit. Room was quiet but that is probably because there were not many people staying in that section. I heard housekeeping staff in the room next door when we arrived and they were a bit loud. No problems though, quiet all night. We enjoyed a couples massage at the Terra Spa. Spa was spacious, well appointed, and so relaxing, we were the last clients of the day and it was perfect way to unwind. Had dinner in the restaurant - we shared lamb chops, short ribs and a lot more food than we should have - and it was all excellent. Cocktails and wine suggestions were also spot on. Better pillows, a nicer view and some attention to detail in the rooms (some dings in the paint in spots) would have moved this stay into the Excellent category. However, we will likely stay here again when we have the chance, because even though it is not IN the town of Napa ( it is actually located amongst groups of office complexes, the Vino Bello provides comfortable room options, a great spa, a wine tasting cave (closed by the time we got done with massages) and a terrific restaurant.

The best things about the Vino Bello is an on-site bar, on-site tastings, a jacuzzi, BBQs, a kiddie pool and water play area, vineyards on the property, a restaurant on the property, AND a spa. We like to go into towns and explore, but I could see how you literally could have everything you need there, especially if you've had enough tastings for the day and just need to chill out without driving. Also, if you're there with family/kids, it would make it really easy to sneak away and do the spa or a wine tasting without cutting out the kids for long. Just really convenient and a nice place. Also, even the studios have a kitchenette with microwave, sink, and whatever you need. No stove in the studios, but there is a toaster oven that you can use to cook some things in. Also, the bathtub was large and could actually fit those that don't usually fit! Not too far from downtown Napa. Not right in the heart of the wineries, but not a terrible location either.

Not because we though we'd have a bad experience but didn't want to miss out on being \"in\" Napa and missing all the action. We couldn't have been happier with the location of this property or with the property itself! The property is near an office park (clean and quiet) but we really wouldn't have even known unless we were coming or going as you couldn't see it from most rooms. The check in was smooth and the staff was delightful. The doorman never failed to say hello when he opened the doors for those coming and going and the receptionist was cheerful and helpful. Our room was a 1 bedroom condo (room 2315) and the layout and amenities were worth the upgrade. A large spa tub was in the bedroom and a huge walk in multi jetted shower was in the bathroom. The entire condo had granite counter tops and mostly tile floors except the living room with fireplace. We used the kitchen every morning to make breakfast and it was equipped with everything we needed. We especially enjoyed sipping wine on the huge porch overlooking the pool and on-site vineyard Trinitas. Some reviewers complained about noise but we never had an issue-we were on the top floor in the Chardonnay building and it was peaceful except a night with some pool revelers that stayed up late. The property as a whole is beautifully maintained. Gorgeous roses and lavender growing everywhere leaving the air fragrant. There was ambient music playing softly from speakers throughout the property. There were fire pits to warm your hands and sit next to in a few places as well. We visited the wine tasting room in the cave cellar Trinitas and enjoyed their wines and even joined their wine club as it was very reasonable and had surprisingly good wines for the price. We only had two nitpicks during our stay. When we checked in there were ants we had to have someone come and treat the room. I will say we mentioned it to housekeeping on the way out the door for the day and we forgot the camera and literally as we came off the elevator to run back in and grab it they were already in the room spraying! The other nitpick was the jetted tub in our room. There was a residue that built up in the foam (not every time we used it strangely) that was unappealing and left us unsure about using it. Because of this I cannot give VB a perfect rating but wish there was a 4.5 option..lol.

What could beat having a message from the front desk telling you the merlot grapes were being harvested that day if we wanted to watch? And so we opened our curtains and there it was. Vino Bello also provides a shuttle bus into Napa to keep wine tasters safe. A nice feature. The location was off the highway and seemed to pop up from nowhere, but since our suite faced the vineyard and the giant sculpture of \"The Crusher,\" we had no complaints with that. The kitchen was well appointed and everything worked. Outdoor grills were available to those who wanted to cook. The bathroom was luxurious, with a separate spa tub between the bedroom and the shower and toilet part of the bathroom. It was a nice extravagance. The outdoor pool provided a place to rest between wine tours and wonderful meals.

This made the price of our stay a bit high for a two-day stay but we were generally happy with our stay at the Vino Bello. We stayed in the Chardonnay building, which overlooked the pool and a hillside vineyard just beyond the pool. Our suite offered efficient central heating/air conditioning, a washer and dryer, full-equipped kitchen with complimentary coffee, bottled water and bottle of Muscato from the Trinitas winery. There was one spacious bathroom with an excellent shower with five separate heads (nice!). The living room furniture was very comfortable and the TV channel selection was standard and sufficient. The sofa pullout bed was not terribly comfortable, probably best for younger children, less suitable for older adults and not advisable for the elderly. The master bedroom included a very comfortable bed, and medium soft pillows that felt to be feathered. There was a television, plenty of space and a safe large enough to hold my laptop, large camera, extra digital camera and paperwork. There was also a patio that overlooked the pool and hillside that included four iron cushioned chairs as well as a two seat bench of similar make. This was nice for a morning coffee and afternoon wine after a day of wine touring in Napa. The Hotel restaurant called Siena Restaurant was also very good. We had two very nice breakfasts there twice and evening room service \u2013 ordering two hamburgers and a cheese ($14.00), pepperoni and Italian sausage pizza ($13.50) and two chocolate deserts \u2013 can\u2019t recall the price. Everything that came from Siena was very good to excellent, easily recommendable, making it a decent idea just to eat at the Vino Bello instead of going into Napa centre to find good food. Lastly, the service of the hotel was superb. We had a quick check-in and check-out experience and the concierge helped highlight the Napa region, suggest wineries based on our wine preferences and called in our afternoon tasting reservation to Del Dotto as well.

I was not expecting to be THIS diasppointed by this one. This was supposed to be my leisure time after my buisness in sacramento. I wanted to pamper myself in what appeared to be a very nice 4 star hotel. I had nowhere to go, I just wanted to relax and enjoy the sights and spa. The pool and spa are quite beautiful. The spa is actually in the cellar, which is a nice touch. The landscaping is very pretty and it is quite enjoyable to walk in the vineyard. But wow, the room was horrible. It is pretty yes... but that is it. Ist was sooo incredibly noisy. I was woken up at 6h00 by the kids in the other room and the cabinet doors in their kitchenne that just echoed in my room. And at night, untill 11h00 it was the TV. The disposition of the rooms make it so that the kitchennettes are on the other rooms wall. And the TV is on the counter, also on the other person's room wall. Usually in high priced hotels (like the hilton where I had a relly really nice stay), the kitchen is on the corridor wall and the TV on an inner wall or an ouside wall to minimise the noise. I had a terrible time and even cut my trip short because of the paper thin walls. It was HORRIBLE. I just couldn't get my basic sleep, and I am on VACATION, in a luxurious hotel... Unacceptable. I had a room on the third floor on my second night after I complained about the noise in my first room the first night (and a free breakfast---which would have been fine if my noise problem had been solved, but it was not. The same thing happened). It seems all rooms are built the same and all poorly insulated. They were kind enough to change my room to one on the top floor, but it was the EXACT same thing. I could hear everything in the other room: their TV, I could even tell which games they were playing with their kids (Simon says, 50 questions)... and they were not screaming, and I was watching TV or in my bed. I could hear them walk---even on the top floor, and the doors of the kitchenettes every time they closed, as they are directly on the other rooms wall, which makes little sence. Even the comfort inn where I stayed many times as a student has better insulation, and it is a budget hotel. The noise kept going till 11h30 and started again in both rooms around 6h00. I just wanted to sleep till 8h00am and I couldn't even do that. I tried to sleep with my earplugs, but I could still hear the loud bangs of the doors and the kitchen cabinets. This is unacceptable for a hotel of this class. UNACCEPTABLE. I stayed 2 nights and left for the third. I could not stand staying one more night. Also there were a lot of minor mishaps with the room itself: We didn't have a clock-radio, and there was no fan over the mini-oven so the hole room smelled. The little fridge in the first room wasn't even bolted to the counter and kept tipping forward. There were no doors in the lower cabinet where the trash cans were. and no pressure in the shower. AND no vanity to put our things because of the pedestal sink, so we had to put them on the side of the tub. Real fancy. This was the first room. The second was fine except the lack of a fan. There should NOT be so much difference amongst rooms of the same category. First room unacceptable for a luxuary hotel, the other was fine. Customer satisfaction should be important to any hotel. Because I complained the very first night and left after the second because of the same situation, any self respecting hotel would reimburse my hole stay. But as I checked-out and complained again, the hotel says it's in the hands of expedia and expedia in the hands of the hotel... and I am in hell. And now after 4 attempts to reach the unreachable manager during the rest of my vacation ---which took about 2h30 of my time---, expedia tells me the Vino BEllo will only reimburse for the night I didn't use, which was a given... but they really don't seem to care about the quality of my stay, after all I did get a free breakfast and a change of rooms. What am I complaining about. So what if I was constantly hearing my neighbours, so what if I couldn't sleep... This would not have been even a question at most hotels and they would have reimbursed me. Afterall, I paid for a luxury hotel and got only 2 star quality (in my room of couse). Usually, hotels have a satisfaction guarantee, but apparently here they do not.

I let it go thinking it was an accident and that she was in a hurry to serve others.

They are located in an office park, yes. We had a GPS which was very helpful in finding the hotel. However, it is about 5-7 minutes from DT Napa or 5-7 minutes to the Carneros Wine area. (Artesa, beautiful beautiful!) On Sunday morning, 10 AM and it took about 10 minutes to Jessup Cellars in Yountville. That place was amazing. The grounds at the Meritage it's sister resort are very nice. The Vino Bello grounds are nice, but not as nice. The roses were beautiful there however, and it is a quick walk over to the Meritage, which we did one night to have a night cap in the bar. Our room was nicely furnished, microwave, frig, coffee pot. dishes, various wine stems, etc. Great large tub and shower area. We did use the washer and dryer, and they supplied laundry detergent 2 days in a row. The dryer was a bit tricky to use but it worked fine. We got this hotel through priceline at $139 a night. They do charge a $15 resort fee on top of that once you check in. Each day the supply bottled waters and pepsis (we live in atlanta... I have not drank a pepsi in years.. oh well) We also got a welcome bottle of wine. The wine was actually better than I thought it would be. My husband had called ahead, and they were more than nice to his requests for my birthday celebration. We had a wine tasting in the cave at the resort, which was a laid back, nice experience. Walked into the spa area, but did not do anything there as far as extra services. The concierge , Pam, totally hooked us up with wine tour ideas and discounts. She also gave us some restaurant suggestions. She wanted us to do the time share 90 minute deal, but we did not do that. There could have been more nice perks if we had sat there for 90 minutes, but our time was more precious. The only negative comment is that they need to focus on some of the little things, as an example, in the area by the restaurant, on a table out in the hallway, someone had written (only a kid would have gotten on the floor to do this) their name in the dust on the bottom area of the table. The top of the table had beautiful flowers on it.. but the bottom had some kids name. In our building there was duct tape in our elevator going up to the room. Yes, it matched the metal, and it did not really stand out, but whats with duct tape. We picked this hotel for the price, and location, as we wanted to focus our time and money on the wineries we visited.

Further, because Vino Bello is a resort, they try to keep their guest on premises and charge a nominal ($15) resort fee -- which was not mentioned in the Hotwire promotion. Our biggest disappointment was the quality of the rooms. The rooms themselves are unusually shaped. They are fairly long rooms, but very narrow -- giving me a claustrophobic feeling.

Reasons I gave it 4 instead of 5: the room had a hairdryer that was literally spitting sparks and we had to call 2 or 3 times before they finally replaced it. Also, we did not consistently get our towels replaced (for example, 1 day we were only given 4 clean towels, no washcloths or hand towels...the next day we got hand towels, still not washcloths even though we'd called and asked for some). Also, the room does come w/ a mini clothes washer and dryer, which is nice, but the despite following the instructions on how to run them, they took quite a bit of fiddling with to get them to run, and they were very loud (sounded like a jet engine taking off).

Not what we had expected. But, really, that's all they can fit into this very small room. They had messed up our reservation by not noting that we requested a room with a king-size bed. So, we ended up with two full-size beds - and the staff were absolutely unhelpful and made promises to move us the next day, but never followed through on their promises. The room is so cramped with two beds that there was no place to sit. How would a timeshare owner possibly stay there for a week? I have no idea where they would sit to read the newspaper or eat a meal. The washing machine in our room dripped very loudly and woke us - and kept us up - for several hours in the middle of the night. The location is quite a drive from most of the wineries - it takes about 10-15 minutes to get to the concentrated winery area. That was an additional drawback. Finally, the rate we paid through Priceline was not a deal - anyone could've gotten the same rate by booking at the Vino Bello site and pre-paying. And then they would've been treated a lot better by the staff. They pretty much dismissed us - having booked through Priceline.

The rooms were furnished in the luxury meets comfort style de jour (i.e. granite counters tops, big garden tub, big wood furniture, nice appliances etc). We received a complimentary bottle of wine plus two complimentary bottles of water in the room, the latter of which is necessary after consuming the former. There was no parking fee and ample parking. There is a $15. resort fee, which gives you access to the Meritage pool etc. I only stayed one night, but am guessing the $15 fee is a nightly one. Include this in your budget. In my limited stay, I made it to the Hess winery and the in-house wine tasting room. This hotel is not in the heart of the Napa town square. So if that is the experience you want, this is not your hotel. If you are going to do a day of wine tastings from Vino Bello, you might want to hire a tour company that drives you from winery to winery. I am sure the concierge could provide assistance.

So, we had a cold waterfall coming out of the ceiling on us in the shower. The pull-out was stained with who knows what -- it took some convincing for my daughters to sleep on it -- ugh! Then at about midnight, monkeys moved in upstairs. So, by the morning we requested a new room, unfortunately it took the better part of the day to get the move done. Once we relocated the stay was better, but it took up half of our two-day stay. Ironically, they were concerned about getting the maids in to clean our old room -- why would the have any new guest move in without fixing the air??? The rooms are really beautiful and I would bet a stay on the top floor would be absolutely a pleasure, but the lower floors are not the best.

Also, the air conditioning was not working well the second night of our stay. At one point I tried to call both the concierge and front desk and the phone just rang and rang with no answer. Finally got an operator. Parking was a problem at night. Had to park very far away from our building. Also, there is construction underway that we were not aware of beforehand. It was not going on over the weekend. There is a nice pool area for families with a kiddie pool and water feature area for them. Our toddler enjoyed that a lot. We arrived around 3:00 the first day and was told by the concierge that there was a restaurant in the hotel, but we found it to be closed until 5:30. Had to eat in the bar with our toddler. Food was good though. The concierge for the Vino Bello was there on Saturday when we checked in but informed us she was leaving for the rest of the weekend and we could use the one in the adjoining resort.

The location of the resort is perfect, just off the highway and 4 to 5 miles from downtown Napa. You have to visit the downtown area - Allegria - Restaurant was the best. I mean the very best. The food and service was top notch - went there on our first day of arrival - 20th and then we had to celebration our departure with a great meal. Some of the other gotta try restaurants (sorry can't think of the names of them but you have to go and eat there) are right in that little square near the vistors information center, another one that stands out is Piccolini ( good - decent). Also go by the um... riverfront right off of First street near the courthouse and Napa Inn B&B a few other good eats and a delicious sweet shop. Don't go to Buttercreme Bakery! It was a waste of our time and money. Not one of our personal favs - have and MUCH MUCH better and the staff wasn't very friendly. Back to the resort for a minute: The staff at the Mertiage is great - people friendly and the bar area is perfect with great evening entertainment. I am not a wine drinker but my husband drinks socially. We visited some very nice wineries - the most memorable being in St. Helena just about a 30 minute ride from the resort. Our two favorites were The White Hall and Prager ( actually met the owners). They are just off the main highway down the road from each other. Prager was very interesting because the tasting and wineries are in the backyard or basment of the owners summer home? Busy they are but very accommodating. Heading back to the resort is a restaurant called The Mustard. Fine to California Casual dining. nice prices and the food looked very good but the wait was 25 minutes and we had, had too much to sip so we needed food ASAP (LOL). I mean a day full of sipping can take its toll. Anyway, back at the resort there is a sufficient fitness center to meet your cardo needs and the pool and jaguzzi was great. This resort doesn't have a restaurant on site so you share with the Mertiage which is maybe 20 steps away. The food was always excellent.

When I got there, it was beautiful and people were nice, but the experience was a little soured because of the phone service. The hotel was still very new at that point and they were working out kinks. This time around, there was not one shortcoming. The rooms are BEAUTIFUL! The kitchen has everything you could hope for. The bathrooms are amazing. The living rooms are cozy. The dining table is homey and inviting and the bed is beyond comfortable. The little things- plenty of storage space, good lighting, an easy outlet in which to plug in the iron near an easy place to set the iron up- add up to be a big coup for this establishment. I could go on and on about the amenities, but, as wonderful as they are, the hotel's true strength is in their service. Everyone was accommodating. When the shower invitation list exploded the week before the shower, they helped me find the space for everyone, at no additional cost to me.

If you've never stayed at The Carneros Inn, and want the ultimate relaxation and top-rated guest experience and can afford the over $350 per night price tag, then please skip past the Vino Bello Resort and head over on Hwy. 121 to The Carneros Inn. You won't be disappointed. My wife can usually only afford two nights at The Carneros Inn and always spend a couple of nights testing out other resorts. For us, the experience at Vino Bello was just ok. Vino Bello gave us a room in their Chardonnay building which happens to be their Shell vacation ownership rooms. The toaster over was broken, their was a large stain on the carpet, most likely wine, and the toilet paper holder was broken. The couple next door to us on the 3rd floor had their TV on and we could hear every word of what they were watching. I had to turn our TV on to drown out the noise. Another worry is that the ice machine is located on the first floor outside of the secure entrance. It is in a back service corridor which is a bit odd place to put it for your guests to find. Also, we don't have kids, however I would feel uneasy sending my child to get ice when you have to go outside of the hotel building and the door lock behind you. Also there was cigarette butts at the base of the ice machine which tells possibly the employees are using this area as a smoking lounge. Be careful when asking the concierge in the main check-in building for a list of nearby restaurants, they don't have one, which is very odd, however they will start to recommend many in the Napa valley which they partner and use the list to sell you into joining them for a 90 minute presentation for selling their Shell Vacation Resort ownership to you. All in all, we will continue to search for other resorts and always get that wonderful feeling when we head down the road to The Carneros Inn for a couple of incredible days and nights of bliss. Please check out their website if you don't believe me. www.thecarnerosinn.com. By the way, this year they added two Audi A8 cars to their cottage resort and they use them to shuttle their guests around the property.

There was no dresser for clothes only some small drawers in the kitchen area. Our kitchen sink was broken, the faucet was just laying there. We didn't need to use it or we would have called. We were only staying 2 nights. Every day we had 2 complimentary bottles of water and two sodas plus a bottle of wine on the first day. That was a very nice touch. The grounds at the resort were manicured and well taken care of. The hotel lobby and dining areas were very pretty. We did not eat at the hotel.

I would say that this is where it ended for me, as we pulled up we noticed cars along the road far away from the resort, after we checked in I asked about where to park and was told \"where ever you can\", we had to park about a 3 min walk away from the resort IN THE RAIN because there was NO parking anywhere in the parking lot.. we even left for dinner and came back and tryed again and still no parking.. I didnt understand this because the resort didnt seem to have many people around, just ALOT of cars.. this was VERY disappointing and happened right off the bat.. another major disappointment was that this stay was for our anniversary and I had put in the comments when I made reservations on line that I really wanted a bottle of champagne to be in the room when we arrived, I also put in there to call me if there were any problems with this request and never heard from them.. so i called a day or two before the stay to make sure this was possible and the girl I talked to assured me this was no problem and it was in the notes on the reservations.. we arrived an hour AFTER check in time and when we got to the room there was no champagne.. MAJOR disappointment especially after all the effort on my part for such a simple request.. The fire place in our room didnt work right at all, you turn it on and it stays on for about 5 min, shuts off and re lights with a loud boom ever 5 min for about 20 min then just shuts off.. from there we went to turn on the tv in the main room and found that the batteries in the remote were dead.. room service was fast and reliable but I was a little un happy when you are charged a 18% service fee on the total of the order and are expected to give a tip, so really the items you buy are about 35-40% more that listed, I dont feel that this is fare, but its just my opinion.. and after we ate we left the dishes on the counter for one night and woke to ants all over the kitchen... I really dont mean to bash this place I just thought that for the money you shouldnt have to deal with these things.. the Rooms are VERY NICE!

It's funny reading other reviews...there is just no satisfying some people! Our overall experience was great; we thought the room was fabulous (we had a suite)-perfect for anyone planning to stay more than a few days (full refrigerator, full kitchen, living room, laundry, etc.). The decorating was tasteful and \"homey\" and there was plenty of space to unwind. I'd say that the only room which was \"tight\" was the bedroom, but only so because of the dresser (which is VERY nice to have, as I tend to like to unpack, no matter HOW long we're staying!) took up some of the space. We took advantage of booking our stay online directly from the Shell Vacations site and received a $75 \"resort credit\" for doing so. This credit can be applied towards the spa and/or the restaurant, Siena, located in the Meritage. On the second night of our stay we decided to take advantage of the restaurant so we could use our credit. We opted to sit outside next to the really warm propane fire pit! I would agree with what some others have said about the restaurant...the food was very good, however, we waited EXTREMELY long for our meals (close to 40 minutes!). Fortunately we did each have a glass of wine to enjoy while we waited, which the restaurant/server kindly \"treated\" us to for our patience. We probably would have tried dessert, but were concerned about how long it would have taken (at that point it was close to 10:00 p.m.) I would also agree that the wine list was somewhat pricey, and frustrating that Siena was charging MORE for the same wines which they serve in their cave/tasting room! The pool was gorgeous, although we didn't find much time to enjoy it. Another disappointment was the fact that the jacuzzi was out of service during our stay (we could have walked over to the Meritage but the jacuzzi was a popular place there!), and I very much enjoy unwinding in the jacuzzi after a long day of tasting. Oh well. I also took advantage of the fitness center during our stay. Although small, it was probably adequately sized for the size of the resort. When I was there, there were 3 other people working out (they had 2 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, and 2 bicycles) and we were all very comfortable. (It did get HOT in there...not sure if we could have turned up the air or something...) I typically run outside when I'm at home, but, since the resort is located within a corporate park, it wasn't a terribly scenic place for a run. Through talking to some locals at the wineries, we understand that there are plans for many more wineries within the vicinity of Vino Bello, which would be great. We didn't mind the drive into downtown Napa, it was a very quick ride and not an inconvenience at all (we had a rental car). The noise: no complaints. Perhaps the air conditioner was a little loud when it kicked on and you were watching TV, but I'm only remembering that now since reading other reviews (i.e. it didn't bother me while we were there). The only other time we heard people moving about was in the morning as everyone was going up/downstairs and heading to that day's destinations. Again, no problem. We would stay here again, and I think it's fabulous that, upon return home from our stay, we received an email from the resort encouraging us to post our reviews.

I had a few other hotels in mind but after looking thru the guest photos Bello Vino really caught my eye. Even though there were a number of bad reviews I decided to book it and just hope for the best. Let me tell you, we got the best! I had planned to go on the wine train in the morning but had nothing planned for the evening and was somewhat worried. We arrived to the hotel before the 4pm check in and were told they would try to get us our room early, but we did end up waiting until the 4pm check in time, and ended up not getting the room location we had reserved. That was the only negative aspect of our stay, and in reality it didnt bother us that much, especially once we got to our room. While in the lobby everyone was very attentive and willing to help with anything. That was quite a suprise to me because compared to the other guests we were rather young (25 and 21). While we waited for our room to be ready we walked the premesis and fell in love. The pool areas at the Meritage and Bello Vino are absolutely beautiful. The hill behind the resort with the day spa and wine tasting room were incredible as well. When we opened the door to our room my girlfriend almost fell on the ground. It was beautifully furnished and had everything you could ever want, the kitchen was fully stocked with plates, bowls, utensils, pots, pans, EVERYTHING! The bed was huge and luxurious, the hot tub was the highlight, and although a little on the small side for 2 people, we still spent a few hours in it. The bathroom was massive and lavish, they didnt skimp on anything. Although I had nothing planned for that night, we realized we werent going to do anything! We sat in the room and took advantage of all the luxuries and ordered pizza! Looking back on all the bad reviews makes me want to slap those people in the face! The room was not loud, that you had to check in at the meritage wasnt a problem in the slightest... unless you are crippled or a total douche bag. No matter where you go in Napa the view really isnt that great anyways, and if you get a view facing the pool and the mini vinyard behind the resort the view is beautiful.

What is fantastic is that it also has a kitchen sink, cabinets full of all the things you might need like ceramic dishes, wine glasses, cups, silverware, etc. It also has a microwave and toaster oven and fridge. All of this came in SO handy and you don't have to do the dishes! The maid service takes care of all of that. The fridge comes stocked with a bottle of white wine, two bottles of water and a few cans of soda. These are all included in your price of the resort and not extra charges, so enjoy. The bed was soft. It was called a king, but to me it seemed smaller than that. I think someone much over 6' tall might find it a bit short. The pillows could have been softer. The airconditioner woked quite well, but it was rather loud. The second night, we opened the sliding door and closed the screen on the slider. it created a great sleeping temp in the room (with no noise from the AC). The linens on the bed were quality with a light down comforter. The bathroom was very nice with an oversized oval tub. The tub is a bit high though. Anyone with hip problems or guests that are elderly might find it very difficult to get in and out of the tub/shower. There are two pools available, one at the vino bella and another at the sister resort next door, the Meritage. They are both very nice pools, but i liked the one at the meritage better. It was a little more \"resorty\". The one at the Vino Bella has 2 nice BBQs though, so really you can't go wrong with either one. The pools close at 10pm because they are right outside the guest rooms. each night staff had to run off stragglers though. :) My husband and i also had spa treatments at the Terra Spa.

The couples tub soak was the most romantic experience i have ever had in my life.....gorgeous room with a two person raised jacuzzi tub surrounded with decorative tile....lit only with candlelight.

Upon obtaining the name of the hotel I went to their website and was informed that the hotel is under construction. I am taking this up with Priceline, since they should not refer people to hotels with construction without FIRST informing them. I called three times to the hotel and they could not find my reservation. They finally called me at 6pm on the arrival day and told me that they found it. I was told over the telephone that I could bring my 13 year old daughter to the spa. We went early that morning and I was told that no children are allowed. The air conditioning in the room was like an airplane taking off every 10 minutes. This occurred all night long!!. We were able to hear the loud family upstairs until 1am and again in the morning. They had a child who ran back and forth throwing himself/herself on the floor. Big Booms. The maintenance at this hotel is horrible; the bathroom vent is clogged with dust hanging from it. We even had the room service man listen to the A/c and he jumped back when the a/c made the noise while he was delivering the breakfast. I contacted the Asst. Manager in the morning and asked him to come to witness the situation; however, he told me that he would speak to the Manager during the week about giving me a night stay in the future. I called and left messages for him for 2 weeks and got no response. I spoke to another Manager who told me that he would check into it and get back to me, but never did. I finally called the general manager and was told that these issues do not warrant an offer other than crediting me for $19 room service charge! He said that they can't do anything about the noise from other rooms and they might have had a repair man come to the room to service the air conditioning in the middle of the night. This is a hotel room, can you imagine a repairman working on your air conditioning unit in your room while you are in your PJ's in the middle of the night and having all of the dust from opening the unit on top of your Bed!! I told him that being in the Residential Property Management Business that I am aware that most places do not even have maintenance personnel on duty during the night and only respond to sprinkler and fire emergencies. My husband does this work and I am a property Manager. The Gen Mgr. agreed to this statement, but didn't comment as to why his Assistant Manager didn\u2019t even come to the room in the morning to review the a/c situation and the noise from the other room. I paid almost $300 for a 4 Star Hotel in a horrible location and this is what they offer. After researching this hotel, I see that this hotel is all over San Francisco as a Time Share Offer. Get 2 nights at VINO BELLA for a cheap rate to view their timeshare. I have been to numerous four star hotels across this country and this is the WORST and management does nothing about your complaint. After being persistent the Gen Mgr offered me a $75 discount to come back during a week night. My rate would be $150 plus tax to spend another night at a resort??? offering horrible customer service, horrible accommodations and has severe maintenance issues. You can stay at the FAIRMONT hotel in Napa for another $50 and be at a RESORT with Great Services and Great Management OR any other four star hotel which will be more than worth the money. I will never again stay at Vino Bello (See other bad reviews of this hotel/resort online!

On the other hand, if you're a fan of high pressured timeshare sales and noise-passive walls then boy are you in for a treat!

The walls are so paper-thin that you hear the footsteps above and the bedroom olympics from the room adjacent to yours (and vice-versa). Even though the property lists within the city limits of Napa, it's actually 3 miles south of Downtown Napa in a business park. There is nothing romantic or Napa-esque about the location. In fact, you're actually between American Canyon and Napa Proper. Their concierge is actually their first point of attack for their timeshare sales. The 90 minute presentation quickly became 180... one no-pressure sales person became three high-pressure sales people. In hindsight, I'd forego the $100 wine dollars and keep my 3 hours of time. They also tell you that you'll get free wine tastings from a list of wineries. Many of them didn't even recognize the voucher. My last complaint is an unauthorized \"resort fee\" charge on my credit card. I booked with Priceline and it was supposed to be all inclusive. The resort manager, Robert, later admitted it was an issue that was supposed to be worked out between Vino Bello and Priceline (but had failed to do so when I was a guest). He made no attempt to credit the charge. In fact, upon check-in and check-out there was no mention of this charge. Talk about being sneaky... and this coming from a supposed 4 star resort?! The $30 charge wouldn't be as big of a deal if they were up front about it, but they weren't. It was their fault in not clarifying who would be responsible for the charges with Priceline. They shouldn't hold their guests accountable for their contract negotiation shortcomings. On the plus side, it is a new resort. It is very clean and the common area for The Meritage Resort (their sister property) is very inviting. The rooms are large and the kitchenettes are well-stocked with many dining amenities. The furniture in the rooms are sturdy and quite comfortable. There's also a washer and dryer in each room which is a nice bonus. If you're able to get the room for ~$150 to $200 on Priceline and are a heavy sleeper, then I say go for it. Otherwise, I'd pay a little more and stay at another property.

The hotel did weird things like run their sprinkler system at 10:00pm. We would walk over to the bar to have a drink and would have to dodge the sprinkler systems on the way back. If you want to go for a late night swim or jacuzzi forget it, they close at 10:00pm. The hotel bartenders need to brush up on their mixing skills as well.

Room looked exactly as it does on-line. Location is the very south end of Napa, a bit of a drive, but that is OK. We were very happy with the accomodations, except for the lack of hot water. It took a long time for the running water to heat up, Ok for the shower (such a waste of water though, esp considering the drought in California), but made it very challenging to wash dishes (we had the condo with the full kitchen). Housekeeping was great, room was very clean every day and they ran the dishwasher for us when we were gone. The place was very well stocked. We were very satisfied with the accomodations. We were very disappointed in the service on 2 occassions. 1st, we were expecting an overnight UPS package, we notified the Front Desk twice to let them know to expect it. Per their own policy, it should be delivered to our room w/in 1/2 hr of their receipt. At the time of our 2nd call, the resort had already signed for the package (we didn't know at the time). At the end of the day, when we returned to our room, no package. We called and told them it had been signed for (looked it up ourselves on the UPS website). They then discovered that the sales office signed for it, didn't notify anyone of its arrival and it is sitting on someone's desk and we have to wait until morning to get it. I thought this was unacceptable and that they didn't even try to remedy the situation. Long story short, I went personally to the front desk, told them about my disappointment, apparently, they did have the key and they were able to access the package and we got it that night. I don't think a guest should have to walk down there to ask this as they obviously didn't even try the first time. Someone paid good money to have a package overnighted to a guest (the package was clearly addressed with our guest room #) and someone just decides to let it sit and not deliver it?? 2nd issue, we called the concierge to find out where the nearest urgent care or emergency room was, we thought we were going to need it for our son. We ended up just leaving our vacation a day early instead to go to our local doctor, but we never heard back from ANYONE regarding our question. If a guest is asking about an emergency room, don't you think someone should return that call? Even if it isn't until the next day just to see if there is anything they could do to help.

I would say only book at VB if the room type (layout, number of beds) is not important to you. A large family in town for a family reunion was checking in at the same time as us. They had specifically booked rooms at VB because they wanted kitchenettes for cooking and needed sofa beds for the kids. Like us, Meritage said that all rooms at VB were booked and needed to put them at Meritage, but Meritage was a disaster for their situation and number of guests; fitting everyone into the Meritage space was really problematic for them. They had called several times prior to arrival to make sure that they had suites at VB and still didn\u2019t get what they had reserved.

However, we booked this the night before we got there on priceline. We ended up getting it for $85 before taxes and their \"resort fee\". The resort fee covers the cost of the bottle of wine they put in the room, soda, and water. We were only there 1 night but helped ourselves to all the water, soda, and wine, so it seemed fair for the 20 dollars. The room was very nice. How we got this one for $85 surprised me, but hey - we took it! This wasn't a suite, but it also wasn't a standard room. It had a nice deep tub, mini fridge, microwave, sink, toaster oven, balcony, washer, dryer, and VERY comfortable king bed. They also had a dvd library which we took advantage of. The decor was traditional tuscanny style and was very tasteful. The concierge was very helpful, as was the front desk. The concierge showed us stuff to do and gave us some great info/savings brochures. The grounds were nice. I took advantage of the 24 hour work out room. The pools were heated and there were bbq's outside of each building. Our room had dishes and utensils, so it seems like a great stay for a family in one of the jr. suites or suites. I would recommend using the BBQ if staying for a while just to save some money. The restaurant was expensive but not THAT bad (we were at a resort, afterall). It was our first time trying Kobe Beef - and it was DELICIOUS!! I think we paid $28 for the steak (that was a la carte - no side dishes) The pizza was enough for 2 people and only cost 12 bucks. I'm used to spending 60 bucks at a holiday inn and getting the usual crap bed and cardboard towels. To stay here for $120 after all was said and done was amazing! I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you were to book at full rate, (just cause I'm cheap) but if you get this place discounted, it's totally worth it. It was a nice little splurge for my husband and I. The vineyard around the hotel is nice, and you definitely feel safe. I think we had to use our room key 3 times before actually getting to our room door. The only complaint I have is the bartender at The Cave. It is the little bar where you can go wine tasting. She ignored us from the get go. I'm not sure if she could tell we didn't belong there or what, but she only came by to give us our wine and our check. She was more than happy to converse with the other patrons - about the beach, directions, night life, wine, friends, clothes, etc...but with us, it was like we were lepers. That didn't make us enjoy our wine tasting experience very much. (b/c while she was yapping, our glasses were empty). I'm sure at least the others liked their experience better ;) The location is definitely not as nice as some, it is smack in the middle of a business complex, but the amenities on the property more than made up for the location. If I could get this room for the same price again, I would probably stay here next time. But if I could get a quaint B&B for the same price I would probably do that instead, just because I think it would ft the whole Napa Valley Feel that I was looking for a little better. And I would take their wine tasting tour instead of vising their bartender in the Cave. I think the tour included 4 wineries, with the shuttle from the resort and back again for an all day outing about $75.

We were aware of the additional approx. $20 resort fee as well. The Vino Bello Resort is a nice place to stay, but I would certainly not call it 4-Star. Our room: On the plus side, it did have a refirgerator; wet bar; and included bottled water, soda, and a bottle of wine. On the negative side, it was pretty narrow and not that big, the heating system was VERY loud (when it turned on it would wake us up). Further, the walls are VERY thin, as we were woken up by a neighbor's TV early one morning, and could hear a late-night conversation of another neighbor. Also, the Vino Bello rooms are an outside walk away from the main Meritage Resort area (which presumably are more expensive). Amenities: We did not find the Concierge or front-desk very helpful (even for some simple direction advice). The attached restaurant has a very good breakfast. The workout facilities were OK and the wine-tasting appetiers are really just cheese and crackers. There was also a billing mix-up that has yet to be resolved -- but I don't know it that is the hotel's fault or hotwire's fault. Location: The resort is located in a corporate/industrial area, not very close to any vinyards. So the views aren't that wonderful; however, you can get to the Silverado Trail and Napa proper pretty easily (much quicker than if your staying in Carneros or Sonoma). Overall, we probably wouldn't stay here again. They claim it's a 4-star. The price we paid was about what you'd pay for a 3-star (or 3.5). And we felt it was actually a 3-star (or 2.5).

Perfect if you are exploring Napa and surrounding area because after a long day of wine tasting, its nice to relax in a beautifully appointed, fully equiped new 'apartment suite. If youre like us, it was nice to relax in an 'at home' setting - fireplace, balcony, gorgeous kitchen -after a wonderful day @ the wineries. The 24 hr room service was prompt and very good. Spa was gorgeous (and expensive). Some reviewers mention highway proximity as an issue but we found it convenient (this property in a 'corporate park' but still very nice. Therefore, higher level floors and pool view might be best.) Check your room folder for specials that are not apparent. For example, we later discovered we could have added services to our massages for no charge but did not know (nor were told). DVDs & CDs are available @ the front desk but we only learned that from these reviews, not the hotel. The drawback here (altho experienced travelers will navigate these issues) is that the staff is woefully undertrained or seems in some instances, simply untrained in hospitality. Nice and willing, but totally clueless. This was generally the case and most especially at the valet stand where the young man greated us with 'huh?' when we pulled up and asked whether we should park or leave the car w/him. Maybe it was because he was chewing his lunch loudly. He never asked if we were with the hotel or condo and consequently, we removed our own luggage - he took the car. We needed to retrieve the car which could not be located (10 minutes later), redeposit our luggage and drive back over to the condo section. A bit annoying after a long,east coast flight and drive up from San Fran. On the way up, we stopped for lunch @ Horizons in Sausilito (wonderful) and then a little detour thru Muir Woods - nice to see but not much there if youre not awed by nature. (Trees are over 1000 years old!). As for Napa, do stop for breakfast @ Sarafornia on Lincoln Ave in Calistoga for excellent, home made inexpensive fare. We were unimpressed by Rutherford Grille for lunch/dinner tho everyone seems to recommend it - expensive, very limited wine list and smelled like kenny rogers roasters restaurant. St. Helena Olive Oil Company was a treat to break up the wine tastings (altho the pesto we purchased was confiscated @ the airport because we did not pack it in our checked luggage.) You can taste everything in the store thats for sale. There are hundreds of wineries and you should sample several but we found the 'touristy' ones just fine for first time visitors. (check out many wine country internet coupon specials for wine tastings, etc.) We especially liked Sterling (for the tram ride) and Mondavi (for the tour and grounds) and our favorite was Domaine Carneros where on a lovely terrace - my husband sipped pinot noirs while i tasted the sparkling wines. Don Giovanis (napa?) looked very good for dinner but after a second long winery day - we were again just as happy to have room service instead and watch a movie on one of the two flat screens in the condo. We left on the third day back to San Fran. Check out both Franciscan's on the wharf which even tho in the center of touristville- was excellent for crab and had great decor/views...and Vincentos (on Taylor?) in financial district for dinner. We also had a great time on Adventure Cats sunset bay sail. Great crew! Ecclectic, culturally mixed crowd of passengers made a fun/interesting 1.5 hrs. w/beautiful photo ops. Lunch @ Left at Albequerqe on Union in Pacific Heights was a wonderful surprise find - outstanding, inexpensive fresh food w/cafe seating.

She didn't know where in the complex my room was, (or she was embarrassed of the room she had assigned.) Next, after being shoved off from the front desk to the \"concierge,\" to get a local area map when the \"concierge\" lady finally stopped talking to her friend or co-worker, she immediately when into her routine of trying to bribe me into submitting to a sales pitch to buy into the time-share. After telling her I was only there for a couple of days and didn't care to spend my vacation time listening to a sales pitch, I was treated rudely. I had to get her attention again to ask for a local map, and was told to look in the local magazine. Fifth, upon entering my room it was small but well appointed. I opened the curtains on the patio to see the back of the time-share sales office. Temporary office trailers, with big loud air conditioning units, what a view! Of course I called the front desk to see if they had a better room available, luckily they did, no offers to have a bellman move us, just a come switch out your keys (the office is at least a football field away from the condos.) Our new room had a view of the pool, which was better, but when sitting on our patio we got to hear the sales pitch over and over again, as the sales team herded prospective buyers through the complex. Our next experience with Vino Bello is one of an overall design flaw, noise. The paths and walkways around the complex are concrete, and brick. Since the Vino Bello are not in close proximity with the restaurant, and other utilities used to service there guests, the staff has to push hard wheeled carts around on these paths, \" KA-CLUNCK....KA-CLUNCK....KA-CLUNCK, dat,dat,dat,dat,dat,dat,dat,KA-CLUNCK....KA-CLUNK. You get the picture right. These noises started around 7 am, right when you feel like getting up, after wine tasting the day before. Overall, I would not stay here again. Mainly, because of the time-share deal, and the ignorance of the designer's choices in either the materials used to make the pathways or the choice of having the staff use the same walkways as patrons to service the rooms.

Our key cards stopped working at one point (as did the couple we were traveling with), and although the desk staff fixed them and explained that they tend to become demagnatized (or something), he was not very courteous about it. Desk staff also seemed unconcerned when I reported that the washing machine was apparently in need of service as it seemed like there were loose parts, resulting in sounding like a jackhammer. Furthermore, the couple traveling with us had reserved a one bedroom and were given a studio. When they addressed this with the desk staff, they were rude and dismissive and said they would need to take it up with Hotels.com. All of these are things that happen, but a simple, \"I'm so sorry for the inconvenience - let me see what I can do...\" goes a long way in my book.", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cWine, sun, wine and wine in Napa Valley\u201d", "Author": "Carlito106ohYeah", "ReviewID": "UR8375980", "Content": "Whats up. So me and the lovely wife went to the Vino Bello (Meritage) Resort in Napa Valley this June for 5 days for our 2 year anniv. Had a super great time. First off..The Resort: The Good-Rooms are really big (all with balconies, some with bedroom hot tubs...not mine. Also, I recomend requesting a room with a pool view, not parking lot view..like mine), LCD TVs, 2 nice pools with heated jacuzzis, great Cave wine Bar/Spa (built into the ground, under newly planted grape fields), good price, within 5 miles of downtown Napa. The Bad-The doors close loudly, service aint that great, and its in a corporate park 10-15 miles from the main strip of vineyards (in fact, you really should rent a car for this trip). We did the hot air ballon thing with napa valley ballons...was fn terrific! (ran over a rabbit on the way...ugh, it still haunts me...I mean, it wasnt even dawn yet, it was still way dark, I tried to swerve, he had no chance). The napa valley train was not worth it...too expensive, too slow, boring (rent a car, drive to a bunch of vineyards and get private tastings, and you will have a much better time). Go to the tastings during the week if at all possible (to avoid crazy SF weekend crowds) and talk to the wine pourer...they know a lot of sh*t, love to talk about wine and can point out their favorite vineyards...being wine novices, we learned a lot, quickly. If you don't know what tannen is before napa you will after. A few places we especially dug: Mondavi, Fransiscan, Arrowhead, Chandon (champagne). Hope the pics came out ok. Have a great day!!

Bad experiences: - unfriendly, unconcerned attitude from front desk people (probably due to a lack of training on the part of the management, but common sense would be to make the customer believe you are actually interested in helping them instead of being indifferent). No professionalism, whatsover. - no offer for compensation after we complained about not being able to sleep the first night with the air conditioning not being able to turn off. The front desk responded that there was no way to help us since the service personnel was not available at the time. The front desk did not make a note of the problem so it could be fixed, instead we had to complain the next day. - a lack of communication between front desk and service personnel. (Having to visit the front desk twice, at 10 am and 5 pm to check on service to a malfunctioning air conditioning system that wasn't even begun until we requested the manager at 5 pm to take care of this, is unacceptable for a hotel). Their response was to shut off the air conditioning unit completely without letting us know what was happening. Is the customer supposed to perform investigations to find out what's going? I don't think so. The hotel should be notifying any guest about updates when something is wrong with their room. The next night the room was stuffy, and we had to sleep with the sliding door cracked open. This place seems to not care about investing in good training for any of the people who work here ( I can not speak for the restaurant or bar since I didn't experience them). They give the impression that they are only concerned in selling their time share condos. It would serve them well to change this impression if they want any repeat stays from anyone. I would never suggest this place to any of my friends or family. it's best to stay somewhere else that has a better location (not near a highway, power lines, and a satellite station, their website photos are misleading), better customer service, and better price/value.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot Good\u201d", "Author": "emis", "ReviewID": "UR8361862", "Content": "Positive :new clean rooms, nice pool area.

The hotel is located next to / part of an office/industrial park on one side, highway and satelite dish farm on the other so this is not a very romantic location. Parking space is also an issue and many cars are parked outside of the property. Sound proofing is minimal, you can hear somebody walking above your room, so if you go take the top floor.

While I found many of the complaints to be valid I do not feel that they are egregious enough to prevent me from giving this resort a positive review. I will address each of the complaints individually. 1. The resort is in an office park. This is true, however, one would not know you were in an office park while on the premises. While on resort grounds you cannot see any office buildings nor experience any office traffic; you only know you're in an office park by using one of the two street entrances to the resort. I stayed Monday through Friday and did not have any office park experience while there. 2. The resort is close to a highway. This also is true; the resort is nestled in the \"crotch\" of two main roads. However, while you can see the road from the parking lot you are not close enough to hear any traffic from the roads or let the existence of the road detract from the otherwise fine view of the fields. 3. The room keys stop working. Absolutely. On the third day our key cards mysteriously stopped working. Although I was on the lookout for this potential problem I neglected to tell my girlfriend who was greatly inconvenienced. She was carrying packages to our room (while I was stumbling around the wine cave) and she had to go to the main hotel building (The Meritage) in order to get new keys made. A bellhop blamed the inexperience of the front desk staff but I think there is a greater problem here since this is a complaint many of the reviewers had. 4. You can hear doors slamming. Dead on. This is perhaps the biggest complaint I have about this resort. While we did not hear noises from other rooms (voices, tv, sounds of intimacy, etc.) we constantly heard doors closing. This was very irritating - especially at night. 5. Inexperienced staff. I am unsure about this one. Although one staff member said it about other staff members (as I discussed above) I cannot definitively state that the staff is inexperienced. The only example of incompetence (not necessarily inexperience) was that after we ordered room service (one sandwich) they forgot we ever ordered it. When we called to see where the sandwich was they confessed and then delivered the sandwich promptly - and gratis. 6. Dearth of close parking. This is also true. One night we had to park on the other end of the resort as all of the spots immediately adjacent to the resort buildings were taken. As we are relatively young and healthy this did not pose much of a problem for us; just an inconvenience. 7. The resort is far from the city center and wineries. This is true. However, it's not like you walk from one attraction to another in Napa - you have to drive . Since you're driving anyway, an extra 3-5 minutes in the car won't kill you. 8. The concierge will try to sell you a timeshare. True. After speaking with the concierge for 10 minutes she invited us to a Shell Vacations pitch meeting with the enticement of coupons, etc. However, a quick \"no, thank you\" ended her endeavor. Interestingly, while at a SF Giants game a table of gentlemen from Shell Vacations offered us similar enticements - and even added a few free nights at the Vino Bello - if I were to go to their pitch. I'll add a few last complaints before I address the virtues. The housekeeping staff is overly eager. The housekeepers try to access the room starting at 9AM and then keep coming back every 20-30 minutes either knocking first or just trying to enter with their keys. After this happened the first morning we made sure to hang the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door until we left the room in the morning. However, one morning when we decided to sleep in very late (it happens when you do many wine tastings the day before without availing yourself of the spit bucket) the sign did not dissuade the staff who repeatedly knocked on our door from early morning until we left in the early afternoon. The housekeepers lost out on a nice tip because of this. One last complaint is about checkout time. The reservation I made stated that checkout time was noon. The hotel literature in the room stated it was noon. A sign in the room said it was 11AM. On the morning of checkout I was told by the front desk that it was 11AM; although they graciously gave me a \"late\" checkout at 11:45AM. Reminding them that their own literature gave the time at noon did not give me that extra 15 minutes. Since I am a rebel I checked out at 11:50. Now on to the good points. The rooms are very nice - nice bed and pillows, large bathroom, tub/shower easily accommodated my 6'3\" frame, washer/dryer in every room and the rooms are just nicely appointed. Although I was hoping to get a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite (as did another reviewer) an Acura management outing that took up a large part of the resort seemed to put the kibosh on my hopes of getting a bigger room. The studio was fine - not huge but big enough - but it irked me that we were missing out on a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. Oh well. When you check in there are free bottles of water, cans of soda and a bottle of white wine in the refrigerator. It was not until the last day that I realized that they replace the water and soda on a daily basis - I was stupidly buying my own bottled water and soft drinks when I could have had them for free all along. I am unsure if they replace the bottle of wine because I never drank it; but I doubt they do. The outdoor pool and hot tub are fine. The spa is just as expensive as any other hotel - so I didn't try it. The wine cave was nothing more than a bar - nothing fascinating there. The bartender was nice and told me that they expect the vines on the premises to start being productive in a few years. Meanwhile they serve wine from their house brand whose grapes come from other parts of California. Overall, my experience at the Vino Bello resort was fine. It is not a resort that is a destination in and of itself but it is a perfectly nice place to lay your head and go for a quick dip when on a trip visiting wineries. If you can book this place in the area of $200/night you should not pass it up.

Vino Bello is part of a timeshare plan, but they also rent the condos (studios, one-bedrooms, and two-bedrooms) on a nightly busy (which is what we did). Good Points: The condo itself. We stayed in a one-bedroom condo on the second floor. Very nice, spacious, new place. Full-sized kitchen with granite countertops, stainless appliances, dishes/glasses/pans, etc. Large bath with granite countertop, double sinks, large walk-in shower with tumbled marble/stone tile work on two walls and floor, seamless glass on remaining two walls, 5 showerheads (one large rain head and four pulsating bodysprays). Jacuzzi bath tub in stone surround in bedroom (actually in kind of a dressing alcove in bedroom, between room and bathroom). 37\" flat screen TV in living room and 26\" flatscreen TV in bedroom. Large balcony with table and 4 chairs, plus small settee (we lucked out and got a second floor room overlooking the balcony - recommend 2nd floor over 3rd floor as 3rd floor balconies don't have a roof, and the sun can get pretty hot! Bad Points: As mentioned in other reviews, service is definitely a problem. Checked in at 2:30 pm (check in time is 4:00 pm), told room would be expedited and we would be called on cell phone - finally went back to desk at 5:15 pm as never got a call. Turns out room had been ready since 3 pm but the lone front desk agent was too busy to call. Food at Siena was just OK for lunch but highly disappointing for dinner. Because we travelled on our anniversary, I decided that we would be too tired to leave the resort for dinner. Since the dinner menu at Sienna looked good on the website, I booked a table through Open Table, indicating it was our first wedding anniversary. When we arrived at Siena for dinner, it was practically deserted. There was no acknowledgement of our anniversary (no congratulations, offer of dessert or whatever). We were disappointed to find that, rather than the menu posted on the resort's website, we were given the same menu as we were given earlier that day for lunch (while waiting for the room to be ready). My husband's food was just OK while my rotisserie chicken was terrible - very dry - and the tiramisu was also not good. We didn't go back at all the rest of the stay. On third day, key cards didn't work - had to walk to front desk for new ones. On fourth day, I got locked out of room after going to the vending machine (again, key card didn't work) and there was no way to reach my husband (each set of two rooms has a little foyer with a locked foyer door to the hall - no doorbell from hall and no way for my husband to hear me knocking on the foyer door). I wandered throughout the building looking for a house phone to call my husband, but there aren't any. Just as I was about to give up and walk back to the front desk (in another building across the parking lot, at the Meritage Hotel), I tried knocking at the foyer door and luckily my husband had just stepped into the foyer in preparation for looking for me - I had been gone about 20 minutes on what should have been a 5 minute vending machine visit. All in all, I would definitely stay there again - the condo was lovely (though perhaps they overdid the wine decor slightly) and spacious, and the rates were extremely reasonable for Napa.

This is our second stay here; the first being in Dec. 2006. We absolutely love this luxurious hotel and the one bedroom suite. The suite with its full kitchen and high end finishes, ample sized bathroom, luxuriously appointed bedroom, comfortable living room, and porch overlooking the pool area is perfect for our family of five. Having experienced the colder climate of Napa in December and our recent stay during July 4th, our family fully enjoyed the swimming pool, kiddies\u2019 pool, kid\u2019s water play area, and BBQ this time around a lot more. While the kids played at the pool, the wives were able to enjoy a pampered experience at the newly opened Terra Spa (built into the hillside as a cave). We never ate at the restaurant located at the hotel because the wonderful kitchen allowed us to prepare our meals and presented a more comfortable experience for our kids. The best part is the large dining table and cushioned bench to accommodate our family, along with al fresco dining option on the patio. Another great feature about the property is the vestibule off the main hallway door that connected the studio that my brother and his family stayed in. It allowed us to prop our respective doors open for free ingress and egress. For the minus on this stay, since we had to utilize the AC this time around (as opposed to in Dec.) it was definitely on the loud side. It makes it a little hard to sleep when it kicks on at night. Also, not sure if they were short staff due to the holiday or not, but there was trash overflowing at the BBQ area for over a day before I had to take my time to call housekeeping to come pick it up. In addition, the housekeeping service was very late in coming to clean our suite. When they did come around 5 PM, we were already back to our room and with my entire family in there, the housekeeping staff was a little disoriented and not able to clean as normal when the room is unoccupied. Other small things, the washer and dryer are not the most user friendly, even with the abbreviated instructions posted on the units. No express check out from your room.
