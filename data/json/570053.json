So I bit the bullet and I'm glad I did. First off, it's extremely easy to find, just a block or so down from Station Barberini, which is only 2 stops from Termini. When you get there you realise just how close it is to the sites in this part of Rome - the Trevi is extremely close by and the Spanish Steps only a few blocks away. When you get there you go up one flight of stairs (a lift is available) and are greeted by a smiling Patty at the door. Patty is the 3rd generation owner of the Boccaccio and a lovely, maternal presence in the house. If nots really a hostel, nor pension or hotel. It really is an extension of Patty's home, and guests are encouraged to treat it that way. So no fancy locks, TVs, air con, etc. There's a few flyers by the door, but Patty has a wealth of knowledge to share if you need insight into Rome. I stayed in the single room overlooking the front door. I've heard other reviews mention the noise but I was fine. It's bright, sunny, big for a single, comfortable and sported a sink and cupboard. It was also very clean, and the cleaner does come around every day to tidy up. There's a separate bathroom and another shower/toilet room down the hall which is also maintained well. I suppose where one's expectations need to be adjusted is that this really is Patty's home, and if you're comfortable in that kinda space it's lovely. What separates it from hostels is the level of service, even if the amenities are similar to what you can get elsewhere. I'd definitely recommend it for travellers who want a personable experience in Rome.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Podgorica", "Title": "\u201cgreat value and great location\u201d", "Author": "AnnaPG", "ReviewID": "UR127963780", "Content": "As we were first time in Rome it was more then easy to find the hotel, it took us 3 min from Barberini metro station.

It\u2019s centrally located and only a 5 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain. The Spanish Steps, Pantheon and Piazza Navona are all within walking distance. From Roma Termini take Metro Line A to Barbarini. (This is only 2 stops from Roma Termini) or you can walk and that takes only 15-20 minutes. Hotel Boccaccio is in the same building as the Hotel De Petris. When you enter the main floor area, you will see 2 lifts/elevators. The lift for Hotel Boccaccio is slightly to your right. The one that you will see directly in front of you is for Hotel De Petris. Just hop onto the lift and press \u201c1\u201d and when the elevator door opens Hotel Boccaccio will be right in front of you. I arrived around 11pm and Patrizia was graciously waiting for me. Patrizia is the owner and this hotel is also her home. Once inside Boccaccio, the guest rooms are in front and slightly to the left. I had emailed the day before advising that my plane would be in late and Patrizia promptly replied that she would be waiting for me. Upon arrival I was given the keys. A key is given for the hotel room, the hotel entrance on the 1st floor and the outside entrance to the building. So basically you have 24 hour access. I booked a single room with shared bathroom and shared shower. There was never a wait to use these facilities which was great. There are 2 bathrooms one with a shower and one without and they are side by side in the hallway. The room I had faced Via Del Boccaccio. There is a great ambiance of Italian restaurants at night on this street so shut your window if you don\u2019t like the sound. My room included: Sink with mirror, towels, Eco friendly soaps & shower foam, bed lamp, large closet; desk with lamp, fan, lovely large window and double bed. Energy conserving light bulbs are used throughout the property. Also, because this is an eco-hotel, the towels are not changed everyday. I have taken a photo of their eco policy for further reading. There is free wifi available from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 pm in the lobby. Just take your laptop and sit in the lovely seating area. FYI, because these are old historical buildings the wifi signal does not reach the bedrooms. In the main lobby there are lots of brochures for Rome sight seeing as well as a complimentary maps of Rome. There is no breakfast served at this hotel but there are lots of places to grab a cappuccino and something to eat. Also, there is a grocery store at the end of the street where you can grab fresh baked goods, fruit, water, juice, pre-made sandwiches etc. I had complete privacy during my 3 night stay and if I had any questions Patrizia was available to answer them. I enjoyed my stay in this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Patrizia is really nice and that adds to the great energy of the place.
