They refuse to consider the issue and after 2 months of dealing with their accounting office and my credit card company, the issue is still unresolved. Their customer service is horrific.

A special thank you goes to Ms. Pamela in the Executive Club Level. We enjoyed breakfast there daily, and her and her staff were especially wonderful and friendly.

It was nice but had a few issues. The first was that the sheets were stained with what looked like blood. Due to flight delays, we didn't get check in until about 2am and after realizing that the sheets were clean and the stain as old, we avoided that section of the bed (it was a king size) and went to sleep. If it had been earlier, I would have insisted on new sheets. It was a stain that the person making the bed had to have seen too. That sheet should not have been used in a guest room! It did make me wonder if cleaning corners had been cut elsewhere. The other problem in the room was the air conditioner. The panel was off the wall and just resting next to it and sticking out. We asked if it could be reattached (it appeared to be missing its screws) but it was never taken care of. It also was having trouble keeping the room cool evn though we set it for as low as it could go. It was a little but cooler than average for NOLA in July when we were there so it wasn't horrible but if it had been normal temps, it would have been uncomfortably warm. Now the good: fantastic location! It has a little bit of street noise (but it's a city so of course!) but overall was a quiet hotel so you could enjoy the French Quarter but still get away from the hubbub when you wanted to. The staff was very friendly and everyone said hello when they passed you in the hallways. Common areas were clean and check in was easy. Checking out was a little harder but that was because they let us have a late check out and we happened to hit a tour group checking in as we were trying to check out. It happens! The room was nice. There was a lot of room to spread out in (and lots if counter space in the bathroom!) The bed (with clean unstained sheets) was very comfortable. It was great to have wifi and coffee in the room. I know there have been some complaints about the brand of coffee in the rooms on here so I wasn't expecting much but it was very good coffee! Overall, I don't know if I will ever go back to New Orleans. (It seemed to be a see it once type place but I am not opposed to visiting the city again either.) If I did go back, I would consider staying at this hotel again if the price wasn't too outlandish. I would recommend it to friends but not as a \"you gotta stay here!\" type place. But in all fairness, there is not where else I would recommend as a better choice either.

We had very different experiences on the two visits. In 2011 we arrived in the early afternoon and were given rooms facing an alley. We slept very well, found the hotel staff very pleasant, and were genuinely happy with the food from room service. The location, on a slightly seedy part of Canal Street, isn't ideal with children, but we had made the reservation from the road during a peak travel season, had trouble finding any rooms in New Orleans, and were grateful to have found space in a hotel that close to the French Quarter. In 2012 we arrived at night, after a long drive. When I mentioned our reservation request for a room in a quiet location, the clerk was honest enough to admit that nothing like that was available, but then said that she was upgrading us to 2 king suites, which were next to each other, which would make us very comfortable with the children. The bedrooms both faced right onto Bourbon Street, which meant that the New Orleans party noise went on until dawn. There seemed to be no glazing on the windows to cut the sound. Luckily, I had a fan in the car. I used that and ear plugs and managed to sleep. My husband, who can normally sleep through almost any noise, didn't sleep at all.

There were three people in the hotel lobby that knew we checked in all staff members. We brought our bags to the room and went out to eat. I was the last to leave my room, I ran back in to grab my iphone (thank goodness) and shut the door. When we came back ~12:00am, my laptop bag was gone, my friends camera, and expensive bottles of alcohol were all taken from the room. No signs of forced entry or anything. When we called the hotel staff to report the incident, they had no interest whatsoever to help us, make us feel better, or feel safe. In fact, they first question was \"Are you sure you brought your laptop?\" I was absolutely sure I did, because the robber was actually very courteous and left my house keys and my wedding invitations (both were in my laptop bag) nicely stacked on the bed. There second question was are you sure you locked the door. Normally both of these questions would be legit questions to ask, however, after repeated assurances that we were certain of both facts, the staff continued to press the issue like it was our fault. I later found out why they kept pressing the issue because they not only did not want to be charged with a crime but they wanted to cover themselves insurance wise. The insurance company called me a month later and said that the hotel told them that I stated, \"I was not sure that I brought a laptop nor was i sure I shut the door behind me.\" When we asked them to check the security cameras, they said they didn't have any, and that it would be an \"invasion of privacy\". Last time I checked, most hotels have security cameras everywhere including the hallways. We didn't expected much, but they really didn't give much nor did they give us an reassurance that it wouldn't happen again. The next day when we talked to the day manager, I noticed that the girl that check us in was watching us out of the corner of her eye as we were talking to him. I don't know what her reason was, but it didn't look or feel right. In any event, the day manager also was not very helpful, but at least he told us that he would contact the insurance company and gave us his card to contact him if we had any further questions. After wasting a full day of trying to get some help from the hotel staff, we decided to drop the issue and try to have a good time. However, the staff would not let us do that. On our last day there, we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant, for whatever stupid reason. It took them 1.5 hours just to get our food AND they messed up our order. The manager did his best to make things better, but still brought us the wrong order. The food was also over priced. You could easily get the same quality food right out side for less than half the price. We thought we would finish up the trip with a nice lunch at a \"fancy restaurant\" and it ended up being the worse meal we had in New Orleans. On top of all this, we had \"fantastic\" bell service. We had left our bags with the bell service before eating and when we went back to get them (1) rather than getting our bags, they brought us into the conference room and made us pick up our own bags. (Doesn't usually bell service mean \"I'll bring your bags wherever you need?\" (2) They lost one of our bags. When we said we had nine bags, their inital response was, \"are you sure you had a blue bag with a brown handle?\". Their second response was \"I don't know what happened to your bag, I put them all right here.\" Rather than going to look for our bag. I sawed they had moved our bags from the bell room to the conference room. When i asked if maybe they bag was in the bell room, the bellman's response was, \"No, i put all the bags in that room.\" So I walked over they myself, and pointed out the bag, right there on the first shelf. Rather than apologizing, he starting getting defensive and giving us excuses. I don't know if he was just lazy, or trying to steal our bag, but it doesn't matter. I'm a pretty low maintenance guy and this by far was the worse experience I've ever had. I've stayed in 2 star, 3 star hotels/motels and gotten better service. I stayed at Crowne Plazas in other cities, and this one just doesn't compare. I don't think this is a real Crowne Plaza. Bottom line - The rooms are actually nice to sleep in BUT sub par service; sub par food SUB PAR SECURITY. If you stay here, bring your valuables with you, don't leave anything in the room. Don't expect the staff to help if you need something. Expect 1 star service and security and you'll be straight.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat for French Quarter\u201d", "Author": "PhilbeachTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR134799250", "Content": "Being an older hotel, our room was on the small side but very nicely decorated. The aircon was a bit temperamental (freezing at night but not very efficient during the day). Bed was big and comfy but would be a challenge for vertically challenged people as it was very high. The bathroom was a bit cramped and very little space to put toiletries etc. The coffee maker was in the bathroom which I found extremely bizarre, if not a tad unhygenic. The hairdryer was the best I've ever encountered in a hotel - very powerful. WiFi was a bit funny - couldn't connect in the room for free but if you go into the lobby and connect down there, it'll work in your room (for 24 hours). Reception staff could have been better. We were part of a group of 35 and we were given the wrong room - not a huge deal. Instead of just changing the names around, the receptionist kept insisting we go and knock on the door of our 'real' room and ask our fellow travellers to switch. As it was already about 10 pm, we really couldn't see the point in disrupting them and so asked the receptionist to just change the booking which I could see she really took umbrage with. As it turned out, I'm not sure she actually did this as to connect to the WiFi you have to type in your name and room number. If I had been naughty, I could have charged things to the other couple as they were still registered to our room number. Other people in our party had issues with Reception, mainly lack of responsiveness or the impression that they didn't actually care. Being in a busy part of the city, we had no problem with noise. The lobby/common areas were nicely decorated but busy with a lot of functions so was sometimes hard to negotiate through the crowds. The bar got very busy at the weekend, with only one bartender so they need to look at staffing levels during peak times. Our tour operator had arranged for us to have breakfast included (I don't think it normally is) and this was served in one of the conference rooms. Pretty poor choice and the 'bouncers' or whatever they were, fairly rude and unaccommodating. No cereal or toast until we asked and then it was brought up reluctantly.

On a hot Saturday, it took them 2 hours (we had to wait outside-nowhere to sit, it was sweltering) to get our previously valet-parked car, which was parked 3 blocks and 8 lights away--this is a far cry from the \"just give us a call 15 minutes before you leave\" that we were instructed to do when we dropped the car off. When we came back that evening, we asked the lady at the front desk how to avoid that nightmare when we were leaving on Sunday. She just kept repeating the same thing: to call 15 minutes before we were ready to leave. We tried to explain that we did that earlier that day and no one answered. When we asked if we could just call the front desk if no one answered the valet parking number, she said no because all she was going to do is forward our call back to the number that no one answered. Her face said \"I don't really care\". She was interrupting, abrasive, and extremely frustrating. She didn't have anything to say except call 15 min before you leave, like a broken record. No' I'm sorry', 'let me find out', or anything. A kind or understanding word here would have gone a long way, instead we were made to feel like we were unwelcome and bothering her. She was so Freaking Rude!! This woman was actually in the middle of stapling people's parking bills together along with another sheet of paper that said we would be taking a shuttle bus to the parking garage the next morning. We got this shoved under our door later that night. Did she not read the darn thing? Or was she being sarcastic by repeating the 'call 15 minutes before you leave' mantra. Wow.

It was hot and chaotic, but that pretty much describes every parking lot in New Orleans. I could have overlooked that if it weren't for the incredibly poor customer service we received after a scary encounter with another guest. The hotel itself is centrally located and nicely decorated, the room was comfortable and fairly clean, although the toilet had been used and not flushed when we arrived. I also feel that for the price they charge for this hotel, a continental breakfast would have been a nice touch. These are nit-picky items and not a deal breaker, but the customer service killed any chances that we will ever return to ANY Crowne hotels. At 12:30 a.m. my family was woken by very loud banging on our door by an aggressive, loud intoxicated man trying to get in to the room. My children were terrified. My husband spent 15 minutes trying to convince the man that he had the wrong room. The man went down the hallway trying other doors before he came back to ours again. I called security while my husband again tried to get the increasingly belligerent man to understand that he was at the wrong room. Ten minutes later security arrived. The guard explained to the man that he had to stop knocking on doors and the man explained that he was a guest who had been separated from his group who had the key to his room. He was directed back to the front desk by the security guard and told to ask for a replacement key. The man left and we thought that was the end. Just about the time I got the kids calmed back down, the man was back, this time trying to use his key to unlock our door, and banging and yelling for us to let him in. My husband again told him he was at the wrong room, and he wandered off to try his key on several more doors before he left. In the morning my husband inquired at the front desk why the man was allowed to wander the hallways after he was given a replacement key instead of being escorted by hotel staff to the correct room. It was irresponsible of the hotel staff to let a belligerent, intoxicated individual wander the hallways in the middle of the night pounding on doors and yelling at the other guests. Not only was the staff completely unsympathetic and unconcerned, they refused to offer any sort of compensation. We were told that because we booked our trip through a third party, they had no responsibility or authorization to offer any compensation. We travel frequently and have received far better service at far less expensive hotels. We love New Orleans and expect that it will be loud, chaotic and full of drunks.

This was great because you can easily walk (< 1 minute) down Bourbon St. for the night life, Hit CVS or Wall Greens right across the street if you need anything or hop on the trolly-street car that takes you into the Garden District. There are plenty of shops along canal as well. Also if you book tours, Its easy for the tour shuttles to park in front of the Hotel and pick you up since Canal is a large boulevard. They have a bar in the lobby thats nice, clean but small. The pool area is fair but the area around it is nice. The rooms were nice, cozy and very comfortable!!! Valet parking was $30/night which is standard for the industry. The business center was great, You can use the computer and print stuff for free. There were only 3 computers so I'd recommend going early or during off hours if you need to get stuff done for work etc. The second floor has a balcony that was great looking down on Bourbon street that have no seats but tables to set your drinks on. No glass allowed up there for obvious reasons. The staff with the exception of Brittany at the front desk (mid shift) were very nice and helpful. The not-so-good: I don't like sounding negative but I got to write an honest review. I stayed there 5 nights and would leave the room by 8:00 AM and return by 5:00 PM with no new towels nor the room cleaned every day of my stay. I'd have to call daily and request towels and cleaning. (the cleanings not a big deal but the towels I prefer changed) The staff was very nice and friendly when cleaning. The walls were thin...at least in our room. We could here very loudly the sinks being turned on, the showers running, people dropping things in the shower, toilets flushing. It didn't ruin any sleep or anything but just thought I'd mention it because we thought it was odd...that it was sooo loud. My worst experience of my stay was dealing with Brittany at the front desk.....I approach the front desk as she was talking to her co-worker about what she wants to do when she gets out of work tonight, I didn't interrupt because I thought she would stop and then assist me...uh nope she when on for 3 minutes until I finally asked if they were \"open\" after rolling her eyes and exhaling irritatedly she looked up and said with a VERY bad attitude \"Yes...what did you need?\" I don't want to make this review super long but I had the misfortune of dealing with her 3 more times....all 3 times she had the lazy, I don't want to be here attitude. I must say this bothered me the most because I couldn't believe the RUDENESS and LAZY attitude of this person....So traveler's BEWARE!! Approach with caution when you see Brittany...age 20-25 African American Female working the front desk. I didn't complain to the Management because I had my 87 year old Grand Father with me who hadn't been to NOLA since 1944 and is a WWII Vet. and that day I was taking him to the WWII Museum and with tours scheduled everyday I didn't want to have a time consuming delay by complaining about a bad employee. Aside from that, the stay was nice. Sometimes you got to take the good with the bad. All the other staff aside from Brittany were wonderful!!

Much is within walking distance, including both the Canal St. and St. Charles streetcars, and there are plenty of taxis available out front also.

The concierge, Paul was very helpful to us, making recommendations on sites and restaurants, and booking swamp and plantation tours for us as well! The rooms seems quite large considering the location of the hotel, and compared to other places we stayed in NOLA, butI was NOT overly impressed with the cleanliness of the rooms. The first room we went into had a dirty floor, including bobby pins on the floor that certainly were not mine, and when I went to move the blankets on one of the two beds I pulled out a past guest's itinerary that had been tucked under the fold, so who knows when the bedding on that bed had last been changed... I called down to the front desk, and they moved us to the room directly across the hall, but it certainly didn't seem to be a surprise to them that the room was dirty, and they did not really do anything to make amends for it, such as upgrading our room. The second rooms seemed to be fairly clean, minus the lampshade which appeared to be stained from water damage. It seemed like housekeeping was a bit lax, and arriving rather late, often after noon. The room was very quiet considering the location directly on Bourbon Street, but we were on the ninth floor, which no doubt helped dissipate some of the noise, but we were also pleasantly surprised by the lack of noise from other rooms and within the hotel.

The bed was comfortable with a pillowtop mattress, a comfy arm chair and an ergonomically-correct desk chair. This made room service at the window a comfortable way to dine. Room service was timely and tasty for breakfast and dinner.

The hotel is at best a 2 to 2.5 star hotel with 5 star prices. It is abundantly clear that this hotel could use a major shake up in General Managers as the service was some of the poorest we have ever experienced. It started with our first enounter at the hotel bar where the bartender yelled to a guest of the hotel to come get his drink. The bartender remarked (under his breath that this may be called the \"Big Easy\" but it is not the \"Big Work\"). So, my wife took the drink that the bartender made over to the guest. The next sorry service experience was at the hotel restaurant. We tried to have our first breakfast there. I mean really, how can anyone mess up breakfast?? We had to wait for 45 minutes before our order was taken and then another 45 minutes before finally being served. To make matters worse, when the food arrived for two of the four guests at our table it was unedible. There was never any apology for the delay in taking our order or the delay in bringing our food. When I asked to speak to the manager about the food, I was informed that he \"was too busy\". When we arrived in our room facing Canal Street we noticed there were ear plugs on the table by the television. My wife and remarked at the time that it must be for Mardi Gras when the French Quarter gets crazy. Little did we know that the ear plugs were for nightly use due to frequent ambulance, police and fire runs made by New Orleans emergency personnel. To top it all off, our room was never cleaned our last day at the hotel. My wife and I love New Orleans. We have visited here many times. We love the diversity, the culture, the music and the food, plus, this visit our team, the University of Kentucky won the NCAA Championship.

We travel to New Orleans often & have stayed at various hotels there. The Crown Plaza hotel was just okay, I expected better. We stayed in a suite on the third floor. The first room we were assigned stunk of smoke, while I know this is not the hotel's fault, I would have thought that the maids would have said something to someone when they cleaned the room so it could have been cleaned & santized. After bringing it the hotel's attention, we were assigned another room, which still had trash in it from the previous people. The room was very large with a large sitting room with a tv, a hallway with a bathroom, then the bedroom & two closets. The hallways on the third floor smelled very badly, moldy, but on the our third day there it smelled better, so maybe someone complained & sent someone to freshen up the carpet. We ordered room service twice, once for breakfast & once for supper. The service was fairly quick. Breakfast was good but supper wasn't. I ordered a shrimp po-boy, something that's very easy to make. The shrimp on it was small & obviously pre-breaded/frozen, like you buy at a grocery freezer section. I was disappointed. I expected better in New Orleans. I've gotten better at our local Mama's fried chicken. We also went to the pool & it is very small & the area is small, but the gym is surprisingly large. The executive lounge was closed between 10 or 11am & 4pm daily. All together, it didn't meet our expectations & we probably won't stay there again. Be aware of rooms facing Bourbon Street. There was a band playing all afternoon & most of the night below our window. We used a sound machine, so it drowned out most of the noise. Also, there was a marathon going on the day we left & we forced to either walk 8 blocks with our luggage or wait a few hours to leave. There was no other options given. We would have expected the hotel to have either warned us the night before about this or if possible arrange for a shuttle type form of transportation. So we, along with other guests from the hotel, drug our suitcases along Canal street for 8 blocks, forced our way across running people from the marathon, to finally arrive at our vehicles.

Carpet, curtains, bedskirt, chair not what you would expect from a property rated 4 stars. The sheets appreared clean, and on flashlight inspection we did not detect bedbugs, Yes, we checked! The carpet had fuzz and lint as if it had not been vacuumed properly. The second and third day the room appeared to have been cleaned more thoroughly. Fourth and fith days must have had a different housekeeper as the room was barely touched. The property is extremely noisy, street people seem to collect and play music all night long, in addition the nightly garbage collection at 1am causes much loss of sleep. My friends in the \"suite\" experience much the same, stains on the carpet, curtains and furniture as well as broken furniture in the sitting area. The maid service was poor. The noise was much worse as they were closer to the street. The kicker was when my friend was curling her hair with her curling iron sparks shot out from the outlet in the bathroom. The sparks caught her blouse on fire that went through her shirt and burned her abodmen. The fireworks tripped the circut breaker in the room and all went dark. They called down to the desk and a maintanence man and the manager came up to investigate. I was in the room when the manager told her that he would replace her blouse, as it was the least, he could do.

The hotel location couldn't be any better. The physical condition is great as well - it's a new hotel, only 9 years old or so, but it is architecturally very consistent with the area. The service was generally very good, with the only real problem being the valet parking issue. The hotel location is great, and that's both a positive and a negative. The location, on the corner of Canal and Bourbon, couldn't be any better for a trip to the French Quarter. Besides being right at the French Quarter, it's only a 10 minute walk to Harrah's, and less than a half hour all the way down to the World War II museum. However, the great location means no parking at site, and there's not enough room for drop off and pick up in the front of the hotel - and they can't have people go around the corner, because that's Bourbon Street, which is obviously even worse. The bell staff did help out wonderfully when we got in on a Friday evening by coming down the street and meeting us farther out, helping direct traffic, and making the arrival more pleasant. Check in on the same Friday evening was crowded, but moved very fast. One woman behind the counter saw us and called me around to the end of the counter where she was able to help us right away. They got us checked in and to our room very quickly and efficiently. On the way into the hotel were several tables with a woman selling souvenirs - t-shirts, magnets, masks, beads - which was a little odd for a nice hotel. It did detract from the elegance of the hotel, but it is New Orleans with a crazy party atmosphere, so maybe it wasn't so bad after all. Our room was on the Executive Floor, which is on the fourth floor - surprisingly low, but still nice. The room was larger than average, well appointed, and in good condition. There is a comfortable king size bed that is higher than you might expect (a surprise when you wake up in the morning and have forgotten before you slide off the edge). All the standard amenities are there, including flat screen TV, desk, upholstered chair with ottoman, closet with safe, etc. The chair appears like it might not be comfortable, but was actually nice. As part of the conformance to architectural requirements for the historic district, the windows appear that they can be opened. However, that is just the look, to keep the appearance up outside. They are double paned, which helps with the noise from below. Speaking of the noise, it is on Bourbon Street, but we had no problem on the 4th floor. The bathrooms were what you would expect for a nice hotel like this. No problems at all. A tip, though, if you find yourself singing in the shower, or not feeling very good after indulging in too much alcohol from the night before, keep in mind that your neighbor can hear everything through the ventilation in the shower area. The Executive Lounge was very nice for a US hotel. Breakfast was good, with two hot items that changed each day - one day was sausage and oatmeal, the other was cheese omelette and potatoes. Plus, there were several other good items, including very good croissants - freshly made, not some like you'd find at a grocery store. In the evenings, as others have said, there is wine, beer, and soft drinks, plus appetizers. The drinks were fine - first beer/wine was free - and the cheese and fruit were good. The hot appetizers were standard frozen appetizer quality - not really worth the calories. The staff was very friendly and helpful, continually looping through the room to pick up plates and glasses when needed. We ate breakfast at the buffet in the hotel restaurant one morning, and the buffet was fairly unimpressive. While the food quality was fine (the bacon and sausage were good), it all seemed like it had been out a little long, and the selection wasn't what it should have been - no eggs to order, for example. The layout of the buffet line seemed like an afterthought, too - almost like they set it up just so they could say they had a buffet, but really didn't put in any effort. Checkout was quick and efficient, although there was an extra charge on the bill for each night. I asked the woman at the desk about it, and she promptly took it off without question. However, when I met my wife outside, as she was picking up our car from valet, that's when things got ugly. Several reviewers have mentioned problems with the valet parking, but I didn't realize how bad the problem would be. Because of the aforementioned lack of drop off / pick up space in front of the hotel, there is also a problem with valet when you leave the hotel. The valet parking is expensive - $31+, as mentioned many times for an SUV - but there is generally an understanding that valet parking includes taking your car when you get there and returning it when you leave. They don't quite have the same understanding here. Our first clue was when we called down to have them bring the car around. There was an automated message that they were so busy they weren't accepting calls, and you had to come down in person. Then, when we went to the valet stand, we were told that, if we waited for them to bring the car, it would take AT LEAST 30 minutes (their emphasis, not mine). Or, if we didn't wan to wait, we could take a shuttle to the lot where our car was, and leave from there. We opted for the latter. To add insult to injury, though, it took 10-15 minutes to fill the shuttle, so we had to wait there the entire time. Once we got to the lot, a couple of miles down Canal, we were able to get our car fairly easily. However, it was quite annoying to see the sign on the lot that the car was parked in, and to find out the price for that lot was $2/day. That means I paid them $60 to drive my car down the street. I understand that parking in the FQ and CBD is at a premium, but this was too much. All in all, this is a very nice hotel in a great location in a fun city. We didn't let the valet parking ruin the memory of the trip, but it did leave a sour taste...", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDuana the magnificent\u201d", "Author": "chicostravellin", "ReviewID": "UR126269639", "Content": "Arrived on a Sunday evening for a two night stay.

It is beautiful and located right on Canal and Bourbon, out the door and you are in the middle of it all. The executive lounge is a great place to get away and have a few snacks and offers drinks at very reasonable prices. We also have to say that the onsite restaurant (I am sorry I forget the name) is FANTASTIC. It was the best restaurant that we ate at during our trip. The Duck Confit salad I had was out of this world, and the seafood platter was the best seafood and catfish we had in the city (and we had our share). The prices are great too. When we return again, we will eat here every night. For the management. We cannot tell you how much Duana helped make our stay a fabulous one. We were actually set to leave after the first night, due to the room selection we had been offered as the view was horrible, but Duana made everything right.

It was the perfect location for the event.. close to everything! The hotel was clean. Beds comfy. BUT one day, one of the girls left the safe unlocked, but closed, when we went out for breakfast. When we returned only a few hours later we noticed the safe was wide open. The three of us that were using the safe all counted our money (which we had counted before we left for the day for our budgets). Two of us had $200 missing and one who had less money to begin with had $100 missing...how convenient. Seems to me that it was an attempt to to take just enough but not so much to be noticed...We suspect the thief only took bits from each of us probably hoping Mardi Grasers were partying too hard to count their money each day...wrong!The room had been cleaned and so had our safe... Looks like we would have been better off not to use the safe like the other two girls? We did not immediately report the missing cash because we took it as a stupid tax and didn't know if they would take us seriously since there was no way to prove it since its cash and the safe was unlocked. I understand that there is a reason safes lock but just because something isn't locked does not give a hotel employee the right to steel it..I leave my clothes out and don't expect that to go missing too! When I got home I decided I should notify them. I called the Manager on duty. I expressed that I was not interested in getting any money back as I understood there was no way to prove how much went missing but that I thought he should be aware that someone who had access to our room on the specified day had stolen from our hotel room and who knows how many other guests. He listened. Did not have much to say. Asked for my phone number to follow up...that was over a week ago..still no follow up. Of course I don't expect the money back but a follow up phone call or even an apology would be professional. I will never stay at a Crowne Plaza again as their staff cannot be trusted and their managerial staff are unable to deal with such issues in a caring or professional manner.

Canal is closed down and public transportation is iffy during parades. We spent hours trying to get to the hotel. Had we known where the parking was, we would have left our car and walked with our stuff. The staff is very attentive and helpful - had an issue with the HVAC - and they sent someone from maintenance within 3 minutes.

She interrupted every single question or comment I had. Temperature didn't get remedied. Later in the evening, I called maintenance for help. They did something, using tools. Well, I was no longer cold! By 4am, the heat was unbearable and I just shut the unit off. Within about five minutes, the door on the HVAC unit crashed to the floor, just missing a mirror and putting holes into the wall. Oh, and then there is the scaring 14 lives out of me. At 7am when I went to speak with the front desk about it they were unbelievably uncaring. Did say I could move to another room. But, never offered to help me move, or to put me in a nicer room...nothing. I schlep all my stuff to another room without any help or a cart and see the same lovely roof and HVAC views. On a positive note, the bad customer service by staff was pretty universal. The food was awful. If you look around, you notice it isn't all that clean.

The location of this hotel is perfect...On the corner of Canal and Bourbon streets. A little noisy but you have to expect that when staying that close to Bourbon street. The hotel is very pretty -- Nice lobby. Our first contact was with the valet folks. They were very friendly and helpful. NOTE: The hotel only offers valet which is about $30 a day and your car will actually be parked about 8 blocks from the hotel. It's unlimited in/out if you need your car. We had no use for ours once we arrived. Another thing to note is that it will take, on average, 30 minutes to get your car each time. Could be more if they are shorthanded or busier. We knew that going in, so it was not an issue for us. We ended up leaving some things in the car and they happily took care of running down to the garage and retrieving our items and delivering them to our room. Our next interaction was with the front desk when we checked in. The girl that helped us was not very friendly at all....I would say almost arrogant. She said we would get free internet but offered no further explanation. Of course when we tried to connect to it, it didnt work so we had to call and ask. We still had no luck so decided to forget it. She didnt mention anything about what the hotel had to offer as far as restaurants, bar, etc. so we figured all of that out on our own. Just not very inviting at all. We felt as though she was annoyed being there. Our room....At first glance, it was clean -- I think a bit of a stretch to call it a nice room. There is no refrigerator or microwave. The bed was great - very comfortable. We felt like there were many small things that they could have easily cared for but didnt. The room didnt smell fresh but appeared to be clean. The water pressure in the bathroom was awful. Took forever to get the shampoo out of my hair. The tub faucet was broken and the air vent that you are very close to inside the shower was really dusty and dirty. I dropped something on the floor and got down to look for it under the TV stand -- I found pills from a previous guest, I assumed, dust and other trash so the room had not been thoroughly cleaned in a while. We also had trouble with are room cards for most of the trip. We had to try it 6-7 times to get it to work but it eventually would open. We ordered room service a few times and it was delicious each time and service was good as well. We stayed in an executive suite -- not sure that meant anything as far as a nicer room but it did give us access to the executive lounge. It was a very nice and big room with nice decor, two flat screen TVs, lots of chairs, couches. They offered free breakfast each morning between 6-10am and cocktails and snacks between 6-8pm. During the evening time, they offer a complimentary drink and offered additional drinks at a very low cost which was nice. Overall, not that impressed with the hotel. Not sure that I would stay there again nor would I recommend it to family/friends. It definitely will not be my first choice next time we visit New Orleans.

The St. Charles St. streetcar turns around in front of the hotel. As for the hotel itself, we arrived and departed by taxi, so we didn't have any of the valet parking problems described by others. The reception staff was friendly and efficient without being too \"perky\". I appreciated their businesslike approach. The room was very spacious with two queen beds, a sitting area and a work area with all of the usual amenities. The bathroom was large with an excellent shower with good water pressure.

The rooms, too, seem to be a step above the Crowne Plaza norm. Dark wood furniture with coordinated decor and accents, a nice amount of space, fun seating and top notch beds make for a comfortable stay. The granite and marble bathroom has a coffee maker (with local Community coffee), hair dryer, magnifying mirror, and a Speakman shower head. Bring your own amenities, as theirs are blah. The gym is nicely equipped and there is a small outdoor pool, minus the hot tub. The Bourbon House restaurant will knock your socks off. Huge (!), floor to ceiling windows with a fun view of Bourbon Street, bow-tied wait staff and crisp white linens make for an outstanding first impression. I've included pictures of the menus. The small lobby bar was functional. The Astor Crowne Plaza could easily be a five star property with a few easy changes. The staff was hit and miss.

The front desk staff were less than impressive and useless when it came to helping me solve my internet connection problems (for which there is a $10 charge). The concierge was helpful but was in a huge hurry for no apparent reason. The carpeting in the rooms was also filthy...and could easily be improved with a thorough vacuuming.

We were here for a couple of nights. The pros: The hotel itself is updated and the facilities are worthy of the 4-stars they advertise. Nice and clean as well. This was my biggest concern in advance of the trip and I shouldn't have worried. It's a nice facility. The room was very large. Noise-wise, we asked to be in a \"quiet room\" and were given the 14th floor. The fact that all the rooms have ear plugs for free is a sign that this is an issue. but you should know that going in given the location. It was a non-issue for us in a \"quiet\" room. We heard a street band Saturday night and some commotion, but it was just white noise and in general, that kind of thing doesn't bother me. It was also a convenient walk to the French quarter, etc. Perhaps 10+ minutes to Jackson Sq. The Cons: The service went from just okay to bad. Morale seemed low, people seemed to be doing just the minimum to get the job done. Flat tone in voices, no hurry at all to help even if there's a line of people. We also had a mistake on our bill and had little help with that though it did finally get resolved after 3 different phone calls. The valet was a joke. Don't bring a car to this hotel. We had no choice, we drove into town. Utter lack of communication on the part of the valet service. I guarantee if you stay here and use the valet, you will end up frustrated and it will put a damper on your trip. Finally, the biggest drawback of this hotel for me was the location. I think this is a personal preference, granted. It's just at the edge of the French Quarter but the location (Canal and Bourbon) is really dicey. Canal can be rough in general and then on top of that, Bourbon St, particularly that end, is just sleezy with the Hustler club, etc etc. Many people LOVE being right on Bourbon, so just know when you go. But for me I prefer more of the charm of the rest of the French Quarter rather than the drunken slop of Bourbon, so I'll stay somewhere else next time. This may also be one of the better values hotel-wise, so factor than into your decision making and see if the location is worth sacrificing for the good deal. Just know that there will be times that you wont be able to get your car out of valet.

In my experience, most hotels do have a Starbucks or something similar. The Astor had a Dickie Brennan restaurant called Bourbon House, which looked really nice, but was expensive and not really an appropriate place for just a cup of coffee. One advantage to this hotel is it is on the right side of Canal Street for access to the French Quarter - it is right next to Bourbon Street.

If you are visiting New Orleans to check out the city... you can't do much better than this location. It's on the corner of Bourbon and Canal, so you will find this place to be right in the heart of the action and walking distance to most anything. Street band played every night we were there and man did they perform. Everything we expected and more. Lots of great restaurants nearby... my top recommendation is Drago's for their Chargrilled Oysters and Johnny's Po' Boys. You will find New Orleans is fairly expensive when it comes to food, but these two places are not only a good value, but have very good food. Try the Johnny's special po' boy... you'll thank me. Astor itself was nice... a little fancier than we like, but nice. Room was a good size and beds were extremely comfortable, but view was mostly of unattractive rooftops. Pool is small and more of a singles spot than a place to hang out with your kids (at least it was that way on our visit). My only complaint was the manditory valet parking. We were charged $32 a day for parking, not including a tip for the guys who retrieve your car. The garage is also 8 blocks away (from what I was told), and traffic is bad. I was thankful everytime that they brought my car in one piece. After we had checked-out and returned home, I made a call questioning a charge on my final bill which was handled quickly. However, the staff member I was talking to asked me about my stay and after complaining about the valet charges... she told me there is a nearby lot that I could have used with $4 daily charges.

You just have to take your laptop to the lobby, get a signal, and go back to your room, and you're good for 24 hours.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located right on Canal and Bourbon. Within minutes, you could walk to Harrah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the mall, or the French Quarter. The most important aspect of any business is location, location, and location. In fact, if it were not for its location (and assuming everything else stays the same), this hotel would not survive very long. First and foremost, the hotel charges $30 per day for valet parking. Let me reiterate: $30/day for valet. Now, what would you expect for valet service? Would you expect to be able to drop your car off with a valet and have them take your car away and bring it back to you when you want it? Well, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get half of that. You see, dropping it off isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the problem. The valet will gladly let you unload your car and then take it away on your behalf. Now when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to pick up your car and head home, herein lies the problem. You first must locate a valet to give your valet ticket to. This is a chore of itself. These valets are scattered all around with no central point of contact. After locating a valet and giving them your ticket, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll now spend the next 25 minutes waiting...and waiting...and waiting...for a bus. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, a bus will come and pick you and several other hotel patrons up (about 12 of you can fit on the bus) and whisk you away to...to...to... a public lot. You now exit the bus on to the lot and now must locate another group of valets to ask for your keys (no identification of ownership of automobile required; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the honor system that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pointing to your own car). After obtaining your keys, you load up your car and get ready to exit the lot. Think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over? Not quite yet. You see, if your car happens to be blocked in by another car, you simply wait for the other car to leave or flag down the valet again and ask them to move the car(s) blocking you in. After that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done, now you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re finally ready to leave New Orleans and head home. I timed myself from the moment I checked out in the front lobby to when I actually got into my car on my smart phone: 35 minutes. This did not include the wait once I got into my car needing other cars to be moved so that I could exit the lot. If this sounds frustrating to you just to get your car, try doing all of this, outside in the pouring rain. The public lot where you are to find a valet with your keys, find your vehicle, and load up your vehicle is all outdoors and uncovered. Now the hotel calls this valet service. Does it sound like valet service to you? Go to the Sheraton, or Wyndham hotel (both located a block or two away). Watch how efficient their valet service is. They actually bring your car to you within minutes! Imagine that! In fact, every hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at with valet service does that. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget what I stated earlier: you are paying $30/day for this so-called valet service. Do yourself a favor, use the Sheraton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valet service a block away. You do not have to be staying at the Sheraton to use their valet service. You can pay for your valet service when you leave. Customers of Sheraton get the convenience of paying it all at the end (if they take their cars out multiple times) or have it billed to the room. Just carry/roll your suitcase or luggage with you to the Crown Astor from the Sheraton. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be paying the same price but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get your car sooner, delivered right to you, anytime you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like. Or you can find a public lot, stash your car there, and just hit up a cab back to the Crown Astor. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll save yourself a big headache.

Since the conference covered my 10th year anniversary, I had my wife join me two days in the conference.I stayed at the hotel a total of 7 days. First I will cover the Good. The location. The French Quarter! Hotel right on Canal and Bourbon St. If you like Bourbon Street and the musician this is cool, if you have trouble sleeping and are easily waken...oops. Not the hotel for you. A street band plays right outside the hotel each night. Nice lobby, but small with little seating. The A/C works well in the hotel, perhaps a little cold, but you will appreciate a good A/C in New Orleans in August. Front desk staff was nice and helpful, they were attractive, but not outgoing. The beds were first class. I didn't look under them and I did not care too. Door men will help with luggage and hailing cabs. Not So Good: Biggest Gripe, the hotel does not have microwaves or a fridge as standards. They do not even have microwaves available at ALL! I booked my room, months in advance, but when I arrived the fridge was not in my room and there were non available. Also, the upcharge to request a fridge was $25. Later that day, they did bring a fridge. They do have ice on every floor, but with the heat, cold water is a must. They feed you well in NOLA so it was disappointing they did not offer microwaves or any place to re-heat good grub! The room was nice, but it is time for them to refresh them. The carpet was bad...visibly dirty. Paying for internet??? This should be reserved for the Super 8, wait I think they provide free internet. Free internet should be a no-brainer. Finally, I had some documents sent to me next day to review for my next trip. They arrived on 8/3, I though they were not sent and a partner called his assistant to verify, but did not call back. The day before I checked out, I got a call that I had a package waiting for me. It was 8/8. The lady at the business center apologized, and it left me little time to prepare. Other Comments: Room size was average. The conference rooms were average. The view from my room on the 12 floor was lame. That is the point with the Astor Crown Plaza, it felt like a standard Marriott Hotel, not like the Ritz-Charles down the street.

The 2 best things about this hotel are the location and the service. It is located right on the corner of Canal and Bourbon street - centrally located to everything in the French Quarter. Keep in mind that you are right on Bourbon street - great for walking anywhere, but be prepared for the noise and somewhat sleazy characters you are likely to encounter immediately outside your hotel - par for the course on Bourbon street. I stayed in the newer tower, and the lobby and rooms were quite nice - I would say above average for other Crowne Plaza properties I've stayed in. The front desk staff, housekeeping, and concierge were all professional and very helpful. There is a Dickie Brennan restaurant on site (The Bourbon House) and it served the best oysters I've eaten in 20 years, a nice place, still not sure why the lobby bar closed so early, though (probably to avoid the inevitable drunken walk-ins after 11:00). A couple of notes: the website says they have airport transportation, but all they do is refer you to a private airport shuttle service that charges $20 each way and makes numerous stops - consider taking a cab, for $10 additional you get door-door service. Valet parking is a challenge, always hectic, at 1 point they had you board a shuttle and then took you to the parking garage - how exactly does that qualify as \"valet\"? At $31/day, I expect them to bring me my car. The valet fee was more than I paid for my rental car. I returned the rental and saved money by using cabs and trolleys. If you're just visiting for the French Quarter and Downtown, you don't need a car.

Two random bystanders were shot just outside the hotel door that opens out on to Bourbon Street on the Fri night we were there around 11 p.m. When I spoke to the hotel manager about this the next morning, he informed me that the intersection of Canal & Bourbon (just outside the hotel's front door!) was one of the most dangerous areas in New Orleans and that crime there was a very common occurance! If that is known, we wondered (and asked) why the hotel didn't have security there or why there wasn't more of a police presence...to which we got no answer.

Our bellhop Eric was very friendly and funny, and had us laughing all the way up to our room on the 12th floor. We had a king room on the Bourbon Street side, with a great view of Bourbon and Canal street. The only noise we heard were the sounds of the brass band during the day that would play right on the corner of Bourbon and Canal. And even then it was not very loud, just the faint sounds of horns and cymbals. They did provide a little care package with linen spray and ear plugs, but we never had to use them. The room was immaculate! We were told that all the mattresses had been recently replaced, and all the rooms now had flat screen TV's. (Last year our room had a tube TV, so this was a great improvement). The bed was very high but extremely comfortable. The room was free of dust, and the air conditioning was great. It kept the room at a comfortable temperature at all times, which is a must because of the heat and humidity in New Orleans during the summer months. Bathroom was spotless with no visible signs of mold, or mildew anywhere. Towels were always plentiful and the water pressure in the shower was amazing. Housekeeping always respected our privacy. Most days we would be out of the room on the late side, around 2:00 or 3:00pm. They never knocked, and we always came back to a spotless room. Let them an excellent tip for their excellent services. We ate at the hotel's restaurant Bourbon House for lunch and dinner a few times. Great food and superb service. I loved the fact that late at night everyone was required to show their room key to gain entry into the hotel. Being so close to Bourbon Street, and with so many people out and about, it just gave an added sense of security to take such measures. We did not make it to the pool or gym this time around, but I do remember them both being adequate when I stayed at the hotel last year. We did not have a car, so we had no issues with valet parking. It's so easy to walk in New Orleans, take a cab, or ride the street car. The hotel is beautiful, clean, and well maintained. All the staff that we encountered were friendly and willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs. New Orleans is a great city, so rich in culture, art, history, music, food, and fun. Be sure to have breakfast at Brennans, it truly is a wonderful experience. Don't miss out on great eats at Acme Oyster House, Deanie's, Court of the two Sisters, Red Fish Grill, and a Hurricane at Pat O Brians.

I do not like to write these sorts of letters, and I write them infrequently, but my stay at the Astor Crowne in New Orleans was so horrific that I feel compelled to let you know. I arrived Friday, June 24 for the ALA convention. The good news: a room was available before noon and I checked in. The bad news: the carpet was wet -- someone had obviously cleaned it and it hadn't dried. I spent a couple of hours in the room, left for business, and when I returned after dinner, the stench in the room was unbearable. It was as if someone had left laundry in a washing machine for 4 day and everything had mildewed. I called downstairs, and I was moved to another room. The bellman agreed with me that the odor was unbearable. So far so good. I went about my business on Saturday, came back in the late afternoon, and found a number of tiny black \"objects\" among my sheets. They were not alive, but they looked a lot like bed bugs to me. I called downstairs -- everyone came up, including the hotel engineer, housekeeping, and the head bellman. They weren't sure what the objects were but agreed I should move to another room. I moved to my third room a few minutes later. The air conditioning was broken. So was the hair dryer. And the keys didn't work. I checked out Sunday morning. As far as I am concerned, this was the hotel from hell. I am an experienced traveler, and I am not particularly demanding, but this was beyond the pale. And, when I brought it up to the front desk manager, he said they had inspected both rooms and didn't find anything wrong with them. Not a good thing to say to a customer who is on Facebook and Twitter. He did apologize but made no effort to compensate me for the two days of misery.

Checked in Friday, 6/3, 2 nights. Checking process was smooth with front-desk staff polite and helpful (though surprisingly unknowledgeable about the surrounding Burbon St. area). The two staff members seemed to have a lengthy discussion about the fact that the reservation was prepaid via the online service rather than booked with the chain itself. I've seen this before and wonder if rooms of lesser quality are given to those who book via low-cost-providers. Bellman was helpful with luggage and courteous. Booked an \"executive king\" room at an extra cost beyond a lower-tier room (standard or deluxe). We were told these were on the 4'th floor where the 'executive lounge' is located (more on this later). The room was clean and well supplied with towels, toiletries, etc. However, the furnishings were dated (think 1980 Las Vegas) and the furniture lacking (there was one chair in the room and it was a plush, red barrell type). the bed was quite cmofortable with nice, good-quality linens. There was one tiny window in the room and it was about 6 feet away from the exterior brick wall of an adjacent building. I was very surprised the more expensive rooms were not on a higher floor - see above comment about booking via online service. Interestingly, a pair of ear plugs was supplied in the room; we found out why with loud street noise at 7am. The bathroom was a little small and cramped but otherwise decent - there was a makeup mirror and hair-dryer supplied. The Executive lounge is not worth whatever extra money it costs. There are a few sofas and chairs with a television and bar. The first drink is free but anything beyond that must be paid in cash. Light snacks are provided in the evenings - cheese cubes, carrot sticks, post-stickers, etc., and continental-breakfast provided in the mornings. The hours are very limited - breakfast ending and the door locked at 10:00 am on Sunday, for example. Given the proximity of some of the best dining in the nation a few steps away this is really a waste. The best feature of the property is it's location at Bourbon @ Canal. Virtually anywhere you would want to go in the city is within walking distance or a short cab ride. (Note- this is New Orleans and as you would expect the crowd outside might seem a little rough to some late at night; I never felt uncomfortable, though.) The concierge was of moderate help in arranging a tour - clearly they receive a kickback from some tour companies over others. we did not visit the rooftop pool but it's visible from the lounge. it's quite small with a few lounge chairs surrounding it.

I was extremely disappointed in most aspects of my 5 day stay. The room was in poor condition due to age and wear - most likely due to the location near Bourbon Street. The bathroom wasn't clean (brown spots on light fixture that have been there for quite some time). The last night of my stay I arrived back at my room to find it hadn't been completely cleaned during the day. Dirty cups in the sink, room hadn't been vacuumed, brown water in the toilet, etc. The phone in my room didn't work - I had to call the front desk from my cell phone to request a wake-up call. I tried to be pleasant about my room problems, commenting on the non-functional phone, thinking it would motivate someone to fix it - it didn't. Employees were complacent about issues I was having in my room. I don't mind paying for parking, but WiFi???? Get over it Crowne Plaza - most other hotels provide internet for free especially for long time loyalty members. The mattresses are old, hard and need to be replaced. The hotel basically put the bed frame on \"stilts\" to give the appearance of a pillow-top, as I found out when I tried to move the bed to plug in my lap-top and the frame fell off the \"stilts\". When putting the bed back together I found what appeared to be dried vomit on the dust ruffle. Yeah. My favorite experience - the missing protective mesh screen on the hair drier air intake. It sucked my hair into it - I couldn't turn it off and the hair drier finally shorted out. My hair was literally smoking. I couldn't get it out of the hair drier, couldn't move away from the drier due to the fact it was hard-wired into the wall. I finally had to break my hair a few strands at a time to get free - it took about 10 minutes. I stopped by the front desk to tell the attendant I needed a new hair drier and why I needed a new drier......she swiped a card and gave me a free breakfast on the executive floor for my trouble. Nice. I don't eat breakfast. Maintenance replaced the hair drier while I was at dinner, but left the discarded screws on the floor of the bathroom - I stepped on one with my bare foot. Ouch. Checking out I explained the hair drier situation to the desk clerk and did receive one night free stay and the internet charges were taken off my bill. Since this was a business trip it benefited the company I work for, not me, for the trauma I experienced (smoking hair stuck in hair drier). My best experience was the parking garage valets- they were all terrific., and the room service waitress. They deserve raises as they are friendly and helpful. I would strongly suggest you find another accommodation if staying in New Orleans. The Crowne Plaza Astor was at one time a very nice hotel, but you can do better for the money you pay.

Let me say that the location of this hotel is the best. Located at the corner of Canal and Bourbon Street, it offers instant access to the French Quarter and all the fun and uniqueness it has to offer. We enjoyed the proximity to the Quarter and to the Central Business District. We were able to walk to the Arena for the games, (about a 20 minute walk), since the cab ride there was $20 --no, it is not that far, they charged a special events fee. Lobby was very pretty and very clean. The marble floors had a very nice shine to them. Our room was located on the Bourbon Street side of the hotel. I have seen some complaints about the noise but neither my husband and I, nor our friends, found this to be a problem. Also, the hotel is located right across the street from a drugstore, and a McDonald's is close by. (Tthe horrible service and attitude of the staff at McDonald's is a whole other review.) There are also a lot of souvenir shops, restaurants and other stores nearby. Ladies, there is a Nine West Outlet store across the street and I must say that the prices were not too bad. The staff was very friendly and helpful. In my experience they understand that tourism is their bread and butter and they acted accordingly. Not at anytime was any staff member rude or unwilling to help us. The staff even suggested the best way to get around New Orleans and where to go. One of the waiters in the restaurant told us the best places to visit and hang out (He actually offered to go with us, but we did not take up that invite). Room was clean and functional. It suited our needs very well. Room service ordered once, and it was delivered in a timely manner. I can say that for the price, this was a wonderful hotel choice. If you like the Ritz, it's down the street and you can visit the lobby. Downside, not all the rooms had flat screen tv's as advertised. I didn't care, since we didn't watch a lot of tv in the room, but if you advertise the feature, you should deliver it. The hotel bar is very small, and the drink a bit pricey, but they don't stint on the liquor, and being on the corner of Bourbon Street, going elsewhere to get drinks was easy (and I didn't go to any restaurant/bar where anyone was light on the liquor, like many tourist areas). Hotel restaurant had decent food, service a bit slow, but once we got seated and waited on, things improved greatly from there.

It doesn't seem like they're a full service travel agency, as they were unable or unwilling to help us when we had a problem. We picked the 4-star 4-diamond Mystery Hotel, and pretty sure those ratings are from the early 80s. We arrived to a not-so-clean room, and a ton of noise. There's numerous carpet stains, and what looks to be chips in the porcelain (or plastic more likely) of the tub, and a few disconcerting stains in the tub as well. The walls in this place are very thin, so you can easily hear your neighbors' conversations and every time they use the sink/toilet/shower. The hotel is also on the corner of Bourbon Street, so you get to listen to the music blasting from some of the clubs all night too. We had originally asked for a king sized bed on a higher floor, but got two queens on a low floor. When I brought this up with the front desk, they didn't seem to care, and essentially left me with \"the hotel is on Bourbon Street, so what did you expect?\" Well, I expected my requests to be at least considered, the staff to be helpful, and my room to be neat and tidy. As for the noise, maybe you should install double paned glass or more insulation so guests don't hear everything going on next door and 5 floors below. At the very least, clearly state on your website and any place you advertise that it's a noisy property. To top it all off, the showers seem to be pumping out maybe a gallon an hour, so you're left with a trickle of soft water. Have fun trying to get shampoo and soap off with that. I don't know if the soft water is a New Orleans thing, but from my experience at some of the bars and restaurants, it seems to be just a Crowne Plaza thing. So stop pumping water softener into your water, and dial up your pressure while you're at it. Lesson learned: don't stay on Bourbon street, and remember that Crowne Plaza hotels don't seem to have received updates in a few decades. Go with a boutique hotel (some in the area looked very cool) or one of the bigger brands that has a little more cache (and deeper pockets to keep their properties up to date).

That said, if we had had to stay longer, we would have moved to a different hotel. My wife and tween daughter stayed at the Astor on a Saturday night, ahead of a cruise departing the next afternoon. I am a Priority Club Platnium member, and chose this hotel based on reviews here, the location, and the fact that the Intercontinental was full for the weekend. This was my first visit to New Orleans, and my lack of knowledge certainly aided in my poor choice of hotels. The location is great, IF rpt IF you want to be on Bourbon Street and you came to party. Located directly on the corner of Bourbon and Canal, you could not be closer to the \"action.\" Upon entering the lobby, I was greeted by multiple groups of twenty-somethings all drinking and acting like it was pledge week. I was not familiar with New Orleans' open container laws. Upon check-in, I asked if an upgrade was available -- given my Platinum status. I was told she could move me to the 12th foor, \"away from the noise.\" I was also told my room card would allow us access to the Executive lounge. The ride up in the elevator was surrounded by more people in various stages of intoxication -- and it was barely 5:00pm. The room was nice, but standard fare. There was still an ancient looking 25-inch tube TV with poor reception -- you had to wiggle the coax cable to get the picture in clearly. The room overlooked Bourbon street. The bathroom was showing it's age, with rust covering the back of the magnifying mirror and the shower flange hanging loose from the wall. The only part of ths hotel I can recommend is the concierge. He was VERY helpful, and went out of his way to help us. He advised us that the \"city was full,\" with a couple conventions in town (not at this hotel, but eating up rooms in the city). He got us a table at Arnaud's for dinner, and gave us some advise for seeing some sights after an early dinner. He warned us to avoid Bourbon street after 9:00pm; he really should have said to avoid it after 6:00pm. On our way to dinner, aside from the slew of strip joints (a Hustler club is directly across from the Bourbon Street entrance to this hotel), there were men up on a balcony exposing themselves. This of course is NOT the hotel's fault, but I write to give fair warning on the neighboorhood. The biggest problem with this hotel is the NOISE! We were on the 12th floor, but the noise from Bourbon Street below was incredible, and it went on ALL NIGHT -- literally. The hotel provides a SINGLE sweet dreams welcome bag per room, which had earplugs and a sleep mask. The three of us fought over who got the earplugs. As it was, we all had a miserable night of sleep. There were also multiple episodes of people coming back to their rooms late in the night, and making a lot of noise. I thought I was back in a dorm. We woke early, and decided to go to the Executive lounge for breakfast. My flashback to a college dorm was solidified when I opened our door and saw overturn pizza slices laying on the carpet outside our room. A couple doors down, and blue, inflated condom was tied to the door knob and a couple beer cans lay on the floor. Outside the elevator was a large wet spot and foul odor...I can only surmise what happened there. When we got to the lounge, the door was propped open and there was no one checking keys. Perhaps because of this, the lounge was overflowing with guests, of which I'm not sure how many were really supposed to be there. Many of them were clearly hung over -- or still drunk. The breakfast was passable, but they were out of most sliverware and the tables were dirty and not bussed. Our concierge friend saved the morning, and booked us a city tour. As I said, he is the only redeeming factor to this hotel. At this point, I was not surprised at all, when we returned around noon, and rode up to our room to check out, that the elevator was full of people already holding open beer cans. Another thing that surprised me was the inability to check out via the TV. Also, getting a cab outside the hotel to reach the pier was very chaotic, with buses arriving and the valets trying to deliver cars, etc. As noted, I am a very loyal Priority Club member, but I cannot recommend the Astor for anyone not looking for Bourbon Street debauchery or a flashback to a college frat party.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gahanna, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBest get away in YEARS, due to great staff and Don in particular.\u201d", "Author": "OhioBE", "ReviewID": "UR104026634", "Content": "This review is long overdue, and for that, fellow travelers, I apologize. My fiance and I took our first real getaway in 5 years to visit New Orleans, a locale I'd wanted to visit since I was young. We stayed from 12/1/10 - 12/5/10, during an unusually chilly time for NOLA. I cannot compliment enough the staff and obvious pride they have in their positions at the Astor. The people always make the place, and this hotel is no exception. I would return if only to see them! We did pick a season that was lower traffic and did not valet (thanks much to our booking person's advice, we didn't need to rent a car at all - see my notation on what a city block in NOLA really is, lol). Thus, did not experience any of the frustrations other travelers have listed. What we did encounter was a very speedy check-in, despite a later hour of arrival. The lobby was absolutely BEAUTIFULLY decorated for the holiday season with an enormous Christmas tree and other trimmings. It set the tone for our holiday trip. Sadly, I couldn't put work aside. However I did spend about 4 hours each day in the lobby utilizing the free wi-fi (and sipping on my complimentary rum punch *shhhhh* ). During this time, a children's choir visited the hotel to carol- it was such a nice touch. These little things, like the hotel supporting local arts showcasing, make it special. Be sure to check out the sugared Mardi Gras themed sculptures in the lobby as well. I was able to stay on the quiet floor -which I very much appreciated. The beds were fantastic- we did experience a small issue with the plastic support as others have, but my 'hubby' was able to pretty much quick-fix it. Don responded to other reviews that all box springs and supports should be fully replaced by April 2011. On each pillow, there was a care packet with a sleeping mask, pillow spray and ear plugs. I can see where this might come in handy during Mardi Gras or other peak season festivities. But with the fantastic location at Canal and Bourbon, my goodness, what do people expect of the noise level? That's part of the experience, right, ma chere? On any account, it was a lovely touch. We watched our first parade right outside the hotel - the Jingle Crewe. It was great and something to experience. It was certainly a community effort - I think that's what strikes me the most about NOLA - there is a palpable sense of community, one that welcomes everyone from everywhere. Incidentally, we met the Mayor of NOLA who also upheld our overall impression of community and welcome. NOLA should have an ever brightening future under his guidance. Here's something I learned: when someone tells you a location is 7 to 12 blocks away, it's about a quarter mile. I was expecting big city blocks and a huge walk. You can walk so very easily to the French Quarter and the Aquarium/Casino area. About a 12 min walk in either direction. If you are remotely physically able, you can meander just about anywhere in your own good time. Our room was IMMACULATE. As an asthmatic, this was acutely important to me. Molds/mildew hit me *really* badly - my mother (a senior citizen now) actually was upset that I was going to a damp, humid area of the US because I'm \"going to land in the hospital and you don't want to ruin your trip, do you?\" You know mothers! Still, a valid concern. Absolutely no problems. Room was spacious, TV was great. Bathroom was perfect. We used the in-room safe quite a bit for my jewelry, electronics and cash. It worked out great! We did have to watch the hotel room door, sometimes it didn't close all the way - just open it and close it again. It's something in the digital lock system and has happened to me at other establishments. Just check twice before leaving. Housekeeping is early - but that's how hotels function. It's not atypical across the US. If we asked for more time, they returned in about 90 min. Perfect for me. The concierge service was fantastic, and quick to give insider advice. That's what we like! One of the concierge gentlemen actually flies from Atlanta to work weekends at the Astor. He transplanted after Katrina, but keeps coming back! That's what I mean when I mention pride and dedication! The value is great - I certainly couldn't swing the top price for a Mardi Gras experience but really, REALLY wish I could. I hear you can utilize the hotel balcony for parades! And, I'm too old to split a room with four people to amortize the cost, lol. So winter visits it must be... unless I can find FAB flight rates and land a decently priced room as well sometime during slower months in the summer. Don obviously takes great pride and satisfaction from a job well done. I'm almost glad I wasn't able to post back sooner (read my \"jumping the gun\" earlier post) because it meant I was able to read through his comments and service responses. I really am floored at his PR and customer relations acumen. The hotel has a huge asset in him. One thing I would love to see - some sort of brochure or check-in packet insert, or wall hanging in the lobby, that outlines the history of the building. I believe the Astor used to be a Woolworth that caused quite a bit of controversy due to violating building height regulations with its number of floors at the time of construction. I love having a sense of 'where I am,' if you know what I mean. History also makes a place special. With best regards, gratitude and true appreciation, Jessica Hamlin & J.

So if you are a light sleeper may want to watch this. We did not hear any street noise though. My biggest complaint is with housekeeping. They knocked on the door at 7:45 am and asked if we needed anything. We were still asleep. My son said no. The maid then handed him a piece of paper and asked him to sign it. I could hear the whole conversation. She did not explain to him what it was. He signed it. He and I assumed it was some sort of customer service check. No! We were signing off on getting our room cleaned! No towels, didnt take the trash, make the bed! Nothing! I have never had this happen before. I have stayed at a LOT of hotels, and usually when you answer the door still in your pjs, they apologize and return later. It was not like we were sleeping til noon or anything! The big kicker is when we returned that day and asked the front desk to have our room cleaned she said ok- only to return that night with no towels. Called once again- no answer- went downstairs and talked to front desk. Assured me someone would come. Again- 1 hour later- no one! It was ridiculous! I finally called and was not so nice! I demanded towels, soap, shampoo, etc... A very sweet young boy delivered our supplies. In exchange I gave him our trash and dirty towels. I must say this was quite ridiculous. I think they need to rethink their procedure or retrain their staff. The restaurant downstairs provided good food. Slightly pricey, but it was very good. Parking is expensive- I believe it was 31.00 per day. But the valet staff were very friendly and got your car for you as quickly as possible.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cWorked out very well.

I am a local business professional and had a free two night stay that I received as a raffle prize from a local golf tournament. Upon checking in, the valet staff was friendly and instructed us to call down about 15 minutes before we needed our vehicle. That evening we phoned the valet desk several times and did not get an answer. So I called the front desk and they made arrangements to get our vehicle so that we could go do dinner. We dropped our car off that evening and had no issues. Early the next morning I phoned down ahead of time as I was instructed to upon check in, no one answered the phone again at the valet!!!! So I called the front desk and was told very rudely that \"I needed to come down and get my own car\" So, I hung up and called back to try and speak to someone else. After the person picked the phone up and didn't answer and tried to connect me to valet I went downstairs. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was looked at like I was crazy and was told there are no supervisors!!! Terrible feeling when the hotel has your car keys and your credit card number and you cannot do anything to get it!!! At this point I noticed that part of the valet staff was hanging around the front desk, and I said to this person \"maybe that's why no one answered the phone because you are hanging out up here\"!!! after this the valet attendant told me \"it wasn't his job to answer the phone\", and I replied \"way to be a team player\"!! After not getting my through to this individual he was ready to actually fight me. It's 8:00 on a Saturday morning and this guy working at the hotel is trying to pick a fight with a guest! Quality individual!!!! At this point I am concerned about my safety...what is this guy going to do, no managers around, no supervisors around so what the heck! I can do whatever I want!!

As others have said, the location is superb and the balcony served as a welcome respite from the crowds to watch the parade. We had no issues with noise whatsoever. At times, I could hear the revelry outside but it was a faint 'we need to get out there' noise, not a 'good gawd, doesn't anyone sleep in this town' type of noise. We booked a triple room, and the room was indeed fantastic. Beds were beautifully made up with lots of extra pillows, giving the room a very regal look. We were given a linen bag containing earplugs, an eye mask and a linen spray. First quibble - we were only given one bag per room....for a triple room. I flagged down a Housekeeping lady and she confirmed that yes, there is only one welcome bag per room. Are we supposed to share earplugs and eye masks?? At almost $300 a night for a triple room during Mardi Gras weekend, I found this to be very nickle and dimeish. The bathroom was very nicely appointed, but the water pressure was weak, there was no air vent and I couldn't help being weirded out by the fact that the coffeee maker, coffee etc were located in the corner of the bathroom countertop. Coffee pot in the bathroom?? I thought it was just me until my friends commented on it as well. Quibble number 2. I decided to phone the front desk to let them know that the rest of my party would be getting in very late. As I have done in every other hotel I've stayed in, I turned to my bedside table to dial only to realize that there was only one phone in the room and it was across the room on the desk. I'm sure this sounds like nitpicking but I was kind of surprised. It's one of those things you don't really notice until you're exhausted and already laying down. There are ALWAYS phones on the bedside table! (Quibble #3). So I get to the lone phone and press the button that says 'Front Desk'. Someone answers and tells me I've reached Housekeeping. Figuring I'd misdialed, I do it again. Same thing. I finally asked the lady if I should press 'Housekeeping' to get the Front Desk. We shared a laugh over that one. She gave me the number for the front desk and I finally got through to them but I had to keep the number on a pad near the phone. (Quibble #4) Room Service was fantastic! No quibbles here. Prompt, excellent quality and the staff was very courteous. The Creole Potato Salad is to die for! It is expensive by the time you factor in delivery, tax and the built in gratuity, but it was worth it when we just couldn't be bothered to brave the Bourbon St crowds. Wanted to store some water and soda but there is no mini-bar and no refrigerator in the room (Quibble #5). Even lower end hotels have a refrigerator. Housekeeping staff is great. Never had to ask for anything. They work hard and do a great job. I will say that there is only one small trashcan in the bathroom and another small one in the room itself. These fill up pretty quickly and we ended having to swap out bags ourselves. Crowne Plaza, either add another can or make the lone trashcan in the room bigger please. The balcony is awesome. We went up to view the parade and I ordered a rum and coke, which took forever to come. We were ready to leave and it still hadn't arrived so I flagged the girl down to cancel it and, considering she still didn't have the drinks with her, she agreed. The drink was still charged to my room ($15.38 by the time they added delivery charges and tax). I called the front desk the morning I checked out and was assured it would be removed, but it was still there when I looked at my charges online. I had to call the hotel again when I got back to New York. It was eventually removed so I was happy about that. There is a full service business center where I sent a fax (at $3.00 for the first page and $2.00 every additional page, thank you very much), but there is also a room in the lobby where there are computers for use free of charge. You can even print. I loved that and it came in very handy for printing our boarding passes before we left. $9.95 a day for wifi just wasn't worth it when I could just run down to the lobby for a few mins. The Bourbon House restaurant attached to the hotel is awesome! Had my first try of alligator there and loved it. The Crowne Plaza also offers coupons for a 10% discount at Oceana Grill nearby. Their 'lost bread' and alligator sausage are to die for and the blackened bayou duck is sinful. Great good all around. Re tours, we booked a river cruise from the concierge in the lobby who told us we had to be there by 2pm. We got there at 2 only to find that the boat had left at 1:30 lol. We still had all the flyers where he wrote 'be there at 2pm'. Not to be deterred, we just jumped on line down at the dock and booked a cruise on the Natchez that was leaving at 2:30pm. We hadn't paid a deposit so it all worked out. All in all, we had a really good time in New Orleans, and a big part of that was due to the Astor Crowne. The location can't be beat, the people are friendly, the restaurants are great and I appreciated the security measures in place during Mardi Gras. We were issued ID bands and they were checked relentlessy. I would recommend staying here if you get a good rate but I think there are enough things that take away from its 5-star status to diminish the value of what we paid.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tuscaloosa, AL", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Place to Stay in New Orleans\u201d", "Author": "jtwatson3606", "ReviewID": "UR101141625", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights and had a wonderful trip.

If you're going for Mardi Gras (next year), many of the parades pass directly in front of the hotel and you can watch the parade from the street level or on the hotel's balcony (on one night the balcony was closed for a private party attended by Melissa Leo and other cast members of the show \"Treme\"). I was very happy with the check-in process, especially when I noticed they gave us a room in the 12th-floor Quiet Zone as I requested when I reserved the room online (a lot of hotels don't pay much attention to those requests). This is to avoid being kept up all night by the sounds of Bourbon St. The room was very nice. The biggest thing I noticed that was missing was a minibar but there was a vending machine and ice machine down the corridor and staff never stopped us from bringing drinks/food up to the room. Btw, room service food was delicious. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable.

It is close enough to the French Quarter without all the noise. We got a room on the 9th floor so noise wasn't a factor for us. Every night during our stay, there was a group of musicians playing Jazz/Blues music on Bourbon St just a few feet away from its side entrance. They attracted a fairly large crowd. We could barely hear them from our room but could be noisy for those on the lower floors. The hotel did provide ear plugs, lavender linen spray and eye masks to help you to sleep but we didn't have the need to use them. It is also easily accessible to the lines for the cable cars. The stops are directly across on Canal Street. It is close to shops and several fast food restaurants. We got a room with double queen beds. The room size is adequate. The mattresses were very comfortable. They weren't too hard or too soft. The linens were nice & clean. There were questionable large stains on the bed skirt but I wasn't as concerned since it weren't the linens on the beds. I would be if it had. As space is a premium based on its location. I thought it was ridiculous that the hotel was charging $31.50/a night for parking so needless to say we didn't use their valet parking service. We found a covered parking garage only a few minutes walk from the hotel for $15/night with a guard on duty and security cameras. There is a business center with 3 computers and a printer. Free internet in the lobby & business center but there is a charge of $9.95/night in your room. There is a pool but it was outside and not heated so it was too cold to swim.

I booked the room through an online site, and believe I paid $99 per night for what was advertised as a \"totally renovated, 4 star hotel.\" Now, for paying $99 per night, which I felt was a reasonably good price, the hotel met the standards of a hotel under $100 a night. The location is fantastic and most people I encountered at the hotel were friendly and helpful. However, the hotel classifies itself as a 4 star, which it is not, and the room rate on the back of my door was listed at approx. $465, which would be extremely inappropriate.

The negative's: -Upon check in around 9:35 PM, I requested a room high up as I was there for work and needed to get some sleep. The receptionist said no problem. She promptly handed me keys to a room on the 3rd floor. I asked if they didn't have anything higher, so she gave me a room on the 4th floor. -The room on the 4th floor was F-I-L-T-H-Y. There was sugar or some white substance all over the desk, the floor throughout the room was sticky and immediately turned my feet black, the bathroom was not clean, my alarm clock was broken, the in-room blow dryer was broken, the entire room smelled and felt really musty, and the closet was tiny with no mirror on the door. I wiped down the desk myself, and started unpacking because I figured I just got a bad room because I had booked through an online discount site. I was going to leave a note for the maid the following day, with a gratuity, asking her to please really clean the room. But, the one thing I couldn't deal with is a broken hair dryer as I need one in the morning so, I called down to the front desk to ask for a new one. I called 4 separate times that evening, between 9:45 and 10:30, and no one answered. The phone just rang and rang and rang. Eventually, I gave up and went to bed, figuring I will deal with it first thing. -Called the front desk the following morning at 5:30 to ask for a new blow dryer. The receptionist said they have none, and would send up maintenance. A 4-star hotel doesn't have extra's? I would have to wait for maintenance to fix what was clearly a fried blow dryer? You could see the burn on the exterior of the device. I waited until 6:20 with no one coming to my room, and called the front desk again. Surprise, no one answered the phone. Called again, and no one answered. Great service. Quite frustrating when you are trying to get ready to leave for the day. -Went down to the front desk, explained what happened, and that there was a reason I was up at the crack of down in New Orleans. I needed to get on with my business meetings! I then took the opportunity to explain that the room was also really dirty, to which the receptionist responded \"You should have called the front desk upon check-in last night.\" Not a good response considering the numerous attempts I had made to contact the front desk. -Eventually, she agreed to switch me to a room right next door in order to solve the broken dryer issue, and to get me into a cleaner room. So, at 6:45 AM I had to move all of my belongings to a new room while scurrying to get ready in order to get to my business meetings. The new room was much, much better. It was clean, didn't smell, all electronics worked, was larger, had a full sized closet with mirror on the door, some additional amenities my first room didn't have, etc. I was really happy with the move. I went down and thanked the receptionist for the accommodation. I most appreciated it! Still, I didn't get a paper delivered to my door 2 of the 4 nights I was there, didn't receive my check-out bill for my last night (on personal credit card) under the door, my dirty room service plates & tray sat outside my door for 12+hours even after someone who had apparently had one too many hurricanes ran into it and scattered the dishes throughout the hallway, and the maid service forgot to leave coffee in my room one day. As I said, for paying $99 a night, it is a perfectly fine deal & hotel. I didn't feel like I overpaid and would consider staying here again for work, if I could get the same rate. I used the fitness center every day, spent a couple of hours by the pool one afternoon, loved the location, and felt perfectly safe traveling all alone.

The location of it is great if you want to be right by Bourbon Street. And although it's an old hotel, it has been renovated and is in pretty good shape inside. The thing that will never take me back to the hotel though is the valet service. YES, it's really that bad!! There's no parking anywhere around the hotel so you have no choice but to valet park. I knew that going in, but figured the hotel would have adequate staff to handle everyone. When we arrived on Friday night we had to wait for at least half an hour before we could even get close to the front of the hotel. This gave us the chance to watch all of the drunk people stumbling from Bourbon Street, which would be a common sight day and night in front of the hotel. Finally \"Big John\" came to my window and helped us unload our luggage onto a cart. Big John was wonderful. We got inside, check-in was quick, and we were off to our room. The room was nice for an older hotel. Not much drawer space or table top space though. We didn't have any problems with noise, but our room was on the inside of the hotel. I heard that the rooms on lower floors that faced the outside of the hotel could be noisy (Bourbon Street noise). I was told that I could call down to the valet stand and they would get my car in about 10-15 minutes. So the next morning I tried to call down to the valet stand to request my car be brought up. I got a recording that said due to valet being so busy, I'd have to go downstairs and request my car. So off we went and in about 20 minutes my car arrived. This was a good day for valet service, let me tell you, because it was never this good again. Only down side was that one of the guys left his empty Powerade bottle in my car. Nice...I have to clean up their trash in my car now. Everytime we returned to the hotel, traffic was backed up out front. There is really no place for the cars to go and Crowne doesn't have enough staff to handle the volume of cars that come in and out of the hotel. So we had to sit and wait, and wait, and wait, each time. And the valet guys don't come to you, you have to jump out of your car and try to stop one of them. So Sunday morning, I try again to call downstairs to request the car. I get the recorded message that I have to go downstairs. I get downstairs and am told that because it's a heavy checkout day, I have to wait for a shuttle that will take me to the off-site parking area where I can pick up my car. Seriously?? I'm paying you $31.50 a day for valet and I have to go get my own car? They said the shuttle would run every 7 minutes. It pulled up, I got on, we went to the offsite garage, and I had to wait there for one of the guys to go get my car. After I got my car I had to go back to the hotel and pick up the rest of our party. This actually worked pretty well however if I had been checking out and had luggage it wouldn't have been favorable. Monday morning - again, not able to call down and get the car. So we go downstairs. We needed to leave timely to get to a tour location, so I gave us 30 minutes. 45 minutes later I finally see our car coming. By this time, total frustration with these guys has set in and I was really having to hold my tongue. After all, I still had one more day of them taking care of my car! I get in the car, the seat has been completely readjusted and the radio has been turned completely off. I had turned the volume down when I got out the day before, but when I turn on the radio the station has been changed, and the volume cranked up. Gee...just make yourselves at home! Tuesday morning, it's finally time to leave. We went to breakfast and on our way back stopped at the valet stand to give them the ticket. We still had to go up and get our luggage, so I figured this would give them ample time to get my car pulled up. We load up the luggage, come back downstairs, and we wait. And we wait. And we wait!!! Finally after 45 minutes, \"Ro\" says he'll check and see what the hold up is. I followed him to the valet stand because I wanted to hear what was going on. The guys at the offsite garage never heard Ro when he requested my car. Ro tells them to make my car the next one that comes down. Almost another half hour goes by before my car finally arrives. One hour and 10 minutes after I requested it!!! And again, the radio station has been changed, seat completely readjusted. I can see needing to move the seat some, but changing the radio station and cranking it up? I'm sorry. This isn't your personal vehicle. So I basically have no big complaints about this hotel except for the valet service. But the valet service was so bad, that I would never stay here again. We were with a large group of people and we all experienced the same problems with valet. Complaints were made to management, but nothing ever got better. I understand that due to the location of the hotel and the volume of people coming in and out, it's not an ideal situation for these guys trying to work valet. But the number of staff seemed to be inadequate. Big John and Ro seemed to be the only 2 that even acted like they cared. The other valet staff just had an attitude...probably from getting chewed out so much and from working in such a bad situation.

It's New Orleans, why would you need a TV? Other reviews have stated that the wristbands and security were problematic, but we never experienced an issue with this. Guest wristbands which we acquired frequently for our friends visiting us that were staying at nearby places were $20.00 and easy to purchase. The wristbands even come in handy in instances where a cop needs to walk you back to your hotel and you can't remember what it's called (the wristband has the hotel's name on it)! The staff at the Astor is the best, I pretty much got to know all of them while I was there: Shout out to Bull, Duana, Aria, Andrea, Shandreka, Vic! Bull was pretty much the shiz!

Some of our number prefer to socialize in the Quarter, while others of us (myself included) love the parades. The location on Canal & Bourbon makes that easy for everyone.

I commend him (or you, Don, if you read this) for the attention to detail in capturing the post-stay commentary and review as a source for information gathering and a way to identify improvements... from the quick and easy, to perhaps the tougher topics. All are addressed head on. Don, on a side note, you might want to start addressing in Yelp as well, maybe claim the property which will allow you to respond to guests. It is the up-and-coming viral 'marketing' word-of-mouth site. There's a couple doozy reviews there. I also had an EXCELLENT experience with Nancy in reservations and hope to meet her in person. She spent significant time answering questions, helping to wrap my head around proximity and travel needs, the best way to get a 1 day rental car, saving some money here and there and advising on how to address my asthma. She herself walks to work everyday and was able to just kind of give a lay of the land.

This is the first one I said I will NEVER visit again! From what I was told a woman broke her ankle while trying to take her luggage to her room, sued the hotel, so now the policy is no visitors can carry their own luggage using the cart. We were informed we couldn't, then we had to wait around 20 minutes just to get someone to take our luggage to our room, and that was after two complaints. Then once we got to the room, there was a footprint on one of the headboards. Other than that, the room was pretty clean. We called the help desk twice to requests items, was told we would receive them, after an hr, we called back, and then they informed us, they were out or they had no clean washcloths at that time. They didn't even call to let us know, but what hotel would be out of washcloths??? Also, the valey parking was horrendous! Since the hotel is on the corner of Canal and Bourbon, there's really no room to pull over to wait for the valet to move your vehicle. Saturday night, we returned to the hotel after a concert, and there was no one around to valet our car. We waited 15-20 in the car, after I located the manager, to get our car parked. On top of all of that, and paying $30/day to park, we realized they were parking the car in an uncovered parking area. someone put a flyer on our car, and after the on and off rain and sun, the paper was stuck to the windshield of our Infiniti!! Also when we first arrived and handed our car over, we were informed to call the extension when we needed the car, so the car would be available, since it would take about 15 minutes, due to the cars being parked a few blocks away. When we called to advise them to get the car, no one answered the valet line. I then called the front desk, who asked for our ticket number and said they would call the valet to have our car sent. Well I figured that wouldn't happen, so I waited ten minutes to call the front desk back, I was then told I could not call ahead I had to be down stairs before someone would go get the car! We were late to the concert!!!! I am sure there are some things I forgot to mention, anyhoo, my favorite hotel in Downtown New Orleans is Loews on Poydras, across from the W Hotel on Poydras; another favorite. Another good hotel is the Marriot Convention Center. It's newer, a little further from Canal and bourbon, but worth the walk. oh yes, also there were a lot of kids(teens) out at night right in front of the hotel. That was a bit of a mess as well! Staying off the strip, like at the W or Loews will help with transportation if you're there for a large event. Canal is usually blocked off at night. You will have to show your room key to the police to get back to your hotel, without having to go around downtown and the risk of getting lost.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cAlright hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "shabaBelfast", "ReviewID": "UR71335847", "Content": "Great location, Awful breakfast., felt it was a free for all but with little reward in the end.

On the bed was also a little gift bag that included linen water spray and foam ear plugs. When I saw the ear plugs I cringed but I never had to use them. There was a band every night that played on the corner of Bourbon and Canal directly below the room but it never seemed to interfere with anything. The sounds of the city were not that bad either. I was on the 9th floor so it was not too bad. The room was very spacious and comfortable. The AC would run only when there was a body in the room. I stayed in a place in Ft. Lauderdale FL that did the same thing so you got used to it. The room cooled down really fast so it was not an issue. No shortage of pillows or towels. The iron and ironing board worked fine. Some things I did find odd were that I could not get cold water from the tap. The first water in the morning was cold so I captured that in the glasses and for my water jug. Otherwise there was either the ice machine or the water cooler in the fitness center. They did provide coffee for the morning but not decaf, so I had to request it. My experience with the south is they don't really do decaf! No big deal really. The internet was $10 a day from the room but free in the lobby! What a pain. Since I really did not spend huge amounts of time in the room I only purchased one day out of the 6 I was there. The connection in the hotel was rather slow. The fitness center was one of the best ones I've seen. It was spacious and the equipment actually worked! Not like some where you feel like you are taking your life in your hands using it. The location was great! Right on the edge of The French Quarter. Easy access to the Quarter and easy access to trollies and shopping.

The bathtub in the room above us was leaking, so we could hear the \"drip, drip, drip\" when they decided to use the shower and the ceiling above our tub was moldy and appeared wet. The pool and deck area was way too small for a hotel this size and was not available to us for the majority of our stay due to a \"social networking\" conference that had reserved the entire tower where the pool was located. With regards to the \"social networking\"....one of the couples was given a room in the tower (Canal Tower) when they checked in and were then told 3 days later they would be moved. They needed to have all their belongings packed before we set out for the morning and had to re-check in with the front desk when we returned to get keys to their new room - so much for an advanced warning.... Actually, the hotel did not tell any of us (4 couples) about this conference, and some of the things we saw were most definately for adult eyes only - thank goodness none of us had kids there! The hotel did make arrangements with another property for pool access, but the pool was indoors and heated-not exactly what you're looking for in June in New Orleans.

Neither time did I see engineering appear and nothing was ever fixed. After waiting at the pool for three hours on 5/29 and seeing nothing was done, I asked for a compensation since I was unable to use the pool due to its unhealthy conditions. I was told the pool is a \"free amenity\" and no compensation would be offered. The person I spoke with said they sent engineering and security up to the pool. Engineering never went up to the pool and security was sent up to the pool area to ensure no one was using glass cups and said nothing about the condition of the pool, nor did they go near the pool itself to examine it. Not only is this pool a health hazard, the poor customer service I encountered was unacceptable. I have never been treated so poorly and been blatantly lied to at any hotel. I also have never seen such a disgusting pool. These are not conditions I would expect from a \"four star\" hotel. Not only will I never stay in this location again, but I will never stay in a Crowne Plaza or any of its affiliates and will discourage everyone I know from doing so.

Unluckily for us, the last 4 days of our stay coinsided with the start of the Jazz Festival, which made it impossible to find a reasonably prized hotel. We stayed 3 days at the Monteleone which is excellent in every way, but then we had to move to the Astor Crowne Plaza 2 blocks away. As the Astor was $100 more than Monteleone (which I later discovered was because of the festival), we thought it would be at least as good. It wasn\u00c2\u00b4t. The room was cold and charmless with ugly furniture. The toilet got clogged up, the hair dryer broke down and kept cutting out. The only good thing about the room was that the bed was comfortable. The swimming pool is filthy and freezing cold. No music or bar by the pool and it is too close to the street and therefore noisy. By contrast, the Monteleone has a lovely pool area on the roof with good music, a bar and nice staff, so the difference was quite stark. When we first arrived we were put in a double room with separate beds, although we had requested and paid for a queen one through Expedia. We complained and were reluctantly given another, supposedly a quiter one (which I had requested) further from the elevator and the street. When we stepped into the room there was this deafening noise! Right outside the window was an enormous cooling apparatus! I think the cooling system for the whole hotel was right outside our window. Third try, and we finally got a room on the same floor that was somewhat OK, with only a low hum from the cooling element.

We were both attending a conference being held at the nearby Hilton hotel. Almost every aspect of our stay in New Orleans was inconvenient and unpleasant, and this hotel was the biggest reason. The first day of the conference happened to be Fat Tuesday, March 16th. While we anticipated some inconveniences since it was the last day of Mardi Gras, we could not imagine the number of issues that we would ultimately have. We arrived at the hotel at 7:30 a.m. (I called ahead and asked the staff if we would have trouble driving to the hotel that morning...one staff member said we needed to arrive before 9 a.m. and another suggested arriving before 8 a.m.). When we pulled up to the hotel, there was nowhere to park and no one waiting out front. We drove a block away and asked a police officer where we were supposed to go. He told us to park in front of the hotel. We followed his advice, but still no valet came out to meet us. And no one came out with a luggage cart to assist us, even though we had a week's worth of luggage for two people. After carrying all of our luggage inside (which required two trips), I finally located an employee who promptly told me I had to move my car. When I asked if we could set our things down and check in, he told me again that the car needed to be moved. He then explained to me I had to park the car 8 blocks away in a reserved lot. I drove the car to the lot and was told that a shuttle would take me back to the hotel. After waiting 15 minutes in the parking lot (my colleague was waiting this entire time in the lobby of the hotel with our luggage since no one offered to help her), the shuttle driver drove me half a block before acting surprised that the road had been closed for a parade. I walked the 8 blocks back to the hotel. During this time, a police officer had been stationed in the lobby of the hotel, and when I entered, she aggressively demanded I show her my \"wristband\" before entering the hotel. I had no idea what she was talking about, so she told me to get out of the hotel. Luckily, someone else overheard the conversation and asked if I was checking in. When I said I was, I was finally allowed to pass. We were checking in early, so the woman at the desk said our rooms weren't ready. We decided to store our luggage while we waited. Then, I realized that she hadn't even mentioned the wristband that the police officer had demanded I show to enter the hotel. I went back to the desk and asked about the wristbands and she said \"Oh, yeah. You'll need those.\" Isn't this information she should have offered without me having to ask? She went on to aggressively warn us that if we lost the wristband, it would be a $25 charge. So, if we lost our wristbands, we would have to pay $50 to get back into the hotel which we were paying over $200 per night to stay at? Needless to say, we immediately felt very welcome at the hotel. That entire day, everyone at the hotel seemed to have an attitude of \"It's Mardi Gras, you have to fend for yourselves.\" First of all, I don't think that attitude is appropriate at all when people are paying a lot of money to stay at a nice hotel and expect convenience and a basic level of service. We were still guests of the hotel, and we shouldn't have been treated like random people walking in off the street. Furthermore, we weren't even there for Mardi Gras! No one bothered to ask if we were in town on business or for another purpose - it was just assumed that we were there to party and have a good time (and therefore shouldn't care about service). I wouldn't be concerned about the attitude of the hotel staff that day if it weren't for the fact that our problems continued throughout the rest of our stay. One day we had to call and request housekeeping clean our room (at 6 p.m.) because they never showed up. The shower head in our shower did not function properly and would shut off in the middle of taking a shower. And nearly every interaction with hotel staff felt like we were inconveniencing them. The \"customer feedback\" survey delivered to our room on the final day was the last straw. It threatened a charge of $200 if you smoked in a non-smoking room (I take it the hotel's business model is based on threatening people with fines) and then it asked us not to give a negative review based on a single interaction with hotel staff. In my opinion, had only one of these episodes happened, we would have a right to be dissatisfied (despite what the customer survey suggests). Lucky for us, we had MULTIPLE interactions and inconveniences which made the trip one of the worst we have ever taken, and this hotel one of the worst we have ever stayed in. To top it all off, I sent our concerns to the corporate headquarters after our stay. They sent us a form letter email and forwarded our feedback to the hotel management. And as a gesture of a goodwill, enrolled us in their frequent visitor program and gave us some points (not even enough for a one night stay in their cheapest properties). And we never heard from the hotel management.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cGood location, positive experience\u201d", "Author": "Reet", "ReviewID": "UR61707737", "Content": "It's all about the location!

When I called the front desk to inquire about the mix up, she informed me that \"No sir, I said one bed or two, there are no more Kings\". Then she said \"we have no rooms with views\". I said that I booked this room in JANUARY! \"Sorry sir\" was the response.

The very gracious staff gave us another double queen room on the 11th floor on the backside of the hotel overlooking the French Quarter. Perfect. Really perfect. Yes, you could hear the sounds of the 4 am party below, but for me I never had to use the supplied earplugs or eyemask, as the sound insulation from the windows was excellent and the thick curtains drowned out the ambient festive light of the street below, obviously part of the recent hotel renovation improvements. The hotel is elegant yet the lobby was small in scale compared to bigger city haunts like NY and Chicago, but it more than makes up for this in the unique ambience and unbelievably easy access to a world of sensations literally at your doorstep. Dickie Brennans is right there, as is Acme Oyster House (right under our window), Arneuds is just up the street, and all the others are within easy walking distance. I read a lot before I went to New Orleans, but I have to say that despite all I read I was really taken aback by the ease of use here (think Big Easy?, maybe I did not get this connection), but it seems French Quarter location is key. Location is everything, and this hotel has it plus all the amenities of a big city hotel. The concierge was excellent and found me a personal and private trip with \"Big E\" who showed me the Katrina devastation from many perspectives, personal, engineering, economic and social. The workout facilities were very good, offering a good combination of cardio equipment and weights.

The service at the restaurant was spectacular! A few minor flaws: TV reception was fairly lame -- I wasn't so concerned with the non-flat screen as some people have noted, but several channels were fuzzy, and the selection of channels was limited (no Comedy Channel or HGTV). But we didn't come to New Orleans to watch cable TV, so this was minor. The bathroom had one issue -- the tub wouldn't hold water for a bath, so if baths are important to you -- check this when you check in. The biggest room flaw was no min-fridge.

First, there was an issue with the food. The next morning, the blowdryer was broken. The following is an excerpt from a letter that I have written (during my stay) to the CEO and Board of Directors for this hotel: \"At this point, everything concerning the food issues, the additional night, and other prior issues had already been addressed and rectified. However, another manager, Pamela Green, subsequently called the room three times asking for information that was given the night before. Further, she began to ask us about the situation that had previously been rectified about 30 minutes earlier. Her call and reaction appeared to be entirely in response to our complaining about the food. She then stated that we seemed to be having issues and wanted to know if we had any additional complaints. We told her that the issues had been rectified, but the most recent concern stemmed from the hotel not having the required bread to fill the room service orders. Again, this fact was disclosed to us after my friend had placed the order and returned to the room. Ms. Green stated that she was not aware of the issue, which would lead a reasonable mind to believe that she had neglected to collect all of the facts prior to the first call. My friend proceeded to re-explain everything that had been previously resolved to Ms. Green. Ms. Green proceeded to call back two more times (three times total) in what amounted to what we felt was blatant harassment asking for information concerning the room that had already been verified. After the third call, during our dinner, I went down to speak with Ms. Green. Her demeanor and tone were both condescending and rude. She continued to press that she was missing information and needed it immediately. Again, this information had been provided previously, and it was about 7 p.m. at this point. If this had been any sort of issue, then I am more than confident that the hotel would have asked for it earlier in the day. I asked her why she kept calling the room (3 times), and she continued to deny that she was doing so. She further stated that she contacted an employee at home to verify information, and it was inaccurate. I asked her for the employee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name to include in this letter, and she refused. Ms. Green stated that no one deals with anyone but her. She told me that they had looked at security cameras, which was completely odd given the fact that we were complaining about food. Ms. Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements on the security camera implied that we were now being accused of criminal activity. I told her that I would be writing to the CEO and Board of Directors for this hotel. She then proceeded to tell me that she was changing the rate on the room, and that was the end of the discussion. I told her that she must follow hotel protocol and not her own. I further proceeded to tell her that she was not authorized to charge my card for any additional charges on the card used for the deposit at check-in that were not part of the agreed rate and service charges (see attachment). When checking into a hotel, one is agreeing a specified rate upon check-in, not what a manager feels they may charge to make a point. I asked for Ms. Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business card, and she stated that she did not have any.

When we arrived, the bellhop was extremely helpfull with our bags. He made a friendly joke asking if we were moving in. After reserving the room I called the hotel to request a king bed. At the Check In Desk, I specified again that I wanted a kind bed. When we got to our room, there were 2 queen beds. The bellhop immediatly called the front desk and advised of the problem. He let them know that he had another room with a king available and could fix the problem. He took us to the room and assisted us with our luggage and even went down to get new key cards and brought them back up to us. Very impressive that a bellhop could rectify the issue. The new room was on a higher floor and even had a better view straight down Bourbon St. and of the city. I have read other reviews that complained of noise from Bourbon St. From our room on the 10th floor, if I put my ear up to the window I could hear the music. But who in their right mind sleeps with their head to the window. From my bed, I heard nothing of the outside noise but it was the 10th floor. If this is an issue for you, I suggest you get a room as high as you can or get another hotel that IS NOT on Bourbon St. They do supply you with earplugs though and not as an insult. This is a commonly known fact, BOURBON ST = PARTY. USE YOUR COMMOM SENSE. The bed and bedding was extremely comfortable, especially the pillows. There was plenty of space with a cozy chair and ottoman. The room was cleaned completely and quickly everyday. The bathroom was not too spacious but still nice and the shower had a curved shower rod. Even though we brought our on soap and shampoo they supplied upscale soap, shampoo and lotion. We like it to be COLD in our house and the A/C performed waaaay better than we ever expected. It actually got too cold on the setting we put it on and had to adjust it. There was a safe in the room. Plenty of room in the closet. There was a full length mirror. The room attendant, bellhop, front desk attendants and the valets(with the exception of one valet) was very nice and helpful. They had a very nice looking bar/restaraunt, although we didn't use it. This hotel had a great location. The streetcars/trollies stop right in front on Canal St. There are several restaraunts of many types that are within walking distance. Now for the small issues. They offered free high speed internet but only in their business center. Access was available in the room for a $9.95 charge. The water pressure in the shower was good but somtimes fluctuated. On the first night, the fire alarm went off for 3 seconds MAX at 3am. Luckily, we just got in from a night of partying. The pool was a little small and was outside but was not heated. The water was a little cold and we did not get in. It also closed at 9pm and was locked. There was no spa tub. Our key card stopped working once but we went to the front desk and it was quickly reprogramed. There was no fridge or microwave in the room. The tube tv was ok but not flat screen or HDTV. One morning, the room attendant woke us up early when we placed the do not disturb sign on the door. However in her defence, the sign did fall off the door handle and was lying on the floor and she did not see it. The parking can get a little packed when you pull up to drop of you car for valet. There was one valet that was a little rude. We pulled up in the car and he said that he couldn't get the seat to pull up before. When I told him the seat motor had broken, he said that he might get us to park it. I thought this was extremely rude and unprofessional when we were paying for that service. I also thought the cost of the valet service was a little costly at $31.60/day. They also took a little longer than usual to get the car. I would suggest that you call the valet ahead of time so your wait won't be as long. However, on the last day of our stay I called ahead so that we could have the car waiting, load it up and leave quickly. I was told that they were busy and I would have to come down to request my car. I didnt see the sense in this since they would still have to go get the car anyways. However, these were small issues and overall our stay was very pleasant. I would stay again and recommend this place to anyone.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "DanielDP", "ReviewID": "UR40247291", "Content": "I enjoyed my stay at this hotel: fine customer service, good complimentary breakfast for priority club members, reasonable rates, decent rooms.

I saw a sign in the elevator advertising a breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant but when we went to the restaurant one morning, we saw that it was closed.

She told me that the concierge confirmed that the restaurant was in fact *not* opened for breakfast, albeit in a dismissive way as if we didn't know what we were talking about. When she insisted that we had indeed read some information, the concierge directed us to the third floor which turned out to be the \"Executive Club\"., for which we fortunately eligible to visit as we were Priority Club members.

We booked the hotel room through a price-bidding travel site and ended up being very pleased with the results. The hotel is located at the corner of Bourbon and Canal Streets and is right in the middle of all of the action. We had a room overlooking Bourbon Street and we didn't notice any of the noise the first night we were there, but on the second night it was quite a bit louder from approximately 11 pm until 5 am or so. Even so, the noise was not so loud that it was bothersome as we are not light sleepers, but if you are a light sleeper I would recommend asking for a room on the other side of the hotel. It also helps that Crowne Plaza hotels offer free sleep aid kits in their rooms and earplugs are included in the kit. We'd heard horror stories about the valet parking at the hotels in the area and instead parked in a nearby parking garage, which was less expensive and we had no trouble or wait in getting the car when we were departing. The hotel is newly renovated and was very nice - plenty of marble and crystal in the lobby, and new carpeting on the floor we were staying on. All of the staff we came in contact with were very pleasant and willing to do whatever they could to improve our stay. The rooms are fairly standard, but nicely decorated and with very comfortable beds. It was within walking distance of anything you might want to see in the French Quarter, the Mississippi River, and the Central Business District. Guided tours for anything you might want (cemeteries, swamps, haunted tours) are all offered in the lobby. We spent the majority of our time simply walking around the French Quarter and exploring the historical streets and staying in a hotel that with such a great location made that much easier. I don't recommend the room service unless you are desperate. Like room service in most places, it is over-priced and there are many much better options only steps away on Bourbon Street.

I am pleased that I have visited New Orleans but I felt there was very little there to do/ visit and wouldn't return the in future.\" Make sure you go on the Hurricane Katrina tour, this tour takes you out of the centre of New Orleans to where most of the devastion took place- really worth the money. Take a river cruise on the Steamboat NATCHEZ along the Mississippi river\" Make sure you check your bill on check out, as when we checked out they tried to bill us over $150 for 5 nights parking- which was pretty amazing really since we flew from the UK. Also when retruned back to UK we found out we had been charged $24 for 2 movies watched from the room which was not the case, we rang the hotel and the money was refunded and the hotel apologised for the error- Just make sure you check your check out bill and your credit card statement when home.", "Date": "February 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baton Rouge", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "blankstarlight", "ReviewID": "UR24051556", "Content": "CLEAN, great staff, great location.

Hotel is a great location at the corner of Bourbon and Canal and is close to Harrah's, the Superdome and the nightlife on Bourbon. However, that was about the only positive thing about our stay. First off we had to wait forever to check in because there werent enough front lobby people behind the counters. Secondly, you need to know that they will take your car and park it like 5 blocks from the hotel so make sure you get everything you need when they take it to park it. If you don't they will go back and get it for you, but then you have to tip everytime they do it. We got to our room and the A/C didnt work properly. We turned the A/C all the way down to 65 (as low as it would go) and it would hardly ever come on and when it did, it was warm and humid with no air circulation. We had requested an interior room in the renovated section not facing Bourbon or Canal so at least our room was very quiet. However, with it being an interior room (there was a small window) we think that it contributed to the room being humid and warm. Three of us stayed in the room and we all left with a sore throat because of the room temp/air circulation. Next thing we wanted to do when we got there was take showers, and there were NO wash cloths! The entire time we had to ask the housekeeping staff to bring us washcloths. I called the front desk to complain and they said we should have them, but EVERY time they cleaned out room they only left us hand towels and regular towels. Oh and the bathroom is TINY, so is the shower--barely enough room to move around. The restaurant in the lobby was so-so and WAY overpriced. You can head down one of the side streets off Bourbon and get the same food for much less, guess they can charge that because of the location. Also, dont even think about ordering room service. We tried on 3 different occasions to order it and they would always say they would bring us a menu but never did. My recommendation would be to pay the extra $50 a nite and stay at the Ritz. All of our friends were at the Ritz and had a fabulous stay-and the Ritz is one block over in the same location. Their rooms were larger, more airy and the service there is impeccable. And watch coming in late. There is a really rude security guard that makes you show your room key to get in the building. This is totally understandable being that Canal at late hours is pretty dangerous, but he didnt have to be so rude about letting us in. Total jerk. And when I checked out, I found the hotel had booked two reservations under my name, including one with a no-show charge on my credit card. The manager said he would credit it back, and after making me wait 30 minutes he said he credited it back. Well I checked my card today and it was NOT credited back yet so I had to call and deal with the people there again. We had friends stay at other hotels like Hotel Monteleone and Bienville House and they all had great stays...check some of those out, plus they are closer to the French Market and Jackson Square.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, CA", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Location/Super Hotel\u201d", "Author": "lgoodwood", "ReviewID": "UR23265775", "Content": "We booked our room at the Astor in New Orleans for 12/25/08-1/01/09 and were a little concerned after reading some of the reviews here. However, we had a fabulous time! The hotel is at the corner of Bourbon and Canal and directly adjacent to the streetcar line. This was our second time to New Orleans and this time we took less cabs because so much was accessible by streetcar. (12$ for 3 days unlimited on/off and transfers). We went to the French Market, Cafe du Monde, the Insectarium, Harrah's, Camellia Grill, Angelo Brocato's, toured the city, etc., all by streetcar. (Thus avoiding the valet issues which some have noted. However, we did use the valets to hail cabs and I can say they hustled their tails, sometimes even going down 2 blocks to get cabs for us.) Our room was very pretty and included all the usual Crowne Plaza amenities. We were on the top floor, so we only heard the sirens from Canal Street. However, the desk clerk had asked if we wanted quiet, so I would suggest if quiet is your goal that you ask for a high floor or a room not overlooking Bourbon. We did not hear any noise from the other rooms other than the doors slamming sometimes. They also gave us a late checkout since our flight wasn't leaving until almost 5pm, and then held our luggage at the valet after that. Our air conditioning worked great. There is a slight mustiness in the hallways, but I noticed it in several other places on our trip including a couple of very nice restaurants. There is a lot of moisture here, and after Katrina, I'm sure some mildew issues. However, it was not present in our rooms/beds/bathrooms/bar etc., and was clearly not caused by neglect. The only issue we had was the first night by husband tried to move the bed to plug in the lamps and knocked it off the casters they use to raise the bed. We were immediately assisted by the bell desk and then the engineering department who were both very nice and helpful. I will say the engineering guy was very happy that our air conditioning was working good, so that may be an issue as others have noted, but we did not experience it. We also had no problems with our keycards. If you are looking for a highly sterile/cookie-cutter stay in New Orleans, it is possible this isn't for you.

I was pleasantly surprised to find bathrobes in the closet and a refrigerator. Compared to the rooms my friends had, it seemed like I had a junior suite. (it could have been because it was on a corner) The restaraunt downstairs has wonderful food. Infact a lot of people seem to think so too because there were more than just hotel guest dining there. I have stayed in several hotels in and around the French Quarter area, and I have to say this one is becoming my favorite. When you walk in you feel like you are walking into a much classier hotel than one owned by Holiday Inn. The only complaint I had was the parking situation. You pretty much have to use the valet service and you have to make the block a couple of times before you can slide into the unloading zone. Once you get unloaded they inform you of the $31.00 a day fee for parking. I guess you have to expect that in a large city.

Parking is problematic. There are about 5 spaces that you can pull into in front of the hotel on Canal Street. We had to circle around Canal once to get one of these coveted spots. (Not that we did, but don't even think about about double-parking on Canal.) I think we were lucky to circle around once because we were checking in at 10pm. The Valets hoarded the luggage carts in a luggage room in front of the hotel by the Canal St. entrance. I only saw one for the five cars parked in front of the hotel. We were not able to use one because our Valet mentioned that the room was locked. Checking in at 10pm there was no wait at the the Front Desk, but I think we caught the Front Desk Staff at the end of a very long day (no excuses for a 4 star hotel.) She was very harried and not particularly nice. AT FIRST, we we're staying in the Alexa tower? room #5501. Terrible. Only one of the key cards worked. The room overlooked one of the sidestreets and every possible noise on that sidestreet came right into the room, Where were the ear plugs and CD that everyone spoke of? I don't think they routinely let this room, because the A/C would not even turn on, but they did have an unsightly dehumidifier in the room. The room smelled intoxicatingly of paint fumes. You would think that if the room was let out often, the A/C would be working. We called the Front Desk who said that Engineering would be by to fix the A/C. We waited 30 minutes before calling again. This time, new Front Desk staff came on and said that it be another 30-40 minutes \"because of the time change.\" My husband asked for a new room and this was honored. Maybe, because this time he dropped the, \"Hi, this is DR. XYZ from...\" We were put into the Canal Tower room #740. Much better. A/C was already running and we had the ear plugs/eye mask/CD awaiting on one of the beds...not that they were needed. This room was so quiet compared to the first. No intoxicating paint fumes! The rest of our 3-night stay, we didn't really encounter rude Staff. As small as this issue is, it was an annoyance. The key cards seemed to work half of the time. We had those replaced on a daily basis. We did not keep them near a cell phone or a credit card. After we had them replaced the 3rd time, Front Staff sent Engineering to our room who checked out the door. They said that the door was working properly. I know that it was not us with the problem because a couple down our hallway asked us to help them get into their room with their key card and there was at least one other couple in line with us, each of our three times, who also had their key cards replaced. The fitness/pool areas (can't recall the floors) were closed for renovation, but this did not affect us and may have for other patrons. Would we stay here again? No. I'll stay at the Sheraton across the street. At least, there, you can pull into a covered passenger loading/unloading area with luggage carts that abound. The Sheraton was what we expected from a 4-star hotel and did not encounter problems worth mentioning on a review. We thought we'd give the Astor a try as it was also listed as 4 stars and had a convenient location on Bourbon/Canal. One more thing. Checking out was fast at 10am on Columbus Day morning. No wait.

Also, if you go out the back of the restaurant or the front of the hotel and turn the corner, you are on Bourbon St, which, as we are both in our early 20's was very appealing to us. However, there was no noise at all during the night. All the staff was great, very friendly and helpful. During the night/early morning shift there is a doorsman outside who is quite a kick.

The booking was made with the expectations of staying in an upscale 4-star hotel. This was to be a memorable occassion for the basketball team that I coach. Unfortunately, that dream turned out to be a nightmare. First of all things, the staff at the front desk were not customer focused during our check-in process. We were standing in line and a disgruntled guest cut the line and walked straight up to the clerk, as though we were not even standing there. The staff on hand proceeded to assist the guest and completely disregarded our presences. I checked into four rooms. Two of the four rooms were not up to par. One room had a problem with the door opening and closing. The other room had a clogged up sink, with a broken faucet and a leaking air conditioning unit. A complaint was filed at the front desk and the attendant stated that she would change our room if the problem could not be corrected. It took two engineers to come up before our issue was properly addressed. However, the situation wasn't rectified. The sink was temporarily unclogged, as this solution lasted for about two usages. The door was not fixed. The engineer said that there was nothing that he could do about it. The pan to the air conditioning unit was emptied, only to refill and cause the carpet inside the room and immediately outside the door to be drenched. It was too late to move the kids to another room, so I waited until the next morning and contacted the front desk. I was told that the manager was in a meeting. I attempted to contact the manager again and was blindly transferred to an answering service. I did leave a message for the manager, but he never returned my call. On top of the room problems, the valet attendants could not locate the keys to my vehicle. I had to wait for 50 minutes to receive my vehicle, after calling in advance to ensure that vehicle would be available. This was a major issues, because we were participating in a basketball tournament and that didn't allow the kids to have ample time to warm-up. The valet manager was supposed to contact me and never did hear from him/her. The next day, we called in advance to have the vehicle ready for early departure, only to again wait for over 45 minutes. This time, the vehicle was received with damages to the mirror. The attendants promised to get this taken care of before we checked out. Well, of course that didn't happen. On top of all of this, there were dead roaches in the corridor. This was definitely far from a 4-star experience. I left New Orleans and stayed in a 3-star hotel in Duluth, Georgia, which was hand-down, far more superior to this hotel.

The worst part of the trip was the Sunday \"valet\" parking. Don't get suckered!!! They state on the vallet parking instructions that on Sunday you may have to wait 1-2 hours to get your car. My guess is it is longer than that so they offer you this shuttle to get your car. You pick up your keys from the valet service. They then pick you and others up in a small bus, ours did not have air conditioning-in July it was a sauna, and take you a few blocks to the parking garage. You have guys rushing around like mad to get you your car, and then you wait to leave the parking garage. The shuttle is acceptable, if it would have had AC and if they would have informed us previously. Basically you pay for valet parking and you use a shuttle-just be aware and plan ahead.

The room consists of a comfortable, firm matress, roughly a dozen pillows, a television set, safe and desk. My room was reasonably kept throughout my stay. All of the action from Bourbon street can certainly be audible on the weekend but the hotel provides you with a sleep-pack of ear plugs, mask, scented mist, and relaxation music. One frustration was the lack of free internet access in the hotel rooms. There was an ethernet connection in the rooms, which costed - I believe - $10 for the week if not more. There was no wireless connection provided by the hotel, forcing me to scan the area for weak signals that I could sporadically leech. There was a decent signal on the ground floor from a nearby restaurant. I don't believe it's unreasonable to expect free wireless to hotel guests of a 3/4 star hotel. I give kudos to the hotel staff who are quite friendly if you approach them. If you are sociable, they can provide you with a lot of assistance during your stay.

Aside from all that we made the best of it until at 3:30am people started arguing outside our door and we had to call security because it was getting out of hand, well after 30min security finally came and settled the matter.

However, this year I had a big problem with a security issue. During Mardi Gras the hotel places a table at the entrance of the hotel & checks guest's arm-bands (which are issued at check-in to prevent non-guests from entering). On Saturday night I let my 19 year old son go meet his girl friend at a restaurant & told him to be home early. When he returned to the hotel he had his girlfriend with him & was told she could not enter the hotel unless she had an arm band & that he could purchase one for her at the front desk. My son told the big burly security guard \"OK\" , grabbed his girlfriend's hand and proceded to the front desk to buy her am arm band--- This is when the terror hit for my son! He was thrown up against the wall by two security guards (my son is 139 punds!). He told them that he was going to the desk to get his girlfriend a band- because the front desk workers have to apply it- He was physically thrown out of the hotel. The manager told him to come back later- SO, he sent my son out into the dangerous night of new orleans. They went to eat french donuts and came back. He was then told by the gaurds that he would not be allowed back in the hotel that night & sent my son to sleep on the street. My son was scared & he was scared to call me because he didn't want to bother me. When it started to get late, I called his cell phone. He told me the story & this little woman went down stairs to give those guys a peice of my mind. There were hundreds of drunk people coming in & out of that hotel; there was vomit in front of my door, people passed out in the lobby & they thought it was neccesary to use such force with my 139 lb child. They owe us an appology. There were 4 shootings the street over the night this happened. Thank God my son wasn't one of them. These people should have called me if there was a problem.

The room I stayed in was clean, comfortable and very generic. However, the hotel seems to be having some real difficulties. The restaurant was poorly staffed and no one seemed to know what they were doing. The hotel air conditioning system was totally messed up. Most of the meetings rooms were absolutely freezing, yet the humidity was incredibly high. That said, I would whole heartedly recommend a stay at the Astor Crowne Plaza.

There were revelers and multi piece bands playing right outside the hotel until 4 am. This is of course what's fun about New Orleans for many.

The lady who answered the phone had no idea where the hotel was located. She kept saying \"Find the business district\". We have no idea where that is. We went to a gas station and asked and they got us there. It's now 10pm and we try to valet park. We sat in front of the hotel for 20 minutes while the valet guys chatted and talked on their phones, again we don't know where to park. They finally graced us with the privilege of paying about $30 a day for the valet. We go inside to check in and stood in line for another 45 minutes because there was only one person behind the counter but there are 20 people checking in. We get to our room which was okay, but the AC was off. We turn it down to about 70 to get it nice and cool by the time we get back from the bars. We return to the room about 4 am to find that the ac not on. It was sooooo hot and stuffy, but i will admit we were too messed up to call the front desk to stay up even later to wait for them. In the morning, housekeeping woke us up at 8am. Since we got to the room at 4am, i was not happy to be woken up. They walked in the room! Never a knock, nothing. I yelled \"get out\" and the lady yells \"well next time put the do not disturb sign out\" i yell \"next time knock\". There was never an \"oh I'm sorry\" or anything, just yelling. The lady returned at 10:30, this time with a knock and said, \"you only have 30 minutes until check out\" What is she my mother. I'll pay the extra fee if i have to for checking out late. I have never had someone tell me when to leave a room. I'm a paying guest, don't talk to me like that. We told the lady at the desk about the AC and she said \"oh you should have called when you first got to the room and we could have moved you\".

Our last stay was in the summer of 2005 pre-Katrina. It has always been an excellent top-notch experience. 4-stars all the way. Unfortunately... it has not recovered from Katrina. We took a cruise out of New Orleans for Spring Break last week. The couple who were traveling with us wanted us all to stay over an additional night and got on Priceline to book a one-night stay. We were thrilled when they told us they got the Astor for $85.00. Our previous stays had been at least $135.00 a night and up. Now we see why they price is so cheap. Getting to the hotel after dis-embarking the ship just before noon, the Valet was helpful in getting us parked. Valet parking at the Astor has always been a nightmare so it was a pleasant surprise to get parked quickly and efficiently. That was the end of the improvements at the Astor. Our rooms were ready even though it was before Noon. We soon learned that the reason was that most of the hotel was almost vacant. They were apparently only using a few floors of the building. They had no bellmen on duty apparently and after waiting 20 minutes to get our luggage brought up, one of the management was kind enough to bring it up himself. Otherwise our luggage would have sat unattended indefinitely in the entrance to the hotel on Canal. Our room was clean enough but the wear and tear was evident. Very much changed from our last visit in '05. Stains on the carpet and bed covers. Generally dusty not quite \"right\". Yes, we found mouse trap strips under the beds but no mice thankfully. The room was hot and the air worked minimally eventually cooling down during the night. The hallway was full of room service trays... some from breakfast, and then later on lunch and dinner. When we went to bed around 10pm, they still hadn't been picked up (including the breakfast trays). As someone else pointed out, no wonder they have a rodent problem! The kids wanted to swim so we headed to the pool. The pool and workout area seemed unchanged. I went to grab a soda out of the machine there on the third floor which read sold out. I went to another machine on another floor... also \"sold out\". Another floor- same thing. And another. I saw a woman who appeared to be with housekeeping and asked about the coke machines all being empty. She mumbled something about them \"going fast\" and said I should try on the upper floors. I went up to the 14th floor where the machine said it had drinks but wouldn't take a $1 bill. Back down to the 13th floor and BINGO! A machine that had drinks and took my money. It even spit out two cokes! BONUS--- after only half an hour of trying to buy a Coke!!! If you want to be creeped out, go to the upper floors of the Astor. They are apparently unused any more. It was like being in the Shining. We got up and left the next morning so I can't comment on how housekeeping performs but I expect it was on par with the dirty trays in the hall and the empty Coke machines. I tried to guess occupancy based on the number of USATodays laying in front of doors. We were on the 5th floor and maybe a third of the rooms had papers laying out. It's clear that the hotel is being run on a skeleton staff. What a shame. Crowne Plaza should be so much better than this!!! This used to be our favorite hotel in the Quarter.

The room had two queen beds and were quite comfortable. Though a non-smoking room, it a had a lingering odor of smoke. The closet space was adequate for a three night stay. The bathroom was definitely more upscale: ceramic tile floors, granite-top sink; and upscale water fixtures. Towels and complimentary toiletries were restocked daily. The room temperature was a bit cool even though the \"stat\" was set at 71 degrees. We didn't eat at the on-site restaurant preferring to take in the local eateries.

My 3rd day, it took over 45mins to get my car. Every time I asked about my car, the valet person told me it was coming. I told them that I could have walked to my workplace in 20mins instead of waiting for my car. They told me that they will not charge me for that day. I decided that I won't be using their valet service again. I ended up using another parking place; this was right behind the hotel ($20/night) and it took them 5 mins to get my car. When I returned to the hotel that night, again, I could not open my door. I went to the registration counter & was told that they checked me out already (Thurs.); I had a reservation til Friday. While waiting for the hotel staffs to sort out the issue, I spoke to other hotel guests nearby. Apparently these guests were having problems with their reservation; the hotel did not have rooms for them. At checkout on Fri, they charged me an extra day of parking.

Can you provide working ice machines on any other than the 4th floor? 2. Can you furnish edible room service (filet/chicken entrees were totally substandard) ? 3. Can you provide fresh towels (no add'l towels after 2 requests). 4. Can you, please, please fix the dripping faucet in the bath tub? I missed NOLA last year because of Katrina.

I would have given this hotel a higher rating, had it not been for an unbelievably uncomfortable encounter with the front desk manager who was so rude and unprofessional, I sent a letter to the general manager (the first time I have ever done such a thing). Basically, there was confusion about the charge for Internet services in the hotel's business center. My classmate, without asking, got her fee waived by this manager, since she (as many of us) had to post an assignment for class. My classmate encouraged me to ask the front desk manager for the same waiver, since I also had to post an assignment. I guess I caught the manager in a bad mood, because she laid into me about expecting the same thing that another guest had (she actually said \"If you overheard me comp a room for a guest, I suppose you would expect a free room too?\"). I was shocked, and asked her to explain what the difference was, since we were doing an assignment for the same class. She said \"we are not a consistent business, and if I want to waive a fee for someone who is polite, I will do so.\" I've worked in retail for years, and I know when people are being rude or impolite, and I was certainly not. She then called the Business Center and said \"I have a guest here who wants to use the Internet for free. I WAS going to give it to her, but now she's just arguing with me.\" First of all, that was a lie--she told me flat-out that she would not waive the fee for me. And, arguing I was not doing. I don't like to draw attention to myself, nor do I complain about service. Her unprofessionalism was so egregious, however, that I felt personally insulted and wanted an answre that made sense, customer service-wise. I feel as though this front desk manager meted out such waivers as the whim struck, and grew angry when I caught her in several lies about why she waived the fee for my classmate (she said, at one point, that my classmate's laptop was broken, which would be acceptable, had my classmate owned a laptop or borrowed one, which she did not). It was one of those situations in which you cannot believe things are unfolding as they are. This woman, the front desk manager, seemed to delight in making me beg and actually smirked when I cried (she really upset me). It was disgusting, and I am sharing this experience with anyone I know who travels. Since my letter to the hotel has not been responded to, I feel this is my only recourse. As for the hotel itself, please read on: Upon arrival, our group encountered nice, but very confused front desk clerks. Our group of 12 had been reserved in 4 rooms through our professor, and the front desk clerks were unable to figure out who was assigned to which room. In fact, they couldn't retrieve my professor's reservation. They gave a room to four of my peers, who moved their luggage in and began taking turns in the shower. When my professor arrived (30 minutes later), the confusion was cleared up by the front desk manager. However, the four women who had been assigned a room and moved in had to move out and go to the correct room (since the front desk clerk did not give them the right one). The rooms themselves were ok, though the promised queen size beds were full-size. We were missing some key items in the room, including a bath mat for the shower, and we were given those very quickly. We did notice, though, that the daily room cleanup did not include any dusting, so the coffeepot, end tables, and desk had a pretty gross layer of dust the entire time we stayed there. I did not get a chance to use the concierge services, on-site restaurant, or fitness center, so I cannot comment on those.

It's sleazier than ever and is most inappropriate for impressionable youth. I can party as hearty as anyone and have liberal veiws, but Bourbon Street has virtually no limits. Wandering drunk tourists, women openly flashing their breasts for some cheap beads, t-shirts for sale with the most vulgar words possible emblazones on them, and posters of nearly nude women in suggestive poses advertising live sex shows.

There is no parking garage connected or valet service (that I could get wind of) and their garage is down the street a block from the hotel. I ended parking in a public parking garage in the back street of the hotel which was faster, easier and cheaper. The hotel is currently serving as home for displaced people, so the atmosphere was more like overworked apartment managers.

The front desk was positively overwhelmed. In fact, we ended up dragging our luggage into our room after the 20 min wait to check in (front desk was considering/resolving the problems of various displaced who were being moved to another hotel or straightening out some service). There was no room service menu in the room, we were told to go to the attached restaurant, which was not the hotels restaurant so although we asked for \"real\" (not styrafoam) plates and forks, we couldn't get them.

How and the heck can the Crown Plaza charge their guests $27 a day for this ?? I could have just parked my car in a full service garage behind the hotel and had a much more enjoyable experience.

Jeronica & Pamela at the front desk handled the couple of issues that we had with no problem, basically because we had guys that had a King Bed... and you know how upset they can be with that. Personally, Jeronica deserves a special something because she was able to handle the most difficult problems with ease and with no frustration when the other front desk personnel were easy to become frustrated with the problems that occured. She said there was not a Front Desk Manager on duty, but she was great and made some exceptions to make our guests happy. The rooms look just the way they do on the website.

This hotel has the best location if you plan to spend time on Burbon street or the French Quarter. Also, upon arrival they provide you with ear plugs :) because it does get rather loud both on Burbon (hotel is on corner of Burbon and Canal) and on Canal Street. Also, the streetcars are right there, so you will have great and easy access to the heart of New Orleans. Also, the lobby is really pretty. Now. I won't ever stay at this hotel again. First off, they charge $21.99 a night for VALET parking. Aside from checking in, we only attempted to use valet parking once... at checkout. When I called to give them my ticket number for them to pull my car up, I was greeted by a voice mail which said to for me to take my luggage out the front door and get in the shuttle where they will drive me to the parking garage and I can get out and drive my car out myself. This is UNACCEPTABLE (and I wonder if it is criminal). I'm NOT going to pay the most I have ever paid for valet parking to be shuttled to a parking garage. So I called the front desk and they told me to call valet parking (i.e. voice mail). So then I called the \"excellent service\" number, a number provided upon arrival in case you have any complaints. The woman who answered didn't want to hear anything and transferred me to the front desk (where I already had called)... then I called and asked for the manager on duty, who explained that they shuttle because the traffic on Canal Street. So I looked out the window, Suday morning at 9:30, and I counted about 5 cars on Canal Street. No traffic. The manager on duty did get my car pulled up for me and my husband. So the problem was solved-- but not before I had to wait 20 minutes for someone to take responsibility for solving this issue. The room is pure Holiday Inn. Under the sink in the bathroom, there was a HUGE hole in the wall. The toilet paper hangs on a hook under the sink where you have to lean over to get it, and then it falls off to the floor every time you try and get some. The hair dryer didn't work, and the iron was missing half of the base so that I almost burned myself when I went to put it on the ironing board. Room service was a trainwreck. They had told me the wait was 30 minutes. My breakfast didn't get there until one hour, 5 minutes later. The waffle was cold and soggy with much too much powdered sugar on it. My chocolate milk was made with white milk and syrup and was room temperature. They did comp. my breakfast, which was a good thing since I couldn't eat it. They advertised a gift shop in the lobby. When I asked for directions at the front desk to the sundry shop, the girl looked at me with a blank stare because she didn't know what sundries were. When I said I wanted a coke and a snack, she sent me to the *liquor* store next door to the hotel. I should have asked for the store by name, and I still don't know if there is a sundry store IN the hotel. The bottom line is: if this is a splurge and you normally stay at 2 star hotels, you'll probably enjoy it. If you like to stay at luxury hotels or luxury botique hotels, then the best Holiday Inn has to offer just won't measure up. Instead of this hotel, if you don't mind staying on the other side of Canal Street, I recommend the Reinassance Hotel.", "Date": "June 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indio, CA", "Title": "\u201cIgnore negative comments about staff\u201d", "Author": "glrsandldy", "ReviewID": "UR3545277", "Content": "I almost cancelled my reservation after reading many of the negative comments, especially about the front desk.

No problem with noise if you are above the 5th floor or so. Saturday night a street band played loudly until about 11PM, but that was it.

I was a little disappointed that the rooms were not as nice as the Crowne Plaza I stayed in San Francisco (which had free internet connection unlike this one) and they are smallish.

The streets reek of sour beer even though the store owners hose the sidewalks down regularly. It looks like one of the previous guests had spilled a maragarita on a corner of the room carpet because it was still a little sticky and stained red.

Here's a critique of our stay: LOCATION: If it's possible to be at the edge of the quarter and in the heart of it at the same time, then that describes the Astor. One door goes out to Bourbon and the other to Canal St. It's great if you want to experience the quarter, but want to leave it and look at other sites as well. This is the perfect hotel if you're NOT driving. We never even needed our car. The Canal St. cable car and the Garden District car both stop right across the street from the hotel. ROOMS: The rooms were exceptionally clean and very comfortable. The \"sleep amenities\" are wonderful. They include super pillows, room blackening drapes, eye masks, and some sort of sleep CD but we never saw that while we were there. We were on the 9th floor, away from Bourbon, and even on New Year's Eve it was quiet. The hotel was full during that time for the Sugar Bowl, but it was still really quiet. Loved that! Room had great lamps too, if you like to read. HOUSEKEEPING: Rooms were clean (and I'm a germ freak so that says something). I also loved that the duvet covers were pristine white, so you KNEW that they'd been freshly washed before you got there. It made the whole room feel clean. Housekeeping staff were wonderful--everyone spoke to us and made us feel welcome. Wish I could say the same for the.... FRONT DESK: Sadly, this wasn't the highest point of our stay. From check-in on, the front desk staff just wasn't very friendly or helpful. We dealt with them daily on various things and they acted like we were inconveniencing them every time. No smiles, no \"Good Morning,\" nothing. It's too bad because I've always felt like the front desk sets the tone for the whole stay. The management seemed great---maybe it's hard to find good help there. Note to the Astor: let your housekeeping department come in and train the front desk on how to make your guests feel #1. RATE: This is the best part. The value was unbelievable. We paid $119 a night for every night but the 30th and 31st (those were around $249). Even when they were full during the Sugar Bowl, our rate didn't go up. In my opinion, this is the BEST located hotel in the quarter, and the rate is better than any other hotel we checked. By the way, we stayed with our 8 and 10 year old, used room service, and found that to be a great value, too. DON'T MISS: There are so many things to see and do, but here are my favorites. THE PRALINE CONNECTION GOSPEL BRUNCH--wow is all I can say. These women can SING! My kids (who thought they were going to be bored) had a great time and got invited up on stage which was the highlight of their trip. DICKIE BRENNAN'S STEAK HOUSE: Best meal I've ever had and right around the corner from the Astor. HAUNTED HISTORY GHOST TOUR: Great way to \"sneak\" some history lessons on your kids. SWAMP TOUR: Didn't really want to do this one, but it ended up being a great day--even with no gators to be seen.

Check in was smooth and as they didn't have our requested King Room we were placed on the fourth floor where we would receive complimentary breakfast and snacks at dinner time. Breakfast was a choice of cold cereal, juice, coffee/tea, various rolls and yogurt. Evening snacks included two hot appetizer meats and you could purchase beer or wine. Our room on this floor had a view of a parking garage where honking cars lived. I say honking cars tongue in cheek because it seemed the rule there was to honk while driving up or down in the garage to alert other drivers you were coming. It wasn't a huge issue to us, but next visit we will request a view of the city. Otherwise the room was very quiet with a nice bed. We'd stay here again due to the great proximity to the French Quarter (right on the corner of Bourbon and Canal), close enough to Bourbon St. without all the noise. We did a couple things while in NOLA that I'd like to suggest you try. Chef Joe Faroldi has a cooking class called the Louisiana Heritage Cafe School of Cooking (------------------------ ) in the Beinville House Hotel. Chef Joe has lived his entire life in the French Quarter and peppers his class with stories of those days and wonderful cooking suggestions. If you go make sure you're hungry as his cooking class helpings are huge. The menu on our trip included Seafood Beignets, mixed green garden salad with creole honey mustard dressing, Cajun Jambalaya and a delicious Bread Pudding with Bananas Foster Sauce topping (his creation). Yum! We read about Chef Joe in the local advertising book in our room. Commanders Palace is not to be missed, make your reservations before you go as they fill up early. We had the lunch special-absolutely excellent. The bread pudding souffle is superb, and will ruin your taste buds for any other bread pudding. We also ate at Emeril's Delmonico resturant the last night of our stay. I wish we'd eaten there the first night as we agree we'd have enjoyed it more (too much rich food all week). The food was well prepared and the servers were knowledgable and efficient. Mr. B's Bistro is not a place we'll return to. Crowded, the drinks are so-so, and the food is the same. I had the barbequed shrimp which is a messy meal, heads on the shrimp and to me tasted like dirt. Their bread pudding was dry, not to be recommended.

We had reservations for one night (Friday), but decided to stay an extra night. As many of the reviews have said, the best thing about the Astor is the location. Located on the corner of Bourbon and Canal, the hotel is located near everything. I was pleased with the hotel. We were there about a week before Christmas and the lobby was decorated beautifully. Our room was just that, a room. Nothing really to write home about, but it was very clean and spacious. I found the bed to be very comfortable. We were on the 8th floor with a pretty decent view of Canal St. I believe the hotel is 14 stories. The Astor also has a work-out room and pool/jacuzzi on the 3rd floor. The work-out room seemed nice enough (although a bit small), and the pool/jacuzzi on the deck would be nice for warm weather. Downstairs in the lobby is a decent sized bar with a flat screen tv built into the wall. I had a beer and watched the football game for about an hour in this area. It was a nice area to relax and just chill in. The bar is a bit pricey. I believed I paid $4.25 for an Abita Beer on draft. But whatever, it's a hotel bar, so of course it's going to be a little on the expensive side. There is also a restaraunt attached to the hotel (right off the bar), that we did not at eat at. The restaraunt also serves breakfast in the morning. They had a Continental breakfast for $9.99 or you could get everything on the Continental plus eggs and a few other itmes for somewhere in the $13.00 range. For what you got, it seemed a bit pricey to me. There's a place called Mena's that serves breakfast, and is located only a few blocks (walking distance) from the hotel which I would recommend. Super cheap and the food was good. If you drive in (and valet park), make sure you get everything out of your car that you need, as the parking garage is 10 blocks away. The valet's exact words to me were \"Make sure you get everything out of your car cause your vehicle is going in a parking garage 10 blocks away.\" When we left, a shuttle bus took us and others to the parking garage. A bit of a hassle, but no to big of a deal. We paid $22 a day to park. Not cheap, but it beats driving around New Orleans looking for a place to park on the street. I didn't have much dealings with the staff, so I can't really comment on them. All-in-all this was a very nice hotel that I would stay at again without hesitation!

My Criteria: 3+ to 4 star hotel, clean and reasonably priced, close to downtown (French Quarter) After reading quite a few (hotel) reviews in Trip Advisor, I felt a little uneasy about booking anything in New Orleans (A recent jaunt to Orlando left me underwhelmed about tourist towns). My past experience with the Crowne Plaza (Windsor, Ontario and Montreal Quebec) helped in my decision. I am happy to say that the other reviews for the Crowne were accurate (except for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjust ok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they must be used to 5-star hotels) and I received exactly what I expected: a clean, quiet room, with a nice view (my particular room gave the long view of Bourbon street) and reasonably priced ($148). All of the staff was very pleasant and they always had a friendly greeting for me. (Yes, ALL) I did not drive, so I cannot comment on parking, but I think valet is 30/night or there are self-parking lots close by (10/night). I did notice that the drop-off zone is quite small due to the hotels location, but my driver had no problem picking me up. Also, I cannot comment on room service (did not order), but there were plenty of very nice restaurants close by that I was quite content with. The casino is a short walk (5-10 minutes) if you are the gambling type, but I would recommend a cab (not to put a scare into any one, I walk everywhere, but I always stay with the crowds and away from dark alleys). Bottom line: I will return to New Orleans and more than likely, unless I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m feeling a bit adventurous (Hotel Monaco was my second choice based on Trip Advisor reviews), I will stay at the Crowne.
