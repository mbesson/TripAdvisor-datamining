Good things: - Location is perfect; - The rooms are located away from the street, no noise; - Near the hotel there are really good restaurants and Ice cream :D; - Big space in the room, nice for groups; - Cheap internet; Bad things: - The cleaning was terrible in the room and in the bathroom; - If you arrive any time out of the open time of the reception, you need to pay 15 euros (Sunday closed); - The basic soap in the bathroom does not exist...; General Comments: If you want air conditioning or the kitchen, you need to pay extra (Cheap). The Italy tax must be paid with cash only.

For a family of five the price was just right. Please be aware that this hotel charges extra for use of the kitchen and air conditioning. We paid 10 euros for the air conditioning. This is a nightly rate. Overall, the place was clean, the location very close to the Vatican but a little out of the way to other popular spots.

It is an apartment and has not been updated since the 70's and the walls are made of paper and we could not sleep because of the noise. There were locks on the cabinets, like someone was going to really steal the dishes. The bathroom was horrible, we wore shower shoes because it just had that gross feeling. We are not picky travelers, but this was really bad. There is not even a bar of soap provided. Also, the towels are more like rough, thick sheets, they are not normal towels. The two good things, 1) The guy running the place was nice and helpful. 2) It is less than 2blks to the Vatican.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cIt's an actual apartment. Kinda cute\u201d", "Author": "nikistevens", "ReviewID": "UR82240063", "Content": "We were very happy with our stay here. We came from the south of France which was no were near as big, and friendly. The staff were amazing, they spoke english, very professional even knew who we were when we walked in. They give great advice too. We were surprised when we walked in that it's a small apartment. Bathroom was very small however. If your a big guy and you have the single suite, good luck with fitting in the shower. People complained on tripadvisor about the towels, they are very thin. But HUGE! and white as clean can be. Stop crying you babies. Your in a little gated apt. Community with local italians, so bring earplugs because they get up early, and it's kinda loud. But you can't hear the street. Which was great. Water tank is small, but has a gage on it, so you'll know how much you have. Bring your own soap.!! Restaurants 5 mins away are not touristy, but you little have to walk at least 5 mins towards the Vatican and up a small hill. Good restaurants and Gelato places. Not as expensive as we thought. Well, compared to Paris. It may be a little hard to find from the subway but we found a american who lived right by the hotel, and it's walking distance from the train. And the Vatican/ Great location. You don't even need the trains to get around Rome, just take the very cheap 1 euro busses. Wifi is only 2 euros a day, and I tried to find wifi around the area. Very hard to find one and not reliable. Just pay for theirs it works great!", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "AMLAP", "ReviewID": "UR47723363", "Content": "The apartment building is located near (5 min walk) the Vatican.

We did not want to spend too much as we knew we would be sightseeing all day. The apartment itself was set within an inner courtyard area, behind a large wooden door that lead out on to the road. It was just what we wanted clean and very spacious. Our room looked out on to roof tops. We liked the location, it was excellent, and very close to the underpass leading to St Peters Square. (2 mins walk) We actually walked to most of the sights from the apartment, with the exception of the Rome Forum. We also took the Tour Bus to get round and hopped on and off. /the ticket price was 15 Euros for 24hrs. the nearest stop was St Peters Square. To sum up, don't think you can go wrong with this place, we all liked it. and found it a perfectly acceptable place to stay and the area seemed nice/safe. Tips: Take a few basics with you, teabags, coffee sugar etc. Maybe even a towel?-The towels were acceptable, but just a bit like table cloths!!", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cHell is near The Vatican..\u201d", "Author": "Worldtime", "ReviewID": "UR40466908", "Content": "Photos and webpage look very nice but it is really part of a low middle-class complex of apartments -you cannot see this until you arrive- It is smelly and noisy.
