When I discovered I had booked the Econolodge and then read the terrible reviews I was very concerned. I thought I'd give it a go anyways, and I brought a couple other hotel numbers on standby. I was very pleasantly surprised when I entered the hotel to see a clean and modern reception area, and I was assisted by a very friendly and efficient employee. My room was clearly updated quite recently, with dark wood furniture, including a large armoire for storing my suitcase. The carpets, curtains, etc. were all in excellent repair, the bathroom was basic but very clean, and there was no odour at all in the hallway or my room. The free breakfast consists of juice, coffee, cereal and bagels- not a lot, but a quick way to start your day. The breakfast room was also clean and modern, with newspapers available, and a small TV screen showing the days' news. There is also free wi-fi throughout. That being said, I will make a couple of suggestions. As others have mentioned, there are three floors, and no elevators. If you're traveling with heavy luggage/multiple pieces/elderly/disabled/young children, CALL AHEAD and request a floor on the first room. Also, some of the rooms face Jarvis, which has steady traffic. A $2 pair of earplugs could change your experience from a lousy stay to a relaxing and issue-free one. Or request a room on the other side of the hotel. Overall, I would say this is a fine two star hotel. It is not glamorous, but 2-stars very rarely are. It is a basic, central and adequate place to crash, and you can't beat the price.

The room itself was nothing special as expected for the price, and the quality of sleep was not great due to road noise and thin insubstantial pillows.

Amusingly, the cleaning staff also apparently missed the fact that a previous guest had covered the peep hole in the door with chewing gum. Overall the experience would have been fairly tolerable if it weren't for the keycard 'malfunction ' and the fact that we didn't anticipate the lack of an elevator. It's possible that we weren't intentionally locked out of the room, but why else would both keycards suddenly become inactive? They weren't rubbed on any magnets or anything like that.

I would NEVER recommend this hotel to a family, quiet couple, or homosexuals. It may be alright if you are a single person who can tolerate poor service, excessive noise, and the red-light district. Other than that, I'd recommend spending an extra dollar and trying someplace else like the Bond Place hotel.

Being a solo male traveller location and room were fine. Its cheap, just keep telling yourself that. Brek is fine, several loaves, peanut butter, cheese, jelly, coffee, jiuice, cereal, but you do feel you are eating in a hotel lobby. I probably wouldnt stay there again as i would look for somewhere better.

Our only choice was the Econo Lodge. The room was small but that wasn't the problem. There were cigarette burns and filth on the carpet, I didn't even want to take my shoes off. There were cigarette burns on the base of every lamp, on the bathroom vanity, on the toilet lid. The upper window was open with no screen in it and we could only close it part way. In the morning I went to use the hair dryer after my shower and it wouldn't work. I called the front desk and proceeded to ask for assistance and was hung up on before I could finish. I called back and the fellow said he had no idea how to make it work. By that time my hair was drying on its own so I made do with some hair spray. Upon closer examination I noticed the reason the dryer wouldn't work - whoever created the burns must have left a cigarette burning close to the cord of the dryer because it was burnt through to the wires. A definate safety hazard, couldn't believe the staff didn't know about this. The best part about the room was the bed, it was quite comfortable. I emailed the link on their websites for comments concerning their facilities but all I have recieved is a form email saying someone would get back to me and I've received nothing else. Don't stay here.

We ended up paying $13 a day for parking in a lot three blocks away - no big problem, but if we'd known to factor in the parking cost, we might have chosen to stay elsewhere. The room itself was okay, aside from a few minor cigarette burns in carpet and blanket - had to carry suitcases up to second floor since no elevator, but we were fine with that. After the first day, we ignored the free breakfast - can't get excited about a few semi-stale bread choices, three cereals, and weak orange juice. Location is about a fifteen minute walk from interesting downtown sites - no problem if you're a good walker. Location is a bit marginal - the area to the west has a university and feels mostly okay; the area to the south has other hotels and feels mostly okay. But just half a block to the east you run into a homeless area that feels definitely more unsafe.

That is one thing that really gets to me when I stay at a place. At that point I chose to not look too closely at the room environment. On the plus side, the queen bed was very comfortable and firm. The facilities were modern enough with no plumbing problems or anything. Also, the TV had a lot of channels and was big, if you care about those things. There is no elevator, but only has two floors anyway. Front desk staff was pretty aloof. The breakfast was very basic, but at least had bagels with cream cheese and OJ. I have had much worse for the free continental breakfast. All in all it is passable for a night or two and good enough for budget-minded people.
