Absolutely the worst mistake we could have made.

Our shower had either no cold water (first 2 days of our stay), clogged drains (all of our stay), or no hot water (any time between midnight and 5am). Some windows in the rooms have newspapers stuck around the frames instead or sealing gaskets or insulation, resulting in noise all the time. Housekeeping staff congregated outside our rooms to chat in the early mornings, waking us up every time. Lamps in the rooms were broken or hanging from the walls, TV cable service and remote controls dated and non-functioning, and to top it off absolutely no way to get through to top management so they can fix the issues or at least apologize. We were moved to a different \"better\" room on our last night but by then the damage to our holiday had been done.

In fact two of the latter, which may have been one more than optimal. Thus, I was pleased to be booked in there for my latest trip: it turns out that while not exactly cheap, the Camino is no longer (it appears) quite in the top rank of Mexican hotels price-wise. Rooms start at around US$130 plus 18.5% taxes on the weekends. The Camino\u2019s key draw is it\u2019s architecture: opened in 1968, it was designed by one of Mexico\u2019s most prominent architects and features a sort of earthy take on modernism with clear indigenous elements. As design, it has stood up well. The semi-enclosed courtyard entry with its round \u201cwave pool\u201d fountain at centre, its pink latticed screen dividing it from the street and the supersized, stone-framed chairs alongside the driveway provides an arresting entrance. These are followed by an entry through an ancient pair of church doors to a sculpture-laden lobby from which open bars, the reception area and a broad stairway to the upstairs restaurants and bars. There are several of the latter, serving a range of cuisines and, on limited acquaintance, they reach a pretty good standard: Excellent guacamole and traditional duck mole on the first night and, more surprisingly perhaps, an ability to produce European standards properly - a fine eye fillet in green peppercorn sauce, cooked rare as ordered and accompanied by a very good Faustino Reserva Rioja. The rooms themselves are arranged around a pretty internal garden, with a pool and terrace at one end. Tip: spend an extra $25 a night for a garden view room, which will give you the aforesaid view and be a lot quieter - the hotel is located on a main street. Those on the ground floor open to the garden \u2013 but this means that you may not want to leave your sliding door open to the cool night air. This is a problem, because the airconditioning system seems to be a case of much sound and fury, signifying nothing. In fact, I moved rooms after the second night as, not only did my aircon seem to be impervious to human commands, half of the (barely adequate) lighting in my room was non-functional. Unfortunately, while the lights in the new room initially all worked (one blew a couple of days later, as had one in the first room) the aircon situation was unimproved. This brings me to the key point about the Camino: as the price drop suggests, it is in the latter phase of the cycle through which major hotels pass between renovations. It\u2019s a little hard to tell how long it has been since the last, but the pink slate bathrooms show evidence of neglect, in that the slate in the showers hasn\u2019t been resealed and has taken on milky white staining as a consequence, giving them a grimy appearance. The tapware is worn, with flaking chrome and just about functioning sink plugs, and so on. The rooms lack modern conveniences such as IPod docks or broader IPod connectivity. Wifi is available, but costs almost $15/day, reducible to only (?) $10/day by taking a weekly package, and suffers from poor speed and \u2013 in some rooms at least \u2013 poor signal strength. I gather that the latter is not quite as cynical as it seems, as Mexico suffers from the expensive and poor quality telecoms services that are the result of a poorly regulated quasi-monopoly. Service is generally good, although my initial requests for lightbulbs to be replaced went unanswered. The rooms are of a good size, with desk and armchair, large beds and wardrobs/drawers. Pleasingly, ironing facilities are provided, though \u2013 annoyingly \u2013 tea and coffee making facilities are not. On the subject of beds \u2013 the mattresses appear to be old-style feather ones (as are the pillows) and have a fair bit of \u201cgive\u201d in them. The second I slept in was OK, but the first caused some problems for my middle-aged and not entirely healthy back. Of course, renovating a hotel like the Camino \u2013 which must be something of a national treasure \u2013 presents some issues and needs to be done sensitively. Personally, I wonder if some research aimed at recreating original features in areas such as the bathrooms and the room furnishings might not be the best idea: i.e sell the hotel as something which is a complete time capsule and is as true as possible to the original architect\u2019s vision. Even though that implies retaining the purple carpet in the rooms. But whichever way this is done, modernising the failing electrical and airconditioning systems is a must if the sort of consumer comfort that people want, even at this mid/high price point, is going to be delivered. Bottom line? If you have any interest in architecture, or even just want to stay in a hotel that gives you a sense of place, rather than the anonymous 5 star standard where you don't know what country you're in - you shouldn\u2019t miss the Camino. Just be prepared for a few compromises along the way. Postscript: If you go to their website, you\u2019ll find that this hotel has spawned a chain, as have other famous hotels around the world (eg the Raffles). So make sure it is the Camino Real Polanco you book. Unfortunately, you will get no sense of the architecture from the pictures on offer on the website.

I remember my first visit as being blown away by the cool architecture, the amazing fountain in the entranceway, the bar made out of solid ice in the lobby where they served great martinis. Boy has that all gone now. I arrived at midnight after a 22 hour flight from Singapore and was made to queue for at least 30-40 minutes ot check in. A huge group of conference delegates was checking in ahead of me and only two people were serving at the counter - surely they knew in advance these people were coming. By the way check out was not much faster even though I checked out around 10:30am. I hate to think what it must be like at peak times! The rooms are certainly tired. Like another reviewer, my safe did not work, and the shower seemed to alternate between hot and cold water. Breakfast was a crazy rush of people with a relatively poor choice given the price. WiFi costs 10USD per day in your room and bottled water 4USD. I only ordered room service and to be honest the food as not too bad but there were isues. I ordered Italian salad and got Caprese. My minestrone was luke warm and the pizza a little soggy. My experience of the staff was not as bad as some reviewers. The guy ordering me a taxi was the same one I recall from 3-4 years ago and he was always friendly and helpful. Front desk staff, when oyu finally got to them, were reasonably helpful too.

Plus I've found many travelers allow their negative experiences in Mexico City as a whole to unfairly color their views of individual places so I stupidly dismissed the overall low ratings. In this case however the bad reviews are correct and I now regret being such a lazy snob about the whole thing. Before I get into my specific complaints, let me be general: This is a gigantic, impersonal business/convention-oriented hotel. And if you're into that sort of thing (I'm not), I'm sure you can do much better in Mexico City. The location is not in Polanco, as it says in their name, and you have to cross several busy streets to get there. I'm fairly fit and used to the city's smog, altitude, and traffic and I still found it a haul. Chapultepec Park is across the street, technically, but there's a giant sports complex with high walls separating you from it. You have to walk at least a half mile to find an actual entrance. Like many others, I was partially lured by the architecture, which is unique and somewhat interesting, but the overall effect is a dated, avant garde mega mall. Alienating and very cold, not cool and luxurious as the photos make it out to be. But most of that is subjective. What's not subjective is the the front desk service, which is the worst I've ever encountered. Let me repeat: it's the worst I've ever encountered. We arrived late after booking a \"deluxe\" room and were given a room on a busy street that stank of smoke. This is a massive hotel and the walk from the lobby to the room was at least a third of a mile -- I'm not joking -- and after a full day's travel I wasn't in the mood to march all the way back. So I called the front desk to ask for a different room and was put on hold. I waited 15 minutes and then hung up and made the trip back anyway. The man behind the desk was courteous yet dismissive, saying his hands were tied because I'd booked through Orbitz. He had no idea what a \"deluxe\" room was and said the hotel was completely full. Too tired to argue (it was close to midnight), I surrendered but asked if I could have my room changed for the rest of my trip. He said he would make a note and told me to come back in the morning. I went back to my smoky room and ordered a pizza from room service, which frankly wasn't bad, though somewhat lukewarm, likely because of the aforementioned long walk. The TV remote barely worked, there's no art on the walls, and they charge US$4 for the bottled water. After being woken up by loud traffic at 6:00 am (business travelers note: windows are not soundproofed and surrounding streets are loud), I called the front desk and again was put on hold. So I got ready and went to the front desk at 8:00. I was \"greeted\" gruffly by a distracted, stone-faced young woman. There was no note requesting a room change, so I asked if this could be accomplished, repeating my complaints. She told me to come back at 1:00 pm. Was there any way they could at least confirm a change was possible? No. The hotel was full. ...But then what would change at 1:00? Could they not simply promise me a smoke-free, quieter room? No... Maybe... I don't know. I asked for a manager and instead another desk person of equal rank came to help, slightly friendlier. She said they'd write a note. I told her my last \"note\" hadn't worked out too well, and explained my frustration. She shrugged her shoulders (literally) and explained there was nothing they could do. I asked for a manager again, and was given one. He at least made eye contact and wasn't attempting to do three other things while attending to me, as the other desk people so far had done. He was apologetic but told me, again, that his hands were tied since the reservation had been made through Orbitz. I told him I'd paid extra for a \"deluxe\" room and again he told me he had no idea what that meant, but went into a long, convoluted explanation of room types available at the hotel. I told him I simply wanted confirmation I'd be moved to a quiet, smoke-free room, and after some discussion, he \"found\" another room (in a supposedly full hotel), but said it was still on the street, \"but a quiet one.\" I had taken an early morning hike around the circumference of the property and I assure you, the Camino Real Polanco (actually Anzures) has no such thing adjoining it. I told him I wanted an inside room and after much tapping at his computer console, he told me they were all booked. I told him I was checking out and to cancel the remainder of my reservation, at which point he \"found\" an inside room but told me I'd have to pay for an upgrade. I told him to cancel the remainder of my reservation and he offered to upgrade me for free. I was tired of Let's Make a Deal, tired of him, tired of the Camino Real and $40 worth of calls to Orbitz later, I was able to check out and receive a refund. The long calls were not due to Orbitz, but because -- yup -- they (and thus we) were on hold for 20 minutes waiting to speak to a (higher-level) manager. Mexico City is a wonderful, fascinating place and Chilangos are some of the friendliest, most charming people on earth. Camino Real must have really had to go out of their way to staff this place with people who are quite the opposite.

I must say that although I did not expected much of it (having read some reviews before I arrived), I was disappointed by it, for the following reasons : - The rooms are quite small, and dark. Their walls are painted in a yellow - brown color which is rather depressing, and did not help me relax after a day of work. The TV is old and the reception not very good. - the bathroom is not very convenient : you cannot set the strength of the shower so you cannot prevent water from going everywhere. Besides, there must have been a problem with the sewer because I was woken up 2 nights in a row by a very strong smell coming out from the shower. I had to let water flow for a few minutes and lock the door of the bathroom in order to get back to sleep. - the staff at the reservation offce was down right stubborn : they refused to let us leave for a week end and keep our rate (we were supposed to stay 1 month, and intended to leave Mexico City for 1 or 2 week-ends). So after 2 days trying to negociate, as we couldn't even talk to the sales manager, we just cancelled our reservation and left for the Hotel Nikko which is much much better.

Their staff for the most part is friendly and accommodating and the service has been above par. While the hotel product is dated and needs refurbishment, the rooms are spacious and the ones facing the garden are quiet. One of several comments I have is the design of the hotel is not accommodating to people with handicaps or people carrying suitcases - there are steps everywhere and virtually no ramps. To get from the guest rooms to many of the restaurants one has to take an elevator to the lobby then go up several flights of stairs - there is no way to access the restaurants by elevator from the guest rooms. With the 24/7 global nature of the world now, this upscale hotel in a major world city also needs to start catering to those hours. The gym for example closes at 10 PM and the pool closes at 7. Most gyms at least in major city hotels are open 24/7 and the pools are open at least until 10 if not 24/7 as well (with key access only after a certain hour). The worst evidence of this was on my stay there earlier this month. For some reason, the wireless internet in my room went down after I came back from dinner (it had been working earlier). After several rebooting attempts to no avail I called the front desk to see if I could get a cable and try that way. It took them over 45 minutes to find a cable for me - something which should be a standard fixture in the room in any case. When that didn't work I asked to speak to tech support and was told that there was no one at the hotel who could help me at that hour (it was around midnight). When I asked if they didn't have a 24/7 tech support call line, I was told they did not. This was unacceptable to me as I had about 2 hours of ahead of me as I work with India which was in the middle of their day. I spoke with the Manager on Duty and said that this was unacceptable. He came to my room to see if he could fix the problem and was also somehow able to contact a tech support person (even though supposedly there was no one available at that hour) who also tried to fix the problem and was also unable to fix the problem. We tried different guest rooms to see if that helped and I still had the same problem. When I asked if anyone else had complained about the internet they said no but it could also be because by that time it was getting close to 1 AM. As a last ditch effort we took my computer to the lobby to see if I could have computer access in the lobby and lo and behold it worked. So 2 1/2 hours after I had first called with the problem I was finally able to access the internet. I spent from 1:30-3:30 AM sitting at the guest relations desk answering e-mails (there was also another guest in the lobby doing the same thing) and ended up getting just 4 hours of sleep before my long work day. The Manager on Duty asked what they could do to compensate for the inconvenience and I asked for permission to use the Executive Floor lounge which he did give me. However, after the frustrations of the evening I as hoping I would have had note from the general manager waiting for me in my room the next day - but nothing more was done. The hotel needs to gear up for today's world where business is conducted around the clock. They need to have access to tech support that is able to help anytime night or day, have cables available in the rooms if the wireless does not work and have longer hours in the gym and pool. They also need to redisgn the hotel to make access easier with small suitcases - where we don't necessarily need the services of the bell staff-and also to people with disabilities.

The hotel was also on a good rate, which is why I chose an executive room, which featured larger rooms and access to the executive lounge. Check-in was fairly trouble-free, on the 5th floor at the executive lounge. Upon check-in for the executive rooms, you get free complimentary dry-cleaning and shoe shining service, which was a welcome perk after trudging my work clothes on our holiday to Mexico and in preparation for my meetings the next day. Other perks include complimentary breakfast buffet at the lounge (somewhat small selection, but adequate) and afternoon drinks and snacks, which were very good. The hotel itself is very interesting architecturally and has striking bars and outdoor areas. The swimming pool area is also very nice. Our room was massive, with possibly the largest bed I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen in a hotel. The room was also quiet, and you could keep the windows open and still hear limited noise from the street. Bathroom was nice, with a good selection of toiletries. All was going very well until the time we were returning to our room after dinner on the second nice. As we were heading towards the elevators a security guy stopped us in order to check that we were guests. Until then, I thought ok, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a security spot check. I gave him our room number and surname, which he found on his printout. At that point I thought he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d thank us, but no, he scanned the sheet until he found the number of guests in the room: 2, and only then did he let us go! I found this completely unacceptable as it implied he thought my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 might have been a prostitute. To make matters worse, as he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153questioning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd us, loads of other (male) guests were walking past unchallenged. He specifically picked on us as we were a couple! This brings me to another question: is this hotel so sleazy they feel the need to check if every good looking young woman is a prostitute?

Then why not check on the male guests!? Needless to say, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve knocked 3 stars off on account of this otherwise good hotel.

This was our first experience in Mexico City so we thought a large hotel near some cultural facilities would be ideal. We wanted to save a few bucks after spending two weeks in Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands and this place was just the ticket. The hotel was built in 1968. For such an old hotel it is in exceptionally good condition. There are six restaurants, a few shops and a huge comfortable lobby. There are over 700 rooms so be prepared to walk! We arrived early and our room was not ready. No big deal we thought, so we left our bags with the concierge and went for lunch. The buffet was quite nice albeit quite expensive. We paid about $75 for lunch for the two of us, at a buffet! Our room was ready exactly when we were told it would be. We had a nice gentleman show us to our room which was great. We would have been lost without him. Not to worry though, once you have been shown the way it is easy to find your way later. He then brought our bags and showed us all the features of the room. The room was a decent size with a large all-marble bathroom. The carpet and bedspread were 'vintage' otherwise the room was nice. The bed was a modern pillow-top, fortunately only the bedspread and throw pillows were old. This is a business hotel at a good price but you will pay dearly for the extras. I didn't mind this as I knew it would happen. The room is a good value and you pay for the extras, rather than paying a lot for the room and having a lot of \"free\" services. The food at the hotel is good but pricey. Room service was excellent but you pay $15 for a burger or clubhouse. Pepsi is $3.00 for a 355 mL can, etc. An unsecured Wireless B network is available in the rooms for $173 Pesos per 24 hour period. Again this is primarily a business hotel, so most folks just expense such 'necessary' things. As is typical in Mexico you tip for everything. When the people are friendly, courteous and don't appear phony I don't mind this. The Camino Real staff were all first class. Chapultepec Park is across the street. You must walk to the lights at the corner to access it but it is a short walk. There are many museums and such at the park including the famous Museum of Anthropology.

I doubt the same could be said for a Marriott or Hilton. The room itself was large (3rd floor). I was initially followed to my room by a hooker who quickly went away after a brief description of what she could do for (to) me.

It has the amenities you'd find at most other major business hotels - WIFI, gym (stocked with cool fruit juices in the mornings), several restaurants, 3 phones, and spacious marble bathrooms in each room. But there are two reasons we'll continue to choose the Camino Real over equivalent hotels: 1. The location, right between 2 colonias, offers an ideal mix -- between the very upscale Colonia Polanco, home to the major European designers boutiques and numerous Starbucks Coffee outlets (with valet parking, no less), and the more lived-in Colonia Anzures, with its neighborhood taquerias, bustling cantinas, and other local businesses. We spent time walking around in both, and enjoyed the quite different experiences each had to offer. The hotel is also just across the street from Chapultapec Park, and an easy walk to the Tamayo and Modern Art Museums. 2. Style. Unlike the tasteful beige universe you'll encounter at most other top-level hotels, the Camino Real draws on design and architectural elements from Mexican culture, and makes a strong style statement - one that, admittedly, might not be to everyone's taste. The common areas and rooms are decorated in Mexico's vibrant pinks, blues, and yellows, and silver and natural wood play leading roles as well in the decor. At the same time, the hotel isn't perfect. WIFI isn't cheap (with taxes, about 150pesos per day), and the carpeting and window fixtures have seen happier days. During one of our stays, we had some issues with local calling, which took about 2-3 days for them to resolve. We also found the breakfasts to be a poor value, unless you're traveling with an expense account or really must have an American-style buffet breakfast. Instead, we enjoyed the very clean, European-style Pasteleria Alcazar (across from the back entrance, on Leibnitz) for coffee/espresso and a wide selection of pastries, or, for a more traditional hearty Mexican breakfast, Los Panchos (two short blocks south, on Tolstoi).

During the day we found the metro safe but beware of rush hour where it can be wall to wall and difficult to enter or exit the cars particularly in the stops near the zocalo.

I got a regular room with a balcony. The balcony was great; however, it overlooked a decorative pool that looked like it was abandoned for months full of leaves okay not big deal but not something you would expect from a LHW. What was really disgusting was the bright green carpeting in our room that looked 20 years old and not vacuumed around the edges. It was so gross I would not walk barefoot. The bedding was gross. The bathroom was marble and large, it was nice but I did not feel it was clean. Minus the bathroom and balcony the room was something you would expect to find in a run down hotel I thought that I got a bad room because I paid only $150 but then I got to my friends room who got a suite and I was horrified. Aside from the bedding which was much nicer than in my room, the suite was even worse than the regular room I had. The carpet was bright purple, crumbs in the corner. Everything was completely outdated and it did not even have a balcony. The first word that comes to mind to describe this room would be skanky. The service by the pool was terrible. The staff was friendly and meant well, but they were very slow and kept on messing up our orders both times we were there. I almost lost my appetite when I opened the menu to find a squashed bug ... nice. What was great about this hotel is that they had many excellent restarants inside the hotel including Le Cirque, Bice, and the China Grill which had a good scene and very cool outdoor bar/lounge called Moon Bar. This was the best part of the hotel and perhaps the only reason I would stay again. The location was not great as I felt trapped in the hotel, but taxi's are cheap. You must have the hotel call a radio taxi which is a third of the cost of a hotel taxi. The W hotel is much better and in a much better location in Polenco. The best restarant I've been to in Mexico City is Ivorie which is about a 5-10 miniute taxi from the hotel.

Use of the club lounge was included, but the food at breakfast was skimpy, the waiter surly on both mornings and the ambiance a bit down at the heels. My room was spacious, but again in need of a facelift. But the real surprise was at checkout, when the hotel's Mexico-peso 'equivalent' of my confirmed US-dollar rate turned out to be about ten per cent higher than the official exchange rate. When I asked about this, the smiling Executive Club receptionist told me that the hotel uses a double exchange rate, one when you book (lower) and one when you pay (higher).

Also since the location of Mariott /W /Nikko is closer to wider choice of restaurants and bars. There are several restaurants and bars available in the Camino Real itself and did try some. Coffeeshop was good, there is a cool bar on water (although smokey) but at the time they did not even have a menu so you have no idea what your drinks are costing until you get the bill. I also tried one of the restaurant (China Grill) -admittingly good food and very creative but expect at least 1000pesos pp. You can eat as good and better for less in some of the better restaurants in Polanco, Condesa and Roma.

The food was excellent and moderately priced, $20USD for two people. We had dinner at a small food court called Cactus Bar which was immaculately clean, inexpensive and had the best tacos I've ever eaten (thanks Don Guerro!). The cost was around $15USD for tacos and beers for two people. We also ate at a very small, romantic Italian restaurant called L'arlecchino. The wood fired pizzas & pasta were excellent. The ambience was perfect (until they turned on the TV!). Service in each of these establishments was excellent. There were also several bars in the area, including an Irish pub, all which were very lively. During the day, we walked a few blocks to Chapultepec Park which is an oasis of green in the city.

I disagree with the comment about the concierges.

We were there 4 nights and stayed on the Club level. Each room cost us $170 dollars (a weekend rate, I think). There was plenty of vacancy, so you might try the internet for a better rate or negotiate to get one. We would have done so had we known how (relatively) empty the hotel was (probably not more than 50-60% full). We were glad to have stayed on the Club level. The hotel, as noted by others below, is beautiful and very comfortable. The architecture is great, the public areas clean and elegant, the restaurants excellent (we ate at the Italian one the first night to avoid having to go out and the food was excellent but perhaps a bit pricey), the rooms spacious and nicely designed. Room service was prompt and good, and housekeeping was very responsive. With three kids, safety was important, and we felt very safe in the hotel and allowed our kids to roam around as necessary. A nice and perfectly adequate breakfast was served each morning on the Club level with meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, fruit, yogurt, etc. It was a nice way to start the day. We were a family of 5 and needed two rooms. As it turned out, while there are connecting rooms on the Club level and elsewhere, we should have spoken directly to the Club level to ensure that our rooms were connecting. Our kids are old enough so that it was not a problem, but it was an annoyance that the left hand did not know what the right was doing (or capable of doing). One negative regarding the hotel is perhaps the location during this protest season. We pretty much felt as if we needed to take a cab or car everywhere. In that sense, it is not as nicely situated as Polanco (some say the hotel is in Polanco, but if it is it is at an extreme border). Regardless, that negative was not great and we would certainly stay at this hotel again and not hessitate to recommend it to others. Finally, we too tried El Fogoncito (behind the hotel).
