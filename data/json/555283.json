The hotel is well located on a quiet street in the Mitte district, a 15 minute walk from Alexander Platz. Although bar and restaurant options in the immediate vicinity are not extensive, there are a few possibilities and some excellent coffee shops and bakeries, and it only takes 10 minutes or so to find some really good eating and drinking options. The location is equally good for sightseeing with Checkpoint Charlie, Potsdamer Platz, Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, Tiergarten, Unter den Linden, Babelplatz, Berliner Dom, Museum Island, the river Spree and of course Alexander Platz easily walkable. The hotel is modern and clean with good sized rooms; we ordered two twin rooms and one single and all had double (ish) beds. The rooms also come equipped with tea & coffee facilities and modern bathrooms and offer comfortable and quiet respite from the city. The hotel staff were helpful and polite, even giving us some ideas about where to go in the evenings.

The hotel is fairly new, very clean with very pleasant and helpful staff. The room I had was large, had 2 Queen sized beds, a desk, sofa, coffee table and LCD TV. There was a good size en-suite. All of it was clean and comfortable. My colleagues and I had a drink in the bar where the lady serving was very nice. The prices were not ridiculous as you would expect in a hotel. Breakfast was functional, on a par with most hotels in the same band as the Courtyard. My only minor gripe is to do with the room TV and Internet. The TV remote in most Marriott hotels for some unknown reason is a nightmare, the buttons don't work properly or they are unresponsive. This is a killer if you're trapped there for business and can't really go out to entertain yourself. Internet access is available through the TV or through BroadBand cable. Don't really understand why they offer a package to have either internet through TV + all movies for Euro 19 or BB line internet Euro 9. Why not BB line internet + TV together in one package? The hotel does not appear to be in a lively area but is only a few minutes walk away from Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall and a generally more touristy area.

There was all the usual stuff but the fruit was lovely and cold, the pastries very fresh and really nice donuts too.

The blackout curtains worked very well, I hate not knowing if it is light outside when I wake up so I kept them open a bit. Also, the room was very warm, I normally need a second duvet but had the window open one night, it did cool down with the a/c but I don't like the noise when it is on overnight. The location is ok, we took the Metro everywhere but we could have walked, I believed the blurb that Berlin is big and sprawling, actually, I don't really think it is.

Turn right out of the front door, walk two short blocks, turn right again onto Zimmerstr., and in a straight line you'll pass Checkpoint Charlie, the Stasi exhibition, the Topography of Terror exhibition with one of the last standing sections of The Wall, and the Martin Gropius Bau. Turn right at the end of that street and Potsdamer Platz is dead ahead. As a side note, if you're feeling adventurous the entrance is literally across the street from the Zimbabwean and Azeri embassies. The rooms are fine. Decent size for Europe; clean; a safe and a minibar, which you can fill; the hotel supplies only a bottle of fizzy water and wisely ignores the London principle that if you open the fridge you've instantly bought everything inside. The on-site restaurant Oleo Pazzo is open for breakfast buffet, lunch and dinner. I had excellent service and can't quibble about the quality, only some of the pricing; the full-tilt breakfast at \u20ac21 was overpriced IMHO, as was the in-house Market.

As for the negatives : \u2022 Marriott still doesn't get the free wifi-for-all thing \u2022 the walls between the rooms are very thin, so if your neighbours speak loudly or are otherwise over-excitable you'll hear plenty of it \u2022 the gym is small and has only a literal handful of machines and some small hand weights \u2022 I could've done without being locked out of my room just after midnight on NY day, as could the other guests.

One other comment not related to the hotel is that Berlin has a Museum Pass for 19 Euros that allows FREE entry for 3 days to many key museums in Berlin, Charlottenburg, and Postdam. It is a great deal and frees you up from standing in line to get tickets. The Courtyard staff did not about it, but you can buy it any of the museums it lets you into (and the concierge desk at the Westin). The Welcome Card lets you travel for the number of days purchased and gives discounts to museums, tours, and boatrides. You still have to stand in line to purchase tickets. Since we were so close to many of the museums we wanted to visit, we got a Museum Pass for 3 days and saw all the nearby museums, and then bought the Welcome Card for 2 days and could travel. It was great! Don't forget to check the lists of museums they each support so you use your passes wisely. One other comment. There is a lot to do and see in Berlin, and it is spread out, though many of the biggies are in the center. Many of the museums are wonderful, eg. the Bode, Pergamon, and Jewish History Museum, and have their descriptions in English too. They all have English audio guides, either free or for 2-3 euros.

Next we got our room, good room 6th floor quiet location. but the safe refused to work and even the staff got locked out of it, the lamp in the room was missing a lamp...so did not work, and when breakfast comes in at 15,18 or 21 Euros..wow, is that expensive....so sorry Marriott only 3 stars from me and I'm being generous cause I'm a fan...", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cSeptember 2011\u201d", "Author": "Greg W", "ReviewID": "UR118985333", "Content": "This was a great, great hotel.

It is just two minutes from the U2 Spittelmarkt subway stop -- particularly useful for tourists -- and a 15-20 walk to the many museums on Museum Insel. There are surprisingly few cafes and restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, but it is only about a 10 minute walk to Gendarmenmarkt or the Nikolaiviertel, which both offer many dining options. On nights when it either rained or we were too tired to go out, we ate in the in-house Mediterranean themed restaurant -- while not gourmet, it was reasonably priced and the food was better than good. The hotel would be improved by having a swimming pool and there were some minor annoyances -- the little in-house market should carry the International Herald Tribune and they provide only limited free wifi (enough to check e-mail, but probably not enough to do serious work).

We were handed a room key and headed up to our room to discover that it was infact a twin room and not a double room as we had booked. We lugged all our luggage back to reception where we were told that they noticed we had booked a double room but that wasn't on the system, there were no available double rooms and that they would come up and push the beds together. We explained that we booked a double room and asked if there was a possibility of being moved to a double room at some point in our visit. The receptionist was incredibly moody and started muttering in German to the lady beside her. She said nothing but eventually just handed us another room key. Luckily this was a double room but unfortunately it was a smoking room (or had been). We are a young couple and don't expect alot from hotels but we do expect to get what we booked, a double non-smoking room, which we didn't receive here and were treated very poorly for asking for what we had paid for. It is understandable that there may have been an oversight and infact there were no double rooms available but the receptionist should have explained this when we checked in and not just hoped we wouldn't notice on entering our room.

We were able to get a great price and it served us well throughout our trip. The staff were very friendly and the room was immaculate.

You're in a position to get to most tourist destinations in Berlin within 10-15 minutes on the local U-bahn and there's a Lidl nearby for when you want a little bit of shopping. And you'll need to use the Lidl because *crikey* are the hotel amenities expensive. Want to buy a bottle of Diet Coke from the little hotel shop? You're looking at several Euros. The hotel restaurant was horrible. Incredibly expensive for the offering and the worst dining experience we had in Berlin. I did, however, like the bed and the bathroom in our room. While I wasn't convinced that the air conditioning worked as well as it should have, I was glad that the fridge wasn't full of the usual minibar fare, but instead empty and unassuming except for a tasty bottle of sparkling water (thank you!). This allowed us to stock up on some Berlin treats from local supermarkets at a reasonable price. Aside from the room there's not that much to do at the hotel. If you desperately need internet then make sure you bring a device with an ethernet port because the rooms don't offer a WiFi connection. This is the first hotel I've been to in Europe (and I've been to some horrible hotels) without a WiFi connection in the room. If you want WiFi you get an hour free in the lobby every day. After that you have to pay for a premium connection. This was not ideal and I found myself clocking up more time in the lobby than I would have liked and some data roaming charges precisely because I left my laptop at home under the mistaken assumption that the rooms had WiFi.

I should say that after we called Hotels.com (using international roaming on our phone of course) to prove that the offer was valid and had been part of our reservation, the Courtyard staff did provide the bottle of champagne, but it was too late as we'd already cancelled our second night and moved to the Swissotel where the difference in service was night and day.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIdeal Location\u201d", "Author": "GFM_59", "ReviewID": "UR88075060", "Content": "Combined a business trip with a weekend in Berlin.

We stayed here again in August 2010, at the end of a trip combining business and family vacation. I was very disappointed and have no interest in returning here. The main reason we booked here was that we wanted a clean, quite hotel with air-conditioning so that we could get a good night's sleep before the flight back to the States. The room they gave us was not as spacious or as bright as the room we had in 2007, but worst of all was that the AC didn't work well--it seemed to be set for not getting colder than 28 C (or 82 F), and so the room was hot and stuffy. In 2007 there had also been a problem with the AC--they had to move us twice before they found a room with a working AC, but at that time I had chalked it up to an unusual heat wave; now it is apparent that it is an unreliable system. (Note: we stayed in many hotels in Germany that didn't have AC and those places were fine, but when you are expecting it and paying for it, it should work.) The other problem with this hotel is that it has no wi-fi. The connections to the internet are all cable, so if you need to pick up email or use internet on your phone or iPad, you are out of luck. Again, we stayed at some very simple hotels in Germany that had wi-fi, sometimes free. Even Marriott's competitors--Hilton and Radison Blu--have wi-fi, and the Radisson's if free. It was just not a welcoming place this time. We had requested a roll-away bed for our son, but it was not there when we arrived and we had to request it again, and then wait around for it. At every other hotel we stayed at, his bed was made up already, and that was very welcoming.

We had booked a room during the world cup through h*tels.com and when we arrived it looked like the proprietors (greedy harpies btw) had painted a crack house and called it a hotel. So I had some mild trepidation on returning to Berlin. Of course, we went with a large chain this time, and I was quite pleased with the Courtyard Marriott. This place looks brand new. I am always amazed with the German work ethic. I saw one of the staff outside with a tub pulling grass that had grown too high between the cobbles. That attention to detail is a luxury in europe really. Let me break down the Pros/Cons for you: PROS: Amazingly friendly staff. They went above and beyond to orient us to the area and point out locations. Anytime we had a question about the area they pulled out a map and started making notes for us so we could get around. Great English too. Clean (as in brand new) appearance. I couldn't find any blemishes in our room and I am as critical as it gets (6th floor btw ). Quiet area. Walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie. Not too far from Spittelmarkt UBahn (subway) stop (maybe 3-4 minutes). You are only a few stops from Potsdamer Platz which is a great place for food, drinks and of course the big live shows. CONS The immediate area feels a bit vacant. So, it's very quiet (which is good), but you have to walk a few minutes to get into an area with lots of food/shops. Also, it is not as well lit as I would have liked at night, but it didn't feel unsafe or anything like that. The breakfast options in the hotel were a bit too pricey for me. However, I am cheap (and the dollar is near worthless) so maybe that's not a problem for you. The contintenal was 14 euros, the full buffet 18 euros. My only problem was the lack of an a-la-carte menu for the breakfast. We just wanted coffee and a croissante. Anyway, we had coffee and they didn't even charge us for that b/c we didn't have the breakfast. We walked a few minutes to Friedrichstasse and had a coffee and bread at the coffeeshop company so no major problem there.

I did not eat the breakfast but the prices seemed a little bit steep when I saw them. I ate dinner in the restaurant and it was good. The front desk staff was friendly...but I have always believed your attitude makes a difference when dealing with all people. I used the U-Bahn station which was about a 2 minute walk. I stayed in Berlin Thursday night through Sunday morning. I stayed out late on Friday night and Saturday night. The U-Bahn line is open all night on the weekends. My only caution here, much like I read in some of the other reviews...is to get to the local U-Bahn station, you have to walk through what appears to be a couple abandoned buildings. I felt OK about this as I am a male. If I were a female wanting to use the subway late at night....I would not feel too comfortable walking to the station alone. It's probably safe, but I would advise my female friends to stay at a hotel in a more tourist populated area. Of cousre, if you are a woman and going to use a cab, then it's not an issue late at night. I get the feeling this street is transitioning and eventually will be a great street with more restaurants, etc. Given that, I was very satisfied with this hotel. It's a pretty easy walk to get to Checkpoint Charlie Museum which is one of the big tourist attractions(about a 10 minute walk).

We both asked the lady at the front desk (I should have got her name so that i could've complained to hotel management) to call us from the lobby if our room was ready since we had just taken an early flight from Venice (6am) and needed to freshen up so we could walk around the city.

We like Courtyard hotels for vacations in the US and liked this one very much, too. The location is great: it's tucked in an old East Berlin neighborhood of tall apartment buildings that had overlooked the wall, so it is interesting and reminds you that not all is glitz and glamour, and the Berliners you pass in the neighborhood are friendly. Checkpoint Charlie is a short distance away. Subway is only a block away--on the main U2 line that brings you just about anywhere. It is a 10 minute walk to the Gendarmenmarkt and another 5 to Unter den Linden. Hotel is immaculate and comfortable and quiet. Staff is very friendly and always willing to help you improve your German (rather than looking at you in disdain and then answering in English!). It is a great deal. They were great about setting up a roll-away bed for our son, and the maids would arrange his stuffed animals in a very sweet way and even wrote \"Danke\" on the note pad because we left a tip everyday. We had only a couple negative experiences in two weeks: (1) when we arrived on a day of 95 degree F heat, they said our room would not be ready until 3:00, at which time it was guaranteed. We understood and so had lunch in the pleasant restaurant there. But at 3:00 there was still no room to be had and the receptionist was very nervous about that. Someone senior to her then suddenly \"found\" a room which was \"king bed, non-smoking, and quiet, as you requested.\" What she didn't say was that the AC wasn't working, which I suspect (but cannot prove of course) she knew. So we spent a horrible night there. The next night they moved us to another room; the AC was barely working there, so we had another awful night. On the third day they moved us to yet another room, which was cool and comfortable and where we remained happily for the rest of the stay. (2) although I thought I had double-checked the bill at check-out, I realized that someone had charged breakfast to our room for 48 Euros. But through Customer Service's help back here in the States, that has been corrected and we should be receiving credit. Advice: (1) we found the breakfast to be outrageously expensive. For 12 Euros ($17) you got the cheapest buffet, which was just rolls and jams, and coffee, and cheeses (not my personal favorite at breakfast)--but not cereals or juice, and certainly not anything hot. Not including juice in a buffet was just too cheap. Since all my son ate was one little broetchen with butter, the waitress was kind enough not to charge him 12 E. But after that we filled the little refridgerator in our room with juice, milk and jam; we went around the corner to the local bakery to get fresh rolls for 1.40 Euros (and the man there was super friendly and would also give tips for my German and Berlin slang); and then we got coffee from the machine in the lobby for 1.50 euros. Much cheaper, and much less fattening! We also discovered that a 10 minute walk brought you to Einstein KAffee on the Gendarmenmarkt, where you can get a big creamy latte and a croissant for 4.50 Euros. (2) The refridgerator was one reason we chose the hotel, since we were going to be there a while with a child. The other reason was the \"laundry facilities\" which had been listed on the web site. In the US, Courtyard hotels have washers/dryers. Unfortunately, in this case that meant sending your laundry out for 8 euros a shirts and 80 cents per pair of underwear. With no coin-operated facilities to be found, we wound up washing a lot by hand. (3) The restaurant we didn't use too much, because we wanted to go to different neighborhoods throughout Berlin, but when we did go there we were pleased--the food was very fresh and tasty and actually reasonable (unlike the breakfast). The small Greek salad was a delicious meal in itself. The wait staff is especially friendly. (4) The website had also originally said \"free wireless in lobby.\" That didn't prove to be the case (they have computers, but you have to pay). But what the hotel does offer is free slow connection in your room, which was great, especially in comparison to how much another hotel chain charged us in Munich. It made it difficult to upload some business files, in which case we had to pay a little for the faster connection, but for checking emails and news it was great.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "milton keynes", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay in berlin\u201d", "Author": "Jose B", "ReviewID": "UR8354461", "Content": "Stayed here for four nights at the end of july.

New MB taxis have a meter in the inside mirror. Ok i came by U Bahn and I asked people about Axel Springer Strasse. There is a big building of Axel Springer (Morgenposten etc) and if you ask only that street you might get quite far away from your hotel. The hotel really is near Spittal Markt metro station but there is not any sign of Marriott to show that you have to walk through between some buildings at very near.

There are both Check Point Charlie and the high radiotower of east side city easily reachable also by walking. The staff of the hotel was very friendly and helpful.
