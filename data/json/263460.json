As stated, the rooms are individually owned, so quality can vary. A lot of the rooms have totally absentee owners, so they are reluctant to do due diligence on the standards of their rooms. I guess if you have some slovenly types in before you, who live in a Pig Sty at home, then they are NOT going to care about YOUR cleanliness issues after they leave. However the room I stayed in,(205) was excellent with good amenities and clean towels and bed linen. No noisy neighbours or late night shouting in the Halls. They are Efficiencies, so YES, you do have to take out your own Trash and use the Laundry Room on 1st Floor for washing your clothes or Towels, depending on the length of your stay. The locatiion is unbeatable....right on the Beach...I even bought a Fishing Pole. Daytona Beach Shores Police also have a ZERO Tolerance to Vagrants or Panhandlers. So you never get hassle on that score. Winn Dixie is just across the street and down 400 yards. There is also a neat little Bar next door to Winn Dixie with a great selection of Beers from around the World. Would I stay there again?

It will also be our last. In fact, we left two days early. Our room was nothing like what appeared on the internet. It was shabby and poorly maintained. The housekeeping staff left towels but no washcloths our first night there. Security was nonexistant. No hotel staff was at the desk from 5pm until the next morning. The side entrance from the parking lot wasn't locked nor was there a secuity guard present. Anyone could have wandered in overnight. Our second morning at the hotel we discovered our car was missing! We had placed the hotel placard as instructed so we assumed our car had been stolen. My husband called the hotel emergency number, but no one ever responded. It wasn't stolen, but towed. Even though it was obvious we were registered guests, our car was towed!! After cab fees to go to the towing company and paying to get our car back, we spent $250. We talked to the front desk staff about the situation, but were told it was the condo association that was responsible for cars being towed. According to the staff, the condo association had a contract with the towing service. We asked for information to contact someone at the association, but it was never provided. The bottom line is that the hotel staff was unresponsive to our situation. While the beach was nice, it did not make up for the terrible conditions at the hotel and our car being unfairly towed. This is not a hotel for families. It is dirty, there is no security, the staff is unresponsive and the area nearby has adult stores and a gentlemen's club.

Under the night stand was old ceramic tiles, a half sack of cement and an old cushon from a sofa.? I realized this is a storage closet. One floor lamp leaned 4 or 5 inches to one side. The table lamp's shade was completely off the wire rack that held it up. Got the picture yet? GROSS! The best is yet to come.

In our hurry to check out what was happening, we knocked the parking pass off the mirror and onto the floor of the car. Some time in the next hour they towed our car away.

The other good news (maybe): the door opened. The room was large, with a king bed, a couch, a chair, and a table with two chairs. It had a kitchenette with a new fridge and microwave as well as a two-burner hot plate clearly left over from the 1960's (likely the last time the hotel was updated and, perhaps, cleaned.) The king bed would have been lovely if not for the presence of our 12 year old daughter. We briefly debated the issue, checked to see if the sofa was hiding a sleeper (nope), and decided that sleeping three-to-a-bed was a better option than encountering Her Rudeness again. The 12 year old glanced at the bathroom and announced she would not be showering there which, given the mold on the shower curtain, was probably a good choice. The one blanket in the closet was probably purchased along with the hot plate and was scratchy and nasty. The bed felt sandy. Because of a near-hurricane level storm, the pool was cold and closed early. We did not try the restaurant or the bar and have no regrets about that.

I can tell you I will never be back (to Castaway's Beach that is). Upon check in (11:30pm) we were greated at the front desk by a person that had absolutly no personality. Once we got our key we made ou way to the elevators. Upon entering the elevator the door closed and the elevator dropped down suddenly, not far but enuff to scare the *&#$ out of you. Also we noticed both elevators had expired inspection certificates from Volusa County. We stayed on the 4th floor. Upon entering our room we noticed a \"stink\" almost of stale air and bug spray. The carpets were filthy, the floor by the door was sticky and there was dirt and crumbs in the corners. The bathroom sink wouldn't drain unless you wiggle the stopper. The fridge was leaning back, almost as if it was missing the two back feet, although it did keep the beer cold. The room had a stove top and a microwave which worked well. The lighting was horrible, but probably strategic as I don't think you want to see this room with good lighting. The shower floor was gross and the bathroom towels were not much better. Fortunatly I had brought towels to wipe down the motorcycles. (We used those to dry off and used the hotel towels to clean the bikes) The closet door had one door on and the other was laying inside the closet. There was a vacuum in the clost almost suggesting if you want it clean DO IT YOURSELF!!! The drapes were hanging off the curtain rod. The beds were fairly comfortable, but didn't dare pull the sheets back to see what condition the matress was in. The TV Worked, however very small. Oh did i mention the carpets were dirty. My white socks were almost black after only a few minutes of walking on this floor. Late at night / Early Morning upon entering the bathroom and turning the lights on, the residents are very surprised to see you and scamper for shelter. (ROACHES)!!!! That explains the bug spray smell. On Friday I received a call from Houskeeping asking if I wanted more towels, I said yes. As of now I still have NOT received my towels. The hotel was under construction at the time, however I was not at all disturbed by it. I was there to party so I didn't spend much time at the Hotel, just to rest a couple hours overnight. Thank GOD I went with another male friend. If I had taken my wife and daughterI would have checked out minutes after check in!!! If you want a cheap place to stay(SPRING BREAK, Bike week, Biketoberfest, ETC) and don't mind the simple things like clean floors, bug spray, and dirty towels then OK. But don't expect much at all.

It rained the entire time, but between Mango's (the resident restaurant/grill) and other activities we were able to make the most of our vacation. It's true that the staff is very lackadaisical about things, but this is pretty common in most beach areas, especially when teens are part of the staff. One thing to note about staying at this hotel is that you pay for your room at check in. While it wasn't a big deal, it did catch me a little off guard. It's just a different practice than what I'm used to, but I'd planned to pay it at some point. It's actually kinda nice paying up front when you're on a budget. The view was more than I expected; we stayed in an Oceanview Studio and were located right on the far left corner. We had a view of the ocean, pool, the parking lot and the golf course across the street. Our neighbor was a resident at the Castaways and he was very friendly. He talked to us about the area, and all the good places to go. As we hung out in Mango's every night, we found that year-round residents at The Castaways are common. Everyone we met in Mango's from the staff, to the locals were nice in every possible way. The room itself was pretty nice -- we had a refrigerator, microwave, dresser, table and sitting area. There were also dishes and utensils for use if we needed them. The bathroom was set up so that the only thing enclosed was the shower and toilet -- the sink is in the foyer and features somewhat of a dressing area. There was no mold in our bathroom, and the floor tiles were decent. Some of the furnishings were old, but everything in our room was presentable, and in fine working condition. My only gripe was the hard bed, but again -- for the price I paid nightly for the room, I was more than happy to have it. Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about The Castaways.
