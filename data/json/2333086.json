The room was quiet and I got a good nights sleep. It is a little out of the town but then if it was closer it would be very expensive like all other Amsterdam hotels.

They have good size lockers for rent - 5 euros per day - this was handy as you'll want to store your bags while you see the city awaiting checkin at 3. The neighbourhood is lovely - we were always glad to escape the city centre - a bit too tourist-tacky at times, and return to this part of town. Tram 25 stops right outside the door. Le Pain Quotidien just up Bolstraat is a great place for a coffee and pastry. When you come out the door of the hotel, go left and at the end of the block is a great pizza place.

I believe for an extra cost you can have your room cleaned, extra towels, WiFi access and there is lockers to store your luggage. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English (which was good because my Dutch is not so good). I would say that the hotel is slightly off the beaten track - however transport links in Amsterdam are fantastic and it only took 10minutes on a tram to Dam Square.
