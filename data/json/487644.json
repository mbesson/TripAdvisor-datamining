We were in room 309 which appeared slightly larger than some other rooms. It was very modern clean and loads of room (the view from the window wasnt much but thats not the reason we went there). This is a good location for a city break in Barcelona which itself is ineresting and loads to do (just be careful with your belongings). I was dissappointed in the standard of food generally in the city but there are loads of choices (try and avoid the main tourist areas for dinner esp down at the Port). If you have booked into the Zenit you should be happy with the hotel - its in a quiet residential area (there is a cafe bar across the street at the corner , when you order a vodka he just pours and forgets to stop). There is a good supermarket 2mins down the street and a really good fruit and veg shop just around the corner. We had room only so didnt eat in the hotel but they did a very good 3 course meal for 15 euro. The location is about 25mins walk to the centre of town - which we didnt mind (took a bit longer on day 1 as we misread the map). There is a metro 5 mins walk away but I love walking in cities stopping off for a coffee on many of the corner cafes so did talk the metro at all. Your only 15mins walk from main train station - do take a day trip to Sitges, less than 6 eurp per person return and 30 mins away. The only place we have ever been that families, older people and a large gay community happily mingle - its a great place for a day at the beach.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cNice rooms, slightly inconvenient for public transport\u201d", "Author": "WBarts", "ReviewID": "UR32546290", "Content": "Nice modern rooms.

I did like the fact they had secure underground parking for the guests. On the other hand, my room was very warm... too hot to sleep in really. I had to sleep without any blankets on the bed because it was so hot in the room. The location is decent... it is not close to much of what is interesting to see in Barcelona. I'd prefer a slightly closer metro stop, but 3 blocks away wasn't too bad.
