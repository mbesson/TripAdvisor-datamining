Traveling all day, we decided to grab a bite to eat and the recommended restaurant across the street was open and the food was delicious. Note that Akbiyik street has many good restaurants.

Both were very accomodating, polite and extremely friendly which I can say is true for the entire staff including Tanner and Soner who we met later upon our return visiting some of the local attractions such as Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace which are all within a short walking distance from the hotel. This hotel is in a great location which made it very convenient. It is also very close to the Tram which you can take for 2TL to the Grand Bazaar and other areas (if you don't want to walk). Also recommend taking the Bosphorous Boat tour. It was quite cold during our stay but every day when we returned \"home\" we were offerred a cup of tea/coffee etc... to warm up (also incl). Woman's Day also popped up during our stay where my wife was given a gift and we also received a departing gift. Needless to stay, we had a great experience with this hotel and they definitely get an A+ in service and made our visit to Istanbul a very memorable one. Kudos to the entire staff.

I found the Millennium Suites via reviews on TripAdvisor and took a chance trusting the reviews. They did not steer us wrong. All the glowing comments we read were dead on. The location is ideal. It truly is right by the Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Basilica Cistern -which was one of my favorite sites-- and the Blue Mosque. It's also super convenient to the tramway and all the restaurants that line it. However, Akbiyik Street itself also offers an abundance of excellent restaurants. (I'll list some at the end of this review.) As for the hotel itself, it's both charming and elegant. Actually, I don't think there's enough praise that can be given to Mr. Alper, the manager, Taner and Alper who were at the front desk, Sonar, or Arzu, who takes care of breakfasts and tea time. (And who's homemade pastries in the morning were AMAZING! My husband has missed those treats, let me tell you.) Taner took vacation while we were there so we had the benefit of his friendly knowledge for the first few days. Then Alper, who worked the front desk at night, came in on days for him. I unfortunately don't recall the man's name who took over for Alper at nights, but he was also super helpful and friendly. We had SO many questions, didn't speak a lick of Turkish, but it was okay. They all knew English. (As well as other languages. We heard them speak German and some French too.) The knowledge and courtesy they exhibited was THE best hands down of any I've received in any hotel ever. They connected us with tour agencies, told us places they liked that we might find interesting to see, never steered us wrong with restaurant recommendations, and even lent us umbrellas the one day it rained during our visit. I can't say enough nice things about the staff. The best thing was we had only booked 3 days to start with because we weren't sure what all we were going to do in Turkey. We ended up liking this hotel so much we asked if they had availability for the rest of our stay and they accommodated us. As for the rooms, the decor was elegant and was cleaned meticulously every day. (As is the case with most hotels, I realize, but they seemed to take extra care.) I felt like a princess staying there! The only thing some people might not like is no elevator. I quickly got used to it and enjoyed the extra exercise. If you're looking for good food on the same street as the hotel, I recommend Ocean's 7 (I just wanted a sandwich that night. They had a grilled chopped chicken one that so inexpensive and HUGE! I couldn't eat it all, but it sure was tasty. My husband had sea bass that he devoured.) and Kathisma (we had the baked mushrooms appetizer and a fish platter for 2 that was outstanding!). We had a great Turkish pizza around the corner from the hotel at the Palatium Cafe. Be sure to go in the courtyard and down into the ruins of the Great Palace of Constantiople (Palatium Magnum). Very awesome and romantic, especially at night. About a five or 10 minute walk from the hotel, and near the tramway, is Mozaik. Best calamari I've ever had. Also near there is Khorasani. We ate there twice. The lamb chops were incredible. Juicy and tender. We also had excellent calamari and fish at the Sultanahmet Fish House.

This particular trip was one of the very rare adventures that was purely for pleasure (and on which I was able to bring my wife). We had an absolute blast. If and when I return to Istanbul, I will stay at the Millennium Suites or their sister hotel, Muyan Suites. We stayed in room 402 (top floor). It was incredibly spacious (by American standards, let alone European standards). It was well furnished in an elegant style, clean, well maintained, and in good condition. The television received hundreds of channels (not that you will need to spend a lot of time watching TV in that historic area of Istanbul). The bed was comfortable. The area was surprisingly quiet (given how close to the busy parts of Istanbul the hotel is). The hotel itself is in a great location. It is a 5-10 minute walk from the major sites: Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Archaeological Museums, Islamic Art Museum, etc. There are dozens of restaurants and food stands as well as a fairly high-class bazaar within 1-2 city blocks of the front door. So, for a relatively young couple on a middle-class budget who enjoys foreign travel and were looking for a relatively authentic Turkish hotel experience, the Millennium Suites is perfect. But, the real gem of the hotel is the manager (and I think owner?): Alper Ozturk. His staff is is great as well. There was a slight mixup with our reservation (booked through a third party, I'm sure it was partially their fault). So, for the first two of our four nights, the hotel was overbooked. Alper personally met us when we arrived, explained the situation, and then walked us (10 minutes?) to the recently opened sister hotel called Muyan Suites (please note: the pictures are of our room at the Muyan Suites). He offered to drive but we wanted the walk after the long day of flying. He had booked us in a gigantic suite there. He then proceeded to offer us everything and then some (he offered to book us a cruise up the Bosphorus, a free dinner and dancing show at one of the local restaurants catering to tourists, etc.). We did not actually take him up on those as we had a fairly tight schedule already. But, he ended up arranging a private car to take us to the airport when we made a day trip to Izmir and on our last day when we left Istanbul. And by arranged, I mean he paid for it too. On the third day, when it was time to move back to the Millennium Suites from the Muyan Suites, we simply packed our bags and went about our day. The staff moved the bags for us to the Millennium and they were waiting when we arrived just before dinner. Alper was incredibly nice to us...visibly working hard to make our stay a wonderful one. When we left for the airport our last day at 3:30am, Alper even got up to see us off. He presented my wife with a gift of Turkish soaps. Maybe I have been jaded by the so-so attitudes of most American hotel managers, and maybe I had low expectations because it was my first time in Turkey and so I really had no expectations at all. But, Alper made this stay in Istanbul one I will remember forever.

The location is superb, just a block away from the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque along a street filled with restaurants and shops. There is a wonderful little bazaar just around the corner and Topkapi Palace is five minutes away. The rest of the major sites in the Sutanament area are easily within walking distance. The rooms are very large for a boutique hotel with ours being at least 350 sq ft or more. They were clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. However, if you do get a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153front\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room, of which there are three, bring your ear plugs, because since the street has many restaurants it does get noisy at night until around eleven o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock. This did not bother either me or my wife, but it could some. So if you want quiet ask for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room if available. The breakfast was good considering there are only seven rooms in the hotel. But what makes the Millennium Suites a notch above all the rest is the staff. From Arzu, the breakfast chef, to Taner, the day receptionist/coinsurer, I have not met a friendlier, more accommodating staff anywhere.

I was here on business, but it is a great little hotel for most of the major attractions in Istanbul and I actually selected it because if its location. It is within walking distance of the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and many more places. It is also within an 8-10 minute walk of the tram, (Sultanahmet Station) which is a very good and cheap way to get around Istanbul. It costs only 2 Turkish Lira for a one-way ticket anywhere. It's also a good way to go to the port, if you're taking a cruise. It was so convenient that I didn't even use my rental car the whole time I was here. The hotel is very comfortable and the bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, in a hotel, and I travel a lot! The towels are Turkish towels - large and very soft! The shower is spacious by European standards and the room is larger than most European hotel rooms. The Wi-Fi worked great in the room! The breakfast is free and good - they even make omelets for you! The only drawback is the fact that the hotel has no elevator and only one of the rooms is on the ground floor. The other rooms are located on the other three floors of the hotel, but Taner, or one of the other clerks, will graciously carry your bags to your room. The hotel is situated on one of the most popular streets in the Sultanahmet area and is surrounded by numerous shops, restaurants and other hotels. You won't go hungry and you'll have plenty of places to contribute to the economy of Istanbul! The best thing about this hotel is the people! Alper, the Manager, is the consummate professional and very conscientious about his hotel and his guests. Taner, one of the front desk clerks, has a smile as wide as the Bosphorus and is a very courteous and helpful young man. He has a university degree and is actually a licensed tour guide, so he's a great source for finding out where to go, how to get there and what to do, in Istanbul.

The beds are super comfortable and the bathrooms have terrific showers to blast away the dust from the days sightseeing with high pressure hot water and a nice amenities pack, though no moisturiser which is a small oversight. There is a small restaurant / bar at the front of the hotel with outdoor seating which is perfect for a cold beer or a late lunch. A small but nice breakfast buffet is also served here with omelette made on demand.

The road where the hotel is located, Akbiyik Street, is/was apparently a backpacker's alley. You will see many young people pulling their luggage along the road and there a few places with the label \"hostel\" emblazoned across them. MS, Senatus next door, Byzantiium across the road, are one of several hotels along the stretch. At the end of the road where the hotel is located, there is a taxi-stand, which makes things convenient. Although I'm puzzled why 9 of 10 taxi drivers did not know the street. So on the one hand, this means that there are a lot of shops and facilities catering to tourists. There is a laundry shop down the road opposite the taxi stand. There are a couple of tour companies on and around Akbiyik. Even a Turkish bath. There is a range of restaurants. The Balik\u00c3\u00a7i Sabahattin is right and down the road from the hotel. Up the hill towards Sultanahmet are ATMs that can give you your cash in euros and US dollars. On the other hand, it can get busy till pretty late. So if you do book a hotel along the strip, be sure the window is double-glazed. The windows of Millenium Suites apparently are. Also on the same other hand, do not expect much by way of facilities. MS has no gym (not even an elevator), no pool, no shop, just a restaurant. Reception doubles as the tour booking desk. There are only seven rooms in the entire hotel. In my book, a small hotel does not automatically a boutique hotel make. But it does make for a friendly atmosphere. Breakfast can be tailored to your taste albeit up to a point. It's very pleasant to sit on the patio for breakfast. The room I had was not particularly large although I gather from friends who dropped by that it was large by Istanbul standards. It is not, however, a room to spend an extended period of time at work unless you can work on a square wheeled ottoman (there, wanted to use the word in talking about a place in Istanbul). MS has comfortable slippers. Bathroom amenities are sufficient. The bathroom is a a little tight but comfortable. Water pressure is good. The shower stall's doors are water-tight. A small snag is the lack of a hook on the back of the door. Service is the highlight of the hotel. Staff generally go out of the way to get you what you want? No bread? They walk to a bakery nearby to get it for you. No plums? They borrow from a restaurant. Twice. Booking a tour? No problem. If the price fits, go for it. You may expect friendly service but nothing by way of facilities. And when going by taxi, stop at the Byzantium hotel because the MS signage is small and my car missed the hotel.

I can happily say that this was one of the most pleasant stays I've had at any hotel. First of all, the location is perfect for a first time trek into the beautiful maze that is Istanbul. It is located about a 5 mins walk from the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and the plenty other sites nearby. Akbiyik Cadessi is a very cool street in the centre of Sultanahmet that contains countless restaurants and cafes where you can drink, smoke a water pipe and eat some very excellent food. When I first arrived I was greeted by Alper (there are two Alpers, this was the long haired Alper) who took my bags and had a nice breakfast spread out so it was a good way to start my trip. The owner, Alper (short hair), is a very welcoming and nice guy, I was late for breakfast one morning so he brought me out a Turkish coffee and we ate a couple pizzas cooked by the chef in the hotels Italian restaurant. They were fantastic, the chef used to live in Italy and it shows. I spent almost a year in Italy myself and the pizza brought me right back there! We chatted and had some good conversation as if we'd been friends for a long time. I stayed in room 202, one of two suites on the second floor. The room I had was really great. It's surprisingly large and the bed was very comfortable. There's a flatscreen tv and the wireless internet was very fast. The bathroom is also very good, everything is nice, new and modern. Not to mention the water pressure from the shower is fantastic! Akbiyik Cadessi can be a pretty busy place in the evenings but I couldn't tell from my room, the windows are well sealed and I could barely hear a thing, I slept like a baby. I would definitely recommend this place, Alper and his team really make you feel at home there, and it didn't feel forced whatsoever.

The trappings make you feel you are in a 5-star property, whereas the price is most reasonable. Just could not believe that we got such rooms at such a price. Learned that the hotel is just 10 months old. Its manager is also its part-owner, a young 31 year old man called Alper. He runs the hotel with his heart, and it shows in every part of his dealing. When we reached, he was waiting for us with the bad news that due to some goof-up, they had overbooked for the day, and we would have to spend the first night (out of 4 nights) in a hotel across the street. Just when we were about to scream, he pacified us by saying that this first night's stay would be free, and he was also throwing in a free Bosphorus cruise to make up for the mistake ! Now this was going beyond the call of duty. The hotel across the street looked the best on the street, so we readily accepted. The rooms turned out to be just OK, and we were expecting similar rooms when we were transferred to the Millennium Suites the next morning. But we were blown away when we saw the rooms at Millennium ! The breakfast spread was outstanding. The staff were so courteous and helpful. There is no elevator in the hotel, but the staff gladly carted our luggage up and down. When I inquired about the best place to change currency, Alper advised me to do it at the Grand Bazar. When I mentioned that I may not be going there for 2 days, he offered to lend me a few hundred Turkish Lire, which I could return whenever I had changed my currency...now that kind of an offer I have never received from any hotel in the world. And the day we went on the afternoon Bosphorus cruise, we ordered some sandwiches to be packed, which we took. When we offered to pay for them, it was waived away as a complimentary offering ! This is what I mean when I say that he runs the hotel with his heart. We were two couples, and we felt quite attached to Alper and his team by the time we left. I don't care if this review sounds like an advertisement.....I have posted far too many reviews on this tripadvisor forum to attract any doubts ! I rarely say this about any hotel, but I will say that this is one of the nicest stays I have ever had anywhere. I have stayed at much fancier places, but this place is real value for money.

Secondly, the location of the hotel couldn't have been better. We were close to so many major sites in the old city--the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi, and more. We walked all over the city--even across the bridge into the neighborhood of the Galata Tower and beyond. We never needed or wanted to take public transportation of any sort except for when we cruised the Bosporus. The hotel was so convenient. Third, our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. We felt as if we had a private retreat from the bustle of Istanbul when we wanted to rest. Fourth, the food was plentiful and delicious. At any time of day we could eat a meal, have a cup of coffee, a snack or a drink. The hotel was cozy and the endless attention and service were fabulous.

We personally did not have any problems with outside noise as the bars and restaurants tended to close before our bedtime, but I can imagine if a guest wants to go to sleep at 9pm this could be a problem. However the beds more than made up for any lost sleep as they were heavenly. In fact, I missed the hotel bed on my first night back home.

Overall we were very happy, and we would stay here again. I would not call it \"5-star,\" but it was perfectly nice. Here are some factual observations: 1. When we first checked in, we were given the room on the first floor. I would not recommend this room. It is right off of the restaurant and is basically underground. The view out the window is a cement wall. To their credit, as we were checking in (before we even said anything) they told us we could move to another room the next day when another room opened up. We did this without any problem, and they even moved our bags for us. 2. As a boutique hotel, everything is very personal. Everyone that works there knows when you are coming and going. We usually like the anonymity that you get at a major chain hotel, but it was fine. They were not overbearing, and were actually very friendly. 3. The location is great. 5 minutes to the Blue mosque, 10 minutes to a T1 Tram stop, and the road has lots of restaurants and bars on it. One thing to note, some of the bars are pretty lively (i.e., loud), which didn't bother us (especially since we were creating some of the noise!), but if you are sensitive to this, make sure you get a room that faces the back of the hotel. 4. They advertise the rooms as 35 square meters. I didn't have a tape measure with me, but I don't think the rooms are this big. They are bigger than most European hotel rooms I've stayed in, but probably not 35m2. Overall, not a real problem, because the room was plenty big. 5.

Dealt with the owner/manager Mr Ozturk on email before our stay and he greeted us when we arrived. Throughout our stay though we dealt with the amazing day/evening staff and cannot say enough about them. Furkon & Taner are great guys who switch off running the hotel and were full of great humor, advice and we really enjoyed getting to know them. A new waiter had just started when we arrived, Cem, and he also was just a pleasure to get to know. Arzu(forgive my spelling) set up the breakfast most mornings and made us omelets or cappucinos if we desired and we just loved her as well. When we went to Cappadocia for a few days the hotel was nice enough to hold onto our excess baggage downstairs which made traveling so much easier. I took advantage of the coupon I found on tripadvisor which included one way airport pick up, and a free dinner- as the hotel is still somewhat new they began by opening an all italian menu- the food was very good and Cem treated us very well- I hear though they are looking to expand and include more Turkish fare. The breakfast each morning was very nice and filling with a lot of options. I also appreciated that the staff understood that we were not looking for what the average tourist looks for in a vacation- package tours, dinner 'shows', etc.. and were able to accommodate our specific needs. But I am forgetting to mention the great value of the price- a great deal for the money(especially considering the location, cleanliness, service and the extra airport pick up and meal included) Did a lot of looking and searching for a hotel in Istanbul and though there are certainly fancier and more plush places to choose from I cannot imagine getting a better deal for the money and a better overall experience.

This small hotel makes you feel like you are really welcome - nothing is too difficult for the wonderful staff to help you with. Alper and his entire crew of people were all kind, cheerful, and extremely interesting to talk to. We stayed for only 3 nights, but they made us feel right at home. Regarding the rooms, they were wonderful. We had a queen sized bed on the third floor, and there was plenty of room for all of our luggage in addition to space where we could walk around. The bathroom was great, specifically the shower- big and good pressure. The beds were comfty, there was a nice flat screen TV- basically it looks exactly as it does on the website. The only suggestion I would have would be to add a DVD player to the room - the Sattelite TV was lovely but not many channels were in English. The restaurant downstairs was very nicely decorated, and also served as the reception area - it was a little awkword talking to the hotel staff when there were diners inches away having their meals watching you, but not too big of a deal. In terms of the food, I would say it was acceptable- the individual pizzas are a nice touch, and the prices are quite reasonable. It is one of the only Italian restaurants in the area, which I am sure some tourists appreciate, however they could put a bit more effort into their salads. The food in turkey is great (especially the kebabs!), so I would suggest having most of your meals elsewhere. While the breakfast buffet had a nice selection, some more fresh fruit would be great too. One morning we had breakfast delivered to our room- which was lovely- however the food itself was ice cold. If you are staying there, I would highly suggest eating downstairs - and to the hotel, I would suggest making sure the eggs/potatos/hot pastries etc are warmer. In terms of the location of the hotel - it CANNOT be beat. If it is your first time in Istanbul it is a perfect place to stay, as it is walking distance of all the touristic sites, without being in an area that's too loud and busy. Its on a quiet side street which gets lively at night, as there are many restaurants surrounding it. All in all, I really cannot say enough good things about this place - all the things I picked out were little faults, but I know the hotel staff is capable enough to work on them to make it an even greater experience. Alper and staff- thank you so much for a wonderful stay, and we hope to see you all soon in Istanbul!", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with fantastic service and great location!!\u201d", "Author": "Laura085", "ReviewID": "UR98412374", "Content": "We would like to thank the hotel and the staff for a fantastic stay in Istanbul.

The hotel is in an excellent location (and is just around the corner from the Four Seasons) and the service is amazing. I booked directly with the hotel - taking advantage of their special offers (which included breakfast and pick up at the airport). Hotel: The hotel has just 7 rooms and has been renovated to a very high standard (the rooms really are as shown on the hotel's website). The front desk is to one side of the restaurant and there's always someone available to help. Breakfast is buffet style - there's a great selection and they're also happy to make you an omelette if you'd like. And lunch and dinner (or just drinks) are available during the day. The room is comfortable (as are the beds) - and the shower is excellent. Bathrobes and slippers are also provided and there's a safe in the room. And a flat screen TV with lots of channels for when you're worn out with sightseeing and just need to crash for a bit (they also provide orange cupcakes and other sweets with the tea and coffee in the room, and there's bottled water etc. in the fridge). Service: Absolutely amazing service. I've stayed in many hotels over the years and can honestly say that the service from Alper and all of his team is the best I've ever experienced. I felt like one of the family. Everyone was very helpful and nothing was too much trouble - they happily arranged a half day cruise of the Bosphorus for me so that I got to see more of the Golden Horn and the Maiden's Tower. There was always a hot drink or snack when I came in from the cold; when my iPod was running out of power they charged it up for me. In the evenings, I could sit around drinking beers, reading or just chatting with Alper (the owner, who speaks very good English) and Mehmet (the barman, who speaks very good French and some English) - and learning more about Turkey and her people. I arrived a stranger, and left feeling like one of the family. Location: The hotel is in the old part of the city (Sultanahmet) and it's a five minute walk to the Aya Sofya, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and the Archaeology Museums. There are lots of restaurants in the area and numerous shops and bazaar's (and ATMs). Most of the time I used Turkish Lira though I found that euro's were accepted at a number of the sites as well (and the ATMs could give out both). There's so much to see and do that it's hard to decide - I would definitely recommend all the above, though it was the Archaeology Museums that I returned to for a second day. I wouldn't wanted to have missed the Basilica Cisterns either. Nor the Bosphorus cruise. Basically, 4 days wasn't really long enough and I ended up spending most of my time in the Sultanahmet and Bazaar areas as I didn't want to end up rushing all over the city (and it's a very big city). And this is where the location of the hotel is great - everything is so close to the hotel that it's easy to pop back and rest for a bit, or grab something that you've forgotten. Travelling Solo: Travelling on my own I wasn't sure how safe I would feel in Istanbul. The answer is very safe - having a great hotel as a base really helped, as did the advice of one of Alper's friends (Aslan). I had asked how to make the people who came up to me offering guided tours etc. go away (as \"please go away\" wasn't working great and I didn't want to be rude) and he told me to ignore anyone who approached me when I was out sightseeing (very good advice, and I noticed that the local women also took this approach and just sailed past them like they weren't there). The street where the hotel is located always had people around and, overall, I found the Turkish people that I spoke with very friendly and helpful. Books to read: In addition to the guidebooks, any of Barbara Nadel's (I read Harem ) or Clive and Dirk Cussler's Crescent Dawn. All set in Istanbul and capturing something of the city. Finally, my thanks to Alper Bey and all of his team.

Will definitely stay there the next time I'm in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Single_Black_Female", "ReviewID": "UR90751074", "Content": "I found this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor and I am so happy I choose this place. I traveled to Turkey by myself for a nice relaxing vacation and stayed at this hotel for a total of about 8 days while I was in Istanbul ( I traveled to a few other cities in Turkey during the middle of my two week vacation there.) If you like small boutique hotels (only has 7 rooms) at a great value then this is the place for you. Why I loved this place: 1) The staff: Everyone from the owner to the guys working the front desk and the cook were extremely friendly and kind to me while I was there. In particular, Erhan, who works at the front desk went above and beyond taking me and and two other guests at the hotel site-seeing around Istanbul or shopping on his off time. He didn't ask or request payment for his time. Over the entire stay I found him to be very helpful and fun to talk to. Even the owner was extremely friendly and once he invited me to have lunch with him and the staff one afternoon when I got back early from site-seeing. **two stay fair and balanced, I will say that like all hotels if you ask them their opinion on site-seeing options they will promote tours offered by certain companies for which I am sure they get a commission. But as all hotels I've ever been too do this, this didn't bother me. 2) The rooms: The rooms are surprisingly large, clean and attractive. It appears as if the rooms have been recently renovated. I stayed in two of the rooms while I was there. They both had King size beds that were very comfortable. The rooms have all the basic amenities and they even provide you slippers to wear in your room. The first room I stayed in was on the first floor. The room is located behind the restaurant/lobby area. You pass through two doors to enter the room as a means of soundproofing. I will warn you that if you stay in that room, you definitely have to have the outer door closed or you will hear everything that is being said in the lobby. Also, the room is a little darker than the others because the window faces a wall that I think they stated is one of the old fortress walls that used to protect that part of Istanbul. The second room I stayed in, Rm. 201, is a great room in the back part of the hotel that has a large private terrace outside the room. I didn't really get to enjoy the terrace since it was a little cold to be sitting outside but I can see that it would be very enjoyable in the summer time. Be warned though that by private terrace I mean that it can only be accessed by 201 BUT the terrace faces the back end of apartments in the area so its not like you would go out there in your underwear or anything unless you want to give your neighbors a view....That being said, I have decided that that is the room for me if I go back. **additional disclaimer, when taking a shower in the bathroom it is best to use the shower-head as a handheld device. If you mount it on the wall to use it stationery, you will get water all over the bathroom floor because the shower doesn't have a door, just a piece of glass that only extends just under half-way across the length of the shower. **also, for those traveling in large groups, you should know that the hotel owns a large 3 bed room apartment on the next street over from the hotel which currently rents for 100 Euros a night. The flat was very secure with the top and bottom lock having 3 turns each to lock and there is a safe in each bedroom (the main hotel has safes in the room as well). Each bedroom has a king size bed so it easily sleeps 6 people comfortably. I had to stay in the flat the first night of my trip because the hotel was full. The flat was obviously recently renovated and was very attractive but at the time the kitchen was missing a microwave and there were no waste paper baskets. I pointed this out to the owner and I'm sure that has since been rectified. Lastly, because it is not located on the main property, it seemed that housekeeping has to be reminded to go there to clean (which I guess is okay if the point of a flat is to have more privacy). If I was traveling in a group, the flat would have been a great option. 3) The location: The hotel is located in the Sultanhamet district which is where many of the major culture sites are located such as the Blue Mosque and Haga Sofia. It is about a 5 minute walk to the tram stop and a nice relaxing walk (about 15 minutes) to the Bosphorus river.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Africa", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant hotel, outstanding service!\u201d", "Author": "Joey55", "ReviewID": "UR89740682", "Content": "We stayed at the Millenium Suites for 8 nights in November 2010 after travelling through Europe on a 24 day Trafalgar Tour.

The location of the hotel is extemely central, and two minutes from the blue mosque and hagia sofia which was fantastic, and the hotel also has an in house italian restaurant which has excellent food. The service I recieved at this hotel was second to none in Europe. Both myself and my wife were amazed at the hospitality of ALL the staff. We felt as though we were at home. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at the hotel, even the housekeeping staff always had a smile on their faces and no request made to them was too much to ask. I am generally a very fussy person and I am very critical when I go to hotels, but I cannot find a fault with this hotel, I was very impressed and they had definitely EXCEEDED my expectations, and I will, without ANY hesitation recommend this hotel to anyone going to visit istanbul.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cso clean rooms and phenomenally comfortable large bed in a large well decorated room!!!\u201d", "Author": "Anya_Surovceva", "ReviewID": "UR89711853", "Content": "This beautifull hotel is centrally located in a nice street that is full of nice restaurants,bars ,hotels and nice people from all over the world.This street and of course our hotel were like a meeting point where people come together from all over the world and close to the Blue mosque ,Agia Sophia,Topkapi palaces and less than 10 minutes to the Grand Bazaar by foot.I advise you to use TL as you are in \u00c4\u00b1stanbul and should do exchange in the grand bazaar too.Do make in at the airport and any other place.They pay too less for your money.

We thought our airport transfer had made a mistake with the address. Why were they dropping us off at a restaurant? The check in is at a little counter at the back of the (Italian) restaurant and we felt quite awkward standing there with all our luggage amidst the diners. Given the price we were paying and their claim to be a luxury boutique hotel, that did not give the impression of being either. I must say I felt rather let-down. Nonetheless, the room was spacious, comfortable and well-provided (though our TV had no volume and the guy who was trying to show us how it works didn't make an effort to ensure that it worked before he passed the control back to us and left the room). The shower cubicle also leaked, flooding our bathmat which was rather unpleasant. They did give us a complimentary bottle of wine to welcome us though. Breakfast was a small spread, not fantastic, just sufficient. We thought it was strange that when we went for breakfast our 2nd morning, there were 2 guys there (who turned out to work there) who didn't bother turning the lights on for us in the dining room till they had finished with their smoke outside. That said, the location of the hotel was perfect. Given that we had only 1 day to explore, the proximity to the sights was extremely convenient as we did not have to waste travel time. The street on which the hotel is on is a nice one, filled with eateries and hotels - but is extremely touristy (with prices to match). I think I would have given a better rating if (i) we had been paying a more reasonable rate for the room - I just did not feel it was worth the price, especially with the sort of breakfast offered; and (ii) the website had given a more accurate impression of the sort of hotel it was. I have no complaints about the room itself (apart from the leaky bathroom cubicle which hopefully has since been fixed) - the bed was extremely comfortable and the room spacious, but I was expecting a more luxurious hotel for the price (which was equivalent to a 5-star one we had stayed in in Spain), and based on the impression given by the hotel's website.
