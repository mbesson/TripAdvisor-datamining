It is a basic but clean hotel in an old building with helpful staff, elevator, T.V and A/ C but there is no fridge or microwave and the bathrooms need renovation.The breakfast was very simple but not so bad to start the day. There are no shopping areas around except for a supermarket across the street where you can buy some drinks and food for dinner. There is no need to buy water bottles as all Rome has clean drinkable tap water! The hotel is away from city centre but you can reach it by metro ( in ten minutes ). The service provided is reasonble for the price. It is recommended if you are on budget. Rome is a city that you can enjoy at night especially at the fountain squares. However, beware that the metro service stops early at night ( about 10 pm ) but there is a night bus that works instead and runs in the same route of the metro. You will find the night bus in front of the metro stop. There is a bus stop just in front of the hotel. Ask the hotel staff about its number.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "irvine", "Title": "\u201cpor accomidation\u201d", "Author": "savageirvine", "ReviewID": "UR11204844", "Content": "transfered to this hotel as the one we booked was over booked when we arrived . hotel reception , breakfast room nice .room was in poor repair no shades on wall lights in bedroom, bathroom had wires sicking out of walls not connected to anything. sheets clean blankets old and fraid, no signel for tv . room in badlly needing refurbished . only thing in my opion this hotel had tooffer was good location", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cgood!\u201d", "Author": "G4Ganster", "ReviewID": "UR8210892", "Content": "nice staff.
