Good for families needing space, and/or cooking/washing facilities in the room, or for long-term stays for business on a budget. Very firm comfortable bed, and quiet, allowed for a great night's sleep; this was the highlight of my experience. Service: The staff, mostly philipino like in much of Dubai, were friendly and helpful. Rooms: Large, tiled floors, with kitchenette. The kitchenette and bathroom were both old, tired, worn-down; not of the caliber of most new Dubai business hotels. Location: In Discovery Gardens, the best part is proximity by taxi to the Marina (5-10min; inexpensive, ie 15-25 AED). Also, proximity by foot, 10min, to Ibn Battuta mall, if shopping is a priority. In proximity: A few basic conveniences are next door, in adjacent buildings, including a Subway sandwhich shop, massage parlor, mini-mart, and one or two other basic restaurant/lounges. Ibn Battuta Mall is apparently large, though we couldn't find much of it, and were overall unimpressed.

There are several little shops around to buy the morning paper, milk, water etc. The Metro station is a good 15 minute walk away but brings you everywhere and is really handy. The room itself was spacious. It is only a studio apartment but we had a little kitchen with fridge, cooker and washer/dryer. There were also two beds; one single bed and double bed. But it was a little dirty. Since we were at the beach so often, the build up of sand in the apartment was noticeable and certain areas of the room appeared to never be cleaned, which was a little off-putting. I bought my own cleaning supplies and cleaned the apartment the first day. The staff were a little difficult at times especially when it came to booking 7-seater taxis. We never managed to get one booked by them as they came up with all sorts of excuses. We almost missed two dinners because of this and complaining about it seemed pointless.

As my office was close to Dubai Marina, I said that was not going to happen and they better find me a room. Eventually got the Deluxe Studio I booked but the door was insecure and I could open it using the old credit card trick - something the hotel did not seem to be aware of. Indeed it was useful one evening when I left my card in the car - I just opened the door with a credit card pushed into the gap in the door. Some things were missing from a hotel that essentially is meant to be for those longer stays - frying pan, decent saucepan, cutting board, oven gloves, large bowls, peeler. Had to ask for some and buy others which was not good. After a coupel of nights in the room which has twin beds, I found small brown insects sitting on the headboard and on the sheets. I am not speculating what they are as I am not an entomologist, but when I pointed them out, there was a lot of embarrassment and an immediate room change but to an ordinary studio which was smaller and which had such a poor WiFi signal that I could not connect. Given that the WiFi connection was chargeable, this made the place an unnacceptable location for a business trip and I moved out. Overall, it would be tolerable for a few days on a quick trip to Dubai and if you had a car - but for a longer stay - no! Don't. Fortunately, I found the ZiQoo Apartments next door - same layout and style of building - there are several in this area of Discovery Gardens - but a world of difference.
