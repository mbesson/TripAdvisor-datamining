The bar doubles up as a breakfast room /restaurant and is a beautifully warm and cosy meeting place. Breakfast is generous and more importantly, the selection is broad and all products of 1st class quality. A wide selection of wines and drinks is available in the evening. The real bonus, however, is the staff - rarely have I had the pleasure to deal with such genuinely dedicated and educated staff - nothing is too much trouble for them. I even had the pleasure of meeting the Hotel's Manager and it is obvious that the whole tonality of the service is emanating from her! Definitely a firm favourite for me in Berlin from now on!

There is a number of bars in the vicinity, there is a really nice one just opposite where the prices of the drinks are really reasonable and it stays open into the small hours which is useful to know as the prices of drinks can be quite expensive in Berlin.

Fuggerstrasse itself is a quiet residential street (apart from a small number of bars & restaurants, most sporting rainbow flags) in two halves, off on a diagonal, we found the hotel easier to get back to by walking along Ku'damm & Tauentzienstrasse past Wittenbergplatz into Kleiststrasse - so all one continuous street, you'll never need to remember the names! - then turning right into Eisenacherstrasse, just past the easy-to-spot Conrad Electronics building. the handful of bars & clubs along Fuggerstrasse are far away enough from the hotel you'd really not know they were there, there's no overspill of people and absolutely no noise, but if they are your thing you're in an excellent place to enjoy. Wittenbergplatz is the nearest subway, less than 5 minutes walk away, and the 7 day market there is opposite the very swish KaDeWe department store - this felt like the start of Ku'Damm, it's shops all the way as far as they eye can see and the legs can walk. hotel was small but perfectly formed, rooms compact but very clean & functional, the breakfast buffet was excellent and the bar cosy. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place, or to return, the staff are as friendly & helpful as the area is a joy to walk around.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn Excellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "PaulaTScotland", "ReviewID": "UR6917893", "Content": "I can't add much more to the previous reviews. Being an avid TripAdvisor reader, I check all the relevant reviews in hotels I'm intending to visit. The Scandotel really is a gem. We stayed for 3 nights 1/3-4/3. It's 5 minutes from KaDeWe store, which is a joyous shopping experience. Go to the 6th floor have a glass of bubbly and people watch for a while. The hotel is in the gay sector and there are lot's of gay bars and shops. We are 3 (straight) ladies and felt completely safe and happy to explore the streets at night. As for the hotel itself, it's very clean and comfortable. Non-smoking rooms are available on 3 floors and yes, the breakfasts are good. Every staff member was extremely helpful, we made good use of them asking for dinner reservations and recommendations. There's a very good trad German restaurant about 10 mins walk away by the name of 1885. The food was excellent and very reasonably priced. I would absolutely recommend the hotel as centrally located, clean and well run. I booked through the hotel website and got 2 doubles plus breakfast for 60 Euros per night.

It's a great hotel with great staff - five stars. It's fair to say that my partner and I are both pretty discerning customers, and whilst the Scandotel Castor isn't on the same scale as the Adlon or Radisson, neither are its prices. The hotel and rooms are clean, modern and well-presented, the breakfasts are plentiful and (more importantly) of very high quality. It's worth looking on the hotel's own website to book, as we booked a Christmas Special offer which included breakfasts, evening meal, welcome gifts & drinks and public transport passes all included in the room rate. The staff speak great English and are very helpful, and don't be put off if the hotel offer (under the 'arrangements' section of the hotel's own website) can only be booked direct with the hotel - I booked over the phone in English, and all my instructions (quiet room, twin beds, non-smoking room) were carried out to the letter. The rooms, whilst not being the biggest, have very comfortable beds and are clean. Internet access is free, the hotel location is very central (especially to the marvellous KaDeWe department store, U-Bahn and S-Bahn), and yet the road where the hotel is has little traffic and so is very quiet. Would we stay there again - you bet. A great little hotel for that city break", "Date": "December 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBerlin Delight\u201d", "Author": "Joolsey", "ReviewID": "UR5959752", "Content": "Our three day stay at the Scandotel Castor in Berlin was one of the highlights of a seven week European trip. We had travelled all day by train from Paris then negotiated the new Berlin Haupbahnhof and the Metro system. So we were most impressed by the friendly welcome we received from the staff. The room whilst not huge was more than adequate: the beds soft and comfortable and the bathroom very clean and well supplied with all the necessities. I think the highlight of the stay was the breakfast. An amazing variety of food: cereals, fruit, yoghurt, ham, salami, cheese, a variety of breads etc. etc. Amount and quality outstanding.

The rooms are very well maintained and kept clean daily by a wonderful housekeeping staff. Rooms are medium size and nice for one or two persons, the shower is a little on the small side for someone over 6 foot with long arms but I managed. Rooms have mini-bars (prices are reasonable compared to most), free wireless internet throughout the hotel.

Even the cleaning ladys and janitors were nice and honest: I forgot 50 euros to my bed in a hurry and it was on the table when I got back.
