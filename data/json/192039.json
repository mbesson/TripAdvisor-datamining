The inference was that we should be grateful. It was pouring with rain and we were due at a party in Covent Garden in half an hour so my husband asked if this 'other hotel' was nearby.It took several attempts at re-wording the question before the receptionist decided to summon someone who spoke English. The reinforcement heard our plea to be settled somewhere quickly as we were already cutting it fine and to his credit agreed that we could stay there (phew!) adding sotto voce that they would have to send someone else to the mysterious 'other hotel'. He then asked for our card and went to charge us before we had seen the room. Okay - so it's inexpensive for London (\u00c2\u00a3152 with breakfast) but seriously? pre charging, when they already had our card number and we were obviously a middle aged professional couple - with luggage! :) The room (404) was a cupboard, with the most basic bedding I have ever seen - one thin pillow, threadbare blankets - but it was clean so we dumped our luggage and paid up before departing for the party. Had we not been under such time constraint we would have politely declined and moved on. On our return to the room later, it became apparent that there was not only no tea making facilities but not even a bottle of water. We ended up ordering tea from 'room service' ('Room Service 'in name only- basically only over-priced drinks and Pringles served by some poor beleagured night porter) and we huddled together for warmth under the thin blankets and slept so fitfully that we both saw dawn rise. Breakfast was similarly Fawlty Towers and when on leaving we explained that we had had room service and would like to pay there was yet more confusion and more questions - what had we had? we'd have to wait while the bill for it was found, and eventually..... how WOULD we like to pay the \u00c2\u00a31.70?

The reception claims to be open 24-hours, but on my first night, i got back at 3am. The door was locked, it was cold outside (-4c that night) and the streets pretty quiet. If my friends weren't with me it would be pretty scary because i thought i was locked out. I knocked on the door and even called, but there was no response for about 15 minutes till the night receptionist came out to open the door for me. My friends came in with me because they wanted to see my room. The receptionist called out to me (while we were walking to the elevator... and he was quite rude, if i may add) that my room is a single room, and that guests aren't allowed at this hour. While i understand that this may be hotel policy etc, but i do not appreciate being treated as if i am staying in a hostel with curfew! It would be a completely different situation if he wasn't that rude (and it would've been better if i wasn't out in the cold for 15 minutes).

It went downhill from the onset \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were looking for a hotel for NYE and saw this place. I checked the reviews on here, where many of the recent reviews were negative, which did trigger some alarm bells. However, given we had limited options left, we chose to book and hope for the best \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6err big mistake! The hotel says 3 * on the door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more like a 2* bed and breakfast! But the reason for this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t because the hotel is unclean and functional, but purely down to the lack of professionalism and management policy. We came away feeling the management seemed to be unable to deal with any (simple) problems that arose. THE GOOD - here are the positive points: -Room & Bathroom were clean and functional, and albeit small (even though we had one of the bigger rooms!) -Sheets were clean thankfully!! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (See a previous review) -Breakfast was adequate, although cold!

I agree that the bed is not suitable for anyone over 5\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 8!! -There was no heating control in each room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the room got so hot through the night that I woke up sweating and had to open a window! -The TV channels didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, and hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worked for at least 24 hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the claim was that TV decoders/antennas weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working! The hotel then had the cheek on charging guest for watching a pay movie instead (which curiously was not affected by the antenna problem?!!) even though they were not able to fix the TV until at least 2 days later!! What reflected poor customer service is that the management thought it was ok to charge customers and opposed to giving it complimentary to make up for the broken TV antennas and claimed that it an external source! What a joke!! THE UNBELIEVAEBLE: But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the worst of it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they said the bar was undergoing refurbishment, which is fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so we went and bought some wine to drink in the room, to entertain ourselves, whilst the TV wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. So we bought some wine, and requested some ice, an ice bucket and a corkscrew \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to which we were told the following: (i) The corkscrew \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one!! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c What!! You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a 3* hotel, with a bar, and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a corkscrew \u00e2\u20ac\u201c err no we have one, but we cant find it currently!! (ii) Ice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Oh our ice machine is broken they claimed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6lol\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they probably decided not to fix it, as with no corkscrew, why would people need ice anyway?? (ii)The ice bucket \u00e2\u20ac\u201c err, no reason was ever given, and we just gave up!! Security wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great either, we came back to the hotel in the middle of the night, the front door was open and no-one seemed to be in reception\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.hmmm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6!!

The only public space is the lobby and you can walk across it in about 5 paces. The room I stayed in appeared small when I opened the door but it turned out to be a little bigger once I got inside. The traditional furnishings were used in the room as well - which looked dark but comfortable. Unfortunately the olde-worlde concept also seemed to extend to the laundry - the bedding looked as if it had never been near a washing machine - grubby and stained (yeucch!). I only stayed for one night but I don't think I could have faced going back to sleep in a hotel which, on the face of its looks good, but which in reality is very grubby and dissappointing. One other thing - every time I went into the lobby it seemed to be in use as a meeting room for off-duty taxi drivers.

I have to agree with the reviewer from Boston. My room was on the first floor and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel safe at all. Fortunately, I was there for only one night. The bed was such in a bad condition that I woke up in the morning with terrible back pain. My back was still sore after 3 days. A concrete slab would have been more comfortable. I told the manager to throw this bed in the garbage the next morning but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure it is still there.

Location is brilliant, as only 5min walk to tube which is easy to find and you are just off oxford street so is very central. Found hotel to be friendly, though there english could be abit better, but got buy. Our room was very small, and the bed no good for anyone over 5ft 6in but very clean which we found was main thing, plus for all time you really spend in them we were not to bothered. The bathroom is very big and has good shower. Breakfast room is nice & clean and breakfast was good to. We were abit disappointed that the hotel doesn't have its own bar or do evening meals, as would have been nice just to relax in there one night instead of having go up the street to find places. I do advise that if you book a taxi threw the hotel ensure that you do so early as we had asked them to book one for us on our 2nd nights stay to take us to a restaurant and it was over half hour in arriving meaning we had to call the restaurant and explain we were gonna be there just taxi late, luckily they wee ok about it. We did enjoy our stay at the hotel and would stay there again i think if we ever return to london, because it is in such an excellant spot .", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cheshire Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d192039-Reviews-Cheshire_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$143 - $570*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">110 Great Russell Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">WC1B 3NA</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> (Formerly Country Inn &amp; Suites)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "192039", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cc/d8/ccd83cfa566dcb74902b5ca83af56d8f4large.jpg"}}
