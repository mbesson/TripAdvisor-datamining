{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Just beautiful! The Kori Ubud is a very special place, it has a very traditional feel to it - the location is amazing with views overlooking the rice patties and all the lush greenery that Ubud is renowned for. The pool is nice and clean, there are only a couple of sun beds but we seemed to be the only ones using the pool, in fact - we hardly saw any other guests due to the private layout of all the rooms. We had a luxury villa which was very nice but could have been cleaner. Breakfast is ok, but I highly recommend the traditional Indonesian dinner that was included in our deal, it was fantastic. Unfortunately some of the staff were not friendly, in particular the lady in the day spa and lady in restaurant. But I have to make a special mention to the gentleman that came to our room every night to to turn the bed back and place fresh flowers on the bed, he was such a lovely, friendly person.Ubud town is a 5 min taxi ride or a nice walk and I would suggest eating at all the great restaurants in the town rather than at the hotel. Also, you must try Botannica Day Spa which is 1 minute walk to the left (when walking out on to street) from the Kori Ubud. The lady who runs this place was so beautiful and kind and the treatments/massages are the best I've ever had (and we had them every day in Bali) at a very cheap price.The kori Ubud is a real Bali get away where you can relax and enjoy the spectacular surroundings.", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR174263642", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RikkiT"}, {"Content": "good location, nice staff but room and spa not clean we stayed at Kori Ubud, 3 nights and we had a nice package with one spa treatment, and set diner + airport transferton arrival they had cool towel and water for us on shuttle it was nice after waiting so long time at customs.on arrival check in was fast.we book a luxury room with terrace.there was flower on room and fruits.but : the floor was not cleanthe bathroom and toilet was not clean.the mosquito net was disgustingthe spa was not clean (spider net on massage table hole , very unpleasant) and the masseuse has to go to toilet for long time during massage.during rain, it rains into the roomoverall, the staff was extremly helpful and friendly, especially noply and suria. the breakfast was very very nice and deliver to our terrace every day with a smile.if management read this comment, I recommend they hire a housekeeper.We really enjoy our stay in Ubud, but we will change hotel next time unless I read this hotel is clean.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR669362530", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "rotorua88"}, {"Content": "Loved The Kori Ubud We stayed at the Kori Ubud for 4 nights and overall it was a very nice experienceThe layout of the hotel gives intimacy to each resident.

It was excellent. We had taken the best room they had which included breakfast and taxes. We were treated royally and with kindness to our every wish. Everything was spotless and sheets were changed every day, with towels as often as you needed them. The breakfast was excellent, for each morning of our 12 day stay. The courtesy drivers were enthusiastic and would even stop over to get to an ATM. The manager did take time out to meet with us and have a friendly chat. The pool is outstanding and the upper dining room offered an idyllic view of the rice fields. It is enchanting and restfull to stay at this hotel. Courtesy can be said of each and everyone of the people that you met. The dinner food offered was comparable to a 5 star hotel, given the presentation and quality including the choices. If you look up their site on the internet, you will find that the pictures are not doctored and are genuine as seen. The only negative that I found was the fact that I had to leave such a peaceful environment.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR406558750", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "riclec"}, {"Content": "un bon choix pour sejourner \u813f Ubud   showReview(20956734, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR630932550", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "akimax"}, {"Content": "Un s\u8305jour \u813f oublier au plus vite   showReview(20673028, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR636101645", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "cyberserker"}, {"Content": "\u9359\u5b29\u6c49\u9287\u5c7b\u5153\u9289\u6c47\u5153   showReview(19914943, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR768614271", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "2004\u9a9e\u6dec\u505e\u9289\u7b3a\u5137\u9289\u56e5\u5142...   showReview(19928348, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 27, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR746206575", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d629712-r21560950-Kori_Ubud_Resort-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "629712", "Price": "$145"}}
