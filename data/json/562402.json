The Hotel itself is decent for the room charge and we certainly did not mind the small, windowless room as we were there for just a few hours (and asleep for most of that time). The rooms are all wi-fi enabled. The staff at the reception was helpful and we did not have any complaints with regards to our stay. The hotel does not have a restaurant, but that does not really matter as there are loads of eating options all around the Little India area.

It is definitely a 2 star hotel. The room wasn't extremely clean but it wasn't terribly dirty. The rooms are very small but we didn't need too much room. The beds were not comfy since there seemed to be a layer of plastic between the sheets and the mattress. The kicker in the room is the bathroom. The toilet, the sink, and the shower are all right next to each other. Literally next to each other. You close the bathroom door and that's the way to keep the water out of the room itself. The welcome mat doubles as a bathmat. Also, the water gets cold after about 5 minutes so no long showers allowed. In the top corner of the bathroom, there looked to be mold or mildew growing. Besides the bathroom, my biggest complaint would have to be with the hallway noise. You can hear anybody walking down the hallway and closing any doors. This hotel is in Little India though so if you wanted to be in this location (which we had wanted); this is a place to stay. I wish we had more time to look through the hotels and decide although for the time we spent the night here, the amount we paid was not very much.

I needed a place to stay for the night and given how expensive Singapore hotels are, I made a choice based on the following: - I did not want to stay in a dormitory at a backpacker's place and single rooms at those places are equivalent to those at budget hotels anyways. - I did not want to stay at Geylang. Period. Although if you don't mind the notoriety, you can get cheaper rooms. - And I wanted somewhere close to the East-West line which connects all the way to the airport. So I ended up with Hotel 81 Dickson in Little India (10 minutes walk to the Bugis MRT station). Hotel 81 is a budget hotel chain (perhaps with some notoriety too) but as Little India isn't as infamous as Geylang, and reading about how new this particular hotel is, I thought I'd give it a go. (FYI, Hotel 81 Rochor is just a few steps away). At approximately SGD100 a night for a basic room (no breakfast but with free WiFi), it's not exactly cheap especially when at that price, I can get a 4-star hotel room just across the Causeway in Johor Bahru. But you're hard pressed for options here so I went ahead and made the booking through Agoda. As I checked in only close to midnight (though I did come by early in the morning to store my luggage), and left in the morning the next day... all I did was basically showered and slept. And because I was drop dead tired (having been up since 3am to catch the early morning flight from KL), sleep predominated my first Hotel 81 experience which I can sum up as follows: 1. Basic but functional hotel room that's small but with enough amenities like coffee/tea making facility, hot shower, air-conditioning, and flat-screen TV. 2. Free WiFi is a big plus and given how some full-service hotels charge you exorbitant rates for Internet access, I certainly value the free WiFi service (just ask for an ID and password at the front desk). 3. The total experience depends largely on your neighbours as walls are thin and cement flooring means every sound is amplified. All in all, I've been in worse 3-star hotels so this was pretty alright. Plus the location's great and very accessible. I do wish there are cheaper options in the area but given the prevailing hotel rates at more decent establishments, Hotel 81 Dickson does offer a reasonable deal.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, colorado, USA", "Title": "\u201cFine budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lack of screen name", "ReviewID": "UR119691285", "Content": "It is unfair to compare this hotel with the high end hotels in Singapore.

But there is mirror everywhere, so the room looks larger, and if you are a woman, you will love it here, because there is a lot of mirror...Television is good, there is dvd player in the room, and hair dryer. Toilet - Small, and after take a shower it will be wet everywhere, but it will happen if you choose other budget hotel with higher price as well, so why not take cheaper price and still got the same situation. You got basic amenities like tooth brush, comb and shower cap. Service - is good, you won't find smile on the workers here, but as long as they can assist you very well, then i think that's good enough, the check in time is fast, check out time is very fast as well, i got my room cleaned up everyday and my belongings is safe and sound. Location - kinda far from MRT, need to walking about 15-20 minutes to reach it, but you can take bus from the bus stop, right accross the big street near the hotel, take bus 130, and after 2 stops - you can get to MRT, or if you want go to bugis junction and shop first before take MRT, you can alight after 3 stops, you will stop right in the front of bugis junction and bugis street. If you need drinking water, bread, snack, you can find cheap minimarket just turn left and go straight for a little bit, you will find cheap minimarket, there is fairprice shop near the hotel as well, which is very cheap.

I stayed at this hotel for only 2 days - as a layover in Singapore - towards my trip to Thailand. After my arrival to the hotel, I was given a room on the 5th floor - It has only 5 floor so basically I was on the top-most floor. It was VERY, VERY SMALL room. No window(s), Clean room though with air-condition and flat-screen TV with remote. The toilet commode was attached with standing shower facilities.There was no soap though but instead body lotion from dispenser. and 2 towels.It's not that great of a location - Sim Lim Plaza which houses Electronics gadgetry including Computers and other hardware is locate just around the corner from the hotel - within walking distance. I asked the receptionist lady if it was safe to leave my passport and travellers cheques in the room and she responded by saying that Singapore was a very safe place. So I did and nothing happened to it during my stay even after the housekeeprs cleaned my room. There are lots small Indian restaurants nestled and dotted around the hotel. The hotel surrounding (and even the hotel itself) is very active with people through out the day and even at nights. If you are not into Indian food scene, then there are Chinese restaurants and American fast food joints within walking distance from the hotel. If you decide to take SMRT from Changi Airport, then the nearest SMRT station to the hotel is BUGIS - but beware its a good 20 minutes walk from the station to the hotel. So if you're carrying a backpack you'll be okay but if you've more than 2 pieces of hand luggage than you'll be better off taking a taxi to the hotel. Its $8 (Singapore) ride by taxi and $2.50 by SMRT from airport to hotel. For touring and sighseeing around Singapore you can either book with an agency and there were quite a few aroun the hotel or do it solo with buses, SMRT and taxis.

There is a Hotel 81 in virtually every neighborhood, and we were advised not to stay at any of them. However, when we decided to extend our stay at the last moment, the hotel where we were staying notified us that they were fully booked for the extra days we requested, and we were therefore left with few choices. The hotel is located in the heart of Little India, which is a great part of town to stay in. Upon reaching Hotel 81 Dickson, we were completely put off by the condition of the building. The lobby of the hotel though is quite chic and unexpected. The hotel staff were extremely courteous and helpful with regards to getting to places we needed to visit the following day. The rooms are really small (very common in Singapore). On the surface the room seemed clean, but when we pulled back the very thin comforter, we found hair in the bed! The mattress is made of some awkward rubber material, which makes sleeping almost impossible! Singapore's humid climate means that you stick to the sweaty, rubber mattress. Again, making it impossible to sleep. The bathroom doesn't have a shower / tub, but rather a hose type contraption sticking out of the wall. Showering soaks everything in the bathroom (i.e. toilet, toilet paper, towels, etc.). The room itself is very plain and simple. There is no mini fridge or kettle to make tea with. We were only able to locate one plug in the whole room. We were told that internet is usually available, but that their service was down that particular week. We had to leave fairly early in the morning, so I can't remember if there was breakfast available or not.

The standard room feels like a coffin as there are no windows and it is even smaller than the superior (which was also very small). The superior room has a window, so you feel a little less like a prisoner, but generally the hotel will not let you open the window. I actually got them to open our window which they were reluctant to do, but did in the end. If you ask them for long enough, they might open your window for you. The biggest issue I had with the hotel is something that doesn't seem to be mentioned in any of the other reviews. Regardless of whether you are in a standard or superior room, the hotel controls the A/C in your room! You are not given a remote and you must call the desk to ask them to change the temperature/fan speed etc. This was extremely annoying! Even when you call, the hotel staff are very slow to adjust the temperature or forget completely. Another issue is the terrible bed linen. The sheets for the beds are not big enough to cover the beds, so you end up waking up in the middle of the night on the (plastic covered) mattress. Not nice! The sheets also feel like the cheapest they could have possibly bought. Each day our shower went cold after 2 minutes of use. {A trick is to turn it off, wait 30 seconds to 1 minute and turn it back on.} Very annoying. This hotel is cutting corners in too many places to save money. There's got to be a better option out there Not sure where I'd stay next. Perak Hotel has good reviews but was a little expensive.

However, if you are thinking about staying here for long, these are some things you need to know before making a decision. The room had no window. The shower is not inside a bathtub. The bathroom is small with just the shower head in the wall, and you take a shower in the open bathroom space.

Hotel 81 is known among the locals (at least according to my friends) as a hotel where people bring prostitutes to, but I think this issue is not as prominent in Dickson because it's not in Singapore's red light district - Geylang. Stayed there for total of 6 nights @ SGD89/night, inc. taxes and service charges, which is really cheap for Singapore. Do contact the hotel (Dickson branch) personally because they're pretty responsive and I negotiated the SGD89 rate through emails, which is supposed to be SGD130 or something, due to the high season (Youth Olympic Games). Note: But on normal weekdays, the price for a window-less room should still be SGD89 by default. The check-in was swift and efficient, and I really like the services despite being a 2 stars hotel. I mean, don't expect too much smile and etc but they were all polite and professional. When I was doing my check-in, one of the guest came and couldn't pay the taxi driver who brought him there because he has insufficient singapore dollars. The hotel staff took out his OWN wallet and borrow the guest a couple Sg dollar to settle the taxi bill. Then gave him a printed map, and highlighted a route to the nearest money exchange. I was impressed (a 2 star hotel.. and 5 star service?). The hotel is filled with a strong air freshener spray smell, but do tell the hotel management if you don't want your room to be sprayed every time they make the room. The room itself is pretty big, more than enough, really. The toilet is fine but yea, the it's windows is frosted glass, which I really don't understand why (apart from able to let the light through, i.e. environmental?) and could be VERY awkward between friends or even family members.There's no door for the shower so expect the floor to be rather wet (if that bothers you...). Other than that, no complain - hot shower, toothbrush/soap/shampoo are provided, no shaving kit tho'. I love the TV, has most Singapore channels + HBO + ESPN, didn't really expect that from a 2-star hotel! My only complain is that internet is chargeable at SGD10/night, booooo. Another complain is the location but it's fine if you only go out and come back once a day. It's roughly 15 minutes walk from Bugis MRT, and Sim Lim Square is along the way, about 5-8 minutes walk I think? And the nearest 24/7 shop is about 5 minutes away. There's about 3-4 food centre nearly the hotel but I'm not sure about the quality of the food. =p Oh, do play by their rules, such as the check-out and etc, the management is rather strict, which I'm not sure why... Note: Oh, one more thing, the room is not carpeted, so if you're allergic to carpet and stuff, you'll like this. And the room aren't exactly sound proof, so beware if you're easily awaken by minute amount of noise (it's not from outside tho', it's from the corridor).

If you switch on the shower, the entire bathroom including the toilet would get wet. I am sure many have a problem with that. There was broadband available for Singapore $10 per day.
