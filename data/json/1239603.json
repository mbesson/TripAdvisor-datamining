This hotel serves these purposes very well. Rooms are modern-looking, clean and very comfortable. Staff is friendly and seemed well-trained; free continental breakfast was the standard issue for this sort of hotel and perfectly fine (yogurt, fruit, waffles, scrambled eggs, cereal, etc.). Nearby casual seafood and Cuban restaurants are OK -- the Catch of the Day restaurant across the street has a long happy hour, cheap seafood and is a decent place to burn a few hours. The area, as might be expected for an airport-area neighborhood, is dreary and somewhat run-down. If it wasn't for the tropical plants, the whole area would look like 40 other airport neighborhoods in America. Of course, you can't blame the hotel for any of that.. Rack rates here are higher than you'll see in some mid-range Miami Beach hotels, which is silly, but rooms sometimes can be booked through third parties at a substantial discount (I paid $70 via AAA for a room that was listed on the hotel site at $190). There's a tiny, but cute, whirlpool-style pool on the premises and a nice exercise room. I stayed here for one night before a cruise.

It is just a mile or 2 from the airport. The desk ladies in the morning were very helpful. The bad-----The free shuttle pick up is a good thing, but on our time, a friday at 9pm. was upsetting. I called the hotel upon arrival, and told that driver would be right over (only a mile away). Well it took four more calls, and 35 minutes later, we finally get picked up.

The shower was nice and adjustable and the bathroom was clean and modern. The room overall I would rate at a 5 on a scale of 0-5. It was quiet and restful. The driver had mentioned that the restaurant across the street was a good place to eat. It was called, \"The Catch of the Day\" a combination sports bar and outdoor eating establishment. We had dinner there, outside to enjoy the warm weather and asked the waiter what was their recommendation. He recommended the Jumbalia (sp) and it was an excellent recommendation as it was thoroughly enjoyed by both of us. Our night was restful, quiet and uneventful after dinner and we were downstairs at the appropriate time for the trip to the Port in the morning.

The hotel itself is very nice - front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, rooms and common areas were quite clean and comfortable. Even the business center was nice, with 3 computers and printing services. Several options for lunch/dinner within walking distance, and I felt safe walking around. We called from the airport to request shuttle pickup, and the shuttle arrived within 15 minutes. The included breakfast was your average hotel breakfast - though I've had better options at other Fairfield Inns around the country. The reason I'm giving this hotel a 2-star rating is because of the noise level in the room. Sure, you can hear the planes taking off - this is to be expected. The problem was that there was some kind of club/restaurant nearby that played extremely loud music until at least 2am. We were on the top floor of the hotel - where presumably the street noise would be at its quietest - and it sounded like the band was right in our room. We had to blast the A/C and keep the tv on all night at a medium volume to drown out the bass. This was on a Friday night. I know the hotel can't control what other nearby properties do, but this was ridiculous. Fair warning to those looking to book on a weekend night! The other problem we had was with the shuttle service to the port on the morning of our cruise. We had a shuttle reservation for 12pm, so we took our time getting ready that morning. The shuttle driver called our room at 10:40, begging us to switch to the 11am shuttle! He said that the original 12pm shuttle we were booked on was definitely going to be running late, and that we needed to be on the 11am shuttle to be safe. We felt very rushed and were confused about why this was happening. I'm thinking this was probably a random, one-time thing - but I wanted to report my experience. This hotel was nice, but I won't be staying here again - I book hotels because I want to sleep at them, not listen to club music all night.

The foyer is ideal for meeting people and coffee and iced water always on tap. There is a very good clean and resonably priced Latino Cafe just through the adjacent gas station.

Close to the airport, clean hotel, nice rooms. Close to same location as three other Marriott, but still not a good neighborhood for walking around and exploring.

(The close Residence Inn's shuttle ends at 1am). There are MANY flights into Miami that get in close to midnight, so I am not sure why Fairfield can't have their shuttle go at least until 12:30am or 1am. Our flight got in at 11:45 and as soon as I was off the plane, I called the hotel and talked to Victor and told him we were just off and waiting for luggage. He said that I was cutting it close (as if I had any control over the situation) and that I better hurry up because he was just about to send the shuttle driver on his last run of the night. I told him we were just getting the luggage and we would be as quick as possible. He told me to call when we had our luggage in hand. As we were waiting for our luggage, there was another traveler waiting who was on the phone. She was talking to someone saying she was waiting for her luggage, and that she had to get her luggage by midnight or she would miss her shuttle. She was telling the person on the other end of the line that she called the hotel and a rude guy answered and was not very helpful to her. When she hung up, I asked her if she was going to the Fairfield South and she said she was. I told her I talked to the same rude guy. We got our luggage at 11:55pm and I called and Victor told me the driver had already gone home and I needed to get a taxi. I asked him why would he have the driver go home when I had just called 10 minutes ago, saying I was there? Victor totally knew we were there and would be ready. Victor told me he sent the driver on his last run, and he came back with nobody waiting, and went home already. Hard to believe that in 10 minutes the driver started his run, finished his run and went home in that time frame. I told Victor I wanted to speak to the manager, and he said that he was the manager at the time and that I would have to wait to speak to someone else until the morning. Victor asked me what else he could do to help me, and I said I needed a shuttle. I asked him why he told the driver to go home when he knew I was there? He never answered only saying that I was not ready in time, and the driver had left, and I would have to take a taxi. I called the Residence Inn that was close and they told me they could not pick me up and drop me off at the Fairfield, even though they were close. (It requires about a one block walk, since there is a big wall in between both hotels, and we were not going to walk that with luggage and it being midnight) So we had to take a taxi. When we arrived, Victor acted like nothing happened. I again asked him why he sent the driver home knowing full well, we would be ready in like 5 minutes? Victor only said \"the shuttle ends at midnight. There was nothing I could do.\" Hotel was great, and stay was good, but Victor was rude and not helpful at all. Funny, all the literature in the hotel says they are there to help me in anyway possible. \"We promise\" it says, and continues, \"To make it right. No matter what\" Uh huh, not this time!
