However, the hostal is located on Gran Via, one of the most crowded and busy streets in the entire city of Madrid and the room that we were put in faced the road. Impossible to sleep. The entrance to the building is poorly kept and creepy. The staff member that greeted us was rude, unfriendly and also unhelpful. The towels in the bathroom were rough and almost unusable. The blankets and the pillow in my bed had hair on them and the blanket that they use as a cover was one of the filthiest blankets I've ever seen.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cCheap, clean and central - the three essential \"c\"s.\u201d", "Author": "Travelibrarian", "ReviewID": "UR101582568", "Content": "Staff were really helpful.

As we arrived in this otherwise nice hostal in Madrid centre, a huge noise expected us because of the drilling works in the nearby building. Ok, you don't come to Madrid to sit in a room, and we were promised that the works are not done in the evening and night and are renewed 9 a.m. (which was ok with us, as we planned an early leave). But the saddest thing was that the receptionist lied to us. The works were renewed not 9, but 8 a.m., so we were woken up by a TERRIBLE NOISE and, opening the window, it turned out that the driller was almost BEHIND it! So do not take this hostal, if you like a good sleep, plan to stay in room during daytime or don't like lying people. But otherwise, as I mentioned, both room and bathroom was nice and clean.", "Date": "October 17, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hostal Lauria", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d668302-Reviews-Hostal_Lauria-Madrid.html", "Price": "$47 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Gran Via 50</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28013</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "668302", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e2/2f/e22f7e703ed343a701ef574a2d2074486large.jpg"}}
