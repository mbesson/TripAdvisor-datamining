We stayed for three nights and could have done with more time to see all that Berlin has to offer. The hotel is just outside the ity centre in a very pleasant residential district. I even saw a red squirrel crossing the street outside on my last day. In spite of this relative tranquility there are good local shops and even a currywurst stall close by in case you need a quick snack/fix of this delicious Berlin delicacy. The hotel does not do lunch or evening meals but does do an excellent breakfast buffet. The receptionists recommended the Wirtshaus zum Nussbaum 15 minutes walk or two Metro stops away at the Bundesplatz for traditional German food in the evening. It was so good we ate there on two of our three nights but you need to take a hearty appetite as portions are more than generous. The Metro is two minutes walk from the hotel and links you into the very good public transport system. The Kurfurstendamm with its shops and tour buses is two stops away. There is no airport shuttle but you can getthere on public transport (S and U Bahn) from Schonefeld with a couple of changes and at a cost of a few Euros with a day or Welcome ticket. Certainly puts the rip-off prices charged byt train operators for the London airport \"expresses\" into perspective. Rooms were clean and comfortable and service efficient and pleasant. All in all a very pleasant stay for a reasonable price", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greater London", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable solo stay but nothing special...\u201d", "Author": "mrvanp", "ReviewID": "UR118523702", "Content": "When I've stayed in another city I do typically look for a hotel that is a brand name of 3 star quality or better and is outside of the centre of town (15 minutes by U-Bahn from Zoo Station and maybe about 30 from Potsdamer Platz in this case). Basically this hotel ticks the box for all of the above but I wouldn't say that it is any better than average as an overall experience. I would have no issues with staying here again (if/when I go back to Berlin) but I would also look around first Staff: All of them were very bi-lingual and spoke good English (to the point where they couldn't understand why I bothered to speak German but tolerated the fact that I was keen to improve my own language skills). In fairness I didn't ask anything about the local area so I don't know what they would have been like in that respect. Room: Single Room/Non-Smoking with standard Best Western fittings. It wasn't unclean or obviously worn but you could see it had been while since the last re-fit (the last Best Western I'd stayed in had only been refitted in the last 6 months so the difference was obvious). Key point: if you are offered the quite side of the hotel there is a charge for this (I didn't ask what the charge was when offered it so accept that it was a 50/50 as I'd accepted it and didn't complain) and had a 40 euro addition to my bill when checking out. Other issue is that there are no safes in the rooms but a deposit box option at the front desk which was fine and easy to use (I believe this is to do with German laws on liability so may be consistent elsewhere). Hotel: As above the facilities and fixings were fine and nothing to complain about. My brochure listed it as a 4* but I would say it is probably closer to a 3*+. The lifts weren't exactly fast but were no different to any other hotels I've stayed in. Breakfast: was fine and was the standard Best Western deal, with a few tweaks. Point of note the croissants didn't seem to get replaced (virtually everything else did) and I wasn't exactly late down for Breakfast but only got a couple on the last day (it seems like they were very popular with the Germans). Sleep: I slept no differently to what I do at home so I can only class this as average (I usually tend to sleep in a touch later in hotels). Was unimpressed with what ever woke me up on Tuesday at 7:00am (there was a conference room on my floor but there was the possibility that it was something outside so I can't mark this down). Location: Is outside of the centre of town so it met my requirements but it may not be ideal for others (the U-Bahn is 100 metres from the hotel which will get you to the heart of the city within 30 minutes). Make sure you take the front of the U9 train when heading towards the Rathaus Stiglitz and the back when heading towards Osloer Strasse or otherwise you will come out of the wrong exit that will put you at the wrong end of the block (you want to head towards the ADAC building). Value: was good considering what you got for it, on reflection I wouldn't have taken the quiet room upgrade as I don't think that there would have been much benefit. Stay: September 2011 Time: 4 Nights B&B (excluding sleep I was probably in the Hotel for only 3-4 hours per day) Room: Solo, Non-Smoking on the quiet side of the Hotel", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Island of Anglesey, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood value hotel nice area\u201d", "Author": "lindyloo6", "ReviewID": "UR117770520", "Content": "stayed here for the Christmas markets, the hotel is in Wilmersdorf area which is a nice area with lots of shops to explore.

Do we have to validate train tickets? \"Yes,\" was the quick reply. Of course, no such thing was necessary and I spent wasted minutes looking for the validation machine! The hotel \"maps\" are unreadable, and the ones that were disappeared from the supply cabinet. Breakfasts were OK, but if a tour group happened to be there early in the morning, the pickings were slim indeed. The kitchen staff seemed most relunctant to bring out food replacements.

In Berlin for a few days just get the Berlin Welcome card ticket and hop on any public transport around above or below. Consider buying it before you leave the airport : zones A-C on your ticket will save you buying a ticket to get into the centre of Berlin and might still be valid to get you back if you have enough days on it. Use your ticket (if zone C on it) to get to Potsdam. Our 72 hour Berlin Welcome Card ticket (get your money off voucher booklet with it) with zones ABC cost \u00a325 and worth every cent. The street is a minutes walk from Greek and other restaurants. We tried the nearest (Knossos) twice because it was not dear but was good and welcoming. Hotel breakfast is fine for veggies or carnivires (scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, lots of cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, smoked salmon, cheeses etc). Room was clean and comfortable with tea/coffee, air con and drinks fridge. I would certainly go back. If you are visiting for pleasure choose a good day and go to Potsdam (fantastic). Another day take the morning Insider Berlin(Google it) walking tour (great). Boat trip on the Spray also nice of an evening. If you want some cardiovascular try the Siegesaule tower climb (\u00a32.50) and catch views to Brandenburg Gate etc. Berlin was really something (I was not particularly fussed about going initially) and is my favourite European city so far.
