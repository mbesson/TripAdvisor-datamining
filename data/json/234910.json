The room was very comfortable and we found welcoming goodies each night to satisfy a sweet tooth. Hotel is both old and new at the same time. It has the facade of a many decades old building that may have escaped war damage, but more likely was built to look like it survived. The building next door was built in late 1800's, was bombed in the war and rebuilt after 1945. In any case, the architecture fits and the traditional and modern touches inside the hotel with a courtyard, art and sculpture give this a special feel. We hadn't ordered the breakfast when we ordered our room on line, but should have. If you want the hustle/bustle of a large hotel, look elsewhere. This is an intimate, private hotel with high quality service. It's location was an easy 2 block walk to the Kurfurstendamm (or Ku'damm), only 4 blocks from the Berlin Literary House and its famous Wintergreen Cafe and garden on Fasanenstrausse. In the other direction by 2 blocks is KaDeWe, the fabulous 7+ story department store with high quality and designer goods and the most impressive fresh and prepared foods sales and cafe. The liveliest area on that floor was the oyster bar. We decided that if we lived in Berlin, it would be tempting to eat here often for lunch or dinner. Anything gourmet you'd want to buy would be here fresh, or cooked for consuming there or ready to go home. However, at the Brandenburger Hof you'll want to consider being dazzled one evening in the Michelin 1 star Quadriga Restaurant. The multi-course meal was inventive, insanely flavorful, with impeccable service and will be forever memorable. It was a profound cap to our last day in Berlin. We can't wait to see the movie, \"Goodbye Lenin\" again to reminisce and relive our wonderful fun visit to Berlin.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madeira", "Title": "\u201cElegant and well located\u201d", "Author": "JC64Madeira", "ReviewID": "UR126255922", "Content": "This hotel was picked by my company as I attended a fair.

Our home from home in Berlin.\u201d", "Author": "ACanadianinDublin", "ReviewID": "UR115893395", "Content": "My partner and I decided to travel to Berlin for our joint birthday this year - and both this wonderful city and the delightful Brandenburger Hof made this our best city break ever. The people of Berlin and the Brandenburger Hof are the friendliest and most helpful we have experienced in all our travels throughout Europe. We will most definitely be back. If we could, we'd move in! We arrived on our birthday itself - and although we didn't mention this in our booking, the very friendly Sebastian at the front desk noticed the date in our passports. Later that evening we came back from dinner to find a scrumptious and beautiful dark chocolate mousse cake decorated with fresh berries delivered to our room. We ordered some mint tea to go with it - and another very friendly member of staff served it to us in Bauhaus style tea pots full to bursting with fresh spearment leaves. The hotel is simply beautiful - very intimate and quiet, incredibly relaxing and stylish. The hotel interior is full of Bauhaus and Asian antiques and the interior garden is a work of art in itself. Even though the hotel was full and our room faced the street, we never heard a peep at night and we had the best sleep throughout our stay. There is a private spa, pool and health club within 5 minutes from the hotel - and a free limo service there and back is available at anytime. But there's so much to do and see in Berlin that we didn't have time to try it. And the food! We didn't eat in the Michelin starred Die Quadriga because we had planned a number of cultural activities for the evenings but we sampled the hotel's wonderful breakfast each day. A lovely touch that I have never seen offered by other 5 star hotels is the hotel's relaxed approach to breakfast - and highly civilised in my opinion. Technically the hotel stops serving breakfast at the generous time of 10.30am. However, the staff let us know that we can come down at any time and the full menu would be available. So we were able to sleep in. It's great to not feel the pressure after a late night to rush down for breakfast. I have never seen a more original breakfast menu on any hotel I've stayed in. Delicious, healthy and beautifully presented - with excellent coffee. Another wonderful thing is the opportunity to have high tea in the lounge over looking the garden. Each day there are different cakes and pastries available and later on in the evening, you can order delicious small plates at the Bauhaus-styled bar. It felt very special to be staying there - and we immediately felt at home, so much so that we did not want to leave. We decided to stay in the former West Berlin because we wanted somewhere relaxing and peaceful away from the very busy tourist areas in Mitte. But it was a cinch to get to all the sights - either by walking through the gorgeous Tiergarten or via the UBahn - the nearest station is 3 minutes away at the end of the street on Eislebener Strasse. The UBahn is incredibly efficient, fast and inexpensive - but there are also plenty of taxis that are reasonably priced. It was lovely to have somewhere relaxing to come home to after hectic days and nights and there are lots of interesting sights and a huge amount of shopping within walking distance of the hotel. We're both very surprised that the Brandenburger Hof isn't higher up the list of best hotels in Berlin - for us it's one of the very best in Europe. It must be due to the cost and the fact that it is in the West part of the city. It's true that the hotel is not inexpensive - however we were on a budget and booked the hotel in advance to avail of the generous discount. Also we found that Berlin was far less expensive in general compared to other European cities - both in terms of flights and costs on the ground - so we felt this justified a splurge on the hotel! We both feel it was money very well spent as staying at this hotel made our first trip to Berlin our best travelling experience as a couple so far.

It is a very elegant small hotel located in a quiet side street, not far from the smart end of Kurfurstendamme. The hotel has been beautifully designed and built, with extremely high quality modern fittings and decoration. Meticulous attention to detail. There is a very nice glazed enclosed courtyard, for breakfast and drinks. The reception desk staff were very welcoming, very professional and efficient. Friendly but not intrusive. Perfect for a small high quality hotel. A particular thanks to Mr Sanchez, the extremely helpful concierge. Our double deluxe courtyard room was spacious, extremely comfortable and very quiet. It was also very light due to large floor to ceiling windows. It had a very nice sofa area. We had a very spacious contemporary bathroom, with very high quality fixtures and fittings. Our bed was very comfortable with wonderful high quality linen. Everything was meticulously well maintained and spotlessly clean. For the quality of the public areas, rooms and service, it represents excellent value for money. We paid circa EUR 270 / night for a deluxe double courtyard. Our breakfast was excellent. Best to get included in your rate. For a change, we also had a good but much less refined breakfast at the nearby Literature House. Die Quadriga restaurant is definitely worth trying. We had some very interesting and sophisticated dishes. Some worked very well and had great taste and flavour, whilst others were simply complex - but I think that's the nature of new Nordic cuisine. Essential to try some of their wonderful German wines, or to take their excellent wine glass per dish option. The restaurant service was good, but not as friendly or as efficient as the hotel reception - we seemed to be forgotten about whilst drinking our aperitif in the lounge.

Rooms are located on the upper floors facing a courtyard, part of which has been enclosed as a winter garden. We had a room with sitting area, generous bath outfitted in limestone and marble, but possibly disappointing to Americans accustomed to the huge bathrooms of corporate hotels.

A room had to be made up and we were left standing in the lobby, no offer of a coffee or something stronger while we waited. When the room was ready we were brought up and we had to get into an argument with a cranky but well dressed concierge before the champagne and fruit was provided.

Essentially, you must upgrade to a demi-suite at a significant price increase to garner AC.

They, otherwise, take care of every whim that you may have including a breakfast that is the most elegant that I have ever experienced in any locale.
