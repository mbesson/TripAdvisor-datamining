I have to say that the service I received here was some of the best I've received anywhere - and staying as an employee, you don't usually expect that. The grounds are beautiful, well-kept, and inviting. I'm sad I couldn't stay for more than the one night so I could enjoy the pool. The restaurant had just opened when I arrived, but I did have a drink (which was great!) and spent a few minutes talking with the bartender (Mitch, I think) and the guest service agent (Travis). Travis is one of the best front office employees I've ever met at a hotel and believe he deserves lots of recognition. Every time I saw him, he was going out of his way to help a guest and always had a smile on his face. I'd also like to thank the van driver (Angel, I believe his name was) for his hospitality and conversation with me when he took me to the Lightrail station before the baseball game. You have really great employees here. The room was beautiful. I was upgraded to a suite (sooo appreciated!). The towels were huge and fluffy. The room was clean and smelled great. They use Bath & Body Works amenities in the bathrooms. The bed, as usual for Hilton Garden Inns, was fantastic. I had a stove top in my room, too, which I didn't use, but was nice to see. I'll be back many more times this year, hopefully, when I come to Phoenix. I had such a great time!

He cut the filler hose to the tank so we could not refill it. The manager was nice to lend us a DUCT tape so my husband can tape the filler hose together so we can go home to California. My husband made it work but the experience dampened our stay there for 3 nights. On top of that , we had a terrible experience during our 1st night. We were assigned to a room near the elevator. All night long, we could hear the elevator going up and down and we slept poorly. The bed was good but the sound was bothering us. I don't know why anyone was assigned to that room at all. We should have asked for them to move us in the middle of the night but we didn't want to repack our stuff in the middle of the night. They moved us to a room in the corner (end of the hotel). The room was just ok but the bed was terrible. In the beginning of the night it was firm but by morning, my side sank down like it had a leak or something. We parked our car at this end and I think it was a mistake. I wanted to give 1 star but the service from front desk was great in helping us to recover our bad experience. Also, the room was clean and nice (despite the bed). It is not the hotel's fault that a thief stole our gasoline so I gave a 2 stars. But overall experience was so bad that I can't give more stars. The hotel should provide more security and install a security camera in the premises. The gasoline that was stolen costs us $60 but to fix the hose, it costs us $160.

We arrived in Phoenix two days earlier than expected, having to pick up our daughters at the airport we decided to stay at the airport HGI. The room was up to our expectations and we decided to go to the Happy Hour for appetizers. The food was very good. The service was very poor. We waited for a server to take our order. We asked what were the appetizers available for Happy Hour and she showed us the appetizers on the full menu rather than the bar menu which had a wider variety. We had ordered an entree to take to the room. When we finished an appetizer we waited for 20 minutes for her to return. We asked for a box and our bill. She did not come around for another 20 minutes. We asked the other servers to assist us and all they said was they would tell our server we need assistance. When she brought the bill she did not have our entree and had not turned in the ticket to the kitchen. We cancelled the entree and found we were charged full price for the half price appetizer we did have. It took another 15 minutes to get a correct bill. Tonight, we thought we would give it a second try as anyone can have an off day. Tonight we were served in a reasonable time and the server checked on us once. We had to ask for a box and for a bill. The bill again did not reflect the half off prices. Tonight it took more than 10 minutes to correct the error. If we were in a hurry we would have been very upset not just aggravated.
