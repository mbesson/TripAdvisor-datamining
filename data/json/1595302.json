The main thing that really impressed me was how well laid out the room was. Although somewhat small, the room never felt that way as every inch was well though out and designed efficiently. The room was tastefully designed with modern furnishings and had all the requisites for a business traveler: free wi-fi, plenty of outlets for charging electronics, ample desk. One really nice touch was the espresso machine in the lobby's \"great room.\" If I had a longer stay I could see lounging in the great room as there was a lovely fireplace and lots of comfortable chairs. Instead after I checked in and got situated, I headed to the lobby lounge (in my socks!) and helped myself to a cappuccino. It was definitely a little treat that made my stay a little nicer. One other thing I thought was a good idea was the self check in/out. You just go up to a kiosk and check in and check out. Saves time waiting for a desk clerk especially for business travelers who invariably are either tired from a long trip or in a rush to head out of town or to a meeting (as I was the next morning when I checked out). The one small negative is the construction across the street on the new World Trade Center memorial. The construction noise started quite early which was not too bad for me since I had to get up early for my meeting but I can see how it would be terrible if one wanted to sleep in. The hotel is definitely geared to business travelers so I wouldn't necessarily stay here if I was in NY for fun but if I had meetings in the area, I'd definitely return to this hotel.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood deal for 1-2 travelers, not for families\u201d", "Author": "Tabu812", "ReviewID": "UR126151631", "Content": "Got this hotel on a deal via Travelocity. Was slightly hesitant based on some of the poor reviews. Overall, I am satisfied with my stay at this hotel but if I had paid more, I would have been less satisfied. Below is an overview: Location (all Pros) * Directly overlooks Freedom Tower, view from the restaurant is breathtakingly eerie * Using Airtrain, LIRR, and Line 1 to downtown on Subway, you can get here from JFK with under $20 in roughly one hour - perhaps less if you don't get as baffled by Penn Station, like I do - most people don't. Getting off at Rector St., you only have to walk about 3 small blocks to the hotel. * Neighborhood is quiet. Only drawback is most things close early since this is financial district. However, there is a small Italian restaurant/bar within walking distance with a low priced dinner menu - since not too many customers in the evening. Cleanliness * Pro: The hotel is clean and you can tell it's quite new. The rooms have that Ikea showroom feel and smell. * Con: The shower curtain had a few tiny hairs in it. Not pleasant, but this is common to anywhere. The room felt clean enough to take your shoes off in, but this was the only complaint I had about the cleanliness. Comfort * Pro: Had a desk and comfortable armchair for guests. Worth the price. IPod dock on nightstand - nice touch. * Con: Booked a room with a queen bed. Was traveling with a friend. It was definitely not a queen, slightly larger than a twin - luckily, we're good friends and both quite small. Service: Many of the reviewers warned about the service in this hotel. It seems to be hit or miss. 1) There are two entrances and seemingly not enough staff, which may have been part of the issue 2) Staff not always very helpful or clear: When I called to ask for an iron, the front desk gave a room number to retrieve the items from. After several attempts to enter the room number I was given, a staff member happened to walk by. I asked about an iron. The staff member reached over and opened A CLOSET directly across from the room I was trying to open. The closet was full of supplies, including irons and ironing boards. The incident was funny, but had someone been in the room I was trying to open, this could have been quite embarrassing. 3) Check-in: However, my friend checked us in before I arrived and stated that the man at the front desk was really rude to her. When I arrived, the person at the front was a woman who was very polite. Again, it seems to be hit or miss. 4) Restaurant: Don't bother. Went up for a few cocktails with friends later in the evening. The view was gorgeous, but there seemed to be one waiter on hand and he was wildly incompetent. He kept forgetting that we were there. Not rude, just seemed annoyingly inept. Overall review: * Don't pay over $150/night to stay here or you will be disappointed * Do stay here if it is only a few nights and you are traveling solo or only with one friend * Good for the bargain price, would stay here again solo", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westport, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cVery greedy hotel, watch out!\u201d", "Author": "eric d", "ReviewID": "UR126143892", "Content": "Small, but functional rooms.

For the rest, we were able to take the subway which is VERY close by & to head uptown only takes about 20 minutes. Our flight brought us into town very very early (7a.m.) -- they allowed us to check into the room @ 7a.m. for just a $35 extra fee - which was nice, we dropped the luggage off, used the restroom, washed up & had the rest of the day to spend in the city. The staff was very very nice - helpful with directions - and with our young daughter. When they noticed we had a small child they suggested a room away from the memorial side as it can get loud w/ the construction - how nice!

They are usually cramped rooms with very few amenities in the hotel, earning them the unofficial nickname \"Club Closet\". This one breaks the mold. The rooms are actually fairly large by NYC standards. The hotel is pretty new, so that's probably a big part of why it seems so nice. The lobby has a great lounge area, with cappuccino machine, newspapers, magazines, TV, internet stations and ample seating. On the roof they have an open and airy restaurant, which has a bar for the evening and breakfast buffet in the morning. There is also a rooftop patio to lounge in the warmer months, or just get a good view of the surrounding area. If you are planning to visit the 9/11 memorial, you can get much closer than this. In fact you can see the hotel in the pictures on the memorial website (http://www.911memorial.org/explore-memorial, it's the white building in the back left of the photo). Our room faced the memorial, which is lit up at night. I do strongly suggest visiting it, the tickets are free. If you are driving in, I suggest using the parking lot they are affiliated with, which is on Albany St a block away. If you \"self park\" it's $37/day, compared to the $50 or so at other garages. They will also bill the charge directly to your room. You can find the address for the garage on the directions page of the Club Quarters website. When you get there, it looks closed, but if you tell the guard you are staying at Club Quarters he will remove the various security measures and let you in. I probably shouldn't let out the secret, but unlike most NYC hotels, the room rate at the Club Quarters actually DROPS on the weekend. They get most of their business during the week from business travelers, and so the weekend is pretty dead. As part of their business model though your company needs to be a member in order to make a reservation here. But if you know someone whose company is a member, they can make a reservation for you.

The services were great, they had a lounge area downstairs with free coffee and tea, there was free water and ice for all guests which we used regularly, and also the restaurant which had fantastic views over ground zero and the new twin towers, meant we didnt have to queue for ages to see the site! The staff were friendly, similar to what you would expect in other american bars/restaurants, so slightly different to english culture but friendly none the less.

I really love the idea of having purified water (free of charge) available 24hours. Also great to see a microwave in the room in a New York hotel (I've stayed in a couple of NY hotel and I haven't seen this facility in the room) in a city hotel only in Florida hotel rooms. I found the staff friendly, I wasn't impressed of a 2min working microwave that I reported before going out for the evening just after landing, just to find out that on my return that the maintence man (took a look at it in my absence) but didn't swap it out for a working appliance. So the next day I had to call Housekeeping again to actually have the microwave replaced, that should have been on the 1st call that I made to them, me thinks. Anyway. Liked this hotel alot and really enjoyed the breathtaking views in the restaurant on the 20th floor. The breakfast was waaay to expensive and really not worth it, its so basic and over priced I can't remember the price but it was between $15-20 person. Very clean hotel, loved the ipod alarm clock- felt like home from home to me. Very close to tubestations, fast foods places and tube stations/subways Was pleased when I stepped in the room and flying from London and Very happy to be in New York for New Years Eve- it was GREAT! On a down side- Resturant across the road- Blue Planet Grill- Nice food, again expensive and terrible that they give you a 'recommended gratuity amount' approx i.e. $19.80, $23.80, etc. You tell them what you are prepared to pay in terms of gratuity i.e. IF I HAD TO PAY- I will pay the lowest, the Server blanks what I tell him and he gives me a sob story that the gratuity that he PICKED for himself goes to his him.

The windows are tiny and in my room, only looked out into an air shaft. My business colleague staying in another room complained of the rooms feeling claustrophobic. I really like some of the things they are doing. They are trying to conserve water, which is a good thing in NYC. They have dual-flush toilets so you can select the flush that is most appropriate for the need. They have pure water dispensers in the hallways and plastic bottles that you can refill. Their top-floor restuarant offers a great view. The buffet breakfast there is \"only\" $16 and includes scrambled eggs, toast, bacon/sauage, fruit, juice, coffee, cereal etc. Better deal than the $24 for breakfast at the nearby Millennium. A major inconvenience was that one elevator was not working. It took over 7 minutes to get from the restaurant down to the lobby. What will cause me to avoid this hotel is the attitude of the front desk staff. They seem to have a real chip on their shoulder. No customer service skills.

After the second sleepless night, we spoke again to the front desk staff and they very rudely told us that 'once they start a project they don't like to stop until the job is done' and without even checking their computer, they said there was no other room that they could move us to. They then said that they could give us ear plugs if we needed them, but it was too late because we had already purchased our own! A staff member then proceeded to inform us while she was using her cellphone that 'they don't work on Sundays, so we can sleep in then' ... that pretty much sums up the (very poor) customer service that we received. This hotel is directly beside the WTC grounds, which we were aware of, however we were not aware that the construction would run all through the night.

The location, while not in the thick of tourist activities, was convenient. Several subway lines are within 2-5 minutes walk. Despite what I'd read prior to my arrival, the area is not deserted at night. There definitely aren't crowds of people after dark, but there are several big hotels nearby, and enough bars and pizza/fast food places around that there were always cabs driving around and people walking about, even at 1:00 in the morning. The front desk staff were very helpful and professional. Housekeeping was similarly well-maintained, although the bathroom in my room did smell mildewy. I suspect this has more to do with the lack of ventilation and cheap shower curtain in the bathroom than lack of housekeeping. People who complained that their sheets weren't being changed must not have read the laminated card that was placed on the bed on arrival. If you want fresh sheets, you must put the card on your bed, otherwise they will simply make your bed with the existing sheets. This is clearly explained and certainly not unique to this hotel. Same thing applies for towels (leave them on the floor if you want fresh towels). We originally booked a standard room with queen bed, but upgraded to a much larger room with mini-fridge and microwave for an extra $20/night, and it was surprisingly roomy for Manhattan. The WTC construction really is 24/7, but we requested a room on a higher floor, on the opposite side away from the construction, and we couldn't hear it at all. We DID hear the elevators going all night long. Our room must have shared a wall with the elevator shaft and the walls are thin. I was also disappointed that there wasn't a safe in the room to lock up valuables. My only true complaint about the hotel, however, is with the restaurant. We went there once, for breakfast, and did not have a good experience. The food was fine, but I was not impressed with the service. The hostess did not crack a smile even once. She looked like she truly loathed her job. When we arrived, she offered us the worst table in the place. When I asked for a different table (one that wasn't in the middle of a nearly empty room, in the path of the main aisle used by the servers), she robotically brought us us to a better table and said, \"Here,\" before walking away. Thirty seconds later, a server came and told us not to sit at that table because we were only two people, and told us to \"sit there\", while pointing to a smaller table. We had the buffet, which was fine, however I was irritated to find that they tacked an automatic 18% gratuity on the bill, which I do not think is warranted for a buffet, ESPECIALLY since I had to flag someone down to get coffee and to get a menu, and since the bill was dropped on my table before we'd even finished our first plate. I took a small portion of eggs, not wanting to heap my plate with food and look like a slob, and intended to go back for some fruit, but I was so irritated when our \"server\" dropped the bill on the table when I was still eating (without asking if I wanted anything more), that I had to leave. The automatic gratuity was just icing on the cake. Aside from the restaurant, I'd return to this hotel in a heartbeat.

All of the \"hot tourist spots\" in NYC were easily accessible by subway from the hotel (or short cab rides), yet it was not in a bustling and crowded area, which made it a nice, quiet place to come back to and relax after a day of sightseeing. There were many restaurants and bars close by to choose from and they were all merely blocks away. There was also plenty of sightseeing to do in the Financial District area of the hotel (Wall Street, 9/11 site, St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc.), although the area around the hotel is a little dead on the weekends. Considering that it was a 4 star hotel, the rate we paid was such a steal. We didn't want to pay a lot of money to stay right in Times Square, and the cheap hotels were too far out in areas like Queens, Bronx, or Long Island, so this was a bargain considering how nice it was and the area. The room was very spacious. There was plenty of room for 3 of us girls to move about, with all our bags, suitcases, clothes strewn about, in addition to the 3 mirrors and overabundance of outlets, which was nice when we all got ready at the same time. We had a queen size bed and a pullout couch, both of which were very comfortable. The filtered water bottle machines on each floor, free coffee/tea/hot chocolate, and internet room/lounge were great amenities that the hotel provided. Also, I recommend having a meal at the restaurant or drinks at the terrace, both on the top floor, as the view was beautiful to look at while enjoying food and drinks. I really have no complaints about this hotel, except that it was tricky to initially find, but if you ask any businessman or police officer, they can direct you right to the hotel. All the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful (except for one man at the desk who was a little rude). While many people complain that it is literally overlooking the World Trade Center construction, the noise was never a problem, as we were not in the room for a majority of the day.

Elevators are right beside front desk and to the left of the elevators is a business centre. Keycard swipe is required for the elevator to function which is expected and appreciated from a security standpoint.

The neatest thing was the monitor cable which allows you to watch what's on your laptop on the screen. Only one free plug though beside the coffee maker. There is a sofa chair and lamp beside the bigger-than-King-size bed which turns out to be two twins put together, plus a huge wooden headboard with two night lights on each side. A large framed photo presents itself opposite to the bed, and to the right is the window. Room 427 doesn't have much of a view, but others do have a great view of WTC from what I understand. Noise from the construction outside was not an issue. I was beside the laundry room and could not hear it. You can hear the sound of people rolling away the laundry so if you're a light sleeper that might be a problem. But not for me. Can't comment on the fitness facilities but they are available and on the 6th floor. There is a dining room on the 20th floor as well. Didn't eat at the restaurant so can't comment on that either. If I was here for business again I would definitely stay here. If I was here as a tourist and ran out of options in cooler areas of the city, i would not. However, given the location, Chinatown and the East Village are quite close and if you wanted to, the Statue of Liberty is also near by.

We had a very large room for NY, with kitchenette and table, bed area, hall with bathroom and a sitting room overlooking the ground zero site (not the happiest of views, but historic). Kind of an awkward layout but comfortable. The room was clean and quiet and, unlike at the midtown location, there were people to help when we needed washcoths, Splenda, whatever. Decor is all light woods and translucent panels, easy on the eyes. The hotel also has a restaurant on the roof which overlooks the Hudson and downtown (and as they out it \"the rising Freedom Tower\") where they had a decent breakfast buffet on weekends (a la carte during the week). The restaurant has an indoor area, nicely elegant without being uber-chic, and an \"outdoor\" enclosed area. It was enjoyable. For the money paid this was a very good hotel experience.

I got a corner room on the 15th floor which had a flat screen tv at the foot of the bed with cables to hook up a laptop or other video source via component cables. There was another tv at the end of the small workspace which could be viewed from the table or from the easy chair which could convert to single bed. There was also the added benefit of both a microwave and small fridge. There are filtered water machines in the halls with water bottles that you can fill up for your day of sightseeing. The fitness room was adequate with 3 treadmilIs, free weights, an adjustable bench, eliptical and 2 other machines? The first floor has a number of workstations which you can use to check email, surf the web, and they even have a color printer you can print to. I was a little disappointed that they hit me with a $35 early check in fee, but oh well.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Hotel after bad 1st experience\u201d", "Author": "aussietraveller1960", "ReviewID": "UR60881805", "Content": "On checking in found that despite booking studio room was provided with a standard room. As hotel was full and we were returning we were offerred an upgrade on our return which was honoured but was not a great 1st experience. Being relatively new the rooms are in excellent condition. The space in the studio was awesome. As currently no restaurant a free breakfast is provided. This has great variety. Hotel has good access to the subway. Being in Lower Manhattan there is not a large range of dining options.

I arrived at 12pm and left my bags as check in was not until 3pm. When I came back to check in after dinner, I pleasantly found my bags had already been taken up to my room. I booked a standard room and was given a superior corner room on the 17th floor with amazing views of the Brooklyn Bridge, downtown Manhattan and the river from 3 corners. It really was breathtaking. The quality of furnishings was very high with thick cotton bedsheets, thick blackout curtains and nice towels. There is also unlimited bottled water in the hallway. There was no noise at all from outside, I had a view of the World Trade Center and could not hear the construction work going on. Service was excellent. The concierge were very happy to book tickets for you for theatre, Empire State etc and they charge a $2.50 admin fee or you can book yourself on the free computers they provide in reception. The printers really came in handy as I was able to print out maps for my walk abouts. The only downside I found was breakfast and the reason why I have marked it down by 1 star. It really was chaotic. Breakfast is served in a side room near reception and there are no tables so you have to eat from polystyrene plates off your lap. There is also not a lot of choice. They had cereal, muffins and bagels. The rest of the hotel made up for the poor breakfast. Sunday - Thursday they have beers, soft drinks, cheese & salami 5-7pm which was nice to come back for a small rest before dinner. Overall, this hotel was fantastic and I would happily stay at any Club Quarters again.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Club Quarters World Trade Center", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1595302-Reviews-Club_Quarters_World_Trade_Center-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$208 - $327*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">140 Washington Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">NY 10006</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1595302", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/98/7f/987ffdeaab7b4a87493af03bbf189bd84large.jpg"}}
