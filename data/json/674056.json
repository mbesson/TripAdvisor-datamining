The bed and pillows were very comfortable. My only issue was, you have to walk through the bedroom to get to the bathroom. If you have someone staying on the pullout couch, which we did, it can be an issue. That seems to be the arrangement in many suite hotels, which I don't tlike.

Last year I couldn't have been happier with our stay, this year I could have been a LOT happier. I will start with THE GOOD. To start, we got a great deal. We stayed as a group last year and were able to negotiate a good rate for this year based on that. The room was nice and clean. That is very important to me. In fact, we loved the room. We had a double queen suite with a pull out couch in the living room. Plenty of room for the 4 of us that stayed there. Some in our group had as many as 6 in their rooms and they still felt comfortable. The kitchen with full fridge was a plus. It was perfect for leftovers from the restaurants we visited on our off time. It was nice to have cupboards filled with dishes and we were very happy to find wine glasses and even a wine opener. If you have ever had to spend a full day at the convention center with teenagers and non stop cheerleading, you know how much appreciated a nice glass of wine is when you get back to your hotel! Breakfast was good, too. A nice selection. On Saturday we had to be at the competition so early that we missed breakfast but on Sunday the manager was very helpful and arranged to serve it an hour earlier than normal so we could eat before we left for the day. It was great to fill up before we hit the road back home on Monday, too. The shuttle was a nice convience but it wasn't always running. However, the front desk was always quick to get a cab for us when needed. It was never more than 5 to7 bucks for a trip to any downtown destination. Now, THE BAD To start, we had a group with us. 6 rooms total. We understood we probably wouldn't all be right next door to each other but we requested we be close. They said \"they'd try\" but we were spread out all over that hotel. Some on 2nd floor. Some on 3rd. Some on 6th. Based on what I saw that weekend in the breakfast room, lobby, elevators, and parking lot they were not fully booked. I think they could have \"tried\" a little harder to get us at least on the same floor as each other. Second, no maid service on weekends. No new towels, no trash emptied, no clean up, no beds made. If you wanted weekend maid service you had to call before 5 to arrange it, and you'd be charged. With 4 women in one room there was no way we could go three nights with the original set of towels. So, on Saturday (night 2) I called the front desk to ask for more towels and a trash bag since ours was completely overflowing and was barked at \"you have to come down here for that!\" So, down I went. I had to practically beg for enough towels for us to shower with, they did not want to give them up. And I was told there simply was no more trash bags to give. None. I had two more nights left with trash overflowing in the kitchen and bathroom and they would not give us a trash bag! Each one of my friends (6 rooms worth) all had the exact same problems. One was given hand towels to shower with, one was given dirty towels, and yet another was just told \"sorry, no more towels\". Nobody ever got a trash bag. Not one over the whole weekend. By Monday when we left we had trash piled all over the place. We used grocery bags and take out bags that we had with us but still, it was bad. And we had to deal with it all weekend since there was no maid to come through and pick it up. Awful. Just awful. One last thing. While we all got a great rate, one person in our group was charged a LOT more than the rest of us and they had no explaination for it. They ended up taking $75 off her bill but that was still nowhere near the deal the rest of us got. When she complained and explained she was part of our group (booked together and everything) the front desk people had a \"too bad so sad\" attitude. I was sadly disappointed in the Staybridge this trip. And that's unfortunate because last year was such a good experience. With the Super Bowl in Indy this year and Lucas Oil Stadium being just steps away you'd think they'd be on their A game but they really fell flat. I like the Staybridge in general but the lack of towels and trash build up did me in. I'm not sure I'd stay there again. I think if we go back to Jamfest next year I will try somewhere else.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNot as nice as some other Staybridge I've been in\u201d", "Author": "weyes", "ReviewID": "UR122713466", "Content": "I was surprised we had to pay for parking on a night when it seemed completely dead downtown in December.

Upon arriving to the hotel, I requested a later checkout and was pleasantly surprised that the front desk was willing to accommodate even though I requested this before arriving and was denied twice. Additionally, I was given an upgrade. The room was great, wonderful amenities and clean. The hotel is also super close to Lucas stadium.

The good - staying here also meant we could walk to Meridian for food and fun at night. Yes, it was a little bit of walk, but we were not bothered by walking. The okay - this hotel does not have an ice machine for hotel guests to access without going through the front desk. The ice machine in our room didn't produce more than 2 batches of ice each day. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite, great for 4 adults to sleep but tight for hanging out in the living area as a group (plus the 2 others staying down the hall). Breakfast was okay, not great. The front desk staff was pretty helpful in answering questions for us. Parking lot behind the hotel was a little tight. The night of the game, we knew that would be an issue and planned for being back from IMS early. You can't deny how awesome it is to have the view of Lucas Oil Stadium outside your room every day. There was no room service on the weekend, which was fine since we were aware of this. I will say that the front desk didn't tell us this, I knew this from reading reviews and reading the sign in the bathroom, however it wasn't a prominent sign and our other party staying here didn't realize that.

I can't imagine anyone bringing enough food with them to cook while on vacation or on a business trip. The couch and bed were perpendicular to the TV so it was not watchable from either.

Every year I meet my family in this area for a three day weekend and the race. This year I came across this hotel on the internet. The pictures were amazing. The full kitchen really looked great. The price was a little high for a two bedroom suite. But I thought it might be a nice treat. I called to get more details. I was sure to have a long talk with the reservation clerk as I need to ensure we were getting one room with two double or queen beds as I have a 71 year old father and a handycapped sister. They require their own beds. I also travel with my husband and two young children so they could stay on the pull out if needed the other room really didn't matter. I was very excited after talking to the clerk that they had a two bedroom suite one room with two queen beds and another with a king as well as a full kitchen. We arrived three hours early and obviously the rooms were not available. When the room was ready we were very excited to see how it looked. What we found was a a two bedroom suite with two king beds and a kitchen that really should not be called a kitchen. It did have a small fridge and mini stove top but looked nothing like the picture. It actually looked other places we had stayed that called it a mini kitchen area. Basically a one bedroom suite with a door left open to another room. I called downstairs as there was no way father and daughter could sleep together and at this point we didn't have enough beds. I was told that I must have made the reservations wrong as it was coded two kings. I explained I had a detailed conversation with the clerk and was told that is not what we have here. So first I was insulted and made to look like I lied. I explained we cannot take this room we didn't have enough beds. After some back and forth I was told we will give you a room across the hall as that is all we have and will take 50.00 off the room for your trouble. Although I was still a unhappy with the situation and being separated from my 71 year old father he felt he would be fine alone and we were getting a discount price which would save him money so we decided to go ahead and agree. The only other complaint I have is the \"movie room\" this is really just a TV and you have to bring your own movie to watch. I was under the impression from the site that they played disney movies. When I got home I found a 868.00 room charge and a 197.00 room charge. I would like to know who would ever consider paying that much for three nights! Anyway, I called to complain and was told that again I can't hear well and that the front desk clerk did a great job by giving me a 50.00 credit for the second room.

We had several families from our team stay here with us. I had never been to Indy before and knew nothing of the city, or this hotel, before my stay. Every person in our group agrees that the Staybridge was excellent in every way. To save money, many of us chose a friend to room with. I am one who likes my space so I was worried about feeling \"cooped up\" even with a friend I like very much. I shouldn't have worried. The suites were big enough that I never felt cramped. The room itself was very clean. We did a very intense \"bedbug check\" and were pleased to find the room bug free and extremely clean. The kitchen was wonderful, with beautiful granite counters. We brought lots of food with us and there was plenty of room for it all. We loved the seperate living room so the kids could go to bed early and the grown ups could stay up chatting. The only thing I didn't like is that the bathroom was in the bedroom area so someone who needs to make frequent nighttime bathroom trips may disturb the people sleeping. It made mornings a little more difficult as well. You could not get ready without waking the people who wanted to sleep longer. The lobby was nice and breakfast was really good. They offered your typical items plus a few hot items like scrambled eggs and sausage, or biscuits, or diced potatos. A little different each morning. We liked it and appreciated it on our busy competition mornings. We parked our car on our arrival day and never used it again. They had shuttles running often from any downtown location to the hotel and back. If a shuttle wasn't available the front desk called a cab, which was always there within minutes. Each ran about 5 to 10 bucks per trip, but they were van sized and between us all it was mere dollars per person and much better than driving and paying for parking each time. The shuttle drivers were friendly and knowledgable about the city. We much perferred them over the cab drivers. My daughter and I did not use the pool but our friends did and liked it very much. We were surprised at how close Lucas Oil Stadium was to the hotel. We took pictures from the hallway window and sent them to my son who is a Colts fan. He was big time jealous. Anyone staying here for a Colts game will be thrilled at the location. On our last night we were so tired we decided to order take out and the front desk clerk recommeded a pizza place. I don't remember their name but she was right on. The pizza was delicious! They had a flyer at the front desk with coupons. Use them! You won't be disappointed. Overall, I would recommed this hotel to anyone staying in downtown Indy.

Eggs, bacon, biscuit and gravy, muffins, cereal, toast, french toast, fresh fruit and more. The Pool/ Hot tub was nice a little smaller than other hotels but very quaint and clean, nice outside patio attached to the indoor pool. Gym was perfect! Oh and they have a laundry room free of charge to use! They had a mini store next to the desk where you could buy things, and the laundry detergent was a dollar. Our room was pretty big considering what our friends paid at other hotels downtown. What was even more great about it...was the mini kitchen. Had everything a kitchen at home would except smaller. The room was very contemporary, it was a mini suite, hence the name StayBridge suites. Amazing view of the Lucas Oil Stadium, literally right next to the place. Oh, one last note. The mall was big, had a great arcade, had a movie theater, plenty of food in their food court, and many nice shops. If you get a chance go to Howl at the Moon, a very great bar full of customer interaction. That to is in walking distance, although took a cab fare was 8 bucks there and back. Oh, and eat at Steak N Shake! It was yummy and cheap. $4.00 for a whole meal. Also Broad Ripple was about 15-20 min out from downtown, but had a blast there, bar hopping is great there, although Land Sharks bar was the BEST! On the other note, drinks/food were a little more pricey than my home city, and parking if you were to get a rental car such as our friends did your looking at between $18-20 dollars every where down town, even at your hotels. So I suggest walking or cab-in around town.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cGreat!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "TanTin675", "ReviewID": "UR81982170", "Content": "Our trip was great from beginning to end.

Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Check in was a breeze. It is clean, spacious and very inviting. They have a small theatre screening room with big comfy leather chairs. Perfect to watch the game highlights or sit back and watch a movie. They also have a pool. I did not use it, but it looked very nice and it stays open until 11pm! Our room was perfect for our needs. It was a studio and was quite spacious. the kitchenette is a nice touch. It allowed us to keep some beverages in the refrigerator and heat up our leftovers from our terrific dinner from the nite before. The shower was one of the best in my opinion. We both took extra long showers...the water pressure was perfect and the shower has the extended shower rod so you don't feel cramped while showering. If you attending a game at Lucas Oil Stadium...this is def the hotel. It is directly across the street and they allow tailgating in their parking lot! What could be better? The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the city center, where there are tons of restaurants and a huge mall. If you are not renting a car, i suggest you take the local shuttle to and from the airport. It's called the \"Greenline Shuttle\". This only costs $7 per person as opposed to paying roughly $40 by taxi. The shuttle drops you off directly across the street from the hotel and runs about every 20 min. I highly recommend this. Will save you $$ as well as get a little tour of center city, as the Staybridge is the last stop. Good news is, on the way back to the airport, it's only a 10-15 min ride!

After telling them that this was impossible they said they would take it down but still not as low as the price for early booking. When stating I would not stay for that price, they finally said they would take care of it for me and reduce it to what it was supposed to be, but that next time \"I should call to make sure everything is okay\". Like I'm supposed to know THEY had an issue with my credit card? After checking in we got to see the room and it was very nice and roomy. The bed was very comfortable and the suite like room is a lot nicer than an average hotel. We did have some bugs/ants in the bathroom, and the blanket smelled not very clean. The breakfast in the morning is okay; Average consiting of egg substitute ,sausage, toast and other small items. I did not appriciate having to pay $10 a night to park and then having to park my car down the street in a parking garage becuase the back lot was full. I was woken up several times in the night to people screaming and yelling in the middle of the night in a surrounding room as well as the very loud fridge kicking on. As we walked in to our room one night from the parking garage down the street, there was a very large group loitering and horseplaying in the drop off zone/ main entrance of the hotel while the desk staff sat outside, smoked and watched them be disruptive. It was a nice hotel, and I am very dissapointed to have had such a horrible experience there with staff and other things lacking.

Both the bedroom and lounge were of ample size and in addition there was a well-equipped kitchen with microwave, two-plate stove, dishwasher and a full-sized fridge. It was well-supplied with plates, utensils, etc. There were two, digital, flat-screen tvs, one in the lounge, one in the bedroom. Beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was fine.
