{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Acceptable accommodation and nice staff As most Ibis Hotels, this one provides a good price - performance ratio. The location is a little outside the city center, but you can easily get into downtown Frankfurt by public transportation within about 20-30 minutes. A subway station is located in about 3-5 minutes walking distance from the hotel. No dining options in the neighborhood, but at the next subway station there are a few. The hotel building's architecture is ugly, the rooms clean and equipped with basic comfort. The bed is too small, but let's face it... it is an Ibis. There is a small bar in the hotel with friendly service serving drinks and some snacks. If you want to have acceptable food, go somewhere else. I can recommend staying there for 1-2 nights, but don't expect anything special.", "Date": "Jan 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR723180558", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Olli65"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d200962-r12544141-Ibis_Frankfurt_City_West-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "200962", "Price": "$198"}}
