They don't do other meals, but there are enough places to eat out in Venice. Google maps aren't very helpful, but from the bus station at Piazzale Roma, simply walk right over a couple of minor bridges along the grand canal, past the major bridge over the grand canal on your left and (you have to) take a right. Second left then brings you to the church of St Simeon Grand. Go to the left and a courtyard opens up to your left, the hotel entrance faces you, slightly to your left. This is a great base, conveniently located, from which to explore Venice, both by vaporetta and simply wandering the maze of street in the general direction of major attractions, frequentl;y signposted such as Rialto and St Marks.

There were a number of mosquitoes in the room which we had to swat. We had to check out early in the morning and they couldn't offer us breakfast since the waiter didn't come in until 7:30.

It's a short walk to the train station and the bus plaza, and is convenient to a vaporetto stop. It is in a Venetian neighborhood rather than a touristy area, and is a ten-minute walk from two terrific restaurants - Il Refolo (great salads and wonderful pizza) and La Zucca (excellent vegetarian dishes and good meat dishes as well) - both of which are located near our favorite campo in all of Venice, San Giacomo del Oro. The hotel itself is charming and quite reasonably priced. On both stays our room had a view of the Grand Canal. The room was completely clean, the bathroom was small but not cramped (with a small tub with an excellent showerhead), and the breakfast was excellent with good coffee and set us up nicely for the whole day. The staff was terrific, and made advance reservations for us at both of the above-mentioned restaurants. This was important, as we arrived on the third weekend in July during a major citywide festival. My wife and I do like to walk, so it was a treat to actually enter and leave the touristy part of Venice. For those not so inclined, St. Mark's is just a vaporetto ride away.

And the hotel has a (tiny) lift, which is not to be underestimated in a city like Venice where lots of hotels do not have lifts! Breakfast was fairly standard continental style, but the great thing about it was that the hotel has a terrace where breakfast can be eaten, with good views of the area around the little square. It was a lovely way to start the morning. However, the metal steps up to the terrace were steep, so this may not be a good option for those who have impaired mobility.

He booked this hotel because he had already been there on a conference, and he liked the atmosphere. I loved my stay at Hotel Ai Due Fanali. The hotel is pretty small (just 16 rooms) and its location is excellent, very close to the railway station. I liked the location because it was pretty close to everything and it was very convenient while coming back from our walking tours, since you can easily find signs leading to the \"Ferrovia\" (=railway station in Italian) almost everywhere in Venice. And getting lost in Venice can be very easy! My husband booked a superior room for us, which cost him 120 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac per night, breakfast included. The room was \"superior\" only because of the size, much bigger that the other ones, but honestly small. The furniture was really nice and cozy. The room had also a small (and fake!) firework and wooden celing. The room was very clean as we checked in and the maid kept it very clean during our stay. I think that this hotel features many positive qualities, such as: * Price: not so high, if you consider that you are staying within Venice in a very nice lodge. Consider that the room rate could have been lower if we had booked a normal room, and we were there during the peak season; * Location: walking distance to everything, pretty close to Santa Lucia railway station (3 minutes walk), where also all ferry boats leave and arrive (to and from Venice airport, for example); * Armosphere: very romantic if you are there with your beloved one. But what I liked most was the breakfast terrace, located on the 3rd floor, from where we could enjoy an awsome view of Venice.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201clovely hotel in a practical location\u201d", "Author": "sleepyh", "ReviewID": "UR18636038", "Content": "We spent 3 nights at the ai due Fanali in Venice and had a great time.

The black-out blinds were great to keep the light out, and carpet meant there was not much noise from other rooms. The bathroom was quite pokey with a short bath but the shower was great. The TV aerial cable was just a wire attached to the TV with sellotape which didn't work very well.

The location for us was great, a short walk with our bags from the bus stop, likewise when we left we only had a short walk to the train station.
