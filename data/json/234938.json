First impressions were not good; we were on the third floor and there is no lift so check with the manager before booking if stairs are a problem. The rooms were very basic, certainly not like the one pictured on the website, very small bathroom and TV only in German (yes I know its Germany but most hotels we have stayed in abroad pick up satellite channels from other European countries) but it was clean and our request for extra pillows was dealt with promptly. On the downside we had 2 rooms, one on the back of the building and one on the front. The room on the front was very noisy right into the small hours with nearby trams and other traffic and passing revellers. The widow had very efficient double glazing but the weather was hot during our visit and the room was too hot at night with the window shut. On the plus side, the breakfast surpassed our expectations with a large and varied cold buffet and there were lots of restaurants nearby for an evening meal. It was well situated for walking to lots of the sights and the U-Bahn station was just a few minutes walk away. We travelled by train on 2 occasions and found it chewap and easy to use. Although we have criticised the hotel to some extent the price of Eu85 per night room, and breakfast is very reasonable for a city centre and we feel we had valus for money.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Savannah, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic experience thanks to the location and staff\u201d", "Author": "TheGiorgis", "ReviewID": "UR81082104", "Content": "The location was fantastic--with little cafes all around and the train station just across the street. Very centrally-located. The price was fantastic and much better than other hotels in the area. But what really made our stay great was the VERY friendly and helpful Ukrainian receptionist. She doesn't speak much English and I don't speak a word of German but we were able to understand each other. I arrived before my husband and wanted to greet him at the airport, so I asked about taxis outside. She said--in German, which I don't speak--to take the train and then the connecting bus, which is 2.10 EU as opposed to a 20 EU taxi. She cut out a train schedule for me, explained the whole thing about 3 times until I understood, and she was so excited when I came back from my successful trip to the airport. It was one of those international vacation experiences that really makes your trip. And to top it off, since I ended up choosing a smaller room when I got there because of the view, they charged me less than what they originally quoted me!", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perugia, Italy", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location but the rooms are just about OK\u201d", "Author": "TheDreamGod", "ReviewID": "UR68475525", "Content": "The hotel is close to a S-bahn and an U-bahn stations - very well connected and in addition the quarter is a very lively place.
