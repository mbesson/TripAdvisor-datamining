{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Warning - Do not book this hotel We booked this hotel in October 2005 and cancelled three days later after reading the reviews on Venere.com and Tripadvisor. The rate presented by Venere.com was 180 EUR for four nights with the right to cancel without penalty until early April 2006. A few days after our cancellation the hotel charged our credit card 300 EUR. They are not responding to our repeated requests to have our money back. Venere.com isn't helpful either.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR498590785", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Danishtraveller1"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d570284-r5825148-Antico_Oltrarno-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "570284", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
