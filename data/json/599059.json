Believe the room was actually a single (as the room next door was) with a small double, uncomfortable, bed in it. Room was kept clean but was very tired. Other reviews had cited hotel as a bit noisy but wasn't worried about this as it is in the heart of a busy nightlife city so goes with the territory. Saw other rooms which were bigger and opened out to the front (noise at night) or rear (church clock chiming every hour) but this would have been immensely preferable to the airless, dark cramped space we were given.

There are normally taxis available at all the hours but you can ask the front desk to call a radio taxi if you want to be sure.

Also the garbage collection during night time are annoying. We couldn't get a new room right away, because the hotel was full. On the third day of our stay, we could pack our bags and our luggage was moved to another room. Great service!!! The rooms were big enough. Bathroom also, but not very handy.

The hotel breakfast is in the Tapes Gaudi restaurant next door. I saw the leftovers from one table being moved to another table by the waitress, I think this is a NOGO. At least they could keep up apperances and take the leftovers back to the kitchen. At another occasion I got a plate with the breadcrumbs of the previous customer on it. Shame, because the food was good. But it's not becuase we're tourist you have to treat us like fools. Why the mixed feelings? We payed an average of 100\u20ac per day.

Overall, if you are looking for a clean, safe place to stay -- and really do want to stay in the heart of the city -- Hotel Ingles is perfect. Don't expect anything more than bare-bones, however; I have stayed in many hotels and hostels while traveling throughout Europe and would say that Hotel Ingles, despite its having private rooms, really is equal if not less than top-quality hostels I've stayed in in terms of amenities provided. One last caution: Hotel seems to have strange policy of making guests leave room keys at reception while out for the day, only to pick them up when they come back in the evening.

As already pointed out in the previous reviews, it is just off Las Rambles, about half way between Placa Catalunya and the harbour. This is a great spot as you are in walking distance of many of the main attractions, and there is also a underground station (Liceu) at the top of the street. The hotel itself appears to be just a doorway between two tapas bars, but it has quite a few rooms over several floors. It is basic, but our room was very spacious, with a reasonably sized en suite bathroom. All was clean and tidy, with fresh towels each day. Our room also had a small balcony. The street was noisy until quite late, but the double glazing of the windows drowned out most of this noise. There was no air-con - not a problem for us but I imagine would be an issue in the height of summer. The room also had a safe available (3E per night charge) which was really useful, especially as Barcelona has a bad press for pickpockets etc, so it was good not to have to carry everything round all the time. The hotel does not serve food, but there are many many places to eat, both for breakfast and dinner, in the surrounding area.Tip - Do try to eat off Las Ramblas, the quality of the food will be better and the price drastically reduced! The staff were helpful and friendly, and we were able to leave our cases when we checked out as our flight was not until late that evening. When we returned for the cases after a hot day sightseeing, we were even able to use their WC facilities to freshen up and change before heading to the airport, which was great. All in all a great little find for a cheap and cheerful break!", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kilkenny, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cCheap and cheerful\u201d", "Author": "Siobhan_d13", "ReviewID": "UR27304377", "Content": "Spent three nights here with my boyfriend in February 09. Went on a budget and the hotel was only 150euro for the three nights. Very basic but comfortable - double bed with en-suite. Located just a few metres off La Ramblas on La Boqueria. Loads of attractions nearby. Receptionists very friendly and rooms were very clean. Not fancy at all but it did the job! We didn't spend much time in the room as there's just so much to do in Barcelona. Would definitely return here if we were to go back sightseeing again.
