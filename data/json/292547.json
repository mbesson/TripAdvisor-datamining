{"Reviews": [{"Content": "It was Acceptable........ The hotel is very close to the train station which is great considering you don't want to drag you luggage through Florence. The elevator was very small, but like many other ones I've seen in Italy. Our room was adequate and actually pretty cute and the staff were very nice and helpful. The only problems that I had with the place were that they don't turn the heat on until the end of October and it kind of smelled like a bar in the hallway because the people at the front desk sat and chainsmoked in the breakfast room. It will fit your needs and price range if you're not looking for anything fancy, but I think there are a lot of places in Florence that would do the same.", "Date": "Nov 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR175961290", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ShawneeK1"}, {"Content": "perfectly serviceable hotel Location is good (walking distance to train station).

It was ok, but nothing to brag about. First of all, don't stay here if you have a car! Book somewhere with parking. The location would have been great if we were coming by train though. But, there is no parking, the staff did not understand/speak enough English to suggest where to park, so we parked at the train station and ended up paying over 60 euros per night for parking. I was hoping for a quaint hotel, and this was not it. This hotel is actually one floor of a building which on each floor of the building there is another hotel or a business. The breakfast was fair. We were able to walk everywhere during the day, so the location is good (you don't need a car in Florence). The room was nice and clean and the bathroom was fine as well.

Our family of four stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in early June 2007 (booked direct with hotel). We were quite satisfied with our stay. The room was large, the beds were comfortable, and it was clean. Sheets,  towels provided. The A/C worked well. The breakfast room is very charming with a pretty view outside, and the buffet is decent. The front desk people were friendly and helpful, providing maps, directions, etc. The decor was a little worn in our particular room, but still gracious, and I noticed some even prettier rooms near ours (the doubles).Our bidet had a slow leak at the floor base which was the only item of annoyance, but no big deal really. Also, there is a little bit of street noise, but mostly during the rush hour times, not noticable by us at night. I honestly don't think there would be many places in this price range (if any) where you could avoid all street noise, as Florence is pretty concentrated and busy with motorcycles and cars. We felt that the price was very good (130 eu/nt for 4 people incl. breakfast) for what we received. The hotel is only 5-8 minutes walking from the train station. We could walk to all the major sites, though it might take 20 minutes or so to reach the farthest ones. There's lots to see along the way, so it's a good way to see the city.

It was a very easy walk to the Duomo and the other major sights. Most of all, I was pleased by the charm of our room. Painted furniture, high ceilings, huge stained glass windows, patterned tile floors. We were on the street, but the enormous wooden shutters you can see in the pictures on the website actually close, giving you a double layer of insulation--I didn't have any problem with the noise.

The owner's wife speaks the best english and understands your English, so she's the one to talk to if you have problems.Our family of seven stayed there for 5 nights taking three rooms. The single smelled of sewage, and was incredibly small (as most singles tend to be) so my niece was moved to another room the next day.We've traveled extensively so understand, most rooms in Europe are smaller than American's are used to. Being a three star hotel, you can't expect the spacious lobby/bar/reception area that you'd have at a more expensive hotel.As mentioned, this hotel is on the second (read 3rd in English, the 1st floor bing the ground floor). The elevator is large enough for your suitcases, and you walk up the flights - great for your buns!For some reason in Florence, most bathrooms have a drain in the floor and the shower is rather open - meaning, it's going to get the entire bathroom wet, usually.The foursome had the corner room which was large. Their bath had a 'fixed' shower that did not get water all over. Our niece was moved to the room next to them, again larger than most, but she had the 'fold-up' shower as did we. Out room was down the hall across from reception, and definitely the most beautiful with stained glass window and gorgeous furniture.All rooms had windows you could open to the street. In the quad, there were two windows which created a nice cross draft when you didn't want air condition. Both the corner room and the next to it were bothered by revelers in the street one night. Our room remained quiet.We found the staff to be most helpful and cordial, although their English wa s limited. We especailly liked the cheery breakfast room with morning sunlight and a flower draped balcony. The staff worked to keep the tables cleared and provide hot coffee/tea/rolls/cereal - the usual for Europe.The location was good, very close to the train station which we used and the bus which we took up to the Piazza Michaelangelo. Florence is small and walkable so bring good shoes.The owner suggested Za-Za's in the Piazza Mercado. That and the restaurant next to it were the best we dined at in Florence. Other than baths which are all tight quarters in Florence, we found this hotel a bargain for location and price.
