It was so bad that we booked the rest of our vacation at another hotel and didnt even care if we missed out on money! First of all when we got there at 3 to check in we were told our room WASNT available!! And we didnt get in a room until 7! We were never offered any money back or anything! It made us late for our Broadway show! Then when we got back to the hotel that night we discovered how digusting the room was! There was black human hair ALL over the bedspreads! Their was garbage in the bathroom and the shower curtain would NOT stay closed! So when we showered the floor got soaked!! They also told us they didnt have anymore towels when we asked so we had 2 towels for 3 girls! The room was freezing! When we went down to ask for blanklets they said they didnt have any and offered a space heather...seriously!? a space heater!? Their was one window in the room with NO curtains!! You could see right out and anyone could see right in! And worst of all their was a room right by the bathroom and it had a broken bed in it and it was piled with about 15 bags of trash! Thats is not even close to sanitary!! How are they not embarrassed to let someone rent that room!!!??? We ended up getting a much more wonderful hotel the next morning for only an additional 50 a night. Well worth it! I do not recommend this place. OH! And the hotel is the smallest elevator in the history of elevators! All three of us girls could BARELY fit in there!!! HORRIBLE HOTEL!

When we initially booked the hotel we were quite worried and didn't really know what to expect after reading previous reviews on here. The night we arrived in New York our family wanted us to call home to make sure we had landed safe, after a while trying to use the pay phone in reception we gave up as it just kept rejecting our calls. We informed the guy at reception and he told us to return to our room and he'd sort it out so we could use the phone in our room to call home. True to his word he did and we quickly made a call, after returning to reception to say thank you and pay him he told us not to worry which we thought was really nice considering we were calling back to the UK. They also allowed us to do this the day we were leaving. As for our room when we booked the holiday we booked for a room with a double bed and to our surprise when we opened the door we had 2! The room itself was fairly small with a rail on the wall for hanging clothes and a small TV facing the bed. The bathroom again was small with a bath/shower, toilet and sink but overall for the time you spend in your room and what you use the room for it was excellent. The hotel is situated in a good walking distance from everything. The staff are very friendly (Especially helping us out when we needed a first aid box) and the hotel is perfect if all you want is somewhere to sleep, wash and drop shopping off through your day.

That makes them a rare honesty among Times Square hotels. Tucked away on 38th street you have a close walk to the Times Square action. The rooms are very small, even for NY standards. Despite being a budget hotel, at least the furniture is modern, the bead clean and the bathroom is actually 3-star quality. The bathroom featured and amazon double shower-head , one fixed and one mobile, with 6 extra sprinklers coming at you from the wall in front. I'd never experienced such a fancy shower all my life! Shows they at least try to make the best of things. Staff is friendly and helpful and showed me the way to the nearby post office and laundromat on 9th avenue. When I arrived, a girl was complaining that the hotel looked nothing like the pictures on the internet. I checked now and to my opinion the pictures are representative. This is a $100 dollar a night hotel room in the Times Square area. You should keep NY housing prices in mind and understand that you will get a very small room without any windows. If you are a classy girl, get a boyfriend with more money to go the Hilton, because this is just not your hotel. For people with budgets, this hotel is fine.

We walk into the place and it's a small, dark hallway entrance. The staff was friendly enough but as we took the single tiny elevator to our room, we had to make two trips so we could fit in the elevator with our luggage. The room was about the size of a single-person freshman college dorm room only I know when I was in college, those dorm rooms were actually nicer and cleaner. The room was filthy. The phone looked like it had been thrown against the wall about 12 times but it worked. The beds were hard and sheets were dirty. The old A/C unit worked but was level with the beds so if you're stuck in that bed the A/C blows on you and you'll probably get sick too (or at least freeze all night). The bathroom was small and disgusting. We had to call down to the front desk to get an iron and ironing board as this wasn't in the room. There was no closet but a small rack on the wall to hang things. The place had one ice machine on the bottom floor so I guess that's better than none, but just something you expect. From seeing the place I wouldn't have been surprised at all if the police had raided one of the rooms to bust some degenerate. It seems like one of those places where you'd see them catch a scumbag on Law & Order. We kept our doors locked the entire time for fear of armed robbery. I'm sure the place rents these rooms by the hour to hookers. The only other positive I can think of is that after getting back from a night out, we didn't come back to find all of our possessions stolen. Of course, you wouldn't list that as a positive at a normal hotel you just expect it. This place is ideal for a homeless person that would like 4 walls and a roof over their heads. I could also see poor college kids on a budget cramming in here for an nyc weekend trip because in college you're generally used to living in filth.

There werent any bath towels or washcloths in the bathroom, so we went downstairs to get some and they gave us mismatched torn beach towels with sailboats and pastel stripes.There was a screw stuck in the faucet so we could turn the water on(see picture below).

My friend and i actually stripped the beds of all the linens and slept in our clothes.

I asked for the elevator and they pointed to the corner. It barely fit 3 people. And took forever to get to the lobby. I get to the room and open the door and wasn't exactly what I expected. So before I writing this review I noticed something about the pictures on their website... they are computer generated previews like what you see on HGTV of what your room WILL look like when its done. Well, the rooms look nothing like those computer generated images. I walked into the room and saw two beds, with mis-matched bedding. When I went to the bathroom, the \"floor mat\" looked like an old beach towel. The toilet leaked. The beds were not very comfortable, and the only reason we were able to sleep was because we had all been up all night out on the town and were dead tired. I even saw a bug (roach maybe) walk across the wall. The room was hot, but the \"a/c\" (room cooler, the kind you stick in the window) did its job in cooling down the room. Room was pretty small, we kept tripping over our luggage (and we packed LIGHT). I mean I guess you get what you pay for in NYC, b/c I visited in September 2008 and paid twice as much but had an awesome hotel. The location was great, as we were able to walk to so many things. Would I stay again? Not if I can afford to pay a little more.

I think the bathtub may have actually been a jacuzzi at one point, but the jets were sealed over... Shower worked nicely. We saw absolutely NO bugs or rodents of any kind while we were there. The only noise we heard was in the hallways when housekeeping was out making rounds, or when there were people in the hallways making a lot of loud noises....so a bit more like a college dorm or an apartment in terms of hallway noise as well. We were on the 3rd floor, and I didn't really hear any street noise from where we were. Our room was also well-heated. The only problem we had was shortly before we left, when the toilet got clogged, and the plunger that was provided with the bathroom (which I think is a good idea; I see few hotels that do this, and I would really rather plunge my own toilet and save the embarrassment of calling someone else to do it for me) didn't work as well as it should have... But we let them know about it on checkout, and the lady at the desk made a note about it in the logs and thanked us for telling her, so I assume they sent someone to fix the toilet and maybe replace the plunger. Kudos to them for being on top of things. I would totally stay here again, though. The location is FANTASTIC -- we walked everywhere we went, no need to take any taxis at all. :) (Not sure if I would recommend for business travelers though, since our room did not include a desk. This did not affect us at all, however, since we were just tourists who needed a comfortable place to sleep at night.)", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cDirty Horrible Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Wolser", "ReviewID": "UR12196394", "Content": "Was expecting hotel to be poor if not terrible after reading reviews on trip advisor.

On hindsight, we should have taken heed of the advice. Lack of Space: On first impressions we were absolutely shocked, particularly as the furnishing were old-fashioned and musty, when we had requested an 'upgraded' room. In fact, we had the largest room in the hotel, which consisted of two queen sized beds and an old sagging bunker bed squeezed into one room. The only other room was taken by our suitcases, leaving no room for walking. Cleanliness/Hygiene: this was definitely most shocking. Before having even slept on the beds, we found stray hairs on the pillow cases. Feeling revolted, we had to cover our pillows with towels, and sprayed disinfectant on all the covers. There was no evidence of room service- we stayed for 2 nights and the beds were not made, nor were the sheets changed. Bathroom: the hot water was extremely difficult to adjust. It was small, cramped and once again, old. Location: This was possibly the only highlight of the hotel. It was so close to Times Square that we stayed out as late as we possibly could every night, haunting the 24hr cafe (which buy the way has the most delicious gourmet deserts that we even remember the name- \"Hot n Crusty\") so that we would not have to sleep in the beds. Price: the value was definitely overpriced for what it was worth. We only stayed for two nights, more out of misfortune than anything, as we had booked the rest of our stay at NY in Hotel Beacon, that was BY FAR cheaper, and what i definitely would call 4.5 star service. THERE i felt like i was on a holiday. although it was a bit further from Times Sqaure, i'd rather pay a taxi than stay uncomfortably at a cheaper place.

I didn't see it right away, there was a small sign sticking out above two shops. There is no lobby, just a hallway with a desk built into the wall and an elevator the only fits 2 people max and barely fit our 2 bags. The first room we were given was 8x8 and had a double bed with a twin and about 4 inches of space between the 2 beds. This was unexceptable (since I had booked 2 doubles), so back downstairs I went. The second room was 8x10 and had 2 doubles with 4inches between them and about 3 feet of space between the bathroom and the end of the bed, so back downstairs I went to plead for the room in the photo(which I really don't think existed). I finally received a 12x12 room with 2 double beds and about a foot seperating them and I was soooo tired by this time that I gave in and took the room. There was a blow dryer but no towels, soap, shampoo or wash cloth and the TV was a 12in prtable put on a tv stand suspended from the corner of the room, suprisingly it had a good picture, but so does my ipod. Now, since we came to shop, we did not need a fancy place and wanted to try to save a little money. I have stayed in inexpensive hotels in New York and was pleasantly surprised. But I want to warn anyone who stays here, this hotel is below basic standards and amenities. That means there is a bed and a toilet...nothing else.

This hotel truly was awful, but it gave me some excellent memories and a great experience in New York City. We stayed here a few years back now, and the only reason I'm writing my review now, is because it's late at night and me and my fiancee are laughing our heads off reading the other reviews of this hotel, after a conversation reminiscing on one great vacation we took. After reading these reviews, I can only imagine it has gotten worse in the last few years, but here's my story. My fiancee and I, along with two of our best friends arrived in NYC. It was in the middle of one of the worst heat waves on record, and we were in our early twenties and loose in Manhattan. This hotel is where we made our homebase. At the time, it only cost $100 per night, and we crammed all four of us into one room. We arrived, and walked into the single door, down the dirty narrow hallway to the \"lobby\" which is well described by other reviewers so I'll spare you the redundancy. Except for the fact that there was an eldery guest in the lobby who told us to leave now, and go stay somewhere else. We didnt listen. The elevator is tiny, and we all barely fit, but we made our way up to the fourth floor where our room was. (We never took the elevator a second time.) The deadbolt on our door didnt fit into the hole in the door frame, so we called down to the front. They told us someone would be right up...and they were. Some dude arrived right away, cigarette dangling from his mouth, and grinder in hand. He proceeded to grind away at our door frame, without any safety goggles at all, and without taking the cigarette out of his mouth, and the sparks were flying and bouncing all over the curtains and carpet. But hey, then the deadbolt worked. So, I mentioned we were on the 4th floor, and there are only 5 floors in the hotel. But, the fifth floor was closed for construction, which meant the staircase had a blanket taped up blocking its way....Not enough to stop a few adventurous twenty-somethings, to be sure. We boldly went behind the blanket, and ventured up the stairs to see what secrets the fifth floor held. When we got to the top of the stairs, we found a doorway to the roof. And I mean a doorWAY...no door was attached. So out we went. The roof had lots of great stuff on it, like toilets, bricks, and believe it or not... A REAL SIGN for the hotel! A nice big one, just lying there. Anyways, so we went back to our room, and like i said it was so damn hot we all had to take showers at least twice a day. So we go into the shower, and realize there's a curtain on the wall inside the bathtub. We pulled back the curtain, and revealed a nice big WINDOW. In the shower. Looking out into the alley where the band rehearses. During the day, when we went out sightseeing, the staff would sneak into our room and turn off our air conditioner. They did this everyday, even after we asked them to stop. Oh, one last thing...when we we're out late, and returning for the night, one night there was some dude urinating on the door of the hotel, so we waited for him to finish, then we rang the buzzer to be let in the front door. The guy manning the desk came, opened the door for us, nervously scanned the empty street, and hurried us inside, locking the door behind us.

Room airconditioners are finicky, sometimes work and sometimes don't. When we complained that the airconditioners didn't work, the manager got very angry and threatened to kick us out. Not really sure why, maybe because it was late? The nightshift worker had to call the manager at around 11:30pm.

Stay away! Stay away!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2879583", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I travel frequently on business, and have for well over 20 years. I ended up staying here last week because I failed to account for the NYC Christmas crowds, and was unable to get a room at one of the places at which I usually stay. Every negative review you read here is 100% right on! Anything positive you read here is inaccurate and misleading. (I must note though that the hotel staff themselves were all friendly and tried their best to be accomodating. They simply don't have much to work with here.) The simple fact is that this hotel should not be allowed to operate as is. I have stayed in many, many different places all over the world, and have never experienced anything as bad as this. Like a couple of the other reviewers, I too merely needed a place to sleep, and wasn't overly concerned about the lack of amenities. (The last I heard however, \"cleanliness\" and \"sanitary\" weren't considered \"amenities\".) There are far too many things wrong with this place to list, but I'll try. It is unclean - and I mean everything. The entrance, lobby (if you can call it that), the shoebox sized elevator, the hallways, the room (and every single thing in it), and the bathroom. The sheets were threadbare and did not appear or smell clean, there were clumps of hair on the pillows which certainly weren't mine. (It was to the point that I wondered if they rented these rooms out by the hour during the day, when most of the patrons were either working or out sightseeing.) The walls and ceiling were badly stained. The carpeting almost defies description - filthy indoor/outdoor carpeting, which kind of \"crackled\" when you walked on it, and which was cut out around the bed and dresser, as though whoever put it in was too lazy to move the furniture first. The mattress was as hard as a rock, and also provided that lovely \"crackling\" sound when you sat in it. (My therapist has advised me that it would be in my best interest to try to forget the details of the \"comforter\" on top of the bed.) The bathroom lterally had piles of debris/hair/ etc... in each corner. I wanted to wear my shoes in the tub, never mind even considering taking a bath in it. No shampoo was provided of course. I am thankful that it wasn't summertime, because I have no doubt that the place would be chock full of bugs, cockroaches, and who knows what else. I had to scrub the dresser drawers before I put my clothing in them. I lined them with plastic bags as well. Let's see, none of the windows were openable, there were noisy, inconsiderate people coming and going all night long - up and down the 5 foot wide hallways, making no effort whatsoever to try to be quiet. The neighborhood, although not the best/safest, and certainly not what you are led to expect (by hotels or Expedia) by any stretch of the imagination, wasn't terrible, and was convenient to Times Square and the Theater District. The TV got about 20 channels - of these, 3 were in Spanish, 3 were Oriental, and most of the balance didn't come in well enough to either watch or listen to. From the outside, this hotel bears absolutely no resemblance to the picturesque little brownstone you see on the Internet. It is a squat, drab little place, with the word \"Hotel\" handwritten on the back of a sheet of printer paper, taped to the door. (There were some sort of dead, skinned fowl (I think they were ducks) hanging in the window immediately to the left of the entrance. There is also apparently a place very nearby that has been rented to a fledgling rock band (and trust me, they are very early on in their careers), which is used for their nightly practice session, which thankfully seemed to wrap up at about 10:30 PM. It is also billed as an \"Internet Cafe\". This portion of their business consisted of two computers on TV trays (or something similar) in the already crowded lobby. I didn't see anything that would render the term \"Cafe\" an appropriate name for the business. When I returned home, I washed everything, whether I had worn it or not, and brought my suits and ties to the dry cleaners. (I neglected to mention that there wasn't a closet in my room - I was forced to hang all of my clothes on the wall-mounted clothes rod, for all the world to see while the maid was \"cleaning??\" my room.) I should also mention that this is the second room I had here - I was in the first one for about 30 seconds before I was on the (dirty, sticky) phone calling the front desk insisting on a different room. They were equally disgusting, but at least in the second room, I was able to get into the bathroom without the need to sandwich myself against the filthy wall and slide sideways into it. (I am not a big person either - 5'8\" and 155 lbs). As for climate controls - there was no lack of heat, in fact there was no controlling the heat. It was stifling all night long. I peeled off the \"comforter\" and \"blanket\" and just slept with the dirty sheet. (Even now I shudder at the recollection.) I am most surprised that this was listed as a halfway decent place on Hotels. In fact, the only reason I remained here was due to the fact that as I had booked the room on hotels, I had already paid for it. I sensed that if I mentioned anything about a refund to the person at the front desk, I would have been laughed out into the street. (Which in itself would have been an upgrade.) The room was not inexpensive - $109/night for the first few nights and then $149/night for the final night. The bottom line is that people should not be expected to shell out that kind of money and then end up in a place like this. If this is the new baseline for price/value in NYC, then shame on the hotel industry. My advice would be to either plan your trip well in advance, and you absolutely can get a decent room in this price range (or even for slightly less) in the city, albeit with a little advance planning; or as an alternative, simply budget a little more for this expense. If you can't afford to spend a little more, you would be well-advised to postpone your trip untilyou can.

The entrance is nestled between other businesses with a glass door and on the entrance on a piece of white computer paper and magic marker was the word HOTEL. I thought to myself, okay this doesn't look so good to me. Well we all walked down this skimpy dingy hall to a desk where there was a woman waiting. I gave her my name and she told me sign here. I said to her that I wanted to check the room out. She said to get the key I had to sign. Well we started to walk up the stairs and she said no...no... go the elevator. We started to go into the elevator and when two of us got in and were staring face to face and the other people hadn't even gotten in yet, I said..nope guys...we walk. So we walked up three flights of steps to the so called suite. Upon walking through these dingy halls, there were people lurking about. When my son opened the door....I nearly fell over. There leaning against the wall were two mattresses. The sleeper sofa looked like it fell off of a garbage truck and the door separating the so called sofa sleeper and mattresses on the wall area from the beds, were shower doors. On the opposite side where the beds that look as if they came out of a dumpster were situated, were these mismatched junky bed spreads in this foul smelling room. I looked at the rest of my people and said NO WAY! I marched down to the steps and told the woman no way. She said no way? I said no...no way will we stay in this place. She said too bad, you booked room you must pay for one night. I said whatever....I am getting out of here. I did not feel safe at all. After I left I called and spoke to a man who said that \"YOU PAY\" we kept that room open for you all day. I truly doubt anyone would want that space. I asked him for my money back and he refused. I phoned Hotels and told them that they should know what kind of a place they are booking people into. I didnt even ASK for this place specifically by name, I just asked for a hotel in NYC. When I left there, we got two really nice quality rooms at the Milford Plaza Hotel and it cost less there for two rooms than the DUMP Manhattan Broadway. People should be aware of this place. It is absolutely the pits! Nothing you can even imagine. HORRIBLE!!!! I told Hotels about the situation and after they reviewed it with their supervisor they told me they could only give me back $70.00. I asked them what kind of a kick back do they get from such a dive joint like this if they can only give me back $70.00 when they were the ones who suggested and booked it for me in the first place. What a horrible mess!!!

The room and bathroom were very clean and the staff was very helpful. The only problem (and to five females it was a big one) and surprise was that we saw several cockroaches!! I was very surprised as it all looked very clean. I think the attached restaraunt (a small chinese diner style place) is the culprit here. We all had trouble sleeping because of this, thank god we were only there for two nights and were not in the room except to sleep and shower. Ths day staff was great and we had plenty of heat once we asked for it. I have to say if it weren't for the bugs I would recommend this hotel but I will never go back, I hate bugs!!!!!", "Date": "November 16, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Manhattan Broadway Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d122007-Reviews-Manhattan_Broadway_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$195 - $386*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">273 West 38th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10018</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514486", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/5c/01/64/manhattan-broadway-hotel.jpg"}}
