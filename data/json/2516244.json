They have recently completed renovations of the guest rooms to a modern look. The sitting area is an improvement both cosmetically and functionally. The bathroom door is still odd (it swings out into the living area). I saw a \"model\" of the renovations a few months ago, and could have sworn they changed the door to a sliding door that hugged the wall. They must have changed their mind, but it is still an improvement over the salon style doors from the old rooms. The bathroom is fresh and modern. No more tub, which is fine by me, but the new shower is long and narrow. I am average in size and felt it was a bit cramped (width). I would think larger people would not be happy. The water pressure was a tad on the low side and I had NO HOT WATER on day two (and I was not alone, many people complained). Although I did not watch TV during my stay, many people in my group complained they had no TV signal in their room. My TV remote in the bedroom did not work. When I checked the batteries, I noticed that they were leaking. If you like to go for a run, the area around is not real conducive to a long run. I did find a park nearby, but it is better suited for hiking, as there is quite a change in elevation. There was also no bellman service during my visit. Not sure if they cut back or if it was the time of year - they were pretty busy so, I don't think it was due to the time of year. On a good note, your stay does include the made to order breakfast, which is decent. The lines were long, but they moved quickly. It also includes the complimentary managers reception each might. The beer and hard liquor choices were poor and inconsistent with other Embassy Suites - the selection seems to be hit or miss (I assume they are independently owns and operated). Being in Napa, I would have expected a better selection. I do not drink wine, so I have no comment on their wine selection. Overall, a good place and good Value, but there is room for improvement.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer W", "ReviewID": "UR128438406", "Content": "This hotel has the best court yard!

We have always been very pleased with staying here, until this year. A couple of people from the planning committee arrived one day early to find the hotel was under remodel. The remodeled rooms look great!! They have more available room the way they have reorganized the furnishings. However, we had contracted for a certain number of double rooms and were shorted by 9, which were king beds. The hotel compensated us for those lost double rooms and had trays sent up for those in Kings. During the week, the noise level of the remodel was very loud, but that was under control by Thursday when the ladies began to arrive. Some of the problem areas: our speakers had arrived on Monday, and could not access the free internet because their HiltonHHonors account is British and this hotel's website could not read it. They have an assortment of computers, pads, and phones, so if they were to use all these, it would have cost them $50.00 per day for the 6 days they were there for internet service. They travel worldwide, and had never stayed in a hotel that could not bundle these for them. Later, 2 ladies both had their curling irons on and it set off the fire alarm. The rooms were 63 degrees during the day and they do not turn on the heat until evening. They will bring up a radiator type heater if you call down to complain. My friend and I had our blow driers working at the same time and blew a fuse. We were told there was nothing they could do, we would have to work on our heir one at a time. We were spending one extra night, in a room next to the speakers. A family with 6 small kids (apparently all under the age of 7) checked in. Instead of putting them in a couple of rooms the conference ladies had vacated, they put half on either side of our rooms. The kids then raced back and forth for the next 3 hours. Later we learned that our visitor from England had had to endure a dog howling for over 2 hours before calling the front desk, who told her there was no dog because they had no contract for a dog. She finally went down to the front desk where she was told there was no one available to go up and check, that there was no dog. She informed them she was available to wait until someone was available. So finally they sent someone up, who of course heard the dog howling for HIMSELF (you mean people actually sneak large dogs into their rooms, then leave them to howl for hours to entertain the other guests who are trying to get some rest????) Of course they did!! We were not happy at all with the attitudes of: we can do nothing about smoke alarms going off or the rooms being so cold, or having to reset the electricity to the room when 2 appliances are being used simultaneously. The positive: the staff are all very friendly and do what THEY are allowed to do to assist. Especially one gentleman behind the desk, David. He went over and beyond, and we really appreciate him.

True it's not in the heart of Napa yet it's right off Hwy. 29 which is very convenient. We stayed at the Embassy Suites Napa a few years ago, and decided to return due to having to use up airline points. We can't fault the staff as the front desk were efficient and helpful as were the breakfast attendants. However, the hotel room sure could use a major update. The decor is outdated, the sofa hasn't got much support, the shower and toilet are clean but need to be updated. Worse were the floppy bed pillows which frankly did not smell clean. Also the bathroom has just two tiny hooks attached to the door. There were no towel racks anywhere! They only provide a tiny hutch to place the clean, folded towels. Where do they expect the guests to do with them once they use them?? They could have attached some racks on the shower walls against the opposite side of the shower like many chain hotels do. It is very impractical and quite irritating to not have anything but those two itty bitty hooks. Speaking of the bathroom door it's weird. It's not a regular door but a swinging sort of door though it's complete. It's not appropriate. Thus, there is no lock on the door since it's in two pieces. Hopefully whomever you share the room with will not open the door on you accidentally. In addition, the rooms have very little insulation so one can hear the neighbors' noises from talking to slamming of their doors. The rooms we've had on both visits face the pool where the walkway to the rooms are wooden so when the guests walk and drag luggage on it the noise is quite apparent in the rooms. The windows facing the front of the hotel/street are thin and should really be replaced as the noise can be heard in the room. In short, this is a well-located hotel for the wine country and beyond, but it appears that the hotel management haven't made all that many updates over the years. And while the location is probably the main selling point for the hotel, they do charge some seriously high rates, and truly the hotel ought to make the necessary updates to justify charging so much and not rely on location alone.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel with a relaxing setting\u201d", "Author": "travelgogo", "ReviewID": "UR86293872", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights-we enjoyed the relaxed and beautiful atmosphere of the lobby, the breakfast area, and the courtyard .

If you're looking to book this hotel -- don't! Book Best Western Elm House Inn instead, several people we met stayed there and loved it. Or stay in St. Helena, Calistoga or in Sonoma at El Pueblo Inn -- no need to stay in the city of Napa. Pros: -- the breakfast is OK. It's an omelet. It's far from a great omelet or breakfast. It's just there and \"free\" unless you consider $30 per day for internet and taxes \"free.\" The cook was nice, she was far more friendly than the hotel lobby staff. -- breakfast time, starts 6:30. My mom is an early riser, so this was great. Few other places have breakfasts served early. But then none of the wineries or shops open until 9/10am and there isn't much else to do. Cons: -- $10 wireless internet. That should be criminal to charge per room, after charging $180 already. They have a business center that has two old and slow computers, and charge per page printed. -- $4 bottle of water in the hotel room. -- $20 suite tax added to room along with CA Hotel Tax. -- None of the hotel staff was friendly or helpful with information about Napa. -- The \"happy hour\" drinks bartender didn't know how to make a Manhattan. They serve ONE wine in happy hour, in the middle of Napa, ONE wine, and it's a mass-distributed wine, nothing local or special. It's as if they're pretending they're not in Napa!! -- the room was terrible. The thermostat/air conditioner didn't work - we had it set to 68 but it was hot and stuffy most of the time. The showerhead attachment came out of the wall, the toilet handle was hanging out of the toilet. The shower had very little pressure and was just above luke-warm.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cBuyers Beware!\u201d", "Author": "rebeccaweir", "ReviewID": "UR64541456", "Content": "We selected this Hilton Family Hotel for our 1st wedding anniversary because of its seemingly pretty grounds and large, suite-style rooms.

The bathroom was different having french doors, not a problem for us, but some don't like that they don't lock. They also have a little recycling bin in the room which was awesome, I'm a big recycler. We ate breakfast every morning at the hotel. They have a nice hot breakfast including choice of eggs, omelets, hashbrowns, bacon, sausage, and pancakes. I had a hot breakfast the first morning, but stuck with cereal, toast and fruit the other 2 mornings. They even had Kashi Heart to Heart cereal...score! Although I should have taken an extra box to save as they were out of it our last morning. We always got to breakfast by 9am and it wasn't that bad waiting for the hot food or finding a spot to sit. Make sure to visit the Concierge and ask about the wineries. We actually went to ask about shipping our wine back home that we bought in the Valley and he hooked us up with a bunch of free or 2 for 1 tasting tickets. The nice thing is that they don't expire, so we have some saved for our next trip. He marked a bunch of wineries on a map for us that he recommended. He also recommended buying some wines at JV warehouse in Napa to save money. We did found some wine there and were able to get it for a few dollars cheaper. However, some wineries only sell at the winery. Amenities included a nice indoor pool and hot tub. We went to the hot tub twice and it is nice and hot...103 degrees! I couldn't stay in it very long. There is also a small pool outside. They have a small \"gift shop\", but it's just a closet like room with a few toiletries. They charge about $10 for 24 hours of wi-fi if interested. Their reception at night was a big hit with everyone, but we didn't check it out. We were usually coming back from the wineries and getting ready for dinner at the time. There are also 4 swans that live at the hotel and can be seen in the courtyard or in the pond/fountain. So, yes, they will ship your wine home to you. We had them ship us our 6 bottles. You just turn in the bottles with a form (pick one up when you check in) and they pack it and ship it. We shipped regular ground for $20 and had our wine the Thurs of that week (we left on Mon). Looking at all states for 6 bottles, the average price is about $30 for ground, $60 for 3 day, $80 for 2 day, and $100 for next day. All in all, a great hotel with a very helpful concierge.

We switched our suite without problem and got one overlooking the pool on one side and the entrance way on the other. Also, try for a suite on the top floor so you don't hear people walking around, opening doors, etc. above you.

If spending time at wineries or downtown then location is key -especially if using taxis/limos. From what i could tell, the majority of hotels are off/near the main road because there is only one main road. I never heard traffic and I'm a light sleeper but I always have earplugs and eyeshades. The hotel will pack and ship your wine to any state using 3rd party shipper and was less expensive to ship than wineries; plus some winery shippers could not ship to all states. Fun tip: we arrived at 2pm on first day, then taxi to downtown to purchase $20 tasting card next to visitor center and walked to 4 wineries before 5pm closing times and then stayed for thurs night's festival. 2nd day - limo to 5 wineries; highly recommend - grgich, *cakebread, *nickel, *robert synskey, chandone (*reserv required).

The omelet was delectable; the courtyard is really a site to see. My mom was taken in by it and our room overlooked it. Again, the room was spacious and clean and had a refrigerator. The staff was very friendly. Cons: the sofa was a rock! I really like relaxing and watching TV but I found it most undesirable and my mom was already in bed where the second TV was. The bathroom could use an extra hook for hanging a towel. No bellman EVER. Again, we are not in need of someone to drag our luggage to the room but opening a door would really be appreciated and is always a welcoming sign to guests staying at any hotel.

Many people in our group complained about the a/c...the lowest setting you can put it on is 65, but in reality the thermostats are just decoration, and do nothing to cool the room. Finally we were told that they actually turn off the air conditioners at nine o'clock at night b/c some people get too cold. That's about the lamest thing I've ever heard. Obviously they turn off the a/c's to save money. My thought on that is if they can't afford to run the equipment, they shouldn't be offering the service.

Overall the hotel matches out to the prior reviews, and was a pleasant stay. This hotel is a good example of a unique item found in the Embassy Suites chain that I have not run into elsewhere. It appears to have been single\u2019s apartments converted into a hotel. (Arizona has several Embassies like this) This has some good & bad points, the good is the grounds as noted, but the room layout is rather strange with a full sink in the bedroom with a full bathroom right outside the bedroom. And overall I\u2019ve found this type to always be in average shape with some parts really needing updating. Furnishings were in good condition, but slightly dated and we have the brown shutter room so we got the one old, one new TV. And we had the strange dated bar/kitchen. Check in on a Saturday during the summer, expect delays getting your room as this place is busy. (Check in itself was quick) And get to breakfast early, it gets crowded by 9 AM but the staff in the kitchen is one of the fastest short order kitchens I\u2019ve ever seen. We had a room facing one of the parking lots so noise wasn\u2019t a problem, and overall the guests were pretty quiet when using the many outside areas for relaxing. But to get around the area & to get to dinner, it was great. For dinner, highly suggest Julia\u2019s Kitchen at COPIA, we got a last minute table easily and it was much more of a local\u2019s place without the HWY 29 crowd driving up the prices & the noise.

The grounds are nice, but not spectacular. The small pond, frequently patroled by live-in black and white swans, is a nice feature. The pool is small and crowded. The atrium appears circa 1975, with outdated carpet and furnishings. Same with the rooms. The living room furniture must've come from the rent-to-own-collection - similar to what one may see in a \"Roseanne\" rerun or a trailor park in Arkansas. We were not impressed. The room felt dark, musty, and cold. The breakfasts were good - we really enjoyed the made-to-order omelettes and french toast. The afternoon snacks and wine were pretty nasty - not what you'd expect for $300/night close to wine country. More of what you'd expect on a red eye flight. The wine wasn't really drinkable.

The rooms that had beige shutters had lcd tv\u2019s in the bedrooms but older crt models in the living space.

The kitchen (or whatever you want to call it) had a 1990's vintage microwave and mini frig. None of the phones in the room worked. Aside from the conditon of the interior of the room we had one other issue: The front door of the first suite we were given had an almost 1 \" gap between the door and door frame at the bottom of the door. Seeing as the front door was an exterior (picture old 1960's Holiday Inn style) door --this is not good. Besides letting in light just about any bug you could name could have come in the room and this is exactly what happened. We noticed this and were given another suite--which I noticed was only slighly better with a 1/4\" gap at the bottom of the door. If you need to do any work forget it unless your laptop battery is fully charged. There were no desks, just a table in the front room, but with no available plugs to use at the table.

In all my years of being a Hilton Honors VIP, I have never been asked to wait, but decided to wait patiently because Ryan said we would have a really nice room.

The beds themselves were comfy enough - but anything would have worked for me after supervising a group of college students at the conference. I only had 2 negative comments: When I walked by the ponds (where the geese & ducks were), there was a terrible sewage-type smell, which disappeared once you went into the buildings. The other bad thing was a loud security alarm (not sure where it was coming from) going off for more than an hour. I wasn't sure if it was on the property or across the street. I just wished someone would have found it earlier to turn it off! I guess this showed how thin the walls were - I could also hear street traffic throughout the night. You should request a room further away from the street and on an upper floor. Breakfast was plentiful, with made to order omelettes, bacon, sausage, pancakes, oatmeal plus other items like bagels, cereal, fruit, etc. Like other reviewers have said, the location is great - right off the freeway & within 2 minutes of the Napa outlets.

We went day after xmas 2007 - family of 5, my wife, sons age 10,8 and 5. We had a wonderful time. Here are my tips: 1. The morning breakfast was great - make sure you eat before 830am or it's a cattle call situation. 2. The kids really loved the indoor pool - great size and the jacuzzi was nice - well lit so you feel energized. 3. Manager's reception - great - you can get drink after drink - all complimentary alcohol, soda, everything. 4. Rooms were excellent - lots of space, nice fridge, sink and microwave, good bathroom - excellent cleaning persons - we tipped them they were so good - Flatscreen TV and tv in back room. 5. Peaceful scenery with the atrium, and courtyard garden and geese. The atrium also has a nice bar and social room - lot of parties were going on there. 6. For outings I recommend going to: -Copia (great for kids, nice museum and they took you on tour - only cost $5 per adult, children free) -Sweetie Pie's and General store in Downtown Napa - nice location and right on the river - great friendly service and good prices. -for elegant night dinner - Giovanni's was really good - should call for reservation as it seemed really crowded. -Loved Cakebread Winery - Friendly people and wine tasting only $10 per adult - nice tour as well. - Playground Fantastico - right across the hotel on other side of freeway - kids loved it - really big and modern playground. - Premium outlets - great stores my wife stayed 3 hours at a time for 2 days shopping there! -Dean and Deluica - wife loved the baguettes there. 7. I would not recommend: - Visatui Winery - people not friendly at all - no tour and the hype does not match the experience. - hwy 29 very dangerous road, hard to cross, no stop signs or lights and many cars - very difficult to change directions on the road- have to wait and then really make your move sometimes. - did not like parts of downtown napa like 3rd street - homeless people and little bit defense antenna went up there waiting for burgers at Nations - the burgers were good though! overall great vacation and kids loved it too.....embassy suites had a lot of people there - the noise of people walking up above you and on the walkways was loud but you will get your money's worth - good luck!", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Napa, California", "Title": "\u201cTypical Embassy Suites....not sure about the hype\u201d", "Author": "LQGuy", "ReviewID": "UR12057436", "Content": "After reading the many reviews here, I was expecting an extraordinary Embassy Suites property.

Small water features and animals were present. The room was simply a typical Embassy Suites room. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Nothing worse than a typical Embassy Suites...but nothing better either. The bed was okay. We both didn't sleep so great on it. But it wasn't a horrible bed. Breakfast was simply a zoo! We had to wait in line for approximately 20-25 minutes, and then there were absolutely no tables available, so we had to take it up to the room, then return for juice. Breakfast was okay...about on par with Denny's calibar food. Not horrible, but certainly not gourmet. Again...typical Embassy Suites. Would I return to this hotel...probably!

All was good. We loved the lobby, get your wine at the managers reception and turn the chairs by the fire around and enjoy!! We watched the Steeler game last Monday in the bar, on really comfy couches. Almost as good as home!! What a mess the Monday night game was!! We are from Pittsburgh so guess why we picked CA for a few days?? The managers reception is nice, food got a little boring but is free(well, included in your price). Mike, who is a bartender for the 2 hours while you are there is really nice. We tipped him well and he kept the wine and drinks flowing!! You can sit inside in the Atrium but since we are from the North we enjoyed sitting outside. The did not have the Chimneas lit ,but I bet if we would of asked the would have!! We did sit at the fire, as I said above. David at the front desk was very helpful, as seen in above reviews. He helped us plan a few days and we got in all that we wanted to see. It was crazy but this was a sightseeing vacation not our usual beach vacation. What I really liked was David remembered us and what we did for the day. What a personal touch!! That made us feel special. When can you say that about a hotel?? He was great. They have comment cards and we filled one out for both Mike and Dave, I hope they got them. Dave, if you are reading this after we told you about this web site please accept our thanks. We were told to go to Bogeta Bay by Mike. What a beautiful drive through wine country. Carols Pizza Shack was recomended if you are staying in. It was really good. Route 1 was beautiful but were are the guard rails???? I was totally freaked out. Now I know what \"breathtaking\" scenery really is!!!! Fishermans Warlf was okay if you like the tourist thing. We didnt. My husband is still complaining about the $7.50 ice cream at the chocolate place, not worth the price. Did the wine train, wonderful!!! We did the lunch beacause the Moon light dinner we first booked was not full. I would recomend doing dinner if you want a more romantic setting. Lunch was romantic but if we go back I would do dinner. I hope this helps ,do it all while you are there.!! We did ,from the wineries all the way to San Fran.

Ideal if you are going with a group of friends having to share accommodations, or bringing a child. I was blown away by the swans, flower gardens, indoor/outdoor pools, huge bar, restaurant, lots of meeting space. Plus, we recieved a rennovated room which meant all up to date furnishings (pretty mod) and flat screen. Because I am a Hilton Honors Gold, they gave us a bottle of good wine. Plus, there were extra little perks like actual coffee beans and grinder! This is an idea I can't believe more hotels dont use! I am a coffee snob, so it was wonderful. Other little amenities were shoe shine kit, bath salts, teas, hot chocolate, popcorn, it was very nice.

We were on the first floor, a major mistake on our part, but we were with two other couples and in the midst of fun, so who cared, right? Well, at about 6 a.m. our first morning there, we cared, A LOT! As did our friends who had the same experiences in their rooms. The people above us tromped back and forth, rather loudly, for two hours. Just as you fell back to sleep, the creaking floorboard above our bed would scare the heck out of you and set you upright! And everytime they flushed or washed or showered, it sounded like a waterfall was coming down in us. Not nice. After they left, we were calmed by the humming of the maid vacuuming their room! HAHAHAHA This happened both mornings, but it was relatively minor all things considered. But seriously, aside from the two hours in the mornings and the hour or so at night when the elephants above us were active, the hotel was great. The \"free\" cooked to order breakfast was amazingly good with coffee, juices, tea, bagels, toast, yogurt, fruit, pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon, etc. All for the taking. We took it all back to our room rather than sit in the atrium and enjoyed our \"free\" USA Today paper in private. In the evening, the \"free\" wine, beer, sodas and mixed drinks were an even greater plus, although more booze after a day of wine-tasting was a bit tough and honestly, I could not see getting the best of the Embassy Suites on that deal!! The room was pretty clean and I am a clean freak. The only other complaints, aside from the herd of elephants, was the fact that the two TV remotes did not work and the shower was a light mist. If you are into people spitting on you, then you will be a happy camper. But for what we paid, I was quite happy! Easy to get to, right off the 29 freeway (we backed up to it but heard very lttle to no noise) and close to both St Helena Hwy (the 29) and the Silverado Trail.

The doors wouldn't close or open easily and the noise in doing so was not befitting a hotel of this caliber. I realize that the room layouts prevented the use of full size swing out doors but some other door design (pocket door?) could have been used. When you pay the rates they charge, you feel a better design effort could have been made on their part.", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ORANGE COUNTY, CA", "Title": "\u201cFreeway Noise Suites!\u201d", "Author": "ROSEOC", "ReviewID": "UR7769742", "Content": "They should name this hotel Freeway Noise Suites instead of Embassy Suites.

We really enjoyed our stay at the Embassy Suites. I did tons of research on Napa/Sonoma hotels and felt pretty good before I left. Feel confident this hotel will not let you down. Typical to Better Embassy Suite rooms. Fantastic Service, friendly front desk and bar staff. Great courtyard with real swans! Breakfast served daily as well as the Manager's Cocktail hour (get their Sangria). Lots of variety on both. We paid 264.00 a night, avg for Napa. I travel quite a bit with work and stay at 4 and 5 star properties, so I am picky. I would give this property a solid 3.5 almost a 4. Quiet, clean, great atmosphere and close to downtown Napa and central to visiting alot of the wineries. Speaking of wineries: We suggest going to: Artesa (wines so so, but the view is the best in Napa), Domain Carnaros( we joined their wine club-great terrace where you overlook Carneros region, sipping champagne and having a cheese tray), Sequoia Grove (small boutique, awesome wines and a warm/fuzzy feel, and Cakebread (their wines-need I say more. Their Tour was great, you got to keep you glass, sample 5 wines and a tour for 10.00 a person). Did a private tour and tasting at Seduction Winery-(small boutique feel and just loved it), Monticello was nice and small feel. Did not care for: Hall or St Supery. We did about 10 wineries in 4 days. I highly reccommend not going to the Mondavi's/Beringers..think small boutique and you will enjoy it more. I also reccommend getting the COPIA passport for 5.00 on line. We had tons of two for one tasting coupons which my Husband was thrilled with. That passport saved us over 100.00! We also went to Muir Woods and San Fran for lunch on Memorial Day-broke up all the wine were consuming. We had a convertible so we enjoyed driving around the.

We were visiting Napa and then on our way to San Francisco. We arrived around midnight. The lobby was very pretty and grand looking. It was a large room with a fireplace and lots of chairs, internet access, a kiosk to print out airplane tickets, water and coffee and the front desk. Checking in was a breeze. The front desk person was very nice. The lobby is indoors but the hallways to the rooms are outdoors. They have a cover so you wouldn't get rained on. I have kind of made it a rule not to stay anywhere with outside hallways because in my experience, they are usually skanky and shady places but I took a chance because this place looked nice and was a GREAT price to stay in Napa. We took the elevator to the 2nd floor and it was confusing signage to find our room. The room was awesome. It was beautiful and very big. There was a living room and bar when you walked in. It was very homey. A couch, a tv, chairs, a kitchen table, a coffee table, and the bar with stools. There are lots of books about the local wineries, how much tastings are, restaurants, things to do, etc. The bathroom was also very nice (the usual marble with the shower and curved shower curtain for more room). The doors were weird though. It was two little skinny doors that closed together (but opened separately) and one was on a hinge so the doors couldn't stay open. They automatically closed. No big deal, just weird and annoying. The bedroom had a sink and mirror (convenient to get make up on when someone is in the bathroom). There was a king bed and a TV and end tables. The bed was VERY comfortable and there were sound machine alarm clocks that could wake you up by your MP3 player or sounds (like the ocean, the rain, etc) or the alarm noise or radio. I believe the bedroom was facing the highway ramp but I didn't not hear anything from the highway at all. The room was very quiet. I did not hear anyone that night or the next day. The living room faced the courtyard which was really pretty. There was an outdoor pool, a pond with swans and tables and chairs, a gazebo and a little mill. The next morning we went to the free deluxe hot breakfast that was included. I was so impressed. It was in a nice restaurant part and there was lots of drinks (juices, coffee, milk, water, etc), cold food (cereal, fruit, danishes, bagels, bread, etc), a omelet making station (lots of options, made to order, bacon, sausage, potatoes), pancakes, waffles. Maybe more but I didn't notice. The omelet was very good. The potatoes weren't that great but they were free so who cares? It was a very good breakfast for free. It was a good breakfast for money. It was the same thing you would get at any breakfast restaurant. I don't think you could go back for more omelets, bacon or sausage (though they probably wouldn't care) but the rest of the food was like a buffet. There was also an indoor pool and spa that looked nice. The free internet in the lobby was available when we arrived at midnight but checking out on a Friday morning around 11, there was basically a line for it. One guy would NOT get off even though people were waiting. I also heard the airline ticket kiosk thing was not working. Checkout was also easy. You can check out from your room or at the front desk and there weren't any people at the desk waiting. The front desk people were very polite giving us winery maps and two \"buy one, get one free\" tasting coupons at two wineries. Ask for those. Napa charges at almost every winery for tastings and it is between $5 and $30 (except fancy special reserve tastings). Most places were $10 for a 4 tastings. The hotel was in a good location. Right in downtown Napa and there are wineries everywhere though the bigger ones are probably 15 minutes away. TIP: GO TO THE NAPA VISITORS CENTER. There was a man there selling resort condos who gave us a tasting card for free tastings at like 10 wineries. He didn't even force a sales pitch. He asked how long we'd be there and if we had time to look at the condos, we'd get a $100 restaurant gift card for Napa OR San Fran. It actually seemed reasonable but we said we would only be there until 5 PM and that was it. No pressure at all from him. He was very nice. Plus, we got maps and recommendations for wineries and places to eat. It was well worth it. Napa is not as nice as Sonoma in my opinion. Much more built up (even in the wineries section). Not as much individual service at the tastings. Sonoma had all free tastings pretty much except reserve wines and most places gave us those for free too. They were a little friendlier in Sonoma. Sonoma was also much prettier and picturesque like you'd picture in the movies or on a postcard. Now, Napa was very nice but I'd head to Sonoma if you have the time. I am saying Napa but I mean Napa Valley (St Helena, Rutherford, etc). They are all next to each other. One place we did not like was V. Sattui Winery. They are one of the only free tasting places and it shows. It was SO crowded that they wouldn't even serve us. They have specific sections to be served (certain parts of the bar, they literally just ignore you. Literally. There were lots of angry people trying to talk to someone). When they do serve you, they are rushed and rude, they don't give you any time. There is barely room to move. On the bright side, they have good wine and they have a deli/market section with GREAT food. That is part of the reason they are so popular. The food is so good and there are tables to eat at outside. Go for the food, go elsewhere for tastings. In summation, the hotel was great. I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "April 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland", "Title": "\u201cNice Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "rubhed", "ReviewID": "UR7166732", "Content": "Good Evening, I would like to start this review with my first impression. The entrance is very nice rustic napa. The staff is friendly but not much beyond that. The grounds are pretty. The ponds with the swans, ducks and turtles was fantastic. The rooms are the same size whether you get the standard or the executive. The hotel is right next to the freeway so if you want a standard queen room they are all facing the freeway. Twins and executive rooms are on the other side of the property. If you don't like freeway noice i suggest you either upgrade or ask for a twin room away from the freeway. The rooms are kind of odd shaped, but they ok. The pictures included are from the executive room. The managers receprion is nice, bu they use cheap booze and the food is just chips celery dip. It is free and free is good. Hint : They have Jim Beam. It is the only name brand alcohol they have. Again it's free and free is good :). The breakfast is nice. The trick is to get to breakfast early. I think it starts at 7:30am. It is made to order and the omlets are great. The staff lights the fireplaces in the morning so you can sit by a noce fire while eating breakfast. One problem i found is that the walls are kind of thin and you can hear people sometimes walking above you. This is very minor compared to the freeway. :).

I don't usually complain much but there was just too many disappointments. My husband and I drove over to Napa for the weekend to celebrate my 50th BD. I was surprised to drive up and find no overhang/awning to park under (it was pouring down rain). Also, there is no one to help with baggage or even a restroom in the lobby. After we checked in we were told to drive around to the back of the complex and find one of 3 entrances with awnings the get you into the building. There is absolutely no signage outside of the doors and it was difficult to find our room once we got inside (no signs with room numbers and arrows directing you). Once inside, the very dark room had a very strong mildew smell but after driving for 3 hours in the rain and struggling with luggage, finding the room, etc. I didn't have the energy to ask for and move to another room. The room was also warm and stuffy with no A/C to cool it off. We opened the window but then heard the very close highway noise.

The hair dryer is placed in a fancy black bag with a tied rope around it which sits high on a stand on the bathroom counter. At least on Sunday (when I got nosy and looked in the bag) I got to dry my hair. Saturday morning I received an in-room massage that my daughter had scheduled for me. She told me that she had pre-paid for it and that I should just pay the tip just in case it wasn't up to par. When we received our bill a charge ($90) for the massage had been added. I called the spa and the very nice lady said she'd call the front desk, take care of it and call me right back in which she did. I thought the $90 charge was odd since the massage therapist didn't have me sign anything for payment, meaning she already knew it was paid for.

We were there while they were remodeling but stayed in the back, it seemed at the time that the rooms at the front of the hotel were being remodeled, but there were lots of dumpsters around, furniture being moved in and out, etc. Didn't bother us during the stay but definitely noticed it when outside the hotel, coming and going. Sorry to see that we just missed a renovated room, it did seem a bit dated but clean and spacious enough. My biggest complaint is the indoor pool. The tile, while beautiful, stays very wet and very slippery. I had a vice grip on my two-year-old's hand the entire time he was out and he slipped on almost every step he took. My six-year-old, entering the pool area carefully with athletic shoes on, slipped and fell right before I said \"be very careful, the tile is slippery.\" Luckily he fell well and wasn't hurt but it is shocking to me that they haven't corrected this problem with better surfacing. Young, old and in-between could be seriously hurt and they could face lawsuits on a regular basis. This must be fixed. The breakfast, while free, reminded me of a cafeteria or dorm, it wasn't that great. But there were lots of choices and it was nice to serve ourselves and be done with breakfast quickly with two little kids ready to start their day and not sit still for long. The atrium is a nice setting for a quick bite with kids, a group of travellers, or for a business traveller. The hotel sits right on Highway 29 and in fact our room faced the back of the property and the highway, however, the noise wasn't bad. Just be aware of this if that view would bother you to be sure to upgrade to something with a different view. The price was right for us and we weren't there for the ambiance. I would not recommend this as a romantic hotel for couples travelling in wine country. There surely are more attractive options. From the outside it is a nice looking hotel, and the inner courtyard is quite pretty and the swans in the \"old mill\" area are fun to watch. The \"vibe\" however is not very interesting otherwise.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGood Napa location\u201d", "Author": "Existent", "ReviewID": "UR5577186", "Content": "Best hotel in Napa by far.

Pulling into the hotel had to park way in the back because it was so full. Kind of seedy and had construction workers staring out some of the windows at us. We had so much wine and stuff in our car I did not feel secure at all and moved it as soon as I could get a space in the front of the hotel. When checking in discovered the front desk clerk was brand new and took awhile to check us in. The hotel had construction workers everywhere which made my 21 year daughter uncomfortable. Only one elevator working and it was always full of construction workers and materials and a huge mess. When we get to our room the key does not work. I have to go through the whole waiting 5 minutes on the elevator, etc and go back down to the font desk where the kid gets me new keys. When we finally get in to the room it was newly decorated and spacious. We use the toilet and it starts overflowing all over the floor for no reason. So we have to move to another room, back down to the front desk...new set of keys again. Rough start but now for the good stuff. Great breakfast served in the atrium. Grounds were nice, location was close to downtown Napa and easy to get to. But by far the best thing was the MASSAGES in room. I had booked online on the hotels website. Both my daughter and I thought the girls who did them were the best we have ever had. I had the Down Under which was alot of feet and calves, also neck and shoulder and my daughter had a deep tissue Swedish massage. I wish I could remember their names to refer by name. On our trip to California we first stayed at the Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay and the Inn of the Spanish Garden in Santa Barbara which were both 5 star excellent hotels so compared to those this hotel was just OK but I would recommend if you are going to Napa and I would probably stay there again since the construction would be done.

I booked a little late, so there was not much else available - but because Embassy Suites has a fairly good reputation, I decided to try it. We were VERY disappointed. The only good thing I can say is that the lobby is nice and they had excellent customer service. The Manager was very apologetic and tried to make us comfortable. Our first room smelled very bad and did not have a good view - was on the ground floor. The smell was hard to describe - it was a musty/moldy/wet dog-that-had-tried-to-be-masked-by-cleaning-products-kind-of-smell. Very nasty. We asked to be moved, and were put into an upstairs room with an even worse view. This room smelled equally as bad, we finally gave up and opened up the door in the \"living room\" and the sliding glass door in the bedroom for a few hours to air it out. The \"suite\" was very small and dark and the bedroom side was located right next to the freeway. The bed, along with the rest of the furniture, was very hard and uncomfortable - we did not sleep well AT ALL. The room seemed fairly clean, but not the cleanest I've seen. The decor was very dated and worn. It was Motel-6 quality - which is fine if you booked at Motel-6 - not OK if you booked a $199/night \"Suite\". The cocktail hour was OK. They had a fairly well-stocked bar - I liked that I could order mixed drinks. The snacks consisted of a veggie tray, chips/salsa, olives and a cracker/cheese/meat tray. It was decent, but just the basics. The breakfast was OK. Everything, except for the omelets, were pre-made and kept under heating lights. The only omelet available was ham & cheese with a choice of onions, peppers and mushrooms. Bagels and toaster were available - that was nice. After the 1st night I used the computer in the lobby to book a room at the Park Hyatt in San Francisco (nothing else available in Napa area). Luckily, the Manager was very nice and let check-out after only one night, despite the 2 night minimum. He also reduced the price from $199 to $149. He was extremely nice and helpful - even gave us directions to San Francisco via the Golden Gate Bridge. As a side note - had a wonderful time in SF. The Park Hyatt was very nice, excellent staff and good location. Also, the city was practically empty for Memorial Weekend, which we very much enjoyed. They also had great rates at most of the nicest hotels there. We paid $179 for a very nice room with a beautiful view. The only downside is that parking was $40 plus tax.
