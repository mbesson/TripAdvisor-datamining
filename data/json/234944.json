The hotel is just off Nollendorfplatz so the U bahn station is just 100m away giving you great transport links - lines U1 U2 U3 & U4. Its is so easy to get to the centre and all the main attractions there. The room was functional - very clean, comfortable bed, separate shower room and in-room safe separate seating and work desk area - there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. really pleasing is that this is NOT a noisy hotel which allows you to sleep in a little if you need. My room was at the back of the hotel. I didn't use the WiFi as I made use of the hotel Web access which I found to be always available. The breakfast times are quite rigid so if needs be there is a cafe right opposite where you can fill up. If you need a restaurant near the hotel you just need to walk around the corner on to Maassenstrasse - there is a huge selection of restaurants all the way up to Winterfeldplatz. There is also a huge selection of bars on your doorstep. If you require a supermarket - the is a Kaiser's on Nollendorfplatz. The location of the hotel makes it an easy walk up to the \"must visit\" KaDeWe and on to the Kudamm - the famous shopping area. If you want a bus tour these can be picked up on Tauentzienstrasse (outside KaDe We). Taking everything into account - price, location, quality of the room - I found this hotel to be an ideal choice for my visit to Berlin.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kathmandu, Nepal", "Title": "\u201cHotel with basic amenities but closer to U bahn station\u201d", "Author": "ckanchan", "ReviewID": "UR119150006", "Content": "I selected this hotel for the wi-fi facility and due to proximity from the U bahn station during my three days trip to Berlin. No doubt this hotel is stone throw away from Nollendorfplatz station. However, my disappointment was that wi-fi in the room was not working. I was assured that it will be fixed next day, however, it was not fixed. Later I came to know that other guests too could not avail internet facility in the room. I had to come to lobby for accessing internet, where it was working. The room was neat, clean and tidy. Every day, room would be cleaned without having to request for clean up, which I like in the hotel. The room was small but enough for me but not bathroom. I wish bathroom could be bigger. The breakfast was not included in the room rate. Buffet breakfast served in the ground floor was too basic. Morning and day staffs were pleasant, friendly and spoke fluent English. However, staff during night was not able to communicate good English. Not fault of this hotel, but due to mistake of my booking agent, I had considerable difficulty in finding this hotel as I was searching this hotel in some other district (Neukolln) as this was what written in the hotel voucher. I had difficulty talking over the phone with the night staff due to his poor English skill.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Clean, Central\u201d", "Author": "MrFishwick", "ReviewID": "UR118354318", "Content": "Great central location (nollendorf platz) and easy to get around berlin.

Overall, our experience in the hotel was quite poor. First, the decor in the rooms is quite dated and unconsciously kitschy. Although the rooms are clean, they are in need of redecorating! The worst thing in the hotel was definitely the Wifi connection. It was totally unreliable, slow, inconsistent, and allowed access to some web sites and not to others! In this day and age, a hotel should provide this service at a higher level for its guests. The staff at the hotel were also quite lukewarm and unfriendly. As English-speaking tourists, we felt somewhat unwelcome in the hotel. The hotel also has a policy of taking your key every time you leave. A few times when we came back late from the bars, we felt that the staff were giving us dirty looks. Since the hotel is located on a gay street in Berlin, this was a little surprising! Finally, the check-out at the hotel was 10:00 a.m. Having travelled extensively, we have never heard of such an early check-out! The woman at the desk did, however, let us check out at 10:30 a.m., and she also kept our bags for a few hours. Overall though, they should allow guests to leave closer to noon. All in all, there are better hotels in the area, so shop around!", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean,and good value, in the right location\u201d", "Author": "PaulofLiverpool", "ReviewID": "UR110599625", "Content": "Because we were going to a birthday party, just round the corner, this hotel ticked all the boxes.

Close by there are lot a good cafes and bars, so if you didn't feel like breakfast in the hotel, then for around 6 euros, you can a good breakfst elsewhere.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The Sachsenhof is a spacious, rambling, quiet hotel, fronting on Motzstra\u00dfe and arranged around an inner courtyard of traditional Berlin apartment style buildings. It has no airs or graces. What you see is what you get. The hotel seems very well maintained. Our room appeared to have been recently refurbished, with new functional furniture, carpet and d\u00e9cor. It was a generous size with a high ceiling and a large window opening onto the courtyard giving plenty of light and fresh air. There was a seating area with table and comfy chairs and a new flat panel TV (remote available from reception with 5\u20ac deposit). It would have been good to have had a kettle and mugs in the room \u2013 although there are plenty of cafes nearby, so their absence was not a problem. The room had a small safe (not quite big enough for a laptop). There was no internet in-room, but a free fast public walk-up terminal (no chair to sit at as you browse) is available on the ground floor near reception, and handy if you\u2019re just checking mail on the go. The compact en suite bathroom was stylishly done with an attractive contemporary finish and decent quality fittings. There was plenty of hot water and all the plumbing worked as it should. Heating in the room worked well, was quiet and controllable. Housekeeping was discreet and efficient, with overall cleanliness very good. Front of house day reception staff were professional, friendly and efficient. The night reception staff will let you back in when you ring the bell, as your room key has to be left at reception when you go out. Breakfast starts early and finishes at 10 \u2013 which can be limiting if you\u2019ve been enjoying the typically late Berlin nightlife. We didn\u2019t catch breakfast on this trip so can\u2019t comment directly, although we heard from others that it\u2019s ok and worth the 6\u20ac additional charge. With affordable rates, well kept decent spec rooms and a great location in the heart of Schoneberg, you couldn\u2019t go wrong with the Sachsenhof.
