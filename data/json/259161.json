It's a neat boutique hotel in the heart of Zona Rosa on Londres street. Extrtemely convenient location, plenty of restaurants, nightlife, all just a stroll away. It is also very safe, police is always around. If you stay in Mexico city and are willing to pay for a moderately priced hotel, this is great. We were staying at the Fiesta Americana Reforma, which has a plush lobby and 3/4 restaurants but rooms are smaller and older, also nothing can beat a zona rosa location. My nine year old was travelling with us so having all the fast food joints nearby helped, so did the location of pharmacies for water, snacks etc. The frontdesk and other people in the hotel were very friendly and helpful, never charged money for local calls. They also kept most of our luggage securely while we travelled to other parts of Mexico. Roberto at the front desk, Christian, Guillermo, Roberto the bellmen, great people. They arranged tours ( go mexitours/greyline ask for Issac the tour guide, dont use Estur the other more popular tour company) private taxis, tickets for travel, everything, all our valuables were secure in their safes at the front desk. Never faced any crimes or theft, nice area, good hotel. There is just one restaurant, but you can step out and find thousands including starbucks and sanborns for breakfast and quick snacks. The hotel is all suites with a living room and also a pull out couch. Cleanliness could have been better but so many positives and a $106 price tag makes it worth your while. Try the restaurant Konditori for breakfast or coffee, fantastic baked goods and cakes, also try Michelad,a beer cocktail that I never tasted before. I loved the city and its people and didnt think that pollution was such a big deal as we are led to believe in the states.", "Date": "Aug 30, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR298638403", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sara95"}, {"Content": "bon repport prix-qualit\u8305   showReview(11421346, 'full');", "Date": "May 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR627182149", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d259161-r4825200-Fiesta_Americana_Suites_Zona_Rosa-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "259161", "Price": "$107"}}
