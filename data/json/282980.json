If you have deep pockets, you can enjoy unbeatable quality. If you are on a tight budget, you will get what even cheap hotels in the Third World are ashamed to offer. I read that Seiler offered good value for money. Whoever came up with that has a very strange concept of good value. Seiler charges exorbitant prices for what it offers: officially 137 EUR per night for a room for two adults and a child. To top it off, as we checked out we were asked to pay another 6 EUR for each night that we had stayed - a so-called city tourist tax. So, what did we get for 146 EUR a night? A great location, to be sure. Seiler is within walking distance from most of the greatest sites in Rome. The beds were clean and comfortable (However, Americans may not agree with me as they have a different notion of a comfortable bed. I have read lots of American complaints about \"hard beds\" in hotels where I slept comfortably). There was hot water. There was toilet paper. The elevator worked. And that was it. Instead of towels, we got something like bed sheets. They changed them every other day or so. The bed linen was not changed even once although we stayed seven nights. The walls were moldy and stained. The wardrobe was full of a foul stench. The bathroom stank even worse, like a dead dog in the middle of August (Readers from countries with street dogs know what I am talking about). The shower cabin panel was broken and the bathroom flooded after each shower. The showerhead was broken and could not be hanged, so we had to hold it in one hand while showering. In the shower cabin, there was no place to leave the soap or the sponge: they had to be held in the other hand. The TV remote control did not work: judging from other reviews, this is typical of Seiler. They just can't be bothered to buy new batteries. The blow dryer was out of order but we managed to fix it. Yet, the worse thing was the walls. They seemed to be made of some kind of cardboard. So, when you neighbor flushes the bathroom in the middle of the night, it is as if somebody is doing that right in the middle of your room. If you understand your neighbors' language, you can follow their conversation. We had quiet neighbors the first six nights, except for the flushing that occurred at most improbably hours at night. The seventh night, we had a family with hysterical kids that would not go to bed until midnight. Breakfast consists more or less of good quality stuff but strictly rationed, except for the cornflakes. You get a small croissant, a small bun, two small crackers, and tiny servings of honey, jam, chocolate paste, and butter. More or less filling if you can eat this kind of food. They serve tea (real English tea, I think it was Pickwick) or coffee (also real and strong, not the diluted version you get in the US) or hot chocolate. Every morning, there was a puddle of water at the entrance to the dining hall: at Seiler the concept of washing does not include mopping up the floor. I guess if you slip and fall it will be your fault. So, here is the final verdict. If you absolutely insist on staying in the center of Rome but cannot afford anything decent, stay at Seiler or a similarly priced hotel. But be ready for hardships that you will not endure even in cheap hotels in Asia or Eastern Europe, where I come from. An absolute disgrace for Italian tourism and the authorities that supervise it.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cClean but Basic Amenities\u201d", "Author": "Brian P", "ReviewID": "UR127828699", "Content": "This hotel was well situated for transport links, Reception staff very pleasant.

Also the breakfast area was in the basement next to a room containing a water heater that was leaking a spilling water all over the slippery tilled floor in the entire breakfast area.

The hotel location is good. If you do not have too much luggage you can walk the 6 or so city blocks from Termini (15 -20 minutes) or to go by taxi (5 minutes). From the airport a taxi takes about half an hour, we paid EUR 47 for the ride. The hotel is in a side street with little traffic or noise, and it feels all secure also at late night. There are dozens of smallish hotels in the same overall area. In case of Seiler you will not find any big hotel sign outside, so you shall have to find the street, the building number, locate a a smallish sign in the wall, push the button to get the solid wooden door opened, walk in the corridor, turn left, up the stairs, and there it is. You have several restaurants close by (I was surprised how expensive Rome is), and a working ATM money dispenser 5-10 min walk away (down the street, turn left at Via Nazionale, one block towards the Plaza, in the corner), and the Repubblica metro station is only in 10 min walking distance, very convenient. We took a 4 euros x person full day metro ticket, very convenient and economic way to travel in Rome. The hotel has no city maps, you better take yours. The hotel is tiny, the rooms very basic but more or less workable. The hotel has a wireless internet connection, which did not work in our room (neither at the reception) so you may not trust in it. The room did not have reading lamps, so if you like to read something at night it will strain your eyes. A smallish flat screen TV with Italian only channels. We did not have an air conditioning (a huge propeller in the roof), so I wounder how one could survive in a mid summer heat. A very basic continental breakfast which may get the eyes open (the coffee was good and strong) but does not feed you much. Us who live in an earthquake zone and are sensitive to sudden vibration may wake up early in the morning when the first passing underground metro trains shake the buildings. The staff was friendly enough and showed places, explained routes, called taxis (which come quickly) and so on. I think the price/quality relation is good if you are looking for a place to sleep in Rome, and I can't say that the neighboring two stars would be better or worse. Next time in Rome I will probably choose another hotel, to have a bit more comfort and in summer I would definitively wish to have an air conditioning .", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cJust great!\u201d", "Author": "Camelutza1", "ReviewID": "UR119477844", "Content": "I've just came back from Rome!I've stayed at Seiler hotel for 6 nights!it was just great!The hotel is close to Termini station!we dropped off the airport bus at Termini and in 10 minutes walking we were at the hotel!The hotel is also 2 minutes walking distance from the metro stop- Piazza de la Republica!From this metro station there is 1 stop to Fontana di Trevi, 2 stops until Piazza di Spagna and 5 stops until Vaticano!We used the metro just when we went to Vaticano but for the others touristic points we went on foot because everything was very close to the hotel!The room was small and very clean and the space was enough for 2 persons,the toilet was clean, towels were changed every day!The hotel is great for the price we paid especially because when you get out of the hotel you are in the center of Rome,1 minute to Via Nazionale close to shops and restaurants!The breakfast is very simple but enough to get the strenght to walk all day long on the streets of Rome:croissants, honey, butter, jam adn chocolate cream,coffee, juice, milk with cereals!Even if it's a 2 stars hotel i recommend it 100% because of the location and the price that you pay for!", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWas fine!!\u201d", "Author": "Tan-maintainer99", "ReviewID": "UR116524522", "Content": "Stayed here for a week in February, and I found it basic but clean.

When searching for a hotel I was looking for something in a good location and a good price. We also needed parking as we were driving down from northern Italy. Very hard to find in Rome. Upon arriving we had a bit of an issue parking my big ol' American car. The spot they had was not big enough. The gentleman at the desk was able to recommend a parking garage literally around the corner which worked out fine. The rooms were typical European hotel rooms. Scuffed walls, run-down appearance, little furniture, and few of the comforts Americans are used to. TV's did not work, but we weren't in Rome to watch TV. No A/C, but we did have a fan without a cover (we traded with my aunt who had a fan with a cover in her room). Our room had carpet, my aunt's did not. My aunt's room also had a high cabinet with blankets spilling out of it. She couldn't get them back in to close the door. Breakfast was very basic-breads, rolls, croissants, jellys, nutella, cereal, milk, coffee, juice. The best part of the hotel was the service. Our beds were made and carpet vacuumed daily. The gentleman at the desk was fantastic at giving us advice on how to get around, and what to do. On his recommendation we booked a guided tour of the Vatican-so worth it. The Vatican is far away from the other sites, and can be very crowed and confusing to buy tickets. With the tour we didn't have to worry about any of that and saw all the highlights-Sistine Chapel, Tombs of the Popes, Saint Peter's Basilica, and St. Peter's Square. Although the hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to the majority of the sights, we also booked the hop-on, hop off bus on his recommendation. The only reason we did this is because of having the 5 kids and their ages. He also gave us a map of the city and told us some basics of Rome. While checking in things were taking awhile and he apologized and explained he was rearranging our room assignments. Originally our rooms were not close together, but he said with all the kids he thought it would be better if we were close. So, not only did he put us in rooms that were closer together but one of the rooms was also larger then what we booked at no extra charge. All of the staff-reception desk, and the ladies who served breakfast were extremely nice and helpful.

Is there plenty of hot water and fluffy towels in the closet sized bathrooms? \"Si\". Are they luxury suites -- suitable for entertaining or for practicing your kungfu, martial arts, or ballroom dancing steps? \"Definitely not.\" These are TOURIST CLASS rooms. You get what you pay for. if you want a larger room, book at any one of the nearby American style hotel brands. You'll get a larger room, you'll get your ham and eggs, and you will be presented with a much larger bill. We felt that the Seiler Hotel had an old-world ambience, splendid architectural details, charming courtyards, quaint views of the backs of nearby buildings in their terra cotta and other earth tones and shutters, breathtaking staircases, and friendly, multi-lingual staff. There was an elevator, suitable for one person with luggage, or two to three well acquainted persons without baggage. Togetherness is the key word for this elevator. It worked perfectly. The breakfast offered was perfectly adeqaute, if not large. I read that Italians don't eat much of a colazione (breakfast), but compensate at pranzo (lunch or dinner). The thing is, people must READ before they travel, so they know what to expect. I enjoyed my honey and Nutella with crusty rolls and croissants. I found the coffee deliciously strong, Fruit juices were available, and frankly-- this hotel, and breakfast, was everything I had come to expect. We have stayed in tiny rooms in London, and Paris, Florence, Venice, and New York City, and we know that you get what you pay for. If a hotel room is clean and comfortable, that's all we want. We like to spend our money on other things when travelling, such as opera tickets or spectacular meals.

Try calling the front desk from your room there was never any answer. Get dressed and go down there and there is always someone complaining about something. The manager of this hotel was the most inconsiderate and rudiest person I have ever come across in a business that caters to guests. I consistently went down to his desk and requested a room that had some air conditioner, due to the fact that my husband has had a heart attack and hypertension among other health related issue and this condition was not fit for him, although one of his employee was very compassionate and requested that the manager help us out, he refused to. Needless to say we left for Florence at of three days and by the time we got there my husband had to be seen emergently for exhaustion due to the heat and ultimately sleep deprivation.
