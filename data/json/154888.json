It's within walking distance of lots of good spots and is in an area with lots of food options. There are some prostitutes in nearby streets, but they're harmless. The room we had was pretty plain - just two beds, a tv, cabinet and bathroom, but it was sufficient for our needs. The bathroom is pretty simple as well. In our experience the internet only works in the lobby. We could not connect in the room at all. One real issue we had was the outsourced laundry facilities that they leave a brochure for in the rooms. We handed over a bag of clothes and got them back all nicely folded, but with a $75 bill. The manager said they would stop using that facility after our experience, so I hope that has occurred. The staff were helpful though (apart from when the night receptionist was talking on the phone for ages) and did speak English. It seems to be a popular place - walk ins were turned away when I was sitting in the lobby at night - and definitely serves its purpose as a reasonable place to stay for people on a budget. It's only an average hotel, but it's priced accordingly.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay in the center of Mexico city\u201d", "Author": "Vienine Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR116931153", "Content": "Coming from Austria we stayed one night at arrival in Mexico and three nights before leaving the country.

I couldn't get the shower to work and feeling like a loon had to ask the bellboy who just held up the metal knob and water flowed.

I should have walked out then, but the manager assured me that the Marine was there just to provide extra security for hotel guests. I didn't think much about it, as I was knew to Mexico City at the time, and checked in. Ater checking in, I saw 4-6 Marines walking around the hotel at all hours, and the occasional police officer. The Marines all carry machine guns. As I chatted with my wife in the lobby, one lazily sat across from me, drapping his gun across his lap...pointed directly at me. I'm sure the safety was on, but it is a little unnerving. Finally I found out what is going on: The New York Hotel has a deal with the government to periodically hold high level drug traffikers and kidnappers on their top floor, awaiting trial. It is a semi-prison. I think the ones they have are waiting to testify, and so the Marines are their to make sure they aren't a) sprung by their mates, and b) killed by their mates they are going to testify against. People around the hotel assured me it was safe. But they can't guarantee anything.

They don't give face towels, wash cloths, bathroom mat, tissues, bottled water or hairdryers. We have found better deals for a similar price. The carpet design was horrendous, and clashed with the bedspreads and draperies. The mattress was ok, but they don't have queen or king size beds. The choice is twin or double.

Not much in the way of ambiance but very clean. I even ate in the resturant once and while I wouldn't recommend it exactly, it was fine. My one complaint is that the hotel was a bit noisy at night.
