For its class, it offers everything you need. Yes, it is no frills and you could stay somewhere much more luxurious, but I found that many of these luxury hotels were on bust streets whereas Le Relais du Louvre really is tucked away from the bustle - yet only a couple of minutes' walk from it! The Louvre museum is a stone's throw and opens late on Wednesday (and one other day - I can't remember) - the pyramid is beautiful lit up against the night sky. The Jardin des Tuileries is also close by, and children can sail little boats by a fountain (2 Euros for half an hour). A walk to Musee D'Orsay is about half an hour through the Jardin des Tuileries and across the Seine, and then a taxi to the Eiffel Tower from Musee D'Orsay costs about 7 Euros and is worth doing to save your legs. My daughter loved it all. The hotel is small but tidy and we had a lovely bathroom in room 42. Reception is manned all night so you don't have to worry about a key, and the owners/managers were very happy to help my daughter with her French. Best of all, when I managed to leave all my luggage (passports, boarding passes, laptop...) in the back of a taxi on our last day (having checked out of the hotel), it was the hotel that the taxi driver phoned when he eventually found it all in the boot of his car. The hotel immediately phoned me and liaised between a French-speaking person I accosted in Place de la Madeleine (where I happened to be) and the taxi driver (who spoke no English) to help my luggage find its way back to me. They were brilliant. The Relais de Louvre is extremely well positioned to explore the Louvre, Les Jardin Tuileries, areas of the Left Bank, Place de la Madeleine and even as far out as Musee D'Orsay and the opera house on foot. It is clean and comfortable, not frilly, and the beds are comfortable. It is also quiet, and I found that priceless, as I did the staff's attitude to my daughter; they were kind and interested and made her feel special.

It is in a prime location near the Louvre, not too far from the Pont Neuf metro station. But being off the main street means it is quiet at night and you'll still get a good sleep. I took a walk around the area that night: to the Louvre, across the Pont des Arts, to the Notre Dame, etc. It is a very lovely location in Paris, much better than when I've stayed near Gare du Nord thinking I should stay close to the station for my Eurostar trip. It is worth the small metro trip towards the Seine and stay near there instead, much nicer! The staff were lovely, certainly nothing to complain about there. They were helpful when I asked them questions, but in general I didn't need much since it was just a quick trip for work not several days holiday where I'd want to see the sights. They let me leave my bags on the second day, and use their bathroom to change when I got back, so I thought they were very accommodating -though other people may expect this from any hotel. The room was small but most hotels in Paris are, especially in this price range. I got a good enough sleep so I was happy with it. Little disappointed with the breakfast, especially with how much it cost - I would have expected more for that price.

Having researched hotels in central Paris, I thought that I would give the Le Relais du Louvre a try. From the moment that I walked in, I got such a warm and friendly greeting from the staff in reception. Everything was explained to me in great detail and I was given my keys to my room and safe. The room itself was on the smaller side (I was a single traveller therefore it really did not matter). The room was clean and tidy, as was the bathroom and there was more than enough wardrobe space. After I had unpacked I asked reception if they could call for a taxi to my concert venue (nothing was any trouble for them). Upon my late return, the friendly night porter let me in and as I don't sleep well in hotels I was ready for a sleepless night. Wrong. The double bed was so comfortable that I drifted off in minutes (the hotel is located in a very quiet street too which helps). I ordered the optional breakfast in the morning and it was more than plentiful and the croissants and pains chocolat were incredibly fresh. The location of the hotel is perfect, turn left out of the hotel and the Louvre is in front of you, a minutes walk takes you to the River Seine. I opted to do the bus tour of Paris but wasn't sure which bus company to take and again the staff filled me in with all the details (the sightseeing stop is also located about 2 minutes from the hotel).

Decor was nice. We did have a problem with the shower head being broken, which we advised to reception, but being over the weekend, nothing seems to happen whilst casual staff are on - a little disappointing (higher price doesn't always mean better - bathroom in Tim Hotel was comparable and in working order). They state that the toilet is separate and it is but you still have to go into the bathroom to get to the toilet. Staff were helpful and friendly (as was in Tim Hotel), lift very small (same as TH), rooms were non smoking and fresh (TH room was supposed to be, but we were told guests disobey - this was probably our main gripe with TH). The location was reasonably close to Metro and Hop on Bus stop, lovely atmosphere on Pont de Arts on Saturday evening - just steps away. There is no breakfast room - which didn't really bother us, as there are cafes nearby. We were leaving Paris via Eurostar, and this hotel is within a reasonable taxi ride to Gare Nord.

Anyone who is particularly sensitive to noise should avoid this hotel at all costs. As the previous reviewer noted, sound-proofing is minimal. You could hear someone cough in another room (I don't know whether it was upstairs or downstairs). Furthermore, the (interconnecting) rooms facing the so-called courtyard (a postage stamp of a paved area, with the back walls of other buildings rising on every side of it - not a pleasant view!) are subject to any conversations or sounds from the occupants of the ground-floor room which opens on to this patio (guests beware!) - every word of conversation carries up the air well clearly, as well as cigarette smoke!

The Ritz or the George V can't beat that! Secondly, the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable and very accomodating.

Loved being able to just cross the street to get to the Louvre, also just around the corner from the Seine. I stayed here in April 2005 for four days on a budget trip, and given the hotel's location, I was able to walk almost everywhere. However, the hotel is located on a street that at night is quite secluded and desolate. And, except for the coffee shops facing the Seine that close at 9PM, there is a scarcity of restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Yes, the patisserie at the corner was wonderful, quite lovely, it was my favorite place for breakfast. But dinner options are limited. One night I got back from sightseeing at 9PM, wanting to eat quickly, and feeling too tired to wander far in search of a restaurant. It was very annoying to find that everything in the area had already closed at that hour. The only options within a few blocks were a smoker's bar, and an actually rather nice Chinese restaurant. The other problem I encountered had to do with the hotel management. I'd booked a double room months in advance, but upon arrival was shown to a tiny single room whose bed was basically just a couple of mattresses thrown on the floor. The staff tried to argue that this is what I had reserved but fortunately I'd brought with me copies of my reservation confirmation, so they were forced to acknowledge their error. Even so, my actual (also very small but much more reasonable and comfortable double) room had already been given away and since the hotel was full, I had no choice but to stay one night in the smaller \"room\" until I could be moved the following day. If I hadn't been so exhausted after a long flight from NYC, I would've changed hotels at that point. My experience of Paris itself more than made up for these inconveniences, but next time I'll stay somewhere else.", "Date": "January 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "An American in Germany", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4354539", "Content": "Stayed with our 2 daughters for 2 nights, small but just how long do you want to stay in your room in PARIS?

First, the room was so small. There was about a foot on each side of the bed and a tiny table with a small TV at the end of the bed, and a bathroom, which was dirty!

I am a single woman who travels alone and this hotel is in the back of a narrow, dark quiet street that I was followed down by strange men on several occasions while walking back to the room at night. My third night I was so frightened I came back to the room in tears and told the staff I would be checking out in the a.m. and flying back home, cutting my trip short by 8 days! They gave me the local number for AA, gave me a copy of my bill and sent me away. Fortunately, the AA rep convinced me to try another hotel, which I did (Hotel Moliere, much better location, slightly less expensive, MUCH larger room with 2 balconies and nice staff!). After checking me out and having me sign my 'final' bill, this hotel put another charge on my card without my signature for a cancellation fee that they could not bother to tell me about to my face.
