I was quite intrigued by all the hot air balloons on the wall paper and the balloon shaped lamps. Saint James was apparently the first place where hot air balloons went up in France. It also reflects on three balloon shaped pavillions which are being used as bar area when the weather is nice. We stayed in one of the suites and the room was very spacious and beautifully decorated. There's a lot of attention to detail and we could not fault anything. The metro-tiled bathroom with bathtub and separate shower were very relaxing after strolling through the streets of Paris. The hotel has a very convenient location, only at 15 minutes walking from the Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es and there's a metro only a few steps from the hotel.

The sinks were both surrounded by rose petals and the room was spotless. Unlike many Parisian hotels the Saint James has lush grounds surrounding it and the back of the hotel has a wonderful and inviting veranda. Our room, 106, had been recently renovated and exceeded our wildest expectations. It is located on the garden level which might be a turn off to some people because of not having a view, but we found the absolute quiet to be the perfect trade-off. The walls of the room are finished with hand painted murals and the ceiling is fully arched, giving the impression of being in a wine cellar. The bathroom is nicely separated from the boudoir and the room was large by Parisian standards based on what I've seen in other reviews. The concierges went out of their way to help us book a hotel in Bayeux for our trip to Normandy and booked all of our train tickets and excursions as well.

Down a long hall on the main level was the bedroom and marble bathroom with double sinks.
