From the first look upon arrival, lobby was too dark, gloomy and somber. The rooms on the internet seemed normal size, but in fact they were too small ( a double-bed room) for 2 people and their luggage. Housekeeping was the worst by far!!!! they barely cleaned the room, made the beds and the bathroom was horrible. at the beginning of our one-week stay, we found 4 rolls of tissue paper, they were our \"allowance\" for the week!!! The towels weren't changed and when we complained, there was no response whatsoever!! The staff was a bit rude, except for one guy at the front desk, he was friendly and helpful :)....Beware of the breakfast they offer: I can't even put it in words, it was a sample of a breakfast :S.... I think the best thing about this place was the wi-fi connection, and the fact that it's very close to Istiklal cadesi (street) and 3 metro stations are nearby, other than that; just enjoy the bustling city and have a nice time there, you'll definitely fall in love with Istanbul <3", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cReally really bad\u201d", "Author": "Tom-Muc00", "ReviewID": "UR111385514", "Content": "We (couple) stayed there for 1 night. Worst hotel ever: Very filthy, dark room with outdated paperhangings and carpet. Staff is making you feel you're not welcome (to say the least). When we got the keys of our room, there was still a used towel hanging in the bathroom. The ac was on - but we couldn't find any remote control to turn it down. The next day we complained about it at the reception desk - but the staff was just looking at us in despise. The beds were ok, but the overall impression of the room did not make us comfortable. Internet was not working in the room (ok, this is the case for most hotels in Turkey) but in the lobby. Bathroom: Mould between the tiles and at the ceiling. The water in the toilet was running a bit. Breakfast: Really bad - bread, cucumber and these prepacked jam portions. Synthetic juice and horrible coffee. We decided to leave the next day - at 11 in the morning, we had to carry our heavy luggage down 3 floors as the lift was out of order. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Right, it might be one of the cheaper hotels in Istanbul, but we checked in into another hotel the same date for the same price which is just marvelous. City centre too :-)", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cMy Worst Experience Ever\u201d", "Author": "nohaezzeldine", "ReviewID": "UR89671642", "Content": "The worst service ever, combined with extremely rude & hostile staff (specially the front desk officers) managed to totally spoil our trip.

We went in off the street and asked them to quote us a price for a 2 night stay for 2 people. They quoted us 150 Lira (75 Euros) for the total stay (which is in line with a previous reviewer's price). We confirmed that this was for the whole stay and not per night over and over just to be sure. But when we came to check out they said that it was 150 for one night not 2. If you don't pay they threaten to call the police but it is a complete scam - they are just banking on you being too scared to let them call the police. And they take copies of your passport when you arrive so you can't just leave. In fact they tried to physically restrain me when i tried to leave (after having paid them the agreed amount)!", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cAvoid, unless you have a low budget (or low standards!)\u201d", "Author": "bottams", "ReviewID": "UR7943151", "Content": "My travel agent booked this for me, along with my flights, describing it as \"cheap but clean\". I suppose you could get away with this, as long as you didn't look too deeply. The bed linen was clean, but there was nothing between the sheet & a grubby, lumpy mattress. The towels were clean, but tiny & very thin. The tv was broken, the view was a brick wall, the room was miniscule and to cap it all, the door had been kicked in! I stayed for a couple of hours and then packed our cases, made our excuses & left. Even having paid for 2 nights in advance was no incentive to stay here! I have to say that the desk staff were actually very nice! Having told my Turkish friends my tale, they tell me that it's a very old hotel, 99% used by Turks/Iranian/Iraqis and just very tired.
