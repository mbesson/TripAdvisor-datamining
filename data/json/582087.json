Air conditioning was installed, but as it's not summer in Barcelona it was only set to pump out heat, there was no way for them to turn it on to cool, the hotel didn't seem to understand that because I'm from the UK, Barcelona in March is actually quite warm. The rooms in general were clean, but the top sheet on the bed looked quite old and grubby. The fresh towels everyday had a pretty bad smell and the bathroom could do with a little bit of updating. I only had breakfast in the hotel on one morning, but was without doubt the worst breakfast I've ever had, the breads were dry and stale (and the selection was extremely small - most items had run out), there was no orange juice in the machine.

Advice: If you stay here and plan to go to the beach, use the bus - bus 57 or 157 with stations on Paral.lel (right next to Poble Sec metro station) will take you right up to the beach as compared to changing two metros and then having a long walk from Barceloneta station.

What we did not like was the smell of urine in some parts of Barcelona, including some of the streets around the hotel. We stayed in a room at 6th floor with a view towards the street, preferably to a view in the inner yard (very dark). The side effect was that it\u2019s not possible to sleep with window open because of the noise of the cars that collected the garbage in the morning (we used the AC as much as possible, but not during the entire night). The room overall was comfortable, spacious enough for 2 persons and quite luminous. There was, though, a bad odor when we returned and especially in the first day. The bad is very hard, which for some people may be an issue, for us was ok. The pillows are very narrow but you can always use the extra ones available in the wardrobe. The cleanliness of the room was reasonable (there were some parts on the desk with some dust in the first day and the wall paper stained by previous tourists). We did not appreciated at all the fact that we were given only one small soap daily and in the last 2 days not even this (we had to use shower gel instead). The best thing we highly appreciated in every evening after a full day of walking and in every morning to wake up was the high-pressure shower \u2013 one of the best! Also, some other small inconvenients were that you may use the free internet in your room but you must have a cable (they don\u2019t have wireless), otherwise you must pay 4e for it; also the magnetic cards for the doors did not work too smoothly (at least for us and our neighbors).

Everyone that works there that we came in contact with was really great. They spoke both Spanish & English, and were more than willing to give ideas and tips for going out. Our room was overlooking Carrer Rocafort, and with the windows closed, it was very quiet.

The room was not palatial by any stretch, but who really cares when all you do is sleep & shower there. The bathroom was very nice, spacious & clean. Just watch out, as housekeeping likes to face the shower head to the wall. We flooded the bathroom a couple of times before we realized.

About the hotel: the room was small but good enough for a couple of days, the bathroom was very spacious and both were very clean. You have a mini-fridge in the room. At breakfast you can find fruit, cereals, yoghurt, muffins, bread, bacon, eggs, etc. I can advise you to not be amazed, if you don't see much of these things one hour before the breakfast close.

I arrived via bus at Estacio Nord, walked a block West to the Arc De Triomf metro, took the red line to Rocafort and walked 3 blocks south. The hotel entrance is large and easy to find. The lobby was a bit warm, but check-in was fast and courteous. There are 2 computers with internet access which is very convenient. My room was small, with 2 singles pushed together and not much space to get around the bed(s). There was an lcd tv on the wall at the foot of the bed that I only managed to slam into once. My wife was not so lucky. The other con was that I think the beds were made from slabs of granite. If you like a \"firm\" mattress, you are in luck! The air conditioning worked well, but I preferred to open the large window as the October air was cool and refreshing. The bathroom was large with a shower with excellent water pressure. The finish looked very modern. Towels smelled clean, but looked a bit rough. The room comes with a safe, but you need to put down a \u20ac20 deposit that you get back at check out when you return the key. We were able to leave our bags after check out which was very convenient for our last day. The hotel is in a nice area of Barcelona with plenty of small grocery stores, restaurants, and bars. It is 1 block away from the Poble Sec metro on the green line that takes you to most of the tourist sites. You can walk to La Rambla in 25 minutes through some of Barcelona's more colorful neighborhoods if you don't mind that sort of thing.
