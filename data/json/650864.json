People smile to me, I feel like a real person (yes... in an Italian hotel... hard to believe, I know), prices are much lower (makes it an excellent quality/price ratio to me) and Wifi is free! The only issue is about dinner in the evening. No restaurant on site unless you plan ahead or decide to go have dinner downtown (who would be stupid enough to have dinner in a hotel when staying in Rome, anyway?).", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucestershire", "Title": "\u201cA little bit love / hate for this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Zarek", "ReviewID": "UR122988729", "Content": "Stayed here on a one evening business trip. A non-pretentious business hotel which I liked. Surprisingly large rooms and walking distance to the commercial area I need to visit. Free fast wifi too. The restaurant menu and ambience was awful. Well worth the \u20ac20 taxi fares to get to a local pizzeria I felt. Although for breakfast, although cramped and simple, it was quite adequate. Service friendly but a little amateur. The main reason I have only rated Tre Fontane a 3 is the room rate. \u20ac110 was just a bit too much to be good value. Put a decent desk in the room, provide a few toiletries and improve the restaurant and I would rate it above some of the other posher hotels I have stayed in on trips to Rome.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cClean, Friendly, and Adequate\u201d", "Author": "WorldScout", "ReviewID": "UR102322272", "Content": "Like other reviewers, I stayed at this hotel for a short business trip, and found it to be adequate for those needs. Small hotel, but reasonable size clean room with comfy bed and good internet connection, and a friendly/helpful staff. However, other than breakfast, which does not open until 7am, there were no food options on a Sunday, both in the hotel and in the immediately neighborhood. We had to take a taxi about 10 minutes away to find anything open. Nothing to see site-seeing wise in the neighborhood, and although the metro is very accessible, it can be a bit of a hassle to get around for \"touristing\".

Indeed it is a business hotel, not a tourism hotel. There are a few large corporations and organizations nearby, explaining the hotels location. It is in a very quiet street (the hotel is actually not directly in Via del Serafico, but in a small street that gets into Serafico). The entrance is quite humble. Not a lot of luxury. But the room I stayed was very good. Lots of space, clean, a good bathroom, a good desk to work on. Roomwise, a great place to work. Tv reception was lousy. Bad signal. That might be a problem only in my room, but I didnt worry too much, since I had plenty of work to do. Breakfast was ok. Simple yet effective. Juices, capuccino or tea, bread, and others. I didnt like much the restaurant (dinners). Very few options and not cheap compared to restaurants in the streets. Locationwise, the hotel is a 10-12 min walk from the metro. Goin to the metro is ok, cause the street goes down. Coming back is the problem. Hehe but I found that the 764 bus comes directly from the metro to the almost front of the hotel (and since you use the same ticket crom the metro, youdont have to spend anything else. Its a 1-2 minutes drive from the bus! I would say around 2-3 stops). Most local business are 5-10 minutes walk. Very few eating options nearby. Summarizing, if you are going on a business trip, I trully recommend this hotel, but if going for tourism, perhaps not the best place. Suggestion: if you dont an to go out for eating at night (tired like I was), you can order from Casa Chef. Its a great restaurant that delivers to the hotel.

It was perfectly comfortable and fit my requirements nicely. Most importantly, it had a fast and very reliable wi-fi internet connection in the room, which was critical for me because I had a lot of work to do. The room was large as European hotel rooms go. So was the bathroom. A nice balcony. Reasonably quiet surroundings - the hotel is located a half-block off the main road so traffic noise isn't bad and there is no pedestrian noise. Breakfast was a little more than the usual fare. The location probably wouldn't suit most tourists -- it is a 15 minute walk to the metro and then about 25 minutes from there to downtown Rome -- but for someone who is in Rome to work it is ideal. Also, there's not much in the way of restaurant options in the neighborhood -- I found some good pizza joints on the other side of the metro stop, a 20 minute walk.

The hotel overall was clean, comfortable, and very quiet. I had a large room with all the usual facilities and they served a good breakfast with excellent coffee. The hotel is in a side-street, with open views, a couple of hundred yards from a major metro station and bus interchange. So it is very suitable for business in this part of the city. The vicinity is a residential and (non-retail) commercial district so little is available by way of restaurants or shopping. The area the other side of the metro station looked more lively but I didn't have the opportunity to investigate. There was a good cable internet connection in the room. Staff were friendly and helpful. The clientele appears to be very much business oriented.
