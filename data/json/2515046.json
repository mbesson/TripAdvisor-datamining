I booked the hotel after reading the multitude of positive reviews on tripadvisor, combined with the hotels photographs, I thought that for the price it was too good to be true. The price was excellent for paris so the hotel really can not be criticised in this respect. I must say that we did not find our stay particularly enjoyable. The hotel is quite a way out of the city but we knew this prior to booking, and the area is actually quite nice. It is away from the hustle and bustle in a more residential area, surrounded by an abundance of French bakeries and Cafes. The train station is a pleasant walk away and from there it is only a short trip to a lot of the major sight-seeing areas. The hotel itself does not have any facilities as such, there is an overpriced continental breakfast which consists of a few different types of pastries and filtered coffee, there is a much better selection at the surrounding shops. There are no in-room fridges, and hardly space in the tiny rooms to open your suitcase, and the bathroom and shower are the smallest I have ever experienced. You literally can not spend any time in your room. The bed is also very poor quality and has cheap low-quality bedding. I understand that we were in France, but the front desk attendants are unable to understand English, and did not book our early-morning cab to take us to the airport, even though we requested it and confirmed it twice. There is also no English television channels whatsoever. I do not want to come accross as an ignorant English-speaker but it makes your stay extremely hard if you are unable to be understood by the people who work in the hotel. All in all it was an average stay, hence the 3/5 rating.

It's definitely off the beaten path and not in the most Metro-accessible location (although there are bus lines nearby, and you're still a ten-minute walk away from two Metro lines and the tram). That said, it is refreshing to be away from the hustle and bustle of central Paris when you're just looking to chill, as I was. The hotel definitely lives up to its name - it is top-notch on the inside, short of lavish but still new, chic, and cozy. Its amenities more than make up for what it lacks in location. Perhaps best of all, it was a steal of a deal, very reasonably priced against comparable hotels. you could stay in a worse hotel somewhere in the inner ring of arrondissements, but it would probably set your budget back at least twice as much. So, to sum up, if you don't mind being in a peaceful area of the 15th but still within striking distance of Paris's \"greatest hits\" and are looking for a hotel that's got plenty going for it and won't break your bank, chances are the Home Moderne is your kind of place!

My gf and I recently spent five days at this hotel. The bathroom was very clean (my gf insists on clean bathrooms), rooms were adequately sized and my overall impression was of high satisfaction.. The cleaners were very thorough (BUT watch out for the cheap poor quality loo-rolls....) It was the coldest week of feb, but the heating was perfect. We were handed a wifi password- but we didnt follow up on it as we hadn't brought a laptop. Some people have mentioned on here the fact that this place is not central so I was a bit apprehensive, but to be honest the 10-15 minute walk to the metro was no big deal. We actually enjoyed the short walks because it gave us a chance to check out the local area for cafes and restaurants and pop into the local boulangeries and just generally soak in the non-touristic parisian life! There is a kettle in the room, and as others have commented, the coffee/tea is not replenished. Being a caffeine junky, I was worried about this after reading the review, but I simply popped into a local supermarket and stocked up on these essentials, as well as a pint of longlasting milk. simples..! Pick up some bread or patisseries from either of the two boulangeries that are within a stone's throw, and you won't need their expensive 8 euro breakfast..... Noisewise.. as it was a valentine's citybreak, I had been looking for somewhere where my hotel neighbours wouldnt give us the evil look in the morning for keeping them awake...(!) I would say the room was fine on this aspect. My room was next to the stairway, and therefore no neighbours directly adjoining. We could hear pple walking in the stairway or corridor though, so I wouldnt say the place is soundproof, but you don't get the impression that someone will overhear you all night, if you get my drift.

We recommend: Trying a pizza at the local pizza restaurant - just a few doors away from the hotel, traditional (Italian) stone baked pizza's and very friendly, courteous staff. The restaurant to look at is nothing special but the food is delicious! Le Luna restaurant - Traditional Parisian cuisine a few doors up from the restaurant. Very chic and full of friendly locals who are happy to help you with the menu and give you information of the history of the local area. - Be warned though, as this is not a typical fast paced tourist area don't expect a fast paced city like service. These lovely locals are very relaxed and this shows in their approach to service, you may find yourself enjoying soaking up the Parisian atmosphere and wine! If not your style there is always McDonalds! Also be aware of beggars who pretend (or maybe not) to be deaf & dumb by the Eiffel Tower, they can surround you (up to 6/7) at a time and could easily pick pocket you if your not careful! PLEASE REMEMBER! We only found out on our last meal out, but when you receive a bill you will find a breakdown of VAT and service charge added which is always combined within the price of the meal - So if you wish to leave a tip then as we were told this is an added bonus to the already existing hidden service charge, so maybe 1-3 euros should suffice.

The Metro is not close, but it's not very far either. We were there for 5 days, and bought the Unlimited metro pass, which was a life saver. There wasn't a single day where we didn't take the over the road tram (which is about a 10 minute walk) to one of the metro stations. If you can't walk more than 10 minutes, honestly, Paris is not for you. Anyway, more on the hotel...on the exterior, looking at it, you wouldn't know what to expect, but once you get inside, you get the feeling that it really is a lot more modern than what the building appears to be. The lady at the front desk was VERY helpful, and spoke English very well. Once we got to our room, we were even more pleasantly surprised. You see, in Paris, hotels are not usually in new buildings, and Paris is one of the most visited places in the world, so hotel rooms are small, to get the most out of buildings. For what a single cost in the middle of Paris, you get a very modern, clean, and comfortable \"suite\". There's no microwave in the room, which is the only thing we wish we would have had, but the mini fridge is decent, the bed is comfortable, and the bathroom (with a separate toilet) was very nice. There's a bakery in the corner, which is quite good. There's also a bar/cafe across from that who serves a pretty good bacon cheeseburger and fries. A couple doors down, there's a fruit and vegetable stand, with a small convenience store inside, and there are a few restaurants before you reach the end of the block.

I think the walls are paper thin. Recently I've became a buffet breakfast enthusiast! This Bfast was a 2.5/5. An expensive 8 euro and not much selection compared with other hotels, when i asked for a second cup of tea they said simply \"there is none left\". It didnt seem like a busy morning and we were eating at a peak time. Can get some AMAZING pastries nearby for 1 Euro. Coffee is expensive in the area at 4.5 euro. There is a GREAT fruit shop just across the road. I recommend that. Staff were great, friendly and helpful. Rooms and lobby are in good condition. Lobby looks recently redone. The room was clean and in between new and old. Wouldn't like to stay there with a family, but hotel is good for a trip when you only need a place to sleep and shower. Is a bit away from the city centre but public transport is good and frequent. NOTE THAT AT THE TRAIN STOP CALLED 'CONCORDE' (LOUVRE, CHAMP ELYSEES ETC) THE LEFT HAND TICKET ENTRANCE MACHINE IS BROKEN AND YOU CAN GET THROUGH IT FOR FREE.

First of all, the reviews on TripAdvisor are incredibly precise. I booked based on these reviews and we were not disappointed. Pros: - The entire hotel is very clean and well-presented. - Staff are friendly, even if required to speak English in order to avoid my awful attempts at French. - Excellent value. - Safe, friendly neighbourhood. - Free Wi-Fi in hotel rooms. Strong connection. (Get log-in details from reception.) - BBC World and CNBC in English on a nice TV. - Location: We had breakfast every day from the two excellent brasseries and the fruit stand nearby. We had dinner most nights from one of the three excellent pizza restaurants nearby. We bought snacks and lunches from the two marches (supermarkets) nearby. (And when I say 'nearby' I mean on the same street as the hotel! All of which are affordable, friendly and top quality.) Also, there is a really nice, family-friendly park across the street. Cons: - Location: This is debatable. Whilst the local metro station (Porte de Vanves) is a short walk away, most sights required changing trains at least once or twice. This amounts to a 30-45 minutes at the beginning and end of each day. How well you cope with this will depend on your circumstances. We are a 30-ish old couple and it was fine. An older couple or young family might find this to be hard work. Finally, I'll say this might just be the Paris Metro. Almost everywhere we went required 1 or 2 line changes. Look into the 95 bus if you get a chance. I think we might have missed a trick here. - As others mention, they only provide tea/coffee in the room on the first night. Henceforth, you can replenish the supply for 50 cents from reception. We found this a bit odd. - The room was small, but we didn't find this to be a problem.

First is the location, it is a bit of a hassle to get into the 'Touristy' central area of Paris on the Metro, although there is a bus (95) from outside which goes into the centre, but we did not use this. At the end of a long day of walking, you don't feel like getting 2 trains and a walk before you can rest in your room. Convention station is about an 8 minute walk away, I would suggest this stop over Plaisance as the area is much nicer. Montparnasse is also about 15 minutes walk, and this has alot of lines to choose from. Most of the popular parts of Paris are not more than 20 mins away on the Metro from Convention. Second was they don't refill the tea/coffee/hot chocolate, which isn't a major issue, unless of course, you drink alot of this stuff or put them into your bag regularly. Everything else was excellent. The room is modern, clean, smallish, but easily big enough for 2 with plenty of room around the bed, a desk, chair and wardrobe. Bathroom is large, modern and clean with a good shower. Wall mounted LCD, lots of channels, only 2 in English but you're in France, aircon was also in the room which worked very well. It was very quiet from street noise, but the walls are not thick, we could hear water, and any bumps from rooms attached to ours. I found the bed fine and had a good nights sleep every night. Outside of the rooms, reception staff were all very nice and helpful, spoke English when required and didn't mock when we attempted to speak French. They have a free baggage storage area which is handy. We didn't eat here as there are patisseries everywhere, although we couldn't find a takeaway coffee nearby. The area is quite residential, a park nearby, street stalls and restaurants are all on the way to Convention station. As mentioned, I would use Convention station for the Metro as the area is nicer, Plaisance is the other sttaion nearby, but the area feel and looks more dirty and dodgy.

First, the hotel is spotlessly clean. The rooms are cleaned daily, and it is a real cleaning (floors swept/mopped, bathroom thoroughly cleaned, etc.), not the typical \"swap out the towels and make the bed\" that so many hotels do. The room was not large, but the size was more than adequate for two people. When you consider that you are in Paris and hanging around in a hotel room is not why you come to Paris, the room size is not an issue at all. The hotel was completely remodeled in 2009 and looks brand new. Check it out on Google Street View and you will see that it was in the process of renovation when the Google car drove by! The hotel is air conditioned, which is very important if you are visiting in July or Aug. Many hotels whose rates are several times those of H\u00f4tel Home Moderne do not have a/c. The hotel is located in a very safe, quasi-residential, middle-class neighborhood, not too distant from the major sights of Paris. The benefit of this is that you are amongst Parisians going about their daily business rather than being surrounded by tourists and the obnoxious establishments catering to them (trinket shops, bland overpriced Americanized restaurants, etc.). There is an excellent LCD TV in the room, though only 2 English-language stations (BBC World and CNBC Europe). Free Wi-Fi worked very well, no problems. The bed was very comfortable, with just the right firmness to suit us. The size seemed equivalent to a Queen bed in the U.S. The hotel was very quiet; even though we stayed for 15 days, we were rarely disturbed by other guests or outside noises. There is a breakfast available for 8\u20ac, but we did not eat there, preferring to buy something from the local bakeries instead. Check-in was very smooth. We arrived a day early and were fully prepared to get a different hotel for the night until our reservation began, but reception was able to get us into our room early, and was happy to do so. We were able to check in immediately despite having arrived at 10 in the morning! During our 15 days, we encountered at least 5 or 6 different staff at the front desk, and they all spoke English and were exceptionally courteous. The front desk is staffed 24 hours a day. Disregard the comments about long walks to the M\u00e9tro. Tram line 3 has a stop at the end of Rue Brancion, 4 blocks away. It is clear from reading the reviews that some reviewers are not aware of this. It was only a 5-minute walk, even while pulling luggage. If even that walk is too far for you, there is a bus that stops every 10-15 minutes right across the street from the hotel, and it takes you to the Brancion Tram stop. If you buy the Paris Visite unlimited M\u00e9tro passes (which I highly recommend), they give you unlimited trips on the M\u00e9tro, Trams, and buses. The tram takes you to many destinations and also connects with several M\u00e9tro stations, RER lines B and C, and another Tram line. The hotel website does not mention the Tram, but the brochures available at the hotel do. Most of the major tourist destinations are less than 25 minutes away from the hotel door by Tram/M\u00e9tro. Getting to the hotel from Charles DeGaulle/Roissy airport (CDG) is easy: Take the train, RER Line B (CDG is the end of the line, so, as the signs there say, \"All trains go to Paris\"). Get off at the Cit\u00e9 Universitaire stop. Get on Tram Line 3 in the direction of Pont du Garigliano. Get off at the Brancion stop. Walk approx. 4 blocks north and the hotel will be on your right. There is a Pharmacy (\"Pharmacie\") and small market right next door. There is a larger grocery store at the end of the street near the Tram stop, and an even larger one 2 blocks north on Rue Brancion, then one block west on Rue de Vouill\u00e9. There are several great restaurants up and down Rue Brancion (I highly recommend Pizza Paparotti), as well as 3 bakeries (Max Poil\u00e2ne is excellent) and a laundromat. In the next block, there is a large park (Parc Georges Brassens) frequented by joggers and with a children's play area. The biggest negative we experienced is the fact that there are no ice buckets in the rooms nor is there an ice machine (and no refrigerator either). Fine wine is ridiculously inexpensive in France, but it is not often available chilled. Without ice, there is no way to chill the wine (or any other drinks) in your room. We also noticed part way thru our visit that the safe in the closet was not actually affixed to the wall, though this was most likely an oversight in only our room. There are coffee and tea making facilities in the room. The coffee and tea is not replenished after the first day, but this was not a problem for us as we simply bought some coffee at the market next door. If you stay 5 or more nights, you get a huge discount off the advertised price (around 50%). We paid 53\u20ac per night for the first few nights, then the rate went down to 49\u20ac on 01 Aug.

It was a mistake on my side to book a date which is 1 day earlier than the correct one so I immediately cancelled the room and booked another one on the correct date. I did see in the terms and conditions that the booking is non-refundable but I was hoping for some understanding as this is not a normal cancellation but an immediate cancellation to a mistake (so they couldn't have possibly incurred any opportunity cost due to my first booking). I sent them an email and they didn't give me a refund, and even saying 'no, it hasn't happened to me' in response to my statement something along the lines of 'I ask for your understanding as I'm sure it probably have happened to you before!'. It's unnecessary customer insult. What they did is perfectly correct to their rules but dealing with these situations is something that separates the goods and the greats in a service business. Second hiccup I had was, the location was a little difficult to find. It isn't next to the underground nor is it next to the main road and the pin on google maps isn't accurate enough so I decided to call the hotel. We were checking in quite late, around 11pm-midnight and the sole staff at the reception, despite being a nice gentleman, did not speak good enough English to provide directions over the phone.

The rooms are pretty small, but if (like us) you are there to see Paris, it won't bother you, as you will only be sleeping at the hotel. We found staff at the hotel to be friendly. Rather than have breakfast at the hotel, we opted to get our breakfast from the neighbourhood bakeries and the fruit stand across the street. Also, one morning we went to the caf\u00e9 across the road from Plaicances metro (which, was excellent).", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cExcellant value for money\u201d", "Author": "Marc027", "ReviewID": "UR96172553", "Content": "Safe location, 5-10 minutes walk from metro.

The breakfast costs 6 euros per person per day and it is poor,just 2 pieces of bread with nutella or jam and coffee or tea. Although, other hotels in Paris charge more than 6 euros per person. The shuttle service to the airport is not working properly, and of course its not free of charge.

The boulangerie at the corner of the hotel was perfect for breakfast on the go. Once we settled in, the distance did not play a factor. We were able to vist Paris during the day and return to a semblance of home in the evening. The little Italian restaurant next to the hotel was amazing and very moderately priced. The hotel was clean. The service was friendly and efficient. The rooms were indeed 'Moderne' and the kids loved the free wi-fi. Quiet hotel with the benefits of being in Paris without the bussle.

You have the convention station about a 15 minute walk down the road or catch the T3 tram then a train at the porte de versailles station. At the station you can purchase tickets in batches of 10 for about 24 euros we used the tickets all in 4 days. The hotel staff is really helpful and pleasant and always greets you.

We had a pack n play set up for our baby so that made the room smaller, but it holds a queen size bed and a very small sitting area. Internet was free and a flat screen tv was on the wall. The bathroom had a shower stall and was also very small. The most important thing for us was that it was clean and it was. We did not spend any time in our room since we were out and about so in the end, the fact that the room was small was of no concern to us. We did however like the fact that there were small markets nearby and cafes, boulangeries, etc The bus let off a block away which was very convenient and it was only a 20 minute ride to all the major attractions.
