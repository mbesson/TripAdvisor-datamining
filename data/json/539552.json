That breakfast that everyone goes on about, all we can say is it was plenty to fill you up, the only down side to the hotel is they do not provide tea and coffee with the electric jug and cups that are in your room (bit strange that) also they do not replace the initial supply of soap etc. The rooms are made up while you are at breakfast that is a big plus. The staff were very friendly. The following are the restaurants that we eat at Mangos very good as usual, Bennos very good, Laser Bar not so good, Besakih good but pricey,Aladdins had to be the best and for a cheap light snack for lunch try the Circle K.For all of those things that we stock in the fridge Hardy's is the place or at least that is until you check out Carrefour's, it is worth just going there to take a pic with the guys on the roller blades and this place has the best fresh cooked bakery you would ever need and the prices are so cheap. Whilst on the big Super Stores, Mataharies at Legian is no longer and the Mateharies at Kuta is left for dead by the Centro Discouvery Plaza but be warned there are no cheap things there. We enjoyed our stay at Sanur and will be back sometime in the future.Sorry for ranting on but that is me, I tell as I see it.Happy Travels", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR405900796", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AB1951"}, {"Content": "Besakih Beach Resort - Loved it!!! My partner and I stayed at the Besakih, it was our first time to Bali and I have to say we loved it!! The rooms were fairly old, but cleaned everyday with fresh towels and sheets. We weren't too fussed about that anyway as we were only in the room when we were sleeping. The staff were all helpful and very friendly. The restaurant which is overlooking the beach was great, and we did not have one bad meal there. The great thing about Bali is that you can eat great food for a cheap price!!  Apparently Sanur and the Besakih is for older people, but we found that there was a range of ages, from 20 through to 80. This place is great for people who are after a more quiet, relaxed pace then Kuta, and though Sanur is still fairly busy its less hectic and full on. We'll be going back for sure :) Reccommend - There is a place called Hardy', a little shopping centre, out the front they have drivers, ask for Damic.

The three resorts were all priced around the same give or take $10 a night AUD.The Besakih however came in at an extremely poor 3rd place when it came to accomodation. This is our 3rd trip to the Besakih and there has been no change to the room type we stayed in since we first went in 1997 and even then they were only average. It really is quite poor. The Besakih however is currently undergoing a refurbishment with some rooms having already being completed and although I did not see one from the inside they do look very good from the outside.I have no idea when they will all be completed.The location of the resort is what could make this appealing In my opinion the best located in Sanur. It is central to shops and restaurants.The food prices are reasonable and breakfast is good but as in all resorts of this rating you will virtually see the same on the menu every day.One other thing I must mention is this is very much a older persons resort if you are young and considering here you may well be dissapointed.It is frequented by older people who visit every year. I suspect that these are priority in getting the refurbished rooms.( Is that right or wrong ?or do we all pay the same ? )All the staff at the Besakih are wonderful very friendly and helpfull and will do anything to try and make your stay enjoyable.", "Date": "Aug 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR352151617", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "delboyPerth"}, {"Content": "Loved the Besakih We have just returned from 7 days at the Besakih and I can highly recommend this hotel. It is situated on what I believe to be the best position on Sanur Beach. Close to shops, restaurants, convenience store and markets. It is on a lovely stretch of beach, whereas other hotels have very little beachfront when the tide comes in. The horizon pool is absolute beachfront and you can swim in the pool and gaze at Mt Agung in the distance. The hotel is frequented by regular older clients who have been coming here for 30 years. The advantage of this to my 2 teenagers was that they had the pools to themselves at most times, the older guests preferring to just laze about the beach or pool and read all day. There were a few younger couples and little ones about and all guests seem to get on well.The only downside was that the hotel is being refurbished at the moment and there was a fair bit of noise, for which the manager personally apologized for. Rooms are quite large with nice verandahs, but the bathrooms not so good, being very mouldy. I figured that I probably only spend 1 hour out of 24 in the bathroom, so it wasnt such a big deal, unfortunately they dont seem to have included bathroom renovations in the refurbishment. I believe they will be raising the prices by 10% when the refurbishment is complete. Staff were all lovely and we knew most of them by name after 7 days. They also have 2 pet dogs and a cat which made my kids feel like they were at home. We loved Sanur, a lovely way to settle into Bali, much quieter than the other side of the island.

After reading all the good reviews below on the Besakih hotel, me and my boyfriend (30/32 yrs, from Holland) decided to book for 6 nights ($45, lucky to get a bungalow). Already the first day we knew we were not going to survive 6 nights at this Besakih Hotel. The main reason was that we were the only young people among big groups of 70+ years old ladies. Our driver later confirmed that this were the regular visitors of this hotel. The quality of the food and staff in the restaurant was really poor. The real season did not even start yet, but they seemed to be annoyed by every quest. Besides this you have to be aware that Sanur as a city attracts tourists who do not leave their hotel for 10 days, make pictures of the traditional Balinese dancing girls performing in their restaurant and then believe they have seen Bali. So looking at the Island in front of Sanur, we dramatically changed our plans the second day and took the first Peramatour boat to Nusa Lembongan, and had a great stay at a secluded 'dream beach' for RP150.000 only. To give you some positives on Besakih: nice and friendly staff at reception, and cleaning force basic, out dated, but o.k. rooms with a nice shower good beachesIf I would advice another hotel in Sanur it would probalby be 'the Taverne'.

We live in Indonesia and travel to Bali fairly often as our first holiday destination be it for a quick weekend or longer. Arriving we were greeted warmly by two reception staff who were very friendly thus first impressions were favourable. Shown to our rooms, two standard rooms in the old hotel part, in fact just a few doors down from the reception area itself on the ground floor. Walking into the room, the first thing we noticed was a very strong pervasive musty smell. Turned on the air conditioner and hoped it would go away. No such luck. The mattress had such a strong mouldy odour that neither of us got much sleep that night. The room was basic, clean, tidy but once you were inside you could be anywhere, it had all the elements of a standard hotel room anywhere in the world. That is to say, absolutely no character at all. We could have been in a motel room in outback Australia. Floor tiles were cracked and stained, furniture well past their use by date, and the bathroom was, to put it mildly, decrepit. Stained tiles and bathtub, ageing taps, dirty yellow/grey grouting etc. The radio/power system set into the bedside table didn't work (so why leave it there?), a door at the back of the room, locked but obviously was a concern. The good thing was that between our two rooms was a connecting door near the entrance door thus facilitating access to our young children\u9225\u6a9a room. Stepping onto the balcony we were faced with a brick wall a metre or so away so not the nicest view when relaxing. My wife wanted to charge her mobile phone and went to reception to ask for a double adaptor. The person behind the counter (a new one who was not there when we checked in) told her to go buy one if you need one. So she went out and bought one, only some time later a porter turned up and gave her one they had found. The next morning I woke early and wandered down to the restaurant and asked for a coffee. I was given instant coffee. Usually most hotels in Bali will serve the delicious 'Bali coffee' . The pool on first glance was very inviting, looking out over the beach and the sea. Closer inspection found it to be covered with a thin film of dust. However, later in the day I sat by it and while it was a lovely view, to get a drink one had to go over the bridge, down some steps, step up onto the raised restaurant floor, wait for the group of staff sitting around chatting to notice you, wait for a drink, ask for a stubby holder, (this caused a few annoyed looks cast my way), one grudgingly found and dusted off, and then back to the pool again. The pool bar was not in operation and looked as if it hadn\u9225\u6a9b been for some time. After the bad nights sleep, an uninspiring room and poor lacklustre service we had had enough. There are heaps of hotels to choose from along the beach strip. We checked out and moved a few doors down to the Gazebo, paying less for a two bedroom, two bathroom, private courtyard, free standing cottage looking out onto a beautiful garden. Big clean rooms, delightfully and distinctively Balinese in design. We stayed at the Gazebo for a further four nights before heading back home. If you really want to enjoy Balinese hospitality, good food, good service and rooms, try the Gazebo. Besakih falls far short for what they charge. However, the pool is invitingly situated with a lovely aspect.

Reading between the lines of other advisors i deducted that if you want a pristine, brand new hotel with limited charecter, then choose elsewhere.

Clean but old bathroom - shower in bath. Comfy bed. Specify if you want a double bed as most seem to be two singles. We were moved immediately when we requested a double bed. Good patio area with clothes rack. Very cheap and reliable laundry service.Good internet service and exceptionally helpful front office staff. Make sure you take advantage of the safety deposit box facility at the front desk. There's a little library where guests leave their books once they leave - great recycling and interesting range of reading tastes. My partner found a great book on the flowers of Bali and was able to identify the many many flowers in the extensive and lush gardens of the hotel. Fountains scattered throughout the gardens with water lilies and lotus flowers add to the ambience of the place.What really makes the Besakih special (apart from all of the above!) is its amazing infinity pool, right on the beachfront - we saw quite a few of the other hotels on our walks and this was definitely the best location in our book. Lying beside the pool looking out to the reef and the volcanoes in the distance is a truly relaxing experience.Note that the swim up pool bar operates a bit erratically and the spa is not working at the moment. Minor problems though, and the restaurant is very happy to bring food and drinks to the poolside.The food in the restaurant was excellent and very well priced - try the fish curry and the satay. Breakfast was extremely good - choice of western or Indonesian breakfast with fresh fruit and you can ask for a very good mixed omelette.We stayed in a standard room (downstairs) and there are also bungalows that look pretty good. We thought the ones numbered 223 to 226 were the best location - apparently the bungalows don't cost any more than rooms.There are also two new Classic bungalows that cost a bit more and are more upmarket (brochure price was US150). While they are very nice, we prefer the older style.The hotel indicated that they were very willing to negotiate on price and suggested we contact them directly by email next time.The Besakih really suited our needs and tastes, but may not suit you if you are looking for something very upmarket and modern.

The wedding was beautiful, the staff at Besakih Beach Hotel went out of their way to ensure that our new daughter-in-law had the day she had dreamed of. The Besakih was a great hotel, after a week most of the staff new us by name - and all had great joy teaching me snippets of Balinese!

Everything was beautiful - I would be back there tomorrow if I could be!Some tips for good shopping - once you have purchased an item - like a necklace or a sarong - wear it next time you go shopping. The hawkers will try to sell you more - will ask how much you paid - and offer to sell for less. Tell them what price you want - we tended to get things for less than half the price we purchased the first necklace or sarong for! Was much easier than cold haggling - the hawkers knew we had some experience. They will often try to take you for a ride if they know you have just arrived. Just tell them you have been there for a week even if you have just arrived! And you have already bought too many/much. If it is your first purchase - aim to get the item for roughtly half their initial price. It really helped me to write a rough conversion sheet on a business card and kept it in my purse - so you know roughly how much money you are talking about when haggling. Work out in your head what you want to pay - but don't be too tough - these people are really struggling with the lack of tourists.
