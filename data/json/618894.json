We appreciated the location, where our bus could easily pick us up in the mornings or we could walk to some of the best curry sausage joints or to Checkpoint Charlie.

This place was a dump, with horrible service. It's simply a way to con people out of as much money as possible while maintaining an air of actual (but non-existent) quality. The rooms, while not looking like much from the photos you may see on websites, are all the worse when you see them in real life. The bed was barely adequate with worn linen and parts of it seeming to have permanent stains. To add insult to injury, I left a scarf in the room by accident. When I contacted the hostel to ask if they had found it, they said yes and very helpfully offered to send it for free if I gave an address which was in Berlin. Coincidentally I had a friend who has a house in Berlin so gladly gave them an address. Turns out that they sent the package by DHL courier and charged the expense to the receiver, so my friend had to pay \u20ac15 to receive a small package which travelled maybe 2 miles !!!

U-bahn station is also just a short walk.. There is also a direct bus (M41) from Hauptbahnhof that could drop you near this hotel Negative aspects: In terms of comfort of stay, I would say that this hotel performs terribly bad.. We stayed in a 4 bed room in the 5th floor. Through out the night we were disturbed with the sound of U-bahn passing nearby.. So the hotel needs to do something seriously about sound proofing.. Moreover, the curtains were really high and it was really hard even for a person of my height (I'm 5' 11) to move it to cover the windows which in effect made light enter the room throughout the night..

There were 13 of us staying here for 2 nights as part of a stag weekend. When we arrived we checked in with minimum fuss. We had originally booked 4 rooms - 3 rooms of 4 single beds and a single but at reception we were offered a even cheaper option of 3 triples and a room for 4 that had become available. Needless to say we were impressed with the service and the 70 euros we saved were then spent on the first couple of rounds of drinks! The rooms are what you would expect - basic, however are well maintained have separate toilets and showers in each room and the beds were more comfortable than expected. Breakfast was included as well and was a good quality continental breakfast with plenty to eat. Just dont expect a full cooked breakfast if you want that option go and book into somewhere else. There is complimentary tea/coffee in reception and free internet as well. It is also in a good location which is quiet but nice and central with most of the sights within walking distance.

I pretty disappointed with our twin room though. We had a corner room with private WC and Shower room, that was clean and simple. Our sleeping quarters felt a bit industrial, harsh strip lighting, with pathetic little bedhead lamps. there was a great fat pillar in the middle of the small room, a precariously positioned tv shelf (the cause of a good few knocks and bumps on our heads), and lots of squashed mosquitos over the celing. There was quite a bit of noise generated by teenage school kids; that combined with the attempt to cover over the glass panelled doors meant that I got a bad night's sleep.
