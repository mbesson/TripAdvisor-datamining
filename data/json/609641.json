More like Hostel!\u201d", "Author": "David R", "ReviewID": "UR123864517", "Content": "My girlfriend and I booked a double room at this \"hotel\" for a night after our 3 night stay in Venice. We booked it primarily for its location. Got there and I must say it looked lovely from the outside. Walked into the reception and again...lovely! Very clean, exactly what you see in the photos. Check-in was no problem. We were given the key to the room told how to get to it. We walked up the very narrow stairs to room 311. Opened the door to find one of the worst rooms I have ever seen in my life! The room consisted of double bed in middle of room, wash hand basin less than a foot from the bed, OUT-OF-ORDER shower, wardrobe with no door with a TV in it. No bathroom, as apparently it's \"SHARED FACILITIES\". The walls were grubby, the bed was not comfortable at all, and the taps were constantly dripping. Within minutes, I tried to access the \"free wifi\" to check other people's reviews, but couldn't get access. Using my mobile internet, we saw some pretty bad reviews. One description we saw, that I would have to agree on was \"A Shelter for the Homeless\". Enough said! There's a reason why most of the pictures are of the exterior and the reception. The room we were in was nothing like the pictures. I imagine those pictures were taken several years ago, and the rooms have just deteriorated over the years! Using my mobile we looked for alternative accommodation, as we could NOT stay in such meager conditions, never mind sleep there! We found the Premiere Inn round the corner. We took our valuables with us (not trusting the safety of the room) to the Premiere Inn, leaving the rest of our things in the room as they were tired of carrying all our stuff with us. After booking a nights stay at the Premiere Inn, we returned to the Belgrave to collect the rest of our belongings and check out. My girlfriend handed the receptionist our key, and said we were checking out. The man looked bewildered, as we had only checked in less than half an hour before. He asked if there was something wrong with the room, to which we replied only that we had found somewhere else, not wanting to embarrass the man. After all it wasn't his fault the room was in a poor state of cleanliness and repair. As it was booked under my girlfriend's name, he asked her to write and sign a statement to say that we checked out at no fault of the hotel. She wrote, and I loosely quote \"Room 311 has checked out, due to finding more suitable accommodation. signed and dated 19th January. My girlfriend and I are 23. We may not have much experience staying in hotels, but we do have standards, and The Belgrave was not up to our standards! For \u00a340, we weren't expecting 5* everything new and room service etc, but we did NOT expect what we experienced! Very cheap, but very poor standards! Dreary and dingy!

We spoke to her and she like us was not pleased with her accomodation or the way she was treated. If you are considering staying at this hotel be warned, Enter at your own wiil.

And as for my room, where do I start? Well, the photos I have attached will tell some of the story...a thick layer of crud on the floor by the door, an absolutely filthy window and a splotch of something brown on the radiator with what appeared to be a pubic hair stuck in the middle of it. No chair. no water glass, a small portable TV with such dreadful reception that everyone's heads looked pointed, a badly cracked washbasin - oh, and speaking of the washbasin, it was so near the wardrobe that unless you were of Victoria Beckham proportions you couldn't even stand in front of it. The shared bathroom was two floors down, and looked like something you'd find in a prison in Eastern Europe.

Additionally, the \"double bed\" my companion and I requested was two single beds pushed together, which is okay, but the configuration only added to the discomfort. They really shouldn't have bothered with the pillows considering they were about as thin as the sheet. At a minimum, this hotel should invest in some decent pillows to improve the service to their guests. Although, the rooms are non-smoking, a subtle but unpleasant odor of cigarette smoke permeated the room. We had an ensuite room, but the bathroom was so small, it was difficult to even turn around in it. It looked like one of those prefabricated bathrooms made for RVs, which was stuck into a corner in the hotel room.

There are shared bathroom facilities, and some rooms have their own shower inside, and when I stayed (4 nights in total) the bathrooms were always kept nice and clean, the beds were comfy with clean sheets, and I felt safe. Might I mention as well LOCATION! Its is just seconds away (on foot) from Victoria Station, shopping malls, bars/pubs, coffee shops, restaurants, theatre (for musicals, etc.), etc. etc. etc. Also close by (like a five minute walk or so) is Buckingham Palace and the Queens Gallery (please go see this Art work its AMAZING). So, for younger travelers or couples, this is a bargin and not only will you save money on your accomodations, you will save money on transportation too! PS Although we didn't get up early enough - breakfast is included in your stay at the Belgrave House Hotel too! That also saves some money! So, if you are wanting to go to London on a budget, this is the place for you. I've stayed at 5 star resorts in Jamaica before and at the best hotels, and really, as long as the bed is clean/room is clean, its safe, and in a GREAT spot, you can't go wrong. I gave the Belgrave an above average because you can't beat friendly service and a great location. The staff there let us stow our luggage and took it to our rooms for us (we arrived very early in the morning) so we could go site-seeing and not miss a day waiting around or dragging heavy luggage about. They offer any help they can give, and are very friendly and accomodating. The hotel is actually a large house/manner rennovated into a hotel, and lots of floors (no elevator) but not hard to find way around. Hope this review helps. PS go see the musical \"Chicago\" you won't regret it!!!", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cNo Frills Concept Hotel gets basics wrong\u201d", "Author": "Fruit99", "ReviewID": "UR10987866", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights in November. We were attracted by the good location and the no frills concept. Why pay more for all the friperies. Unfortunately, this hotel has got the basics wrong. For me, the minimum requirement is a comfortable and warm bed.... However, the bed frame screeched with every move, the matress had seen better days and I could feel the individual springs in my back, the pillow was approx 1cm thick giving my husband neck problems, and the sheet and blanket were insufficient to keep us warm through the night. After three sleepless nights, we were extremely happy to get back to our own bed. The rest of the hotel is fine - clean, but tired in some areas - very new in others. Breakfast was basic but sufficient. But I would not stay here again.", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swindon, England.", "Title": "\u201cTypical 'get-what-you-pay-for' hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Sarah0082", "ReviewID": "UR10453363", "Content": "I booked a triple room for one night for \u00c2\u00a357 through last.minute.

The mattresses are thin and wires poking out everywhere - so uncomfortable! The pillows are so thin it wouldn't have made much difference if we were just led on an empty pillowcase! Breakfast is toast (white bread only) plonked down in front of you. And basic ceral if you help yourself. You have to ask for a drink, which is ONLY tea or coffee! The staff did not speak to us at all. I do not know if this is because they are all foreign or because they are just plain rude!
