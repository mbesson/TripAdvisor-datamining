The window had no view to speak of; there was another building just a few feet away. However, I didn't visit Venice to stay in my room! A few friends of mine had rooms in the annex, which were much less nice than mine (plainly decorated, much smaller, no bidet), so I would suggest that you make a request not to be in the annex. Breakfast was fine; an attendant made fresh cappuccino on request, which was great, and there were some cereals, meats, breads, and canned fruits and juices.

I had a single room. Rooms are variable. From what I saw of the double rooms, most were nice, had small sofas and luggage racks. My room had no luggage rack and nowhere to put or open luggage. Not much room to move around, no other seating but the bed. The bed was two thin twin mattresses side by side on a plank. Not very comfortable. And there was no mattress pad. They said it was a double room, and know that others in my group who were sharing had similar accommodations for two. The entrance to the hotel is nice -- into a garden/patio. But they play music there ALL the time. I had a room over the entrance and had to move. I could not rest because of the music that invaded my room, even with the windows shut and curtains drawn. The room I was then given was on the back and very quiet. But it was also very cold. I had trouble sleeping because of the cold. I asked many times, but the staff said the heat was on in my room. It didn't seem to make any difference. The staff in general were not very helpful or friendly. Though there is a bar in the lobby, getting someone to make you a coffee in the afternoon was difficult. The breakfast is ordinary continental -- cereal, yoghurt, bread, cheese, sliced meat. The hotel is easy to access because it is halfway between the Academia and Zattere stops for vaporetto or water taxi. And you can easily roll luggage there without having to navigate steps or bridges. So the location is good, but the hotel leaves something to be desired. I would insist on a real double room with a luggage rack on the back side of the hotel if I ever went there again. But don't expect generosity of service.

The location of Hotel Belle Arti is simply excellent. We had no difficulty to find it. The best way to get there is with vaporetto (eg. #1), which stops at Academia. (You can check the vaporettos' timetables at http://www.actv.it/en/movinginvenice/waterbusservicestimetable ) You only have to get off, turn left and almost immediately right and after an appr. 1 min. walk on a flat street, you arrive to the check-in desk of Hotel Belle Arti. (We've seen sooo many people struggling with their huge luggages on wheels throught the steps and bridges in the inner city.) The location is good also for visiting the city. Saint Marc's Square and all main tourist attractions are close (in appr. 5-10 min. walk distance). The reception of Hotel Belle Arti, (at which you have to do your check-in also for the Domus Cavanis), pretends to be super busy. The staff do not provide tourist information in extended level, they only do their minimum. Until you do not start asking questions, they are nice. If you want to keep this kind attitude of theirs, I advise you not force receiving answer to your touristic questions... :) If you need plus info about dining or POIs, you will have to buy a book or look for a tourist info center. The room was very clean and simply beautiful. There was TV, which did not work but it was not the main point for us anyway... We found the breakfast to be very good. It is true that the type of food was the same every morning (ham, cheese, bread, cakes, yoghurt, muesli, coffee, tea, juices, etc.) but the sortiment and the volume was more than enough and their quality was perfect. Please note when you book a hotel, the price does not include the local tourist tax, which has to be paid upon arrival.

After staying first night there we went out , and while we were away they took all of our staff from the room without our permission, threw everything in the bags and move it to another hotel. When we came back they already gave our room to someone else and did not have any other room available. My wife's shoes went missing, and most of our cloths were ruined by the creams and cosmetics that they just threw in the bags together with everything else. The manager felt like there was absolutely nothing wrong with that and did not apologize once for what they've done. For our second night they put us to a different hotel across the street Domus Cavanis which is owned by the same people and which is a one star hotel. Next day i spoke to the owner which again was like talking to the wall, no remorse whatsoever, looks like that is normal practice for them. i file a claim for missing and damaged items, and of course i never heard from him again. This hotel as well as Ateneo have ruined my impression of Venice and Italy. As far as Belle Arti hotel itself, it was one of the worst i ever stayed at. They sell it as air conditioned rooms but the air conditioner is blowing worm air and the temperature in the room doesn't go below 28 Celsius (82 Fahrenheit). the room is so small that you cannot open the door to the bathroom because the bed is on the way. when you get into the shower you cant even raise your arms it's so small (i'm not big man, average size). Window is overlooking backyard where the trash is stored. The room is old is falling apart, the wallpapers with holes and stains,broken molding, and the furniture that needed to be replaced 20 years ago.

We went back to the city last week for 4 nights having booked this hotel in September but were concerned about some of the poor reviews on TA. We need not have worried and had a wonderful stay - our room was excellent and the service from all staff within the hotel was superb. We have visited Venice several times now and have always chosen a different sestiere in which to stay but will next time make an exception and revisit the Belle Arti mainly for its great service and value but also for its ideal location midway between two main vaporetto routes serving both the Grand Canal (Accademia Stop) and the Guidecca (Zattere stop) sides of the city.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Skopje, Republic of Macedonia", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, good value for money\u201d", "Author": "batakoja", "ReviewID": "UR60771166", "Content": "The hotel is in a great location, situated less than 20m from the sea shore, very close walking distance to San Marco Square, but still a step away from the crowd.

The hotel is a good 3 star hotel, we considered it is a good value for the last minute price we booked through booking.com (50Euros for double room with buffet breakfast). The room decor was a bit of too much baroque and too much red color for our taste, but the room was clean, heated and quiet during night, which was the most important. Oh, yes, there was no mini bar in our room so you might wanna check this out if you are going to stay longer. We were staying only for one night so we didnt really mind it.

Also, it's a fifteen-minute walk from St. Mark's Square, VERY close to water taxi stops, there are lots of great restaurants in the area, and it feels less touristy than other parts of Venice. The Belle Arti is nothing special, but it was well-priced in the off-season. The rooms are tiny and out-of-date, but the bathroom was very clean. The heat worked well, which was important during cold, rainy January. Aside from the croissants, the breakfast was sub-standard.
