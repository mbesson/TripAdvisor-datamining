The hotel offered free wireless internet, which only had a range that was assessable from the lobby - not the rooms. The breakfast was decent, lots of bread, eggs, coffee, and a sugar drink that was colored orange.

Everything here was under par. Rooms really could use some renewal. Bathroom old. Water came out reddish until it ran for a while. Gave me start when I went to wash my hands. Thought I was bleeding. Everything very dull. Potted plants in the lobby were dying from neglect. I got a bottle of water and when no one was looking, watered the plants. Cut flowers on the tables were there much too long and they were wilted. Buffet breakfast was just very average. Service was poor at the front desk though one young man was helpful. There is also a dinner /show at a place by the name of Sultanas, about five blocks away. There you can have a choice of entree and drinks. Better than the standard tour dinner /show which consists of just appetizers and drinks. If you are going to stay near Taskim Square, find a better hotel Location was just 600 ft from the funicular in the center of Taskim Square that will take you just a very short distance from the ferry terminal. There you can pick up the ferry, 5.80 TL round trip, and go to the last of the Prince's Islands. Have lunch on the Island right on the water front and take a horse carriage ride to the top of the island and then walk to the Greek Monastery at the top of the hill. No cars on the Island. After a visit to the monastery built in 963, you can have a beer or wine at a little restaurant behind the monastery. If you haven't eaten, you can get a nice meal there too. We walked all the way from the waterfront. Unless you are in very decent condition, take the carriage. The final walk to the top will take everything out of you. Spectacular view from the top.

I paid about $80 per night via holidaycity.com for a single room in September which was good for the location. The hotel seems to suit families as well as other travellers.
