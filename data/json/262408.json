The rooms are small (often tiny), but it is very clean, it offers free wifi (ask t the desk for the ssid and password), a complementary breakfast, and it is very convenient to transportation. The staff are friendly and attentive. The hotel is in Sussex Gardens, about five minutes away from the Paddington Rail station and halfway between both the Paddington and Edgeware Road undergound stations. That makes it easy to get to and from Heathrow, and also provides easy access to sightseeing spots in London. Hint: Paddington is probably preferable to Edgeware Road for Underground access - the walk involves crossing fewer high-speed streets and station access is via an escalator rather than lifts. The hotel itself appears to have been recently refurbished - the guest rooms are clean and nicely fitted out. They are small (it is London), and are intended mainly for sleeping. If you want to sit and read, find a pub nearby. Bathrooms are very small, but very nicely fitted out. Plenty of hot water.

A group of my self and 4 friends decided to go to London for a shopping/theatre trip and booked this hotel based on price, location and the option of a parking space. We had a family room for 4 (3 of us slept there and that was cosy!) and a double room which was much nicer ascetically. The family room had very dark, peeling wall paper and the two single beds had less than half a metre between them, the double bed was fine. The TV was great, really big but mounted on the wall above one of the single beds, so the person in that bed had to bunk with someone else to watch our morning dose of Jeremy Kyle. The shower in the family room was scalding hot, and there was no lock on the door, though it looked as if the bathroom had been recently and nicely renovated. We were given a kettle in the room, but with only two tea bags, no milk and a limited supply of sugar. The people in reception were happy to provide more and gave us a pint glass full of milk (??) and some more tea bags. The double room had the opposite problem with a luke warm shower, and they too had to request more tea bags. Our rooms were on the top floor which was 7 smallish flights of stairs \u2013 thank god for the spongy carpet! Saying that, my bed was actually very comfortable and I had a very good nights sleep. The hotel is in a very busy area and traffic sounds start early in the morning, this went un-noticed by myself as I am used to city areas, but it did bother some of my \u2018village life\u2019 companions. Breakfast was served until 9.30 in the teeny tiny dining room which had about 4 or 5 tables squashed together as tightly as possible. There was no option of a cooked breakfast, just toast, some shell on eggs floating in luke warm water and some cold (yep COLD) baked beans that may have been warmed at some point when breakfast was first put out at 7am! There were some tiny \u2018croissant\u2019 type things, to call them croissants would not be fair. There was a bowl with a few token plums and an apple, and some yogurts, but we just ate what we could face and then left quickly. We had to pay \u00a310 for a parking space, which initially there were none of until one of the workers at the hotel moved his car, then it was extremely difficult to squeeze the car in without hitting any pillars. But we got there in the end and didn\u2019t have to move the car until we left the following day. The good thing about this hotel was it\u2019s location, a five minute walk from Paddington tube station, which was perfect for the Bakerloo line which took us to Oxford Street shopping and Charing cross station where we saw the Legally Blonde Musical at the Savoy Theatre. If you are going to a gig in Hyde Park, or a Musical in the west end the Classic Hotel is OK as a bed for the night, but if you are expecting something more, then this probably isn\u2019t the place for you.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cGood location but dishonest !\u201d", "Author": "jiangar", "ReviewID": "UR115470050", "Content": "Booked tonight and paid.

The guy at reception told us that we couldn't check in until 1pm and advised us to come back at around 1.15pm as the rooms needed to be cleaned. I wasn't too happy but to be fair this was mentioned on our booking form. When we arrived back at 1pm he said we would be waiting about 20 mins so we waited. By 1.30pm our rooms still weren't ready and he informed us that we'd have to wait another 20 mins. Eventually at around 1.50pm one of our rooms was ready but we were told that the other room would not be ready for another 15 mins. Slightly annoyed at this we said we would wait together in the one room and wait for the other to be ready before going into the city. At 2.30 pm we still had heard nothing from reception and when i went down to check what was happening the original guy was gone and the new guy said he new nothing about a second room being got ready for us. After he checked that we were who said we were he said the room wouldn't be ready for another 30 mins which would have meant after 3pm. Very pissed off at this stage we decided to head off into London and get our room that evening after we returned. The rooms were small but not at all uncomfortable. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom although quite small was clean. The shower was fine for us and my two teenage daughters had no problem with it. The dining room was quite small with maximum seating for around 16 - 18 people. Breakfast was fine with a choice of cereals plus fresh toast. Orange juice and apple juice. Plenty of fruit and tea, coffee and hot chocolate. There was no fried breakfast but that didn't bother us at all. As a budget hotel this is fine and the location is ideal for easy access to London City. Marble Arch is only 15 mins walk from here. Paddington Station is only 10 mins as is Lancaster Gate tube station which has a direct line to Liverpool Street Train station.

When we got there, we were told that they were doing some plumbing in our room, so we had to spend the first night at an hotel across the street, the ABC Hyde Park Hotel, see my review of that hotel for our first night. As we checked in the next day we were delighted to see that our room (#6) had just been fully refurbished, bathroom included. It was at the back and quiet, perfect for us. Well, almost perfect, as the backyard was used by smoking guests from neighboring hotels, which meant that we had to shut our windows every now and then. The bed was nice, but the room was relatively small and lacked a desk for writing/laptop. What was most disturbing was a rather loud dripping sound that seemed to come from the bathroom upstairs, like a shower head dripping into a bathtub. Internet is free, that's a bonus.

There were tea and coffee making facilities but although the kettle was new it wasn't that clean. TV had 4 channels only but DVD facility.There was also a fan and two extra pillows in the closet. The traffic disturbed a little when the windows were open. The continental breakfast had muesli and corn flakes, tea/coffee+ juices. It gave as a good start for the day. Our flight left in the evening and we could leave our luggage at the reception for the day, which was lovely. It is a small walk to Bayswater and Lancaster Gate tube stations and otherwise in a good location to see London. You can walk to Oxford street or if you are tired you will find lots of shops and restaurants nearby All and all we were pleasently surprised by this classic hotel and would stay there again.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cwill not stay again\u201d", "Author": "DHelm", "ReviewID": "UR17784831", "Content": "The room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wireless-internet reception was so bad I could not use it for work purposes.

No one in their right mind would recommend this place if they had ever seen it. Rooms are the smallest we've experienced on our UK tour. The bathroom is so small you must walk sideways to get to the toilet (I'm not large!). On arrival at 3pm we had to wait for the room to be cleaned, waiting in a small hallway, resting on our suitcases. Do yourself a favor, spend a few more pounds and get a decent hotel. We've stayed at many Jury's Inn's and they are simple but in a whole better category. We could only afford this holiday once and we stuffed these 3 days up for 100 or 200 bucks. PS - Wireless internet in UK is ridiculously expensive, even in hotels.

We only saw the pictures from the hotel website and liked them. We arrived at the hotel at about noon, and what we experienced was unbelievable. First, we had to pay in advance for our three-night stay. As I did not have any experience with terms of payment in hotels, I thought this was a usual handling. We went upstairs in our room. We opened the door and where faced with a huge mouldy smudge. A short vieuw into the bathroom gave us a promt feeling that running away fast would be the best we could do. We went downstairs again to the \"lobby\". Our complaint about the room made the woman working there showing us another room, as awful as the first one. After that, we told her that we would not stay in that hotel any night, and we kindly asked her to retransfer the complete money to our account, which she refused. She told us that we had to pay the full amount for the first night and additionally the fees for the internet booking for all three nights. So, when retransfering the money, she kept approx. 100 Pounds.
