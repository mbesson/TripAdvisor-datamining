{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Budget Villas and Accommodation in Ubud We just walked into our home after a 26 hour trip back home to New York. As you know - we returned to your hotel where we stayed 18 years ago. We stayed in the same honeymoon suite and your hotel remains to be our favorite in the world. It is the only one that we ever returned to and stayed at for a long period of time. staff is friendly and outstanding and helped us in every way possible - including giving us a place to shower before our long trip home ( hours after our check-out). You are the only hotel that ever extended such a courtesy to make our last moments in Bali more comfortable and memorable. Thank you. And in addition of course - your food was delicious and we ate all our meals in your hotel. The drivers that took us to Ubud were also extremely kind , punctual, always with a smile and drove very safely. I am recommending your hotel to all my American friends who visit Bali and will tell them that they MUST stay in your Private Villas. Otherwise their trip to Bali would be incomplete. Please accept our thank you again for the most wonderful memories of your fascinating country and know that we will return - SOON! The Puri Asri Villas is calling us!!!!!!", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR204291195", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Steph-Sofield"}, {"Content": "Enjoyed Our Stay at Puri Asri       breakfast", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR984475629", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Sphnix"}, {"Content": "Puri Asri made my travel terrible in Bali I bit some stones when I ate Nasi Goreng which they served and became very sick- enteritis- during I stayed there.Refrigerator in Puri Asri Kitchen was almost garbage can.I think their lack of awareness of hygiene would cause all the disease to guests who stay there.Male staffs who seems like managers therethey do not know what the services are and low quality of people.They enjoyed talking about guests with other staffs in front of guests or sometimes during guests were eating breakfastand sometimes forgot to serve breakfast.The hotel staffs therethink that guests do not understand Balinese language.I tried to explain my problem in there but their service never changed and sometimes foul my name in Balinese language with other staffs in front of me...Puri Asri villa was the most terrible hotel which I have experienced in my life.Cheap hotel and cheap service.If you have a plan to visit Bali, choose quantity or quality would become a issue.I recommed you to choose quality even though you pay more.Puri Asri Villa, Ubud they suggest cheap hotel rate but do not forget it also included cheap and low quality of service...", "Date": "Mar 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR484662206", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "goodjean"}, {"Content": "Beware  The hotel itself was OK: good, clean rooms; decent rate; apparently very friendly and helpful staff - but that's the killer here. The staff and management are dishonest and conspire to thieve from guests, so beware.On check out, we wanted to spend some time looking around Ubud before driving on and the staff suggested we leave our things with them for safe keeping in the office. Made sense that that should have been safer than leaving everything parked in our Jeep, which are very easy to get into, so we did.We returned a few hours later but had decided to stay another night. We were told by another member of staff on the desk that that would be no problem because the hotel was quiet, so we collected our things and went back to the same villa we had had the night before. 2 minutes later one of the original staff who had taken our bags earlier came round looking flustered and saying that his colleague had made a mistake: the hotel was actually fully booked and we could not stay after all. He apologised profusely but was keen we should leave ASAP. We thought it odd, but moved on.On arrival at our next stop later that night - you've guessed it - we realised that our bags had been carefully gone through and cash and credit cards stolen, in such a way that it would not have been immediately noticeable. I know you might think it foolish to have left these in the bags, but they were hidden deep inside. Our luggage had not left our sight other than when it was apparently being kept safe in the Puri Asri office. No problems while we were there and this seemed to have been a well-practised routine by the manager and desk staff to get our trust before stealing from us, which makes it all the more disgusting.My contact with the hotel since confirms my suspicion that this a systematic thing at Puri Asri and not just casual, opportunistic theft. I've never come across anything like it before and would just like to save it happening to someone else.", "Date": "Dec 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR931971396", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "LunaLondon"}, {"Content": "\u93ad\u612d\u20ac\u6825\u4f04\u6fb6\u2544\u6435\u9289\u6b0d\u510d\u9289?#x201d;       \u9289\u55d0\u5157\u9289\u6825\u5137\u9289\u253f\u5142\u9289\u5a3f\u5157\u9287\ue1ba\u506a\u9289\u6129\u505d\u9287\ue1ba\u4ebe\u9287?/a>", "Date": "Oct 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR502318123", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ryus"}, {"Content": "Bonne adresse   showReview(20248446, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR171779360", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "robby75"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d811168-r18907152-Puri_Asri_Villa_Spa-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "811168", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
