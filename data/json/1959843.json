We were concerned that the location was too far away from tourist locations. It is only a 10 minute walk to Poblenou metro and you can be most anywhere in another 20 minutes. It is a short walk to the beach so...it is a nice way to end a tourist day.....relaxing. The apartment was modern and clean. The only concern was waiting for someone to check us in (1/2 hour wait) - and the address - and where to check in was confusing...since it basically only opens when you check in. A plus (or minus - however you look at it) is that it is in a more traditional Barcelona village...a little different from the tourist spots. Restaurants are not the good in the neighborhood (except for the Pescador restaurant - 1 minute walk...and Casa Marina - 4 minute walk). We loved our stay and look forward to staying again in the future.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cNew and modern apartment with a few quirks\u201d", "Author": "frankfurtflyer", "ReviewID": "UR117133312", "Content": "The location is about a 20 minute subway ride (or bus ride) from the city center, in the suburbian-like area. It is 5 minutes from the beach on foot. In addition to the apartment cost, they charge a few euros extra for the use of the in-room safe box and the pool, which I thought was petty. The apartment key is so difficult to open that it was always an annoying feature after a long-day out. There was a coffee machine in the room that was usable only with a certain type of packaged coffee, which were sold in packs of ten--too much for our three day stay. The kettle was available at the office, (on the other side of the block)--why can't it be available in the room? Although there was a dishwasher, the glasses, plates and silverware were not clean! The spoon was sticky and the mugs had tea stains (which were easily removable with a swipe of a sponge!). The 'concierge' services offered by the woman checking us in was helpful.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201c\"Home\" in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "ByrenToronto", "ReviewID": "UR115962258", "Content": "Our first ever week in Barcelona was made nearly perfect by choosing this apartment/hotel. We had family visiting us from the UK so initially rented a two bedroom/two bathroom apartment. Spacious, clean, great view of the part and ocean (across the street). We then moved to a one bedroom and were equally impressed. The staff (especially Pia and Maria) were very very helpful. The surprise was the area - Poblenou and Rambla del Poblenou - a great community area with local flavors, family and food - a definate bonus. The only problem we had was locating it. The apartments are on a main street - Passeig de Calvell but the address shown is the office and is on a very small street and hard to find. Make sure you have their phone number to find them and then all will be well. If we return to Barcelona we'll stay again for sure.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Lugaris Sea The Home Concept", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1959843-Reviews-Lugaris_Sea_The_Home_Concept-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$177 - $402*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ De Vidal i de Valenciano, 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08005</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1959843", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f6/2c/f62c571a18a9958a83c207d85cacc5db1large.jpg"}}
