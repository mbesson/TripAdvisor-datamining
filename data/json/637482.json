{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The Elektra is a fantastic eclectic building in the heart of downtown Seattle The Elektra building is the home of the most eclectic flats in downtown Seattle.Dreamland Lodging, on the other hand, is a spoof on the vitality of the building. I booked my stay and had to share a one bedroom with two other guys. The room was very nice, but I had to share with two other grown men.The Elektra staff, albeit they are here to serve residents, were exceptionally friendly and helpful during my stay.The concierge staff went out of their way to help me, even though the staff is primarily here to serve the residents.When I come back to Seattle - I hope I'm lucky enough to stay in the Elektra, but will go with another company (other than Dreamland Lodging). Go to the rooftop decks for a panoramic view of this beautiful city. Stay in the Elektra building if you get the chance.", "Date": "May 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR423294724", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TA2007BC"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d637482-r7726740-Dreamland_Lodging-Seattle_Washington.html", "HotelID": "637482", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
