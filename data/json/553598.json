The lady behind the counter spoke no english though we had our translator with us so that helped. However after we checked in, got our bags in the room, we pretty much checked straight out. I couldn't believe it after such great reviews on tripadvisor, I was sure it will be a great stay but the carpet was extremely dirty, the room very small and the opening windows were very low, it was from our knee high up and very close to the bed, my partner is quite tall and I was worried he would fall out the window at night if he had a couple of drinks! After a few minutes in the room and feeling rather disappointed with it we decided to tell the lady that we'd like to cancel our reservation and I think she took offence to that which was not intended but we couldn't stay there. The room was on the 6th floor western style double. We walked around the corner and for about $16AUD more we found a proper hotel with reception staff etc... Maybe some of the other rooms are nicer but certainly not the one we had and we were not willing to pay $130AUD per night for it.", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR300635824", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "BlaineAmy"}, {"Content": "Great little place!

What a great hotel this was for our first few days in Tokyo -- it gave us a perfect introduction to the city. We were very fortunate to stay in one of the lovely Japanese rooms and, though we are a young couple, we thought that because of the layout and decoration of the room this would be an especially fun hotel for a couple with one or two small children. We imagined the option to change the space with the sliding doors and the novelty of the tatami mats would be pretty amusing. I drank the delicious green tea provided by the hotel every morning and every afternoon. The separate living area made it an especially good place to unwind and adjust our very confused internal clocks after a long flight, and the minibar sure came in handy! Staff was helpful, calling us a cab back to the station and answering any questions we had. Cab drivers DID have difficulty finding it, but I printed out a map that helped somewhat. Neither driver seemed to have this newfangled GPS technology that works with a phone number. Also I communicated with the hotel several times via email, including once to change my reservation because I didn't realize our flight was an overnight one, and they were always prompt and helpful in their response.Overall a fantastic stay.

We paid about $120 per night US for a very spacious Japanese room and we enjoyed the experience very much -- glad we didn't stay in some big chain hotel. Metro access was very convenient and we were able to get anywhere we wanted with no more than one station transfer. The front desk staff was very friendly and they accommodated us with a late 1 pm checkout on our last day. The room was very clean.My only reservations about giving Hotel Kitcho an excellent review is that the 3rd floor lobby -- where Japanese rooms are located -- was absolutely disgusting when we were there. The carpet was badly stained and in need of replacement ... in particular there was one huge reddish-brown stain right outside our door that we jokingly referred to as where they dumped the body. There was no AC in the lobby and it created a very unpleasant and muggy odor when we were there in July -- coupled with the stains I really hated walking to our room. Also, the room itself is definitely starting to look a little worn and shabby -- bubbling wallpaper and big dents in the particle board doors, tears on our Japanese-style futons, etc. (Unlike the lobby, the room was very clean, though.)I honestly don't say this to put people off, and if we had to do it over I would still book the Hotel Kitcho, It's a budget property and you can't expect the Ritz.

The first room was a fantastic single with shoji screens across the windows, a hugh wrap around desk, etc. It was not large by American standards, but was better than many rooms I have had in Europe and very inexpensive considering it is in central Tokyo. The room I had on my last night was not as japanese as the first room; no Shoji screens, etc. Sort of small Holiday Inn feel to it. However, there was a choice of buckwheat hull pillows to be had, depending on the firmness level you wanted, charcoal buckets in each room as natural deodorizor, etc. They provided traditional Japanese robes (Yakata) in each room, which was a neat thing. Also, provided packets of drip coffee and tea, along with a small refrigerator and mini bar in each room.The front desk staff was very helpful with everything and generally had one person who spoke English. The on-site ground floor restaurant/cafe had terrific breakfasts for 10,000 yen (about $9.00) which included a piece of grilled salmon, large bowl of rice porridge, poached egg, little dried fish (warning, looked like shredded coconut - but with eyes), and assorted other little plates of food, plus jiuce and coffee..... The Keiske dinner at the 2nd floor restaurant was OK if you have no other chance for Kyoto-style dinner, but it was a disappointment. Tokyo Cental Air Terminal is in walking distance - even with rolling luggage - and several Metro stops are also within blocks to all of Tokyo is easily available. The immediate neighborhood is terrific with lots of small shops and restaurants; all very low scale and not at all what one would think when you think Tokyo...... I loved the Hotel and its entire experience; especially the price.", "Date": "Apr 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR676574224", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Keith58"}, {"Content": "Great hotel in a lovely area       Cozy beds and nice pillows", "Date": "Apr 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR296257076", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kang_a_ji"}, {"Content": "Experience memorable japanese culture at affordable cost We chanced upon the website of Hotel Kitcho while looking for an affordable and convenient place to stay for our holiday in Tokyo Japan. Upon reading further good reviews on this hotel, we decided to book our accomodation via email. We stayed for 4 nights. 2 nights in Western Twin room (9000 yen) and 2 in Japanese style room (12000 yen). The experience was fantastic especially the last 2 nights in the Japanese room. It was a really big suite for the 2 of us! We were initially worried about getting used to the tatami mats and futon beds but the comfortable mattresses and thoughtful amenities (e.g. attached bathroom with a bathtub for soaking/onsen style, air purifier, microwave oven, sewing kits etc) in the hotel/room removed all our unnecessary worries. It is hard to imagine living in the central district of Tokyo with such an affordable cost and such cosy atmosphere. Our choice was correct. The streets around the hotel in ningyo-cho also traces back to Edo-period and some have retained their flavour and trades [like senbei (fried crackers), amezake (sweet rice wine), soya milk...etc]. The hotel is centrally located near a convenient subway station of abt 5 minutes walk and is easily accessible to other parts of Tokyo thru the Hibiya subway line. Overall, fantastic place to stay! Definitely my choice if I return to Tokyo again!", "Date": "Apr 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR684449292", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "strawberrychan"}, {"Content": "Not as expected but... We stayed at Hotel Kitcho from April 7-9 of this year.The location is good because it is near TCAT (where you get a limousine bus to and from narita) but it is difficult to find it. We stayed at twin B room, although it is bigger than the usual size of business hotel room in tokyo this hotel really needs renovation. The carpet and walls are dirty and lavatory has holes around it.It may not be as we expected, but for 9000 yen a room this may be considered a good deal for an accomodation in tokyo.If room size is not a big deal. I suggest that you get a room at Comfort Hotel Kiyosumi where we stayed for 5 days from march 29- april 3. This hotel is new, very clean, with high speed internet connections in all rooms and with free buffet continental breakfast everyday. It is just the next train stop after Kitcho.", "Date": "Apr 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR795667850", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "distinct_taste"}, {"Content": "Hotel Kitcho a Great Local Hotel This was my first trip to Japan with my wife who is native Japanese and in the USA the past six years. I wanted to experience Tokyo and Japan as opposed to staying in one of the large business hotels. I found the Hotel Kitcho via Google and checked it out on Trip Advisor. My wife was a little concerned because neither she nor any of her friends who live in Tokyo had ever heard of it. We stayed four nites in one of the Japanese style rooms..was excellent..my wife who is on the picky side absolutely loved it...not glamorous and not a lot in terms of services but very clean, spacious and provides a real Japanese experience. Good location near several subway stops and roughly 20 minutes to Ginza, Roppongi, Shubuya, the Imperial Palace and other popular spots. Neighborhood has coffee shops and local places to eat. The Japanese style rooms offer tatami floors, futons and ample area for working, television etc...If you want health clubs, instant room service, big lobbies and the like, go elsewhere. However, if you want to stay in a Japanese neighborhood and enjoy genuine Japanese lodging, we strongly recommend one of the Japanese rooms at the Hotel Kitcho.For those of you still contemplating your first trip to Tokyo I'd highly recommend it as a destination. My first trip at age 46 and although I had the benefit of my wife as interpreter and her personal knowledge of Japan and Tokyo, without her it would have still been a great experience.", "Date": "Mar 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR957986247", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "brysully"}, {"Content": "Loved it!   showReview(4595030, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR535010002", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "IDE"}, {"Content": "Excellent value and location   showReview(4579788, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR933196380", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "wurly_monster"}, {"Content": "Fantastic value   showReview(4442299, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR549818678", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Tired_hikers"}, {"Content": "japanese rooms great   showReview(4396076, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR815677103", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "cewpitt"}, {"Content": "Great hotel, great location   showReview(4153658, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR195496458", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "geesteve"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Value, Great Location   showReview(4071881, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR191183652", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Gboyd"}, {"Content": "Hotel Kitcho - excellent value for Tokyo   showReview(4016344, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR386372088", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "luofei"}, {"Content": "A good choice for budget traveller   showReview(3758441, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR256511826", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "hotel kitcho, we will be back !   showReview(3337779, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR862898488", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Cosy Japanese hospitality in the heart of Tokyo       Hotel Kitcho", "Date": "Mar 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR138173413", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "aukahkay"}, {"Content": "Est\u8c29 bien ubicado y es muy funcional (recomiendo la habitaci\u8d38n Estilo Japon\u8305s)   showReview(16814612, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR597682637", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sandrakan"}, {"Content": "superguenstig   showReview(5027268, 'full');", "Date": "May 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR255566648", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Mae585_123"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d553598-r23045822-Hotel_Kitcho-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "553598", "Price": "$125"}}
