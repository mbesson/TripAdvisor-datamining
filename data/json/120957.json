The location can't be beat! You are so close to the Aquarium and other Inner Harbor attractions. It is such a short walk to the heart of the area; we loved that. The hotel itself is just fine. There is nothing fancy about it, and really nothing wrong with it either. The rooms have updated furniture and features along the lines of IKEA. The room was spacious with high ceilings. We paid in advance for the breakfast. We would have preferred to eat elsewhere once we saw it. The pastries and bagels were stale. You can have an omelet made-to-order; I think I should have done that instead of trying other things. There are two restaurants on-site: McCormick & Schmicks and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. Having never gone to McCormick and under the impression that it is fine dining, I made a reservation there for our anniversary dinner. The dinner was good, but the atmosphere was more casual than we had wanted for a special night. Clearly, this is no fault of Pier 5. I didn't do my homework. If you are going for a special occasion, you may want to go with Ruth's Chris over McCormick. I would stay here for the location only - at $340/night (Friday with breakfast following morning), I might compare other Inner Harbor hotels next time I want to go.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N Plainfield", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely fabulous\u201d", "Author": "NPlainfieldLiz", "ReviewID": "UR128140210", "Content": "This is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at.

You cannot beat the location, we had a balcony room that overlooked the aquarium. You could walk to many restaurants and of course the aquarium in less than 5 minutes.

The bad: 1) Was not really aware of the so called daily \"destination charge\" of $9.95 prior to check-in. This was for amenities that you receive for NO Charge at most other Hotels. Felt like my pocket book was being picked. 2) We arrived early, 11:00 AM and knew that check-in was afternoon, however was told by front desk that room was ready and empty but we had to pay a $20.00 early check-in fee. Another pocket book picking. 3) Informed front desk day prior to leaving that we needed a car for transportation to airport. Next morning they had failed to arrange a car and took cab 20 min to arrive. Front desk didn't seem to concerned that we might miss our flight, and 4) Rooms needed some refurbishing, showing age.

But when Sniqueaway came out with an offer to stay for one night, I grabbed it! The pictures online of the building looked great, directly at the waterfront in the inner harbour of Baltimore. We arrove on a Wedneday afternoon and were greeted very nicely by Kyle (I believe) at the front desk. We checked in without any issues, were even handed a 25 $ voucher towards breakfast for the next morning! That had not been mentioned by Sniqueaway, so that was a nice surprise! We had booked a room for 199 $ with a king bed and harbour view. Now we did have a view into the harbour - when we looked out to the right over the lower roofs beneath our 3rd floor window. And we had a king bed as announced. But it was really only a very small standard room. The ceiling was constructed very interestingly (see pictures), it was going up high and looked very nice. But it only made the room bigger in an optical way, the ground size of the room stayed the same. On the door I had seen the floor map of the whole floor, and there I saw that our room (305) was like a handtowel (a small rectangular), and nearby were much bigger rooms. I would not say anything if we hadn't paid 199 $ for this. Usually I am paying less for a suite in a Kimpton hotel (by using deals)! And the 199 $ was a deal price by Sniqueaway! I looked up the rack rate online, and I saw the regular rate for our small room was 299 $ per night midweek. That is really too much!! And Hubby said he also found we have paid too much, even with that Snq coupon. At least we got that 25 $ voucher for breakfast, and that was really really great! We had the choice between a continental buffet (all you can eat) for 11.99 $ per person and a warm breakfast (eggs etc) for about 15 $ per person. We were standing in front of the buffet and the decision was easy, as it looked really wonderful. Pastries, breads, bagels, boiled eggs, fresh fruits and berries, joghurt, various juices, cereals, granola and much more that I am now forgetting. We really ate the money's worth to get ahead of the price, as we had paid too much for our small room. We were helped by Bill who was very friendly, just like all staff members we met. Kyle (front desk) had borrowed us an umbrella when we went out in the pouring rain for dinner the night before. Alexandra at the front desk helped me out with some key issues, and the maid gave me another bottle of (free) Voss water. The lobby was decorated very tastefully with beautiful furniture. I liked the open style, how you look down onto the lobby when you come out of your room. The architecture was really interesting in this building. But the bath room was unimpressive, I am afraid! Tub and shower combo, this American insult of a bathroom, I still can't believe this whenever I am seeing that. You can bathe 2 small children in that, but not an adult, and definitely not 2 adults. But even worse was the toilet design! Not only was the toilet right there by that joke of a tub, it also had the paper roll BEHIND the toilet at the wall. So you had to get yourself some paper rolled down and ripped before you sat down! In my age (48) I don't always have that time anymore, so even when you rush to the toilet and make it in time, then your spouse has to come in and get you some toilet paper fom the roll behind you. Or you stand up and drip into your underwear while you turn around and roll down some paper. Not good either way! The counter which held the ONE SINK was very big, and it could have easily held 2 sinks. I don't know why they did it like that, I thought that was wasted this way. There was also a hair dryer hanging in a bag from the bathroom door, also we had a safe in the closet plus a (tiny) robe (yes one robe, not two). We had free internet access, so we had brought our laptop along, which we have set up on the desk between the bed and the window. It worked fine. So I watched a german TV show online while Hubby watched some CCN news on the TV at the wall. Another nice thing was that the window actually opened! After the terrible rain on Wednesday night we awoke to a blue sky next morning with warm temperatures. It was March 1st and it felt like May 1st! We opened the window and enjoyed the fresh air. Glad that we could shut off the climate machine, because that was very loud. But at least it worked. I should also mention that they offer valet parking, but right before you get to the hotel you can self park in 2 various public places for $22 per 24 hours. I don't know what valet parking would have been, but I am sure it would have been more. Hubby loved the alarm clock, it looked just like the one I had in the early 70s, but besides ringing it could also say \"Good Morning\" when you shut it off. He would have bought that right away if that had been offered! There was a second clock standing in the shelf across the room, I think it was also a CD player. We haven't touched it, as we stayed only for one night, but it is a nice thing to have. I am sure this hotel has reallly nice rooms and suites, but considering our handtowel sized room was $ 299 ($199 with Snq), you can imagine you would pay the amount of your monthly mortgage payment for one night in a suite there. I have no idea why they believe these prices are adequate. I can get a Spa room or even a suite in a Kimpton hotel for less than this Pier 5 Hotel is asking for a very small standard room. Unless we can find an incredible deal for this hotel (and not just $100 off), we will stay at the Monaco (Kimpton) next time.

The cart was not that easy for me to push, but I needed to do so to clear the doorway. There was no valet parking person around either. It did not seem a very welcome way to enter the hotel. However, the front desk employees were exceptionally friendly, which made up for this first impression. My second 'negative' was the perfume scented spray used in both the rooms and the hallways. It was so overpowering that my eyes were watering. The front desk, with an apology, said that there were no rooms where this spray was not used by the maids. For this reason, the first night and through the next day we needed to keep the sliding glass door partially open to 'air' out the room. It was fine by the middle of the next day.

The location of this hotel deserves 10 stars if I could. The room itself I would give 2 or 3. We needed two rooms since we were travelling with our 5 kids. We had requested adjoining rooms, but all of those were sold out. The best they could do was 2 rooms 10 doors away. I begged for 2 closer rooms and we were then given 2 rooms side by side. The room with a king bed and a pullout sofa was very large and spacious. The mattress on the pullout sofa had many stains and was VERY uncomfortable. My son who slept there did not enjoy it. The king mattress was great and this room had 2 tvs, NICE! The other room we had was 2 queens and those were both nice. Watch the heavy wooden headboards if you have little kids. We had a few headbumps on those. The decor is very nice. Our view out the window and sliding door was really sad. Considering the harbor is there, all we could see were 20 air conditioning units. Really bad. The best part of the trip was the Crabby Hour. It is free everyday from 5:30-6:30. We learned how they make crepes with a very cool crepe maker and each of us got to make our own. The kids loved the plain ones, the adults loved the artichoke/spinach stuffing. Free local Ravens beer and wine made it a perfect evening. The King suite had a nice thermostat on the wall that worked very well. The 2 queen bed room had a very noisy poorly working wall unit. One really strange thing, the counter in the bathroom seemed really short. I am average height and I was bending down to use it. My over 6 foot son looked ridiculous trying to brush his teeth and bending waaaay down to reach the water. Valet parking worked very well but we only parked and took the car out one time. Breakfast was one downfall. The food was not all setup when we came down. There were no plates, no knives, small problems. But all the baked goods, bagels, muffins, danish, toast, tasted like they were first served a week ago. Yes, they really tasted that stale. The one highlight was the fresh fruit. Really nicely cut and displayed and super sweet! Oatmeal, juices, a few yogurts, cold cereals and cottage cheese rounded out the rest of the buffet. The toaster worked great but took about 6 minutes to toast each thing. I can only imagine how crazy that is when a lot of people are all eating breakfast at the same time. There are many amazing wedding rooms in the hotel. What a great location for a wedding or event. All the staff members we interacted with were lovely and very helpful.

My family (5 adults & 1 child under 10), instead of giving gifts, travels to an exciting place each year and this year we decided on Baltimore. We found this Groupon for the Pier 5 Hotel and it was quite a snatch. The important stuff: -The rooms were clean and very spacious with flat screens.

A waitstaff person was on hand to take plates and be of service if needed. Coffee was delicious. -Location: FABULOUS! This city is extremely walkable, and the hotel is positioned in a wonderful spot on the harbor: right in between all the local attractions (Aquarium, Power Plant Live!) and Little Italy/Fells Point. -The general manager of the hotel was very nice and also very knowledgable about the city, recommending some great places. -They do a \"Crabby Hour\" on the weekdays between 5:30-6:30, where they teach you how to make crab dip or crabby crepes and you can enjoy great local beer. They even have crab hats you can wear. Was a great experience for our 7 yr old. Overall, we had an amazing experience together as a family. The American Visionary Arts Museum is an ABSOLUTE must-see!

The folks helping with breakfast were very kind and pleasant despite being so busy catering to all of us (that selection was perfect by the way, and everything tasted great!).

This is located right on the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, 1 pier away from the National Aquarium. The hotel is very nice, clean, and a great location. We had a very reasonable group room rate so I don't know what they normally charge. The only drawback is that the layout is an open square from lobby to rooftop, so that all the room doors face the cavernous opening. This is ok unless there is a loud party or reception going on , as there was the night I was there. I didn't hear it since my room was far enough away, but others in our group complained about the late night noise. On the other hand, the view from my room of the Inner Harbor was nice. Internet connection was free with the room and worked fine. There are 2 high end dining options in the hotel but plenty of moderate price restaurants nearby, including Little Italy and and Fells Point several blocks away. The hotel offers a small continental breakfast for $9.95 or you can order something hot ($14.95) in a smallish breakfast area. They also offer a \"Crabby Hour\" starting at 5:30 with light snacks, wine, and beer complimentary -a nice touch. Parking rates are a bit steep (valet ($32/day) or park yourself ($22/day) in an open lot next to the hotel) but that's the trend for hotels in cities these days.

After that, guests were having a hard time locating bell hops and carts to take their luggage to their rooms. I was told there were only 3 carts for 55 or so rooms. That doesn't make sense. The night shift front desk clerk was completely rude and condescending when we approached him with a door key issue. After issuing us a new key, he walked with us to see if it worked. After he tried it and it was successful, he said \"maybe you shuold learn how to use your key\" in a very demeaning tone as he was walking away. Needless to say, he got an earful and the manager got a call from us at 1:30am at his home to voice our displeasure. A completely unacceptable way to speak to a paying guest in the hospitality industry. I thought maybe a complimentary breakfast or something would have been offrered as an apology, but nothing. Even when we did order room service breakfast the following morning, it arrived cold. We stayed here because I was in a wedding party and the festivities were held at this establishment. Needless to say, I will never stay here again and if I am ever a part of another wedding here, I will walk from an adjacent hotel. The hotel was nice, but the staff was awful.

Why was that not disclosed when speaking to the reservationist PRIOR to making a non-refundable reservation?? Perhaps I would have chosen one of their sister hotels instead. 3) I think that for the charge of $242.00 (before tax, etc.) I think one should find an impeccably clean room...not one with carpeting that did not look vacuumed and a sink that did not look like it had been cleaned/sanitized. I did not complain as I was told at check in that the hotel was booked so I knew there would not be another room to move to. I'm sorry...but I expect a spotless room when I'm paying those prices.

We got back to the room at 6pm and realized that not only had they not made up the room... we obviously had no clean towels. So I called and asked for towels. She said no problem. I called again 40 mins later... still no towels. At that time I also informed them that the toilet wasn't flushing properly and would soon overflow. Another 40 minutes goes by.. no towels, no toilet fixed. I went downstairs and talked to the front desk and asked for towels and maintenance.. she said no problem. Finally at 9pm we decided to go out for dinner and on the way out had to explain that we still have no towels and no working toilet. Upon our return at 11:00, we had a pile of towels thrown on the bathroom counter and the bed was still in shambles. The used glasses were still there... nothing else had been touched.. but the toilet seemed to be working. In addition, we paid $9.95 per day for something.. still not sure what it was.. but it was supposed to include water bottles each day which I never got since our room was never made up. The room itself was fair. It was very dark since outside our window was a brick wall.

We booked a 3 night stay October 8th - 11th. Arrived Friday early evening and were greeted by a cheerful front-end staff, and a happy hour that helped put us in a great mood for the weekend. Our room #204 was a corner suite, with a fantastic view of the harbor. Unfortunately, that's about all the positive to report. Our suite was in desperate need of renovation. The bathroom has less than adequate lighting, and the height of the countertop makes one feel as though you were a professional basketball player (I am just under 6 feet tall). The first evening uncovered a mattress that has seen better days, and an in-wall air conditioning unit that woke us each time it came on throughout the evening. The fact that the AC unit is 3 feet from the bed obviously did not help matters. Breakfast at Pizzazz in the lobby gets a thumbs down. The restaurant lacks organization. Upon seating, we noticed that our tablecloth was dirty. We give credit to the waiter for sensing our displeasure and immediately moving us to another table. Unfortunately, the second was as dirty as the first. Eggs came out of the kitchen, but toaster was on the buffet counter. Coffee urn was empty when we were seated, and took forever to refill (No, it was not crowded). You leave this restaurant feeling awfully confused. If you choose to eat lunch or dinner at one of the restaurants located off the lobby of the hotel, I strongly urge that you confirm your reservation with the restaurant directly. It would be prudent for a hotel to advise their guests if a restaurant will be closed for a private function, which neither the hotel nor the restaurant felt was important when they closed at 4pm Sunday for a wedding reception. Telephone service is horrendous. You have no choice but to dial 0 from your room for any needs. The inadequacy of this phone system was never more apparent than Monday at checkout. We tried for 15 minutes to call for a bellhop. Phone rang, no one answered. Finally we carried 6 bags out to the valet without any assistance from an employee. Save your money.

This was our \"second place\" prize behind a fully paid wedding for 100 people. BIG difference between that prize and what we won, but lets focus on the hotel. Check-in went smoothly and the staff seemed very friendly in the large lobby. The only options for parking were valet parking for $39 or lot/garage parking for $22 per 24 day. We opted for the garage parking which was located across the cul de sac street. Since we won the room and package, we werent sure what kind of room we would receive but found ourselves getting the \"infamous\" room 305. (see previous review a couple of reviews down) The first thing to notice is that we had to use the room key in the elevator to access the third floor. I guess this may be for security reasons, but it could be a hassle when our hands were full, such as coming back with breakfast the next morning. In the room itself, there was an overwhelming smell of baby powder. It didnt bother us too much and we got used to it, but it was definitely noticeable when we first walked in. The room had just the basics...king bed, two phones, flat screen tv (with terrible picture from the standard cable...no HD in this place), a desk and one chair. There was a large empty area over by the A/C that looked like it had room for another table and/or a couple of chairs. The ceiling was very high and there were separate lights in the edge around the room that could be turned on for some \"mood\" lighting. The walls were painted purple and yellow which looked modern and bright. There was no patio, just a railing right outside the door. The view was partially of the harbor, but only at an angle. It was more of a roof view than anything. You could see the giant flag on top of Federal Hill though. The bathroom was basic with Koehler faucets and shower fixtures. The tub had seen some wear and tear, but it wasn't horribly bad. Perhaps if I was paying over $200 for a room I might have been upset. But for our free night, it didnt matter to me. In our room for the Dining & Spa package were the \"Limited Edition\" wine glasses and corkscrew and two mini bottles of wine. The rest of the items were in an envelope given to us at check in which included a map, free drink coupons, a $50 spa or dining voucher, along with a coupon book and the contintental breakfast vouchers from Pizzazz. In my opinion, it really was not worth an upgrade to us. We are not big wine drinkers and most of the drink vouchers and coupons were for places over in Fells Point. With one night on our stay, we didnt even venture over to Fells Point but stayed mainly in along the Harbor. The most negative thing about our trip was that blasted air conditioner. It was LOUD...very LOUD. And, even though we had it set to constant fan, it would shut off for no reason throughtout the night. Then it would be quiet....very quiet. Until the A/C turned on again and then it would get LOUD again. On and off, loud and quiet, all through the night. It was a major distraction. The location of the hotel is great....you cant get any closer to the National Auarium and the Harbor. For the price (we would have paid if we hadnt won the trip), I don't think it is worth it. Also, they automatcially charge $10 for internet service. Our \"free\" trip ended up costing around $100....$16 for internet and taxes as well as $22 for the parking and $60 for dinner at Ruth's Chris. (even with the $50 dining voucher) Do try the Crabby Hour if you go.....free crab cakes or crepes along with drinks.

It is a very nice hotel on the outside and is located right by the Inner Harbor. I have stayed at many hotels around the world and I have to say that this was my worse nights sleep. We had made reservations and asked for a crib to be placed in our room. At check-in yesterday we verified that we should have a crib in our room. They told me they were out of cribs but would have one for us shortly. Fast forward to about 3 hours later and still no crib. Our crib didn't arrive (after 2 phone calls) until after 9 pm. 2 1/2 hours past our babies bed time. We had a room that was facing the front of the hotel right by the Ruth Chris's Steak House. You could actually hear conversations from their outdoor eating area. The walls are paper thin. There was also a band playing on the opposite side of the hotel. They played until after midnight and it was so loud I could hear all the words to the songs. At about midnight our obnoxious neighbors (with a baby and toddler) came back to the room. The walls are so bad we could hear their entire conversation. The rest of the night involved neighbors being loud, their baby screaming, a bug crawling up my pillow, and an ear piercing alarm clock going off at 5 AM. We did get the VIP package which included aquarium tickets and breakfast in the Pizazz restaurant. The breakfast was okay but the staff was very friendly. The valets and reservation hotline people were also very nice. The gentleman at check-out asked how our stay was and I told him the things that had happened. He was nice but didn't really say much about anything. He just told me there were a lot of babies there using cribs. That is fine but when it is 3 hours after you know you need a crib I would expect you would have it ready. Also, it wasn't actually a crib. They just handed us a pack and play at the door. As for the room quality, there were spots on the carpet, sheets, chips of paint off the wall etc. Which is not a big deal if I get a good nights sleep. They really should look into getting more organized and getting some insulation! Also, beware there is no free parking. It costs $35 a night. Also, they add a \"destination\" fee of 9.99 to your room charges.

I should have given the bad reviews more credit. THE GOOD: The valet was very polite, helpful. No problems there. I will say that the hotel charges $32.61. for this service, which I believe to be too expensive to charge guests. The front desk was of low professional caliber (training?) but I believe she was trying to do her best. Location is convenient. THE BAD: Other reviewers have mentioned the paper thin walls. TRUST me! They are not only paper thin - we actually had to be subjected to the guests next door and their \"activities\", all of which we heard and - I KID YOU NOT- made the connecting wall move! I swear. Hubby and I made a joke out of it but, seriously, we've never experienced this anywhere. Can't imagine how shoddy the construction must be for this to happen. Beware of booking (and paying extra dollars for) a harbor view room. We did and were assigned room 304. SEE PHOTO. Having paid extra for this \"view\" and being disappointed to see a view of roof lines and obstructions, we requested a deduct off bill. We were told by front desk to contact the manager, which we did. After explaining the \"view\" to her and being told several times that it IS still a harbor view room, she finally agreed to deduct the additional cost down to a regular room. She was nice and did the right thing but I wish I wouldn't have had to plead my case when it is was so obvious that this room should not be classified as a harbor view room. It really should be taken off that listing and customers should be informed of the obstructions. WiFi is NOT free. There is an additional charge of 9.95 listed as \"destination fee\" that it falls under. I hate these frivolous add-ons. One last thing: Every time the staff answers the phone, they say, \"How can I make magic happen ....\" Not only does this get old, but it is so corny and insincere. Management/Corporate needs to drop this line. It's too easy for it to become a joke.", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cWould Definitely Go Back Again!\u201d", "Author": "Quilter447", "ReviewID": "UR53810062", "Content": "This is the first time my husband and I stayed at the Pier 5 Hotel and we would definitely go back again.

When I arrived on an 85 degree day, my room had no air on and had an unbearable musty smell. I asked if I could switch to another room, and neither of the women at the front desk seemed to know how to accommodate my request. One told me there was nothing they could do about it, and the other seemed completely flustered as though she had never encountered this situation before. I did switch rooms, and the second room still had no air on when I arrived, but no musty smell. Other minor complaints... the sheets felt starchy and rough (this might be a major complaint for someone who cares more about having soft linens) and not only is there no option to re-use your bath towels, but they actually replaced my bar of soap each day (i.e., not just left a new one, but actually threw out a perfectly good bar of soap that had been used once). However, the worst thing about my stay at Pier V was the unpleasant surprise at checkout (no bill left under my door, also... had to go downstairs and request one) that I had been charged a $9.95 daily \"Destination Fee\" in addition to my room rate. This fee covers amenities such as bottled water in the room (which I never drank) and happy hour (which I never went to). It seems outrageous to me to charge guests for unused amenities.

I've heard alot about the noise in the hotel and I can't honestly remember ever being bothered by it, however, it does have 2 event spaces for weddings and other party events so I can understand the noise.

My husband and I were extremely disappointed with the hotel. I had asked for an early check in and when we arrived at 1pm, we were told the room was \"almost\" ready, we could leave our bags, and they would call me on my cell phone when the room was ready. When we returned to the hotel at 5pm, I still had not received a call stating my room was ready. We got back to the hotel and the front desk stated the room was ready and they \u201cforgot\u201d to call me. I should mention that the couple in front of us received a room with a bed not fully made because the pillowcases were not finished washing (its 5pm \u2013 most hotels have the rooms ready by 3pm) so I\u2019m not sure when the room actually became ready. We got up to our room and were sure we had the wrong room. I had been excited because I believed we were getting a two room suite. I had ordered the Grand Clause Sleeping room believing from the website that this was the Grand Clause Suite but the front desk informed me when I came downstairs that I had the correct room and that the Grand Clause Sleeping Room was in fact a Traditional King room. What I can\u2019t figure out is why they have two options when selecting your room on the website \u2013 The grand clause sleeping room and the traditional king to pick from and why the description isn\u2019t clearer. The website was misleading and it was not clear that the Grand Clause Suite and the Grand Clause Sleeping room were \u201cdifferent\u201d. There were three of us and we definitely would not have stayed at this hotel or ordered a traditional king sized room if we had known that the Grand Clause Sleeping room was the same as a traditional king room \u2013 we thought we were getting a suite. Needless to say the front desk people did not care and had no other options for us even though there was practically no-one staying there. They stated the manager on duty would call me the next day (why not right then to discuss) which he or she did not. To date, I have not been contacted. My husband and I wanted to make the best of it so we were going to try to enjoy our night there but the hotel just sucked. The vending machines were out of soda and when I asked about room service (they have two connected restaurants), I was told they don\u2019t use either one and that I could order form Mo\u2019s Restaurant but I needed a $30 minimum order in order for them to deliver to my room.

I booked online with the 14 Day Advanced HM Magic Package. Others have written that there was an activity fee and things that you don't get when reserving online and that was what I got. Though they let you know this when you check in. Others have written that when checking in that the front desk doesn't seem to know that you even had a reservation with them. I faced the same thing, but they had no problem putting the reservation in right there and then. I was in room 208. This was a two double bed room with a view. When I reserved online, they had asked if I had any requests that they couldn't guarentee, but would try to get for me. I had requested a balcony and got the request. I have posted pictures of the room. Others also have written that the walls are paper thin and they are correct. My room had a door that I would assume that they use as a connecting room type of thing, but for me wasn't necessary and was kept locked. I did have people in the next room that I could hear their conversations as well I'm sure they could hear mine. I would definitely suggest that the hotel do something about that. You needed a security card to get to your floor and room. I also stayed at the Peabody for a night and while with the Peabody the card you used was needed for the elevator, at the Pier V hotel you need it for your floor. There are doors on your floor that you need to go through to get to your room. The only way to access the door is through a security key. This was fine for me. I had a view directly across from the Aquarium. They did offer the crab event that others have mentioned, but unfortunately I did not have the time to take the offer. The hotel sent me a survey, that I intend to fill out, via my email. They asked if everything was alright. I had visitors who were coming to visit that did not know which room I was in. I had the front desk call my room if they asked for me. I had pizza delivery. Any services or questions that I had were taken care of. It wasn't a ritzy hotel with pampering and fluff, but it was a nice hotel. I am familiar with the Baltimore area and grew up in and around the area. It is located conveniently right by the water on the Aquarium, Little Italy, Fells Point, Canton, etc. side of the Inner Harbor. It is a little farther away from the ballpark/stadium side of the Inner Harbor. Though the hotel does offer valet parking, I knew I was going to be using my car frequently so I parked at the Pier V parking garage that is next door to the hotel. It would be cheaper for those who are not parking their car there for long or overnight. It was also convenient because the garage has a system that you can access your car at any time of the day or night. There are some garages that close and you are not able to access your vehicle until the next day when they open. I had not written this before, but when I lived in Baltimore I would take trips out of state and leave my car parked in a garage. On one of these trips I needed to get a cab to a bus terminal. It was raining and too early in the morning to flag down a cab around town so I happen to walk by the Pier V hotel. They had someone working out in front of the hotel and I asked if it would be alright if I could get them to call me a cab. They did and even let me wait in the lobby for it. It saved me a tedious trek around to find a place where I could find a taxi at that time of the morning and was amazing to me that they would even bother especially since I was not a guest staying at the hotel at the time.

Hotel-- First, the hotel was clean and comfortable and has a evry interesting look, and the staff was very helpful and accomodating. They had a nice crabby hour where you can sample a nice crab dip and have wine, beer or soda. My complaints were 1) that our tv remote didnt work,and we called 3 times to ask that someone fix it, but it was not addressed until the last night of our stay. 2) the cleaning service was not good, ie we would see wrappers/debris still scattered on the floor after the room was \"cleaned\"., 3) the room we were given only had one bed, EVEN THOUGH WE TOLD THEM WE WERE A FAMILY OF FOUR AND WANTED TWO DOUBLES. (After complaining at the front desk, they bought in an air mattress but I was still kind of irritated by this. The kids were fine with it though). BE FOREWARNED: there are big $$$ tax and occumpacy fees. We payed nearly $60 on tax and fees PER NIGHT..Ask about the costs of these to avoid any unpleasnt surprises...Plus PARKING IS $21 PER DAY. No free parking options available. Factor this into your budget. Hotel Breakfast passes -- The food was good, the service, not so good. On day one, there was s a long wait because the place seems understaffed. The next day, it was better, no doubt because of complaints. BE FOREWARNED: Go early (before 9) or expect a good wait. Activities-- The package came with 3 museum tickets. Ypu can buy extra tix in advance. The kids had a nice time (they are 8 and 5), but they were only entertained for about 2 hours. They loved the jungle gym - that's the main attraction.The rest was not that interesting too them.... We also purchased (in advance) tickets to the Acquarium. This was a bit of a disappointment. BE FOREWARNED: The 3D showed scared my children. If you have small children, SIT NEAR THE AISLE SO YOU CAN LEAVE EARLY IF NEEDED. The dolphin show was nice but over so fast you hardly felt you saw any tricks. GET THERE AT LEAST 15 minutes early if you want a good seat. Also, if you go to the acquarium on a Saturday, there is a long line, so if you are sure you want to go, buy tix in advance to avoid the line.). Lastly, we also purchased (in advance) ESPN zone tickets. This was okay as well, but really the games are geared to older kids than mine so we didnt get much benefit out of it. BE FOREWARNED: DONT buy tix in advance because they are pretty easy to get once you are there, and if you dont use them they are NOT refundable.

No issues with getting a bite to eat or a drink. There is a Panera about 2 blocks away and has great Breakfast and Lunch options.

Here's why: First, they tout their \"complimentary\" In-Hotel activities that you are charged $10 per night for. Someone ought to give them a dictionary and show them that the word \"complimentary\" means \"costing nothing\". You are charged a fee for phone and internet use even though you don't use the phone. Go figure. We came back to our room one day around 4pm and noticed that we didn't have bath towels.... they said we had to wait until they came out of the laundry. You think maybe they'd have enough towels to have one handy when you want to take a shower. So, that took a while to get towels when we really wanted to shower. Little things like not replacing the empty tissue box. Also, a little thing like a mouse that scampered into the room on the last morning. (I think they charged us for it, too). There is no gym or workout room. But we were told that the sister hotel several blocks away had a gym that we were welcome to use. I'm surprised they didn't send us to the Marriot to use the toilets there. Possibly the worst part was every night of the weekend, there was a large party taking place in the lobby and side rooms. One was a wedding party, the next night it was some Hindu wedding with loud music and the next night it was a black fashion show..... complete with thumping, loud music until 11pm. On the day we left, we had to get a cab to the airport at 5:30am so we asked for a wake-up call that never came. Fortunately, we set our own alarm clock or else we probably would have missed our flight. Had enough?

We were greated warmly and provided with our room two hours before the published check-in time. We were impressed with the fact that the hallway to our room was accessible only by the room key, limiting hallway foot traffic. The hotel location was wonderful. Short walks (15 - 20 minutes at a reasonable pace) to the Inner Harbor shops and restaurants and to the Power Plant Live entertainment complex. The complimentary shuttle between the Pier 5 and the Admiral Fell Inn was also appreciated. The rooms were large and nicely furnished and the bed was quite comfortable, although the wallpaper in our bathroom was peeling and in need of scrubbing. Be advised that the pictures of the hotel exterior suggests that there are small terraces off some of the rooms; we had one such room and realized it was not a small terrace but simply a decorative iron rail to keep one from falling out when opening the patio door. It was nice, though, to open the door and hear the sights and sounds of the harbor while we were in the room. All of the good, unfortunately, was overshadowed by the problems we experienced. The website advertised a promotional offer for a $20 gas card but, upon inquiring at the hotel, we were told that that offer had expired before we even made our reservation. We had also signed up for free membership in the Harbor Magic Club, advertised on their web site, prior to reserving our room. The membership entitles us to a $50 voucher to be used for a future visit. It has been six weeks since our stay and I have not yet received this voucher; I sent email a few days ago but have not yet had a response. These two perks, valued at $70, were a contributing factor in our decision to stay at the Pier 5 rather than the Renaissance, where we have stayed in the past and highly recommend. Most frustrating, though, was an experience similar to that experienced by the writer who stayed here the weekend of the Miss USA pageant. NOISE!!! A bat mitzvah was being held in a banquet facility located off the lobby and, as the other writer noted, the event spilled over into the lobby. The doors to the banquet facility were left open and we could hear not only the music but also the shrieks and squeals of teenagers as if they were right outside our door - which, truth be told, they almost were since the hallway outside our room looked directly into the lobby. This was certainly not an environment conducive to an anniversary getaway. The event ended shortly after midnight - about two hours later than one would think reasonable given the inadequate accommodations for such an event. I did receive an apology when I inquired at the desk as to the scheduled end of the event, although it was given in such a way that I am quite certain I was not the only guest to receive one that evening. I did not, though, receive what I feel would have been a more appropriate 'Harbor Magic' gesture, though - like complimentary drink vouchers we could have used when we left and waited it out at a nearby bar. I received an emailed survey after our visit, inquiring as to the satisfaction of our stay. I responded with a similar level of detail to that which I post here but, again, no response at all. I would be happy to give the Pier 5 another chance (although not for an anniversary getaway) - if, that is, I receive the expected $20 gas card and $50 future visit voucher.

The staff always went above and beyond. We flew in early and were able to check in to our room at 9:30 AM! Amazing! We were expecting to have to store our luggage! We had a double queen room. The beds were wonderful! Warning to those staying for more than a day or two...THERE ARE NO DRESSERS. The closet was a bit small, but the room was huge! There was a desk in our room, in between the beds instead of a nightstand. They provide a fridge (not stocked), hairdryer, toiletries are good, and even umbrellas for the days it rains.

The roof of the atrium is glass, so when it rains hard, they get a few leaks in the lobby. There are three eateries attached, a breakfast/lunch cafe with okay food but wonderful staff, a seafood place which was FABULOUS, and a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. They are currently offering an aquarium VIP package- only pay extra for this if you will be going to the aquarium on the weekend. Without it, you WILL have to stand in line, and will be given a time to COME BACK to get in. The aquarium is VERY popular on weekends! There's virtually no lines on weekdays however, except for holidays. There are several cute and comfy couches in the lobby for meeting and talking with people, as long as there isn't a reception. The hotel is the next pier over from the mammal pavillion of the aquarium, and our room looked right into the dolphin theatre!

Breakfast the next morning in the hotel's cafe was delicious.

The hotel is non smoking, very much needed, we have a daughter with special needs and respitory problems. Walked into the room and smelled cig. smoke. Told the front desk, the room was aired out and respaced the filter. The smell was gone but I worried about the air quality. THe view was not good, balconies are bars on the sliding glass door. Not a balcony in my book. The room was dirty, rug was stained, not vacuumed either. The bathroom was dirty, tub had pink growth around drain, bottom had a slip guard thing which had black dirt marks, needed to be replaced, floor was dirty in bathroom even had someone elses pubic hair, yuk. It was very hard to wash my girls and just felt gross. The hallway had a leak in the ceiling dripping down most of the day, next morning still dripping tried to walk around with flip-flops on, the carpet was sooo wet , my feet got wet, gross. The room was large which was nice but with the other problems just was not worth the money and really put a damper on our vacation. First time on a vacation that arriving home to a clean bathroom made me appreciate being home. Just not worth the $$$ for this hotel. Oh we booked thru myleisuretravel.com. The staff was nice but didn't seem like they had to much control over the facility. Nothing magical about this vacation, extra fees they don't tell you about get tacked on too, connective fee we never even used but everyone must pay. Oh and two of the resturants on different days had the air condition out. Not good in 90 degree weather. If we ever go again, we will check out the hotels that surrounded the area. We would never stay here again.", "Date": "July 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Blend of Convenience, Whimsy and Comfort\u201d", "Author": "tdpndc", "ReviewID": "UR3702960", "Content": "The Inner Harbor location is one of the best.

The website reservation form said \"Harbor View.\" In our room, a brick wall faced the harbor, and our window faced other rooms! We asked to change rooms and they said they would get back to us, but never did. The heater was a cheap electric room unit: noisy but still left the room cold. The bathroom was like something out of a cheap $29 motel. They also tried to tack on a bogus $5 \"connectivity fee\" that was never listed in the internet price. The only positives were the full box of Godiva chocolates, and a good breakfast, but those didn't justify the extremely high price.

Not what I expected for hotel in that location. Bell hop made me a little nervous because she was hovering over my luggage even while I was checking in. She waited for me to be checked in, which took a long time. Took me a while to check in because only one person was working the front desk. Room was okay, same thing you will find in a Motel 6 in the middle of nowhere. No wash cloths in the room. Comforter, which was a bit old, smelled of a distinct cologne but I was too tired to complain but the thought of someone lying on that bed just before I came in bothered me. That connectivity charge was not necessary. Can't even charge to my room from the restaurant where I had breakfast. Had to go up to my room to grab my credit card.

When we walked in, we thoght the decor was a bit gaudy, but hey, we can be flexible. The one positive thing I can say is that a couplel of the staff members were very nice. Not nice enough to make up for a shoddy hotel, but it's important to acknowledge the positive. And now to acknowledge the negative . . . How about they lost our reservation? And instead of resolving the matter, they had US get on the phone and speak with the booking agent. After finally being found, our room was not ready until after 4 pm. Ridiculous! Once we arrived in the room, I attempted to turn on the TV. Before I could turn it on however, the heavy sliding door on the TV chest FELL ON ME. Upon closer inspection, it was obvious why it fell on me . . . there was no hinge. This was a completely reckless, foreseeable thing, and the injury that I sustained was entirely avoidable had the hotel bothered to make sure that the room was habitable before releasing it. To top off a horrible stay: the front desk staff said it was fine for us to check-out an hour late because our room was not ready on time. Apparently this was not communicated to the cleaning woman, who barged into our room and asked when we would be leaving b/c she needed to clean up. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, our room turned into a 3-ring circus as I tried to explain to the woman that the appropriate thing to do would be to call rather than barge in. Luckily, we were in the process of packing up, but what if I had been coming out of the shower? I filed an incident report with the hotel, and even then have not heard from a manager. It is a shame that some establishments will only improve their services based on legal action taken by customers.
