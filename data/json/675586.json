Unfortunately, I was unable to make my stay at their hotel for my trip to London due to some customs/tickets issues when travelling from France to the UK. It was a Sunday morning and as soon as I found out I was not able to go, I called the Chester Hotel and spoke to Alli regarding a refund for my two booked nights. As a courtesy, they were able to refund only one night (Monday) and charge me for the Sunday night reservation (since it was within a 3 day cancellation policy). Alli said that he would speak to his Manager on Monday and see if they are able to refund Sunday night as well due to the special circumstance I had with my tickets. Monday came, and I called again and spoke with Alli. He remembered me right away and said he is waiting for his manager to come in so that he can speak with him regarding my situation. Several hours later, I get a phone call and it is Alli. He he advised me that his Manager approved the refund and that all money has been returned. I'm in SAles and customer service is an absolute must!! I am extremely satisfied with the service that was given to me! Not even staying there, I give this place a 5+ because of the great service. The next time I plan a trip to the UK I will come back and try my stay here at Chester. Thank you Alli and your Manager for such great service! I will recommned you to all who is visiting London! On a side note, we chose this hotel becasue of the great location!

The location was fairly good but it pretty much stops there. The room was bright and not badly decorated but it was small and the bathroom was not a luxury tiled bathroom as advertised but a plastic cubical/pod that was ridiculous in size. The shower didnt work properly and was literally over the toilet and there was no toilet roll on arrival and no towels on the second night. We are down to earth people and were quite happy with the room and also happy with the small details of the misleading pictures of the bathroom, we actually laughed it off given that we didnt pay a through the nose but it was the staff's attitudes that spoilt our trip. I dont expect anything special but even just to be civil would have made all the difference. We arrived an hour early and approached the desk where i was called mr neil three times (Its miss O'Neill). I corrected him several times stating the booking was in my name to which he said i had not made a booking. Then i showed confirmation and i was told that i only had a room for one night. I had actually booked for 3. Once this was dealt with he asked the maid if the room was ready and she clearly said \"yes\" but he said we were to early and would have to come back in an hour. We asked could we leave our cases and he was tutting and sighing about this and just pointed to a corner by some stairs. Even then we didnt think much of it and were glad to just be there and off load our cases. We attempted to get our coats out of the cases due to there being a thunder storm outside and our money and he stood over us while we were doing this saying \"just leave them there\" and sighing like it was a major issue. After the third time of saying it, i became quite pressured and offended and had to look up at him and say \"we are just getting some money and our coats as its raining outside, is that okay\". He backed off a little then. We tried to forget this first impression and eventually got back soaked through in an hours time and was looking forward to seeing our room and getting dried off. Again the staff were rude and it was someone else at the desk who proceeded to call me mr neil and again said there was no booking made for a miss o'neill, then eventually found my booking details and again said i had booked for one night. We finally just got a key handed to us but no directions to our room. The lack of hospitality was unreal and we felt deflated and uncomfortable. We had to go down and ask for toilet roll to which the male member off staff was huffing and puffing and just shouted to the house keeper who passed us one with no expression, just didnt even speak. The second night we asked for towels as we had none at all in our room. The same house keeper just mumbled something in polish pulling faces and passed over 'one' hand towel. We had to say that there was two of us staying and we needed bath towels for a shower. Again she mumbled something in her own language and reluctantly passed two towels over. We went for a romantic trip and ended up being upset and annoyed by the treatment of the staff. After coming home i had wished that i had said something at the time but i just didnt want to ruin our trip and have to dread returning to the hotel in the evenings. We asked could we leave our bag on our departure day for two hours as we were told when booking that this wouldnt be a problem but the member of staff looked disgusted at us and just kept repeating how long for? he must have asked us four times and then shouted after us on our way out the door ..................... \"just two hours\". Again i was upset by this and pretended to my partner that i didnt hear what he said for fear of him having a row with him as i could see he was really wound up by the poor service at this time, as i was. On our return for our bags they actually just ignored us like they couldnt even see us. No good bye, no thanks for staying, no general hospitality. I had some shoes stolen from our room during our stay which i didnt realise until i unpacked my bag after my return. I had just presumed that my partner had packed them away as we didnt trust the staff while we were there so we left everything in the case during the day time and locked the case only leaving a few items out such as jackets and shoes. Utterly shocking really and im just glad we didnt leave the case open or unpack our belongings, also that the shoes were not too expensive. We had a lovely trip but would never stay there again unless the management had changed hands. I tried to put it down to their lack of English at the time and we were convincing each other that they may have been acting appropriately for a hotel owner in their culture/country but at the end of the day, this is England and i have never been treated like that in any of the many hotels that i have stayed in before. It saddens me to think that people may travel from all different parts of the world to the capital of our country and be treated and greeted by such disappointing attitudes.

The room was very small, the bed too (maybe for one person and a half). It was not very very clean and some things should have been fixed.

I was charged \u00c2\u00a320 (plus \u00c2\u00a33 booking fee) for what was described as a \"box room\" - basically a small-ish room with single bed, sink, tea making facilities and a shared toilet/bathroom. And I have to say, for \u00c2\u00a320 I found it exceptionally good value. I can see why other reviewers may have had problems with the hotel - the decor is tired and in desperate need of new carpets and a fresh lick of paint. The owner was friendly enough when I first arrived, but clearly more interested in the TV show he was watching than customer care. However, for \u00c2\u00a320 in central London, these complaints seem pretty minor! The room was clean, bedsheets and towel clean, despite the grubby looking, worn carpet and markings on the paintwork. Minor things, really, as the room was larger than I expected, with plenty of room to move about and hang up clothes. There was a TV in the room (which I didn't use). Flaws were that the sink was ridiculously small and \"designer\" and the shared toilet a couple of floors down in the basement. However, that was also very clean and had obviously been mopped that morning and a cleaner was hard at work when I arrived. The location is exceptionally convenient - only 5 minutes work from Victoria Station. You couldn't ask for better. Lots of nice bars and restaurants in the area too and the street was relatively quiet for central London. But the main advantage was the price. If I'd paid a lot for the room I would have been expecting more, but as a convenient place to crash for one night when in London, I couldn't have asked for more. It was a steal on LateRooms.

Let me start, well I arrived in London from Berkshire with my fianc\u00c3\u00a9; he had brought last minute tickets to see Wicked in the weekend so we wanted a hotel close by. When I googled there were a few that came up but this was the only one with rooms available so I called and booked after checking out the website which by the way is a complete misguided view, but for the price i paid, well I was at least expecting something half decent. What did I get though; something entirely different. I won't waffle on, We stayed for 1 night but in that night I was moved to 3 different rooms, once woken up whilst we were sleeping as there had been a mistake and I should have been in another room. Well all 3 rooms were disgusting, 2 had en-suites or cupboards with showers in them I would prefer to describe it as. The showers had no hot water, that was my fault as I was apparently told that there would be hot water only from 7am to 8am only. The carpets were rotten and smelt of mould and the mattresses were sagging and squeaky. I was almost relieved to see clean sheets, although this didn't make me feel any better. The ceilings had damp in corners and I was afraid it would cave in at any point. And the smell in the toilet made me think nobody had cleaned it in years, I don't even know how to describe the stench, I felt sick. Lastly the service, it was the worst part of my experience, I got shouted at by two men that could barely speak English just for asking for something clearly within my rights. When I demanded to speak to somebody who could speak English, I had to wait until 2pm, 4 hours after I'd checked out but I was determined to get a refund so I stayed and missed my train. Well when the young man turned up, who I can only assume is a family member of the owner, well he barely said a thing to me except he could not refund me or give me any money back and then he just ignored me until k got fed up and left. I am warning everyone, please do not stay here. Quite frankly, I have stayed in travellers hostels abroad better than this back in the 90's when I travelled eastern Asia as a student, that's saying something. The only other guest I met there during my stay was as angry as me but could barely speak any English so got treated worse than I had. The room I was kicked out from was occupied by one of the 2 members of staff and his girlfriend where they'd had sex very loudly, I heard the entire session and was quite embarrassed to say the least.

The staff were immensely unhelpful with absolutely no idea of how to speak to a customer. The hotel itself was shabby and poorly decorated. When I arrived, the hotel was in a state with duvets and sheets just lying in the hallway (clearly they were cleaning up) and this was all removed later on - still not a good start! The 'reception' was a room in the basement where a man sat in a smoke filled and disgustingly messy room. My room was actually not badly decorated but was small. It was probably their best room and it was newly decorated (the only positive thing I have to say might I add). Even the shower and the bathroom was decent (newly decorated) and clean - I thank my lucky stars that I booked the en-suite as the shared toilet and bathroom were atrocious - unclean, unhygienic and just plain DIRTY! The room was advertised as having internet broadband access - BUT IT DID NOT. I had a very poor signal. When I complained the receptionist could do nothing and said that I could sit out on the stairs where the signal was 'excellent'. I payed for a room with internet access not to sit out outside my room to use the wifi - and I should add that I refused to pay the additional fee for internet and the receptionist did not budge or waive the fee despite the access being unavailable in the room! I was desperate to use the internet so coughed up the money unwillingly. Weird noises came from the room periodically (from the heating system). In most hotels, you will find a bible or equivalent in a drawer - what did I find? An 'Adult Guide' to London in the drawer!! What a confused place! ALL IN ALL VERY POOR - STAY AWAY!!", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "woking", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here\u201d", "Author": "jwalkerphd", "ReviewID": "UR18240262", "Content": "This hotel is terrible. I arrived to find a team of 'craftsmen' repainting the halls of the hotel and the rooms of the hotel. It was chaos. I was given a hideous room in the basement and when I complained they did give me a slightly better one higher up but it was still awful. This allowed a splendid view of the back yard (as seen in the photos on another review) which was full of junk. There seemed to be no Fire Escape signs or fire extinguishers. Hideous shower, kettle with cups but no tea. I didn't stay and they wouldn't refund me. The staff where not as hostile as mentioned in other reviews and seemd quite friendly or just embarassed. Don't book this hotel and if you do, don't pay in advance as you won't get it back. Why are us poor visitors to London meant to feel grateful if we only pay \u00c2\u00a346.00 for a crappy room, this would get you a nice room in many other capitals, I don't know why the government or the tourist office can't stop hotels ripping people off.

The room itself was very small but that was understandable for a back street hotel in central London. However, the sheets were washed but still stained!! We decided to unbutton the duvet and remove the pillow case which left us in utter shock, both had patches of grey and various stains. The walls were damp and parts were peeling and the ensuite was equivalent of a porta-loo with a shower of course. We eventually got our room changed but the new one wasn't much better. Quite simply, if you are looking for a hotel in the right location and are not bothered about cleansiness or comfort then this is the place to be as it is right in the heart of London with many shops, restaurants and travel facilities nearby.
