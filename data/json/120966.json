Unfortunately, neither happened. First the good: I love the building. I love the location. I think the room was clean-tiny (no chairs, only bed to sit on), but serviceable for the price and location. Now the bad: We stayed in room 12 which is right next to the lobby. The door doesn't fit properly in the frame so there are gaps all around the door. This means you hear Every. Single. Thing that goes on in the lobby. All the people entering and leaving. Also, the lobby is the primary way for people to get to their rooms on the second floor so the entering and leaving is pretty non-stop. The door slams. The guests weren't being obnoxious or anything, it's just that between the ill-fitting door with gaps and no soundproofing, you can hear EVERYTHING. I'm assuming anyone on the other side of our door could clearly hear what we were doing,too. Ummm, creepy. Remember the owner's comments below about the microwave, coffeepot, umbrellas, etc being in the lobby? Well, it's true. I know this because I heard all the other guests getting stuff in the lobby. I heard them talking in the lobby. Making coffee (and smelling it--we don't drink coffee so this was obnoxious to me and woke both of us up). The beeping of the microwave every 30 seconds. The CONSTANT screen door opening and shutting. OMG! Horrible. This went on for all but a brief period during the night. It started back up again around 5:30 am. Incidentally, I'm not a particularly light sleeper not do I expect silence. But this was ridiculous. Also, when I went into the room (which consisted of a bed and wall-mounted tv, dresser--again, small but adequate). I noticed the wall directly across from the bed was almost entirely windows with wood blinds. Great, I thought. Indirect sunlight. So I open the blinds and that's when I realized that on the other side of the window is the porch with rockers! With lots of people rocking! Oh yeah, the early-risers really enjoyed watching the sunrise from that porch. I know because I heard them talking about it. Finally, and this is small, but significant. For some unknown reason, the owners put a tiny little ledge above the bed. I'm guessing it is supposed to be some type of decoration--def not a headboard. No padding or anything. The significant part: when you sit up in bed, it is at the absolute perfect height for you to hit your head. Trust me on this one. The bottom line is that the other rooms could be fine. Room 12 is not. I was stuck in a room with an unfitted, definitely NOT sound-proofed door that had a lobby/kitchen/meeting place directly on the other side of an ill-fitting door and a huge set of window that had a popular porch on the other. Finally, the bathroom shower is tiny--no tub and definitely only one person could fit in that thing. Again, adequate, but just thought I'd share. Would I stay here again? Possibly, but ONLY if I didn't stay in room 12. I also want to experience the large room and peace and quiet the other reviewers got to experience.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staten Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cBest vacation ever... 2 years running!\u201d", "Author": "Spanky0779", "ReviewID": "UR136655426", "Content": "Absolutely love the Beach Walk!

I stay in July '10 and it was our first trip to Ocean City MD being from Jersey, of course I have always frequented those shores. But I was told that OC MD is really fun and way cheaper! Well it is.... cheaper. The hotel is great but the city is a bit rowdy for my taste. I never felt unsafe or anything, but if any one is familiar with jersey shores its more like the center of Wildwood than Ocean City NJ. With that said if you are vacationing in OC MD and are looking for a quiet CLEAN hotel than Beach Walk is your place. Is it steps to the beach and boardwalk, right at the end of the ramp. You can see the ocean from the front pourches, very nice! The rooms are extremely clean, which is very important to me. They are not very fancy, but don't look bad at all, nice, organized and modern. They are on the smaller side, but not too small. I shared a room with me, my husband, and 6 month old and it was comfortable. This is a family location, but not for partying teenagers. They owners do not want that, and never do I! We had a pleasant stay and no problems. The owners, are very nice people. Some have written that they are gruff, but I found the opposite to be sure. Very nice, and personable. If you have problems with them, you probably were the problem. I can see that the wife could be mistaken as curt, but that's my type of woman, you have to be to run a hotel that nicely. The only down side is the parking. Although free, several blocks away. But my husband and I are in our late twenties and early thirties, so the walk did not bother us and we even had a 6 month old and stroller in toe!

The first time was five years ago and we really enjoyed our stay then. We tried to book the Beach Walk every time we visited OC but most of our trips were last minute so the hotel was already booked. The location is fabulous; the second house right off the boardwalk on 10th street! The beach is huge so there is no problem getting a good spot on the beach \u2013 just go early if you prefer to be closest to the water. Everything we did was in walking distance for us. Although we could have utilized the tram on the boardwalk or the bus that takes you up and down OC for $2/day. The hotel itself is older and looks like a classic beach house to me. Nice porches with rocking chairs to lounge on and watch the ocean or people walking by. The owners due a fantastic job of keeping the unruly people away. We were on the third floor and there is no elevator but this was not an issue for us. Our room consisted of two-queen beds (one was in its own separate room, no outside access) mini fridge, microwave, two dressers, two TV\u2019s, nightstands, and two AC window units. There were no actual seats in the room. Space was fine for the three of us on vacation (all adults). The bathroom consisted of a shower stall (the ladies had some trouble shaving their legs) a toilet and sink. The bathroom size was adequate for us. The only issue we had was the towel rack was missing \u2013 we assumed it was broken but unfortunately never replaced, as there was a space for it on the wall. The bathroom did not have its own AC window unit so the door had to be kept open to keep it cool. Beds were fine but a bit softer then we all preferred. The room was clean and probably painted in the off-season. There was very little d\u00e9cor but we weren\u2019t there to stare at the walls of a hotel room! There were two outdoor showers as well. I used one of them twice while we stayed there. Water pressure and temperature were both fine. However, since the showers never really had any direct sunlight, I could see moldy spots in the shower. Parking for the hotel was across Baltimore Ave and Philadelphia Ave and up to 12th street. So it was nice walk to get the car but then again we never really needed it due to the location of the hotel. If you are lucky, there is some free parking right outside of the hotel, but they fill up fast! The hotel also had coffee available in the morning and offered free use of beach umbrellas! For our trip, this hotel was again perfect. Comfortable, great location and very affordable! We will definitely be back!

This is a small family-owned and -operated hotel. The rooms are eclectic and not a full-service hotel but has everything we needed to have a great vacation with extended family. We rented 5 rooms for a family get-together. We chose Ocean City because it is between Virginia and Pennsylvania where much of the family lives, and we chose Beach Walk Hotel because of the reviews on TripAdvisor.com that the rooms are clean and a good value. This is definitely true. The hotel is on a side street, one building off of the boardwalk. We all agreed that the location is perfect because we were away from the heat and hubub of the boardwalk, but still had a very good view of the beach. We spent many hours on the porch visiting with each other between trips to the beach or boardwalk. The position of the porch is perfect to catch breezes from the ocean or bay. The rooms with 2 beds are by far more comfortable. There is plenty of space in the 2-bed rooms, with a small kitchen sink and refrigerator and small dining table with folding chairs. One of the 2-bed rooms had the beds in 2 separate rooms with a door between them. The 1-bed rooms are small but perfect for single guests or kids (we placed an air matress on the floor). Negatives are that there is no elevator, and all rooms are on the 2nd and 3rd foors (the owner lives on the 1st floor). You have to carry everything up the exterior stairs. We have a couple of people with knee problems, and they struggled with negotiating the stairs. Also, the beds could be a little more comfortable. I am accustomed to Comfort Inn or Hampton Inn beds, and these beds are firm but cheaply made, probably comparable to a Motel 6. Also, parking can be a problem. As the owner explains when you book the room, there are only a few free spots on the street in front of the hotel. Otherwise, the owner provides free parking passes for a lot 3 blocks away. Parking is at a premium everywhere around the beach (and expensive), but you can keep your car in the free parking and take the bus which is only $2 to ride all day. Beach Walk Hotel is very clean and well maintained. The cost made the trip affordable for all extended family members to participate, especially since we could bring our own food and drinks. In summary, the Beach Walk Hotel is a great value for a small family or extended family, with easy access to the beach and boardwalk to keep everyone entertained.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay on the cheap, as close as you can get to the beach without being on the boardwalk.\u201d", "Author": "stephandtim", "ReviewID": "UR46325422", "Content": "Stayed at the Beach Walk Hotel for a one-day causal anniversary trip.

It is the second building from the boardwalk which means it doesnt face it but you can see it from the hotels front porches that feature chairs. The managment is on site. The owners ( a husband and wife - although you deal with the wife) live on site. They take up the first floor of the three story hotel so if you need something you can ask them. Then the bad: There are no elevators and so you will have to walk up stairs that are outside with your bags. The rooms and the lobby are on the 2nd and 3rd floors because the owners live on the first floor. Many of the hotels in Ocecan City and even on the boardwalk feature on site parking. This is not one of them. There is a parking lot that is located 3 blocks away (across a very busy road). Another option though is on street parking. There are some spaces in the city that you do not have to pay for and can park for days on end and are very safe which I used my entire stay. I was able to find spaces three times. Since the hotel does not face the boardwalk the side of the hotel has views of the boardwalk. The boardwalk area is very dense so there is another row of buildings between the hotel and the boardwalk so room views arent that great.
