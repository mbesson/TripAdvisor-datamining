I was quite nervous as to which hotel I would choose, as I had no expreience with any, nor did I know any locals. So, quite randomly I had decided on Hotel Manfredi. Firstly, don't let the hotel front put you off. The taxi had dropped us off in a tiny street, to what had appeared to be 'Hotel Forte.' After a minute's lookaround, I had realised that Hotel Manfredi was located in the same building, but on the 3rd floor (Hotel Forter, with the bigger sign, was on the 1st Floor). The entrance you probably see in photos is the hotel front, but on the 3rd floor. After such a surprise, I was quite nervous with what I had gotten myself into. So, into the charming European lift towards the 3rd floor, and now Hotel Manfredi is clearly marked. Immediately, the worker there was welcoming, and did not hesitate to try his English (by the way, it was perfectly good!). After check in, we were introduced into our various rooms. The rooms were small'ish, with minimal light, but to very good spec, particularly the clean albeit tight washrooms. Mind you, this is a very old city, and at a hotel that doesn't cost you an arm and a leg. The room was charming (not a euphemism), the Wifi was consistent, and the hotel as a whole was very quite. I couldn't have been more pleased. Given that Italians don't really do breakfast (a la English/American 'meals'), it was great that the hotel offered such food. Though I was more than willing to adapt to the continental lifestyle, my elderly parents couldn't be blamed for wanting the breakfasts they're used to. In terms of the location, it was fantastic. Literally a stone's throw from the Spanish Steps, and a handful of high-label design shops (Gucci, Prada, Bulgari, etc), with about a 5 minute walk to more casual shopping. Rome itself isn't all too big, and this hotel is situated at about the top-middle of the touristic activity. For our longer outings, a taxi queue was literally 3 minutes away (facing the Spanish Steps). I'd have zero hesitation in returning to this hotel should I find myself in Rome again. I'd say for business, perhaps not the most suitable, but for personal holiday and romantic getaways, this is a deal to be had!", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique hotel with fantastic location - 3 star but feels like 4 star\u201d", "Author": "JoshS_London", "ReviewID": "UR116839752", "Content": "We were really pleasantly surprised by Hotel Manfredi.

After several calls over a period of a month, I finally had the word from the owner and the owner's son (Mr Francesco) to keep my reservation open for future stay. But no refund could be made ! I was very disappointed of the poor service and the lack of response. We returned to Italy in June 2011, stayed at Hotel Manfredi but had to pay extra due to higher rate in June.

The size of the room is what a normal American hotel room would be with a King-Sized bed & a little niche for a seating area. Instead the niche has 2 cot-like (comfortable) beds so the room gets cramped. The bathroom has a small 4 steps up to it which can pose some logistic difficulties, but is fine.

It is a very nice little hotel on the 4th floor of the building. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room clean. Breakfast was great and the cappuccino a treat that got us hooked. The neighborhood is great, close to the Spanish Steps and other great sights.

The bathroom was only okay. After reading the reviews of this hotel and many other Roman hotels in the area we were expecting very small accommodations. Our room was a pleasant surprise. The breakfast room was great and fueled us for our day's activites. We cannot say enough about the hotel staff. From dinner suggestions to shopping to walking directions, each staff member spoke good English and went above and beyond to help us on a daily basis with any question or request. Magdalena, Sandrine and Roberta were always cheerful, upbeat and greeted us with big welcoming smiles every time we returned to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing. We could walk to every sight in Rome! The hotel is only a 10-15 minutes walk to any sight in Rome with the Colosseum being about a 25 minute walk away.

On check-in, they noticed from my passport that it was my birthday and delivered to our room a half bottle of wine, some chocolates and a card... a nice touch I felt. An issue regarding room availability on check-in was, after some discussion, settled to my complete satisfaction.

On the positive side, both rooms were quads which are VERY difficult to find in Europe, let alone Rome. The staff was extremely helpful, as was the doorman for the entire building on the ground floor. Similarly, the location is excellent and Via Margutta is a great spot. (Rent Roman Holiday for a cameo mention of Via Margutta.) The breakfast room is extremely small, but the choice was adequate. In addition, there was a superb selection of German/Austrian teas. I also suggest \"Il Brillo Parlante\" for a great lunch or dinner nearby. It is slightly Northwest of the hotel on a street that runs perpendicular to Via Margutta.
