{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Love Bali, but Avoid Villa Isabella Villa Isabella near Ubud, Bali, link [--], lived up to its 13 status. Run by a French woman (Isabella) and her partner (Englishman) is a potential tourist trap. The living quarters are beautiful, the house is in a spectacular location but .... opposite the villa are the loudspeakers of the local village temple. Our 3 weeks booking coincided with a 10 day celebrations clearly marked in the local calendar. Prayers werebroadcast day and night for 10 days straight. We love to be exposed to local culture, but I doubt any but deaf westerner would enjoy his stay in Villa Isabella. The owners know exactly what the problem is but would not tell you in advance even if you asked (we did ask if the place was quiet before we made a reservation). This would explain why we had to pay 50% deposit to book, and the owner would greet us on arrival at 2 a.m. in the morning to collect further 50% (cash only of course). The website suggests the cooking is included in the rate, however the owner reneged on this. She also tried to suggest that the kitchen is off-limit to visitors due to safety reasons(???). I suppose, if one considers the unhygienic state of the kitchen, it was a safety hazard (drains not working, no hot water)We apparently we had a hot water system in the house, but never managed to get it working despite owner's claims that it does work. Bali is a hot place, so we didn't fuss about it too much, however, if the owner wants to claim a luxurious accomodation status, one would expect hot water in the shower. The meals were good (prepared by local staff) but small, unreasonably priced (3 times the local restaurant prices), and meal presentation was not very appetizing (random collection of damaged plates, glasses and cutlery). The owner exploited her staff members and treated them like dirt (which was heart breaking to watch when one knows how lovely Bali people are).  After 2 sleepless nights (blasted by prayers from the laudspeaker) and heated exchange of words, the owner asked us to pack our bags and leave promising to refund the balance of our money. Despite repeated attempts we never received a penny back (over US$3000). We tried to contact police, consulted our embassy, but were reassured that it leads nowhere. All this happened 3 years ago, but we are still angry about it. The same people who own Villa Isabella run two other places in Bali: Gajah Mina Beach Resort ( [--] ), and Kubu Villas ([--]) but they refused to transfer us to an alternative accommodation. If anyone still wants to take a chance at Villa Isabella 13 or their other accomodation, my advice would be to avoid paying any more than one night in advance. If you are not happy, you can at least leave without any financial loss. Why waste good holidays? Owners said they tried everything to stop the noise at least at night time but were not able to get any support. They also said they were not awere that the place can be noisy. They are obviously getting mixed up with their own lies. After leaving Villa Isabella we ended up in Alam Shanti, Ubud, and returned there a couple of times since (highly recommended).I have recently noticed that Villa Isabella now rents for .... US$300.
