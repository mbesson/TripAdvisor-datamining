I booked a room at this hotel through an internet provider who had a noncancellation policy. To make a long story short, the room the service booked for me was too small for my party and Andrew, the manager of this hotel, went out of his way to help me cancel this room and get a full refund and even offered me their best room for an incredible price as he felt sorry for us since it was my daughter's 16th birthday gift. Needless to say, after such wonderful service, I have rebooked a room for April 28th and look forward to my stay here. If the hotel is as great as the service - this should be an amazing time!!

The staff were really friendly and knowledgeable, the rooms were always clean and neat, the noise level was sort of minimal (despite a few church bells) and the water was always hot. If I had to be critical, being that our window faced the alley on the side, we heard the beeping of trucks and other vehicles in the morning hours. Also there is a church close by so the bells will repeat over and over again. With the window closed though the noise is very minimal. The key cards sometimes didn't work so that was a bit inconvenient, but they had fresh water with fruit slices in the lobby! So that was a really nice touch. The KO Prime restaurant attached is nice, but we didn't eat there so I can't comment on that. It's overall a really nice place, I was very comfortable here. Oh that reminds me, the beds are amazing!!

Room was spacious and perfectly outfitted with the usual Kimpton amenities that make you smile. Bath was very clean and spacious. Housekeeping delivered extra pillows within minutes. Elevator rugs said \"inspire\" and \"dream\"! Breakfast was probably the best continental we've ever had - fresh fruit, warm croissants and muffins, great coffee and juice with thoughtful service. Some minor quibbles: Please put a sign out front that a driver can see as Boston traffic can be busy on Tremont! Seldom travel with a car and was new to valet parking - forgot my gloves in the car and went without for two days as car was inaccessible in some elevated garage. The \"12\" rooms are cave-like with a view of the legs of a man lying on his bed in the Omni next door. Always expect that we will not get the best room when we get a great deal but avoid the \"12's\" if possible!

We reserved two rooms, when we arrived at around 2:30 PM, only one was ready which was no problem since check in was at 3 PM. When we came back at around 4 PM the room was still not ready, we all crushed in the room that was supposed to be ready, taking turns to go to the bathroom, only to have housekeeping coming in to check the mini bar and the bathroom. Very annoying. When the second room was finally ready, I did notice dust flying in the air as we sat on the beds, maybe the faux fur bed covers are not very practical to clean. Also the toilette did not flush properly. As I mentioned, the staff was friendly and they tried to make up for the inconvenience of having to wait for our room.

The bed was also very comfortable. Now the downside... There aren't a lot of rooms on each floor which makes requesting a room away from the elevator almost impossible.

We were warmly greeted by Gabriella and escorted directly to our spacious double room. I grabbed a complimentary glass of Pinot Grigio on the way up, as it was happy hour. The decor is interesting but the alley view wasn't much to look at from the 6th floor window. Starting with the beds: wonderful linens, plenty of pillows, slept like a rock on a bed more comfortable than my own at home. The bathroom was modern, but the tub had an awkward system for running the shower which required getting wet to turn it on. Also, the water got all over the floor in spite of our best efforts to regulate the shower curtain. There was no exhaust in the bathroom which made for a really steamy room. That surprised us. The towels are also quite puny for a hotel like this. On our last morning we had very little hot water. Huge plus: the best stocked mini bar I have ever seen. And it wasn't that expensive either. Our TV remote did not work and it was replaced within five minutes of my call to the front desk. Nice bar on the second floor. We ordered room service one morning which came promptly. The room service menu clearly states that an 18% gratuity is added and a charge for delivery is also added to your order. However, the check handed to me by the server indicated only the price for the bagels and lox (which was $42 for three servings). I should have asked about the tipping, but instead I added a 20% tip. I was surprised to see that the final cost for three bagels with lox came to about $80. So the moral of the story is: don't add tips to room service. Most expensive bagels ever! They were good though. It's my fault for not asking for clarification. The location is wonderful. We walked all over Boston and enjoyed easy access to the Boston Common and Newbury Street. The front desk was extremely helpful in providing directions and they gave us a suggestion for Sunday breakfast (which had to include waffles!) so we walked to Beacon Hill and ate at The Paramount. Great suggestion.

I mention this only because they seemed so sincere and to me, that means I can expect greatness from them. Second, which was more of an issue for us, was that we had a guest next to us partying. We called the desk a couple of times and they did send someone up, but the rude guest took a long time to settle down. After the party ended, we heard a lot of noise for some time. The next day, the front desk told us that the noisy guest was paying for our parking. What we loved about the place was the decor and the service overall.

They are friendly, helpful and very businesslike. No requests were too much trouble. They excelled in hospitality. We would definitely return. P.S. The staff is very well versed in the dining scene. The Italian restaurant they recommended in the North End was the best Italian meal we've ever eaten. Everone agreed. There was not one complaint over the entire stay.

A great place to stay due to the proximity of many attactractions. You could walk to most everything. Accolades to Nine Zero and the Kimpton Organization. P.S.

From the moment we drove up, every single staff member was beyond helpful, friendly and delightful. That said, we were a little surprised by the $42/day parking charge. I joined the Kimpton In Touch rewards program so I had been made aware of a great deal going on with rooms starting at $129. Well of course it wasn't that cheap, we got a Queen Queen Room with a beautiful city view for $259. We took it anyway because we had read great things about it. We were going to look at Boston colleges for our daughter and decided it was worth it. We walked in the door and everyone from the valet person to the bell man to Gabriella, the front desk manager, was incredibly friendly and helpful. Gabriella was kind enough to give us coupons for $20 off dinner at their restaurant KO Prime (not that teen friendly, a little steep for burgers and fries), 4 coupons for free continental breakfast, 2 free drink coupons since we missed the wine reception, and $10 to use for the mini bar. We felt like celebrities. The room was quiet, and very \"swanky\" but one of the two queen beds was very well worn; the mattress was quite indented. Also the toilet had a little thing it did after each flush; made some interesting noises that might have alarmed someone that didn't know to jiggle the handle and wait a moment. The decor is so trendy and modern, you just can't help but feel really cool in there. We had a great trip and sadly had to cut it short, but I would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back myself. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the mattress and the bathroom. Let's face it, we got a deal but if I was paying upward of $450/night, I would not want to be rolling into the middle of a mattress because it was too soft on one side. Can't comment on kid's activities because our kids are too old for the stuff they offer but it seems they do try to cater to young kids, we saw a stroller or two and in fact we also saw several people traveling with their pets.

It was such a nice touch. The room was great for two. It was not huge, and had a queen-sized bed, but that is what we're used to, so it wasn't a problem. I did see some signs of wear in the room - chipped corners of desk drawers, paint touch-ups that didn't quite match the original paint job - but the room was very clean and bright. My complaints about the facilities are really quite minimal. I do wish the bathroom lights were on a dimmer, since the overhead light in the otherwise excellent shower (stall, but plenty big!) shined brightly in my eyes whenever I tipped my head back to rinse.

We arrived later in the evening than planned since we crawled through heavy traffic from NY due to the unseasonably intense snowstorm. We were quite tired. The woman at the front desk was courteous and very nice. She had us quickly checked in and offered us a glass of wine (this was way past the wine reception hour) to help unwind after the ordeal! Like others mentioned, it's very easy to miss the hotel. I saw the sign for the Omni Parker Hotel first which clued me in that 9-0 was coming up. I never spotted the 9-0 sign, but I did see the KO cow sign for their steakhouse so I knew the hotel was right there on that corner. Having read another review, I told my friend to make a left into the side street for valet parking. There's no way of knowing otherwise! No signs at all until you've passed it...and only if you're looking hard (it's on the column post). It's a pretty busy area (depending on the time you arrive) so it's no fun to have to go around and come back for a 2nd attempt. Tremont is a one way street. The hotel being a Kimpton is pet friendly, and I saw plenty of dogs. Last year, I stayed at Kimpton's Marlowe in Cambridge across the Charles River and saw only 1 or 2 dogs. I also liked that the decor at 9-0 is more restrained. None of the loud leopard prints (not my style) found at Marlowe. The hotel wasn't too busy but not sure whether it's because it's a bit off season now or whether the weather kept people away. It was nicely quiet, and I only heard the neighbor's door close at night and in the morning. The cleaning crew was not particularly loud. This hotel seems to be following the trend of scenting the public areas (particularly the elevator). I'm not too keen on this, and I found the elevator to be a wee bit strongly scented as if someone wearing strong perfume had just exited. I prefer subtle to no scents but have experienced worse so I considered it acceptable. We really liked our room which had two queen beds with a view of the city. It was adequately spacious given the prime downtown location. I only felt cramped in that I had no good spot to put my luggage. My friend by the window was fine but I was right up against the door. I ended putting the luggage rack up against the bed (so as not to block the door). Problem is the bed would prevent my luggage from fully opening as it would push against the top. So when I needed to access it, I would pull the rack out and push it back in when done. At least I had a workaround. The view was fabulous overlooking the commons and the city beyond. We were on the 18th floor which is nearly at the top. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the windows actually open! It was nice to get a bit of fresh breezy air in. Not that it was stuffy. The desk was outfitted with the essentials but not much else. Fine for me. I did like the desk chair which appeared to be adjustable (unless it was broken ;) haha!). It was comfortable but supportive. I didn't care for the faux feathery blanket on the bed. It looks nice as a decorative item, but from a hygienic standpoint...I quickly took it off the bed. ;) I doubt it gets a regular cleaning because the tag said dry clean. =O The bed was comfy and we had 4 pillows each. They're not all the same so keep switching them out until you find one you like. That was a pleasant discovery as I once stayed at a hotel where they had nothing but fat pillows (I asked) that made my neck hurt. I didn't sleep a wink there. =( Be forewarned that there is a feather mattress pad. Mine had feathers escaping. Not realizing this, I was disturbed to be poked in the dark by the linens. I feared I was sleeping on unclean linens littered with crusty stains (yes, it's happened to me elsewhere). It was only the hard end of the feathers. Phew! After pushing them back in, it was smooth (literally) sleeping. Like other Kimptons, there is no coffee/hot water maker. You must call it up. I didn't need it this time so it was ok, but I understand how people would be upset not knowing this detail. I don't know why they do this except for cost savings? I hope it also means the devices are cleaner being under their watch which I would consider to be the greatest perk (hint! hint! if you're reading Kimpton!). FYI, the prices for the mini bar items are on the reverse side of the big square paper with the hotel name. I thought it was a giant coaster so I didn't think to look at it. The bathroom was spacious with a pivoting (looked like it) mirror. The shower was nice and hot with decent pressure. The faucets though were odd. At the sink, you need to turn them opposite of what's normal (clockwise?) but at the tub, it was the normal direction (anti-clockwise?). One niggle with the shower faucet is that there is no indicator of how far you must turn to get the right temperature as it's not a lever with clear stops on either end. Once you figure it out, you can enjoy the fixture as it matches the sink and is not the ho-hum typical ones. =) For me, 2 to 2.5 full turns was just right. Volume control is the little lever by the way. ;) I didn't care for the toiletries as the scent was a bit too strong for me. The bar soap is the type that leaves that oily feeling after rinsing which I don't like. In the tub, that translates to a bit of slipperiness on the feet. I quickly washed it off and then was fine. My only real complaint about 9-0 is the cleaning staff. The shampoo, conditioner and lotion are in tubes. I used the lotion shortly after arriving. There was a foil seal under the cap indicating unused. When I showered later, I opened the shampoo cap but found no foil seal. Hmm...is that because you're in the tub and it would be cumbersome to remove with wet hands? Plus where would you put the foil aside from flinging it somewhere in the bathroom? Turns out the conditioner had a foil seal so clearly the cleaning staff did not do their job on replacing the used shampoo. =( Either way, I think it's a silly idea to have people remove tiny foil seals in the shower. I'm sure some have washed down the drain. I kept mine half attached. ;) As for the location, it's truly a prime spot. You have many T stations at your disposal. Park St (by the Commons) for the Red, Green and Orange (if you know how to find it) lines, Downtown Crossing (with its many shops in the area) for the Orange line and Government Center for the Blue line (not too far). Of course all the landmark spots are nearby. The entire area is a great for walking with the lovely buildings, history, upscale and not upscale shopping, delicious eats, theatres and of course for strolls through the park. We didn't get to eat at KO. We'd planned for Sunday brunch but turns out they're closed then! The woman at the front desk suggested Scollay Square to us which I'd read prior to arriving that it was pretty good. A short walk. Much to my delight, I found that Mooo, the steakhouse is right next door. Perhaps Mooo was not mentioned because it is part of the XV Beacon Hotel. Haha! It was as delicious as I'd expected. We had no reservations obviously, but it wasn't a problem. I'm not so sure they could have taken us if it were a Saturday night. Though just a weekend jaunt, we had a very pleasant stay and would stay here again. The staff are very courteous and accommodating to your needs.

Boston is a great city and the vibe was good as soon as we arrived. The hotel was a $20-25 ride from Logan airport. It is very centrally located to just about all the city has to offer. We were given a bottle of wine on arrival, for our anniversary, from Patricia at the front desk whom we found more than helpful. The room was not as large as previous hotels on our trip, we had trouble locating a position for our two suitcases that was not in the way. The room itself was very nice although there were no facilities for making coffee in the room. I joined the Kimpton club to take advantage of the free wi-fi for members. This was very good. My main problem with the hotel was on the last night there was a function held in the lobby. Guests were ushered through a back door by staff, who seemed to be there to make sure that you kept moving and would not interfer with the function. The noise generated by the function was quite loud. We were on the 10th floor and could feel the thump from the base music. It would have been unbearable on the lower floors. The music continued until around midnight. I feel the hotel management was treating the guests with contempt for hosting this event. They are either a hotel or event management establishment.

When I declined, he got all huffy and told me it was to prevent credit card fraud. I explained that demanding to see photo ID violated the credit card merchant agreement. He didn't seem to care. What was particularly odd was that I had pre-paid for the two night stay, so I was handing over my credit card only to guarantee payment on incidentals (like the mini-bar that no one touches, I suppose). I complained to management, which replied that the policy was to prevent credit card fraud, but they completely ignored the fact that they were violating the terms under which they are allowed to use credit cards. If they are ignoring these (really rather important) rules, you have to wonder what other rules they are ignoring. If they think it's OK to put their guests in danger of identity theft (which is why they aren't allowed to ask for ID), maybe they are cutting corners with fire safety, too? Maybe they don't thing that building codes are something they need to comply with? Two other complaints: the motto for this property is \"Inspired by Design\". The rooms are certainly distinctive, and while the decor is easy on the eyes, it is anything but practical. For example, my room had a wing-back chair that had all sorts of wacky odd proportions that made it look like something out of Alice in Wonderland. The problem with this is that it also made the chair really uncomfortable to sit in. There was also a bed spread that looked like it was covered in feathers, but you had to wonder how they keep this thing clean - dry clean after every guest comes through? The bathroom had very clean, simple lines, but that meant there was nowhere to hang your towels after you used them. Your average Marriott may never be featured in Architectural Digest, but you'll have a more comfortable stay.

Firstly the negative points. We had some problems when dealing with the reception staff. On checking into the hotel the receptionist thought we were only staying for 4 nights instead of 5. She didn't seem to understand the pre-paid voucher which we had been provided with by our travel agent. The voucher clearly stated we had 5 nights booked - we also had our e-ticket with us as proof of this. The receptionist advised us that she would need to check the booking with the travel agent and that she would let us know if we \u00e2\u20ac\u0153owed them any money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I must assume that she was dubious of our booking as, at this point, she only provided us with breakfast vouchers for 4 nights. The next day we spoke to the receptionist again to check if everything was sorted and she said that it was, however I still had to ask for the additional breakfast vouchers. The day before departure we requested a late check-out and were advised that this wasn't a problem. We were told that there was usually a charge but that on this occasion the charge would be waived. On our day of departure we arrived back at the hotel after doing some last minute shopping only to find our room key cards were no longer working. Given our previous experience we did not find this surprising. We had to return to reception and explain our situation in order to have the key cards reactivated. When we came to check-out we once again dealt with the same receptionist. She had apparently forgotten about our problem on check-in and said that we had pre-paid for one night and that we still owed the balance for the other four. I had to remind her that our accommodation was all pre-paid (via the voucher). After much keyboard tapping and staring at a screen she then announced that everything was fine and we were free to go. I understand that the staff deal with a lot of different people but we spoke to the same receptionist 4 times during our stay and she did not remember us. I feel this is a very important customer care issue. When I got home I didn't have much confidence that I wouldn't be charged twice for staying at the hotel so I contacted my travel agent immediately. Luckily I was only charged for the expected items. Now the positives. The hotel is in an ideal position just off Boston Common. Our room was on the 16th floor with a spectacular view of the river and city. On arrival, there was a complimentary bottle of wine with cheese, biscuits and fruit and a lovely note from house keeping. The room was huge with an absolutely wonderful, extremely comfortable bed. Breakfast is served until 11am during the week and 12pm at the weekend which is fantastic if you want to have a relaxing holiday. We had the continental breakfast which consisted of fresh fruit juice, water, coffee/tea, croissant, muffin and mixed fruit which was a perfect way to start the day.

Our room was spacious and comfortable; we were upgraded to a King room with a view that overlooked Boston Common, the Public Garden, and we could see Fenway in the distance. A spectacular view for a great location; I'm glad we didn't' get stuck with a view of the alley or back of the hotel like some others apparently have; guess we were lucky. The only slightly negative thing that I noticed about the room was that it was apparent that the furniture was old and had been through some tough times; scratch marks and signs of wear and tear on the desks, the chairs, the night stands, and some of the doors were all visible. And yes, like others have said, the TV in the room was one of those old HUGE flat front and gigantic back TVs... could probably use an upgrade. But oh well, we didn't spend our trip in our room so things were satisfactory. Yes, it's a pet hotel, but I can't recall seeing more than a few pets around and we were never bothered by noise of any kind, from guests or pets or anything, so no issues there We took advantage of the fitness room, which had treadmills, elliptical machines, some free weights and a weight machine, and other exercise items. It wasn't huge, but it was adequate and there were never more than 2 or 3 people in it at a time, so no worries there. We ate at KO Prime for dinner our first night and for breakfast the next morning. The food selection was great and service was good as well. We absolutely loved the dinner and left stuffed and fulfilled. Breakfast took a little long to get to us but was fine once we finally were able to start eating. The quirky and chic nature of the entire establishment was a breath of fresh air. Always got a good vibe of the atmosphere, the staff were all nice and helpful whenever we needed info or help with transportation, and everything appeared clean and well taken care of. We only took advantage of the reception with wine on our first day of arrival (mainly since we were out so much) but it was a welcome perk on arrival after our plane ride. Some Kimpton hotels offer shuttle service back and forth to the airport, but this one is a little out of a shuttle range, so if you have no car, you'll have to take a taxi back and forth for your flight. One thing that I'm proud of is my decision to not have a rental car for this trip. Nine Zero is located right next to Park Street Station for the T (their subway station) and it took us everywhere we needed to go. Just another benefit of Nine Zero's location and vicinity to other things. There are some shopping areas, stores, restaurants, and sites to see in the area as well so it pays to walk out of the hotel and explore the area since there's so much available. All in all, I was very satisfied with my stay, the value was what I expected, and Nine Zero lived up to Kimpton's reputation of great service, great hotels and great perks. FREE WI-FI!!! Gotta love the inTouch program... :) if we're in Boston again (which might happen because we LOVED our trip), we'll definitely make use of Nine Zero again if we're in the downtown area.

Our only quibble: why did the hotel select remote controls that make it so hard to watch TV? Unlike the remotes we've encountered in other hotels, the remotes at Nine Zero don't indicate how to navigate from pay-per-view movies to regular TV channels. Nor are there any on-screen prompts to help. It's really frustrating when you just want to watch the news to deal with a system that's clearly designed to prevent you from doing this [perhaps the designers thought that if they made it really hard to access regular TV channels, guests would just give up and pay to watch a movie?].

This was our first stay at a Kimpton Hotel. We signed up for their in-touch program when making the reservation. This gave us the option of upgrading our room from a Queen Deluxe to either a Queen Premier View or a King Premier View for $15 a night if any were available at check in. In addition we were given a $10 credit for mini-bar. It is worth it to sign up if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We were upgraded and stayed in room 1502, which is a Queen Premier View Room. The room was located in a corner. We had two windows, one looking down Tremont St toward the Government Center and the other gave us a view of the State House and out across the Boston Common. I did not see the deluxe room so I cannot compare the two. The room was spacious, especially for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boutique\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel, which was worth the extra money. However the view from our end of the building was nothing special, it was obstructed, where the other end of the building was not. This had to be the quietest hotel that I have ever stayed in, which was appreciated. I was skeptical of this because of Kimpton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pet policy, but no complaints. I heard one dog bark in 3 days. We were able to sleep in without being woken by loud doors and hallway noise, certainly a first. The beds, pillows, sheets were so comfortable. They are on par with anywhere else we have stayed. The bathroom was spacious and it had a nice marble shower. They pay close attention to detail in the hotel which makes it feel special. The lobby is very welcoming. The location is great. It is located Steps from Beacon Hill and the Boston Common, a short 5 minute walk to Quincy Market / Faneuil Hall, close to the Waterfront boats, ferries and aquarium and the Theater District. There is a T line right down the street to take you to Copley Sq / Back Bay or down to visit the animals at Fenway Park and to the North End going the other direction if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk. The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. The concierge was very helpful. They helped us try to get an extra set of tickets to the Red-Sox Yankee game, and gave us advice on tours. The ferry ride to Salem was nice and relaxing. We used the fitness center once. It has two treadmills, two ellipticals, two universal weight machines and some free weights. We did not eat at the restaurant, however the KO Prime looked great. It cost us $40 a night to park, but that is pretty much the norm in Boston. This was the fourth hotel which I have stayed at in Boston (Marriott Long Wharf, Marriott Cambridge, Millennium Bostonian, I usually go with who offers the best rate at the time, this time it was the Nine Zero) and it was as good as the others mentioned. The only cons were, there was no dresser space to put you clothes. Just one small drawer. I like to unpack and not live out the suitcase, not an option. Also there is not mini-fridge, which I could have used, just the stocked honor bar. Really minor details. I would recommend the Nine Zero to anyone. I will try to post some photos when I have time.

ROOMS: We had a room with 2 beds, room size was good practical and functional with a desk and chair, TV, CD player with kimton relaxing music... bathroom was perfect size and had everything we needed. Beds are soooooooooooooo comfortable, my friend wanted to take it home :) SERVICE: As usual the staff was warm, friendly and welcoming. Always saying have a good day or have a good night or is everything ok... World class service!! We dealt with Preethi at the reception desk when we had problems with a room key and she gaves us quick service and some advice to make sure they dont deactivate. She also checked us out and was very professional and warm and held avery nice converation during the process. Service like this should be everywhere... VALET: this is our first time using valet service from a hotel, it was quick and efficient and the staff were very polite and helped us to load our bags on departure. last but not least... the Kimpton tradition... WINE HOUR: this is like the best part of everything I like about the Kimpton... one hour of wine service red/white... best part you can have more than one glass!! :) I find this service gives you the feel that you are truly staying in a luxury hotel... OTHER: Hotel is well located near train stations, boston common and few other places within walking distance (ie Aquarium abt 15-20 min walk). Another great touch is that they have water dispensers in the lobby. It is flavored with real fruits and is delicious coming back from a warm day on the town...

There is one thing that this Kimpton does that I've never encountered elsewhere that I think they should change. The Kimpton offers free morning coffee which is great. Every other Kimpton I've stayed in has large carafes in the lobby and guests can serve themselves. The Nine Zero requires guests to go to their restaurant and ask the beleaguered hostess to get you a cup. You don't get to cream and sugar it yourself--they do it for you. Twice, I had to wait five minutes just to get the hostess's attention. It makes no sense that I have to ask someone for a free cup of coffee. The Nine Zero needs to move the coffee to a place guests can serve themselves. But, the coffee is a small thing. It's a lovely hotel, the staff is great and the location ideal.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCan't argue with these glowing reviews\u201d", "Author": "HughJarres", "ReviewID": "UR107193593", "Content": "The locaion is superb - just opposite the Old Granary Burying Ground, along from Park Street Church and a stone's throw from Boston Common.

At this academy you learn to be THE most helpful, kind, knowledgable, polite and lovely staff members. If this is the case, then everyone at this hotel must have graduated with honours!!! We stayed 5 nights in April. The hotel deserves its 4 star rating. We asked for a pet free floor and I'm glad we did. Although the hotel was spotlessly maintained and extremely clean it does except pets. It is not the hotel but some of the owners that there could be issues with. I had an elevator ride with an extremely wet very smelly English sheep dog. Now I am a dog lover myself and have a dog indoors in my home, its just if you have any allergies, asthmas etc then you may wish to book a pet free floor. Otherwise when travelling far from home after leaving your pet, it is nice to see dogs around the hotel. There was a small issue for our first night and when we finally arrived very late at night we had been given an lovely cheese platter and a bottle of wine and complementary continental breakfast cards. This was not at all expected but just goes to show how they can not do enough for their guests The rooms are very clean and stylishly decorated with lovely products. Our whole stay at this hotel was absolutely wonderful. Thomas and Peter?James (sorry) the concierge gave us so many ideas and their recommendation for things to do and for meals were spot on. I must say one of the best meals we have ever eaten was at Grlll 23. The best rib eye our whole family had ever had and the deserts were delicious. Also Atlanitc Fish Company is also a great night out. Neither are a cheap restaurant but worth the splurge. The Kimpton hotels offers free wifi when you are a member and a few other little benfits. It costs nothing to join and we found this a bonus. A stay in this hotel will not disappoint.

Without knowing anything about areas in Boston, I read many, many reviews and settled on the Nine Zero Hotel. I was actually disappointed in the hotel and do not understand why it is so highly rated. When I arrived, check in was awkward due to a special event in the lobby. I was not directed to use a different entrance, so I entered in the main lobby. After many unfriendly stares from the people who I guess were having the event and tripping over a special effects lighting apparatus, I made my way to the 3rd floor lobby.

The room itself was small but well-planned, with very comfortable beds and pillows and a spacious bathroom. In fact, the hairdryer that came in the bathroom was even nicer than the one I have at home. The service was unbelievable. Kevin, at the front desk, gave us wonderful restaurant recommendations again and again, and Thomas had another bottle of champagne sent up for us on our last night, as well.

Location was excellent, close to two different T stops and right next to Quincy Market, so even the nearly two feet of snow that fell on our second day in Boston barely affected our plans. The hotel also gave us a free on-demand movie rental during the blizzard, and even sent up popcorn when we decided to watch it! My only possible complaints would be the heat was very loud whenever it kicked on, especially in the middle of the night, and there's no fan in the bathroom.

I have been to kimpton hotels before so i knew that the rooms, the decor, the service and the perks would be impeccable and the nine zero did not disappoint. I called the night before we flew and told them i booked a standard room but was wondering if they had a larger room available. They did, they held a room for us and it just made it that much more comfortable. Every morning and most nights they would bring warm milk for my little one to help her start the day or settle down at night. They did this at no extra cost, i know it's just a small cup of milk but as tired weary parents the last thing we wanted to do was walk to dunkin donuts or starbucks in the cold for milk (both of which are close by) They also had toys to give to my daughter (which she thought was amazing.) There are two metro or T stops close by : government center and park street. If you fly into logan you get a shuttle to the blue line and get off at government center. Faneuil Hall/Quincy market is a very short walk and is a good option for different types of foods.They also have live shows outside which was a nice treat. There is shopping close by, the childrens museum and breweries (for when baby naps in the stroller) were very easy to get to. If you have any questions the concierge are very very helpful. In the winter time there isnt much going on for very little ones. Target have a deal with the childrens museum for friday nights - they have made the entrance fee $1 per person so we took advantage of that. The tree lighting ceremony was cool to watch too. For the rest of the time I was at a loss for ideas and the concierge pointed us into the right direction.

We travelled from Ireland for a girlie shopping weekend. We had our hotel reservation cancelled from 1800 hotels when they went bust so I called the hotel direct. An email to the reservations manager Josh put any worries to rest when he matched the 1800 price. On arrival after a long flight we were greeted by the smiling face of Erin who got us a glass of wine whilst we checked in. Our room was beautiful, on 6th floor as I cannot travel in elevators........room was a tiny bit small for all our shopping after the outlets but can request a bigger one for our next visit!!! On our return that evening a cheese board and wine awaited us in our room.........Breakfast was good and set us up for the day. After the outlets the bell hops brought our bags to the room while we part took in the wine tasting.............we are Irish after all! Anyway, I jokingly commented to John B the concierge that we were thrilled with the cheeseboard but would've loved the choc strawberries as they are my fave. When we got back to the room that night there to my complete surprise was a plate of choc strawberries!! There are so many more things I can tell but don't wanna bore you or indeed make you jealous. Suffice to say I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this is more than a match for any of them. The only thing they haven't got the star for is that they don't have a pool/spa...........but it certainly makes up for it in many many ways. I have never felt so welcome and so important EVER in any hotel. Our girlie trip was one of the best trips of my life and I'm already planning our return. Thanks so much to all the staff at the Nine Zero esp Josh, John B, Kevin, Erin and Ben.

After trying many hotels in Boston from the Four Seasons to the new Mandarin Oriental, the Hotel Marlowe remained our firm favorite. Who knew another Kimpton hotel would be the only contender to give it a serious run for the money?

For us, the most important aspect of a hotel is location, location, location and this hotel had it. You felt like you could walk almost anywhere in 15 minutes. It's located in the Theatre District and the hotel is right along the Freedom Trail, so you are literally in the midst of all of the activity. Plenty to see, do and eat! The rooms were spacious, comfortable and very, very clean. The staff at the hotel was more than accommodating and made you feel at home from the minute you walked into the hotel. Their complimentary wine and refreshments at the end of the day were a very nice touch. The Park Street T Station is located right next to the hotel and is a very convenient way to get around the places in the City you can't necessarily walk (we took it to the Museum of Fine Art and Fenway to catch a Red Sox game). There is an excellent place next door called the Beantown Pub, which has a really nice atmosphere and good food (I recommend the Paul Revere sandwich)! KO Prime, which is located in the hotel, has a very nice and tasty breakfast menu at a reasonable price for hotel fare. Overall, we would recommend this hotel to anyone.

The air conditioning struggled to keep up in the heat of the day; the lighting in the room was very poor, and two efforts to get additional lighting failed; one of the two elevators was out of service almost the entire time of our stay, so there were long waits for the one working elevator; one of the key card readers failed repeatedly, leading to some unhappiness; and on some occasions, hot water came out of the cold water tap.

While some aspects of my stay were wonderful, like the style of the room, the luxriousness of the decor, the service at the front desk upon checkin, there were other aspects that made me shake my head in disbelief. I was greeted warmly, checked in promptly and went to my room. I immediately felt like I was in a high-end hotel. Although the elevators seemed slow, I'm thinking \"This is nice\". Word of warning, if you don't like ambient music played rather loudly throughout the hotel's common areas, this may not be the place for you. Upon entering my room, I was immediately impressed with the decor and cleanliness. The view is lacking but like any hotel in a space deprived city, sometimes you just have to look at another wall. What surprised me the most was the apparent attention to detail in all things visually, but the TV in the room was not an HD or even LCD. It was a 5+ year old Sony Trinitron. It just seemed out of place. I went to dinner in the hotel restauarant. The food was EXCELLENT but you need a light source to see the menu. It's THAT DARK. The restaurant is called KO and it's a steakhouse. I only wish they had a steak smaller than 7 oz on the menu and a Filet option less than 8oz. Still I opted for the Filet and ended up eating all of it. It really was good. While there is no coffee in the room (or a place to get it in the hotel) there is an abundence of alcohol. I suppose partiers would enjoy this. On my second night, I ordered out. When the delivery person arrived I received a call and he was escorted to my room for safety. I thought that was excellent. However, when I called down to ask for utensils (delivery man forgot) I waited 30 minutes and eventually made due and ate my food without. Thankfully, I could. The water in the shower / sink was EXTREMELY hot. I could hardly take a shower today because I could only turn the knob barely on to get the water as cool as it could be while still maintaining enough pressure to come out of the shower head.

We were in Boston for my husband to run the Boston Marathon, and I booked a room at the Nine Zero because of our previous positive experiences with Kimpton Hotels. The Nine Zero did not disappoint. We arrived just after noon, and both people at the front desk were helping other guests. The concierge, Thomas, immediately came out from behind his desk and offered to check us in. I thought that our room might not be ready because we were well in advance of the posted check-in time, but not only was our room ready but we'd received a complimentary upgrade to a suite! We also were given a $10 minibar credit for being Kimpton In Touch members. Our room was fabulous - very large with a living and dining room area, a good-sized bathroom and a separate bedroom. Our window looked right out on the historical Granary Burying Ground across from the hotel and also afforded views of the Common just down the street. Our bed was quite comfortable and our room exceedingly quiet. We never heard other guests or street noise. We found the hotel's location ideal for walking around on the Freedom Trail and for taking the T to sites further afield. The Nine Zero is a stone's throw from the Park Street T station and just a block or two from the Government Center station. Thomas and the rest of the front desk staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming as we came and went from the hotel. We also enjoyed the afternoon wine reception in the lobby. An unexpectedly nice touch was a complimentary breakfast set out for the runners the morning of the marathon. They even had packets of runners gel for them to take along to the race! Some highlights of our time in Boston were an afternoon Red Sox game, pizza at Regina's in the North End, cannolis from Mike's Pastry, riding the green line out Comm Ave to Boston College and being shown around by my cousin who's a student there, strolling through the Boston Common, and having dinner with friends at Antico Forno in the North End. We were very impressed with the incredibly warm reception of Bostonians to the marathon runners. Everywhere we went the night of the race, people congratulated my husband. The manager at Regina's even brought him a free keyring from the restaurant. Overall a wonderful trip to Boston and a great stay at the Nine Zero.

The hotel has a good first-class urban location, convenient to the Financial District and the Commons. It is a 1990s-era boutique hotel, in a building with a clean architectural look, though nothing special. The common areas/amenities are limited, but fine. The hotel offers a good range of services (spa, small fitness room, room service, etc.). The rooms and bathrooms are good-sized, though the build quality is not great and you may well hear your neighbors (a baby, in my case). If it makes a difference to you, they feature Aveda products. As a \"hip, cool, urban\" place to stay, this is faded glory. The room fixtures are OK, but clearly dated (the whole look, the lack of flat-screen TVs', etc.) and a bit beaten up (chipped furniture). I found the place a little weird. First, the smell of incense in the room (no kidding) was about as subtle as the \"Conservatory\" at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. And the decor package in the rooms (and the lobby) has a \"kasbah\" quality. Naugahide/plastic...whatever it is, I found it neither comfortable nor tasteful. The very tall headboard, with its four \"pillows\" hanging from the top, is an attempt at design that didn't work.

Late Sunday morning, when I was drying my hair, somebody knocked - I assumed it was housekeeping, but my husband answered, and only told me later, who our guest was. It was in fact two new guests to our room! They only knocked because they could hear the noise from the dryer. They had keys and would otherwise have entered our room. We were on our way out, so my husband didn't mention anything. Late afternoon somebody called us asking for a strange name, and later they came knocking on our door, seeking their friends - reception had given them our room number. We were again on our way out, but when we returned late Sunday nigth reception called and apologised for the trouble - and this was it. We consider this to be a very serious lack in their security system, and felt very unsafe for the rest of our stay, but we were busy and didn't want to spend any time dealing with the hotel, but we did expect a more formal apology! Also we discovered that the cleaning had been very light! We had very bad weather during our stay, so it was only on the last day the sun was shining, and we could see all the dust everywhere - on all tables! Nasty. Finally we had some bad advise regarding dining from Thomas (we told him later, but he had never experienced this before, so what he was saying was that he didn't believe us!). We had before coming to the hotel asked for his help getting some basketball tickets, and this worked out fine. When picking them up Friday night, we asked for a nice restaurant for Saturday nigth. He recommended Atlantic Fish and made a reservation. Again it was OK, the food was OK, but it was very busy, and not at all what we expected. Ofcourse Thomas got a nice tip for the help with the tickets and the reservation, so we expected him to act in our interest. Sunday he was not at work, so we told his colleague that we were not happy with Atlantic Fish, and asked for something better for Sunday night. After mentioning 5-8 other restaurants he finally got to the Oceannaire, which was quite close, why we picked this. It was over the top. A real restaurant, whereas Atlantic Fish was more cafeteria-style. When mentioning this at Oceannaire, our waiter told us that the concierges at the hotels receive commission from some restaurants, and this is how they make their pick. If this is right it means that we tipped Thomas for some advise, he already received payment for from the restaurant - very bad attitude!

What changed this time was simple: whereas previously we had both been attending conferences, this time she attended a conference while I accompanied our young son around Boston. And it was specifically within the kid department that things were just... OK. I had specified in my reservation that not only was my five-year-old coming, but that it happened to fall on his birthday. From this site, I realized that he might get a special treat; from Kimpton's website, I saw that they have a special program for kids. And when we checked in.... nada. In fact, we were asked to wait while the room was finished being \"made up\"; for this, I assumed something was happening that was special for our child. When we were finally up to the room, we found... a very nice room, but nothing special was added. We went out for a bit, and upon our return there were some lovely cookies and chocolate covered strawberries (which were great, and appreciated) -- but if they knew we were checking in (we were not early at all), I wondered if things should have been settled ahead of time. Granted, I did not ask for anything specific for our child, but even when I asked specifically for a list of nearby kid-friendly activities (which their website advertises), this was not provided. The concierge (very nicely) told me verbally about some of the museums (Children's. Science, etc.), but the very things advertised that would make this a special experience for a kid were never offered. My disappointment in my stay, therefore, is simply that I had *expected* something more, since I had had a very personal experience previously. I specifically chose a Kimpton hotel to feel \"special\" -- and I felt this was lost. I think perhaps the simple problem may have been that we had a child, and that staff generally did not know what to do with him. (I did not see any other children around during our stay.) Only one bellhop specifically addressed our son at all -- and, given that this happened at the VERY end of the trip, my son completely loved it. I *do* think that this is a good hotel in general -- but I found it in the end a bit cold, and perhaps more specifically catered to business travelers than other vacationers. Had I been on a business trip, I think I would have been fine.

He was very polite and inviting and treated my girlfriend and me with respect and genuinely warm courtesy. He was also nice enough to provide us with a free breakfast the following morning. I don't believe this always is the case, but maybe us being polite to his crew and him made breakfast on Kimpton. The room was magnificent! From the 16th floor, we had a wide view of the entire skyline of Boston. It was beautiful. The room was in stellar condition complete with a way better than average sound system/CD player, a separate IPOD Dock Station, a plasma TV, and excellent mini bar (full capability to make any martini you want with Grey Goose, Belvedere in-stock as well as Maker's Mark, beer, wine, etc.). We also took full advantage of the comfortable evening wear that came with the room (aka robes). After checking in we strongly considered just ordering room service because the menu was tempting. We realized that going to KO Prime was a pipe dream based on V-Day and no reservation but having a five star restaurant within the hotel is also nice.

While the room was small, it was very well appointed and had an upscale yet cozy feeling to it. I felt as though I was living on the edge of the Boston Common... The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a great shower. There were robes for both of us and just about anything you could think of in the way of food and drink in the mini bar. The only thing missing was a second chair and I bet if I had asked, I would have had one delivered in no time. The hotel is in a perfect location for getting around Boston. It's steps to the subway, a short walk to the theater district, Beacon Hill and so much more. It truly is a gem in terms of location and ambiance. We had a delicious breakfast on Sunday morning. The coffee was hot and strong and each order cooked to perfection... and even a New York Sunday Times.. which we promptly took back to our room for Sunday reading. The staff at Nine Zero clearly love the hotel they are working for. Funny, attentive and willing to serve... What more could anyone ask for? Thanks Nine Zero!!!

There's something about their beds & feather top pillow that makes it by far the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in! We also love the decor of the room & hotel. It's very posh/trendy/comfy & the rooms are quite spacious. They also have a cozy 'living room' type lobby where they have a wine tasting nightly. Also have one restaurant/bar within hotel called 'KO Prime'. Looked quite trendy, but didn't eat there so can't comment on that. My Mom ordered room service for breakfast both mornings & loved it. We're not the type to raid the mini-bar as we like to dine/drink out, but we were impressed with everything they had in it! There was just about anything you could drink and/or snack on it! The service is incomparable as the staff goes out of the way to meet your every request. The concierge, \"Thomas Burke\", was wonderful & so pleasurable to work with!

Every person we interacted with at the front desk, room service & housekeeping was truly a pleasure to deal with. Also, since the hotel is 'pet friendly', they provide pet bowls, pet beds & dog walkers/sitters upon request (fee required for dog walking/sitting). We've never brought our dog to a hotel before & what a pleasurable experience they made it for her/us! The best part for dogs is, the Boston Common is 1 block from the hotel which has a dog park. Even if your dog isn't the type to play with other dogs, at least they've always got a close place \"to go\" since Boston Common is just across the street. They told us all the Kimpton owned hotels are 'pet friendly' which is great to know for future trips. We also stayed here once before during summer 2009 & absolutely loved it then as well!

Having read here on Trip Advisor about how amazing the service is, I decided to put in a small request. I called the morning of our reservation and asked if our room could have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nice view,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since it was my friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trip EVER to Boston, I considered it a pretty fair demand, yet I know it might have been a lil last minute. I was so pleased to speak with Thomas, the concierge, directly, b/c T.A. users had applauded his efforts in the past. As he was typing away at the computer I heard him murmur, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd From that alone I knew this is obviously a gentleman who relishes creating that exceptional experience! Before we got off the phone Thomas promised that our view AND OUR WHOLE STAY would be terrific. I simply hoped not to stare at the side of a building; Thomas however, exceeded our expectations! Our girlfriend getaway became truly luxurious after leaving our car at the valet (directions from the website are right-on) and signing in at the desk where John, the concierge on duty, told us we were on the 19th floor (top!) and had two queen size beds (we had originally only reserved one). Upon entering the room we were absolutely giddy! The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was perfect, which is why I love staying at boutique hotels, muted and posh, not one disgusting floral print in sight! My friend loved the edgy faux fur throws, as well as the IPOD dock which she hooked up to right away and started blasting dance music. We opened up a hand-written note from Thomas telling us to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Get ready for THE BEST stay! Seriously.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd accompanied by a bottle of Pino Grigio chilling on ice and a fruit plate. Glass of wine in hand, good beats, the perfect view of the city lights and Boston Commons; as we ladies started to pretty ourselves up for a night on the town, my friend squealed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love Boston!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even left the hotel yet!! When we were ready we moseyed on downstairs and spoke to Johnny about some places to go. He sent us around the corner to Zen for sushi which was great, as well as reasonably priced! For $25 we split several rolls and were more than full. After that we went to the Beantown Pub next to our hotel and across from Sam Adams grave. So of course I ordered a Sam Adams! There was a great crowd there early and we watched some people play pool. From there we decided to hit up Mantra to listen to some music. We wanted to dance too, but seeing as no one else there was, we ended up leaving\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 too many girls with their arms crossed, sitting down, staring off, it reminded me of a middle school dance (ntm my drink was watery and gross). Regardless b/c Johnny had sent us there with the right information of who to ask for we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait in line and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay cover (two things that can seriously inhibit the night if you want to wander around and try new places out). After Mantra, we took a quick cab ride to Ned Devines, only to be told they had reached capacity. I had been there previously and never had a problem but maybe it was more popular that night. While I wanted to try some places within that same neighborhood my friend had enough of places that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living up (how could you beat the hotel after all, even with a crowd and music?!) and said she just wanted to go back to Beantown, so we did. We hung the rest of the night there, and ended up running into some guys from NY staying at the Nine Zero! The party continued as we hung out in the luxe lobby and joked with Brian behind the desk who all took it in good stride ;) The next morning we went out to breakfast with our new friends. Both my friend and I absolutely loved how convenient the Nine Zero is to EVERYTHING. After grabbing some breakfast at a bakery nearby we hit Borders so she could grab a copy of the Boston magazine she had seen in our room that she wanted as a souvenir. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to check out our car until 2pm, so why not soak in the beautiful day? We walked around the Commons and went and saw the duck statues and sat by the pond. Later, when waiting for our car, I spoke some more with John about the recommendations he had made to us and he seemed pleased our night had turned out well and invited us to return soon. My friend lives in the S. Jersey/Philadelphia area, yet is already talking about how taking weekends to Boston would be so manageable. Not to mention, she never will stay anywhere else in Boston but the Nine Zero! I live closer, on the Cape, yet, I have to say I agree! I cannot stop singing their praises to anyone who will listen. The service beyond excellence only makes me want to stay at more Kimpton hotels on any other vacations/weekends I take! Seriously.

The Consierge, Tommy, happened to answer the telephone and happily added a note to our reservation noting that fact.

There was a Wii Fit in the lobby to entertain anyone who wanted to play it. We were a little early for check in and the room wasn't quite ready, but we were ushered into a cool lounge to wait for the room. The wait was worth it. Our room had been upgraded to a suite for our special stay. The suite was roomy and had beautiful furniture. It lacked a real view, but this was not a big deal since the room was so plush. When we returned from a walk through the public garden, the wine reception was going on. A delightful white sangria was a perfect cool off for the hot day. Up in our room, we found a tray with a bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries and a happy anniversary note written in chocolate.

There were all these different kinds of pillows you could pick from. The beds and linens were excellent. The location was great - we walked back and forth from Faneuil hall a few times. And the Common was right on the other side of us as well. The wine reception was great with good wine and hors d'oeuvres.

I travel to Boston frequently but have never stayed at Nine Zero. I have stayed at other Kimpton properties so I have pretty high expectations. I found this to be the worst of the Kimptons that I have had the pleasure of experiencing. 1) The rooms are small...which isn't a huge deal since I don't spend much time in the rooms. 2) The A/C in my room was ineffective. I had the A/C set to the coldest temperature but the room was very warm, even at night. I woke up several times each night because I was so hot. I had to sleep on top of the sheets and blankets. 3) The towels in the rooms are really thin and hard....they are in dire need of replacement. 4) The wifi went out for about 12 hours during the stay and there is no wired option that I could find. Luckily, I brought a cable to tether my computer to my Blackberry. When I first arrived to my room, the wifi worked. But, after returning from dinner, I had a signal and my computer said I was \"Connected,\" but I couldn't get on any sites. Mid-day on Saturday the wifi magically returned. (I am pretty tech experienced, so I know what I was doing.) 5) The service was friendly but, at times, incompetent. I called down for a few items that were promised and not delivered without second calls 45 minutes-1 hour later. 6) The hotel is really looking worn and soiled. The carpeting in the public areas is littered with lots of stains. On the flip side, I liked the Aveda products. And, the location is very convenient to the Govt. Center and Park Ave. T stops.

The showers were rather large and really neat, and beds/linens really comfy. Another highlight was upon check out. We needed a rental car asap to drive down to Cape Cod and catch a ferry and were on a huge time crunch. After attempting to rent one across the street and being told they were sold out we frantically approached the front desk for addresses of others to walk or cab to. A very helpful young man at the front desk made a phone call to a nearby rental company and requested a car be delivered to the hotel with priority rush.

We arrived at the hotel at 12:30 and Christina promptly informed us that no rooms were available at that time and to come back at 3, which is the official check in time. They must have been full the night before because we were told this without even being asked our name and looking in the system to see if our room was ready. No problem...we left our bags and headed out for the Freedom Trail. At about 4:15, we arrived back at the hotel and went to the front desk. Checkin was smooth and each guest is offered a glass of champagne at checkin. We decided we would rather have a coke and were instructed to take one from the mini bar. I fully expected these cokes to be charged to our room since this was not standard practice, but the charges have not yet shown up on my card statement (I did mention this at checkout and jokingly told the clerk that I would have to call him back tomorrow to have the charges removed and he said that he would see to it that it was taken care of). We were assigned room 1705. When I booked the hotel (using the best price guarantee over the phone), my reservation was for a Queen Deluxe room (the lowest room type). After emailing the concierge and inquiring about the cost of any available upgrades, Thomas informed us that he had upgraded us to a Queen Deluxe View room. Perfect!! If you look at the photos of the hotel building, the top four floors all have floor to ceiling wraparound windows, and we were lucky enough to be in one of these rooms. Room 1705 is a corner room facing the Boston Common with a divine view of Park Street Church, the State House, the river, and Back Bay. Absolutely could not have asked for a better view!!! The room itself was not large by any means, but comfortable enough with space for a working desk with chair beside the bed, a circular armoire housing the minibar and TV (a CRT-this is the first Kimpton I've stayed in without a flat screen), and a nice comfy chair with a view toward the corner of the room. The bed looked and felt larger than a queen to me, and was truly heavenly. We stayed at the Hotel Marlowe and the Mandarin Oriental also during this same trip, and this bed ran circles around the others in terms of comfort (and the other ones were comfy...this one just more so). There was also a coffee table with a couple of magazines, including a DuPont Registry. Could these people read my mind?? One of my favorite magazines anywhere!! Major brownie points there. The bathroom itself was a bit small with a standup shower and a sink with a view. The door to the bathroom was on a slider (picture a pocket door without one of the walls concealing the door) and got sticky with about a foot remaining until closed, making it extremely hard to shut completely. The armoire furniture was quite tired looking with chipped paint and a large section along the side which had clearly been repainted with flat black paint and didn't quite mesh with the original glossy black finish. Thomas also was nice enough to send up some chocolate covered strawberries and some sparkling apple juice (we requested this as apposed to champagne). YUM. We quickly found space in the mini fridge and saved them for later. When we walked into the room, it was extremely hot...about 77 degrees. It was an unseasonably hot day (high of about 90), and with all those windows and the sun beating down, the AC, while blowing cold air, just wasn't cutting it. We had the bellman manually turn the AC on high and he told us if it wasn't better in 10 minutes to call the engineer. In 5 minutes, I checked again and it was 78, in 10 it was 79. Okay...we are going the wrong direction here. In came the engineer, who could not have been more apologetic. He immediately began checking the wiring of both thermostats (yes-there were two thermostats in the room). We later discovered that these independently controlled each vent because we set the one in the hallway near the door on 70 before bed and when we woke up it was chily. We checked and the one in the hallway was on 70 but the one near the bed was still on 68 and the vent above it still dutifully blowing. 15 minutes after the engineer arrived, it was time to head to the Fenway for the Sox game. He promised us it would be cool when we returned to the room later that night. We hopped on the Green Line at the Park Street station, which is about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. After the game, we decided to walk all the way back to the hotel since it was so nice out. This was a pleasant 40 minute stroll down Newbury and through the Public Gardens and Boston Common back to the hotel. When we got back to the room, it was much cooler-what a relief! On Friday, checkout was slow. I believe the problem centered around the $10 allowance card to use in the minibar that Kimpton InTouch members receive. There seemed to be a problem applying this $10 credit to our bill. We eventually checked out and headed for the Blue Line towards the airport. We were there the night of 5/21 and checked out on 5/22, and thankfully didn't experience any of the water problems the previous reviewer did. Overall, the service we received prior to check in from Thomas was excellent, and our stay was excellent, but the tired looking armoire and the hot room kept me from giving it 5 stars. Thanks Thomas, and keep up the good work!!

That's one of the binding laws of Newtonian physics. That also applies to the Nine Zero hotel. It is an entity full of unrealized potential. They do something outstanding. Then they wipe the experience out with something silly. I have stayed in Kimpton hotels at least 100 times in the past 10 years. I know Kimpton for having very competent, non-robotic employees. If you stay in hotels a lot, you know what I mean. Usually, their people are so good that it is a bit shocking. You don't expect such presence or individuality in a hotel. However, here at the Nine Zero, they seem to have had a communication breakdown. The right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. In our case, they didn't know when the restaurant closed. Kimpton get big points and applause for their \"green\" record. They are loud and proud about it. But, then on a cold day, you wonder why the room temperature drops so rapidly. You follow the temperature gradient and it leads you to the obsolete windows. You feel the drafts around the window frame and realize where the heat is going. When you know that at least 1/3 of the energy expended to heat the room is flying out the window, it is hard to take their organo-groovy position seriously. Kimpton puts a lot of effort into design. Their rooms are interesting and functional. I cannot think of one that I was ever uncomfortable in... until this one. They put two queen sized beds in a space that just can't justify it. There was no place to open up luggage. We were tripping over each other. 1 person, 1 bag: OK. 2 people, 2 bags: NO-GO. Then there was the parking charge: $38. Cheeky. I'll take Boston over NY hands down, but they doesn't mean they get to charge ridiculous prices for things. Then there was the phone bill. $27 to call Lowell for 9 minutes. Lowell is just 30 minutes north of Boston. Add that to the $26 it cost to call New Jersey for 6 minutes and your blood begins to boil. After threatening never to stay at this hotel again, the reasonable woman in accounting agreed to reduce the charge to a reasonable $5. The restaurant KO Prime is horribly overpriced. There are better steaks for better prices elsewhere in Boston. (and you should be eating lobster anyway!) As for breakfast... their $12 French Toast is excellent, however, it is not twice as good as the $5 French Toast at Mike's City Diner. You want to hate them for their prices, but you can't because the wait staff is so nice. The same goes for the bar / lounge. The cocktails are very pricey. I would only drink there on a special occasion. Our special occasion was that we were snowed in! The price of the menu gives you gas pains, but then the talent of the bartenders somehow gives you relief. Again, action & reaction. All things considered, they barely justify their price. $239 / night (plus tax... CONSIDERABLE tax) should buy you more. At <$200, the NINE ZERO would be good deal. Don't write them off, though. Apathetic they are not. They have enough people striving to do the right thing that I expect they will make improvement.

It was on a whim that I thought of Boston so I rang up my travel agent to see if she had any weekend deals. I hadn't had time to do my research as I always usually do before I book a hotel but she knew the kind of hotels that we liked. She found a great deal for Nine Zero and told us that we would love it, so I trusted her judgement and went for it. We couldn't be more delighted that we did. When we arrived at Nine Zero, it was pretty late (about 10pm) because we had a nightmare with our flights and had been delayed in Philadelphia for a number of hours. So we were looking rather exhausted and bedraggled when we entered the beautiful lobby to say the least! So it was really nice to be greeted with a warm smile at the front desk when we checked in and we were immediately much more relaxed and at ease. We were given the keys to our room and we made our way up there through the gorgeously decorated public areas. It all felt so warm and welcoming and I'm sure that they have some kind of scent pumping through the heating or air con vents because the hotel even smelt beautiful! When we got to our room, we were absolutely delighted with it. It was spacious, clean and was decorated beautifully. The bathroom was lovely and the shower was great with really good pressure. The tolietries were gorgeous too. We found the bed really comfortable and everything that we could have wanted was in the room. We felt completely at home. The view out of the window was really pretty too. Because we had arrived at the hotel so late, we didn't really want to venture out to look for somewhere to eat so we decided to order room service on our first night. I rang up and ordered our meals and was told that it would be about 15 minutes. Over half an hour later, it still hadn't arrived so I rang up to check where it was. I wouldn't normally do that but we were so tired, having been on the go for almost 24 hours with no sleep and no opportunity to eat since the flight to Philadelphia. All we really wanted to do have dinner quickly and go straight to sleep. We were told that there had been a rush on in the restuarant but that it would arrive at any minute, and I almost felt a bit guilty for ringing up! Sure enough, it arrived soon afterwards and the lady who brought the food couldn't apologise enough. She even asked if there was anything we'd like to make up for the inconvenience which was very kind, although we didn't take her up on the offer. We just ordered cheeseburgers and fries and I have to say, that it really was tasty. It was fresh and hot, although the portion size was too much for us! My husband and I never happened to be in the hotel during the wine hour but it is a lovely little extra and a nice way for guests to socialise. The location of the hotel was absolutely superb. It was about a 10 minute walk to Quincy Market, 5 minutes to Downtown Crossing and probably less than 5 minutes to Boston Common.

It's got a fantastic location near Boston Common and Downtown Crossing, with easy access to both the green line (e.g: back bay) and blue line (e.g: airport). The hotel is tastefully decorated, and everywhere from the lobby, elevator, room and bathroom were well lit and arranged. It even smelled nice and fresh. The staff was excellent and friendly, eager to help and provided very useful information. They all seemed to carry a genuine smile and happy to do their job. For example, I asked where to find the boston Duck Tour (highly recommended btw), and I was immediately informed of the two closest locations around the hotel, but she referred me to the concierge desk to book the tour in advance just in case. The gentleman at the concierge was equally friendly, and offered concise directions on where to locate the duck tour at the Prudential center. Furthermore, we were fortunate to find out in advance that the Saturday tour was already fully booked, and we quickly snatched a preferred time on the next day. All of this was done by the Hotel concierge desk without extra charge. In addition, he recommended that at the end of the Freedom Trail we could ride a ferry from Charlestown back to Long Wharf. That's valuable information I didn't have, and was glad to save a bunch of walking time. I just have two minor criticisms: (1) could use a little more towel hanging space in the bathroom, and (2) the air conditioner was very cold, and the room remained pretty cold even after I turned it off, but it's manageable. I will definitely return to this hotel in the future. Great location, great room and great service all at a good price.

It's excellently placed for sight seeing in Boston, which is frankly a small and accessible/easily navigable city. We never ate in the restaurant but it seemed very much 'the' place for out of towners 'in the know' and locals alike. We chilled in the bar, where the bar staff were cool and reserved, but polite and quite sweet - letting my mum and I taste the cockails before we decided what to have next! This hotel has two main drawbacks; firstly, the heinously expensive mini bar - easily addressed by staying out or frequenting the 7 Eleven down the street! the second issue is slightly harder to resolve - our room looked out over a side street which obviously housed the bottle banks and trash bins for nearby bars, or perhaps the hotel's own. Whatever - the noise of rubbish and glass being thrown into the bins, and then the early morning street cleaners was pretty disturbing. The hotel should invest in some better soundproofing for these rooms - this is not a bargain basement hostel - at these prices and with the level of comfort and style offered in the rooms, this really tainted the otherwise great experience.

Also, on my first visit the robes and towels were Frette and that was no longer the case. The Mario Russo products were great but seemed to be smaller in size. And the cheap plastic made it difficult to actually get the shampoo or conditioner out. And, as mentioned in another review...it is a little tacky that there are so many things for sale in the room. The bed was super comfortable and very roomy. A luggage rack would have been nice. One great addition from my last stay was the evening cocktail hour. Nice wines were served in the lobby from 5-6. A nice touch. Staff was friendly and helpful. Needed some extra soap and it was sent up promptly. As instructed, when I needed my car I called about a half hour before hand.

The staff member who took me up there was extremely helpful and informative and very keen to tell me what a great Hotel this was to work for. This atmosphere comes across. We asked for a high room and were pleased to be on the 17th floor with a great view State House, it was a very quiet room. We had breakfast once, I can highly recommend the pancakes we ate out other times. We tried The Paramount in Charles street, Down the hill (Beacon Street) and on the right. get there early and enjoy the atmosphere, it is not a place for lingering but worth going to. Charles Street has some wonderful older shops to browse in once you have had breakfast. There are a lot of coffee shops around the Hotel but not so many breakfast places, if you want more than bagels and muffins. Not many diners, there is one down the hill at South Street though. Restaurants we enjoyed and were recommended to us by a Bostonian friend were Mooo just around the corner in beacon Street from the Hotel, not cheap but good quality and atmosphere. The hotel bar on the 2nd floor was great, plus the bar food. The Beantown Pub next door is a great place to watch sport and have a beer and bar food and a game of pool. Plus not far to get back to the Hotel! The Daily Catch is a small restaurant that you would pass by without a thought in Hanover Street North End. I was told to go there and did so for a late lunch...wonderful. A handed down family run restaurant with seafood that melts in your mouth. In the evening people queue aroudn the block so my recommendation would be a late lunch after whale watching if you take the 10.30 boat. You have to pay in cash though so beware! Whale watching was fantastic if you want to get out of the City for a few hours. The Boston Harbour Cruise catamaran was fast, clean and has marine biologists on board giving great information and collecting data.. Well worth the trip as was a day trip to Salem if you have time... A CIty trolly tour is a must when you first arrive to get an idea of what is where and some history.

The hotel is a few steps away from the subway (Park St station, Red and Green line), and close to Boston Commons. Area is also safe (we came back late at around 10-11pm every night). About the hotel : we reserved our room through the hotel website, which gave a much cheaper rate than if you called the hotel directly. On the website, it asked whether you want 'higher floor, or lower', and whether you want 'feather pillows or foam'. We asked for a room on the higher floor, and feather pillows, and both requests were accommodated when we arrived. We were given a room on the 18th floor, with a beautiful view of the State House. Pillows and bed are very comfortable. Sheets are very clean. Hotel has a chic feel, smells nice as soon as you walk in. The interior decor of the room and the hotel can be interpreted as either stylish or tacky, but these are not major issues for me as I much prefer hotel to be clean, which the Nine Zero is. We also used the hotel gym, and although it is rather on the small side, it is functional, clean, doesn't smell, and it has good equipment. One thing we really liked was the in-room safe which is designed to accommodate laptop computers. We put our two laptop computers in it everytime we went out. Some issues : 1) housekeeping didn't replenish the body soap when they cleaned our room. We wondered whether they forgot about it. No big deal. When we came back from walking around Boston that night, we just stopped at the front desk to ask for soap, and they readily accommodated us, and even asked whether they should call housekeeping to replenish us with more. Very professional and accommodating. 2) Second issue : On the brochure in the room itself, it stated that there's 'complimentary coffee' somewhere in the hotel (I forgot where, lobby perhaps), but when I called front desk to inquire about it, they said they don't have complimentary coffee, but coffee could be bought at the hotel restaurant. Hmmm. If you don't have it, then don't say it on the brochure ! Probably they changed the policy, which is fine, but the info given to customers in the brochures should be updated as well. Oh, by the way, room doesn't come with coffee maker or coffee, but they do have margarita mix ! All in all, it was a very good and very satisfying stay. Staff is professional and friendly. Nine Zero tends to be on the expensive side (we paid around $375 per night for our room), but the hotel is nice, clean, with comfortable bed and pillows, clean towels, crisp sheets, very close to subway. There's Dunkin Donuts and Finagle Bagel a block away for your morning coffee and breakfast.

There's also a nearby \"T\" (subway) station about a block away. We found the hotel to be so conveniently located that once we handed our car keys to the valet at check-in, we didn't need them again until we checked out. The hotel's somewhat minimalist decor can best be described as \"urban chic\". The hotel offers complementary wine tastings nightly in the hotel lobby, which is a fantastic amenity. The Nine Zero's well-trained staff is very professional, gracious and accommodating. Room: As a \"Kimpton in Touch\" member I got a very reasonable \"One Day Sale\" rate of $209 for a King Premier Room (compared to the $279 weekend rack rate). I must admit that due to the \"territory-marking behavior\" of dogs I was skeptical of staying at a \"pet-friendly\" property, but my concerns were unfounded. The room was very clean and stylishly decorated. The extremely comfortable king-sized bed had plush linens, a warm down comforter and the softest down pillows we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever slept on. The marble bathroom was very nice and my wife loved the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deluxe toiletries. The room and bathroom were more spacious than most standard city hotel rooms. Among the many appreciated in-room amenities were chocolate truffles and raspberries at nightly turndown. For those travelling on business, there's free high speed Internet and wireless connectivity in each room. Dining: We had dinner at \"KO Prime\", an innovative steakhouse located on the hotel's second floor. KO Prime is an extraordinary restaurant named after renowned Executive Chef Ken Oringer (formally of the Boston Eliot Hotel's Mobil 4-Star restaurant \"Clio\"). The appetizers, sides, entrees and desserts were all delicious, portions were generous, the service and presentation were superb and the wine list was impressive. The restaurant's \"hip\" atmosphere was trendy but refined. Like most fine restaurants, KO Prime is somewhat pricey - plan on spending $100 per person for a four-course dinner not including wine (if you order the Kobe Beef, plan on spending at least twice that per person). Most of the reds on the wine list were priced between $100 to $150 per bottle (there were few offerings below that). In fact, my only complaint about the restaurant is that the wine list markup seemed excessive to me. (I have a small wine cellar at home consisting mainly of Barolo, Barbaresco and red Bordeaux, so I consider myself to be pretty good at \"cherry picking\" limited-production/good value reds off of restaurant wine lists). These days, I can usually find a very good/delicious 1996-2001 Barolo or Barbaresco or \"Cru Classe\" Bordeaux from a better producer for around $80, which I consider to be a relatively good value at finer restaurants. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a good value at that price point on KO Prime's wine list. Despite this, KO Prime is definitely worth visiting for a special occasion. Overall, the Nine Zero is a wonderful city hotel in a great location... The \"One Day Sale\" rate of $209 was also a great value... We'd definitely stay here again!", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel needs to get it together!!!\u201d", "Author": "Jrjetsetter", "ReviewID": "UR10839491", "Content": "I loved Boston!!!...but this hotel was horrible!

Upon arrival (which was tough because we drove into Boston and unfortunately missed the small alley off Tremont St. where the valet is located), we were warmly greeted by the friendly staff. Our room was ready even though we were early. The room was small but comfortable, and the bathroom was perfectly fine for us in terms of counter space for toiletries, etc. I left the room in disarray as we rushed to make our dinner reservations on time (that the concierge made for us at Bricco, excellent choice) and when we returned, we found everything neatly stacked and our bed turned down, soft music playing, chocolate truffles, and the ice bucket full. We enjoyed watching the Red Sox game 7 of the AL championships on the tv which we thought was fine for the room. We don't travel to watch tv and don't have a flat screen at home either so we didn't mind that it was a regular television. Upon our arrival earlier in the day, we had let the bellman know that the blinds in our room were not working. A maintenance man was sent up immediately, but he could not fix them as they were broken. I didn't think much of it at the time as we were leaving the room and when we returned it was evening. However, on the 2nd day when we returned to our room at 3:00pm, the room was scorching hot and we could not get comfortable with that sun beating down on us in the room. I went downstairs to get scotch tape to tape down the blinds because the towel I tried to block the sun with kept falling. As I was asking for the tape, I realized how ludicrous it was for me to be taping down a blind in a $450.00 a night room. I give Nine Zero credit for superb customer service because once the front desk manager saw how upset I was getting over the situation he remedied it immediately by moving us to another room for the night -- a much superior room which my husband and I luxuriated in for our last evening in Boston. We would most definitely stay at Nine Zero again for its excellent location at Boston Common, the chic, modern surroundings, but most importantly for the outstanding service and treatment we received as guests of the hotel.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "the bay", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "crusaderS510", "ReviewID": "UR10301252", "Content": "Great boutique hotel.

It was a bit on the small size.. considerable smaller than the average size hotel room but I felt very comfortable while staying in it. My room offered a decent size bathroom with a stand-up shower-l arge enough for two, it was very clean, and house keeping comes by twice a day to make sure you have clean towels. My bed was very, very comfortable, furnished with a down comforter, and down pillows. The room also offers free high speed internet and a desk to do work if needed. Their was a cd player and a complintary cd in the player to listen to during my stay..I enjoyed it very much that I purchased it before leaving. The tv featured all the local channels, cable channels and the latest movies for order. The armour was very nice but not large enough for more than one person so if you are not traveling alone, keeping your clothing in your suitcase seems to be your only option. The room also features a mini bar with snacks and refreshments, including, water, soda, wines and liquors all for purchase...HOWEVER, i do recommend you finding a liquor store nearby if you plan on having a drink in the room.. and picking up all your needed items because a small (one shot) bottle of Belveder Vodka was $9.50. Snacks were condsiderably reasonable but if you dont want to spend unnecessary money..stop at a local store! Room service was OK. If traveling on the weekend, give yourself about 45 minutes to order because it takes that much time for them to arrive due to many orders. Breakfast is served from 6:00AM- 11:00AM and they do not take any breakfast orders after that so don't call past that time if you are looking to eat breakfast in. As far as the menu- for breakfast.. their is not a great deal to choose from but the french toast and smoked bacon was pretty good but ask for extra maple syrup on the side if you enjoy syrup because they hardly give you any. as far as dinner and desserts... i enjoy salt with my food but the food was EXCEPTIONALLY SALTY.... the lobster sandwich with fries was pretty good but do not get your hands on the ceaser salad if you have high blood pressure because it is wayyy too salty..as far as dessert . they offer only two sweets..the chocoate bread pudding, and the coffee cream brulee..if you enjoy bread pudding which is why i ordered it, you will be very disappointed because it did not taste anything like it! they also offer coffee-cream brule but that was pretty good As far as the fitness room, it was also very small but managable and noone is ever in it so working out in there was very nice because I felt like it was my own room. As far as the hotel resaurant ko prime I never had the chance to eat in there but Its decor was very nice. As far as nearby dining, lucca Restaurant was great! It is located on Hanover street in the heart of Boston's little itay. I ordered the antipasta for two which was very good and I had the beef tenderloin which was excellent and the service was up to par. Tresca was also very good.

The modern design of the bathroom--and the glass shower in particular--was a problem, in that the shower door leaked water on to the floor and had to be fixed. Also, several channels on the Direct TV feed froze, and required a call to get them working. Finally, the hotel's highly praised restaurant just recently closed--it changed names and format (the previous chef left to open his own reataurant), and the new menu and prices did not look good enough to attract us for dinner.

The walls were dirty, the sink and floor in the bathroom had splotches and sticky patches, the drinking glasses were dirty, the upholstery and carpet had spots and stains, and the bathrobes were frayed and worn; (2) On the second morning, I ordered a french omelette off their room service menu, as I had done the day before. Twenty minutes later, I got a call from room service asking me what the ingredients were for a french omelette. I told the person that I wasn't sure exactly but didn't they know since it was on their menu? She told me that the french omelette was not on their menu. I told her that I had ordered the same thing the day before from their menu, which was sitting in front of me! 45 minutes after I initially ordered, my french omelette did arrive -- and was delicious as usual -- but this was an annoying interlude on a busy morning; (3) Both mornings, the housekeeper knocked once on my door and before I could get to the door to see who it was, had unlocked the door and entered my room (this is not reassuring for women traveling alone); (4) There were errors on my bill which had to be ironed out -- a valet parking charge when I didn't even have a car.

And I do not say this lightly - I'm a very seasoned traveller and have over 50 hotel nights per year. This is not a cheap place (I paid $400 per night, but it was worth it). So, with great expectations I returned in October. I'm a very light sleeper so my assistant had requested a quiet room on a high floor. (And last time it worked perfectly). Not such luck this time although thispreference is also clearly stated in my Kimpton frequent quest profile. I was given a room 1502 - high floor, but so much street noise that I had 3 very poorly slept nights. The housekeeping, which as impeccable last time, left a lot of room for improvement this time around: the empty shower gel bottle stood in the shower for 3 days and a new one was not provided until I called and requested one (most annoying when you're wet in the shower already and notice this). The sheets were so worn that there literally was a hole in it! You would expect this in a cheap budget hotel but not in a place like Nine Zero... Then the room service. On both mornings I ordered a big pot of green tea. On the first day the pot of hot water came with 8 tea bags (which was a bit excessive, but at least enough) on the second morning I just got one (with a big pot of water and with at $10 price tag not quite what I expected). When I requested a second tea bag from the waitress, I was told that I can have one only if I pay extra ($5). Granted, I'm on an expense account and it doesn't matter, but this kind of greediness gives a very poor overall impression of the hotel's mentality. And about the Spire restaurant; the menu had 3 seafood choices (I don't eat meat) of which 2 were \"sold out\". What was most annoying was that we were not told about this in the beginning, but only after we had already made our selections. At that point the waitress told us: \"Oh, we don't have that anymore tonight. No, that neither.\" Overall my second visit didn't meet my expectations, but that might've been partly do to the fact that the hotel seemed to be fully booked., which was not the case during my first visit.

The outside of the hotel is brick and looks like a lot of the other buildings in this city. However, its insides are quite modern and sleek making for an enjoyable contrast in such a historic town. The hotel is located on the Freedom Trail directly across the street from the very old Granary Cemetary. Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, and the parents of Benjamin Franklin (among others) are buried there. Our corner room allowed us a terrific people watching view, including the groups taking tours led by people dressed in revolutionary period clothing. Boston is known as a walking city and almost everything is within walking distance from this hotel. The financial district is in one direction and the theater district in another. One edge of Boston Common (the furthest side from the Public Garden) is 1block away to the south. You can choose from high end stores and dining on Newbury Street at the end of the Public Garden or find moderate shopping and fast food on Washinton Street, which is one city block to the east of Nine Zero. The Park Street \"T\" (subway) station is only 1 block away, too. Both the red line and green line trains can be taken from this station for $1.25 per person per ride. The red line (outbound) will take you over to Cambridge and the green line will take you to Fenway Park or up to the North End. You could also transfer from the green line to the blue line, which takes you to the wharf. Don't panic if this sounds complicated. It's not! The friendly and very helpful concierge at the hotel provided us with a clearly marked map and very easy to follow directions. The decor of this hotel is modern. Our room was nicely sized and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. The bath was stocked with Mario Russo (a local salon) products. The sea salt soap is divine!! Our room was so comfortable we decided to have dinner via room service one night. It was delivered hot & quickly and it was delicious. Note: When we were calling to place our dinner order, the line to room service rang a few times so the call was automatically routed to the front desk. Instead of trying to transfer us back to that line, the front desk person took our order! This was a very nice customer service touch. The only quirk to the Nine Zero hotel is finding a few items tucked into dresser drawers. We discovered our coffee maker in one drawer after already grabbing some coffee from Starbucks around the corner. Also, housekeeping came by bright and early on a Saturday morning but we didn't find our \"do not disturb\" hanger (in another drawer) until a day too late. Very, very minor for an otherwise outstanding stay.

One of my biggest pet peeves is showers with low water pressure, I was quite pleased with the copious water pressure and plentiful hot water at the Nine Zero.

That is most certainly the case. During our stay, Louis Farrahkan (and a huge entourage) as well as the Black Eyed Peas, also stayed here. The hotel was definitely buzzing. Nonetheless, the staff stayed on top of their game throughout the week - always polite and efficient and even quite friendly. That much was fun. Only exception was when we tried to get a DVD player they brushed us off, eventually admitting there is only one in the hotel and it was lent out indefinitely. When I called again the next day and asked about a wait list I was discouraged from this and then told I probably wouldn't want it anyway since it was attached to a 13 inch television. We were far from impressed by the overall tech features of this hotel, even though it tries to brand itself as being high tech. More on that below. The rooms, however, are a royal pain. The beds are very comfy, and that's vital for me in any hotel stay (a main reason I steer clear of most Marriotts nowadays). Unfortunately, many details are either inconvenient or just plain nonfunctioinal. For example, you simply cannot turn on the shower without getting your face, shoulder and arm blasted with cold water. This is in addition to a very cool looking sliding barn door on the bathroom that will slam your fingers if you're not paying attention. I thought I was just an idiot when I did this so didn't mention it to my boyfriend and he ended up slamming his hand in the door later that day. Also, there are no towel racks. After four days of staying here, I finally improvised a towel rack above the toilet, but housekeeping steathily removed and corrected these attempts, folding and replacing the towels below the sink, where they were unreachable from the shower. Another annoying feature - while they do have free wi-fi, it's very spotty. My boyfriend kept cursing every time he got booted. I got frustrated at the waxing and waning of the connection - you developed a rushed mentality whenever a strong signal appeared and tried to get everything done. This was compounded by the fact that there are no electrical outlets near the bed. Since my boyfriend was constantly at the desk working, god bless his productive soul, and the arm chair was unattractively squashed into the corner, the only other place to use your computer was on the bed. I had to constantly try to remember to plug my laptop back in to juice up the battery. Since we're locals (ousted by renovations), things like our gym being nearby and a big movie complex are great. Btw, the gym here is subpar for a nice new hotel. The SCLA is down the block, attached to the Ritz, and the nicest gym in Boston. Not cheap, but excellent facilities. The climate control, as I mentioned above, is not very precise. It is not digital and when it's on, it's hard to keep it below freezing. Not a problem during the day, but at night it's freeze or burn. When I brought this to management's attention, they offered to switch my room but said all rooms were the same in this regard. As mentioned by others, check Expedia, they have great rates. We paid $229 the first three nights and when I checked Expedia prior to renewing, I saw a quoted rate of $185. I told the front desk this and after some haggling they extended my stay for $189. They initially told me I would have to downgrade rooms for this rate. They said I had been upgraded to the second level upon check-in. This second tier room is supposedly identical to the standard room but has a view. When I pointed out to the front desk that this room has no view without pressing your face to the window, they let us stay. This hotel is a good value. Many Boston hotel rooms (Park Plaza, The Omni) are older and not updated. I like The Charles Hotel in Cambridge - free DVD player in room, large rooms, nice views, nice area. I also like the Marriott Longwharf - large comfy rooms and the best doormen in the city, but this hotel has some great rates available.", "Date": "August 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved Nine Zero\u201d", "Author": "TejasGirl", "ReviewID": "UR3803643", "Content": "I stayed the weekend of May 27th-30th to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday.

First, we booked a suite. Big mistake. All suites are located on lower floors and have just one window that look out to an office building on Tremont Street. For nearly $650/night, we found ourselves in a dark room (the bedroom had no windows to speak of). Second, we told the hotel we were traveling with a child and repeatedly requested a crib for our baby. When we arrived, no crib. When the crib did come it was old, rickety and not all that safe. Moreover, there was no room for the crib in the bedroom and the hotel concierge suggested that we push it up against the wall facing the open electrical outlets. We understand that not all hotels are outfitted to cater to children, but having made the explicit request well in advance, we had expected at least our room to be child friendly. Third, our room was in a state of disrepair. Food stains on the couch, lampshades that had burn marks from where the lightbulb had burned through, hair in the bathtub, and enough grit on the carpet that it wasn't pleasant walking barefoot through the room. Even the hotel acknowledged that our $650/night room was sub-par. Fourth, the service was not in keeping with its rating at all. We complained to the hotel manager who never showed his face. We got one voicemail message and that was it. Never heard from him again. After repeated complaints to the front desk, they knocked off $100/night on our room which didn't seem like adequate consolation, but we were just so glad to be out of the hotel we did not care at that point. We are not picky travelers who require every pillow to be fluffed and duvets to be \"just so.\" We just require value for the money we are spending. I am pretty sure that had we stayed at the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton, the service and amenities would have been worth the money we paid.

But, its central location does mean that you're close to everything: from a cheap breakfast at Quincy Market to cheap shopping at Downtown Crossing. A cheap breakfast? Well, the Spires restaurant did a splendid breakfast, for $19: really tasty, nice, relaxed, in a splendid restaurant with a great corner-view. But, Quincy Market does a breakfast which is almost exactly as tasty, for $4.50. And, much as I enjoy having a smart waiter trotting up to me every five minutes and asking whether everything's okay there and can I get anything else, I enjoy having another $15, per person, for buying Sam Adams with later in the day.

It's a nice place to be, but you might find, as we did, that the local pubs are cheaper and rather more friendly.

The duvet is very warm and comfy as well. The room is decorated in earth tones and the furniture is very modern, black, but very functional. The one thing we did laugh at was that it seemed like everything in the room had a price tag. There is a price list in the entertainment center that gives you the price for snacks and drinks, but also t-shirts, stuffed bear, playing cards, baseball caps and even a condom set all bearing the Nine Zero name and logo! You can even buy the Mario Russo products in the bathroom from them! The bathroom was a good size, decorated in white and gray marble. The aforementioned Mario Russo products were very nice. I would have loved a double vanity, but the space did not seem to be an issue with just one sink. The fitness center is pretty basic but all you would need at a hotel. The business center on the third floor was convenient as I needed to send and receive faxes during the trip. The hotel provides complimentary high speed interest access in all rooms, which was very nice, except that I got 5 viruses over the weekend that I needed to have removed from my laptop. Our only complaint was that the room did get a bit warm at night in spite of turning the air control all the way to the cool setting. While it may have been 30 degrees outside, the room was a bit stuffy overnight because they pumped in heated air regardless of your individual control settings. As far as the location, the hotel is in a pretty quiet area at night. During week days, it is a bit more animated as the business district is to the back of the hotel. The hotel is about two blocks from the Government Center T stop and about two blocks in the other direction from the Park Street T stop at Boston Common. This makes it very easy to get around the city on the various subway lines. While we took a taxi cab in the night we got in, we walked over to the Government Center T stop the last day and caught the subway to the Airport stop. It cost only $1.25 a person and took only 15 minutes. You then board a bus from the station that takes you directly to your departing terminal.

The room was very clean, the linen nice and comfortable to sleep on and the views of the commons magic. This hotel scores very high on my list, to give an example...After my stay at the nine zero i proceeded on to chicago, on my return from chicago, en route to the UK, i had to stop over at Logan airport. My plane was leaving for the U.K approx 7 hrs later and there was nowhere to check my luggage in--I contacted the nine zero and they offered to keep my luggage while i used up time walking around Boston, not only that, I was offerd a room at a really knock down rate to refresh myself in before i left fo the U.K en route to S.A Now thats what i call client service from a magic, modern well appointed and situated clean and well staffed hotel. If I ever return guess where i will stay...no prizes for guessing right", "Date": "March 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield MO", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3247543", "Content": "I stayed at Nine Zero in Boston and was able to stay on the top floor for only 125.00USD per night.

Sure, you can find less pricey places to stay, but there are so many good things about the Nine Zero that I find it to be worth every penny. The location cannot be beat.

The decor of the hotel is beautiful, but then I'm all about clean, modern design. The rooms are very well-kept and contain all the necessary amenities. Even having purchased my reservations through Expedia on each occasion I've stayed at the Nine Zero, I am still greeted with a \"welcome back!\" when I check in. The staff is efficient and helpful. The conceirge went out of her way in setting up a shuttle to the airport for me and delivering documentation directly to my room. I'm not a usual \"talk to the concierge\" kind of person, so maybe I should have expected all of that. But I was impressed that, for such a slight little arrangement that they even managed to make me feel as if I were being pampered. I enjoyed eating in Spire and found the food to be well above average. Upon asking a few questions of my wait person, regarding preparation of the dinner I was eating, the chef came out to answer the questions personally.

Perhaps the best part was the location- right off of Boston Common, you can walk almost anywhere in a hurry (plus, the T station is a block away on the direct line to Harvard).
