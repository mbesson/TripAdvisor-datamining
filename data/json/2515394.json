Beds were comfy, no noise in foyers or from other rooms could be heard, everything in room worked (fridge, alarm clock, etc etc) Only thing I'll fault the room on was there was a red wine stain on the floor. Service from reception/concierge was excellent-we were really impressed with their local knowledge and advice. The location was perfect for us as we went to a Mariners game and wandered around the streets shopping. We used the pool but didnt eat at the restaurant. Late check out was ideal!

They're smaller, cheaper, and yet still cozy. The staff were friendly and helpful. The lobby is large and inviting. We had a lake-view room on the third floor with a king bed and sofabed. There was also a large TV and a desk. The room felt a little cramped, but the bed was comfortable, and everything was clean. The only downside, which was really quite disappointing, was that the hotel was quite cold, but when we turned up the heat and the external heater in the corner by the window got started, it smelled like it was going to burn the place down. Not pleasant. So we turned it off and buried under the covers instead. Other than that, we enjoyed our short stay here. It's within walking distance of the Space Needle, which is an obvious must-see in Seattle. Also, our room was located to the side of the hotel (to the right, when looking at the lake) and it was at an angle where we could see into other people's rooms, and they could see into ours. For this reason, we kept the curtains closed for privacy. Staring into other rooms isn't my favourite... We had to depart from the hotel at 4am the following morning to catch a flight, so we spoke to the front desk staff the night before, asking about cab fare to the airport. We were told that the flat rate is $40-45 to the airport, and that they could have a towncar waiting for us at 4am to drive us there for $40. A towncar was also spontaneously summoned to drive us to the Space Needle (really no point in driving there) for a mere $7. It seemed towncars were more common than cabs, and we were told by the bus driver who brought us into Seattle that they would cost the same. We also took one from the Greyhound bus station to the hotel, for another mere $7. We didn't take any cabs. And as promised, we received a call to our room at 4am the next morning informing us that our towncar was waiting. It ended up being a large, black, luxury SUV. For $40. I'm very grateful that the hotel staff were so willing and helpful when it came to transportation, as this was our first time in Seattle. It was also, however, the highlight of our stay. Not to say that there is anything wrong with this hotel, just that it's an average hotel with very nice staff. We were happy with our choice of staying here, as the price was great in comparison to other Marriott-brand hotels in the area (as we are Marriott Reward members) and we did get a nice view of the lake and watch a seaplane land.

But this hotel is in desperate need of upgrades - at the very least. There are changes in the area with Amazon expanding its campus right up to the lake and the recently constructed apartment houses behind putting this hotel in harm's way. I honestly don't know if the structure can survive as a hotel, but time will tell. Whether it's this consideration or not, the decor here is extremely depressing - dark carpeting, dark and aging furniture, very uncomfortable mattresses. The room was clean, the wifi free and good, and again, the service was notable. But this is Seattle, dark and grey most of the time as it is. The property needs to be decorated with color and light. It's also mere steps away from a corner of Lake Union, with some of the rooms overlooking the Lake - this gives an opportunity to bring a brighter theme to the hotel, updating and freshening the accommodations as well as providing a generally more uplifting environment. We had meetings on-site, and while the meeting room was spacious, it also was difficult to keep cool and hear people speaking as the air conditioning is noisy. The service was also a little off timing, morning coffee service showed up about 10 minutes before the morning break service, which showed up around 10 minutes before lunch! Otherwise, the room was well equipped technically, we had ample power for 30+ technogeeks, projection screen, whiteboard and solid wifi. Good luck to this property, the people were great, the location unstable, the property in need of desperate upgrades but the pressures do seem largely external and if it is as I suspect, the decision to not upgrade the property until the area stabilizes or doesn't, it isn't wise business to spend a lot of money for the upgrade.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesapeake, VA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, good location, very helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "red0099", "ReviewID": "UR116271214", "Content": "This is a very nice location near downtown, just across the street from Lake Union.

We had a view of a usually empty parking lot next to the hotel but our room was quiet and really how much time do you usually spend looking out the windows of hotel rooms. The room rates are high and the parking fee is very high in my opinion but there is no free parking in Seattle. I did like the free wireless, which had decent speed. The computer in the business center is an antique and should be recycled. By the way, plentiful parking is cheaper in the lot right behind the hotel and the area seems safe enough", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Meath", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly fine hotel, but please sort out your Internet!\u201d", "Author": "Accentmonkey", "ReviewID": "UR82340282", "Content": "The hotel is clean, the bed is comfortable, the location is excellent (yes, I have one of the parking-lot-view rooms, but you can also see the Space Needle from here, which I like), the staff are friendly.

We recently used this hotel to accommodate guests for our wedding at the adjacent Virginia V (which was incredible). While they didn't drop the ball entirely, they definitely left some things to be desired. First off, coordinating our wedding block proved to be more difficult than we would have imagined, though for this we blame Marriott more than this specific location. The planners for wedding blocks seem to be located at corporate headquarters and as a result it was often difficult to get consistent information regarding our local block. When we tried to get info from this location we were always told that they couldn't do anything and we needed to contact the above mentioned planners. We arranged for our guests to receive gift bags we had put together as they checked into the hotel. However, as we spoke to our guests we came to find out that a number of them had not received their bags upon arrival. The first room they put us in (again the bride and groom, which they were aware of) had views of the building's ventilation systems and stains on the walls. While they were quick to give us another room, it was kind of disheartening to be given that room in the first place. In addition, a large number of our guests were placed in rooms with equally bad views, which isn't so bad except for the fact that they sell you on the views when you're checking the place out as a possible venue. Finally, on our last night we were hanging out with some friends in our room (about 5 total) around 3AM. We were keeping it fairly quiet, but management came up and knocked on the door. Fair enough, it wasn't early and I can appreciate the situation. However, instead of asking us to keep it down we were told, \"If we have to come up here again we will kick you all out of the hotel.\" It was not the warning but the manner in which it was given that we found offensive. While we understand the issue of noise complaints, we did bring them thousands of dollars of business and a little tact might have been appreciated. Threats don't typically make you feel like a valued customer. Anyway, the purpose of this review was to relay our experience to anyone who might be thinking of using this hotel to accommodate a large number of guests.

Unfortunately, by the time the pull-out was extended, there wasn't much floor space left in what had initially appeared to be a comfortable room. When we checked at Reception about the continental breakfast we were informed there wasn't one but we could purchase a buffet breakfast (forget the cost, but it certainly wasn't cheap).

No real character. The rooms are spacious, and provide all you would need. Our view was a huge construction site but that did not disturb us. The main fault with this hotel is the location. The lake is beautiful but there was not much made of it - i.e. bars, rstaurants etc... (except Hooters!). The walk into downtown Seattle was not too far but was through busy roads, and unsavoury areas. The Shuttle was available - although we booked twice on it at the front desk but twice were told there was not enough room. It is visibly close to the Space Needle but again it is difficult to get to. The roads around this area are extremely busy and there are no really safe places to cross the roads (around the hotel). The location really spoilt our trip as there is lots to do in Seattle, but we spent a lot of time getting back to the hotel. Overall an average hotel that is extremely expencsive for what it is. The cleaners were exceptional but that it is it. Our bill was incorrect, (twice), and staff were rude when tackled about it. There were always lots of staff at the front desk - too many cooks??? Costs 35 dollars in a taxi from Sea-Tac and 30 (for two people) in a Shuttle Express.", "Date": "August 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cWarning - Construction site next door!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3704179", "Content": "Stayed for a weekend in July 2005. Overall, this Courtyard is exactly what you would expect...decent service and clean comfortably appointed rooms. The beds were actually on the high end of the comfy scale. However (and to us it was a big one), there is a construction site across the street from the back side of the hotel. The rooms without a lake view look onto the site. The noise was pretty loud in our room on the back side. After discovering that the construction crew starts work at 7am on Saturday mornings, we requested to change rooms to the front side of the hotel. After some attitude from the staff who told us the noise was not the hotel's fault (duh), we were moved to a room on the side where the noise was still pretty bad on Monday morning.

Rooms were great...somebody in 2004 wrote a review saying the rooms were drab. This was not at all the case when we were there. I heard that the hotel was recently remodelled, so this might explain it. 3. The common areas of the hotel are very nice, too. Great equipment in the fitness room, a nice, roomy lobby with free apples and coffee in the morning, cookies in the afternoon. 4. Staff was responsive and friendly. 5. Free internet access in rooms.

I used the free shuttle to go to the Seattle Center and the Experience Music Project and to Pike Place Market and it was very easy to get around town--they also stop at several other locations. Be sure to ask at the Front Desk for suggestion on where to visit--everyone was very friendly and make your reservations for the Shuttle--it runs 7-11 pm daily. The rooms have been recently upgraded ---everything was very clean and new--including the carpet! One of the best things about the Courtyard is the free Internet in the rooms, which is very easy to use--no complicated set up. The hotel has a great restaurant that looks out over Lake Union and is open for breakfast and dinner. The breakfast buffet is extensive and very good--you can even make your own waffles. You can have dinner in the restaurant and watch the lights on Lake Union or in the lounge next to the fireplace. The food quality and selection were very good, especially the Calamari and Salmon Caesar Salad. The restaurant and bar staff were very friendly and helpful with suggestions, the drinks were good and the atmosphere was cozy and comfortable.

The hotel is undergoing refurbishment which did not disturb me at all during the stay. I was given a newly refurbished room, on the top floor, overlooking the lake. The room was very clean and had a big desk and chair, a storage chest as well as a wardrobe and also a sofa and coffee table. The bed was extremely comfortable (brand new) and I also appreciated the complimentary TV guide in the room (useful for when watching TV during the night - thanks to the jetlag!). The bathroom was small but again new and clean with a bath and shower attachment with good water pressure and a WC. The washbasin was actually outside the bathroom in a small vanity unit opposite the wardrobe (the dressing area as I referred to it!) and also had a coffee making machine. Room cleaning was thorough and items I sent to be laundered were returned promptly and neatly pressed. There is also a laundry room on the first floor of the hotel with wachine machine and tumble dryer facilities. The hotel has an adequate (if a little sweaty) gym on the 1st floor and also a swimming pool and jacuzzi on the ground floor. I found time to try out the gym but unfortunately not the pool! The hotel has a restaurant which is open for breakfast - a good buffet selection (hot food and waffles as well as a cold selection), and then serves room service/bar menu in the evenings. I ordered room service one night and the food was adequate although a little cold, and we had food in the bar one night which was fine although nothing special. The bar is dark but comfortable and has an adjoining sofa area next to a fire which is very nice. All staff I encountered were friendly and polite, especially Michael on reception who ensured that my colleague and I received the nicest rooms possible after our long journey. There is a small shop next to reception selling souvenirs, sweets, crisps, drinks, paper and books. Free coffee (starbucks) is also available with paper cups in reception every morning, and cookies in reception in the evenings (very soft, chewy and yummy!) The hotel also offers a free shuttle service to 5 locations in Seattle which is fantastic! Space Needle is a 20 minute walk away but I would recommend a taxi or the shuttle as it is not an easy walk and involves crossing madly busy highways!! The only downsides would be (in my opinion) the location in terms of what's around - there wasn't an obvious supermarket or store nearby and although there were a number of restaurants within walking distance they were on the whole more pricey - so a diner or deli would have been perfect - obviously this is not the fault of the hotel! The hotel is a pleasant 30 minute walk from Fremont which is a lovely quaint area full of nice shops and restaurants - I particularly recommend PCC wholefoods which has a fab selection of hot and cold foods as well as groceries and drinks, and baja fresh for fresh,, healthy mexican foods. For teas and coffees, Peet's would be my recommendation! I would certainly stay here again and would recommend this hotel as a mid-range hotel suitable for families or business travellers.", "Date": "March 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBed was disappointing\u201d", "Author": "terrilee", "ReviewID": "UR2155623", "Content": "The hotel was attractive and the staff was professional and friendly when I was there.
