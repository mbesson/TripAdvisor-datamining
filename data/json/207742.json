We were moved to a beautiful 5th floor suite with at least 1 balcony in every room, and a beautiful view over the opera. Ms. Jonsdottir came and introduced herself as we sat in the club, and reiterated that she was at our disposal for the length of our stay. The club staff went out of their way to make sure that we had whatever we needed or wanted to be comfortable. Ms Ensuque has an amazing team in Gilles, Stephan, and Jessica. Yes, there are more expensive places to stay in Paris, and there are the fancy hotels in which one has to be seen: think Park Hyatt and the new W.

We normally stay on the other side of the city so we tried staying around this area for a change. The real plus side of this hotel is the location. It is beside all the shops, really good access to the attractions with the Metro station right outside the door, and the eateries and restaurants in the area are plentiful. We had an executive room which was spacious and clean. It had a very good view of the Opera which was nice. The decor was really good with all the usual features including minibar, flatscreen TV, separate shower & bath, nice toiletries. The lobby was impressive and the service at the desk was good. The downside was the price of the extras. Minibar prices are crazy. Broadband prices the same and the film prices on the TV were \u20ac35. I cannot understand why prices have to be so high. The local shops in the area must make a fortune from guests buying water and wine and bringing it to the room with them. It is cheaper for me to rent a movie at home (Ireland), bring it with me to France and pay extra charges for late returns than pay for one movie on the TV. Also, why do you have to charge for broadband. Can you not swallow the costs in the price of the room ? At \u20ac276 per night, surely this is not that hard. I really believe that if the prices for minibars, Films and broadband were reasonable you would sell a lot more. We ate in the restaurant on one of the nights and it was only OK.

There was a sort of entry foyer which separated the bathroom from the bedroom. The bathroom was great. It also had a balcony! We did recieve the ambassador amenities (chocolates, bottled water). The gym is also excellent! Plus, you can pick up a couple bottles of juice, and a piece of fruit on your way out. Location is GREAT! At the Opera, Metro stop right there, easy walking. There are a couple cons... The wallpaper was peeling in multiple places in our room, a couple light bulbs out in the hall (not a big deal since we were staying on points, BUT if I was paying the going rate of almost 500 Euros per night, that would be unacceptable). There is NO internet anywhere for free. The service in the lobby bar was not very attentive.

As we were Intercontinental club members (and enjoyed an incredible experience of quality and service at the Intercontinental in Hong Kong recently) we decided to choose this hotel. When we arrived a rather curt assistant told us that as we were members we would be upgraded to another room. We asked if it had a view of the Eiffel Tower and she said no. We had requested this 4 months earlier and told her that on NYE we wanted a great view of fireworks etc. She said that it was compulsory to have an upgrade as a club member so she HAD to upgrade us and no upgraded room had a view! After a lot of discussion and distress she agreed to give us a room with a view. We should have just taken the upgrade!!! The room was dated and shabby and if you climbed out of the window and stood on the ledge they call a balcony and craned your neck around the corner, you could just make out the top of the Eiffel Tower in the distance - that is if there were no clouds. The two nights we spent at the hotel were so depressing that we decided to leave or hate our stay in Paris. The reasons were as follows: - the hotel is so enormous that you walk around for ages before you find what you're looking for (no personal service). - because the hotel is so big, the staff are overworked and cranky or maybe just normally Paris cranky. - after charging exorbitant prices for the room, they have the audacity to charge extra for EVERYTHING! They need to realise that these days everyone includes free internet, even the cheapest of hotels. For 2 nights my internet fee was over 50 euros! - the location of the hotel is not great (only if you're going to the Opera). We wanted a nightlife (zero) and small streets with interesting cafes etc. Nothing like that here. Just big city noise and loads of traffic. - the concierge staff did not notice us when we arrived and left so we had to carry our suitcases up the stairs (cant believe there are stairs at the entrance!). Noone was there to open the grand doors at the entrance. Very bad first impression. Oh by the way, there were no fireworks over the Eiffel Tower. We didn't know that but it would have been nice for the person checking us in to let us know. And finally, we came away with a few bits on our legs and thought we'd been bitten on our walk somewhere.

It was my birthday, so the young woman at the front desk upgraded my room, and the staff sent up an absolutely delicious chocolate cake and a handwritten card in impeccable English. I really appreciated the gesture. The hotel does a turndown service and the bathroom amenities are L'Occitane. The location is perfect for anyone coming to see the Paris Opera - and the Roissybus stops a block down the street. Minor Cons: The hotel is huge. I wound up getting lost trying to exit once or twice. Internet costs a small fortune, as do most other incidentals. The Opera view rooms may have a view, but there is also a great deal of street noise. One afternoon an oompah band awoke me from a nap. I had to laugh.

The bed was definitely not a queen - somewhere between a full and a queen and there was a small writing desk and chair but not room for much else. Although the room was clean and comfortable it just wasn't what I was expecting for having paid what we did, I also felt the bathrooms were a bit run down and could use updating. Also the hotel is massive in size and you definitely get the \"convention\" type of feeling - ie not much personal attention paid. We were first given a room with an interior view but they corrected this quickly after calling down to bring this to their attention. The concierge was not very helpful - sent us to a restaurant that was closed for the evening, however the rest of the service staff were kind and very helpful and attentive to our needs. The bar was a nice place to spend our time and was very comfortable and the adjoining restaurant Cafe de la Paix is top notch. Understanding that luxury accomodations in Paris are on a different level, I can understand why this isn't a five star hotel - next trip to Paris I will most likely pay more per night to find a place with a 5 star rating and that is more comfortable, and my advice is that I think it would be worth it to look beyond the Le Grand for those who can afford too.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best hotels ever\u201d", "Author": "LHRNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR122605423", "Content": "I stayed at the InterContinental Paris with my sister last November.

Well it won\u2019t and I will keep bugging them until the correct action is taken. I would like to share my experience at this hotel. after staying 2 out of the 6 nights, my guests mentioned the next morning he had gotten bite during the night but his wife dismissed it as don\u2019t be silly and we all moved on. Then after the 4th night ,I woke in the morning to find I also had bite marks on my arm from which I dismissed also, but on awakening after the 5th night I had a bigger problem. There now was many bites on my body, now I knew it was bed bugs and this was confirmed when I pulled back the white bed sheets to find were little spots of blood on the sheets. I immediately called the duty manager who quickly summoned the housekeeper to visit my room. This is where it all started to go wrong. The housekeeper with an assistant proceeded to tear the bed apart in front of my wife who was already horrified at the thought of what she saw on my body. So after searching for 10 minutes the housekeeper informed me that there are no bugs in the bed as we have a pest control company that visit regularly , the name was ready pest or Rentokil, I never quite heard her. So I showed the housekeeper the bites on my arm and she immediately informed me these are not bug bites? How she came to that conclusion so quickly baffled me as I am pretty sure she has not had the medical training that a professional doctor spent years learning. Next the duty manager called to say we are moving room, an upgrade from our junior suite to the first floor presidential suite. A nice gesture under the circumstances, there was also thrown in a bottle of house champagne, fruit and water for our troubles. Now I go to reception to talk with duty manager about a dinner booking later that evening and she proceeds to tell me all about how they have never had a case of bed bugs in 4 year and asks to look at my arm. I showed her my arm but said I am not going to show you the rest of my body. Her eye rolling response after seeing my arm, told me she was in doubt of my situation. Now she has peaked an anger in me. I also informed her about my guest experience the previous nights(room 3230) to which she just looked at me and said ..... impossible. Well my guests and wife are close by so I thanked her and joined my party to attend our dinner plans. But inside I am fuming about my honesty being questioned and I would go as far to say that she even hinted about my motive to which I replied, if I had a motive to deceive you It would have made sense to do it on my 1st night stay and not my last night. Then she informs me that the hotel will have to destroy everything in that room. that may well be, but if it is the only way to get rid of bed bugs than that is what needs to be done. This is not my concern. i do believe she is not willing to admit the fact or is in denial that her hotel has bed bugs. 2 rooms with bed bugs floors apart.

I even tried a Japanese whiskey, which I had never had (tasty). The restaurant, Cafe de la Paix is very elegant with the gold-leaf and decorated ceilings. We had breakfast there every morning with a big buffet with American-style breakfast, eggs, bacon, sausage and the most delicious roasted potatoes and roasted tomatoes, and of course, the wonderful French pastries and breads. The cost of our breakfast was included in the room package, but off the street, it would be pricey. We ate one dinner in the hotel, and it was superb. The lamb was prepared as I have never had it and was delicious. We also had a nice pinot noir, Bouchard Pere & Fils Premier Cru Pommard which I highly recommend. Our room was on the third floor with a view of the Opera which I recommend. The only minor distraction was the sound of the metro trains which sounded like distant thunder, so not really too objectionable. The room was well appointed with a comfortable bed and plush coverings. The bathroom was modern and nicely done with granite counters and a tub and separate shower. I would have liked free wi-fi for my ipad, but apparently that's not common in the nicer hotels these days even in the US. There's lots of shopping nearby with the Galleries Lafayette and the really posh Place Vendome. Rue Cambon is an easy walk as is Tuleries and Place de la Concorde.

This is a bargain as the club served a wonderful breakfast, drinks and snacks throughout the day, and an open bar again with dinner canapes and sweets. Every person we came into contact with at this hotel was gracious and could not do enough to make us feel welcome. From the restaurant staff at Cafe de la Paix, to the doorman, to the housekeepers, they ALL went the extra mile. The club staff was especially professional and kind--- Anna & Lavrene and 2 other ladies whose names I did not get. This is indirect contrast to the Park Hyatt Vendome where we stayed 2 nights (also using points) before moving to the Intercontinental: they were snotty, cold and the staff was very condescending. My husband, a Hyatt diamond member, even said that he would never go back to that hotel. So Intercontinental, Paris you have us for life.

Its location was excellent for sightseeing, shopping and dining, which is what we did during our visit to Paris. Although the hotel is impressive, the rooms are clean and the bathrooms are modern, we were expecting better service in general and for Ambassador Gold members in particular. We had a reservation for a Superior room (one or two levels above the classic room) with breakfast included in the rate. Check-in was slow as many people were checking in the afternoon we arrived. We were expecting a guaranteed upgrade as Ambassador Gold members, but we believe we still got a Superior room, which is what we had booked. The room size suited us and we made no fuss about it. However the room was extremely warm (it felt as if it were almost 30 C) and we cranked up the airconditioning to make it cooler. After a while, we realised that it had not cooled off one little bit and called for someone to look into he matter. It was a beautiful evening and we decided to go out and stroll while we waited for he room to get cooler. When we got back an hour and a half later we had a message asking how the room was after the repair of the airconditioner. However, the room was still warm and we called again. Reluctant to give us another room, service was called again. Maintenance came and told us that, indeed, the aircondiotining was not cooling off enough. They said that they would crank it up by manually setting the maximum cooling temperature and fan speed. It did nothing for us. We called again and they were going to send maintenance personnel once again. At that time, we felt that the system was beyond providing us with a cooler temperature and we asked for a room change. There was quite a lot of hesitation but we insisted as we had valid health reasons not to stay in the warm room. And even so, we still felt susbtantial unwillingness to change our room. We were finally offered a choice of 2 rooms (both were somewhat inferior to our first room, either in terms of layout or bathroom size) We took the one that felt cooler in temperature. The bathroom would have benefitted from an exhaust fan and a better sealing glass enclosure (European half length). Service provided by other personnel and concierges was excellent. Breakfast was plentiful and excellent and great to have included in the room rate as it would have been extremely expensive otherwise.

Check-in was efficient and friendly and I got an upgrade. I asked for any other perks as I am a Platinum priority club member and Ambassador, but apart from a free newspaper there was nothing else.... I stayed here using my reward points. The room was spacious but had a bit of an muggy smell. The furniture and interior could use some refurbishment. The TV was very small and didn\u2019t function properly also difficult angle to see the screen from the bed. Internet expensive at 24 EUR per 24h.

Now I can imagine that if I was paparazzi and take photos of people, it may be a problem, but I was pointing my camera at the ceiling! I really did not like the rude attitude of the man, who didn\u2019t ask me I was a guest nor explained to me why I couldn't make any photos. Location of the hotel is very central, but in my opinion there are more interesting areas to stay in Paris with more interesting restaurants and shops in the area. There are a lot of tourist traps around this hotel. I didn't have breakfast here as I find 37 Euro for continental breakfast simply ridiculous. There are many other places around for breakfast. Like a beautiful Starbucks nearby at the Av de Opera situated in an old converted Opera House. Good for a quick coffee and croissant for an ok price with the same feel as were you sitting in the lobby or \"Cafe de la Paix\" of the Intercontinental. Conclusion: I stayed here using my reward points and was thinking I would really feel ripped off If I had to pay the full price (rooms starting at 325 EUR for Standard up to ..... lots).

I really wanted to write a good review. But if you go to Paris on business, this hotel is not set up for use of the Internet/WWW. Amazing to write that last sentence in 2011. On my stay, I tried to use my laptop in the room: the connection Network/Cat 5 cord had the tab broken -- but I pushed it in and got some life but never the Internet. I called the front desk and a \"techie\" showed up who couldn't solve the problem. It was 1am and I was beat. I asked about wireless -- but I couldn't get a signal in my room. I went down to the concierge desk and asked to use the Business Center. He told me it was closed. I asked him to open it for five minutes -- no dice. I said: \"Do I have to walk back to my firm's office in Paris to get an internet connection.\" He said: \"Yes.\" Which I did. Not happy. (My laptop worked like a charm in the office.) In the morning, I learned that virtually none of the rooms have working wireless connections, but that the wireless only works at this hotel in the common areas (like the Front Lobby and the staircases). Odd. Why didn't concierge tell me?? After I heard this, I noticed that there was a ghetto of guests who sit on staircases or in the lobby trying to use the wireless internet. This hotel does not care about them. Very odd for an Intercontinental in the year 2011. My next hotel was the Hotel Amigo in Brussels -- I was in a hurry to boot up and the only thing the butler who showed me to the room said was: Here's the internet connection -- and pointed to a very nice card which walked me through the connection. Up and running in 30 seconds, the way a business traveler expects.

The majority of the guests in the Hotel seemed to be American, and I am sure thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. It is extremely comfortable, particularly the beds, and the environment in the hotel is plush. However, the hotel has some big failings, especially when you consider the price I paid for a room for one night, which was EUR500. When travelling on business, I want to get in and out quickly, so the extremely slow and surly reception staff were an immediate put-off. Completely disinterested in my custom, I felt I had to apologise to one member of check-in staff for inconviencing her for asking to checkout. Additionally, why the check-in staff could not ask me if I wanted wireless access when I arrived is beyond me. I had to go back down to reception to get a wireless key once in my room. Finally, how a hotel can charge EUR24 for 24 hours internet access is beyond me, especially when paying EUR500 a night. Also, my other complaint was the pitiful shower in my room. Terrible.

Small, but oh that view. Reception desk was friendly on all occasions. One even personally delivered keys to our other room when it later became available. Best of all, as an IC Amb, I received welcome amenities of boxed mini Madeleines as well as Fauchon mini petite beurre on top of glass-bottled Evian. Got freshly-baked cookies as welcome amenity in the other room as well. Another benefit of being an IC Amb is that they will offer to extend check-out until 4pm at the time of check-in. The only complaint I can recall is that the A/C wasn't working properly so I just turned it off. Hopefully they get all the units fixed before the onset of summer. Didn't make use of all the hotel features and amenities due to our brief stay and constantly being out on the town, but found the overall service level courteous and friendly despite the hotel being very full.

Once you close the window, the room is very quiet. Great sound insulation for people who are sensitive to noise. The average: Even with the recent renovation, the room feels used and tired. The TV looks like it's 25 inches in size and it's way too small for a room of this size and price. It's also very old with poor video and sound quality. With the window open, you can not hear what's being played. And like the other reviewers stated, the AC did not work. We called the service and supposedly it was fixed. They did call to follow up but the fix did not work. The good thing was that the outside temp was very nice and we just left the windows open and it was fine.

But this hotel very wisely has an \"Attachee Relation Clientele\" (a guest relation specialist) that you can immediately talk too if you are having any kind of problem. Within 15 minutes of us complaining about the room, the guest relation specialist on duty, Lena Ensuques-Hemissi, resolved our problem to our complete satisfaction. Our new room had high molded ceilings, large windows, a beautiful bathroom, complimentary champagne and yes...two small closets. We stayed 6 days here and found that all the hotel staff that we encountered were very polite and willing to go out of their way to help us. For example, the Concierge called five different restaurants to find out who had \"beef bourguignon\" on the menu (when all we asked is what restaurant may have this dish on the menu).

I knew it was a very busy period for the hotels in Opera/Vendome area and as I expected the hotel was fully booked. In fact we had to be transferred to another hotel nearby. This is normally not a good start of a hotel stay but it was dealt with very professionally. First of all we were treated with drink in the beautiful main bar while they found us another hotel. Then the customer service manager Linda arranged the transport etc to the new hotel and was very apologetic. As a tourist I really didn\u2019t mind changing hotel \u2013 it gave me opportunity to see more area of Paris. The whole process of finding replacement to check in at the other hotel was smooth and fantastic. The next day we went back to hotel pretty early knowing that the rooms wouldn\u2019t be ready anyway. The receptionist was very kind to have taken down my mobile phone number and called me when the rooms were cleaned and ready for check in. Everyone here spoke perfect English. Rooms: We had two rooms \u2013 one Executive and one deluxe, both on the 5th floor. The Executive room was decorated in red and faced the Opera House. The view was just fantastic. The Deluxe room had no view but the room was well appointed with a very tasteful decoration. Sometimes you can hear the metro and feel the vibration but it stopped after midnight so it didn\u2019t bother me. The sound insulation was good as well. The bathrooms in both rooms were similar size, with L\u2019occitine amenities and Frette robe/towels which were much appreciated. Bed was comfortable. On Easter Sunday we received some Easter Eggs. Good touch especially in such a big hotel. Air-condition in both room worked extremely well which was essential due to hot weather. If I have to be very critical about the rooms, I would say that there should be free wifi nowadays and the TV system isn\u2019t the best in the world. The water screen in the bathtub was also not great \u2013 water came off on the floor after shower. Concierge Concierge team did a great job. We didn\u2019t know if most places would be closed during Easter weekend so had to rely on Concierge. They were hard working and very humorous. Food and Beverage: I know the price in Paris is very high and people complain about the price in the hotel. I didn\u2019t have an opportunity to try the restaurant but was told by locals that it was a very good option. Coffee in the main lounge costs EUR8 which sounds very high but I also tried some other hotels in the same area as well as some local bar.

The corridors are luxe with fine appointments throughout. Check-in was warm and solicitous, and my thanks to Jenny at the front desk for making it so. The concierge sported a set of double-keys, indicative of his superior training and he helped organize our outing to Versailles. This is a place for a splurge and we had one of the best rooms in the hotel. Two french doors opened onto a balcony facing the Opera Garnier. Quite an compelling view particularly as the night we were there the French President was attending an event for graduating military. The washroom was spacious and included a separate shower and a tub. The shower head was one of the best and was a real luxury after a week of roughing it elsewhere (a small apartment that we occasionally rent). I know some rooms face into an inner courtyard, which is probably not an experience I would want; since that was not my experience though, I have nothing to add except that you should keep in mind that the hotel was three basic sides - and facing the Courtyard may not provide the most fabulous of views. The king size bed was very comfortable. A separate chair for lounging. A writing table with a separate chair. The wall was covering with fabric wallpaper. Close to the major stores - place de la Madelaine, Printemps, Galeries Lafayette. It's a great central right bank location if you're looking for an upscale experience. I'm more of a Marais type, and this was a splurge. We had a wonderful stay.

And you pay more for the privilege! When we first arrived, the opulence and grandeur of the entrance and lobby (not to mention the high rates) set us up to believe that we were about to experience a truly luxurious stay. However, scratch beneath the surface and only disappointment awaits. We booked a night there for my wife's birthday at the tail end of a business trip - it was the fourth hotel between us that week - and had booked a room with an Opera view which is supposedly the highest category of room apart from the suites - so better than superior and classic etc... We were paying over 400 euros. The view of the Opera was beautiful and the room itself was spacious, very elegant, luxurious looking and beautiful. So at first we were very impressed. It turned out though that the bathroom was literally the size of a closet. We asked reception if there was a room with a larger bathroom but after initially suggesting we pay more to upgrade to a suite and later insisting that the hotel was full, we got the truth that there were rooms with better bathrooms but they were reserved for VIPs. OK, so we decided to live with it, no big deal in the end. Really it was the disturbing vibrations of the Metro that really ruined our stay in the end. The hotel should warn people who book on the Opera side of this, when we complained the staff freely admitted that this was an issue. How the hotel can charge extra for these rooms is incredible. What is the point of a great view if it feels as if there are minor earthquakes going off every ten minutes. The final disappointment was the quality of food from room service - edible but truly disappointing given the prices. Overall, the staff were very polite but frankly I felt that the hotel is so big and so busy that they have no real reason to be helpful, they gain nothing from it, which is a shame because so many people had told me the hotel is good and I had stayed there almost ten years previously and remembered it to be good.

To give you an example, my partner 'Le Terrible' was able to correspond with the famous and exemplary General Director Christophe Laure to ask for some aid in our following booking. M. Laure not only helped us with our situation but he went above and beyond and we look forward to meeting him in February. This is the type of service I write about. Imagine!

Wifi, A/C, Cable TV and a nice size room for any hotel of this level in Paris, especially in the 'middle category' of room prices. The main lobby is a place I could sit with a wonderful glass of Bollinger or Krug for hours. The ambiance is Grand Paris at its best. The tea service that is offered in the open in the raised salon area is a special treat and makes for a real lovely experience and mind you..you might be to full to dine at dinner..so perhaps the tea service and a light dinner in the famous 'Cafe de la Paix' that is a Paris institution and the main restaurant of the hotel. This report is from my trip in October but really covers the 3 visits since 2009. I will give an update after our February visit.

I purchased their Ambassador status in advance to get an automatic room upgrade. It is possible my experience was a result of this status. For $200 you can purchase Ambassador Status, and the automatic upgrade makes it well worth it (not to mention a free movie each stay and free weekend night stay). First, the hotel is located near the Opera right where the RoissyBus runs from CDG so transport to the hotel was great. The location put you two blocks from the main department stores in Paris. In addition, the Opera metro station was a block away to take us everywhere else we wanted to go. We arrived around 9:30 Sunday morning and were checked in to our room immediately. We had a superior room and were given a city view with a view of Eiffel! I expected the room to be very small, but that was not the case. The hallway had a tall shelf/drawer \"armoire\" built in, the doorway to the bathroom, and a built-in closet. The bathroom was what I would expect in the US (bathtub/shower, vanity with sink, etc.). The room had a queen bed with desk, easy chair, cabinet with a refrigerator (with room for personal items and not just the mini bar) and TV. Plenty of room to get around, and it had a small balcony to enjoy the view from. Decor included art reprints from painters such as Degas and Manet, and the furniture and trimmings had an old-world feel. There were only a few cons to this hotel: 1. They wanted 8 Euro per hour or 24 Euro per day for internet which is outrageous. They seemed to have moved the business center to the Executive Level which will run you about 150 Euro per night for two people so that wasn't really available either. 2. When we asked room service for a dinner setting to eat some food we brought back they wanted 10 Euro. We avoided paying this by just calling the front desk and they sent it up for nothing. 3. The down pillows were not very comfortable, and getting the non-allergenic ones were not much better. 4. We avoided Cafe de La Paix do to the unappetizing menu and poor Tripadvisor user reviews. 5. I used a combination of points and cash to book my stay so paying for the entire trip could be expensive, but I think it would still be well worth it.

Personally, I think Paris is a city in which it is essential to stay opulently; it is such a grand, ornate place that the idea of retreating to a hovel in some god-knows-where arrondissement, no matter how much one saves, is mind-bendingly depressing. Le Grand Hotel, a fine old lady of sophistication that offers enough of the gilt and presence of the city\u2019s \u2018grand dames\u2019, is perfect for those who consider The Ritz, George V and Crillon just a little bit \u2018too much.\u2019 We stayed in a deluxe room for a three day weekend including Valentine\u2019s Day and extracted excellent value from the hotel\u2019s location, first-rate concierge and comfortable bedding. I don\u2019t normally like Intercontinentals, mostly because they are characterless blocks of concrete, but they occupy a wonderful spot in the City of Light. The heyday of Le Grand may well be over, when Chaplin, Churchill et al were in town, but it has as much history as any of the Parisian \u2018palace\u2019 hotels; L\u2019Hotel might be where Oscar Wilde perished, but it was Le Grand where he wanted to be. Parts of the hotel have acquired a corporate dullness that is distinctly un-Parisian, but it seems that the recent renovation has been directed to eradicate this. Rooms have been wisely redecorated in Second Empire style and the lobby feels as luxurious as many of the more expensive rendez-vous in the city. We never ate breakfast at the hotel (what\u2019s the point when you are in Paris?), nor did we eat dinner at the vaunted Caf\u00e9 de la Paix. There\u2019s just too much to do in Paris to hang around the same spot all day. What the hotel did provide was an extraordinarily convenient base from which to explore the best sites in Paris. The location is fabulous; on the Place de l\u2019Opera, very close to the Place Madeleine, Place Vendome and Place de la Concorde and within easy walking distance of the Tuileries, this is the best value hotel in the area \u2013 Le Meurice is in a more prized location but is also legendarily expensive. I also prefer this side of Paris to the chi-chi Champs Elysees/Avenue Montaigne district because, apart from the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe, most of the action is down this end of town. Le Grand offers old world elegance with a very high standard of service for a price that won\u2019t even buy a massage in the Plaza Athenee.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced\u201d", "Author": "Homesick_Alien", "ReviewID": "UR93326351", "Content": "I came here with a colleague on a business trip in November having hear great things about this luxury hotel.

Of personal taste, I didnt find my Opera facing room to be anything special (room itself and the view) and actually disliked it because of the audible street noise that begins at around 8 am and doesnt stop til around 10 pm - car honking, motor cycles, tourists and occasional street performers on steps of Opera. My most substantial, fact based gripes are twofold: 1) Gym is tiny and except for 3 or 4 treadmills and 1 or 2 elliptical machines, it has a paltry single cable resistance machine. A large, professional gym with a lot of machines is an important criterion for me and this hotel is sub par regarding that. 2). In room internet charge is expensive especially when factoring in the high room rate. I dont know how this compares to other luxury hotels but in absolute terms, its expensive- roughly 30 Euros a night. As for service, I didnt use use room service or need much interaction from the front desk staff. But there seems to be an undercurrent of slight rudeness to indifference by the front desk staff and ground floor employees (eg, the porters who set up the restaurant tables). I'm not a particularly friendly person myself who requires effusiveness from others, but the aformentioned staff seemed to either be slightly rude (no hello when you pass right by them) to having that forced, affected politness.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, Excellent location\u201d", "Author": "alwaysenjoyinglife1", "ReviewID": "UR83367833", "Content": "Pros: 1.

We were greeted very warmly by front desk and upon entering our rather spacious room, we had waiting for us a fruit platter, chocolates, lovely champagne and a warm welcoming card hand signed from guest relations.

We have been to Paris before, but were spared all the jet-lagged airport-to-town train and Metro connections by using the Roissybus, which we caught right outside baggage claim and dropped us, 45 minutes later, within view of the hotel.

We foolishly had an \"American breakfast\" at a cafe around the corner from the hotel and opposite the Opera one morning that ended up being the most expensive meal of our trip. Prices weren't posted and they did not provide us a menu - so beware. We saw others, fresh off the bus, doing the same thing. Our best, and most reasonable American breakfast was actually at a cafe close to the entrance to the Louvre, where prices were prominently posted, and for a quick croissant and pot of tea, we breakfasted at a bakery at the bottom of the steps inside the Metro. Although we had been to Paris before, we hadn't ever toured the Opera itself. The timing is difficult if you are staying in this hotel because the Opera building doesn't open for fourts until around 10 and it closes doors for entry at about 4, and we were usually gone earlier and back later, but the day we worked it out, it was worth the effort.

Hi, Before I riddle the hotel; one thing we want to say is that we loved Paris and will be back there again - loved the place, the food and the wine. back to the hotel review: We have a lot of French and Parisian (in specific) friends in HK. I must say that when we arrived at the Le Grand in Paris, most of our friends had said that we would be very pleased with our choice. Sadly, we had only complaints to take back. 1. The amount of time it takes to process anything: A. When we arrived at the hotel with our baggage, no one came to help us for 5 minutes. We had to ASK someone to help us. Seriously! B. At the time of check in, it took them 20 minutes to check us in. When we fly to and live in NY, Sg or Bombay or Maldives or anywhere else, even if its a crowded time, we have never stayed more than 10 minutes at the Reception. C. That was the beginning of the \"waits we had to face at your hotel\" - We were told we had access to The Club on the 5th floor and access to the buffet. Now if we have been given access to The Club, the reception at The Club should know of it; he made us wait 5 minutes. I can understand if it happens the first time; but this happened on 2 more occasions and what's worst is that all 3 times it was the same gentleman who was receiving us. On the 3rd occasion, we told him to forget it and went out and had breakfast. D. You have a button on your phones in the rooms labeled \"Reach Us Anytime\" or something to that effect. Even during normal hours like 9-11 am; it would take about 10 minutes for any one to respond with simple requests like whats the charge for the internet or can we have some scissors? 2. Rudeness of your staff A. At Cafe La Paix (I hope I got it right), there is a lady (tall and wears glasses, she wears glasses), ok I think we have never seen a person more rude EVER. And its not just who faced her ire, there were at least 3-4 occasions we heard some other guests of your hotel saying, \"please speak politely\". Even when we would come to the Cafe for breakfast @ 8am, she would make us wait for 2 minutes and invariably always give us the seats outside when we clearly said we want it inside. The second time she did I told her we are sitting inside and I saw her mouth \"tokya\" I know I am not French, but I have enough French friends to know what abuse that refers to B. While checking out: When we were checking out, it was laughable. Your team not only know how to communicate with guests, I dont think they communicate among themselves: At the time of checking in (which took 20 minutes as mentioned above); we were assured that breakfast buffet is included. I never check bills from hotels; but this time my wife just asked for it and thankfully she did: even after promising a buffet included there was a Euro 450 charge for breakfast! And then instead of apologizing for the mistake or lack of communication among your own team members, your staff had the audacity to say \"You made a mistake!\". Now I know English is a tough language, but seriously not this tough, is it! The only helpful people were at the Concierge. Very nice and helpful people. Like I said, we loved Paris and the biggest thing was that we never had anything to be happy about while staying with Intercontinental. Usually we stay at the 4 Seasons and I think we have been right on our decisions. You really need to tell your staff at this hotel what service is all about. I am putting this review on tripadvisor.com and you can be rest assured all my friends will know about this experience of mine.

Traveled to Paris this time with my 17 year old daughter, to visit my oldest daughter who was there for her study abroad term. Also, this time wanted to stay away from all the touristy stops, and really walk the neighborhoods of Paris. We also were there to do some shopping during 'soldes' time. The Le Grand is a lovely hotel. Being a ambassador member I found that my room was upgraded to a junior suite. A wonderful room, and a true 'junior suite', not a European junior suite. It has a sitting room area, bed area, desk area, large bathroom and a walk in closet. Only thing I would say, it that the closet needs a ton more lighting. The room was immaculate and comfortable. The bathroom walls could use a tiny bit of fixing up., as there was a tiny bit of peeling paint, obviously due to the humidity that gathers in the room. TV is not great, only two English speaking channels. I cannot understand with the availability of services why hotels in Europe still cannot provide better English speaking options for TV. Opted for the breakfast at the hotel one morning at $38euro-p/p. It was a nice change, pretty extensive in items offered (hot and cold). If you love breakfast, the price isn't all that bad, myself I am not a huge breakfast person so I am not sure I really ate $50+ worth of breakfast.

One of the great hotels of Europe - well-situated, huge, luxurious, elegant, calm, quiet , the list goes on. Our only ongoing objection: the strangely insistent music in the glorious central lounge, where, as always, we would much prefer that silence reigned! Rather than simply repeat the obvious, then, it is perhaps worth underlining one of the ways in which, while times are hard, you can enjoy this superb hotel at much less than the official and frankly daunting rack rates. We recently spent a couple of nights at the hotel on my Intercontinental Hotels Ambassador membership, which for 150 dollars a year guarantees an upgrade, a free weekend night a year, late check-out, and fresh fruit and mineral water at any ICH hotel. On this occasion, a room booked at 390 Euros per night was accordingly upgraded on arrival to one with a wonderful view down over the Opera House, the rack rate for which turned out to be 820 Euros per night. The first night was payable, the second I took as my annual free night. The 'Business Plus' package on which this was booked also included free access to the Club Room, which appears to have a separate (and in our opinion excessive) charge of 150 Euros per day. The whole deal, in other words, only cost a total of just 390 Euros for two nights - for a room which would have totalled 1640 at rack rate, plus the Club Room extras. (Oh, and because of a mix-up over names, we accidentally received no fewer than three welcome gifts from the Manager.) This is, self-evidently, not only an extraordinary bargain when set against the rack rate but moreover well below the typical charge at many inferior hotels. If you can't find a 'Business Plus' deal on Intercontinental's own site, by the way, check out the 'Virtuoso' category at www.classictravel.com.

The only downside to this hotel was the price of breakfast, in room bar etc, 9 euro for a can of coke and 45 euro for breakfast, so be prepared to eat out if you are not willing to pay these prices.

For example, some minor mold in the shower, peeling paint/wallpaper, exterior room balcony & doors that needed painting badly, new toilet seat needed (!), and a frumpy coach in a junior suite that goes for 1,300 Euro per night (although I only paid 400 Euro for it). Club lounge was nice, but service cutbacks evident - tables VERY slow to be cleared (I'm talking hours!), same menu selection 4 days in a row, with only the basics when it came to food. Service was helter skelter. It was tasty the first night, but by day 3 of 4, it was old. Madrid and London Club lounges in comparison are much better overall. Upon check-in, was given a room that when I walked in, was not serviced yet and completely a wreck with used sheets and towels all over the floor. I am an Ambassador member and stay, when I can, almost exclusively at Intercontinentals - so I know when things need to be improved - and management better get a hold of these situations fast else risk a 3.5 star property. Now all that said, the positives are the Location (close/walkable to most sights and across the street from the non-stop bus to/from the airport), the sheer grandeur of the property (the lobby bar and restaurant are both excellent with among the best people-watching one can find), and also close to lots and lots of shopping and restaurant choices. For these reasons - and provided there is no further decline in the room shabbiness or service levels - this hotel still gets my recommendation. A word about Paris - it's a truly magical place, but a VERY VERY expensive one. For example - 7-8 Euro for a beeer in a local (non-touristy) cafe, 38 Euro each! for breakfast in the hotel restaurant, a glass of the cheapest champagne in the lobby bar is 19 Euro (beer is 12). And the traffic/exhaust pollution is perhaps the worst I've experienced outside of Saigon. I was really surprised - central Paris needs to get a handle on this or risk being on the decline amongst other European grand capitals. And while smoking is not permitted anywhere indoors, the number of smokers outside far exceeds non-smokers at any given time. I was shocked at how many people (especially the younger folks) are puff, puff, puffing away. Tragic. Forget sitting at an outside cafe unless you want to breath the smoke of others pretty non-stop. Go inside for a more pleasant experience, albeit without a view. That really disappointed me. If you have any sort of sinus problem or are prone to coughing due to outside irritants - you WILL be affected. I know this all sounds pretty negative, but in the end, we had an absolutely great time despite the disappointments noted above.

Quite strange to think we stayed two nights in Leeds in the UK and qualified for a night here! We had already stayed at another hotel in Paris so one night was just fine with us. What an amazing hotel. It really does leave you quite open mouthed on arrival. It is certainly Grand and from the moment you set foot in any part of the hotel you are immediately taken care of. The foyer was magnificent, rather like a gracious ocean liner and full of beautiful orchids. Check in was both quick, friendly and efficient. The centre of the hotel which has an amazing glass roof is where you can take afternoon tea or a pre dinner drink (if you can afford it). Even the lifts are pretty incredible with the dark wood, marble floors and brass fittings. Given our room was going to be free we were not expecting much but it was vast. A massive and incredibly comfortable bed dominated the room which also had a chaise longue. The bathroom was also enormous with bath and separate shower and toilet - all very clean and with some lovely L'Occitane toiletries. We didn't hear anybody next door to us or above us - if there were any guests in those rooms. The only downsides to the hotel were the prices charged for ... well...almost anything! We would not have dreamt of buying anything in the hotel at all - to charge 9 euros for a cup of coffee is extortionate but of course if you actually pay for a bedroom then 9 euros is nothing! The menu for food and drink was eye popping for prices generally. Also no free internet which quite frankly is a bit tight given the prices of the rooms. Strangely British television channels amount ed to two - BBC and BBC World - although ITV was advertised it was actually the BBC again. We were on the second floor so the noise from the traffic was quite loud (lorries tended to rattle the furniture) but I am assuming the higher up the hotel you go the more expensive the rooms are and maybe less noisy. It looked a beautiful hotel for a honeymoon or something special and the location was excellent. Step out of the hotel and you are right in the heart of Paris.

Just a stroll from Place Vandome and a cross from Opera Garnier, this property offers a great location for a sejour in Paris. I found this is a nice hotel, but I would not consider it as \"Le Plus Grand\" in Paris. I consider this property more as 4 star hotels. There are plenty others such as Park Hyatt Vendome, George V, H\u00f4tel Fouquet's Barri\u00e8re, H\u00f4tel Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Paris, H\u00f4tel de Crillon , Ritz Paris etc which I consider more as true 5 stars properties.

The arrival went smooth - I found the front desk agent very friendly and went through all the check in procedures well (inclusive reconfirm our room type preferrence, etc).

A Positive remark that i can praise for - is the Japanese breakfast style option - this is a plus value - and very seldom for european style Hotel. The Concierge was very helpful and knowledge. Great Clef D'or Concierge staff. One small negative remark that i can share - is regarding the Bathroom. Overall it is clean and nice - but unfortunately it needed a renovation for the wall and around the window. It is not a major fact but certainly for the standard room rate of \u20ac439 / night - one expect a good well maintain room. We mentioned this small remark to the front desk agent upon check-out , and she apologized for it. A few small points that the hotel maybe can put into their considerations: - Complimentary Tee or coffee in room - Complimentary Internet access - Ice machine on the floor (as the room service for a bucket of ice cost 10 \u20ac) This I can understand from Four Seasons / Ritzcarlton or Aman Resorts point of view but not from Intercontinental Hotel. Overall, I found this is a wonderful hotel. The service provided is great and fit to the 4 stars hotel category. It has an excellent location - great for shopping and pleanty outside dinning options to choose. Will I be back to this property again ?

I don't think I could stay here if I had to pay out of my own pocket. As a Priority Club platinum member, we were upgraded to the top floor with two balconies overlooking the boulevard and a view of the Eiffel Tower. The room was immaculate. The bed (two singles to make a King) was probably the most comfortable bed I've ever had. Down, I think, comforters and a plush mattress. Linens were soft and smooth. I certainly got a sense that this place knows how to cater to those with high expectations, considering the room rate. Very romanitic appointments throughout. Almost museum like where your not sure if you can sit down or just look at the chairs in the lobby. The concierge was so helpful. We purchased the red bus tickets and Eiffel Tower elevator tickets there. Good thing because the line at the Tower was around 3 hours if you had to purchase on site. He also directed us to a little grocery store around the corner and we stocked up on water, fruit and snacks. Actually, the tap water there was pretty darn good, so we never bought water again. Taxi's were always waiting outside so no wait to go anywhere. Check in/out was a breeze. Always someone there for every task, from getting the taxi, to holding bags (we checked out and they held our bags until our train left later that night), to a quick introduction to the hotel. Very organized and not pushy at all. I was prepared from other reviews to eat outside the hotel. Good gracious!...and no refills! There were plenty of side cafes and restaurants within 5 blocks that you didn't have to break the bank to eat. The red bus tour stopped around 2 blocks from the hotel and it is a great way to see all the typical sites. I've read a few complaints about the headphones not working and I would have complained too until we finally understood how to use them. All recorded and timed so you can tour at your own pace (hop on, hop off). The Louvre is a bit a a stretch to walk, but not too bad. I think about a mile or so? Staff was very friendly and I didn't pick up any snootiness or anti-tourist, anti-American tensions I've heard about the French. Guess you can't believe everything you read :-) The mini-bar had a power adapter that it seems many guests have figured out how to use it and put it back in the package and not be charged. Even the front desk asked if we were going to keep it (they seemed to know everyone does it). Bathroom was elegant and comfortable. Nice robes and slippers. There was a nice quiet city sound at night when we opened the windows. A touch of traffic, a hint of conversation, and a nice breeze. Just beautiful. I think the large trees lining the street filtered out a lot of noise. Not much variety in TV channels, but who wants to watch TV when visiting Paris?

It is definitely of 5 star quality. My husband treated me to two nights in Paris for my 30th birthday as a surprise. I felt like a queen at Grand Hotel Intercontinental. The staff were very very polite and helpful. The hotel is located quite centrally and very near to the Lourve and just accross from the Opera House (Music Academy of Paris). We had a very good room. It was large and spacious and so very clean and fresh with a direct view of the Opera House. The toiletries were in abundance and not just any toiletries - they used L'Occitaine, which is one of favourite to use and are quite expensive. I was surprised at how much was left in the room everyday - a bag was left on the bed, in the shower, near the bath and on the vanity table too. I never bothered to take toiletries home with me but this time, I did! The hotel deco was very grand with high ceilings and plants about. The reception area is very clean and guests are expected to dress properly for dinner. The concierge recommended a great french restaurant but I have forgotten its name. They served the best food we have ever had! It didn't look posh from the outside but they surely did deliver the quality of food. We have been to Paris before (2002) and so we knew what we wanted to do and planned properly for it (my husband did)! We had 3 days to explore and had a great time. On the last day, I ordered a hot chocolate at the hotel whilst waiting to go to the airport and was very impressed. It was the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted. The real thing - HOT CHOCOLATE, not powder. It was served in a small silver jug and enough for 2 cups and cost 8\u20ac but it was worth ever sip. We will definitely stay here again if we had the chance. It is a very expensive hotel at probably 500\u20ac a night for the room we stayed in. Definitely a luxury hotel and not to be done in vain! For new Paris visitors, make sure you get to the top of the Eiffel tower, definitely have a hot chocolate 'Paris style', visit the Lourve, the Notre Dame (get to the top of the tower for great views), take a walk along the river Seine at night and watch the Eiffel Tower from Chaillot Palace, which is near to arc de triomphe. Also take the hop on and hop off tourist bus to serve as your transport for the day. Very easy to get around and a good way to see most of the sites of Paris. Make sure you eat French food.

Quelle surprise! Yum yum, it was delicious! There was also a birthday card in the room from customer relations staff and --great touch--a personal welcome card from the hotel manager. We had breakfast each morning of our stay--7 days --in the lovely Cafe de la Paix--which is, in effect the hotel's dining room. What an experience in itself! Beautiful rooms, delicious food for the most part except for the coffee which was nothing like as good as the coffee available in other parts of the hotel, it tasted like cheap instant stuff and I'm sure the milk was UHT rather than fresh. Didn't seem to have cream available at breakfast for coffee. The bar prices are of course, eye-watering high. Coffee--although far better than the breakfast stuff , is about ten euros and the cheapest smallest glass of wine about thirteen euros. But, hey, this is central Paris and it dont come cheap! Another little quibble is the lack of any kind of hospitality in the bedrooms such as tea or coffee or water or fruit--even the most humble B&B here in Scotland will have these as standard in their rooms. For the record , we were staying in a Superior Room with view of the Eiffel Tower. Maybe you have to be club class for such basic hospitality items but when you think of the room rates, surely basic items such as I've mentioned are a mere bagatelle to Intercontinental? The concierge desk staff I found a trifle--let's say brisk--in how they spoke. That said, they did organise for us both to have Afternoon Tea at the Ritz--the price? if you have to ask, you cant afford it! Overall, I would most certainly recommend this hotel, it might not be the cheapest in Paris but remember you are not buying a bed for the night, you are buying into a luxury hotel and the experience of staying there---in any case, it's not the dearest either but gives the Ritz a run for its money when it comes to looks.

The location for a start is uneatable: right in the centre of Paris's great shopping district; just above the Auber RER station and within walking distance of most of what you want to go to in Central Paris. The place was completely renovated a few years ago. The main effect was to make all of the rooms much smaller. I have a Royal Ambassador card so I usually get upgraded to a junior suite. Even these are not that big; the \"classic rooms\" are tiny. The decor was also changed to some kind of Second Empire theme -- it's fine buta bit pretentious.

The refusal to standardise amenities around the world means no kettle or coffee maker in the room -- if you want a cup of tea or coffee, you need to call room service, wait 20 minutes and pay 7 Euros. I bring a travel kettle and a cup but it's annoying and forces me to the Hilton occasionally. The minibar prices and room service are incredibly high if you don't have the RA card (a 50 Euro breakfast is easy) but there's a supermarket 10 minutes walk away (behind the Printemps) that is open until 9.50 pm.

The gym used to be great -- well equipped and on the rooftop -- but not now. In the renovation, it became the Executive Lounge and the gym was moved to the first floor. Now, it has a few pieces of decent cardiovascular equipment but no resistance machines and no weights to speak of. The rest of the space is given over to a new-age, high-priced spa.

From the moment we arrived on the Monday afternoon to a 4.00pm check out on New Years Day it was flawless. We are Ambassador members and we booked a club interconti room, on arrival were upgraded to an executive room and while it overlooked a busy street, it was extremely quiet. We incurred no room intrusions and as mentioned previously we felt we had the wing to ourselves. The facilities at the club lounge were spot on. Have been to Paris many times and this has been the best experience. It is certainly not the cheapest option but for its class it does offer good value when compared to some of its competitors. My advice is give it a go.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cSerious service related problems at this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Monamonique", "ReviewID": "UR22412411", "Content": "As is indicated in some of the other reviews, there is a serious customer service related problem at this hotel. I am used to the \"Gallic indifference\" one encounters in Paris, and in fact sometimes find it quite funny and charming. But the attitude of the staff at this hotel is not indifferent, it is hostile and incredibly rude. The problems we encountered at check in could have easily been resolved, as we are Gold Ambassador members and had all the details of our reservation in writing. However, after going into the back room, somehow they mysteriously produced an alternate reservation for an inferior room, and they absolutely refused to honor our original reservation, even though we got the Ambassador representative in the US on the phone to try and help. (She spoke with the manager, and gave up, apologizing to us for the problem, but agreeing that they were not going to honor the reservation no matter what she tried) This is a very large hotel, and it was not full, but they gave us a room that was so loud from the sound of the Metro and the outside street noise that, when I called to request a different room, I held up the phone, and the Manager said \"WHAT is that noise\"? When I told him that is what it sounded like in our room, he said that there was nothing he could do about noise, and hung up! Finally, after many calls and tears, we got a different manager on the night shift, and the problems were solved, but by that time it was 7:30 PM. During our short stay, we heard three different customers bitterly complaining or arguing about the treatment they were receiving, and one employee quietly apologized and told us that she had worked at other Intercontinental hotels in Europe and had never seen such terrible treatment of loyalty members. This is a beautiful hotel, incredibly convenient, and should be a pleasure to stay at. It is expensive, but if you are taking a special occasion trip, or money is not a real issue, then this hotel should be on the top of the list of possible places to stay in Paris. We have stayed here in the past, and did not encounter these terrible problems. But something has happened, and this hotel is no longer to be recommended. However, if you can tolerate the treatment, and do not care what you get for the money, but just want an expensive hotel in a terrific location, then by all means stay here. Bring a clock, because none of the rooms have one, and be prepared to argue about all of the charges they will add to your bill unless you protest. Prepare to pay dearly for coffee/tea as there is no kettle in the room, prepare to have the room service charge for bringing ice to the room taken off your bill (there is no other way to get ice than calling room service, and although they don't charge for the ice, they do try to access a service charge to bring it to the room), and hope that when you arrive and depart one of the more accommodating managers is on duty. I'm sorry to say this about this hotel, as I have loved it in the past, but I won't be staying there again.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bodenseher", "Title": "\u201cGrand!\u201d", "Author": "bodenseher", "ReviewID": "UR22318854", "Content": "We spent one night in the Le Grand Hotel Intercontinental, paid with Priority Club points (40.000 points, no breakfast).

We booked a 2 night stay in a superior room with club access, which according to the booking site was one level below the junior suite. Now, as ambassador members you get a one level upgrade, so I was surprised to see that our booking had been updated to an Executive room with club access instead. This particular combination isn\u2019t available on the booking site, so one might say this is to prevent ambassadors getting into the suites. After a few emails to and fro pointing out this injustice, this was rectified to a junior suite as an \u201cexceptional upgrade\u201d. Upon arrival (it's just outside the Opera metro station) we were greeted by the check-in staff (although no-one was there at the entrance to open the doors for us) and sent upstairs to the private check in by the very welcoming and helpful club lounge staff. All was very good, although as we had arrived early (12:30pm) the room that we were allocated wasn\u2019t ready. No problem \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as if we\u2019d had a long journey. They stored our bags and took my mobile number so that they could call me when it was ready, which they duly did a few hours later. The room was lovely, if slightly smaller than I\u2019d imaged, but I guess I\u2019m being a little picky. The bathroom was big, with a separate shower and bath, there were 3 small balcony areas with a lovely view out towards the Eiffel tower \u2013 the Opera is nice, but personally I think this view is the better one! Complimentary water, fruit and biscuits were delivered soon after, but the staff member came into the room despite a very loud \u201cCan you come back later please\u201d from inside. It wasn\u2019t until later that we noticed that there wasn\u2019t any tea or coffee facilities in the room (although they are available free of charge at the club lounge 24/7). The TV was also a little small and disappointing and there was no separate radio / CD player. The club lounge itself was great \u2013 a full free bar and food from 6pm in the evening for 2 hours, followed up by free champagne for the rest of the evening. That glass of free champagne would cost about 16 euros downstairs, so it really is worth paying the extra for club access. We tended to go there for drinks and nibbles before we went out for food, cutting down the cost of eating out, which in Paris is expensive! The only quibble I would say is that the lounge closes at 10pm \u2013 not late enough for any post meal relaxation. It also includes breakfast, which offered a good selection of hot and cold items. However, the cafe le paix downstairs also does breakfast and as we were staying for the weekend I\u2019d booked the hotel\u2019s luxury weekend rate which included breakfast and a late checkout. On the first morning we headed down and had a very nice breakfast, in lovely surroundings. Lunch and Evening Customers pay a lot of money to sit here (the hotel is situated right next to the opera house, so it\u2019s a place to be seen), so I wasn\u2019t going to pass up the chance, even though we hadn\u2019t been specifically told breakfast was included there at check-in. At the end of breakfast I was given a slip to sign, which I thought was a little odd. Afterwards, I checked with the usually helpful club lounge staff who, unusually turned on the Gallic shrug of the shoulders and said that it wasn\u2019t included. Ahh well, some you win... we thought. However, I\u2019d checked against the printed out booking and later on went back to check again with the staff \u2013 it appeared that the cost of breakfast hadn\u2019t made its way on to our bill, so there wasn\u2019t in the end a problem, but either another unlucky customer had 2 extra breakfasts added to their bill or they had finally got it right. We didn\u2019t chance it on the second morning though \u2013 the club lounge was our destination then! If you do stay on the club make sure you check out the splendour of the rest of the hotel \u2013 the ball room is quite amazing and is usually not occupied during the weekdays \u2013 pop in and take a look, you\u2019ll more than likely get it all to yourself! All in all it was a lovely stay \u2013 Paris is a wonderful, if expensive city to visit, but despite all its splendour there are a few basics with this hotel that were missing.

Location: Extremely convenient with respect to commute to and from the airport. The Roissy bus stop is about 100 meters from the hotel entrance. With respect to being a convenient base for tourism, I have some mixed feelings. Very close to certain landmarks like the Opera, Vendome and the Madeline, and for those who don't mind walking a bit, within walking distance from the Louvre. But the neighborhood itself is basically a busy shopping district (Lafayette and Printemps within 5 minutes walk), without the typical easy access to cozy cafes and intimate restaurants. What this means is that for those people (such as ourselves) who prefer to dine and hang out in neighborhoods such as Saint Germain and Latin Quarter, the hotel is a bit of a pain. Rooms: It's a hotel in Paris. Rooms are small, but at least Le Grand has separate shower and toilet. Clean and well-kept. Restaurant: The main restaurant (Cafe de la Paix) does a reasonable buffet breakfast and above-average dinner.

My husband stays at least 20 nights each month in hotels for business. That being said, we have a ton of priority points and decided to use them for our 7 day stay.

We were checked in by a very abrasive woman, who seemed to be \"put upon\" just by having to do her job. Second, this is not a luxury hotel. This is the second Intercontinental we have stayed at and niether can be considered luxurious. We have stayed at Holiday Inn Express hotels that were 200 % better than this property. We were glad to have used points to pay for the stay. If we had paid out of pocket, we would have never checked in. The traveler photos here, are accurate. But, photos are photos and much is not seen and comfort cannot be felt visually. There was bottled water and a plate of fruit when we entered the room. The fruit was covered in mold. Upon giving it to the staff, nothing was said. I guess this is the \"norm\". As mentioned in some reviews here, our room too, was entered frequently without explanation. It is our belief that they enter the room in order to turn off the air conditioning. The woman who entered our room was not housekeeping. We were dressing for dinner when she entered and we tried to stop her but she bolted down the hallway as we were asking what she needed. We started leaving the t.v. on to deter any entering. Before this, we came back to our room to find the air conditioning off. We understand saving energy.....but the air conditioning system didn't do a good job of cooling the room and trying to get the room cool after it was off for several hours was difficult. The concierge desk was another area that could be greatly improved. Upon arriving in Paris we had no luggage. Air France for whatever reason failed to put our baggage on the plane in NYC. Not a huge deal, we are world travelers, we've had lost bags, delayed bags, many, many times. We have the ability to buy what we need. The concierge desk was informed that we were expecting our bags to be delivered. We were without our bags for 2 days and when we finally were informed the bags had made it to Paris and would be delivered between 9pm and midnight, we went to the concierges' desk and told them, that no matter what time the bags arrived, to please have them sent up. He even asked, \"If they arrive at 2am, send them up?\" \"Yes,\" we said. \"No matter what time it is.\" At 12:30 am my husband calls to see if they have shown up yet. Yes, they had shown up some time ago, is what we were told. Upon asking if someone can bring them up, we were told.....yes, in about 20 minutes. Frustrating to say the least.

My wife had a few treatments at the spa on the morning of her birthday and being a spa junkie she was very complimentary of the masseuse and spa staff.I would suggest booking in advance as it does get busy. We done all the usual touristy things...louvre, eiffle tower, champs elysee and so on. Most are within walking distance if moderately fit and healthy if not Paris taxis very reasonable. If you do plan to go to the Eiffle tower get your tickets from the concierge, they will be more expensive than the face value but you will avoid the queus...we went at 9 am saturday morning and were suprised to see at least 500 people waiting to purchase tickets, we joined the blue queue and were on the first lift up to the second floor when the tower opened at 930, we took the usual holiday snaps then took the lift to the top...we were at the top at 945am with only 2 other people...simply wonderful.

Our room was on the 3rd floor in the Opera wing and contained a small entrance area with mini-bar and a door to the toilet, a fairly large main bedroom area with a huge comfortable king sized bed, one wall of wardrobes/drawers with a widescreen TV located within the inset, a desk, a table, a few chairs, a bathroom with small bathtub and a walk-in shower - toiletries are L'Occitane which are very good indeed - and tall windows (in both the bathroom and the main bedroom) which opened up allowing access to a balcony - we had a fantastic view of the opera house. The room had a slight musty smell which we managed to reduce by opening the windows as often as possible to let in fresh air. Street noise at night with the windows closed is ok, but the slight vibration/noise from the metro every 5 minutes from early until late can be a little annoying - I'm not sure if this affects the entire hotel - but if I'd been paying the full rate of \u20ac740 a night (!) then I'd have been unhappy. We noticed some small imperfections which you'd think would have been checked/repaired: small patch of peeling wallpaper in toilet, a flaking ceiling in the shower, and the bathroom sink plug wouldn't stay closed. Saying that, I've experienced similar problems in almost every 4 or 5 star hotel I've stayed in. Location wise it is very good, a short walk to some large department stores (the food hall at La Fayette is gorgeous), the Louvre, the Seine, a selection of cinemas often showing films in the original language (identified by V.O. in the listings), and obviously the Opera metro station is very close. A tip here: turn right from the hotel's main lobby when exiting, and there is a small station entrance at the end of Rue Scribe. Breakfast in the Cafe De La Paix was good but I doubt we'd have paid the \u20ac37.50 charge if it had not been included in our room rate when you can get breakfast at a cafe for around \u20ac8-15. However the breakfast choice was amazing (eggs made to order, huge range of fruit, bread, hot breakfast items, smoked salmon, cold meat, and a good Japanese section too - only surprise was a very poor range of cheese: a brie and 3 different very plain mild cheese slices - in Paris?!). The service was reasonable. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient, as were the concierge: the tickets we purchased here for the Eifel Tower (level 2 only) and the Louvre bypassed the need to queue for tickets at either place (saving at least 45 minutes at the Tower), and I can absolutely recommend the restaurant which the concierge booked for us: the Gallopin (see www DOT brasseriegallopin DOT com) - average 3 courses here with wine from the a la carte was \u20ac50-60, and it's a 15 minute stroll from the hotel. The spa seemed to be very good, and the prices appeared to be reasonable - the gym is small for a 500 room hotel but the 8 machines they have are very good, and the sauna was good. Had a slight problem at check-out with the breakfast being charged to the room, When I pointed out this was an error, I was then told the rate did not include breakfast. I insisted it did (I had the print out of the reservation which stated this, it is a standard part of a \"luxury weekend\" booking, and I was told at check-in that breakfast was included), so they checked their paperwork, found out it was, apologised, and removed this from the account.

I even asked my agent and the hotel directly was there another Intercontinental in Paris. The one I later found out I did stay at is now the Westin. It changed about 1 year ago, so this hotel was the other location after all! I had called directly to inquire about upgrades,prepaying entirely, and the embassy club...to see if they had a problem with the free night or the room upgrade that comes with it. They said it depended on availability for an upgrade. When I had stayed at the Intercontinental in Paris..now Westin, 5 yrs ago, rooms were great, so was service, locale, etc. When we arrived, after a long flight from Atlanta, we were checked in by a frontdesk person who said he was new. He said we would have to wait a few hours to get an upgraded room. I said no problem, it would be worth it for me. He spoke to a woman next to him and she told him to put us in a room ready now. After going to the tiny room I called front desk and said I know the hotel, and this is not an upgrade. They said they were full and that is all they have. I said I will wait, I am not staying in such a tiny room that is not an upgrade being an embassdor member. After telling me to wait in the bar and I would have a room in a few minutes, they just left me hanging , finally after an hour I went to the desk and they said youre room has been ready. Went to the room, a bit larger, but not upgraded.The staff at the front desk, except for the Asian woman who checked us out, were very rude, condescending, could care less if we were happy or ever stayed there again. Room key never worked and everytime we took it back to the desk they said it was our fault,,must have been by our cell phone. It was not. Before going to the hotel I asked was breakfast included, they said yes we were on the floor for members as we were and included breakfast. We went there and the girl curtly told us it was for special members, not us, and that was it. I agree with what the other writer from the oct stay said about the folks who work there at the front desk. Location was fine, not as good as previous Intercontinental now Westin. Which for my money is where I would stay.

I was so excited! It was my first trip to Paris. Unfortunately, money was stolen by a member of the hotel staff and no one at the Intercontinental addressed the situation appropriately. Apparently, the card reader system that tracks who enters and exits the hotel room was broken only for our room! We asked them to fix the card reader so that at least we had some sense of safety after the theft but the hotel never fixed the card system. They did not move us to a safer room. They discouraged us from filing a police report. The way it worked is that the hotel room has a separate room for the toilet and a separate room for the shower. My partner was using the toilet and I was using the shower. A hotel staff member entered the hotel room with fruit and water and I was completely naked in the shower, I asked him to go away. When my partner and I came back out, we noticed that the money was out of his wallet and that money was missing from the wallet. We contacted the hotel management immediately and they did nothing. They told us they would try to read the card reader system - they found out it was broken and did nothing to fix it. They said they would contact the hotel security manager - he did nothing except to say that the card system reader was broken. The only compensation that they gave to us was a 50 euro correction on our hotel bill. We paid thousands of dollars to stay for one week in this hotel. Usually, I am a very easy going person as I understand that different hotels have different problems and they need time to resolve their problems but this was absolutely horrendous.

In general, I found the staff to be exceptionally friendly, competent, and professional -- probably the best hotel service I've ever experienced in Paris, after a number of stays at other hotels, both large and small. I stayed for six nights with my wife and 2-year-old son, and the bell staff would always leap at the chance to help us with our bags or our stroller going up or down the stairs, and they always did so with a smile. In addition, the concierge was very efficient and humorous -- helped us out greatly with making babysitting arrangements and confirming dinner reservations. It's true that babysitting services are expensive at the hotel (25 Euros per hour plus tip) but that seems to be the going rate at the 4-star hotels in Paris. The one exception to the general friendliness I encountered was with the staff at the spa, who seemed rather cold and indifferent. We stayed in a junior suite, which was not huge -- basically, two small rooms separated by a double door -- but more than enough for a couple with a young kid. It was nicely furnished and well maintained. In fact, the housekeeping was so swift that we never saw them, even though our room was always cleaned as soon as we got back from either breakfast or lunch. We got a decent deal on the rate -- 330 Euros per day (including access to the \"Club\" for part of our stay), which is certainly not cheap, but pretty good for what you can get in Paris. I agree with those reviewers who recommend access to the Club room, which was very comfortable. They kept the breakfast buffet out until noon (great for our first couple of days when we were jet-lagged and would sleep until past 10am), and then the afternoon and evening drinks and snacks were also nice. Our two-year-old loved relaxing in the big chairs with milk and cookies in the evening. My only disappointment was that we were only able to use the club for three out of our six nights because JP Morgan had somehow managed to reserve the club (as well as a huge chunk of the hotel) for its own private function for the other three nights. That was somewhat annoying. The fitness room had four treadmills, one stair-stepper, one elliptical trainer, and one stationary bicycle, all relatively new, so it was OK for cardio. Unfortunately, the weight selection was weak -- just a few dumbbells -- so it was not a good option for strength training. At least there was always bottled water, juice, and a lot of fresh fruit on hand. Did not get a chance to eat at Cafe de la Paix this time, but we had been there years before (before the renovation) and had enjoyed it. Now, post-renovation, the interior looks beautiful, with high prices on the menu to match! The main reason we stayed at Le Grand was the excellent location right next to the Opera Garnier. Perfect for shopping at the big department stores, metro access, and walking to nearby monuments, museums (esp. Louvre and Orangerie), and the Tuileries Gardens.

I would recommend getting a Club room which has access to the Club lounge. The lounge is a oasis of calm and overlooks the Opera; it is pure Paris.

As you can imagine it was fairly expensive but not thrilling; moreover, the young man serving me knew nothing about wine when I complained it was corked; however, the bottle was replaced. Breakfast was better; the hotel tries to cater for all nationalities; Asian guests, for example, can eat food local to their our country. Overall, although I had one or two niggles about the quality of service, I would definitely return to Le Grand. Why?

After apologizing to my partners about the delay, I went up in the room and after another 15 minutes without my luggage arriving, I start calling the guest service manager. The lady named Ann (guest service) told me that the luggage is on the way and will be there in 3 minutes. I told her that I\u2019m listening this story already 45 minutes, and let they tell me where is my luggage, so I can really go and take it myself.

The metro, the Louvre, the Rue St. Honore are within walking distance. I was pleasantly surprised with this huge hotel that I have seen, but never been in before, for many years. The hotel is very large indeed; you will need a long walk to your room. The rooms, for the most part are extremely small, as are the bathrooms. The bath tub and shower were very tiny, with a propensity to scatter water all over the (marble=slippery) floor. Even the soap was miniscule. Closet space was small, even for one person. I can't imagine two people staying in the room for much longer than one night. With the exception of the business center, which charged 12 Euros per half hour to use the computer, but had an excellent and efficient staff, the rest of the staff was rather impersonal and indifferent: civil, but not inclined to go out of their way for anyone.

It was a bit of a challenge - from the poor water pressure from the shower head, to the half shower door - quite honestly, every morning, I dreaded this process. I was surprised that they didn't have a deluxe rain shower and a full-fledged shower door, but perhaps this was part of the design......? After each shower, there wa a bit of water spillage on the floor, but nothing too serious. The cleaning staff made the room up perfect each day, so there was never a worry. The amenties provided in the room were very nice - Molton Brown products from the neighboring \"Old England\" store next to the hotel. The only negative that my husband was upset about was the fact that there was no bedside radio in the room. If you wanted a radio or music, you can access it on your wide screen bedroom TV, but at a cost. We didn't sign up for the music service, but certainly missed this bedroom standard during our stay.

The room had internet access and the right adapter for any of your non-european appliances or electonics. Funny enough, the adapter is kept in the mini-bar and they forget to mention this when you check in. The location cannot be beat. The hotel is right outside the Opera metro stop (which is a hub metro stop where you can catch lots of other lines) and you are centrally located to almost all of Paris. Overall, the staff is friendly, courteous and knowledgable. The Cons: The hotel is very large and when you go up to the floor where your room is located you might feel as if you are staying at a convention hotel. Our room was facing the Opera Garnier (the best view and side of the hotel- which I highly recommend), however, when you get off the elevator be prepared for a hike to your room. It can feel like a overwhelming walk especially after a long day of walking and sightseeing in the city. Like all Eurpoean hotels, you must remember certain translations problems. When you say 2 beds, this can translate into one big bed with one headboard but two separate mattresses (see picture). When you say a big room, this can translate into a room with no sitting area, one big bed that you can get out of without hitting the wall next to you and a tiny closet for 2 people. Our room was one of the better rooms with balconys off the bedroom and bathroom looking at the Opera Garnier but still felt very small. When I asked the front desk about it they said it was the top floor and the ceiling sloped so it probably felt smaller. Clearly, they just don't have the same definition of big. The shower - OK we all know how this works in Europe. Can someone please tell me how that silly glass half door is supposed to keep the shower water in the tub versus on the floor of the bathroom??!! (see picture) The hand held shower does not make this any better because the shower door moves off the tub if you hit it with your arm (which you will do) and the water bounces off the tub onto the floor. I always needed at least 2 big towels to take a shower, one for me, one for the floor. The hairdryer. You have to hold down the button while you blow dry your hair or it stops. I think for this level of hotel they can do better. The price - this is a very expensive hotel. For the space you get, in your room, you must adjust your expectation level or you will be disappointed. Definitety have your meals outside the hotel. There is a great little cafe near the hotel - come out the main entrance make a left and then your first right. You will see it off on its own across the street. It is lovely and reasonable. Also, \"Paul\" is a chain of high quality sandwiches and pasteries. There are several in the area and great for a quick bite.

It was the perfect place to go when we were hungry or thirsty between meals. PROS: Beautiful building, wonderful bed, perfect location. The Concierges were great about getting us reservations at all the restaurants we wanted and they made great recommendations as well. The breakfast buffet at Cafe de la Paix is awesome, though slightly pricey. The air conditioning! Apparently many hotels do not have it, it was hot and we needed it.

They were friendly and helpful and the concierge confrimed all of our dinner reservations while we waited. However, the room itself was quirky. We had booked a room with a view and instead got one with a view of the other side of the hotel. The room seemed small and the bathtub/shower was problematic. It was broken when we got there (they had to call maintance to come immediately and fix it, which to their credit they did do) and standing in the shower, it is impossible to stay under the spray without closing the drain on the bathtub so by the end of the shower, the tub is full. Our wake up calls were sporadic-coming sometimes ten minutes late or two hours early and they were very sorry about that. The safe broke twice.

But what you can do, it's hard to find truly good servants in this days ;-) On arrival we have been assigned a \"superior\" room, on the second floor. This was quite a small room, all in red colours. Not that great, I have to say - too small and too red ^^. But the worst thing was that you was able to hear the traffic rumours from the street below ! Even when I have closed the windows, curtains and everything that was possible to close, the rumour was still clearly present! I have called the reception, and have asked for another room - the answer was \"it's already evening, and it's very difficult for us to move you in another room\" !!! And we have arrived just 10 minutes ago.... So I demanded to speak with a manager, and surprise, surprise - them found not one, but 2 rooms that we could choose from ! The very competent and nice manager arrived and showed the rooms to us - man, this rooms were all other story ! Much bigger, finished with nice yellow colours.... so we accepted one of the rooms strait away. There were no traffic rumours at all this time. The breakfast was really expensive, looked like a rip-off to us. So we used a small cafe outside - it's about 5-6 times cheaper and the food was ok. Apart from the manager, the rest of the staff looked a bit snobby to me, but I guess it's a general problem in Paris. Them forgot to give me the Ambassador gift - so I have to ask for it. The concierge directed us to a totally wrong place when I have asked him for a address of one of boutiques that I would like to visit. The volume of TV was blocked on such a low level that we had to do our best in order to be able to hear the words in the movie ( pay-per-view, them have tried to bill it to us, even if it's offered to Ambassadors ^^ ). On the departure day I have advised them that we will stay till 16.00 ( another ambassador privilege ), we went out, came back to the hotel around 14.30 - and the keys for the room did not work anymore! So I have to go down, and ask the clerk to reprogram them - not even word of apologise !!! This does not happen in other lux hotels ! So the service was not really perfect, but the hotel itself and the room was great - a truly opulent and luxurious place.Would recommend the place for a short stay in Paris, but in case I will ever come back to the town ( actually I did not liked it much, really old, bit dirty and the people seems to be a bit full of themselves ) I would try a different place - Ritz, Four Seasons and others are available !

I had stayed at the \"other\" Intercontinental last year which has become a Westin. I booked thru the hotel web site- $387 euros for a triple. A triple was 2 super comfy twins put together but with separate down duvets and a nice size cot. I am a member of the hotels' Ambassador club ($150/year)which gets you a free weekend night stay. It was easy to use....so I paid approx $900 for 3 nights which is not bad. If the third person is over 18, they add 80 eurs/night to the fee. We did get a paper everyday, and a welcome gift- but it was a heavy glass vase with tangerines which looked nice but since there was no note, I did not know until the end when I saw a carry bag that it was designed to be taken home by club members. How many will carry a heavy glass vase ( really a tall cylinder?). There was also a 1/2 bottle of wine and 2 bottles of water. We were not escorted to our room by a \"club\" manager as she was \"tied up\" but she did leave a long message in French which we got just after settling in which I assume was meant to see if we needed anything. Here is what I found: I had access to the club floor which I found helpful since we were 3 people who wanted breakfast at different times. The food & drinks were plentiful. I learned by day 3 if you want something different- you should ask. My 14 year old wanted \"cereal\" but did not see it. Upon asking, it was brought to her. The club is beautiful but caterers to smokers as the second floor (smoking) is 5 times the size and has all of the couches and comfy chairs. It also has 2 high speed computers that were not very busy during our stay. They were enjoyed by my teen who loved using the instant messaging to friends back home. The lower level has the main food and a nice TV but only eating tables and chairs. I found the staff to answer questions when asked but they did not go out of their way \"four seasons\" style to engage you or call you by name. When I aksed the concierge at the club desk to reconfirm my Jules Verne reservation- she suggested the main concierge in the lobby do it. This distinction in service to me is what separates the Intercontinental from the other top brands. I guess I was waiting for someone to ask \"how my day was\" or if I needed any help before heading out. Their main function was food upkeep and keeping things tidy which may not leave them much energy for small talk. They do check you in and out and I did notice they seemed to keep track of assistance they did render to guests in a log book. Rooms: Beautifully decorated, very nice size....but in our room we had 2 window balconies covered by heavy drapes and furntiure- one in the bathroom and one in the main room. You had to move the table, slide the heavy drape and step up 1 foot to access it-very odd. Even more strange is that it appears that in the multi-million dollar renovation they replaced the toilets in the bathroom with gorgeous stall glass showers. So....where is the toilet? In a small room near the entry area- great you say? Well- it is just a toilet, no garbage can, towel rack, mirror or sink. That means if you use the toilet, you need to walk 15 feet to wash your hands. Now does that make sense? Housekeeping twice a day was nice as were the plentiful Molton Brown products, but on my first day, the room was not made up by 4pm and then on the last night I asked for turndown after 8pm and it was done by 6pm. The housekeepers, although very polite, spoke little English. The location of the hotel is amzaing- right next to the Opera House and a metro stop with access to all the major lines. The lobby and common areas are worthy of brides in and out all day for photo shoots. I did not see the spa and gym but saw many people in robes walking around! The main think I learned is that if you pay alot of money for your room and it is as grand as this hotel, you tend to come back a bit more and put up your feet.

On the front end we stayed at the Intercontinental on rue de Castiglione. (Another post) However, as my husband stays at the LeGrand on business, he insisted we spend at least one night there. This hotel is great if you are on business and I can understand its appeal for that reason. However, for a vacation traveler it was not what I like in a hotel. As at the Intercontinental we stayed on the Club level. However, at the LeGrand I felt uncomfortable. The staff was not friendly and I felt that I needed to flash my I.D. everytime we walked into the Club area. We had to have someone type in an ID and password on the computer each time we wanted to use it and the staff insisted upon making our drinks for us. The hotel is plush and lavish and the wide screen T.V. had a personal welcome on it. However, on the day of our departure, we requested bag pick-up at ll:00 a.m. and exactly at ll:00 a.m. the T.V. went off. The room was large, the bathroom spacious and our room had a small balcony overlooking the street. No complaints about it at all. In my opinion the location is not as good as the Intercontinental unless you are attending the Opera every night. We did not eat at the hotel although my husband insists the food is excellent. While I know this hotel has recently been renovated and is most likely the Intercontinental's crown jewel in Paris, I was not sorry to leave. However, Benjamin, who assisted us upon check-in and obtained an upgrade for us to the Club level, was most helpful. He identified himself as the assistant manager and apologized for our no more than 60 second wait in line. I only wish that the rest of the staff we dealt with was as friendly as he. All in all there is nothing really bad about this hotel. If you are a shiek (my husband says Colin Powell has been sighted there) or some other important person or want to impress whomever, this is the place to stay.

The basic room is small - I've stayed in NYC hotels so I'm used to small, but this was by far the smallest room I've ever stayed in. The bed was a queen and took up at least 80% of the room. No view of the Opera from our room. One night our housekeeping crew left our windows open - at least 15 mosquitos invaded our room. We had no sleep that night, we stayed up trying to swat them all. We were given a free welcome gift of fruit - unfortunately, it was not fresh and some of the fruit was bruised. :-( Still, we were there for the sites of Paris and not the fruit.

We decided to book three rooms, 2, 2 and 3 in a room. Three of us, one from each room got an Ambassador Club membership and split the cost with the other person staying in the room so we all reaped the benefits! After booking with the hotel via internet, we picked the $254 (14 day advance) rate~ They did not bill us until we got there. It is there policy to wait until you arrive. I made contact with the concierge immediately via email as I wanted to establish a relationship before our arrival. This is the address in case you are interested:(---) They were wonderful!! Replied immediatley, to several requests, booking for Jules Verne restaurant at the top of the Effiel Tower, Pick up from the airport and back to airport and questions about upgrading and request for all of us to be on the same floor if possible. So far so good! Upon our arrival at CDG we were greeting immediately by our driver~ Thank God! I was a little nervous about that on the plane. He held up a name card and called our name out so we saw him within seconds. He was very friendly and gave us a tour as he drove to our hotel 20 mins away from the airport. Upon entering our hotel we KNEW we were in PARIS! At the check-in everything went smoothly and they were able to accommodate two rooms connecting to one another and the third room a few rooms away on the same floor. They upgraded all of us to JR. Suites and upgraded us again to full view of the Opera Garnier. What an amazing view! StoryBook Land. Metro right in front of the Opera House~ Thought that might be a problem with the noise~ But the only problem I encountered with noise at night was my mother's snoring~ Sorry Mom~ She said the same thing about me too! While waiting for the others to check-in we had our first cafe in the Paix Cafe~ 15 Euros with some pasteries,gratis~ expensive~yes~ priceless moment~ absolutely! Checked out the Grand Ballroom( where Karen and Raven said they would like to get married!) and the Lounge \" La Verri\u00e8re\" area where unbeknown to us we would gather every evening to have a nightcap and talk about our adventures for the next day! When you order a drink they bring you little bowls of olives, chips and some other snacks~ Very nice! Price of the drinks ranged from 6-15 Euros. I had the french beer for 6 Euros and it was fantastic! We arrive in our room ahhhhhhhhhh breath taking ~Clean, parisian, extravegant, View: breathtaking! I took photos ~ so make sure you check them out! Pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room! Bathroom was in a separate area in the front hallway~ Which was great because someone could use the vanity and the shower without being interrupted by the toilet! Plenty of storage space for hanging clothes~ We did have to ask for extra hangers which arrived 5 mins after the request!~ Plenty of drawer space~ Easy to use safe~ which we kept our passports and jewlery in. Amenities: Included use of the gym~ HELLO ~ I just got back from Weight Watchers and lost two pounds on this trip just from walking and we used the metro! I can assure you I did not keep track of my points! Lovely Spa: No time to use the spa services however two of the girls did get manicures and they were 15 E~ Not bad~ They commented that the manicurist was super friendly and wish we had more time to book a message and facial. Free Movie for Ambassador Club members~ No time to take advantage of this~ But I did browse through the list~ All movies available in different languages and English was one of them~ OH` And when you turned on the Plasma TV it said \"Welcome Sue Meyers\"~ Cute~ The room had a complete communications and entertainment center, multi national TV, video on demand and double phone lines with high-speed Internet connections. Didn't use the internet. Included also were two super fluffy bathrobes, slippers and blowdryer. We bought our own adaptors but they ahd them available at the hotel free of charge. Mini- Bar~ Expensive Fresh Fruit, bottled water and other goodies were waiting for us in the room. Turndown service nightly. Room Service~ Twice we ordered desserts ~ Excellent! The hotel itself is immaculate, the flowers beautifully groomed, every square inch of that hotel was a sight of magnificent beauty. The staff: housekeeping, reception area, concierge( Sophie and others) , everyone spoke English and everyone was extremely helpful, friendly, and polite. Service was exception. The Concierge: Every morning before our departure we checked in with them to plot out the metro route we were going to take. They took their time with us showed us on the map, and printed out directions for us. Of course that didn't stop us from getting on the wrong metro or heading in the wrong direction or even some getting off while the others could not get out hehehehe~ But by the second day we were champs~ The metro is directly in front of the hotel, very convenient! The surrounding area of the hotel is know as the Opera district. Very large Grand historical buildings. We had the Opera Garnier a hop, skip and a jump away. Place Vendome, which is the Town square was lovely with beautiful Sculptures. Famous: Happy Harry's, Willies Wine Bar and Buddha Bar are all within walking distance.
