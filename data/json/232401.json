We booked our accommodation at the Hotel Europa 92. Getting there from the airport was very easy and fast. We caught a taxi and only cost us 37euros total. The staff were very welcoming and helpful with whatever we asked for. The rooms and hotel were very clean with a lovely backyard that was perfect for some relaxing time. We stayed on BB and had the continental breakfast. The breakfast area was not very big but there was enough choice for everyone from the buffet - toast, cereal, orange juice, coffee machine, cheese & different types of fruits etc. The furniture in the room we had was a little outdated and might need refurbishing but the beds were extremely comfortable and spacious bathroom.The rest of the hotel was in very good condition. The hotel is situated very close to Vondelpark and many other places of interest. Thanks to the advice given by the receptionist, we enjoyed walking to the Heineken Experience, the Dam, Madame Tussauds and more.

I question how \"fresh\" the meats and cheeses were that they put out each morning for breakfast.

Hadn't been here before and will not be returning. Facility. The first thing I noticed was the strong smell of cigarettes that came into the reception area from the patio. The furniture, near the very small bar, had small burn holes from cigarettes. We arrived before check-in and the polite hotel staff told us to put our luggage under the open stair well and it would be fine (he was right) - but did not inspire confidence. There is a nice open air patio that is commonly used by smokers. As we checked in, we had to pay for the entire stay upfront and because we were using a credit card, had to pay a 4% surcharge. They offered a room safe - for an extra charge - that is barely big enough for a man's wallet and few other small items (smart phone)- certainly not the smallest laptop or tablet of any form. We walked up the very squeaky stairs - the hallway was very dirty and the carpets were stained. For example, the walls were scuffed, plaster walls cracked and the ceiling lamps/light bulbs in the hall way have browned/blackened the paint. Throughout our multiple day stay, there was consistent smell of smoke in the hallways that was coming from either outside or from the smoking rooms. The room was not better. The carpets were stained. We had a triple room that had 3 twin size beds. They were very soft and lumpy. One pillow/bed. There was only a bed cover, no individual sheets. The bathroom had mold on the showers. There was a generic liquid bath soap that is to be used as both shampoo and body wash. There was no clock and the lamp shade was broken. The phone had a number of missing buttons. I did like the fact that the closet locked. The floor of the room creaked loudly. The TV was 13 inches and had about 10 channels - most worked. You can pay an extra 8.5 Euros to get more channels - but you would still have to watch them on a 13 inch screen. We had a garden facing room. We had warm nights and with the lack of air conditioning, we had to leave the window open. Each night, the smell of tobacco smoke from the court yard would fill our room. The courtyard was quite after midnight - although from time to time - there would be people speaking on the phone in the courtyard that sounded like they were nearly in the room. Anyone walking in the hall would be easily heard footsteps. My best night sleep was wearing earplugs. Internet is available for 7.5 Euros for 24 hr and 1.0 Euro/hr. Went on one day to get a username/password and they said they could only offer me 1 hr for 2.5 Euros. Could not log into the internet from the room - had to go to the front desk. We came back one day to find that the room had not been cleaned. Breakfast was served each AM. It was exactly the same every day - breads (good), hams, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, cereal, coffee (had to order), orange juice. It was okay, although I stopped taking the yogurt after finding a hair in the bowel.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201caussie holiday\u201d", "Author": "rob228", "ReviewID": "UR118436413", "Content": "The room we had booked was very smelly and dirty.

There is a lovely garden off the lobby bar; unfortunately, the weather while I was there didn't lend itself to sitting outside. It's an odd building, I think two thrown together, so the room numbering system is idiosyncratic and there are lots of steps up and down (which might be a problem for someone who has difficulty with stairs). But that didn't bother me; in fact, it was a running joke between me and friends who also stayed there. Breakfast is good, but not included in the room rate. This hotel has endeared itself to me by one simple act. I was in Europe when the airspace was shut down due to the volcanic activity, and my flight was cancelled. I ended up spending three extra nights in Amsterdam. I had booked into the Europa quite some time in advance, via the Internet, and so received a very low rate. They honored that for additional three nights, which they didn't have to do, and did not charge for my breakfasts those extra days.

This hotel ticked all of these boxes. Unless you want to pay \u00c2\u00a3150 a night for a 4* then this is a very good option coming in at half that price. The flight into Schipol Airport (one of the best airports in the world) is followed by a short train journey (station underneath airport) to the Amsterdam Central Station costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.20 each (single) which you can buy tickets from the easy-to-use ticket machines in the airport foyer. These machines take credit cards (extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac0.50 but worth it if you haven't got a debit card that works like me) or coins only (no notes). From Amsterdam Central Station, catch the #1 tram outside the front doors to Constantijn Huygensstraat. You need small change!!! If you haven't already bought a tram ticket, board the tram at the middle doors where you buy a ticket from the conductor for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.60 that you can use for 1 hour. These tickets have to be scanned in and out for every trip on the card sensors. I really didn't understand the tram ticket strippenkaart system (something to do with 1 strip per zone) so I decided to buy a ticket for every trip. Maybe worth asking at the hotel. They are very friendly, as everyone seemed to be in Holland. You can walk to the hotel in about 30-40 mins from the station. We arrived at the hotel around 9.30am as we had an early morning flight and had a warm welcome. Our room was available so we took the very small elevator to the second floor to room 16 which was a triple room (double and single bed) which happened to be the only double bed available. We were glad that the room was no smoking and located at the rear of the hotel. It appeared quiet and clean but not as modern as the photos on the hotel website looked. Comfortable bed and a working shower. Good enough for sleeping and washing. Nice clean towels everyday. Safe on the wall didn't work. The Ritz it is not, neither is is the Hilton or the Marriot which is a change for us. We expected it not to be and were not disappointed on the whole. From this hotel you can walk to the Museum district (Rijksmuseum & Van Gogh) in 15 minutes, the Leidseplein in 5-10 minutes. Dam Square is about a 20 minute walk through the town centre, about the same to the Anne Frank House. The best way to see the city is to hire a City Bike from Dutch Bikes around the corner (minute walk) on Overtoom (heading towards the town centre) for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 per day (24 hours). Don't bother with the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 insurance as the bikes have a wheel lock and a heavy duty chain and lock. Get a city map from the hotel lobby (the free Macs Bike one is the best) and cycle to the De Gooyer windmill for breakfast (best toasties in the city), and go back after 3pm for a superb beer at the Brouwerij 't IJ. You must cycle around the docks and the parks to get an overall feel to this great city. The Vondelpark has a wonderful cafe for that most needed refreshments of coffees, snacks and beers! You can burn off the calories by cycling to Westerpark. If beer tasting is one of your interests, please don't miss Gollem Bar on Raamstraat in the town centre. Google it, worth going to and buy some bottles to take home from the shop opposite! Everyone should visit the Heineken Experience, a little pricey at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 but it's a great tour that lasts 2 hours and 3 free beers. Great for non-art lovers. They even let you pull your own beer in the bar! Other sights and visits must include the Van Gogh museum and the Anne Frank House both of which you really must buy your ticket online before you go to bypass the mile-long queues of day-trippers. The Rijksmuseum was a little disappointing for me as it's mostly closed off for renovations. I did get to see Rembrant's Night Watch though which may or may not be worth the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11 entrance fee. All depends on how much art you like. The Hansel & Gretel cafe across from the Rijksmuseum is a nice stop for lunch. The red-light district is worth a walk through. We walked through it around 4pm so it wasn't that intimidating, and although we did see drug dealers and prostitutes about, we didn't get propositioned for either services. I guess you have to visit the area as it's part of the city. If neither drugs or prostitution interests you (certainly not us!) it's not worth spending any length of time here. They do have some good fast food places though (for the munchies probably!) There's also a couple of well-placed(!) old churches in this district which are worth a visit. If you need the use of a public toilet in the city, there are very few. The best bet is to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac0.50 in McDonalds or any bar or restaurant. It seems this is normal for the Netherlands. Don't bother paying the extortionate \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.50 an hour internet rate in the hotel, use the internet cafe on Overtoom (opp Dutch Bikes) for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.25 per 1/2 hour. The courtyard garden of the hotel is a nice place to sit out, even if it's raining and cold, underneath the awning with the heaters on it's better than staying in the room. The TV is not worth a mention really. BBC1 Northern Ireland, CNN and Eurosport are the only english channels. Didn't want to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.50 a day for 'other' channels. On a strange note - take mosquito repellant with you. Our room had quite a few. We were unprepared and paid the price getting quite a lot of bites. Must have been the time of year? Worth a train trip to Den Haag to visit Madurodam (minature village) and Delft (pottery and lovely old town). If I had to mention any negatives, the guests walking and talking loudly past our door at 1.30am & 4.30am on a Friday morning were extremely rude and inconsiderate and you can hear anyone coming up or going down the old wooden stairs at all times of day or night. Thicker carpet is needed. The mosquitos were quite annoying but I can't blame the hotel. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay more than 3 nights in Amsterdam to cut the ever-increasing costs in a safe and comfortable environment. Make good use of the discount cards in the reception and the bowl of strong mints! Thankyou to Ben (night porter) who kept me in good measures of Johnny Walker and Heineken. You are indeed a gentleman. Thankyou to the kind and hospitable day staff. Very friendly and most helpful with our week's stay in Amsterdam. We'll be back.

On the day I arrived I was allowed to check in immediately (at 9 in the morning). The elevator was barely big enough for me to squeeze in with my bag, but manageable. I found the floors and corridors of the hotel to be quite a maze though that wasn't too much of a problem either. The main problem was the room. I had a booked a double room for one night, and a triple for two. The double room i was given, had the not so picturesque view of another double room with the windows of the two rooms barely two inches apart. The lack of ventilation caused by this coupled with the lack of air conditioning made this room absolutely inhabitable (at least for me, considering it was end june and i had met a particularly hot weekend).

We had requested a double room but on arrival we had in fact been allocated a twin room, which in hindsight was probably better given the room size, also it was at the back of the hotel facing the garden which was nice and quite apart from the noise of fireworks going off . The room itself was on the 3rd floor and if we used the lift ( which states it can take 4 people or 300kg ~ 2 people is about right ) we then had to climb down some steepish stairs to reach our room. The room itself was okay in size, the twin beds butted together , dressing table, bedside tables, 2 chairs, table and a tv ( Only CNN was in English~ extra channels at a cost) . The bathroom was on the small size, but stylish, completely tiled , and had an enclosed shower. The room was fresh and clean, the beds were comfy and fresh clean sheets and fresh towels were supplied every day, including New Years Day although i,m not sure if the rooms were cleaned. My only complaint regarding the room is that we requested extra pillows after the first night (only 1 soft pillow is allocated to each bed) only to be told that the hotel is fully booked and there is no spare pillows, we asked again every other day only to be given the same answer, i thought a hotel this size would have extra linen, pillows etc available. The Reception was open 24hrs and we found the staff to busy doing reception and other duties to be friendly,chatty but in saying that they were very helpful when asked( Except if you'e asking for pillows) . The night receptionist got to know you and had your key available for you without asking for it .The bar was next to the reception area and was covered by whoever was on reception duty, it was small, reasonable priced, just ideal for that nightcap. Breakfast was typically continental with assorted cereals, fresh breads, ham, cheese, jams etc... orange juice and hot drinks, although for some reason the tea was warm rather than hot and that was without the milk being added,and on a couple of occasions we had to ask for the meat platter to be refilled. The location of the hotel was excellant, a No 1 Tram from Central Station stopped 50 yards from the hotel in the next street ( Cost 1.60 Euro).To Leidesplein square it was 5mins max as was the designer shops which is located in Hoofenstraft . the Van Gogh and the Riksmuseum are also 10 mins from the hotel and Dam Square 15 mins walking. The only downside regarding the Europa as like any other small Amsterdam hotels is that there not really disability friendly in the number of stairs encountered and access areas.

Also, I didn't like it when the maid came in while I was taking a nap, they should have a little sign that you can hang outside the door that lets them know you don't want to be disturbed. The rooms are very small and you can hear your neighbors talking through the walls. The room I got this time was facing the street and when I opened the window (it was stuffy in there) the noise was loud to the point of not being able to hear the TV. The good points are that they have a good breakfast and their location is great!!!!!

However, when you book that hotel make sure you take into account the following: The price posted on the net EXCLUDES 5% city tax 4% for credit card use 2.25\u00e2\u201a\u00ac/day for the key to the safe 9\u00e2\u201a\u00ac/day/person for breakfast. (Breakfast includes 3 different cereals, o-juice, fruits, cheese, rolls, sliced bread, different marmelades, etc.) So, in the end you might pay 100\u00e2\u201a\u00ac more than you thought you would. One more thing: Ask for a room facing the garden NOT the road. The road is way too busy.

We had room 23 which overlooked the courtyard so there was no traffic noise, it was very quiet for us except the odd selfish people that were noisy coming back to thier rooms The room had a double bed and a single in it. It only had a shower not a bath but that was adequate.Like previous comments the toilet could have done with some bleach. Breakfast was continental but I missed the luxury of toast. The staff were friendly and helpful when prompted. Locality was good, previously we had stayed at the Rho on Dam Square,on comparisson the positio of the Europa was better and for someone who gets lost chasing her own shadow I had no problem with the trams etc. and finding my way around.

Breakfast is what you expect in a european hotel, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, meats, bread, etc. The stairs leading up to the first floor are a little steep.

One of our stays was at Europa 92, Amsterdam for 2 nights 21st and 22nd June 2003 and have just arrived home from London. On our entire trip we kept all money on our persons. At Europa we used the safe to store our UK pounds. On arriving in London, I was UKP 60 short and my husband UKP 130 short. Whoever had access to our rooms and safe was clever enough to realise that by taking all the money, the alarm would be raised, but by just taking a portion would be unoticed! This matter will be taken up with the hotel but a positive result is not expected. Our travel insurers may also take a suspicious view but there you are.....people be alert! We are extremely careful people so this is a very large disappointment.
