The hotel is right on the metro station so thats great because you can go out in the evening to taxim without worrying about the traffic times. it has a nice spa/gym/pool also which appeared quite reasonable but i did not have the time to use the facilities. Breakfast was nice but quite predictable and they used to have the same menu ( more or less) , however they would make eggs cooked to order so i did fine. The bar is great for a evening drink and quite reasonably priced. In stanbul english is a bit of a problem as not many people know english properly so even when you go out you should know where you are going as difficult to communicate. Overall dont stay here if you want to be near the sights or entertainment as it is quite a dull hotel in the evening and nearby also i could not find any entertainment. Its near to Metrocity mall so thats one advantage. People talk about the noise from the main highway and i would say if you are on a higher floor then its not really bad.

The traffic is very busy during the rush hour every morning and evening, but if you are not afraid to travel by metro, you are at Taksim square in no time - there is a station right next to the hotel. Also right next to the hotel is the newly opened Sapphire Mall with many great stores. A little further is the Kanyon Shopping Mall which includes a big, modern cinema and then there is also the Mall Metrocity another 400m further. So even when you don't feel like sightseeing, you won't be bored. The staff was always smiling, friendly and helpful. Their friendliness really made my day. Also, we never had to wait anywhere, at the reception, in the restaurant or in the lounge. The view over the business district is great. You really feel that Istanbul is an unbelievably big city. Even though there is a major road next to the hotel, this didn't disturb me while sleeping. But maybe that was because the bed was so comfortable! Just like the armchair, my personal favorite. The bathroom was also nice and spacious, with lots of amenities and a cute yellow duck, apparently the special touch of every Moevenpick Hotel. The glass window between the room and bathroom was also a funny touch, but luckily we could close the blinds. It was always very clean and the towels were replaced every day. It is a shame if you have trouble eating in the morning, because the breakfast is very extensive and delicious. Either way, you will get your fair share of vitamins without any trouble. Fresh juices and different types of fruit are always ready - peeled and sliced. A great start of the day! On a less healthy note, I also really loved the chocolate fondue, only available in the winter time (until the end of February). This was definitely worth its price.

Food at the Moevenpick was all delicious, filling and high qulaity. The breakfast was to die for! With both Western and Turkish tastes catered for. We also had cake and coffee in the lobby, the coffee was great and the chocolate cake melted in the mount. We had room service too one night; it was quick, hot and really good. They even included a couple of complimentary desserts for us. The use of the leisure facilities was included: the swimming pool and jacuzzi were both lovely and very quiet. No screaming kids which was great for a couple's break. Best of all was the view, I think we were maybe on the 10th floor and we could see over the whole of Istanbul. Very romantic! another nice feature for couples is the glass window between the shower/bath and the bedroom. A fun feature and there was blind you could easily close if you preferred privacy. The only drawback was the expensive price of everything in the hotel, but that's what you expect from a 4/5* hotel.

When we did actually dine in the hotel the food was generally good, but again its that little attention to detail that for me lets this hotel down, for example if you order the mixed grill with a trio of sauces..don't forget the sauces pls and don't bring it out when you are reminded that you have forgotten the sauces near the end of the meal!!

The last five times I have chosen \"The M\u00c3\u00b6venpick\" for its outstanding excellence. The Hotel is fault free in my opinion. The fantastic breakfast. Tthe really good service; always with a smile. The clean spacious rooms with the great bathroo. The many facilities offered and the exceedingly helpful valet service. Not once had I noticed, any of the staff trying to get a tip or even waiting for one. I advice everyone to stay at this Real 5 stars Hotel, when they are in Istanbul. By the way, the Metro station Levent 4 is less than 5 minutes walk, and the frequent trains take you to Taksim in less than 15 minutes. I've been living in Sweden for more than 10 years and highly appreciate good living, and this hotel does it's best to offer that. The only negative things I can think of is the small TV, and the local area behind the hotel, and that adds a little colour to one's visit to this great city.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlisle, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAlmost - but only almost - perfect.\u201d", "Author": "Heavenl1y", "ReviewID": "UR17833088", "Content": "This hotel is fantastic. From the welcoming staff in immaculate uniforms, to the valet parking service, to the smart and clean rooms, to the key operated lift - everything was as you would expect from a 5* swiss chain. We were disappointed, though, to find that not everything was perfect. On our second day, the mini-bar was not refilled, and it took 2 requests to housekeeping before we were brought the wrong items: and a further 20 minutes to get the correct items. There is a pillow menu in the room, but having a different pillow delivered also took 2 requests and 24 hours wait. The restaurant food is superb, outstanding and reasonably priced. The service staff tend to be a little over-powering in their desire to please, but I'm not sure that's really a complaint! However, the weekend is quiet in the hotel, and with an empty restaurant the quality of service drops dramatically. It took 2.5 hours for a 2 course meal - which is stretching one's patience a little! Having said that, when we mentioned our concerns at check out, we were dealt with quickly and efficiently. We were invited to a conference with the duty manager, chef and F&B manager who listened with genuine concern. They were apologetic, friendly and seemed keen to know how they could improve. Unlike some hotels, I really felt that they would actually take notice. I didn't feel as if I was being 'fobbed off'! They also didn't offer discount on the bill which is so often the easy option in hotels of less quality. Overall, I'd recommend it. The location is great, and whilst it is expensive, it's worth the money. It's not perfect - but it's trying very hard to be.", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBad location for sightseeing\u201d", "Author": "adamandterri", "ReviewID": "UR17784204", "Content": "This Hotel is located in the financial district which is 20 minutes by metro to Taksim, the main shopping and sightseeing area.
