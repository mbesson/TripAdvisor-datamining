The area is horrible and we were harassed by beggars a couple of times walking from the tube to the hotel. We could deal with both these problems and they would not stop us booking again as the hotel is convenient for access to central London.

This is a shame as the hotel is good for the price. The rooms are small, but not too small, and they are comfortable with good complimentary refreshments, tea, coffee, biscuits etc. Didn't use the bar but it also looked nice.

However having had a comical stay, the least I can do is share with my fellow travellers. Stayed here in early December for 3 nights. Booked a Std Double room and upon arrival was handed the room key and pointed in the direction of the lift. Although we had 5 bags in total, there was no offer of help with the bags from the staff. Took the lift, went down a corridor and the end room was ours. Paid no attention to the little fridge lying in the corridor apart from having to manoeuver around it. Walked into the room and discovered a tiny room with a double bed. After we added our bags to the room, there was very little space left in the room. I could stand in the centre of the room and virtually touch either side wall. The TV was a small flatscreen fixed into the wall cabinet and facing the side wall which was at a full 90* angle to the bed. Thus if you wanted to watch TV, you had to draw the single room chair to the front door and sit there. Not sure where the 2nd person in the room would sit to watch TV ....however...On a good note, atleast the bathroom was clean ! Started to unpack and opened up the wardrobe to access the in-room safe. Followed the written instructions but to no avail. An in-room safe is a key criteria for us as we were on the go for all 3 days, thus rang reception and was advised to try {START} 8888 then {START} to open or reset the safe. Tried it but again no success. Rang Reception again and was advised that he would have a look. A few minutes later and the diagnosis was an in-operable in-room safe. We asked for an alternate room but was advised that being a Friday night, there were no other rooms available, but they would look at moving us the following day. Satisfied, we continued to unpack before I searched for the bar fridge. Not being in the room, I looked out the corridor and ascertained that the little fridge lying unplugged in the corridor was indeed our fridge. Rang reception again and asked about the room fridge - was informed immediately that unfortunately our room fridge was broken! The Receptionist excused himself and promised to ring back in a few minutes with a solution. A few minutes later and we were offered a new room on a different floor.... don't know how these rooms magically appear :) He came up to our room and offered us the new room key and then left...so we packed our bags again and hauled ourselves through the corridor, to the lift, up a floor, then through another corridor to find our new room. Wow, this room had a double bed and had more room to swing the cat. Not completely sure but could this have been the Executive room ! Possibly so. On a good note the TV in the wall cabinet, faced the bed, the bathroom was bigger and very clean. The in-room safe worked and so did the fridge. We followed the safe instructions and set our own safe code. Out of curiosity, after testing our own safe code, I tried the earlier combination given by the Receptionist and found that it worked as well. Anyone who knew that could open our safe whilst we were out sight seeing! Whats the point of an in-room safe, if you are given the master \"code\" for all safes at this hotel ! After our initial experience, we were hesitant to try any other facilities or services at this hotel, so cannot comment on anything apart from our room and experiences with Reception. The hotel is located within 300m from the tube station, and 100m from the Overground Station - thus in the right location. There is a Marriot hotel about 100m down the road and directly across from the Marriot is a lovely Persian restaurant with excellent food which we would happily recommend as well.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cRude staff make a bad hotel worse\u201d", "Author": "MiaMe", "ReviewID": "UR122414565", "Content": "We stayed here for 1 night on Boxing Day night and it was underwhelming.

We in general found the same experiences as just about everyone else who has reviewed the property in this forum - both good and bad - but what was unique about our experience was the entertainment of having the police called by Adil the 'owner' of the hotel to attempt to throw us out after my attempting to 'discuss' an incorrect bill. The hotel website <http://www.qualitymaitrise.com/index.html> clearly states that \"OUR VIP Room offer added benefits such as free daily passes to Bannantyne Health Club located three minutes walk from the hotel, cooked breakfast , chocolates on the pillow, complimentary still and sparkling water, and ELSYL range of toiletries and 15% discount at Rafkins.\" We never saw a single health club pass, and after providing over \u00a32500 of custom to the property over the period of 4 weeks, I was presented with a month-end bill for food at Raskins (it's hard to figure what to call it; it's not a restaurant, more like in in-house canteen) that included extra costs for cooked breakfasts that were supposed to be included with the VIP room rate, and nowhere was there evidence of having received the offered 15% discount for the various dinners and drinks. When I challenged this incorrect bill, the in-house staff were unable to do anything about it, and when I requested 'head office' to call me about it, I was rudely rebuffed by the company accountant who was the acting manager. Escalation to the 'Director' who was named Adil the owner resulted in his trying to apply an abusive ploy at intimidation and coercion with an attempt to turf my family out on the street with less than one hour notice. The local police were summoned by the Owner/Director to apply pressure for me to not only cave in to paying an extra \u00a390 for the incorrect breakfast charges and non-existent discount, but also to leave the hotel immediately with an ill son with fever. The Owner/Director was dismissive and non-responsive but finally we agreed to a settlement that included his voluntary inducement to \"write off\" the entire food bill, so that my family and I would leave the hotel immediately (instead of extending for several days to suit our travel plan). The police told me that the Owner/Director had complained that I was 'disturbing the peace' by seeking redress for the incorrect bill (despite my having taking no more threatening action than writing an e-mail). As soon as the police left the building, the Owner/Director went back on his word and undertaking with the police and not only charged the full food bill without corrrection or discount, but did so without first providing me with a final bill or opportunity to review and approve the charges to the charge card on file. The police were very heavy handed in trying to force me to submit to the Owner's administrative abuse and when I called back to enquire about the broken agreement in front of them only just moments before, I was told that there is nothing they can do, and that I can reference the file number in going to small claims court (as if I've got time for that on a limited time trip from America!). The general staff were trying to do the right thing, but the management of the hotel not only provided no customer service atttitude, but also went back on a verbal agreement in front of police. I had to endure another police visit that evening to assure my family's ability to stay an extra night to allow my son to recover his health and us to find another more hospitable property. Bottom line is that stay if you want but get everything explicitly in writing and do not trust anything that management say to you; also check your bill very carefully before you leave, my bill had a spurious charge of \u00a3297 plus the incorrectly applied cooked breakfast charges. Do not expect an ounce of customer service attitude from management and don't bother paying \u00a34.75 for Soup of the Day it's likely to be from a can probably from Tesco across the street despite being described on the menu as being 'freshly prepared in-house'. And the \"bar\" in Rafkins hasn't had working beer taps for months so hope you like bottled beer (you'll have to ask for a glass to drink it).

However, on our first night the hotel was incredibly hot, air conditioning did little to temper the heat (and we were staying on the first weekend in November) and when I suggested tot he receptionist the following morning that the heating was too high it took a while for her to take on board my feedback, instead suggesting that I didn't know how to use the air conditioning (all of our group were wilting overnight!). Anyhow, when we returned later that day the heating had been adjusted to a much more suitable temperature. The hotel has a bar but it closes at 11pm. Kind of pointless?? The breakfast offering was fine, though by Sunday the small pastries were stale (lord knows how long they'd been there, judging by the taste and feel of them... days). The service at breakfast on Saturday was appalling. After waiting for 15 minutes for the waiter to take our breakfast order, hubby went to the kitchen to ask if he could order only to be told that he'd be right over. When he came tot he table it transpired the waiter didn't speak English (we wanted a full english with poached eggs) and so our order arrived (incorrectly) after a further 20 minutes. So, having sent that back we finally got our breakfast order almost an hour after we went down to breakfast!! Sunday's service was much better so maybe this was a one off? Whilst the decor of the hotel is lovely, there are some details that are overlooked. The tap in our room was falling off, the room was dusty and bags of rubbish were left in the corridoors. I'm tempted to say the hotel is \"all fur coat and no knickers\" but it's not quite that bad. However, my advice would be to make sure the details don't let down the gloss and glamour that is the first impression.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood location, very good design\u201d", "Author": "NNaaZZ", "ReviewID": "UR120168392", "Content": "Stayed 2 days, everything was ok.

It's therefore a nice place for tourists. However, you should be warned that the hotel has cut every single corner to keep the rate this low. Our room had no window, which meant no natural sunlight right in the middle of July. The air condition worked alright though. The finish of the room was very cheap, lacking a tile in the bathroom, stained carpet, scratched wooden furniture. The breakfast was typically industria\u00e6 products i.e. Toast, prepackaged cheese, jam and butter, and Nescafe that was alternately bitter or tasteless. The staff seemed utterly inexperienced or careless, basically shrugging their shoulders if something was wrong. The restaurant served us fish and chips which was frozen in the middle of the fish. The staff sent mixed messaged about what we had payed for and what we hadn't, making us worrry if we were being scammed. All these small things added up and made it a bit stressfull to stay at the hotel. Of course, it's perfectly respectable to provide a very cheap hotel experience because of low expenditures, but you as a tourist have to be honest with yourself and ask if it wouldn't be better to spend 20-40 pounds extra per night to get a way better hotel, or to move a bit outside the center of London (ie The Hide or a Premier Inn).

It was snowing outside and we both felt really sorry for the girl on reception as she must have been freezing, every time the front doors opened there was an icy blast that blew all her papers everywhere! The hotel itself looks amazing! Ultra modern and very very stylish! Our room was very nice, the bed was a little hard and there was a large pane of glass leaning on the wall at one side of the bed, when we drew back the curtains we realised this was the secondary double glazing and as it was freezing outside we decided to replace it ourselves! The room itself was not very big, it was a struggle for both of us to walk round the bottom of the bed at the same time. The mattress was also quite hard. Ans there was a long blonde hair on the bedside table! Eww! We went downstairs to Rafkins Bar and Restaurant after seeing what they had to offer on an advert in the lift and on leaflets left out on our bed. The restaurant serves until 10.30 and has a good selection of drinks. However not much of the food advertised in the room or in the lift were on the actual restaurant menu which we found a bit strange. It was a bit of a struggle ordering as the staff did not speak fantastic English, a couple on the next table ordered a Corona and ended up with a Coke and I ordered Sherry Trifle and ended up with Apple and Raspberry crumble (this wasn't even mentioned on the menu so I have no idea where it came from!!!!). The food we ordered was very good though. We got back to our room and this was the first time we had taken our shoes off. We realised that there were big soggy patches on the carpet, it definitely wasn't from our shoes and was very wet to walk on. At this point it was around midnight so we decided to leave the matter and mention it on check out. The room we were in (301) was very noisy. It was right next to the lift and where the maid trolley was kept so you could hear people walking past all night and then the maids chatting about uniforms in the morning. You could also hear noise from upstairs and every hour or so we were woken through out the night by a loud clicking and squeaking noise which we assumed was the heating. Amazingly though, there was no noise from Kilburn High Road. The only saving grace was the shower. It was amazing even if the door was broken and sprayed water all over the bathroom floor. When we were about to check out there was a knock on the door, even though we had the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door. It was a random man with a key card in his hand. He wasn't wearing a uniform but said he had to fit the pane of glass in the room for us and it would only take a minute. I explained that we had already done it ourselves and he scuttled off, key in hand! When we checked out we weren't even asked if we had had a good stay, the girl on reception was probably too cold to think about asking! So I mentioned that the carpet was soaking wet in the room.

On my last night when I arrived back at the hotel with a friend who was staying with me in my double room the last night, the room hadn't been cleaned, and when I asked reception they said they would make sure it was cleaned the next day. I informed them that I was checking out the next day, and requested new towels as the ones in the room had been used. I was told I could not have them until housekeeping got there the next morning, and only got them after asking repeatedly. The hotel also don't have a luggage room where items could be left during the day, and as my flight was not until late monday, on my departure day we had to leave the luggage in the reception room. There were bags and suitcases everywhere, it looked messy, and didn't feel safe, anyone could have walked in taken them. The hotel is lovely and new, but the service was awful. Hopefully the hotel will sort out these problems in the future, but I won't be staying again.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSTUNNING BEAUTIFULL EXTRAVAGANT HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "sherisex", "ReviewID": "UR82203026", "Content": "would just like to say cannot believe the bad reviews about this hotel. when i stayed there with my bf last november i was totally amazed i thought it was absolutley beautifull. no money spared on this hotel. done to a very high specification . i would stay here again and i recomend it to any1 i know travelling to london. beautifull 10 out of 10 for me xxx", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "kr.sand", "Title": "\u201cLooks good on the outside but....TERRIBLE on the inside...\u201d", "Author": "alexKr_sand", "ReviewID": "UR81868926", "Content": "We booked 2 rooms for 6 days stay in july.

The hotel was in a great location, a couple of minutes from the tube and every shop you could need just outside your door. To be honest, everything was great. From how the rooms were decorated to the nuclear powered shower. But its hard to appreciate these things when you're too hot to breath. From the pictures on their website and booking.com you'd be fooled into assuming that these rooms had windows. Functioning windows, that open and everything. But you'd be wrong. My sister's room had a fake window comprising of a plastic frame and a material resembling cling film. Although this could've been a mirage due to the stifling heat. The air con was hardly an improvement, in the end we resorted to blowing on eachother to keep us from going into anaphylactic shock. When it came to sleeping the covers became the enemy. Lying on top of the bed, keeping perfectly still seemed to be the only way to stay relatively comfortable. Although that didn't seem to help my boyfriend who spend the evening chucking up his tapas in the bathroom. You don't realise how much you miss fresh air and natural light until you're stuck in the Quality Maitrise.

After a night out we decided to order some sandwiches from the bar/restaurant but were told they didnt do sandwiches. We explained that we were residents and would like the sandwiches from the room service menu and we would have them in our room but were told that the kitchens closed at 9pm so we couldnt have room service. Very odd considereing that there are menus for 24 hr room service in the rooms. If you have ordered full English breakfast beware it is not English in the sense you would probably expect. When ours was served the beans were cold, sausage tasted of nothing and the bacon had never seen a pig. I asked the waiter what it was and he said it was turkey. When I asked why it was advertised as English breakfast he apologised and said it was a Halal restaurant therefore the breakfast was halal. THEY SHOULD ADVERTISE THE FACT THAT IT IS A FULL HALAL BREAKFAST. The waiter said that the pirce of the breakfast would be deducted from the final bill but it wasnt.

I was upset, but figured it was a new hotel, and they just did not have the space for a bag check\u2026 I was so tired\u2026Oh well..moving on\u2026. \u2022The bed was terrible.. the site boast about orthopedic mattresses after my stay there, I need to see a orthopedist! \u2022The shower was awesome. \u2022My bathroom sink was dirty, but I carry disinfectant wipes with me, and sorted it myself! GLOB of dried toothpaste on the outside of the bowl, and nastiness on the inside. \u2022The shower was awesome. \u2022The room was tiny, but good for one or two.. \u2022No internet access for 1.5 days. ( I was there for business, so that was hard to deal with Thank god for Starbucks! ) \u2022No hot breakfast the oven and stove were broken for the first morning. \u2022The shower was awesome. \u2022Restaurant seemed like it was a chore for them to cook for you, I only ate there mid day, and each time I tried, It was painful. \u2022Reception needs to hop on the bus, and go up and down the high road to know what is in the neighborhood. That should be implemented as week one job training. I know that street better than the front desk employees. And I am from New York!!! I asked where I could get some items printed for our presentation- they sent me to a internet caf\u00e9, about 3-4 blocks up the high street.. just in case you need one, there is a excellent print shop less then a block from them (go out the door and to your right)! \u2022Only one person I dealt with at the hotel had a clue. That was the lady who checked me out of the hotel. They guy who checked me in was RUDE! And the girl at night, although pretty, was just pretty..she did not know anything when I asked, how you get here, or there. On the check out day\u2026.My flight did not leave until much later in the evening I asked them to hold my bags, you would not believe that the girl who checked me out of the hotel, asked me to follow her. She UNLOCKED a door, and told me to put my bags in the storage closet. So there is storage. HOLY STORAGE! I will never stay there again, if I can help it! Mainly because the beds were bad for my back. Lazy employees you get everywhere, people sometimes miss things when they clean, human error.. internet goes down every now and again, and stoves don\u2019t work at times. Stuff happens\u2026 but between the beds, and the lack of good customer service, Id rather not return. They need to reinforce the value of customer service. Listen if I had a bad bed, but everything else was near perfect, I would totally recommend the place. They do a good burger and chips and the place is decorated nicely. Unfortunately there was not one point that made this stay worth it.. with the exception of the awesome shower", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, UK", "Title": "\u201cBeware of them overbooking and transferring you to Wembley!

They told us they had a room at their sister hotel in Wembley 2 tube stations away (it was 6 and meant extra exspense, it was in zone 4!). The hotel was horrible and toilet seat was not cleaned, staff were terrible! It was a 30 minute taxi ride from Maitrise. They arranged a taxi to Wembley and back again so I could make my way into Central London. I was told I could have a taxi back to Wembley at the end of my night. WRONG! They left me in the pouring rain to make my way back to Wembley. I had to liaise with the taxi company myself, who went out of their way to collect me (after standing in rain for 50 mins). The taxi company could clearly see the poor attitude of the management at this hotel as they actually lied to me about the return tax, the driver felt sorry for me! Mr Ali Imran (so called Manager) be ashamed of yourself! We met an Austrian couple who was in the same predicament, not a good impression to make on foreign visitors to England!! If you are booking to stay at this hotel don't! If you must, check that your reservation is confirmed and pray that you get what you want because Mr Imran and Mr Lopez will not go out of their way for you or provide good, decent customer service!

I went there based on the reviews of this site, so I felt confident that I was getting a good deal. I was right. The rooms are cozy and modern.

And, I wouldn't want to use the toilet if I were over 6'3\" or 225 pounds. But, for us average-sized people, it's a cozy place to hang out and hang your head. It's probably most appropriate as a nice base for going out on the town and needing a comfy bed and modern amenities. Although, my girlfriend did not like their shampoo and the bathroom soap can dry your face. Not to worry though b/c there's a Tesco's across the street. Their restaurant, Rafkins, have good service, although it took 15 minutes to get my breakfast sandwich out of the kitchen.You may need to order some food b/c the continental breakfast is on the light side.

The room itself was very clean and neat but VERY VERY small. I don't know what was so 'executive' about it, but I dread to think of how big a standard room is. The bathroom was again tiny, but had everything you needed, however we were very disappointed that the heated towel rail didn't work. I had quite possibly the worst night's sleep ever, even after consuming a botel of wine! The room was absolutely BOILING! I think we were next to the boiler for the whole hotel because it was also extremely noisy. The bed was not a standard double, it was more like a large single, and it was very hard.
