We opted to pay a bit more (and were lucky enough to have an upgrade too) to one of the newly refurbished rooms on the first floor. It was very comfortable and spacious and the bathroom was a really good size too. The breakfast was good - basic continental, but there was everything you could have wanted. The staff were great - really helpful and welcoming. Location is superb - easy access to transport to and from the airport, close to the tourist buses, handy for the beaches and right in the centre of everything. As the hotel is currently being refurbished there was sometimes a bit of noise from the builders during the day and a lot of half-finished works but nothing too intrusive, but if our room was anything to go by then it should be fab when it's finished. The real bonuses for us were free internet use, free safety deposit boxes, being able to leave all our bags for free after we'd checked out and being able to sit on the balconies watching all the action in La Rambla.

It turned out that the hotel is in a process of renovation and probably will have a changed number of stars soon. Our room was already renovated and quite pleasant. From the width of the doors and of the bathroom I guess it was designed to be wheel-chair accessible. A new elevator will be functioning from March 2012 so all of the comments regading the hotel being not accessible for people with walking difficulties will be iirelevant. Our room overlooked a courtyard so I can't say how noisy the rooms overlooking La Rambla are. On the other hand I would bear some noise in return to the view over the most famous street in Barcelona. The only thing missing in the room was a minibar but that was not a problem from our point of view. The location of the hotel is really great. It's right next to Catalunya Square where the bus from the airport stops. It's near the Tourist Buses' Stop and it's within a walking distance to a lot of sights and to a lot of good places to eat (not on La Rambla, you'd better skip those). It's also very close to La Boqueria market - a must-visit in Barcelona. The price included a breakfast which was good enough. The only problem was that the breakfast room tended to get full at certain hours and you might have to wait a little for a table. The people at the reception were all very kind and helpful.

Placa Catalunya is right outside your door, which is fantastic, and all of Barcelona's best shopping is right around the corner. The metro is at your door as well with it being at P. Catalunya. The hotel is clean and functional, making it a perfect place for those just looking for an inexpensive place to sleep. They are in the process of putting in a new elevator that will serve the entirety of the hotel. The desk staff were very friendly and efficient. Because of it's proximity to P. Catalunya, it is easily accesible from the airport via the Aerobus, which only costs 5 euro 30, which is way cheaper than a taxi or AeroCity. As much as the hotel was functional and in a superb location, my stay was sort of offset by the fact that the noise from the street was horrible...perhaps because I checked in on a Saturday, the night noise was elevated...however it was easily the most noise I've ever experienced in a hotel. I did notice that in my particular room the balcony door didn't seal properly and there were 2 cracks in the bottom that were wide enough that a bit of air flowed in, so these two minor deficiencies probably didn't help in keeping the noise out. But overall, I think the windows/doors desperately need to be replaced because there is so much noise, given it's the busiest street in Barcelona. I've read reviews of this hotel where some have said the noise was unbearable and some have said it was fine, so maybe it depends on the room you get. All I know is that I had to have my iPod on all night to drown out the noise. All in all, if you're willing to put up with night time noise from the streets to have a cheap bed in a great location, this hotel is for you.

It\u00b4s about 300 meters from the central Placa de Catalunya, with all the related metro stations, airport bus stop and prime real estate of the Passeig de Gracia (Gaudi buildings) . But the real attractioon here is the Ramblas....probable the best strolling & people watching boulevard in Europe (ending at the sea and continuing on to the fantastic Barcelona acquarium.

The first room had a dirty bathroom with flies, and I was up until4 AM due to the noise outside because Barca had lost (lucky for me).

I was told someone would come the next day, but that I could use a desk in the hallway behind the kitchen for the wifi. I sat there and used VOIP to communicate with work. As I was sitting there on an important call, the same person who told me I could sit there since my room did not have wifi walked by with a couple of men to show them one of the other supposedly superior rooms and started yelling at me in Spanish (I am bilingual) that they could not have a woman sitting in the common area speaking with such force. I had to interrupt my call to tell him that I was on the phone and had no choice but to sit there because they did not give me a room for wifi, which was guaranteed. Later, he decided to call my room to apologize and said he would have someone come to fix the wifi first thing in the morning (btw, wifi is pronouced weefee there). I told him they just needed a second router for that side of the building (if my husband had been there he could have fixed it in 5 minutes). The next morning I spoke with the front desk about the wifi and was told no one was coming or had been requested to come because it was good Friday, so the guy had lied to me to boot. Plus, I was thoroughly exhausted because the superior room was tucked on the main floor behind the breakfast room and kitchen, so the clanking of plates and glasses began around 6 AM, while the revelry outside on the ramblas quieted around 4.

Hotel Lloret was such a great little hotel and suited our needs to a T. The hotel itself has got the most perfect location, everything to visit Barcelona is on your doorstep. The tour buses, the Metro station, the aerobus just over the road and of course, La Rambla! The famous street itself has countless restaurants, cafes and bars and is great to just have a stroll. The hotel is very very clean and well kept. The rooms are more than adequate. We had a bath as well as a shower which is great after a long day of walking. The TV had more than 50 channels, a couple of which in English. Our room was 211 and had a side view of La Rambla, which did affect our quality of sleep but we simply appreciated our location and bought earplugs! On any hotel on La Rambla, you would make use of earplugs. Another little issue we had was the heating. We couldn't turn the radiator off which made the room very hot. The Spanish must think 15-16 degrees winter is freezing cold, whereas us Scots.. it doesn't get much hotter in the summer! It wasn't a giant problem for us just a little annoying. The breakfast consisted of yoghurt, cereal, tea, coffee, orange juice, breakfast muffins, croissants, fruit, etc.. which was nice as you look forward to a big lunch & dinner. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and eager to fulfill your needs. I 100% recommend this hotel. Its such a great little place to use as your base for visiting this beautiful city. Overall we loved it and would happily stay here if visiting Barcelona in the future. I also recommend the Barcelona bus tour, we did the blue tour (City Sightseeing Company) which took us round the Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. Also a trip to La Boqueria market is a must! It is well known that La Ramblas, especially, has more than its fair share of pick-pockets. Fortunately, we were not targetted which I imagine was helped by being very aware of everyone around us.

There is no getting around that point. My wife and I were travelling with our 17 year old (6'4\" tall) son. Our room was a triple consisting of a double bed and a single bed. This did not leave much room for anything else in the room. Storage consisted of a small exposed rack and nothing else. Actually, this didn't present a huge problem as the airline lost our luggage so we had nothing really to store for most of the time we were there! Our room did not face a street, but was a little noisy from other guests coming and going. All of that said, the room was spotlessly clean as was the bedding and bathroom. The window we had opened and so we are able to get fresh air into the room, which is always a plus. The front desk staff were excellent, always approachable and helpful with advice and information (very handy when you have no luggage and need to shop urgently!) The HUGE plus for this hotel is the location. When they say it's on Las Ramblas, they mean it's ON it! It is at the top end of Las Ramblas and only a very short walk from the aerobus (airport bus) stop in Plaza de Catalunya. If you are into the hop-on hop-off tourist bus systems, both major companies have their main terminal even closer to the hotel, also in Plaza de Catalunya. Just in behind the hotel is a maze of twisting small alleys and streets filled with reasonably priced tapas bars and cafes.

I had room 107 which had some full length windows which opened out to a very small balcony overlooking the Ramblas - couldn't get a better location. The hotel itself is perfectly fine and it was very clean. To reach reception you do have to go up a fligh of very narrow stairs so, with no lift, it can be a struggle for those with heavy bags or mobility problems. The guys behind the desk were efficient, without being over-friendly and when I had my wallet stolen (the pickpockets are rife and very clever) they gave me information about police stations, where I could get money transferred as well as general information about the city. My room was very small with limited storage space but it was clean. The bathromm was very clean and the shower was good with plenty of hot water. There was a TV in the room but with no English channels. The breakfast was quite disappointing with just some cereal, pots of yoghurt, bread and criossants with packs of butter and jam. The coffee was dispensed from a machine and was OK but not the best I have had. There was free internet access and there are 2 vending machines where you can gets cans of drink, sandwiches and bars of chocolate etc.. Overall the hotel is pretty good and as a single guy I would have no hesitation in going back - especially at 45 euros a night, given it's location. Tip: Please beware of the pickpockets. I spent most of the time walking round with my hands in my pocket but last Saturday night, around the Placa de George Orwell area, I was distracted by 2 guys, for no more than 10 seconds and they were off, with my wallet. 1 guy pretended to bump into me and when I went to push him away another guy puts a leaflet in your hand, advertising a bogus dancing bar. The few seconds you are off guard is all they need and they disappeared down an unlit side street so I thought better of chasing them. If you have not been to Barcelona before then I will not lie and say that pickpockets are rare because it is a problem but I would still advise you to go as it is a fantastic city.

The St. Joseph Market, just south of the hotel, was one of the best markets we saw in all of Europe. We even ate breakfast there.

The room was very well cleaned and tidied every morning, and although the rooms are basic we were a bit disappointed that there was no drawer space to put clothes and we had to stow our suitcases under the beds. Breakfast costs 5euro each but we did not try it because we always prefer to go to a patisseria and get fresh croissants which we take to a cafe to have with coffee. However the breakfast room always seemed very, very busy between 8am and 8.30. The lounge areas are small, but there is internet access, a large television, drinks machine and they have small tables and chairs out on the balconies, fantastic for sitting in the evening watching the hundreds of people walking up and down La Rambla, and we saw many entertainers right in front of us. The staff were happy to give us 2 glasses so we could have some wine while we sat on the balcony. The whole hotel has an 'old world' feel about it and the corridors and staircases in particular are very narrow (2 people cannot pass each other on the stairs to the rooms) and I would not recommend this hotel for families with very young children.

I am not saying that this is a horrible hotel by ay stretch of the imagination - but it is more of a hostel than hotel. Location: The location is absolutely fantastic. On La Ramblas, about 100 metres from Plaza de Catalonia - standing on your mini-balcony, you see all the life of this beautiful city below you. You hear the life of the city too - all the time. Still, staying in Spain - one needs to hear the noises to really soak up the life. Hearing a group of revellers at 3am on a week night reminds you that you are in a city that doesn't sleep and to live life to the fullest :) The room I was given was a triangle. I don't know if this is regular - but there were only three walls - with a door in one leading to the bathroom. The bathroom was no bigger than a double shower and contained a shower, toilet and vanity unit. At least once a day the electricity would go off from the water in the bathroom splashing onto the light globe above the sink. The concierge seemed used to this too. I got quite attached to our daily chat while he played with the fuse box and caught up on global news events. Your experience in a hotel like this isn't complete unless there are some faulty-towers moments. My only main disappointment was that none of the staff were called Manuel - but of course this being Catalunya, they were all called Jordi. Even the girls! :) The bedroom contained a single bed, and left enough room for my suitcase to sit on its side. I could, when lying on the bed flush against one wall, touch the other wall and the door. In my university days this would have been a god-send, but my flexibility and libido don't require such dimensions anymore so was a bit annoying and often made you feel claustrophobic when you wake suddenly in the night. The TV was on a bracket near the ceiling. There physically would have been no room for it on the floor. Not only could you not swing a cat in this room (first time I literally understood that saying) you could not spread your arms out at your side and spin - and a holiday isn't just a holiday unless you do some helicopter spins in your room in the morning! Considering that Barcelona is a city that doesn't sleep, and one spends more time in the tavernas and shops than they do in their rooms, it is really only a place to sleep, and hence not that bad. I personally like a bit of luxury and realised with a sudden shock when I entered the room that being frugal and thinking 'I could handle a cheaper place for a couple of days' was not so true. Next time its the Sofitel. Definitely not a place for couples or families - maybe only the budget conscious solo traveller would like this place. The breakfast was a watered-down version of the typical Spanish spread. Coffee only came from a self-service machine and the day-old bread was often 2 or 3 day old bread as the same baguette was on the table everyday. Still with numerous eateries in the area, this wasn't an issue at all. If you want to stay at this hotel - prepare yourself for a very small and no-frills experience. Do not expect a 5 star experience and remember you could not be more central in Barcelona if you tried. Focussing on its wondeful locale reminds you that it is not that big a deal.

The positives: - The staff was really helpful, polite and were doing everything they can do to make your stay better. - They have a luggage room that you can leave your luggages until you check in. - The small living room with a fireplace and a pc was really cute. Many newspapers were available to read. A tv room was also there with a huge vending machine with all sort of foods and drinks (I don't know about the prices, I didn't use it). - The location as I said. Cloce to metro & bus station, shops, Burger King, Mc Donalds, super market, Hard Rock Cafe etc - The room was very clean. The negatives: - The room was really small with very old furniture and an ancient air condition system (even though I admit it was working like it was new). The room has nothing to do with the pictures on the hotel's internet site!!!!! - It was a little noisy but not too much (we had a room looking on the side street). That was all. In general it was a clean hotel that if you get it in good price and just use it only to sleep go for it. PS At the entrance of the hotel there are some stairs, so if you are using a wheelchair avoid it. PS 2 For some other advices I found helpful Rachie_babez 's review.

We shall definitely be returning! :-) We had 4 nights in hotel lloret in a triple room..admittidly it was a small room but it had 3 comfy beds, a nice power shower and air conditioning!! [ which was at no extra cost ] The majority of the staff speak good english and will be more than happy to help if you don't know the area very well or just want advice on good/reasonable restaurants. [TIP- bars and restaurants off la rambla are much cheaper and often nicer than ones directly on la rambla.] Being teenage girls well lets just say our room became instantly messy within 5 minutes off arriving.! The cleaners even folded our pyjama's up and put them under our pillows everyday! As well as replacing towels and thoroughly cleaning the bathroom and room.! The service hotel lloret provided far exceeded 2 star rating! Some general info about la rambla area of barcelona...if you are young and don't have the money or don't want to dine in restaurants there are plenty of supermarkets to buy ready made pastas/sandwiches and bageuttes. However if there is also a Subway, KFC, Macdonalds, Burger King along la Rambla. So your taste buds will be satisfied [sort of] as long as your'e not there for more than a week!! Admittedly we did dine on subways and the occasional KFC, however the 30 minute walk 4 times a day to port olympic and back solved the issue of piling on the pounds.!! The closest beach is barceloneta and is about a 30 minute walk straight down la rambla and left at the harbour..! [We refused to pay for taxis] The best clubs are at port olympic and most are free to get into just get talking to the right people :-) they chuck out mon-fri no later than 4am... BAD THINGS ABOUT THE HOTEL / HOLIDAY / BARCELONA 1] The hotel room had just one plug in the bathroom and one which the TV was plugged into..this was not helpful with 3 teenage girls getting ready to go out each night..!! 2] The taxi drivers WILL pile on extras for transfers to and from the airport..it should cost no more than 25euros as its only 20 minutes max away. We paid 35 on the way and just 25 on the way back...we agreed on a price with the driver before getting in on the way back!! You REALLY need to do this to avoid them conning you.! 3] Watch out for drug dealers / theives / protitutes there are LOADS up la rambla after about 1am. And it was a horrible experience having to dodge them on our way back every night. Some friends we made got totally mugged credit cards, money, watch the lot..and this is a common occurance. So BE CAREFUL! 4] As barcelona is a city expect to pay more for everything. Although soveniers are cheap. Drinks at clubs were a RIP OFF!! 30 euros for 3 vodka and oranges.!! Although some clubs were cheap - going down to around 24 euros... Despite this we all had a fantastic time and we really want to return to barcelona and maybe do a bit more sight seeing and shopping this time rather than just beach/clubbing..!!!

The rooms were small and basic but the price was right. It was clean and safe while with a staff that was polite and helpful. You can't beat the location on La Rambla next to the Metro, bus to the airport and tour buses. The hotel also has an elevator and air conditioning which is something to consider in the summer. Also, the front desk can communicate in basic english which helped those of us who didn't speak much spanish. One note of caution - if you get a room on the front side, you may get some noise on popular nights. My sister and husband were on the front side the night of the World Cup finals and didn't get to sleep until after 2PM. Most of us requested a back side room and didn't have any problems. PS Mind your wallet and passports in BCN. My brother in law had his back back stolen at a street side bar in a scam where he was distracted by one while the other stole the back pack. He had to get a new passport at the American Consolate and said the place was packed with Americans with similar stories.", "Date": "July 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "cambridge, england", "Title": "\u201cAs expected\u201d", "Author": "Carolyn73", "ReviewID": "UR5383375", "Content": "Well, after reading the reviews before booking we packed ear plugs, and needed the them!!

Believe me, we were not expecting a luxury hotel, but this was just too small a room. We will stay in the Old City Center (Barri Gotic) area the next time.

Hotel easy to find when airport bus terminates at the Placa de Catalunya. Good value for money. Don't expect a 4 star, red carpet hotel. You don't spend much time in the room so enjoy the atmosphere and get good value for money.
