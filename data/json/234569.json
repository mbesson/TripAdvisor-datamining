We booked this hotel simply because of it's location and the fact that it was graded as 4 star - this is the last time I book using the stars as an indication of hotel quality and without reading reviews. The hotel is needing refurbished but this we could live with. The rain started on the day we arrived so the room was cold and damp. I attempted to turn the heating on but couldn't get it to work. I spoke to the man at reception who barely acknowledged that I was there and told me the heating had been switched off as it was hot enough - honestly!! I thought that it was up to me to control my room temperature but not at this hotel. By day 2 of the rain, the room was really cold and damp, not helped by the fact that the bathroom fan didn't work and we had to use the hairdryer to de-mist the mirror and to help dry our clothes and shoes. The bedding was beginning to feel damp by now however the extra blanket in the wardrope was dirty with staining and the top cover on our bed had holes in it. It was no better than a hostel and 2stars would be pushing it. We chose not to complain further as it was clear the staff were there to take our money and hand over the key and service was not part of their job. We would have moved hotel except we had booked through bookng.com and would not get a refund. The windows were not sound proofed which made sleeping really difficult with the noise of constant traffic and people shouting and bawling all night. The walls are paper thin aswell and the people in the room next to us leaving at 5.30am was a new experience altogether for us. After having stayed 4 days at the AXEL in Barcelona which was superb then moving to this place which really was the pits, it was a real let down. The disappointment in not getting home was bad enough but this made everything worse and has really tainted my memories of Barcelona. I have certainly learned my lesson and will NEVER book another place without first referring to reviews.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "RosannaCoates", "ReviewID": "UR127130062", "Content": "My husband and I also stayed 23rd to 26th March 2012.

This was really by default, as the hotel Rialto with whom I had been booked had a problem of some form or other and we got moved at the last minute. I checked tripadvisor regarding the Barcino, to be frankly horrified at the adverse reviews displayed. Frankly it made Faulty Towers seem like the Ritz and I attempted to get my party moved but due to time constraints found it impossible. My group arrived at the hotel with much trepidation having read reviews that spoke of a \"Run down and filthy hotel, badly designed and pretentious\", a hotel with bedroom doors that had no working locks. There were others that identified rude and unhelpful staff and inedible breakfasts. There were several that implored us to avoid the hotel at all costs, including one idiot that told the world at large he/she \"Would not send my worst enemy to this hotel !\"; I mean what kind of review is that ? Nonetheless, we arrived and what did we find ?. A light and very clean hotel, with efficient and courteous staff on reception. The bedrooms varied in size and my own had a very comfortable bed; our bathroom was of a generous size with an excellent shower Our breakfasts were entirely adequate and plentiful. I take the criticism made concerning lack of facilities within bedrooms to make a hot drink but there are hot drink machines available to make up the deficiency....Oh, one last thing; regarding the two seater lift. I can only imagine the person making the observation that it was not big enough to hold more that two may one of those larger persons who might have problems with seating in aircraft( If you get my drift).The point is that there is nothing at all wrong with the hotel. I firmly believe that people have a tendency to use sites like Tripadvisor to make salacious remarks masquerading as complaints, in many cases not even to bother to try evidencing them. This can give a false picture of the hotel or restaurant in question. It would also be of great assistance to us potential future customers if the hotel had given a response to the various attacks made upon it............This hotel is well placed and does what it says on the tin.

It was pleasent enough reception staff were very friendly and nice except we were given the wrong room first but was quickly changed. Except we ended up with a room with a balcony door that had a broken handle and could not be locked or shut properly. We told this to staff the next morning, but when we came back in the evening, the night shift receptionist was rude, defensive and sarcastic asking why we were telling him now at this time of night (he misunderstood us) then afterwards said \"if you told us then it will be fixed then\". It hadn't been fixed but rather than cause a scene we just left it for the remained of the holiday as it was reasonably safe. The next day - went out and came back at 1am, the receptionist was missing and the entrance had been locked. After 5 minutes, the same night receptionist popped his head up from upstairs. Then took another 5 minutes to open the door. Went back to the room, key didn't work, but got rectified straight away. Throughout the rest of our stay, the same receptionist continued being rude and condescending which wasn't appreciated at all. Otherwise the rest of the staff were very friendly and professional. The cleaning staff was very professional but when we wanted to let her know she only needed to clean the the sheets we found out she did not understand Spanish, Catalan or English! But we got our message across in the end but was surprising nonetheless. We slept in a first floor room facing the street. Be warned that the Gothic Quarter is a hive of activity at night with plenty of bars, clubs , eateries etc and is full of loud people and street cleaners (trucks) well into the morning. If you are a light sleeper, take some earplugs with you! The breakfast provided is very good for value and has a great range for both meat eaters and vegetarians including cereals, breads, cooked and cold meats, fresh fruit and plenty of cold and hot beverages to get you up in the morning. Cannot really fault this part of our stay. Conclusion - Overall we were satisfied with the hotel. Don't expect to much from it and make the most of its great location in the centre of a great area and Barcelona itself. Our main gripe was that our complaint about the unclosable balcony door wasn't dealt with at all and the single member of staff working at night who was difficult and rude. But it was clean, comfortable, noise was bearable (just), and staff friendly and welcoming. In addition to this review here's a tip for stayers: DO NOT ASK FOR A TAXI FROM THE HOTEL. We had been on taxi trips in the night in Barcelona and the prices are reasonable. Taxi fares start at \u20ac2 but this driver decided to set his meter up from where he started arriving to us at \u20ac2.95 already! Then I noticed as soon as he set off it was going up by 5c every 2 metres! After getting to the end of the road we refused to stay in the taxi the fare was almost \u20ac6 by then. Compare this to just under \u20ac8 after midnight from the same place to Shoko bar in Barceloneta (check it on a map to see). He tried to convince us it costs \u20ac25 from Jaume 1 Metro Station to Placa de Catalunya which is frankly... insane - even at night prices. We had to argue and cause a fuss in public before he backed down and gave us back our luggage. We left without paying him.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNever a 4 star!\u201d", "Author": "maggief_11", "ReviewID": "UR111063882", "Content": "We were also moved to this hotel due to \"water problems\" at the one we had booked.The first room we were given did not even have a working lock on the door.We were moved to another room with tiny windows and no air conditioning working.The following morning after a really awful buffet breakfast we asked to be moved to our original choice of hotel but they still claimed nothing was available.

Also because it was a corner room, you could hear everything from the streets and there was not good sound isolation. We are night owls so we didn't care but for those that do: bring ear plugs. The room was very clean, but pretty dated. The furniture was clean and didn't smell, but was worn-out in places. It was fine, though. It had 2 twinbeds put together that did fit flush next together (although I booked a room that specified 1 double bed), and it was fine. They were comfy, and the sheets were clean. The room was pretty large by European standards. I certainly had enough room for all our stuff, and had things sprawled out and there was still plenty of room to go about your business. The bathroom was also relatively large and clean. If I could guess the dimensions, it's about 12' x 8'. It had an old style tub+shower, with good pressure and good heat. It had 2 sinks with a stone countertop. Hairdryer worked great, and it had the basic stuff: sewing kit, soaps, etc. Toilet and bidet were clean and flushed well. There was an in-room safe which operated fine. The closet space was enough for us, and there was a tube TV which we didn't use. Access: there were ramps to easily roll your luggage around stairs in the lobby. Also, there was 1 tiny elevator, that could barely fit 5 people. But at least if you are wheelchair bound or something, this hotel can accommodate you. Services: the reception spoke very little English. You could get by, but if you know a lick of Spanish it goes a long way. They were pleasant and helpful enough, except this one guy who seemed to be very disinterested to struggle with his English (he was very friendly and nice to this Spanish couple that was just before us). We asked for a wake up call one day and they were 15 minutes late with the call. Internet: there was wifi internet that you had to pay for. They dont have a computer for you, you must use your own if you have one. I didn't. Room service: they were fine. Courteous. Breakfast: i don't remember the exact cost but it was something like 12Euro/person. We didn't eat this so i can't comment. Bar: there was a bar but i never saw it open. Wouldve been nice to have quick access to a relaxing cocktail to wind down your evening but i doubt they were running the bar anytime recently. In all, this hotel was a great bang-for the buck, and if I ever visit Barcelona again, I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, Wales", "Title": "\u201cNice enough but 4*?\u201d", "Author": "CL_Cardiff", "ReviewID": "UR27640634", "Content": "We stayed here for a week in March 2009 and for the price (85EUR/night + tax), it wasn't bad. I have to agree with previous reviewers regarding the sound insulation. The noise from the street, while not excessive, is round the clock and reverberates in the narrow streets. The windows do not provide good insulation and we have stayed in hotels in Barcelona in far noisier locations where the windows kept the noise out much more effectively. The windows also did not lock securely which was a little unnerving. The hotel could really do with spending a little money on this. The rooms are ok and reasonably well furnished, nice floors, comfortable beds. Bathroom was basic (I prefer to see a bit of marble in a 4 star!) but functional. Location is excellent - particularly appreciated the proximity to Santa Clara cake and coffee shop (Who needs a hotel breakfast when you have that?!). Also very handy for metro when wanting to travel outside gothic quarter.

The hotel was smaller than the impression you get from pictures. It was clean (cleaning every day), the room was accomodating in size and standard, not overly extravagant but not rough. Bathroom was ok and clean. The only really big problem was the insulation. At night (if you got a room facing the street as we did) it sounded as if the people were actually in your room or at least that a window was open which was not the fact. Also loud noise from other rooms such as clicking shoes and scraping of furniture. The real plus is it's fantastic location right in the middle of old town, 5 minutes walking to Las Ramblas, the port or Plaza Catalunya. Breakfast was a let down as it did not have great variation, but for Spain I think it was the norm. The last morning though the staff (=person) in the restaurant was nowhere to be seen and the coffee was cold. The staff of the reception took the anomality with perfect calm and was not overly concearned by this... No coffee until the airport therefore. I would give the hotel three stars although it gives a rather elegant impression when you get out of your taxi the first time and see all the chandeliers and marble floors, but in the corridors and room it's more of a three star.

Do not ask the reception staff to order you a cab - they won't. Do not ask them to fill the mini-bar - they tell you to go to the supermarket.
