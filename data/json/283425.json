The room was an adequate size, the beds comfortable, and the showers hot which was all that was required as we were out sightseeing all day. The location was great, with all major sights a managable walk or short bus journey away. Francesco, who was on reception in the evenings, spoke perfect English (albeit with an American accent) and was very friendly and informative. The negatives: More attention could have been paid to cleanliness and maintenance. Bathrooms were a bit cramped. Breakfast was a bit ordinary, 1 large croissant followed by as much bread, butter and jam as you wanted, and tea, coffee or juice. Our room was above a busy street which was very noisy however, our companions had an inner room which was fine. All in all the hotel was quite basic and would be suitable for backpackers on a budget, but if you're after a romantic break and a touch of luxury... steer clear!", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Darlington, County Durham", "Title": "\u201cAll right if you're not staying in the room for much time\u201d", "Author": "Nourrie", "ReviewID": "UR118607883", "Content": "The room, bedding and facilities were clean but the TV did not work and the fridge only operated when the room key was in its holder - no cold drinks except in the morning!

We had received a confirmed booking for 3 nights, however we were forced to stay in a 1 star hotel (Hotel Tizi) on the other side of Rome after arriving to find that the hotel was in fact full for our first night - despite the booking. No offer to help us get there, and the man at reception was very rude. We also had to use other guests to translate as he spoke absolutely no english at all. Not a good first impression. Positive comments: - good location, assuming you actually are able to stay at this hotel for all nights booked. - decent continental breakfast, although you will most likely have to wait for space in the breakfast room, and the man at reception will pace the room looking frustrated until you leave to make room for waiting guests. - shower was large and always warm. Negative comments: - hard to find as you need to enter courtyard before you reach main entrance. - very rude and unhelpful staff, besides the man who was there on our last day - he spoke some english and seemed polite. - no air con, which would be fine if a fan was provided but also no fan, made worse by the fact that the window opened on to the inner courtyard so there was no breeze, very hot nights. - the minibar that was advertised was in the room, but unplugged and dusty so virtually unusable. - the beds were held together with masking tape. - the door handle to the bathroom was broken. - we asked 3 staff members on seperate occassions for the internet password, and were given 3 different answers - none of which worked. - room not cleaned on the 2nd day, only fresh towels were left in the entry. - based on previous reviews about suspected staff theft, we locked up our personal items during day and night, but felt uneasy for the entire stay based on the nature of the staff, although thankfully nothing was stolen. - when we asked about compensation for the inconvenience the hotel had caused, we were rudely refused and told that they would not budge on price. I would advise you to spend a little more money and stay somewhere decent. We thought that its great location would make up for any negative aspects, but we were extremely disappointed.

Easy to find your way to the Termini station; easy to walk to the Via Nationale and other major streets where you can get buses. I would recommend getting the Roma pass if you're staying there three days. If you use the buses, metro, museum and attend cultural events in the same period, you definitely even out the cost. Breakfast is very simple. Rooms are cleaned daily, (but it wasn't squeaky clean to start off with).

Busy street with a lot of traffic, though nice neighbourhood with many good restaurants with decent prices. It's not a hotel where you enjoy staying in your room all day, and I would'n choose it for a romantic getaway - but if you look for a simple accomodation and if you travel with a group of teachers&students which we did, it's perfect. I'd advice you to bring your own towels, the ones in the hotel are really thin and although they were properly washed they still had stains.

I like to consider myself a reflective reviewer - a consultation of my other contributions hopefully emphasizes this, but this hotel really riled me up. For starters it is run by an owner-occupier who clearly doesn't believe in delegation or is too parsimonious to emply staff. He watches over everyone and everything with a zeal that makes you uncomfortable. Insists on a midnight curfew which is outrageous - one night we were at the other side of the city in and had to leave an enjoyable piazza with evening entertainment just to ensure we wouldn't have to ring the bell and endure a tongue-lashing from him. The room is shockingly austere. Italian hotels pride themselves on authenticity and quirky quainteness but this room was so dusty, musty and unrefined it was untrue. Bring anti-histamines and inhalors if you're prone to respiratory problems. The 'bathrooms' were obviously added recently, ridiculous pre-fabricated cublicles wedged in the corner of the room. The walls stop at about 9ft meaning it's essentially like the cubicle in a public toilet. The window shutters were a poor design meaning interrupted sleep with noise from the courtyard below. Breakfast was mediocre. The location is very goof, I'll concede - in the shadow of the Santa Maria Maggiore church, steps from Termini rail station and an easy stroll to the Colosseum. But there are plenty of other hotels in this neighbourhood, do you really want to clamber in a 'door in a gate' (yes that's the entrance - think mechanic's yard!) to access your hotel? Avoid avoid!

The Porter put a curfew on our party to be back by 00.00hrs ( extended to 01.00 hrs after debate) then once all back on sat and in bed by 01.30 hrs my husband and i woke on Sun morning to find we had been robbed. police officers in our party found no forced entry and no entry to be gained via the window. all property stolen including passports. Hotel staff not prepared to call police. just threw map at us and told us to go to police station ( where Interpreteurs only work mon-fri). On return to Hotel, the staff have already cleaned the rooms) British embassy inform us this is regualr ocurrance. Money required prior to personel to be called out at weekend to enable us to get passports to travel home on sunday ( with no promise of being able to help due to their systems not always working - no money - no help). luckily other members of the party helped us out but would have been stuck on sunday otherwise with no money, food or accomodation. This Hotel is situated within a \"secure courtyard\" with buzzer entry only - but with porter insisting that we go to bed immediatley and being very aggitated when we continued having a ciggarrette in the corridor - we can only beleive that he is involved within this organised crime of robbing travellers whislt they are asleep in their hotel room. ** please do not stay at this Hotel * ***if you have already booked then take Caution. ****** hide Spare credit card for cash access , photocopy your passport and keep with you at all times ( helps process with replacement at embassy) and block your door at night.
