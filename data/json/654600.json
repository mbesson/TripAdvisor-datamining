From the charming young lady who supervises breakfast to the cool young dude at the reception desk the service in this hotel I cannot fault. Staying honest with my review, the first night I was kept awake by the people on the other side of the interconnection door of my room. I was just happy that they were not having sex otherwise i would have freaked out!!! Woken up by the same lousy roomys early the next morning I rang down to reception to convey my horror and was offered a room change immediately. Nice, but nothing ticks a paying guest off more than up at night and up in the morning!!! Party season in ibiza I am prepared for but this was ridiculous. The thing that really ruined my stay at this hotel was the bites I received on my arm and on my face whilst staying in room 401 (fabulous view of the marina, room needs to be thoroughly cleaned). found myself taking a holiday snap I had not bargained on (attached). Breakfast reminded me that I travel way too much as the disappointment showed on my face when i saw the ridiculous presentation of a diy version of a continental breakfast! the first thing that went through my head is why the hell i had not stayed at the hotel Axel like i had planned! Gotta say, fabulous roof terrace which is a genuine suntrap. To be honest, wont be going back, nice views, not a terrible hotel but not a wonderful one.

Because I was here during the off-season, the hotel was very quiet, there was plenty of room at breakfast time, checking in and out was a breeze and the rate was very reasonable (under 70 euros). My room was small but efficient, clean and tastefully done. The bathroom may not have been large but I never felt cramped. As far as noise, I did not hear my neighbors (maybe I had none?). I could hear some street noise although this was not very loud (of course, the sidewalks were not very crowded). My room did not have a mini-bar but that was not a big deal for me since I can never get myself to pay for the inflated prices (even when a client is paying for my expenses). There are plenty of stores nearby where you can purchase water, drinks and any snacks you might need. I liked that the room came with a safe large enough to fit my laptop. If you have a 15\u201d laptop, you should have no problems storing it in there. The staff was very friendly and always ready to help. The lady working the breakfast area was especially chatty, friendly and fun to visit with. There was a couple with a young child having breakfast when I was there and she made sure the child ate well and even sent them off with water and snacks for their day of sightseeing. (By the way, there was plenty to choose from for breakfast.) The location is excellent with easy access to the beach, marina and a 5-minute walk to MB92 (for those of us that are here for work). Las Ramblas is an easy walk and Plaza Catalunya is not too far, either (I chose to walk to Plaza Catalunya instead of taking the bus or metro). Bus and subway access are nearby and they will get you to just about anywhere in the city and even to the airport (taxi ride from the airport to the hotel was about 25 euros).

This is in the neighborhood of Barceloneta, quite near the main beach of Barcelona. In fact, for this property, it is all about location, location, location. For you Americans out there, this property is actually a franchise of the Best Western chain, although you would never know it by the property. Located about 300 meters from the beach, it has a perfect location on Passieg de Joan de Borbo, the main artery of Barceloneta leading to the beach. It is nestled among many shops and cafes. The property has been updated to a modest, but somewhat sleek contemporary design. A design that separates it from the many older looking buildings (mostly apartments) that surround it. There are just 28 rooms in this hotel. The rooms are Euro-small with little amenities. I had a basic room looking over Joan de Borbo, which many of their rooms do. Decorated in grey and a sort of off shaded blue, these rooms are a bit dark in the inside as is the halls leading to the rooms. However, the bed is comfortable, and the bathroom facilities, although once again, small, are very pleasant. Each room contains a flat screen TV of about 23\u2033 for those of you who cannot bag your jet lag. The staff is guarded but helpful. Now of course, Americans are not the most popular anywhere you travel these days, and you feel it here as well. It took several days for me to figure which of the staff at the front desk were the most helpful and out going. 3 to 4 days into it, three such staff warmed up and became most helpful in suggestions for dining, hanging, and assistance for tours. English is spoken fairly well at this hotel: a comfort for those Americans and many English speaking Euro countries who visit here. Breakfast is included with the room for most pricing plans. The breakfast is modest with cereals, yogurts, prepackaged croissants. There was also the obligatory breakfast meets and cheeses popular in Europe. All was self serve with the exception of the coffee, which the single person manning the breakfast served directly upon request. Again, the serve was divided here, one person on several of the days did not speak a word and it was difficult to get her attention to get another coffee\u2026.and the remaining two days, it was manned by a person beaming with personality and a desire to assure you had enough coffee and breakfast. The breakfast area is small. Overflow people eat in the lobby chairs. Now the star of this hotel is the roof top access, pictured to the left. This is a stunning view of Port Vell and Barcelona city as well. Very little used, this is a great place to take a bottle of wine up to relax and let the city slowly drift to sleep, under the ever presence of Monsarret in the top of the mountain in the distance. There is a bar area in the lobby for which you can get a drink if you can get the front desk to mix it (the bar does not have a bar tender), or if you bring your own wine, they will be happy to give you a glass and a cork screw to work your own magic. Out of the six nights at this property, I spent three of them up here with my wine after sampling the fare of the cafes in the city below. This place is not inexpensive. I was at the beginning of the prime tourist season, and my room averaged 140E per night. They were completely booked the entire time. A quick check of their website HOTEL 54 yields similar rates. Again, this is all about location. One of the criticisms is that the rooms tend to be a bit noisy as they face the main street. I did not find this too annoying. There was some noise, but nothing that could not be dealt with. If this is an issue for you, request a non-street facing room. Do provide some calorie budget for the close by options to Hotel 54. Not only is it in the center of Barceloneta with its many great cafes serving fresh seafood with more eyes staring back at you than you care to count, or great dishes of traditional paella, there is a gelato/ice cream shop beneath Hotel 54. Yes, I was here every night and loved it. Overall, I highly recommend Hotel 54. This high recommendation does come with caveats. First, you must want to be a beach rat. This is all about its proximity to Barceloneta beach, the ports, the shopping mall in Port Vell, and the cafes. Second, do be aware of the petty robberies. Barceloneta, with its high population of back packers (read young people without a job) is worse than usual for thieves. And these thieves prey on the hotels where they know tourists will be more venerable. Be aware. I was not completely, and did get a back pack stolen in front of the hotel\u2026\u2026.my bad, I guess, was not careful enough. So this is a word to you who may take this recommendation.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly adequate for the money, brilliant location.\u201d", "Author": "Awhulluk", "ReviewID": "UR110145765", "Content": "I sometimes wonder when reading other reviews what some people expect from a 3* hotel at the prices that you pay.

I chose this Hotel 54 Barceloneta due to the reviews on here and I wasn't disappointed. I was travelling alone so I wanted a cheap hotel close to the centre and this ticked all the boxes. Location: 5 minutes walk to the beach and there's restaurants, supermarkets and a pharmacy on the same street. Lots of restaurants close by. The Port Olympic area is only a 20 minute walk and the Aquarium a 10 minute walk. Las Ramblas is around a 20-25 minute walk. Hotel room: Modern and quite basic (I had a single room) and the rooms were very clean but there's no bath only a shower facility but a very good shower! The rooms are quire small for single rooms. The major complaint I had was that the rooms were not soundproof so if you have a room at the front of the hotel be aware as it can get quite noisy. There are no major clubs or anything nearby so there's no noise really late at night, except for you hear the other guests getting back to their rooms. My main issue with the rooms was the soundproofing, I would take ear plugs if I stayed here again. Breakfast: Contiental buffet breakfast which is nice. There is no cooked breakfast on offer but lots of croissants, cakes, yoghurts, cereal etc, which I thought was more then enough choice including meat/cheese/bread rolls. I would rather they had pots of coffee out instead of you having to ask the 1 very busy waiter each time for another coffee. There was only 1 member of staff on at breakfast and he was very busy and not very friendly (but hey, I had been used to the breakfast at the Hilton on the previous days! so I must not complain). I recommend you take a kettle for the room though as there's no tea/coffee facilities available and none provided. Breakfast area is very small so goodness knows what it's like when the hotel is very busy. Reception staff are nice and friendly and there's a small seating area downstairs with free WIFI. There's also free WIFI in the hotel rooms (passwords given in the hotel guide) which was a really fast service. Overall, if you are happy with a cheap, budget no frills hotel that's close to the beach and not too far from the town centre with a Pharmacy, good restaurants, and 2 supermarkets very close by then this would be a great choice.

The hotel room faced the port. Having just arrived from a long flight we needed some rest, At 6 pm the fairground across the street started and the room was literally shaking. The staff moved us to another box of a room, at the back of the hotel where by midnight we fell asleep in our very hard bed. We had accepted a room with a broken sink for the promise of a quiet night's sleep. The following evening, yes we could hear the fair but at eleven o'clock a band started in the street, the place was shaking until past two in the morning. The maids were in the corriddor at 8 in the morning. We were quite simply shattered. We complained to the staff who were unable to do anything, they too they said were tired!! Not up to Best Westerns normal three star standard. If you need more than 6 hours sleep don't stay there.

On arrival it all seemed ok, just a small hotel that has made efforts to make itself look as modern as possible in order to disguise its shortcomings. The location is great. However once you see past the \"modern\" stylings, the facade rather falls away. You can't polish a t*rd as they say, and this remains a rather pokey little place. The rooms are small and of weird layout. The floor is all tiled, so careful you don't go AoverT when you come out of the bathroom! Breakfast was nothing special - but the coffee was hot and the bread fresh - so no complaints there. The \"bar\" is real let down. I asked for a \"drinks list\" and was virtually laughed at...so always remembering he who laughs last, laughs longest - I simply went to spend my hard earned elsewhere. The maid service however provided something of a shock. One morning, the maid let some random woman into my room. Upon waking and telling her to get out - the maid and the mystery woman simply stood by the open door chatting despite my eager requests that they should shut the DOOR! Hmm, quite sure this isn't the way its meant to work! Would I stay there again? Only if I was sent there by someone else - there is no way I would actually book it myself...despite the great location.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "yorkshire", "Title": "\u201chotel 54\u201d", "Author": "cns259", "ReviewID": "UR17681148", "Content": "This is a relatively new hotel, and it has recently been taken over by Best Western. It still retains the air of a small boutique hotel though, and isn't at all corporate. The reception area is very modern and cool looking, and includes an attractive bar. It seems to be under-used though. It couldn't be described as \"lively\"....not necessarily a bad thing. Reception were friendly and helpful, especially the girls. the two male members of staff were less forthcoming, but I think they might be less confident of their English language skills. Check in was simple, though we arrived at lunchtime and the room wasn't quite ready, which was fair enough. It was ready within 30 minutes. It's the sort of hotel that doesn't have staff all over you, taking your bags etc. You are pretty much left to get on with things yourself...again, no bad thing in my book. The corridors are dark, but they're not too bad, and it wasn't a significant problem for us. It's just modern chic....LED lighting, that kind of thing. The room itself was a twin at the front of the Hotel, though they had put the beds together, as requested. Very stark modern decor, but cool and funtional. Watch out for sharp corners (particularly on the modern french windows, they open inwards and it's easy to slice your foot with the corner if you are not careful and are wearing sandals). The window opens onto a small balcony with fab views over the port side of Barceloneta, and across to Montjuic. There's an LCD TV, with plenty of channels, but none English. If you want to watch TV here, you're in the wrong place anyway. The phone is Jacob Jensen, which should give you an idea where the hotel style is. There's a wet room and stylish wash area. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the lighting is LED with switchable mood colours. The room was clean and comfortable (though you have to be someone who likes a firm mattress). There's a small fridge/minibar, which is useful, and it's only stocked with basics. The only down side to the room.was that all the concrete seemed to transmit noise quite efficiently, so you could almost hear the neighbours brushing their teeth. However, it is not a noisy party hotel. The other guests all seemed to be either singles, or couples, and several of them same sex. In the original brochures, the hotel is described as Gay friendly, which it certainly seemed to be. It's not really a family hotel, though I understand the suite is a good family space. Breakfast was simple, and the coffee was great. It was included in our price. I wouldn't have wanted to pay more than 10 euros for it though. Now to the two absolute stand out features of the hotel. The first is the location. It is brilliant. A minute's walk to the beach and new promenade. The port in front of the hotel and all the restaurants along side. Very close to the port cable car. The Barceloneta market and the small cafe squares of the Barceloneta district are all on your doorstep. The Born district is about 10 minute's walk, the Barrio Gothic about 15 minutes and the Ramblas about 25 minutes. We walked everywhere with no problem. The second stand out feature is the roof terrace with a panoramic view over the city, from Sagrada Familale to Montjuic. We had it to ourselves for pretty much the entire weekend. Superb, and like the bar, seemingly under-used. All in all, I would have given this top marks, but have deducted points because I think it is expensive for what you get. However, this will maybe keep it quiet and exclusive. We will definitely go back.

The bathroom was again small, but it was nice, although everything seemed a little unfinished - tiling, paint work etc One of the biggest problems was the squeky bed. we couldnt even roll onto our side without the bed making an enormous creak.
