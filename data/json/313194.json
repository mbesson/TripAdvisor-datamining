Also, this was my first stay in Rome so I don't have comparisons. That being said, it seems I got what I paid for... except when I didn't. I paid extra to not be \"in a sepearate building\" and yet I was in a building around the corner from the easy to miss \"lobby.\" I arrived at the address I was given on my reservation and was simply confronted with a blank locked door of what appears to be an apartment building. After standing confused and ringing buttons, a neighbor led me to the lobby around the corner on a different street. If you do stay here look for the sign of the Rendezvous Restaurant as the check deck shares a store front with them. DO NOT use their transportation from the airport. At their offer, I requested a car (for a 49e fee) to meet me at the airport. No driver arrived at the airport and I had to arrange my own transport. I tried to call the hotel to see if one was on its way and there was no answer on several tries. Good news was I saved 24e by taking a shuttle. The reservation also said that wifi was available in all the rooms. This became wifi available in all the rooms with a charge. Once I paid the 5e charge, it turned out that wifi was not available in my room. Their solution was that I could use the wifi in the restaurant. I ordered a beer in the restaurant (a large draft) and was given a bill for 10e for the beer. I was not even given the 10% discount off of this ridiculous price promised on my check in paper. I went into the lobby to use the computer to avoid using a table/pressure to get 10e beers and was asked to leave the lobby because \"it was a place of business\" - eventhough there were no other customers in the lobby. The staff (if 1 person at a desk is a staff) was never of help. No 110 electricity converter was available and when I asked where I could buy one they said they had no idea. I asked about currency exchange and was told that they did not do it. I asked who did and they said \"probably one of the banks in town.\" No specifics were available. I asked if they had English language channels on the TV and was told \"I don't know just scroll around and see if you find one.\" Breakfast was included but pathetic, and managed by an angry man I assume was one of the owners. Each of my 2 days there I had to wait on coffee for up to 10 minutes along with many other patrons, including some who were very vocal in their anger and disappointment. Cosidering it was hosted in the back of their restaurant the bland quality and lack of selection was insane. The location was great for visiting the Vatican and fine for other sites if you don't mind an extensive walk. Also, the metro is only 5 min away and I found it easy to use. Basically, my recommendaton is to spend $20 more and get MUCH better accomodations. I plan on coming back to Rome soon, and I definitely will stay elsewhere.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Il Gzira, Malta", "Title": "\u201cIt was Amazing\u201d", "Author": "Andrewm41193", "ReviewID": "UR117704816", "Content": "The Hotel was Luruxy as the rooms name luruxy room and the price was average, the waiters were helpful because they spoke in english language so we can communicate.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vilnius, Lithuania", "Title": "\u201cOnly if you a looking for best location\u201d", "Author": "Karolina12345", "ReviewID": "UR115838546", "Content": "Hotel has good location, but other things is not so good, when you pay as for 4 star hotel.

The hotel has a very nice location, and is literally a 5 minute walk to the Vatican. It was a little difficult to find as the rooms seemed to be in various residential buildings around a block and the reception is across next to a cafe that also doubles up as a breakfast part of the B&B. But the staff was friendly and they found us while we were looking for the hotel. The room we stayed in was decent sized but it was in an old apartment building. The closet, for instance, did not have a handle to open and the seat on the WC was chipped. The shower stall was also small but that seems to be the case generally there. It was also more expensive than our previous hotel in the city, but I think the premium was due to its proximity to the Vatican. The breakfast at the restaurant was a little disappointing as the buffet was not replenished often and you had empty plates with a couple of pastries left and 2-3 people waiting to get food. There is also no free Internet. Still, our overall stay was comfortable and the location is terrific. We spent most of the time outside walking around Rome and the Vatican anyway.

Our choice for the hotel was based on location and others' reviews on this website.\u00a0 When we arrived at reception, we were led to our stay which was located a bit down the block from reception. We ordered the two-room suite for 5 nights for 3 people. The suite is immaculate, with a jacuzzi and a full kitchen, although the stove does not work or is not meant to work, it's still nice to have a kitchen. The staff was warm and helpful. Our only complaint is the troll-like old man who apparently is the owner's father and feels like the staff is not up to par on their duties, constantly ordering them around when they are busy with other duties and being rude and disrespectful in general. Perhaps that is old school Italian that I am not familiar with but why get pissy with guests who are spending quite a large sum of money staying at your hotel? However.... On our fourth day's stay, I wanted an extra cappuccino for me and my mother. We had one each. The old man started counting in Italian and looking very angry. I do not speak Italian but took Latin in school. There were two other guests around who did speak Italian and he started mocking me and my family in Italian to them with me standing there! One of the guests said that only two was included with the meal. I then inquired, ok well i only had one. He then put his hand to his cheek and made a gesture to suggest that we were thick-skinned and mentioned two words that I did understand. Familiae and Cinese. Family and Chinese.. Perhaps I looked young (im a Wall St professional and could have recommended colleagues to stay there on trips) and did not speak the language so he thought it okay to call me and my family names. If he wanted me to pay for the extra cappuccino, he could have just explained and told me how much it cost... It was an unnecessarily degrading experience. I still would recommend this hotel as the other staff was very accommodating, the rooms are of good value, and the location is prime... but I hope that the owner takes note that the hotel will lose lots of business because of the busy old man running around. One thing I noticed that was quite funny was that some napkins had inconsistent folds on them, meaning somebody (probably the cheap old man), took the un-used (hopefully) off the table guests left and put them back in the napkin pile! I actually had no problem with this as times are tough and napkins are napkins, they wipe, folded or not.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, cosy & well located, but poor shower!\u201d", "Author": "Paris12", "ReviewID": "UR80346363", "Content": "My main criteria for booking this hotel was the location (3 blocks from a subway station and a short 5-minute walk to the Vatican) as well as the rate compared to similar class hotels around Rome.

The room was a nice surprise, very clean, furnished in a 18th century style with elegant color schemes (dark blue rug, golden walls, brown furniture, old drawings, etc.). The bathroom was a big letdown though. The shower was tiny, with an extra long curtain closing half of the opening and a sliding door closing the other half. Nothing in the shower to hold soap or shampoo... and you can't bend since it's tiny. I let you imagine how awkward it was! Slight issues with the power plugs, very dingy and not all of them working.

The hotel is very well situated at about a quarter mile from the Vatican on a nice relatively \"quiet\" street (for Rome, that is, since there wasn't that much traffic on the street itself). As many others have noted, the metro is about a five mintute walk from the hotel, and there are countless restaurants, cafes, and even gelatto places, near the hotel. What was truly helpful was that right next to the lobby is a small grocery store that sells 1L bottled water for 1 EU, which is the thing to do: buy a bunch of these bottles and use them to refill smaller bottles that you can carry with you (unless you prefer to spend 2-3 EU for a tiny bottle of water, or 3-5 EU for a can of soda, at a restaurant. The grocery store has cookies, fresh fruit, kleenex in case you get sick, etc...good cross-section of items. But back to the hotel: Accomodations: roomy with two twins that can be put together to turn into a queen; LCD TV with cable (no DVD or VCR); super-dark curtains/shades that will make you think it's midnight even at noon...outstanding windows that keep ALL the street noise out...wish high-end hotels in the USA had this configuration; telephone with free local calls...can't make toll-free calls (800) due to \"restrictions and contractual arrangements\" with the hotel's long-distance telephone service provider; high-speed internet throughout, and free....but confirm via email with hotel staff before you get there to avoid any possible \"confusion\" when you get there...nothing like having a printed copy of an email on hand in which they promise free wifi, just in case (I do this everywhere I travel, even in the USA, so nothing against the hotel); the room itself is \"smallish\" compared to customary USA standards, but not by much; the bathroom is a good size; others complain about the shower being small, but it shouldn't be a factor if you are \"normal\" size...if you are overweight/obese, well, you'll have a hard time fitting in anywhere, so please don't whine about \"tiny showers\"; housekeeping service is efficient and does a good job cleaning up...plenty of nice, clean, good-sized, towels; there is a small refrigerator built into the desk (we discovered it the day we left...haha); yes, there are non-contiguous \"wings\" to the hotel of various rooms, but they are separated behind a separate, private, keyed, hall door that is not accessible to the other building tenants; for those with any doubts: THE A/C WORKS PERFECTLY WELL AND IS EXTREMELY COLD, IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT IT...we had to turn it up a bit at night, and had to use a blanket....so you can set whatever temperature makes you happy...if you can't figure out how to use the A./C, just ask the front desk and they will be glad to show you. Breakfast is OK, and free: includes coffee, tea, etc.; consists of boiled eggs, a couple of cereals; yoghurt; a couple of choices of fruit; LOTS of choices of rolls, sandwhiches, etc., with ham, cheese, fruit, and other fillings. No hot foods, but it's a VERY SOLID breakfast -- much more extensive than the typical \"continental\" breakfast. Location: My daughter and I walked 10-20 miles per day, on average; we only took the metro a couple of times...the only way to get to know the culture is to live it. If you don't want to walk, take the metro or get a more centrally located hotel on the other side of the river (I would recommend somewhere away from Trevi and Navona, but in the \"general vicinity\" of those locales...that's what I would do next time, simply to be a bit closer to \"the sights\"). I'll be happy to talk specifics with you in private, but the bottom-line is that the Hotel Les Chambers D'Or is a marvelous hotel, good location, great accomodations, \"reasonable\" price (vs other hotels), solid staff, and I would MOST CERTAINLY recommend it. PS Best things we saw: 1. Pallatine Hill (Forum is overrated); 2. Ostia Antica...do web search on getting there via metro...MUCH nicer than Pompeii, and closer, cheaper, less crowded, bigger, greener, less dusty, etc.... 3.

As I have a gluten free diet the young man who greeted us warmly promised all sorts for breakfast, but as he was not on duty for the rest of the stay, it did'nt happen. The only service we had was a coffee.. everything else was self service in a cramped area. The room was fine, but there was no air conditioning and we had to keep the window open in 28 degrees( lovely) in order to sleep. That was soon shattered by the club life opposite..Giorni... they came out to smoke, argue and shout at each other, quite an entertainment! It lasted until 3.30am.

I met a group of friends here in August and felt good about the experience by the time I left. Upon arrival I intended to take public transportation to the hotel, and was pleasantly surprised to see someone waiting for me at the airport with my name on a sign. I was driven in a nice clean van directly to the hotel, and then informed that I must pay 45 euros to the driver. Silly me, I figured that if they were going to show up without asking me that it must be included in the hotel. My friends had been warned about this, and made other transportation arrangements...but all said and done, it was probably a good thing since I got to the hotel so easily and safely while alone. The hotel has rooms spread across 3 different buildings...and since we didn't notify the staff in advance, my group was split up across a street. Calls between the rooms were free, so it wasn't really a problem. The room was very nice, with a huge bed and a tiny, but clean and updated bathroom. The AC was a bonus since it was so hot at the time. The breakfast at the hotel was perfect for us....mainly breads, cereals, yogurts, cheeses and meats...but the best part was that the hours went until about noon....so we could sleep in and still enjoy the breakfast, and we didn't even bother buying lunch. The prices around the hotel area are pretty steep, 8 euros per beer...but the hotel offered a much better rate since we were staying there. The staff was extremely helpful...they googled restaurants we wanted to go to, called them to make sure they were open, helped us find plug adapters for our Germany and US electronics and more. At the end of my trip, they even drove me to the train station since there was some confusion about arranging a shuttle ride. Wifi cost 10 euros for the entire stay. It worked in my room, and at the hotel lobby/breakfast area...but my friends had trouble picking up the signal in their room across the street. Junior was the most pleasant staff member, and Alessandro and Samuel were extremely helpful and warm people. They gave me a good impression of Rome hospitality. Between the 4 of us, we shared 2 rooms and paid 80 euros each (including breakfast).

To bend over to pick up something meant both ends were touching something if you know what I mean... The hotel is a block away from Piazza Risorgimento. From there, you can take the bus anywhere in the city or walk right to the Vatican Museum or St Peter Square. I suggest getting a \"Roma Pass\" for 20 Euro. With this you have unlimited transportation within the city for 3 days, as well as 2 or 3 free admissions to the archaeological sites or museums as well as the ability to skip the lines.

From Piazza Del Popolo, you can walk to tons of other sites such as the Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Castel St Angelo... I suggest taking a tour through the Vatican. That is not included in the Roma pass and you will definitely need to skip the line here. (Thats included when you sign up for a tour) The food was awesome at Riz Cafe in Risorgimento square (most of our meals were eaten here) But at the Chambres d'Or, they also have great food with a discount for those booked here.

First of all, the rooms are rooms they rent and are spread out at different locations. The first room they gave us was around the corner in a different building. I booked a room for three, my wife, my 26 year old son and myself. The room I booked was advertised as a room with a queen sized bed and a sofa bed. It had the queen sized bed but no sofa bed instead it had two twin beds in this tiny room where we were walking all over ourselves. The air conditioning did not work and because we arrived at 5:00 pm, they would not be able to have a technician there until the following morning. If you have been to Rome before in the summer, it is very warm there. Needless to say at the $300 per night rate, I told them that that was not acceptable and since they were booked fully, that they find me another hotel. They then moved us to another room across the hall which was equally cramped. (We noticed later that night, our original room had new occupants, presumably those individuals that were suppose to get our new room). When we checked in, they told me that the room was the best that they had. When they moved us, they again said that the new room was their best. They advertise Wi-Fi but it is not available due to \"security reasons.\" So to be able to get Internet access, we had to go down to the small lobby. They then gave us a network cable to plug into their Internet access. After going through several cables and reboots every evening we tried, two out of the four nights we were there it worked.

We did all the usual trips, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps etc. We went to St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday for the Mass celebrated by the Pope & also his Easter blessing .

He and the staff were the most efficient, helpful, and friendly group in all of Italy! Please note that this hotel is divided in a few different buildings. We stayed 1 night in a very small twin room but when we saw the difference in size with the room next door we asked for a larger room and was graciously moved into a much larger superior room overlooking the street. The hotel was very clean and it is a constant work in progress. While we were there the staff strived to make improvements on a daily basis. There is a high tech security system which was a plus. It ls also located within 10 minutes walk to the Vatican. The breakfast consisted of the best cappucino that we had in all of Italy, croissants, pastry, A couple of suggestions was to add kleenex and pens/writing paper in the rooms. Please note that you keep your room key and you have to go through various doors/locks to reach your room. The only issue we and others had a very difficult time was trying to open the door on the 4th floor. There were several locks and if you did not turn the key a certain way it would not open. We had to call the desk at 10:30 pm to have someone help open the door. Besides that the beds were very comfortable. Also, we want to thank the staff because of the morning of our departure, one of our passports was missing (we think it was stolen on the last day of our departure while shopping), we went back to the hotel and they helped us search our old room and called the American Embassay, arranged transportation, and worked out a deal for us with the taxi driver so we could try and still make our flight.

The plus side of this arrangement is that you exit straight on to the street (the apartments are very secure and have their own concierge) and not through a hotel reception. You don\u2019t feel you are in a hotel. The location is excellent for the Vatican \u2013 literally a five-minute walk. For the rest of Rome that means a good half hour walk to the Coliseum, forty-five minutes to Spanish Steps etc., which after a couple of days we found wearisome. Taxis are cheap and recommended. Six Euros will get you back to the hotel late at night from anywhere central. Overall I would say the hotel deserves its high Tripadvisor rating and would without hesitation recommend this hotel on location if you are spending most of your time in the Vatican/St Peter\u2019s area. If you\u2019re wanting an easy walk to the Pantheon, Coliseum etc, then you might want the check around first. The hotel does represent excellent value for money; I would be surprised if you were to find a better quality room at their price within 4k of central Rome.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cGood service makes all the difference\u201d", "Author": "R0sh", "ReviewID": "UR8349266", "Content": "The service is the best advantage of this hotel. Nice, young, friendly staff volunteered all the local information on transport, tourist places, etc. They gave us a free map and pencilled in the bust route for the attractions we wanted to see. They also offered to arrange a taxi to take us to the airport (Ciampino), but unfortunately we had already bought return bus tickets to the train station. They said the taxi would have cost 45 euros (we were 4 people), I think it's 30 euros for 1 person and from then a supplemment for each additional person. Location is excellent, it really is about 300 yd from the Vatican and Metro station. Also, free complimentary drink on arrival (including alcohol) was very welcomed on the hot summer afternoon I arrived on. Breakfast and food in general OK to fill you up until the afternoon, but that is it. Breakfast was cold buffet with cereals, croissants, snadwiches and bagels filled with cheese, ham, tuna etc. There were also fruit, yoghurts and desserts. No hot food. Capuccino was great though, as it is in most places you buy one in Rome. We had a quadruple room and it was OK, but nothing extraordinary. I quite liked the flat 32\" LCD TV in the room, maybe because it's the same one I have at home. Several national and international TV channels were available I have stayed in central Rome before and I think it is generally difficult to find a nice, comfortable place to stay (I'm not talking about luxury) in a reasonable area (for example the area around the train station looks a bit dodgy), so provided popularity doesn't make them drop the standard of their service I would definitely reccommend this hotel to anyone visiting Rome.", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great food & the best staff.\u201d", "Author": "Neesybella", "ReviewID": "UR8218365", "Content": "This hotel was an absolute gem!

We were given a choice of smoking or non smoking, but unfortunately as a smoker in our mist required a smoking room we ended up with the smaller bathroom, not really a problem but the shower was soooo small, the only downside to our room.The hotel is situated two blocks from the Vatican and St Peters, a short walk for the metro station and has some beautiful shops. Restaurants are more expensive, especially just outside the Vatican walls and St Peters, so walk a few streets away and save a small fortune. Buy your water and drinks in small grocery stores for as little a 40 cents not 3 euros!! Good selection of restaurants at termmi station and are very reasonable, try the Road House Grill on the ground floor for lovely steaks at a very cheap price \u00a315 euros all in, and the large self service restaurant on the upper floor. This is a good place to eat as you could be there at some point in the day while getting metro, bus or tours. Good tour is the open tram bus.For 12 euros see the city and it is stop and go. Get off where you want and pick up the bus again. If you get it early you can see most of the main sights and spend some time at them and get a good feel for the city.
