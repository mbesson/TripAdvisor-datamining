The front desk was very pleasant and gave us suggestions on places to eat, places to see, things to do. Taxis are outside the hotel door so transportation was not a problem and we did not have to rent a car.

We read the comments on TA and asked for a quiet room. I think we got the most quiet room one can get, in the middle of the building, with no windows. So OK, bizar, quiet, but also not for people with claustrophobia. The bed had known better times. The bathroom was small and the shower was far from perfect. So if you go for simple, with some surprises but clean, Belgica is OK. Also to mention, service level at the reception was super. We booked through Booking.com and a free breakfast was included. Problem is you could hardly call it breakfast. In the lobby on a small table were a thermos and a plate with 4 muffins. Needless to say we went out for breakfast, which we found in one of the souvenir shops on the square, just around the corner of the hotel. Still, the hotel being just around the corner f the main square in ponce, location is great.

Way too nosiy and did not get a good sleep at all. My parents had the room next door and did not hear all the raucous and slept very well. So stay away from the street rooms if you can help it!

We went walking around the plaza, just a few steps away, they had artisans displaying stunning wood carvings as well as sculpture clay art; very pretty and the artisans are also very knowledgeable and eager to answer any question you may have about their craft. They also had pretty and inexpensive hand made souvenirs; far from the \"made in China\" rubbish and a much more elegant gift. Right across we saw a long line of locals waiting to buy ice cream, so we decided to follow suit... And it was so worth it! Made on site every day, ice cream in all kinds of fruit flavors as well as vanilla and chocolate. Oh my goodness, we tried guan\u00c3\u00a1bana, coco (coconut), parcha (passion fruit) and fresa (strawberry). They were all very tasty and delicious and wish I could have tried them all!

The hotel staff was helpful and pleasant. A light continental breakfast comes free with the room and is served in the charming lobby. Don't expect a big buffet; this is just coffee, juice, and a few baked goods. Note also that the lobby, hallways, and other public spaces in the hotel are not air-conditioned, as some of them are open to the outdoors. The room AC worked fine though, necessary at almost all times in this climate. The room was very clean and nicely furnished. The 12 foot ceilings and scrollwork door transoms in the guest rooms are clear evidence of the building's age and old-world stylings. We paid about $90 a night with tax for a room that was plenty large for three people. Considering you'd probably pay the same or more for a room in a bland chain hotel in a less convenient location, we think this was a good value. Ponce itself is a very interesting small city, a mix of grandeur and decay. If you're used to the cosmopolitan bustle of San Juan you may be disappointed.

The price is unbelievably low and it's directly around the corner from the plaza. To call it no frills is somewhat accurate, but fails to capture the charm of this 100 year old hotel and it's lovely lobby, rooms, and Spanish balconies hanging directly over Calle Villa. The staff was very friendly, allowing me to park on the street directly in front of the entrance, even though it was marked for drop offs. The rooms in the front (with the balconies) are the prettiest, but (as I was advised by the manager when making my reservation) could be noisy from the street. You see, the Belgica doesn't have windows, just wooden doors with shutters, so the sounds of the street are ever present. But, no matter: Earplugs helped me sleep, and the lively sounds of the city were part of the atmosphere the rest of the time. And it's not completely no frills: There's air conditioning, serviceable wi-fi, a small flat screen TV, and an updated tiled bathroom that supplied a nice hot shower when needed.

Ponce is hardly a tourist destination, but it does have some pretty sites and fairly cheap eats. Right across the Belgica is a small cafe that serves delicious plate lunches and only a short walk away is a great bakery. The ice cream shop across the plaza is crazy good.

(I am sorry to say that I couldn't meet him, since I was on the run every day trying to absorb as much of the culture as possible, and attending to some planned events). The rooms have no telephone, no hair dryer, or iron, and yes, it can get noisy at times. I travel with ear plugs for this reason, so be ready and take yours. At this hotel , you are in the city, so expect noise! The beds were comfortable, the room and bathroom were clean. You will have a fridge, Tv, and place to hang your clothes, but no closet. You can't have everything in life, and a good traveler adapts. The staff was helpful and nice. Much better than at many other places I have stayed in the states, and in several countries in Europe. They are just simple hard working people who wants to be hospitable.. Do not expect a buffet breakfast either. It's very simple, just to get you going. The coffee could be better though. Suggestion to management: Puerto Rico has great coffee, and if you serve good coffee, you can help the economy by telling them what coffee you're serving.. the hotel can even sell it! Just charge it to the room! There's no elevator, true, but the staff is willing to help out with luggage. I have a herniated disk and was helped. Also, be aware that parking is limited. We had trouble on Saturday night, when the lounges and bars are crowded. Parking is limited at any time of the day around the square, anyways. Avoid parking in dark areas, of course. On Sunday, July 13th, there was a Santeros Fair, and unfortunately we couldn't stay but a lot of this art was offered, along with typical music. Make sure to have some of the ice cream at King's Cream by the Melia Hotel. Visit the cathedral and the historic Casa Poventud. Admire the old building that housed the Banco Popular and visit the City Hall. You will find souvenir stores but be aware that less then half of the merchandise is locally made. On a sad note, I was heartbroken to see so many historic houses/ mansions that have been abandoned or vandalized in the area. I can't believe the government have allowed this to happen.

We had front room on the street which was clean and the ac was amazingly capable considering the lack of glass windows, instead old wood shutters on a narrow balcony.

On the second morning at 5 am, someone dropped a string of M80's in the street which reverberated throughout the square. The previous evenings were accompanied by a huge police presence. This is their government square and back here we'd call it disturbing the peace. The cannon fire was shortly followed (5+ am) by a sound truck going up and down the streets with blaring music. We could not wait to escape town and thankfully, the car had not been blown up. The hotel... we were fortunate in having a very helpful desk clerk who invited us to use the parking meter fund the next morning and gave us good advice on where to eat (Cafe Thomas about two blocks away). We could not locate the \"underground parking\" and spent some time moving the car around in the street (remember it was a huge celebration going on!) The clerk that evening could speak no English. An arrival that night would have been more difficult. It's 28 long steps up to the rooms, no elevator, no help. We had lots of baggage. That was back breaking. Continental breakfast was passable and that's all, but for the room price, you can't expect more. I searched for accomodations from Cabo Rojo to Ponce and could find nothing affordable and consistently good. One place had a review saying \"a long drive for breakfast...\" no thanks. So, they need better hotels and more tourists. Until then, be prepared for the problem stays.

However, I did have to go the reception desk to request washcloths, as that seemed to be a rarity there. The rooms were unusually small, and the TV did not have cable at all. But you get what you pay for. All-in-all, I had a great experience, and the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. For the money, I would definitely stay there again.

The room proved to be the biggest mistake of our vacation. We did try to tough it out there, but decided during our sleepless night that we would be leaving in the morning. We were determined to find a place to stay and made our way to Ponce. We were lucky to have found Hotel Belgica. It is in the heart of Ponce and offers very convenient access to the beautiful attractions that Ponce has to offer. We chose a windowless room on the advice of one of the employees to avoid the noise of the nightlife. The room was very clean and the staff was very polite and helpful in getting around the town. We will definitely keep Hotel Belgica in mind on our next trip to Puerto Rico. A good tip before you decide to do ANYTHING. Take the trolley tour for $2.00 offered at the Fire House. With the tour, you get a coupon book with tons of great offers. We visited the Museum de Ponce BEFORE we took the tour. The coupon book had a nice discount for visiting the museum. Not only do you get the savings book, the tour itself is more than worth the price of admission. The tour is given in both Spanish and English. The trolley stops at a sports museum, observes one of the oldest and biggest trees in Ponce, and stops at a Cemetery which has been converted into a museum due to its historical significance. One trip on the trolley does not do it justice. It is a must see attraction on any vacation to Ponce.", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYS", "Title": "\u201cVery clean, comfortable hotel with more charm than Ponce itself\u201d", "Author": "babylovestravel", "ReviewID": "UR5286550", "Content": "We had a room with a king sized bed and a balcony, which was a bit noisy at night with the traffic below.

The bed was comfortable, lighting pleasant, a/c quiet and effective. I highly recommend the hotel, but not Ponce. The Lonely Planet guidebook we had was very misleading. We planned two nights there, but left after one. There was only one restaurant open for dinner. We walked and walked looking for someplace to eat breakfast, and the only place we could find was a food counter in a store. The center square was mostly deserted except for a few drunks, and was mostly just bare dirt around the trees. Only a couple of the buildings around it were nice.

They could not care less and advised me on leave the car somewhere in town and that meant 3 blocks away that a I had to walk back with my lugages because there where no personell at the hotel to help me. While I was doing that and when I arrived at the hotel, I was told that they could \"not find\" my reservation. It was late so I had to beg to the employee to make a new one and give me a room. The room was clean. Next day I checked out. Two weeks later I got two charges on my credit card, the one that I used and the one they found.

The Hotel was hard to locate based on the on-line directions we were given, but once we found it we were relieved to have a pleasant stay. The staff is very friendly, and eager to learn more English from mainland US natives. They asked us to park in a spot on the street where they could keep an eye on our car, and gave us an extra mattress for a member of our party without extra charge. Both the lobby and rooms have lots of character and charm. The lobby is covered on all sides with large ornate mirrors, and the very high ceilings in the rooms make the rooms almost as high as they are wide. The rooms opening to the front balconies do not have windows -- but that is ok; it makes it easier to sleep in without the morning light peaking through.

We followed Frommer's advice and requested room 8, 9, or 10, all of which have access to the balcony across the front of the building. We had a $65 reservation. The balcony rooms are normally $75, but they let us have one for $65 due to low occupancy that night. Our stay was Dec. 7, 2005. The balcony was nice, but it is shared with the other two rooms, so we didn't leave the shutter doors open at night. Also, being over the street, we were awakened by late-night revelers down below at 3AM - so the balcony rooms are a mixed blessing. Hotel was clean - receptionist was nice. Breakfast was just doughnut holes and coffee. Overnight parking was allowed on the street out in front. We initially requested the reservation via email, with no response to follow-ups in English or Spanish. We finally verified the reservation after several phone calls in Spanish. We gave them a credit card number, which was charged in full immediately. We would stay here again. FYI - There are free Internet computers at the Historic Archive office, across the plaza from the Belgica (#8 on their city tourist map).
