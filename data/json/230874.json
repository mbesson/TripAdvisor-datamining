Please beware that this hotel is quite far from the airport AND quite far from Rome. The easiest way to get to this hotel is to take a taxi from the airport. The hotel doesn't offer a shuttle bus, you can negotiate a fare from the Airport to the hotel. We were a group of 6, and negotiated 10 Euros a person for the ride from the airport to the hotel. The area around the hotel is quite deserted, a block and a half away there's a small plaza where there's a conveinence store, pizza shop, slot machines and a small restaurant. A 25 minute walk and there's a supermarket. This supermarket is quite a long walk, but it is quite a big supermarket that has everything you need. Checking in to the hotel was a quick process, not all the check-in agents know English, so just be patient and they'll be able to help you. There's complimentary wifi in the lobby and public areas. There's wifi and hardwired Internet available in the rooms for a fee. The fitness centre, and gym is open until 9pm. It was strange however we got to the fitness centre at around 8:30pm, and the attendent said that there's a 5 EURO charge to use the sauna. I'm not sure if this is correct or if he just wanted to discourage me to use the sauna because there was 30 minutes left until the fitness centre is closed. I should have mentioned this during my check-out, but I was in a rush to catch my flight and didn't have time to complain about the sauna. The room that I was in was very modern, and they also included a free bottle of sparkling water in the fridge in my room. Plenty of channels available on tv, and the washroom was clean, quite modern and acceptable. If I had a choice, I wouldn't stay at this hotel due to its location, it is very far from the airport, and very far from the city.

The participants came from all over Europe, so this hotel was chosen because it's relatively close to the airport. It's however an ordeal to get into the historic city of Rome. First you have to get a bus to reach a metro station, then it's a switch to the subway. They are not really coordinated, so there could be a 15-20 minute wait between metro/bus, depending on time and day of the week. Taxi is available, but not cheap. The food for us was fine, a buffet where one could choose from various hot and cold dishes plus a dessert. One of the nights we tried to get a drink in the bar on the lobby, but there was no one around to be found to serve us, so we skipped that idea. My room actually was two rooms, first was a 'sitting room' with a minibar and a sofa - I never used it. The bedroom and bathroom were clean, but I had problems with the heavy smell of perfume that was absolutely overwhelming! My first reaction when I first entered the room was to open the windows wide, to have some fresh air in! I complained to the reception, and also left a note (in Italian) to the maid, and I don't think they put more perfume in, but the smell lingered... I pointed out to them that it could be dangerous for people with asthma or other respiratory problems, or allergies. I don't understand why they didn't think of that themselves! In my room I had a free wifi internet connection, which I understand is not standard, but it was often very slow.

I decided to stay here even though this hotel is NOT IN ROME because I had some points that I thought I\u2019ll use. I also purchased some points to get the necessary figure for the 5 nights stay. First of all this is not a four star hotel and SPG should disassociate itself from this hotel as soon as it can! I knew we had made the wrong choice about a hotel in Rome when it took us 4 hours after baggage claim from Rome Fumicino airport to get to this hotel. We took the Buzshuttle for EUR 8 per person to Rome Termini. Walk into the Termini station which is about 5 mins from where the bus drops off. Cobble stone streets and dragging luggage, this was not fun! Then find a newspaper stand and buy the ticket, then look for the blue line and take one to EUR Fermi. This by itself is a village outside Rome. The hotel website says that you can take bus 705 from right outside EUR Fermi. It may sound easy but it\u2019s not. None of the outer stations have escalators, so with luggage climbing up 2-3 flights of stairs from the metro out to the street is again NOT FUN! Then after waiting for 15 mins we realised that 705 comes at the other side of EUR Fermi; so we crossed the road only to find out that there\u2019s another set of stairs that go down (not up) to another bus stand. Again, no escalators. Then we had to tell the bus driver we needed to get to Four Points and he didn\u2019t know where it was. As you can see, we were frustrated with the hotel even before getting there. The taxis will cost you EUR 70 (if they knew you are a tourist). Here are some of the reasons I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. I have gotten better service from a 2-star hotel: - Hotel is NOT IN ROME even thought their address says Rome. It takes you 1 hour and 15 mins to get to Termini station (which is the main station). Then you need to find your way via bus or metro. Not advisable if you are here for sight-seeing. - Do not depend on the bus and metro timings listed. Buses and trains come and go in their own time. Bus 705 and 130 (Sundays only) take you to EUR Fermi and then you take line B to get to Termini. But this is unreliable if you are staying in Rome for sight-seeing. If you have a flight to catch, take a taxi or a private car, whatever the cost! You don\u2019t want to miss your flight. - No one came forward to help us with luggage at check-in at the hotel - Air conditioning will NOT be turned on in April when it is 30 degrees C at night inside the room. My husband and I couldn\u2019t sleep for 4 out of our 5 nights stay. One night we had to fight with the reception to ask for air con and they said they will be doing us a FAVOUR by turning it on only for the one night. - A/C vent unclean and sends out a foul smell when a/c is turned on by the technician from the outside. You cannot control the air con in your room. Now which four star hotel does that?! - Sheets were not changed even though I had placed the \u201cchange sheets\u201d card on the bed. I had to call reception again and have housekeeping come back in again and change the sheets. - No bars or restaurants near the hotel. You would be better off eating your dinner in central Rome. But be aware that the Metro Line B runs only till 9:00 pm. So either eat early, or take-out food and get back to the hotel in time. - Breakfast was not included in our rate because of points. It\u2019s 25 EUR per person. Apparently, the reception staff told us that it was a discounted rate. The original breakfast was EUR 50. I walked to the closest supermarket Carrefour (1 km away) and bought breakfast stuff for our 4 days in under EUR 25 (for BOTH of us!). - Uncomfortable bed. I had back and neck aches every morning - No coffee making machine inside the room. Room service charge is EUR 15 per tray! I haven\u2019t even heard of this in 5-star hotels. - No free internet/wifi (except in the lobby). We used the free wifi in the lobby once. - Rude reception staff. Surprisingly the housekeeping staff seemed nicer. Like I said, the man at the reception actually told us that he will be doing us a \u201cFAVOUR by turning on the air con\u201d for the one night. It was the weirdest experience and I felt sorry for putting my husband through such crappy experience because I had used my points for the stay. Rome was the last leg of our 18 day vacation and we thought we had booked the best stay for our last part of the vacation but we were totally disappointed. My husband and I are both frequent travellers and have never had such experience even from a 2 star hotel much less an SPG! Now I notice that they've changed the name of the hotel from Four Points by Sheraton Roma West Hotel to Nicolaus Hotels Roma West. Does that mean SPG has removed this hotel from their properties?

As my husband and I are vacation owners of the Westin Kaanapali resort in Maui, we were able to get 3 rooms(based on SPG points). It's a level 2 hotel for SPG points which means I can get more rooms for less points. Since we are Starwood Preferred Guest gold members, they upgraded all the 3 rooms to a junior suite. The hotel isn't in the center of the city, but take the bus across the street in the back of the hotel(705 bus) takes you directly to the Eur Fermi subway station. Take the blue line and it takes you directly to the center of Rome(stops at the Coliseum, Circus Maximus, and Termini). You can transfer in Termini to the Red line to take you to Spagna(Spanish Steps) or there's a stop before Spagna for the Trevi Fountain. Costs 1 euro one way/ 2 euro round trip, cheap(you can buy metro tickets at any newspaper stand shops or little stores which are close to the hotel). It's cheaper to do this than the hop on/hop off tour in Rome, and saves you time as traffic in Rome is very busy. As I mentioned earlier, the hotel isn't in the center, but transportation is very convenient to take you to the center of Rome. If you stop in Termini, it's only a 5 min walk to the Grayline office, which you can get tours from there(ie Imperial Rome, Night tours, Vatican Museums, etc). The public bus/subways run from 5:30 am until midnight. Also, the hotel is located in a charming neighborhood. There's little shops and cafes around, and a bank within walking distance of the hotel. One of the restaurants we went, near the hotel treated us like family. After going there 3 times, they actually gave us complimentary home cooked meal on our last day. You get to experience more of local life than just the touristy part of Rome, which the suburb is definitely more quieter. There's also a couple of flea markets in the area, where it's cheaper to buy than in the touristy areas of Rome. The room rate from what I saw at the Four Points is definitely less than hotels in the center of Rome(I stayed at a hotel in the center close to the Roman Forum and ruins 8 years ago), and this hotel has larger rooms than a lot of the hotels in the center of the city(unless you're willing to pay big money for a larger room in the touristy area of the city). Great value, clean, larger rooms, and great access to public transportation for cheap to the center of the city, and if you don't mind actually exploring outside of the city.

The hotel was about a third of the price (redeeming Starpoints) of a more convenient location, and we were willing to spend an hour or two a day on the shuttle to save that. When we checked in on 1/31/2010, we were informed that the shuttle would no longer be free starting the next day (2/1/2010). It would be 5 Euros per person per trip, or 8 Euros per person per roundtrip. With four of us, that would have been 32 Euros per day. I said that was unacceptable. It was promoted as free when we booked the hotel and we had never been notified of any changes. I demanded to talk with the manager and was told that he would be in the next morning. I insisted that she call him immediately and that I would not stay there if they charged us for the shuttle. A few minutes later, he came out to talk to me. (HUH? He was there and they tried to pretend he wasn't?!?!?!) He said they would not charge us for the shuttle. When we got to the room, we couldn't get the lights to work. We finally figured out that the electronic keycard has to be put in the slot by the door. The rooms were very poorly soundproofed. We could hear road noise all night and noise from the room above us. The beds were the most uncomfortable I've ever slept on in a major chain. There was a fridge in the room, which was nice. The shuttle was fairly convenient and reliable for us. We made reservations the day before. One day it was full (and a couple people without reservations were turned away), but most of the time we were the only ones on it. The shuttle reeked of cigarette smoke, but what doesn't in Europe. One day, it left the Rome pickup 12 minutes early - fortunately, we were early. On another day, it was 20 minutes late. We found a good grocery store and a great restaurant, each within walking distance (about a kilometer away). Since we used Starpoints, breakfast wasn't included. The normal price for the buffet is 25 Euros per person. We spent less than 25 Euros at the grocery store and had drinks, croissants, snacks, fruit, yougurt, cheese, meat, and more to last all four of us all four days. I highly recommend the restaurant that the hotel suggested (La Bomboniera). They're open for dinner after 7pm Tuesday through Sunday, and their pastas and pizzas were great. It was a little difficult to find the first time, but was worth it. Overall, it was a fair value but far more inconvenient than I had expected.

The ride into the city was nice, and we were dropped at the edge of the Ancient City, so it was a bit of a walk to reach most sites. We didn't mind too much though. The drive to and from was a bit long, but lots of neat stuff too see out the window and lots of time to rest up on the drive in. The hotel itself was very nice. The breakfast was AMAZING, and we ate well every day. The restaurant and bar menus were nice and the food and booze was good. The room was quite nice, and we had more than enough room. The Internet was not free, but that was ok, because neither of us really needed to use it. The neighbour hood around the hotel was quiet and fairly walkable. There were a lot of great little places around if you're hungry, and there was even a small market that sold fruits and veggies. A bank was also nearby, helpful when you need to grab some cash before heading into the City. The hotel staff were all very nice and helpful to us. We were especially happy to meet one of the bartenders, a friendly fellow by the name of Fabrizio. The pool was nice and bright, but the jacuzzi was closed. All in all, this is really nice place to stay. You do not always have to stay in the centre of the action to enjoy your stay.
