{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not good value for money Stayed 4 nights at this courtyard hotel and it is a bit of a con. They actually have two premises - at no. 67and no. 71. I turned up at the listed address only to be run down the road to their other premises which had none of the listed facilities. No restaurant, no banquet hall etc, no room service. i wandered up to the main premises to try the restaurant and was met with a wall of no english and pointing that I was staying at the other premises and was clearly not welcome. The room was clean but the bed was rock hard - a chinese trait. The drains backed up in the shower after about 20 seconds which is probably a good water saving technique because you have to turn the shower off but not what i wanted. The location is also not that convenient to the Forbidden City as their map would lead you to believe. Given the number of hotels in Beijing that are a lot cheaper and that i didnt get the hotel that I paid for, I do not think this is good value for money.", "Date": "Nov 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR973663654", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "plbk4"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d633555-r22018449-Jin_Ya_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "633555", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
