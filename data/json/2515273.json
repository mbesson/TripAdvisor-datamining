The room was clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly, the rate was very reasonable, and the hotel is located in a safe area (important for two women traveling on their own) and is only a block or two from the Place d'Italie Metro station. It's true that the room was small but since we didn't go to Paris to hang around the hotel, it was fine for us. We didn't have the hotel breakfast - it seemed expensive to me - but there are plenty of cafes and boulangeries nearby that are even open on Sunday mornings. If I'm ever lucky enough to travel to Paris again, I would definitely stay here.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aalsmeer, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cLovely stay\u201d", "Author": "AnneM0", "ReviewID": "UR124146053", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in this hotel in November 2011. As written by others the rooms are indeed very small, though clean and comfortable. The hotel is located in a ' village like' area of Paris a bit off the beaten track.

Pleasant staff, sufficient breakfast, easy access via metro and a nice shopping mall can be reached within a few minutes by foot.

It was very clean, same with the bathroom (which was small again, but totally fine, clean and everything worked). It is right by the place d'italie metro station, and there were a few good cafes/restaurants in the area. It was really easy to get to/from the airport (CDG) and the area felt safe (we arrived by metro at about 11pm with our bags and felt safe walking to the hotel). It took about 10 minutes max on the metro to get to touristy places. The breakfast was good and was about 8 euro each. The hotel was quiet and friendly, and I would defintely stay here again. If you don't mind not being within walking distance to the tourist attractions and are happy to take the short metro rides (very easy to figure out) I would reccommend Jacks as a good cheap place to stay anytime.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mid-West", "Title": "\u201cJack's is a great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "PilgrimMid_West", "ReviewID": "UR13826279", "Content": "We have stayed at this hotel two times.
